{{History of Kosovo}}
The worst ethnic violence in [[Kosovo]] since the end of the 1999 conflict erupted in the partitioned town of [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovica]], leaving hundreds wounded and at least 14 people dead. [[UN]] peacekeepers and [[Nato]] troops scrambled to contain a raging gun battle between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fourteen dead as ethnic violence sweeps Kosovo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/18/balkans|website=theguardian.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Serbia the events were also called the March Pogrom.

International courts in Pristina have prosecuted several people who attacked several Serbian Orthodox churches, handing down jail sentences ranging from 21 months to 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bitter Memories of Kosovo’s Deadly March Riots|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/bitter-memories-of-kosovo-s-deadly-march-riots|website=balkaninsight.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|2}}

==Background==
The [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA) was an ethnic-Albanian [[paramilitary]] organisation which had as its founding goal unification of Albanian inhabited lands in the Balkans, stressing [[Albanian culture]], ethnicity and nation.&lt;ref name="Yoshihara71"&gt;{{harvnb|Yoshihara|2006|p=68}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perritt29"&gt;{{harvnb|Perritt|2008|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KoktsidisDam165166"&gt;{{harvnb|Koktsidis|Dam|2008|pp=165–166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict escalated from 1997 onward due to the Yugoslavian army retaliating with a crackdown in the region resulting in violence and population displacements.&lt;ref name="Yoshihara71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldman308373"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|1997|pp=308, 373}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan178"&gt;{{harvnb|Allan|Zelizer|2004|p=178}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The bloodshed, ethnic cleansing of thousands of Albanians driving them into neighbouring countries and the potential of it to destabilize the region provoked intervention by international organizations and agencies, such as the United Nations, NATO and [[International non-governmental organization|INGO]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=Robert S.|title=International organizations: A comparative approach to the management of cooperation|p=129|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275965495}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yoshihara|first=Susan Fink|chapter=Kosovo|pp=67–68|editor1-last=Reveron|editor1-first=Derek S.|editor2-last=Murer|editor2-first=Jeffrey Stevenson|title=Flashpoints in the War on Terrorism|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135449315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people from non-Albanian communities such as the Serbs and Romani fled Kosovo fearing revenge attacks by armed people and returning refugees while others were pressured by the KLA and armed gangs to leave.&lt;ref name="Herring232234"&gt;{{harvnb|Herring|2000|pp=232–234}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Post conflict Kosovo was placed under an international United Nations framework with the ''[[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]]'' (UNMIK) overseeing administrative affairs and the ''[[Kosovo Force|UN Kosovo Force]]'' (KFOR) dealing with defence.&lt;ref name="Herring232"&gt;{{harvnb|Herring|2000|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Within post-conflict Kosovo Albanian society, calls for retaliation for previous violence done by Serb forces during the war circulated through public culture.&lt;ref name="Herscher14"&gt;{{harvnb|Herscher|2010|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, prolonged negotiations over Kosovo's future status, sociopolitical problems and nationalist sentiments resulted in the Kosovo unrest.&lt;ref name="RauschBanar246"&gt;{{harvnb|Rausch|Banar|2006|p=246}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Egleder79"&gt;{{harvnb|Egleder|2013|p=79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
===Shooting of Serbian teen===
On 15 March 2004 an 18-year-old Serb, Jovica Ivić, was murdered in a drive-by shooting in the village of [[Čaglavica]] in the central region of Kosovo.&lt;ref name="15march-B92"&gt;{{cite news|title=U Čaglavici pucano na srpskog mladića iz automobila u pokretu|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2004&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=15&amp;nav_category=12&amp;nav_id=135320|accessdate=21 December 2014|agency=Beta|publisher=B92|date=15 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===16 March pro-KLA protests===
On 16 March, three KLA war veterans associations organized widespread demonstrations in ethnic Albanian cities and towns, protesting the arrests of former KLA leaders on war crime charges, including the February arrests of four commanders.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=17}} The pro-KLA, anti-UNMIK protests, with 18,000 protesters, lay the basis for the following demonstrations sparked by the sensational reports of drowning of three Albanian children.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=18}}

===Drowning of Albanian children===
On 16 March, three Albanian children drowned in the Ibar River in the village of Čabar, near the Serb community of [[Zubin Potok]]. A fourth boy survived. It was speculated that he and his friends had been chased into the river by Serbs in revenge for the shooting of Ivić the previous day, but this claim has not been proven.&lt;ref name="bbc-no-evidence"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3667839.stm | publisher = BBC | title = No evidence over Kosovo drownings  | date=2004-04-28 | accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN police spokesman Neeraj Singh said the surviving boy had been under intense pressure from ethnic Albanian journalists who had suggested what he should say. His version of events differed from that of two other children who had also been in the river, Singh told a news conference in Pristina. The spokesperson said there were "very significant" inconsistencies in the accounts given by the child during two separate interviews, and a lack of corroboration of his story. "In fact, it is logically at odds in several respects with other evidence," Mr. Singh said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/node/146375|title=Lack of evidence stalls probe into drowning of 3 Kosovo children, UN Mission says|work=ReliefWeb|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="setimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/bs/features/setimes/features/2004/04/040429-SVETLA-001|title=UN Investigation Clears Serbs of Kosovo Drownings|date=29 April 2004|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN found no evidence that Serbs were responsible for drowning the three Albanian children.&lt;ref name="setimes.com"/&gt;

==Violence==
{{moresources|section|date=July 2018}}
[[File:Facade of Serb House Destroyed in 2004 Pogrom - Prizren - Kosovo - 02.jpg|thumb|250px|Ruins of a Kosovo Serb house in [[Prizren]] that was destroyed by rioters.]]

On 17 and 18 March 2004, a wave of violent riots swept through Kosovo, triggered by two incidents perceived as ethnically-motivated acts. Demonstrations, although seemingly spontaneous at the outset, quickly focused on Serbs throughout Kosovo.
27 people were killed (11 Kosovo Albanians, 16 Kosovo Serbs), more than 900 persons were injured (including 65 international police officers and 58 Kosovo Police Service officers), and more than 800 buildings destroyed or damaged (including 29 churches or monasteries). 

By one estimate, more than 50,000 people participated in the riots. The Legal System Monitoring Section of the OSCE Mission in Kosovo (“the OSCE”) has closely monitored the investigations and trials from March 2004 until present. With its monitoring of 73 cases (Municipal, District and Minor Offences Courts) pending between December 2005 and March 2008, the OSCE now follows up on a first report of December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organization for Security an d Co-operation in Europe MISSION IN KOSOVO Monitoring Department, Legal System Monitoring Section|url=https://www.osce.org/kosovo/32700?download=true|website=osce.org|publisher=OSCE|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of Albanians gathered at the south end of the bridge across the Ibar at [[Kosovska Mitrovica]], which divides the Serb and Albanian districts of the town. A large crowd of Serbs gathered at the north end to prevent the Albanians from crossing. Peacekeepers from the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) blockaded the bridge, using tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades to keep the crowds apart. However, gunmen on both sides opened fire with sub-machine guns and grenades, killing at least eight people (two Albanians and six Serbs) and wounding over 300. Eleven peacekeepers were also injured, of which two seriously.

The violence quickly spread to other parts of Kosovo, with Kosovo Serb communities and Serbian cultural heritage (churches and monasteries) attacked by crowds of Albanians. Serb returnees were attacked.{{sfn|B92 Specijal|2004}} Some of the locations were ostensibly under the protection of KFOR at the time. During the riots and violence, eight Serbs were killed. Among damaged property were at least 35 churches, including 18 [[Cultural Heritage of Serbia|monuments of culture]], demolished, burnt or severely damaged.&lt;ref name="B92-1"/&gt; The casualty toll at the end of the day was 28 and 600 people were injured, including 61 peacekeepers and 55 police officers.

===Čaglavica===
In [[Čaglavica]], 12,000 Kosovo Albanian rioters tried to storm the Serb-populated areas. Norwegian [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] peacekeepers created a blockade by using tear gas, rubber bullets, and stun grenades, in order to keep the two groups apart. A truck was driven by a Kosovo Albanian at full speed towards the barricade in an attempt to penetrate the line. After firing warning shots at the truck, the Norwegians had to use deadly force to avoid friendly casualties, and shot the driver. 16 Norwegian peacekeepers were injured, and 13 had to be evacuated.&lt;ref name="forsvaret-video"&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Kjell-Olav Myhre|year=2014|title=Kosovo 2004: 12000 kosovoalbanerne angriper den kosovoserbiske landsbyen Caglavica|trans-title=Kosovo 2004: 12,000 Kosovo Albanians assault the Kosovo Serb village of Caglavica|language=Norwegian|url=http://forsvaret.no/sites/video/PublishingImages/veterandagen-2014-kjellolav/veteran-2014-kjellolavmyhre.mp4|accessdate=9 May 2014|publisher=Forsvaret (Norwegian Armed Forces)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714072330/http://forsvaret.no/sites/video/PublishingImages/veterandagen-2014-kjellolav/veteran-2014-kjellolavmyhre.mp4|archivedate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another KFOR unit consisting of mostly Swedish soldiers also participated in defending Čaglavica that day, supported by people from the barracks who normally worked with non-military tasks. Lieutenant Colonel Hans Håkansson, who commanded 700 people during the unrest, reported that the fighting went on for 11 hours, and that many collapsed due to dehydration and injuries while struggling to fend off waves of rioters.&lt;ref name=Zaremba&gt;{{cite news|last=Zaremba|first=Maciej|title=Mandom, mod och landstingstossor|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/kulturdebatt/mandom-mod-och-landstingstossor|accessdate=9 May 2014|newspaper=Dagens Nyheter|date=15 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 35 people were injured while defending the town.&lt;ref name=Zaremba/&gt; Hans Håkansson was awarded with a medal for his actions by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gotländsk militär får belöningsmedalj|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=94&amp;artikel=729267|accessdate=11 January 2015|agency=Sveriges Radio|publisher=P4 Gotland|date=8 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Priština===
Following the attacks in [[Čaglavica]], the mob of Albanians turned their attention on the few remaining Serbs living in [[Priština]] in the YU Program apartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2004/07/25/failure-protect/anti-minority-violence-kosovo-march-2004 |title=Failure to Protect,Anti-Minority Violence in Kosovo, March 2004|publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apartments came under attack after the mob of Albanians blocked all of the entrances and set fire to the ground floors. Serbs who tried to flee the apartments were shot at by firearms or stabbed by members of the crowd. The mob began to loot apartments and were chanting pro [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] chants and calling for the killing of Serbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2004/07/25/failure-protect/anti-minority-violence-kosovo-march-2004 |title=Failure to Protect,Anti-Minority Violence in Kosovo, March 2004|publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] and [[UNMIK]] police over 6 hours to evacuate the Serbs who were under constant fire from armed Albanians. Following the evacuation the crowd began to converge on the [[Church of Christ the Saviour, Pristina| Church of the Christ Savour]] burning and damaging the facade and inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2004/07/25/failure-protect/anti-minority-violence-kosovo-march-2004 |title=Failure to Protect,Anti-Minority Violence in Kosovo, March 2004|publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peć===
Albanians rioted in the city of [[Peć]], attacking [[UN]] offices. One Albanian was killed by UN police.{{sfn|B92 Specijal|2004}} Serb returnees were attacked at [[:sh:Belo Polje (Pe%C4%87)|Belo Polje]].{{sfn|B92 Specijal|2004}}

===Lipljan===
Albanians and KFOR were engaged in gunfights in the town of [[Lipljan]]. Four Serbs were murdered, while Serbs taking refuge in the local Orthodox church were attacked.{{sfn|B92 Specijal|2004}}

===Vučitrn===
All Serb houses in the Serb-inhabited village of [[Svinjare]] in Vučitrn, near Kosovska Mitrovica, were burnt down.&lt;ref name=Zaremba/&gt;

===Prizren===
On 17 March, ethnic Albanians started attacking the Serb settlement in Prizren, including the Seminary, and reportedly there was no UNMIK, [[Kosovo Police]] and KFOR present there at the time.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=54}} The mob set the Seminary on fire, with people inside, and beat several elder people, with one man dying in the burning.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|pp=54-55}} 

The German KFOR's refusal to mobilize to protect the local Serbs are one of the main security failures of the 2004 unrest.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=55}} UNMIK in Prizren said that the terror, 56 Serb houses and 5 historical churches that were burnt down, could have been prevented by the KFOR.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=55}}

==Destroyed churches==

Kosovo Albanian politicians such as President [[Ibrahim Rugova]] and Prime Minister [[Bajram Rexhepi]] joined UN governor Harri Holkeri, NATO southern commander Gregory Johnson, and other KFOR officials in condemning the violence and appealing for peace in Kosovo.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=59}}

Kosovo Police established a special investigation team to handle cases related to the 2004 unrest and according to Kosovo Judicial Council by the end of 2006 the 326 charges filed by municipal and district prosecutors for criminal offenses in connection with the unrest had resulted in 200 indictments: convictions in 134 cases, and courts acquitted eight and dismissed 28; 30 cases were pending.

==Reactions in Serbia==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
The events in Kosovo brought an immediate angry reaction on the streets of Serbia. On the evening of 17 March, crowds gathered in [[Belgrade]], [[Novi Sad]] and [[Niš]] to demonstrate against the treatment of the Kosovo Serbs. Despite appeals for calm by [[Amfilohije Radović|Metropolitan Amfilohije]], the 17th-century [[Bajrakli Mosque, Belgrade|Bajrakli Mosque]] was set on fire. Islam Aga mosque in the southern city of Niš was also set on fire, while demonstrators chanted "Kill, kill Albanians!" When police arrived the mosque was already burning and some media reported that the police didn't move the crowd, so they blocked the fire fighters access to the mosque, leaving them unable to extinguish the fire.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2005/serbia1005/4.htm#_Toc115505925 Dangerous Indifference: Violence against Minorities in Serbia: March 2004 Violence Against Albanians and Muslims&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Both buildings were extensively damaged but were saved from complete destruction by the intervention of police and firefighters.&lt;ref name="f18"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=280 | publisher = [[F18 News]] | work = KOSOVO &amp; SERBIA | title = Churches &amp; mosques destroyed amid inter-ethnic violence | accessdate= 23 May 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also properties of Muslim minorities, such as Goranis, Turks or Albanians were vandalized in Novi Sad and other cities throughout Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2005/serbia1005/4.htm|title=Dangerous Indifference: Violence against Minorities in Serbia: March 2004 Violence Against Albanians and Muslims|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch has concluded that the Serbian state failed to prosecute violence in Novi Sad.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt;

The Serbian government publicly denounced the violence in Kosovo. Prime Minister [[Vojislav Koštunica]] strongly criticized the failure of NATO and the UN to prevent the violence, and called for a state of emergency to be imposed on Kosovo. He gave a speech blaming organized Albanian separatists: "The events in northern Kosovo-Metohija reveal the true nature of Albanian separatism, its violent and terrorist nature ...  [The government will] do all it can to stop the terror in Kosovo".&lt;ref name="bbc-media"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3523916.stm | publisher = BBC | title = Media fan Kosovo flames  | date=2004-03-18 | accessdate=2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister of Minority Rights of [[Serbia and Montenegro]], Rasim Ljajić, himself a Muslim, said "What is now happening in Kosovo confirms two things: that this is a collapse of the international mission, and a total defeat of the international community." Nebojsa Čović, the Serbian government's chief negotiator on matters relating to Kosovo, was sent to Kosovska Mitrovica on March 18 in a bid to calm the situation there. Serbian security forces also guarded the border between Serbia and Kosovo in a bid to prevent demonstrators and paramilitaries from entering the province to foment further unrest. The events were compared by Prime Minister Koštunica to [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3551571.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kosovo clashes 'ethnic cleansing' | date=20 March 2004 | accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serbs, represented by the "Union of Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija", described the ordeal as "genocide" in a letter sent to the Serbian and Russian patriarchs, to Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and the Serbian government, where, besides that, they quote the burning of seven villages during the World War II-German occupation to the "several hundreds" burnt "under the rule of the troops of Christian Europe and America" and according to which the "occupation of Kosovo surpasses all we had to sustain under fascism." The spared Serb villages are compared to "concentration camps" because of the missing [[freedom of movement]], electricity and heating. According to the letter, after 1999 there were 8,500 homicides or disappearances of non-Albanian people with no single accomplice tried.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravoslavie.ru/news/060415154741 Full text of the letter] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120910124959/http://www.pravoslavie.ru/news/060415154741 |date=2012-09-10 }} in Russian, in the name of 120 000 Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, seven years after the incident, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić spoke at the Wheaton College in Chicago:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In less than 72 hours, 35 churches and monasteries were set on fire, many of which date back to the 14th century or even further away in history, which represents an irretrievable loss for the mankind. Dozens of people were killed. Several thousand were wounded. Thousands of houses and shops were leveled to the ground. More than 4,000 Kosovo Serbs were expelled from their homes.&lt;ref name="B92-1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Serbia the events were also called the March Pogrom.&lt;ref name="WashingtonTimes"&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/apr/9/20050409-102733-9741r/ Anti-Serb programs in Kosovo], By The Washington Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B92-1"&gt;B92.net, ''[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=18&amp;nav_id=73300 FM talks Kosovo at U.S. college]'', 18 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/ci/story/1/%D0%A1%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0/570011/%D0%A8%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82+%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0+%D0%BE%D0%B4+%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3+%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0+.html Шест година од мартовског погрома] RTS.rs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/teme/teme.97.html:tema-167-Martovski-pogrom Martovski pogrom] Večernje novosti&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravoslavie.ru/news/51111.htm|title=ЕПИСКОП ФЕОДОСИЙ ПРОТИВ ПЕРЕДАЧИ МОНАСТЫРЯ ПОД ОХРАНУ КОСОВСКОЙ ПОЛИЦЕЙСКОЙ СЛУЖБЫ|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reaction==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2018}}

The international community was taken by surprise by the sudden upsurge in violence. Kosovo had been fairly quiet since the end of 1999, although there had been occasional small-scale ethnic clashes throughout the past five years and an ongoing tension between Serbs and Albanians. This had, however, largely gone unnoticed by the Western media since 1999.

KFOR troops closed Kosovo's borders with the remainder of Serbia and Montenegro and the UN suspended flights in and out of the province. NATO announced on 18 March that it would send another 1,000 troops – 750 of them from the [[United Kingdom]] – to reinforce the 18,500 troops already there.&lt;ref name="nato"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nato.int/shape/news/2004/03/i040318a.htm |title=NATO deploys "prudent reinforcements" to Kosovo in response to violence |publisher=[[NATO]] |accessdate=23 May 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529195314/http://www.nato.int/shape/news/2004/03/i040318a.htm |archivedate=29 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN and [[European Union]] both appealed for calm, calling on local leaders to restrain their supporters. [[UN Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] urged both sides to cooperate with the peacekeeping forces but pointedly reminded the Kosovo Albanians that they had a responsibility "to protect and promote the rights of all people within Kosovo, particularly its minorities".

An Austrian [[OSCE]] official called the events an orchestrated plan to drive out the remaining Serbs, while one anonymous UNMIK official reportedly referred to the event as ''Kosovo's [[Kristallnacht]]''. The commander of NATO's South Flank, Admiral [[Gregory G. Johnson]], said on 19 March that the violence verged on ethnic cleansing of Serbs by Albanians. On 20 March, Kosovo's UN administrator, [[Harri Holkeri]], told journalists that "Maybe the very beginning was spontaneous but after the beginning certain extremist groups had an opportunity to orchestrate the situation and that is why we urgently are working to get those perpetrators into justice."&lt;ref name="bbc-blame"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3553837.stm | publisher = BBC | title = Kosovo clashes 'orchestrated'  | date=2004-03-20 | accessdate=2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]], at least 19 people died—11 Albanians and eight Serbs—and over 1,000 were injured while some 730 houses belonging to minorities, mostly Kosovo Serbs, as well as 36 Orthodox churches, monasteries and other religious and cultural sites were damaged or destroyed. In less than 48 hours, 4,100 minority community members were newly displaced (more than the total of 3,664 that had returned throughout 2003), of whom 82% were Serbs and the remaining 18% included Romani (and Ashkali) as well as an estimated 350 Albanians from the Serb-majority areas of [[Kosovska Mitrovica]] and [[Leposavić]].

*{{flagicon|France}} [[France]] pledged to send about 400 more troops immediately to the region after the violence began.&lt;ref name="kosovo clashes" /&gt;

*{{flagicon|Serbia}} Serbian Prime Minister [[Vojislav Koštunica]] described the attacks as "planned in advance and co-ordinated... this was an attempted pogrom and ethnic cleansing" against Kosovo's Serbs.&lt;ref name="kosovo clashes" /&gt;

The '''absent-minded professor''' is a [[stock character]] of popular fiction, usually portrayed as a talented [[academic]] whose academic brilliance is accompanied by below-par functioning in other areas, leading to forgetfulness and mistakes. One explanation of this is that highly talented individuals often have unevenly distributed capabilities, being brilliant in their field of choice but below average on other measures of ability. Alternatively, they are considered to be so engrossed in their field of study that they forget their surroundings. 

The [[phrase]] "absent-minded professor" is also commonly used more generally in [[English language|English]] to describe people who are so engrossed in their "own world" that they fail to keep track of their surroundings. It is a common [[stereotype]] that [[professor]]s get so obsessed with their research that they pay little attention to anything else.

The stereotype is very old: the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] biographer [[Diogenes Laërtius]] wrote that the philosopher [[Thales]] walked at night with his eyes focused on the heavens and, as a result, fell down a [[Water well|well]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ''Lives of the Eminent Philosophers'', "Thales"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of real absent-minded professors==
[[Isaac Newton]],&lt;ref name=name1&gt;[https://books.google.com.br/books?id=2OCKrF6YNKEC&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;dq=feynman%20absent-minded%20scientist&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q=feynman%20absent-minded%20scientist&amp;f=false], p.ix&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Smith]], [[André-Marie Ampère]], [[Jacques Hadamard]], [[Sewall Wright]], [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Norbert Wiener]], [[Archimedes]], [[Pierre Curie]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.br/books?id=s3vieJGqDooC&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=feynman%20absent-minded%20scientist&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q=feynman%20absent-minded%20scientist&amp;f=false], p.76&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Albert Einstein]]&lt;ref name=name1/&gt; were all scholars considered to be absent-minded &amp;ndash; their attention absorbed by their academic studies. [[William Archibald Spooner]], who gave his name to the [[spoonerism]], was known for his [[absent-mindedness]] and eccentricity.

==Fictitious absent-minded professors==
"Doc" [[Emmett Brown]] from ''[[Back to the Future]]'' is an example of an absent-minded professor in film. Another example is the title character in the film ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'' and its less successful film remakes, all based on the short story "A Situation of Gravity" by [[Samuel W. Taylor]]. 

Examples in television include [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] in ''[[Futurama]]'', [[Professor Frink]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]'', [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter Bishop]] in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', and Professor Von Schlemmer in ''[[Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog]]''. Multo, one of the characters in the children's series ''[[The Zula Patrol]]'', is another example of an absent-minded professor. 

Professor Kokintz in ''[[The Mouse That Roared]]'' by [[Leonard Wibberley]] is an example from literature. [[Professor Branestawm]], created in the 1930s by [[Norman Hunter (author)|Norman Hunter]], is an earlier example of the archetype, and [[Jacques Paganel]] from the [[Jules Verne]]'s 1867 novel ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]'' is probably the codifier of the archetype in the modern literature. Professor Caractacus Potts in the story of ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (novel)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' qualifies as an absent-minded inventor. 

Comic strip examples include [[Professor Calculus]] in ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''; Eli Eon in ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]''; and Professor Edgewise, a minor recurring character in [[Marvel Family]] stories. 

[[Isaac Kleiner]] from the ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'' saga and Professor Harold MacDougal from ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' are examples in videogames.

The archetype is sometimes mixed with that of the [[mad scientist]], often for comic effect, as in the [[Jerry Lewis]] film ''[[The Nutty Professor]]'' or the Profesor Bacterio in the ''[[Mortadelo y Filemón]]'' comics and movies. However, the mad scientist archetype usually has malevolent connotations, while the absent-minded professor is typically characterized as benevolent. 

The fictional absent-minded professor is often a college professor of science or engineering; in the [[fantasy]] genre, a similar character may appear as a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]]. Examples of this include the characterisation of [[Merlin]] in ''[[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' (particularly in [[The Sword in the Stone (film)|the Disney adaptation]]) and [[Albus Dumbledore]] in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series.

'''''Always Becoming''''' is an artwork created in 2007 by [[Nora Naranjo-Morse]] (born 1953), a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Pottery|Potter]] and [[poet]]. She currently resides in [[Española, New Mexico|Española]], [[New Mexico]], just north of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and is a member of the [[Santa Clara Pueblo]].

==Description==

The sculpture consists of five separate sculptures, that make up a family.

Grounded in figures from [[Santa Clara Pueblo]] oral tradition the sculptures are named:
* Father
* Mother
* Little one
* Moon Woman
* Mountain Bird

The sculptures were built in-situ over the summer of 2007, Nora Naranjo-Morse worked with her niece Athena Swentzell Steen and her husband Bill Steen who are experts at building structures with natural material, and the family of Don Juan Morales ([[Tepehuan]]) from the Mexican state of  [[Durango]], as well as many volunteers including museum staff and visitors.

{{quote|Being strangers at the beginning of this journey, we came from distant places with the intent to build sculptures, and in the process built a family as well.|Nora Naranajo-Morse, 2007 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmai.si.edu/alwaysbecoming/AlwaysBecoming.html|title=NMAI: NORA NARANJO-MORSE-ALWAYS BECOMING MALL SCULPTURE PROJECT|website=www.nmai.si.edu|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Materials==

The Sculptures are made entirely of natural materials: dirt, sand, straw, clay, stone, black locust wood, bamboo, grass, and yam vines. These natural elements were selected to take on a life of their own and thus affect the sculptures over time. In this way the materials ensure the forms are 'always becoming'.

==Dimensions==

The five sculptures range in size from seven and a half to sixteen feet tall.

==History and Location==

On May 24, 2006, the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] announced that Naranjo-Morse had won its outdoor sculpture design competition. "Always Becoming" was selected unanimously from more than 55 entries submitted by Native artists from throughout the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmai.si.edu/press/releases/2006-05-24_outdoor_sculpture_release_final_1.pdf|title=Press {{!}} National Museum of the American Indian|website=www.nmai.si.edu|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 2007, on the grounds of the National Museum of the American Indian, [[Washington, DC]], Naranjo-Morse built a family of clay sculptures. The commissioned work is located on the 'Native landscape' at the museum's south entrance on Maryland Avenue S.W. near 4th Street and Independence Avenue S.W., Washington, D.C.

A public dedication, officially opening these public works of art, took place on September 1, 2007.

The sculptures are intended to disintegrate over time, and the lives of sculptures from the initial idea through the continued process of [[stewardship]] are being documented by Filmmaker Dax Thomas ([[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]]/[[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]]). As the sculptures disintegrate the films of their life will form a more permanent record of their existence and are therefore an essential part of the artistic process, and the work of art itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/quatica|title=quatica|website=Vimeo|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Native culture and the environment served as the inspiration for the sculpture design.  'Always Becoming' will reflect themes of growth and adaptation and represent indigenous peoples' unique relationship to the environment, ...

The sculpture's metaphor of home and family not only conveys a universal theme to all peoples, but also enhances the visitors' experience that they have entered a Native place when they {{sic|step foot}} on the museum grounds.|Nora Naranajo-Morse, 2007 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caneloproject.com/pages/currrent%20projects/smithsonian.html|title=always becoming|website=www.caneloproject.com|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[File:Cafedudome2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Le Dôme Café]] in Paris.]]
'''Café society''' was the description of the "Beautiful People" and "Bright Young Things" who gathered in fashionable cafes and restaurants in New York, Paris, and London beginning in the late 19th century. [[Maury Henry Biddle Paul]] is credited with coining the phrase "cafe society" in 1915. [[Lucius Beebe]] created the term "chromium mist" for the cafe society lifestyle he chronicled in his weekly column, ''This New York,'' for the'' [[New York Herald Tribune]]'' during the 1920s and 1930s.

They attended each other's private dinners and balls, and took holidays in exotic locations or at elegant resorts. In the United States, café society came to the fore with the end of [[Repeal of Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in December 1933 and the rise of [[photojournalism]], to describe the set of people who tended to do their entertaining semi-publicly, in restaurants and night clubs, and who would include among them movie stars and sports celebrities. Some of the American night clubs and New York City restaurants frequented by the denizens of café society included the [[21 Club]], [[El Morocco]], Restaurant Larue, and the [[Stork Club]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The '''Canadian Anti-racism Education and Research Society''' (CAERS) is a [[Canadian]] non-profit organization that tracks hate groups and extremism, provides direct support to victims of racism and discrimination, and lobbies government and governmental agencies for the development of effective policy and legislation to stop racism. The social justice law firm, [http://www.rushcraneguenther.com/ Rush, Crane, Guenther], provides legal counsel. CAERS has been criticized for its tactics&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;forthcoming&lt;/ref&gt; and financial practices.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; CAERS maintains a website at [http://www.stopracism.ca/ Stopracism.ca ].

==Government Recognition==

In 1998, CAERS received the BC Eliminates Racism Together Award from the Ministry of Multiculturalism for research that led to exposing the head of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in [[British Columbia]] and organizing against hate.

In 2001, CAERS received an award from the [http://www.bcbudget.gov.bc.ca/2006/sp/ag/PerformancePlanMulticulturalismandImmigration10.htm Ministry of Multiculturalism and Immigration] for organizing provincial consultations for the [https://www.un.org/WCAR/ United Nations World Conference Against Racism]. According to the Minister:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Ministry of Multiculturalism and Immigration greatly acknowledges the important contribution to the United to Combat Racism: Equality-Dignity-Justice by the Canadian Anti-racism Education and Research Society. Your input, collaboration and leadership made this initiative [WCAR consultations] a success and effectively demonstrated the benefits when government and non-governmental organizations work together to build a society that is free from racism.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Lobbying Initiatives==

Five foreign trained medical doctors began a hunger strike in 1990 to draw attention to discrimination in the allocation of medical internships in the province of [[British Columbia]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canada.metropolis.net/research-policy/conversation/MATAPAPER.html Medical Internships]&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a request from the doctors, CAERS  and other representatives met with Bill Vander Zalm, then Premier of the province, and John Jensen, then Minister of Health, to demand that the Ministry of Health and the College of Physicians and Surgeons provide equal access for immigrant doctors to internship programs.  A report on the demands was written.&lt;ref&gt;Bitonti et al. (1990) Systemic Discrimination Against Foreign Trained Doctors in British Columbia&lt;/ref&gt; Meetings were also arranged with the College of Physicians and Surgeons and political opposition parties. Failing to achieve equal access, a complaint was made to the [http://www.bchrt.bc.ca/ BC Human Rights Tribunal] alleging discrimination in the allocation of internships by the [http://www.gov.bc.ca/health/ BC Ministry of Health], the [http://www.cpsbc.ca/ College of Physicians and Surgeons] and Hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Bitonti v. British Columbia (Ministry of Health No. 3) [BCHRT (1999), 36 CHRR D/263]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the Tribunal ruled that foreign trained doctors were discriminated against by the College based on place of origin, but that Hospitals and the BC Ministry of Health had not discriminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cdn-hr-reporter.ca/HRDigest-00-01.pdf# |title=Canadian Human Rights Reporter |access-date=2008-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011091831/http://www.cdn-hr-reporter.ca/HRDigest-00-01.pdf# |archive-date=2007-10-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, CAERS was invited to address the House of Commons legislative committee on proposed legislation to create the Canadian Race Relations Foundation (CRRF) as part of a reparations settlement for the internment of Japanese-Canadian during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crr.ca/ Canadian Race Relations Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; CAERS' submission was that the name of the CRRF was inappropriate and should not reflect popular misconceptions about the biological significance of the concept of "race" in socio-economic relations.  CAERS also argued that careful measures were needed to ensure that the Foundation would be at arms length from Government and that it should be a national voice on anti-racism to aid and support NGOs in the development of sustainable anti-racism initiatives.

In 1990, CAERS was requested to administer funding from the Canadian Labour Force Development Board to establish a national visible minority reference group for labour force development. The National Visible Minority (NVMC) arose from that funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nvmclfd.ca/# |title=National Visible Minority Council on Labour Force Development |access-date=2008-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118225724/http://www.nvmclfd.ca/# |archive-date=2006-01-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of hate groups and the widespread distribution of hate propaganda throughout North America, particularly in the early 1990s, led CAERS to lobby the [[Government of Canada]] to strengthen and broaden hate crime legislation, improve policing and lobby the various Attorneys General in each province to lay charges under the Criminal Code since the consent of the AG is a required before charges under the Criminal Code of Canada for the production and distribution of hate propaganda and advocating genocide can be laid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/?noCookie Criminal Code&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; No charges had been made to then for the production or distribution of hate propaganda under the Criminal Code. To assess the degree of the problem and proposed solutions, CAERS convened an international conference on racism, hate crime and the law funded by the province of British Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, A. (Editor) ''Racism, Hate Crime &amp; the Law'', 1995 {{ISBN|0969731213}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a request from the Department of Justice, CAERS prepared a report on the production and distribution of hate material by white supremacist organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, A. &amp; C. Cornish, Hate Propaganda: the Law Reform Division and Research and Statistics Section, Department of Justice, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the recommendations of the Racism, Hate Crime and the Law conference and the report prepared for the Department of Justice, CAERS began lobbying the Attorney General of BC to establish a dedicated policing unit focusing on hate crime. The first hate crime unit in Canada was soon formed with representation from various police forces in the province and the Community Liaison Branch of the Ministry of the Attorney General and in 1998 the Attorney General of BC gave CAERS an award for exposing the head of the KKK and for providing public education on how to stop the spread of racism.&lt;ref&gt;Local Anti-racist Organization Exposes Head of the Klan. Surrey Now, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Province&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no charges were laid against the Klan under the Criminal Code.

In 1997, CAERS warned that the Heritage Front and Odin’s Law were establishing themselves in [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] and in Vancouver’s Eastend and that violence would ensue.&lt;ref&gt;Brace for hate, Surrey warned. White Rock Now: September 6, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; On January 4, 1998 five racist skinheads kicked to death Mr. Nirmal Singh Gill outside the Guru Nanack temple.&lt;ref&gt;Five arrested for Murder. Surrey Now, April 22, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; CAERS was requested to develop a manual on combatting hate groups with funding from the Ministry of the Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;Cornish, C. &amp; A. Dutton (1998) Organizing Rules: A Strategic Guide to Combatting Hate Groups: CAERS&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Nazi and other extremist groups have historically used public facilities for meetings because of their low cost and because they lend credibility to their cause. (pic) In response to the use of publicly funded facilitates by hate groups, CAERS began lobbying all levels of government and holding demonstrations outside libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-race foes Angry, Times Colonist: Oct 27, 1996. 400 protest ‘hate’ meeting in library, The Province, June 21, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the [http://www.bcla.bc.ca/ BC Library Association] argued that libraries were independent of government control and that freedom of speech had no limits when libraries were concerned. The controversy about the responsible use of tax-payer supported institutions versus free speech generated a great deal of debate and a number of important motions by various city councils to develop acceptable use policy for publicly funded institutions.&lt;ref&gt;City bars likely hatemongers from publicly owned facilities, Times Colonist: November 8, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  A complaint to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080525113315/http://www.ombudsman.bc.ca/about_ombudsman/about_ombudsman.htm Ombudsman of BC] resulted in the recommendation that libraries in BC issue a written statement of acceptable use regarding meeting room rental much like the acceptable use policy governing computer use and sexually explicit images and that persons using libraries comply with all federal, provincial and municipal legislation and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Ombudsman Special Report No. 23 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Library board chair called the Ombudsman’s recommendations ludicrous.&lt;ref&gt;Controversy haunts library board, Times Colonist, April 4, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to a request from the Ministry of Community, Aboriginal and Women’s Services (MCAW) in 2004, Alan Dutton represented CAERS on a steering committee to establish a strategic direction on anti-racism and multiculturalism for British Columbia. The committee developed a "Blueprint for Change" document that was to guide ministry programs and activities for the next three to five years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Despite the representation by CAERS and other NGOs, the Government of BC ignored the major recommendations of the committee and began to isolate itself from grass roots organizations and NGOs in favour of five or six large immigrant settlement agencies in the province and to develop a [https://web.archive.org/web/20080602015518/http://www.amssa.org/safeharbour/index.html Safe Harbour] program without teeth, accountability or grass-roots community support. CAERS viewed the program as a fundamental shift from anti-racism to symbolic multiculturalism.

In 2007 the Department of Justice Canada conducted a national study to develop recommendations to better respond to hate on the Net, or cyber hate.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Slane, A. Combatting Hate on the Net: Current Canadian Efforts and the Recommendations of Non-Governmental Organizations to Improve upon Them, Department of Justice. December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A national conference was held in Toronto to examine the recommendations from the study. CAERS lobbied against one national hot line because of competing interests and definitions and for support of community hot lines and proactive measures to counter-act cyber hate and the recruitment of youth into extremist groups.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Community Initiatives==

CAERS has been instrumental in building community coalitions to expose and oppose racism across Canada. In 1992 CAERS helped form a coalition to boycott [http://www.jal.com/en/ Japanese Air Lines] (JAL) for alleged discriminatory seating and stop-over policy in Japan. An employee of [[Canadian Airlines]], the booking agent for JAL, revealed a written policy that ordered JAL attendants to seat Delhi-bound passengers at the back of the plane.&lt;ref&gt;Province, March 26, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; It was also alleged that hotel reservations for stopovers in Japan were discriminatory since Delhi-bound passengers were allocated basement accommodation. JAL denied that the seating and reservation policy were discriminatory. JAL agreed that there would be no seating and stop-over reservations without the consent of passengers.

In 1992, CAERS held a media conference and a rally to stop [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]] of the California-based [[White Aryan Resistance Movement]] (WAR) from organizing in B.C. Over 3,000 attended the anti-racist rally at the Vancouver Art Gallery in downtown Vancouver .{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} [[File:Vancouver rally.jpg|thumb|right| Rally against racism in Vancouver, B.C.

In the early 1990s, a local newspaper in the suburbs of Vancouver, the North Shore News, began to regularly publish articles suggesting that immigrants from Iran were taking over Canada, were responsible for crime and that the Holocaust did not occur. Authorities cited for these claims were [[Ernst Zündel]] and a number of European Holocaust deniers, including [[David Irving]]. CAERS organized demonstrations to denounce the publisher and newspaper. Two human rights complaints were subsequently filed under the BC Human Rights Code against the editor and the writer, [[Doug Collins (journalist)|Doug Collins]].

News of Charles Scott&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrt-tcdp.gc.ca/search/view_html.asp?doid=438&amp;lg=_e&amp;isruling=0 Decision regarding Chilliwack Anti-racism Society v. Charles Scott and the Church of Jesus Christ in Israel]&lt;/ref&gt; recruiting in the armed forces and schools in several smaller communities in BC broke in 1995. Scott was the Canadian leader of the racist Church of Christ in Israel. In response, CAERS worked with several groups, including Salmon Arm Coalition Against Racism and local Mayors to organize public events in each of the local communities Charles Scott had set up the group, including Abbotsford, Kelowna, Creston and Yahk.

Radio station [https://web.archive.org/web/20061121224807/http://www.team1040.ca/ AM 1040] broadcast a series of interviews in 1995 with Holocaust denier [[David Irving]], [[Doug Collins (journalist)|Doug Collins]] and leader of [[Aryan Nations]] in Canada, Charles Scott,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrt-tcdp.gc.ca/search/view_html.asp?doid=438&amp;lg=_e&amp;isruling=0] Chilliwack Anti-racism Society v. Charles Scott and the Church of Jesus Christ in Israel&lt;/ref&gt; CAERS gave interviews to several newspapers complaining that the radio station was providing a forum for racists. Radio station AM 1040 retaliated by suing CAERS and Alan Dutton for libel. Of the two newspapers that carried interviews with Dutton, only the Western Jewish Tribune was included in the libel suit. The issue was resolved when AM 1040 dropped the libel suit and paid legal costs.

In 1999 when Nirmal Sign Gill, a caretaker at the Guru Nanak Temple in Surrey, B.C., was kicked to death by five racist skinheads, CAERS helped from an anti-racist coalition to organize a mass community march and rally. The skinheads charged in the murder of care caretaker were caught by police surveillance planning to kill many more at the Temple. The call for a mass rally was opposed by several groups and by Surrey City Council that feared that the march and rally would end in violence. To fan the fears, the Vancouver Sun reported that the neo-Nazi [[Heritage Front]] was organizing a counter-demonstration. In July 1999 more than 3,000 men, women and children peacefully marched to Bear Creek Park to hear speeches and listen to music commemorating the death of Mr. Gill. The Surrey RAMP detachment supplied over 50 uniformed police officers for traffic control and security.

In response to requests from employees at a Surrey telephone call-in centre, CAERS organized a series of community meetings concerning employment and human rights.  The BC Government Employees Union had mounted a campaign to organize the employees and several had complained of retaliation from the employer. CAERS represented several employees at mediation hearings before the BC Human Rights Tribunal and Employment Insurance and won major settlements.

== Educational Initiatives ==

CAERS received support from the [http://www.nfb.ca/splash/splash.php?v=h&amp;lg=en National Film Board of Canada], the [http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/ Department of Canadian Heritage], the [http://www.gov.bc.ca/ Province of British Columbia] and [http://www.knowledgenetwork.ca/ Knowledge Network] to interview leaders and present and former members of racist groups to produce educational resources on the recruitment and recovery of youth from racist groups. Video-taped interviews were conducted with [[Ernst Zündel]], Charles Scott, Christopher Brodsky, Dan Sims, Kerry Noble, and Johnny Lee Carey.

In 1999, five hate crime conferences for aboriginal communities in the province were funded in 1998 &lt;ref&gt;Kelly A. MacDonald, Aboriginal Hate Crime Forums November 1999 Multiculturalism BC&lt;/ref&gt; and CAERS was tasked with presenting research on hate groups affecting Aboriginal Communities in each of the regional conferences.

Following a number of incidents in Correctional facilities in 1998, CAERS was tasked by Corrections Canada to develop a manual on racist symbols, to develop educational materials for Corrections staff, to deliver workshop for staff and to hold meetings with inmates on issues related to racism within Corrections.

In 1999 the United Nations proposed a world conference on racism and discrimination to be held in Durban South Africa and several regional preparatory conferences were held throughout the world. CAERS was a delegate of the Government of Canada to the European prep-conference held in Strasbourg, France and was funded to attend the main conference in Durban. In Canada, CAERS was commissioned to organize regional preparatory conferences for the WCAR by the BC Government. In 2001 the Ministry Of Multiculturalism And Immigration recognized CAERS with an award for community leadership for the work done for the WCAR. The Government of Canada also sponsored regional prep-conferences and CAERS was represented on the advisory committee and thematic sub-committees.

To address hate on the Net and its impact on youth, a conference, Anti-racism Online, was held with support from the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080615173628/http://www.nupge.ca/news_2002/news_no02/n18no02a.htm BC Human Rights Commission] and [https://www.sfu.ca/ Simon Fraser University].

Following several incidents between students of Asian and European descent, the Pitt Meadow School District contracted with CAERS to provide workshops on anti-racism and to conduct meetings between faculty and student groups. Over the course of several months, tensions were reduced and new guidelines were developed for dealing with complaints.

In 2006 CAERS began continued to be active with other community-based groups in monitoring the development of groups like the Aryan Guard in Calgary and Lethbridge, Alberta and Regina, Saskatchewan.

'''''Caveman Principles''''' is a book by [[Carl Rosier-Jones]]. It was published in the UK by [[Filament Publishing]] of London in November 2015. The book was designed and written to deliver a different look at stress in a simple and humorous format.

There are currently 3 Principles, all of which are based on the fact that we are evolved Cavemen. Carl's theories are based on the fact that stress is a result of a natural human response. Concentrating on the [[fight-or-flight|fight or flight principles]], he surmises that this once life saving response is now a debilitating condition that cause us the daily stress of today. He uses theories as far back as [[Socrates]] to describe his communication tool, The Caveman Tribal sorter, [[personality-psychology|personality profiling]].

His principles are:

1st principle - is that everyone has a stress mammoth.

2nd principle - is that communication is key.

3rd principle - is that personal change is always needed.

The use of characters and the simplicity in the writing of the book has meant that it is being implemented into schools and teaching methods across the UK.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5223">'''Changzhou School of Thought''' 常州學派, the [[Changzhou]]-centered influential school of scholarship of the late Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1912). Scholars in this school are best known for their contribution to the [[New Text Confucianism]].

== Ming ==
[[Tang Shunzhi]] 唐順之 (1507-1560), the famous Ming mathematician and advocate of the ancient prose style, is considered the precursor of the school, since his work underlined importance of calendaric studies and mathematics in the [[Han learning|Han scholarship]]. Tang's argument for the "concrete studies" (''shixue''), as well as concern about diluting influence of the Buddhist and Daoist teachings on Confucianism of [[Wang Yangming]] became an important feature of the Changzhou intellectual framework.&lt;ref&gt;Elman,81-84.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tang Shunzhi was married to the grandmother of Zhuang Qiyuan (1559-1633), who compiled genealogies of Tangs and Zhuangs and claimed intellectual affinity to his predecessors. Qiyuan was influenced by Catholicism and [[Diego de Pantoja]] in particular, praising it as superior to Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhuang Qiyuan's sons kept the proclivity for practical knowledge: Zhuang Yinqi (''jinshi'' 1643) reissued a Ming book on children diseases, expanded with his own commentaries; Zhuang Yinghui (''jinshi'' 1628), with help of his brothers and sons, compiled a work on military history, extolling the "Confucian technical expertise".

== Qing ==
By the beginning of Qing, "Changzhou ''shixue''" was distinct from the [[Suzhou]] and [[Yangzhou]] traditions. However, its proponents were less interested in the Han learning, sticking to the [[Cheng-Zhu school|Cheng-Zhu]] orthodoxy as a reliable way to examination success.

In the middle of Qing, however, Changzhou had a plethora of Han learning scholars: [[Sun Xingyan]], [[Hong Liangji]] (1746–1809), [[Huang Jingyan]], [[Zhao Huaiyu]], [[Zhao Yi (scholar)|Zhao Yi]], Li Zhaole (1769-1849). The spread of Han learning was stimulated by [[Lu Wenchao]], a Hangzhou native, who moved to the Changzhou Longcheng Academy after being the head of the Jiyang Academy 暨陽書院 in the nearby Jiangyin in 1790-96.   

Zhuang Youke 莊有可, though largely unknown outside Changzhou,&lt;ref&gt;Elman, 194-5 states that he kept a number of teaching posts around the empire (Hefei and Zhili): it is unclear why this was not conductive to his scholarly popularity.&lt;/ref&gt; was recognized as a fine scholar dealing with the Old text/New text controversy. He was praised for mastery of the [[Shuowen]] dictionary and produced a number works on the ''Change classic'' and the ''Chunqiu''. His support to [[Yan Ruoqu]]-[[Hui Dong]]'s refutation of the Old Text ''Shangshu'' chapters stood in opposition to [[Zhuang Cunyu]]'s politics-bound view: Cunyu held that the ''renxin-Daoxin'' 人心 道心 notion of the "Councils of Yu the Great" chapter was crucially important for the imperial ethics, while the ''Han xue'' proponents, including Youke, interpreted it as a heterodox Buddhist influence on the Confucian doctrine.

Zhuang Cunyu (another prominent native of Changzhou), however, had an intellectual influence other than textological: he was an embodiment of the message that scholarly activity for a Confucian cannot be divorced from the political. Besides, he was the tutor of the younger generations of his lineage, including [[Zhuang Shuzu]] (cousin), [[Zhuang Shoujia]] and [[Liu Fenglu]] (grandsons). Shoujia was instrumental in publishing grandfather's works, restraining from popularization of his own writings.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the diplomatic and scholarly success of Liu Fenglu ([[:zh:劉逢祿|劉逢祿]], 1776—1829) in Beijing, the Changzhou school obtained national fame.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, 218-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he persuaded [[Ruan Yuan]] (1764-1849) to include a number of Changzhou-originated studies of classics into the ''Huang Qing jingjie'' 皇清经解.

The new intellectual generation in Chanzhou showed interest in paleography. Zhuang Shoujia, developing the ideas of Shuzu, authored the ''Shi shuming'' (Explication of writing and names), providing a history of ancient calligraphy with etymological (''xungu'') and paleographic (''wenzixue'') insights. Among the sources of his studies, Shoujia used remnants of the [[Xiping Stone Classics]] (Han dynasty). Shuzu's pupil [[Song Xiangfeng]] [[:zh:宋翔風|宋翔風]] (1776-1860) developed specialization in etymology, studying the [[Erya]] disctionary. However, quite in spirit of Zhuang Cunyu, he claimed: "In antiquity, those who studied the Classics did not drown in etymological glosses... Etymologists, if they reach farfetched explanations, and theorists, if they wind up in airy and distant studies, must both be criticized...  if the Tao is not put into effect, then the empire will not be ordered. The blame will fall on no one else but on scholars."&lt;ref&gt;Elman, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16488">'''Chronostasis''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] χρόνος, chrónos, "time" and στάσις, stásis, "standing") is a type of [[time perception|temporal illusion]] in which the first impression following the introduction of a new event or task-demand to the brain can appear to be extended in time.&lt;ref name="Hodinott"&gt;{{cite journal
|author1=Hodinott-Hill, Iona |author2=Thilo, Kai V. |author3=Cowey, Alan |author4=Walsh, Vincent | title = Auditory Chronostasis: Hanging on the Telephone

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, chronostasis temporarily occurs when fixating on a target stimulus, immediately following a [[saccade]] (i.e., quick [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]]). This elicits an overestimation in the temporal duration for which that target stimulus (i.e., postsaccadic stimulus) was perceived.  This effect can extend apparent durations by up to 500 ms and is consistent with the idea that the visual system models events prior to perception.&lt;ref name="Yarrow, Whiteley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yarrow|first=Kielan|author2=Whiteley, Louise |author3=Rothwell, John C. |author4= Haggard, Patrick |title=Spatial consequences of bridging the saccadic gap|journal=Vision Research|date=February 2006|volume=46|issue=4|pages=545–555|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2005.04.019 |pmid=16005489 |pmc=1343538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common occurrence of this illusion is known as the '''stopped-clock illusion''', where the second hand of an analog clock appears to stay still for longer than normal when looking at it for the first time.&lt;ref name=Knoll2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knoll|first=Jonas|author2=Morrone, M.

 | accessdate=2012-12-09 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

This illusion can also occur in the auditory and tactile domain. For instance, a study suggests that when someone listens to a ringing tone through a [[telephone]], while repetitively switching the receiver from one ear to the other, it causes the caller to overestimate the temporal duration between rings.&lt;ref name="Hodinott" /&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
Overall, chronostasis occurs as a result of a disconnection in the communication between visual [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]] and [[visual perception|perception]].  Sensation, information collected from our eyes, is usually directly interpreted to create our perception.  This perception is the collection of information that we consciously interpret from visual information.&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=E. Bruce|title=Sensation and perception|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0495601494|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, quick eye movements known as [[saccade]]s disrupt this flow of information. Because research into the neurology associated with visual processing is ongoing, there is renewed debate regarding the exact timing of changes in perception that lead to chronostasis.&lt;ref name=Knoll&gt;{{cite web|last=Knoll|first=Jonas|title=Spatio-temporal representations during eye movements and their neuronal correlates|url=http://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/diss/z2012/0935|format=Dissertation|date=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, below is a description of the general series of events that lead to chronostasis, using the example of a student looking up from his desk toward a clock in the classroom.

After his eyes collect light reflected off of the paper and this information is processed in his visual cortex, the student consciously perceives the paper in front of him.
#Following either a conscious decision or an involuntary perception of a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] in the periphery of the [[visual field]], the eyes intend to move to a second target of interest.&lt;ref name=Ibbotson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ibbotson|first=M.

This signal, known as an efferent cortical trigger or [[efference copy]], communicates to the brain that a saccade is about to begin.&lt;ref name=Yarrow&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yarrow|first=Kielan|author2=Johnson, Helen |author3=Haggard, Patrick |author4= Rothwell, John C. |title=Consistent Chronostasis Effects across Saccade Categories Imply a Subcortical Efferent Trigger|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=June 2004|volume=16|issue=5|pages=839–847|doi=10.1162/089892904970780 |pmid=15200711 |pmc=1266050}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bridgeman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bridgeman|first=Bruce|title=A review of the role of efference copy in sensory and oculomotor control systems|journal=Annals of Biomedical Engineering|year=1995|volume=23|issue=4|pages=409–422|doi=10.1007/BF02584441}}&lt;/ref&gt; During saccades, the sensitivity of visual information collected by the eyes is greatly reduced and, thus, any image collected during this saccade is very blurry.&lt;ref name=Knoll /&gt; In order to prevent the visual cortex from processing blurred sensory information, visual information collected by the eyes during a saccade is suppressed through a process known as [[saccadic masking]].

#Following the completion of the saccade, the eyes now focus on the second object of interest.  As soon as the saccade concludes, another efferent cortical trigger is sent from the eyes back to the brain.  This signal communicates to the brain that the saccade has concluded.  Prompted by this signal, the visual cortex once again resumes processing visual information.&lt;ref name=Yarrow /&gt; For the student, his eyes have now reached the clock and his brain's visual cortex begins to process information from his eyes.  However, this second efferent trigger also communicates to the brain that a period of time has been missing from perception.  To fill this gap in perception, visual information is processed in a manner known as neural antedating or backdating.&lt;ref name=Thilo /&gt; In this visual processing, the gap in perception is “filled in” with information gathered after the saccade.  For the student, the gap of time that occurred during the saccade is substituted with the processed image of the clock.  Thus, immediately following the saccade, the second hand of the clock appears to stop in place before moving.&lt;ref name=Eagleman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagleman|first=David M|title=Human time perception and its illusions|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|date=April 2008|volume=18|issue=2|pages=131–136|doi=10.1016/j.conb.2008.06.002|pmid=18639634|pmc=2866156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ChronostasisTimeline.gif|thumb|center|400px|A timeline of the sensation and perception of chronostasis within the context of a student in a classroom.  This depicts the mechanism of action described above.]]

In studying chronostasis and its underlying causes, there is potential bias in the experimental setting.  In many experiments, participants are asked to perform some sort of task corresponding to sensory stimuli.  This could cause the participants to anticipate stimuli, thus leading to bias.  Also, many mechanisms involved in chronostasis are complex and difficult to measure.  It is difficult for experimenters to observe the perceptive experiences of participants without "being inside their mind."&lt;ref name=Hodinott /&gt; Furthermore, experimenters normally do not have access to the neural circuitry and neurotransmitters located inside the braincases of their subjects.

==Modulating factors==
Because of its complexity, there are various characteristics of stimuli and physiological actions that can alter the way one experiences chronostasis.

===Saccadic amplitude===
The greater the amplitude (or duration) of a saccade, the more severe the resulting overestimation.  The further the student in the above example's eyes must travel in order to reach the clock, the more dramatic his perception of chronostasis.&lt;ref name=Thilo /&gt;  This connection supports the assertion that overestimation occurs in order to fill in the length of time omitted by [[saccadic masking]].  This would mean that, if the saccade lasted for a longer period of time, there would be more time that needed to be filled in with overestimation.&lt;ref name=Nobre&gt;{{cite book|last=Nobre|first=Anna C.|title=Attention and time|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-956345-6|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attention redirection===
When shifting focus from one object to a second object, the saccadic movement of one's eyes is also accompanied by a conscious shift of [[attention]].  In the context of the stopped clock illusion, not only do your eyes move, but you also shift your attention to the clock.  This led researchers to question whether the movement of the eyes or simply the shift of the observer's attention towards the second stimulus initiated saccadic masking.  Experiments in which subjects diverted only their attention without moving their eyes revealed that the redirection of attention alone was not enough to initiate chronostasis.&lt;ref name=Thilo /&gt;  This suggests that attention is not the time marker used when perception is filled back in.  Rather, the physical movement of the eyes themselves serves as this critical marker.  However, this relationship between attention and perception in the context of chronostasis is often difficult to measure and may be biased in a laboratory setting.  Because subjects may be biased as they are instructed to perform actions or to redirect their attention, the concept of attention serving as a critical time marker for chronostasis may not be entirely dismissed.&lt;ref name=Nobre /&gt;

===Spatial continuity===
Following investigation, one may wonder if chronostasis still occurs if the saccadic target is moving.  In other words, would you still experience chronostasis if the clock you looked at were moving?  Through experimentation, researchers found that the occurrence of chronostasis in the presence of a moving stimulus was dependent on the awareness of the subject.  If the subject were aware that the saccadic target was moving, they would not experience chronostasis.  Conversely, if the subject were not aware of the saccadic target's movement, they did experience chronostasis.  This is likely because antedating does not occur in the case of a consciously moving target.  If, after the saccade, the eye correctly falls on the target, the brain assumes this target has been at this location throughout the saccade.  If the target changes position during the saccade, the interruption of spatial continuity makes the target appear novel.&lt;ref name=Thilo /&gt;

===Stimulus properties===
Properties of stimuli themselves have shown to have significant effects on the occurrence of chronostasis.  In particular, the frequency and pattern of stimuli affect the observer's perception of chronostasis.  In regard to frequency, the occurrence of many, similar events can exaggerate duration overestimation and makes the effects of chronostasis more severe.  In regard to repetition, repetitive stimuli appear to be of shorter subjective duration than novel stimuli.&lt;ref name=Eagleman /&gt; This is due to neural suppression within the cortex.  Investigation using various imaging techniques has shown that repetitive firing of the same cortical neurons cause them to be suppressed over time.&lt;ref name=Verhoef&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verhoef|first=B.-E.|author2=Kayaert, G. |author3=Franko, E. |author4=Vangeneugden, J. |author5= Vogels, R. |title=Stimulus Similarity-Contingent Neural Adaptation Can Be Time and Cortical Area Dependent|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|date=15 October 2008|volume=28|issue=42|pages=10631–10640|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3333-08.2008 |pmid=18923039}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This occurs as a form of [[neural adaptation]].

===Sensory domain===
The occurrence of chronostasis extends beyond the visual domain into the [[Auditory system|auditory]] and [[Touch|tactile]] domains.&lt;ref name=Nijhawan&gt;{{cite book|last=Nijhawan|first=Romi|title=Space and Time in Perception and Action|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-86318-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the auditory domain, chronostasis and duration overestimation occur when observing auditory stimuli.  One common example is a frequent occurrence when making telephone calls.  If, while listening to the phone's dial tone, research subjects move the phone from one ear to the other, the length of time between rings appears longer.&lt;ref name=Hodinott /&gt; In the tactile domain, chronostasis has persisted in research subjects as they reach for and grasp objects.  After grasping a new object, subjects overestimate the time in which their hand has been in contact with this object.&lt;ref name="Yarrow, Rothwell" /&gt;  In other experiments, subjects turning a light on with a button were conditioned to experience the light before the button press. This suggests that, much in the same way subjects overestimate the duration of the second hand as they watch it, they may also overestimate the duration of auditory and tactile stimuli.  This has led researchers to investigate the possibility that a common timing mechanism or temporal duration scheme is used for [[time perception|temporal perception]] of stimuli across a variety of sensory domains.&lt;ref name=Eagleman /&gt;

{{Emotion}}
[[File:Boilly-Point-de-Convention-ca1797.jpg|thumb|A painting by [[Louis-Léopold Boilly]] (ca. 1797).&lt;br&gt;The woman has been interpreted as a [[prostitute]] (who is '''disdaining''' the inadequate coin proffered by the fashionable gentleman getting his shoes shined at left).]]

'''Contempt''', not classified among [[Paul Ekman]]'s six [[Emotion#Basic emotions|basic emotions]] of [[anger]], [[disgust]], [[fear]], [[happiness]], [[sadness]], and [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]], is a mixture of [[disgust]] and [[anger]].&lt;ref&gt;TenHouten, W.D. (2007). ''General Theory of Emotions and Social Life''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} The word originated in 1393, from the [[Latin]] word ''contemptus'' meaning "scorn". It is the [[past participle]] of ''contemnere'' and from ''com''- intensive prefix + ''temnere'' "to slight, scorn". The origin is uncertain. ''Contemptuous'' appeared in 1529.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Contempt. (n.d.) |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=April 20, 2008 | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/contempt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert C. Solomon]] places contempt on the same continuum as [[resentment]] and anger, and he argues that the differences between the three are that [[resentment]] is anger directed toward a higher-status individual; [[anger]] is directed toward an equal-status individual; and contempt is anger directed toward a lower-status individual.&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;Solomon R.C.

==Cultural context==
[[File:PSM V36 D704 Facial expression of contempt.jpg|thumb|Facial expression of contempt]]
[[Paul Ekman|Ekman]] and [[Friesen]] (1986) identified a specific [[facial expression]] that observers in ten different cultures, both Western and non-Western, agreed signaled contempt. In this study, citizens of West Sumatra, Indonesia, were given photos of American, Japanese, and Indonesian peoples. Their ability to classify some facial expressions as contempt versus the primary emotions of anger, disgust, happiness, sadness, fear, or surprise showed that across cultures, general contempt is universally understood (with level of agreement equating to 75%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ekman | first1 = P | last2 = Heider | first2 = K.G. | year = 1988 | title = The Universality of Contempt Expression: A Replication | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 303–308 | doi=10.1007/bf00993116}}&lt;/ref&gt; “An expression in which the corner of the lip is tightened and raised slightly on one side of the face (or much more strongly on one side than the other) signaled contempt.” This study showed that contempt, as well as the outward expression of contempt, can be pointed out across Western and Non-Western peoples when contrasted with other primary emotions.

==Characteristics==
[[Paul Ekman]], a widely recognized psychologist, found six emotions that were universally recognized: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise. Findings on contempt are less clear, though there is at least some preliminary evidence that this emotion and its expression are universally recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Ekman, P. &amp; Friesen, W. V (1969). The repertoire of nonverbal behavior: Categories, origins, usage, and encoding. Semiotica, 1, 49–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s Ekman proposed an expanded list of emotions, this time including contempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ekman|last2=Heider|title=The Universality of a Contempt Expression: A Replication|url=https://www.paulekman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/The-Universality-Of-A-Contempt-Expression-A-Replication.pdf|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume= 12| issue =  3|doi=10.1007/bf00993116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining features==
Contempt has five features.&lt;ref name="Bell2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1527-2001.2005.tb00537.x| title = A Woman's Scorn: Toward a Feminist Defense of Contempt as a Moral Emotion| year = 2005| last1 = Bell | first1 = M. | journal = Hypatia| volume = 20| issue = 4| pages = 80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contempt requires a judgment concerning the appearance or standing of the object of contempt.  In particular, contempt involves the judgment that, because of some moral or personal failing or defect, the contemned person has compromised his or her standing ''vis-à-vis'' an interpersonal standard that the contemptor treats as important.  This may have not been done deliberately but by a lack of [[social status|status]]. This lack of status may cause the contemptuous to classify the object of contempt as utterly worthless, or as not fully meeting a particular interpersonal standard. Therefore, contempt is a response to a perceived failure to meet an interpersonal standard. Contempt is also a particular way of regarding or attending to the object of contempt, and this form of regard has an unpleasant [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] element. However, contempt may be experienced as a highly visceral emotion similar to disgust, or as cool disregard.
[[File:Contempt facial expression.jpg|thumb|Facial expression showing subtle contempt|alt=]]
Contempt has a certain comparative element. In [[David Hume]]'s studies of contempt, he suggests that contempt essentially requires apprehending the “bad qualities” of someone “as they really are” while simultaneously making a comparison between this person and ourselves. Because of this reflexive element, contempt also involves what we might term a “positive self-feeling” of the contemptuous. A characteristic of contempt is the psychological withdrawal or distance one typically feels regarding the object of one’s contempt. This psychological distancing is an essential way of expressing one’s nonidentification with the object of one’s contempt and it precludes sympathetic identification with the object of contempt. (Hume, 2002, 251) Contempt for a person involves a way of negatively and comparatively regarding or attending to someone who has not fully lived up to an interpersonal standard that the person extending contempt thinks is important.  This form of regard constitutes a psychological withdrawal from the object of contempt.&lt;ref name="Bell2005" /&gt;

==Virtues==
Contempt can be useful to being a functioning member of the moral community. An ethics of contempt provides a much larger breadth of answers than other competing systems of ethics, whether they be based on ethics of actions (judging actions by their rightness or wrongness) or ethics of feelings (e.g., ethics of resentment). By feeling contempt for those things which are found to be unethical, immoral, or morally unsavory, one can both show that they are bad and remove them from the moral community.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, M. (2013). ''Hard Feelings: The Moral Psychology of Contempt.'' Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0199794146}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==Response==
[[File:Contempt.jpg|thumb|Facial expression showing obvious contempt]]
The main response of contempt lies within “publicized expression of low regard for the objects held in contempt” (Miller, C.H., 2005). By this reasoning, a person holding contempt would not have the urge to openly confront the person with whom they are at odds, nor would they themselves try to remove the object of contempt; rather, one who holds contempt would have the tendency to hold the view that others should remove the object of contempt, or hold the view that the object of contempt should remove itself. So while one would make their feelings known to others, the person with contempt would not necessarily want to directly deal with the situation at hand. One who is experiencing contempt would exhibit negative affective behaviors that may be labeled as “cold” – this simply meaning that one who is experiencing the emotion of contempt would tend to [[social alienation|alienate]] those responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, C. H. (2035). How dare you! A measure of indignation. Manuscript in preparation, University of Oklahoma.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==Contempt in relationships==
===Gender differences===
Men and women act differently when displaying contempt in same-sex relationships. Not only do girls engage in more non-verbal forms of social aggression than boys do, girls dissembled more than boys do, speaking nicely but making mean faces. In the research provided by Underwood (2004) in their laboratory observation studies where they watch girls and boys in an identical social context in which best friends respond to a provoking newcomer, gender differences emerge not for the verbal behaviours, but for the nonverbal expressions of disdain and contempt (which are so glaring that they were observed with high degrees of inter-coder reliability by both women and men, kappa’s exceeding .8; Underwood et al., 2003).&lt;ref name="Underwood, M. K. 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0959353504044637| title = III. Glares of Contempt, Eye Rolls of Disgust and Turning Away to Exclude:         Non-Verbal Forms of Social Aggression among Girls| year = 2004| last1 = Underwood | first1 = M. K.| journal = Feminism &amp; Psychology| volume = 14| issue = 3| pages = 371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several reasons why girls can be especially prone to conveying anger and contempt by nonverbal forms of social exclusion. One reason may be that girls are socialized from infancy onward to be overtly nice and conciliatory and do so to avoid conflict whenever possible, for fear of being [[social rejection|excluded from relationships]], disliked, or punished (for reviews, see Brown and Gilligan, 1993; Underwood, 2003; Zahn-Waxler, 2000). Non-verbal forms of social exclusion may be a highly effective way to harm someone with relatively few social consequences; the hurtful act is fleeting, can often be executed behind the victim’s back and outside of the watchful eyes of adults, and, even if caught, mean faces are typically not punished. Second, girls may hurt one another via non-verbal expressions of exclusion or disdain because girls and women may gaze at others more for reasons related to their lower social status, so as to learn as much as possible about others’ needs and desires (see LaFrance, 2002, for a discussion of ‘Smile boycotts and other body politics’, p.&amp;nbsp;319). Because girls and women gaze at others often, perhaps mean glares are more effective as a means of wielding power. Third, non-verbal forms of social exclusion may be powerful for girls because their relationships involve high levels of intimacy and self-disclosure (see Buhrmester and Prager, 1995, for a review), thus even subtle indicators of exclusion are threatening. Fourth, non-verbal forms of social exclusion may be powerful for girls because although they fiercely desire and defend popularity with other girls, they dread being labelled as ‘stuck up’ (Merten, 1997).&lt;ref name="Underwood, M. K. 2004"/&gt;

===Legal responses===
In 2003, the [[Palo Alto]] City Council defeated a resolution that would have discouraged elected officials from facial expressions conveying contempt at public meetings; this was proposed because council members were so weary of colleagues intimidating one another by these subtle but rude facial expressions.&lt;ref&gt;"City Council Allows Frowning", ''Daily Southtown'', 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
Research demonstrates how [[childhood abuse]] ties into maladaptive [[Interpersonal communication|communication]] dynamics consisting of contempt-laden conflict and [[emotional withdrawal]]. These findings are important because maladaptive marital communication may be one mechanism by which traumatic childhood experiences translate into poor adult relationship quality.

Forms of verbal aggression, such as contempt, belligerence, and defensiveness, are associated with destructive, hostile patterns of conflict resolution ( [Gottman et al., 1998] and [Straus, 1979]). Couples who use such communication styles are more likely to have higher levels of marital distress (Roberts, 2000), lower levels of marital satisfaction (Holman and Jarvis, 2003), and lower levels of marital stability ([Gottman et al., 1998], [Holman and Jarvis, 2003] and [DeMaris, 2000]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2010.05.003| title = Fiery wives and icy husbands: Pre-marital counseling and covenant marriage as buffers against effects of childhood abuse on gendered marital communication?| year = 2010| last1 = Krivickas | first1 = K.

Gottman (1999) identified several behaviors that are particularly indicative of distress in relationships. One series of behaviors, which he termed the "four horsemen," includes a cascading of responses such as expressing criticism, defensiveness, contempt, [[sarcasm]], [[hostility]], and withdrawal, the combination of which indicate a critical state of marriage dissolution.&lt;ref name="Cornelius, T. 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10896-010-9305-9| title = Self-Reported Communication Variables and Dating Violence: Using Gottman's Marital Communication Conceptualization| year = 2010| last1 = Cornelius | first1 = T. L. | last2 = Shorey | first2 = R. C. | last3 = Beebe | first3 = S. M. | journal = Journal of Family Violence| volume = 25| issue = 4| pages = 439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carstensen, Gottman, and Levenson (1995) found that “Negative emotional behavior, such as expressed anger, sadness, contempt, and other negative emotions, appears to be the best discriminator between satisfied and dissatisfied marriages”. Carstensen, Gottman, and Levenson (1995) also discovered that “In terms of speaker behaviors, wives were coded as showing more total emotion, negative emotion, anger, joy, contempt, whining, and sadness.” This supports the stereotype that women express more emotion than men both in general and in relationships. It also supports the idea that men are less expressive than women and tend to be more defensive minded in conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.10.1.140| title = Emotional behavior in long-term marriage| year = 1995| last1 = Carstensen | first1 = L. L. | last2 = Gottman | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Levenson | first3 = R. W. | journal = Psychology and Aging| volume = 10| pages = 140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six short self-report measures were used to assess several component communication skills (Gottman 1999). Specifically, the questionnaires assessed Repair Attempts, Accepting Influence, Harsh Start-Up, Flooding, Gridlock, and the Four Horsemen. These six measures were chosen because they were of theoretical and clinical interest to the authors, incorporated both adaptive and maladaptive communication behaviors, and included those aspects of couple communication considered by many to be most toxic, including withdrawal and contempt (Gottman 1999; Gottman et al. 1998; Johnson 2003).&lt;ref name="Cornelius, T. 2010"/&gt;

Finally, the Four Horsemen create a cascading sequence of responses in which one partner expresses criticism and the other partner responds with defensiveness, causing the first partner to react to the defensiveness with contempt, sarcasm, and/or hostility with their partner, eventually withdrawing from, or stonewalling, the conversation. This cascading negative sequence which occurs as a repetitive, interlocking pattern is believed to signify a critical end-stage process of relationship dissolution, representing a final common causal pathway to relationship dissolution (see Gottman 1994).&lt;ref name="Cornelius, T. 2010"/&gt;

In the book Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, author Malcolm Gladwell discusses John Gottman's theories of how to predict which couples will stay married. Gottman's theory states that there are four major emotional reactions that are destructive to a marriage: defensiveness, stonewalling, criticism, and contempt. Among these four, Gottman considers contempt the most destructive of them all.&lt;ref name="Gladwell" /&gt;

For all other forms of aggression the Four Horsemen emerged as significant predictors of classification, which is expected given that this construct includes very negative, contemptuous behaviors. This is consistent with marital research, which contends that these communication behaviors are highly toxic, and erode relationship satisfaction (Cornelius et al. 2007; Gottman 1999).&lt;ref name="Cornelius, T. 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladwell"&gt;{{cite book

In [[statistical graphics]] and [[scientific visualization]], the '''contour boxplot'''&lt;ref name=Whitaker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitaker|first=Ross T.|author2=Mahsa Mirzargar |author3=Robert M. Kirby |title=Contour Boxplots: A Method for Characterizing Uncertainty in Feature Sets from Simulation Ensembles|journal=IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (IEEE Visualization Issue)|volume=19|number=12|pages=2713–2722|year=2013|doi=10.1109/TVCG.2013.143|pmid=24051838}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an exploratory tool that has been proposed for visualizing ensembles of feature-sets determined by a threshold on some scalar function (e.g. level-sets, isocontours). Analogous to the classical boxplot and considered an expansion of the concepts defining [[functional boxplot]],&lt;ref name=Hyndman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyndman|first=Rob J.|author2=Han Lin|title=Rainbow Plots, Bagplots, and Boxplots for Functional Data|journal=Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics|year=2010|volume=19|issue=1|pages=29–45|doi=10.1198/jcgs.2009.08158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sun&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=Y.|author2=M.G.

To construct a contour boxplot, data ordering is the first step. In [[functional data analysis]], each observation is a real function, therefore data ordering is different from the classical boxplot where scalar data are simply ordered from the smallest sample value to the largest. More generally, data depth, gives a center-outward ordering of data points, and thereby provides a mechanism for constructing rank statistics of various kinds of multidimensional data. For instance, functional data examples can be ordered using the method of band depth or a modified band depth. In contour data analysis, each observation is a feature-set (a subset of the domain), and therefore not a function. Thus, the notion of band depth and modified band depth is further extended to accommodate features that can be expressed as sets but not necessarily as functions. Contour band depth allows for ordering feature-set data from the center outwards and, thus, introduces a measure to define functional quantiles and the centrality or outlyingness of an observation. Having the ranks of feature-set data, the contour boxplot is a natural extension of the classical boxplot which in special cases reduces back to the traditional functional boxplot.

== Set/contour band depth ==

Set band depth (introduced in &lt;ref name=Whitaker /&gt;), denoted as sBD, is a method for establishing a center-outward ordering of a collection of sets. As with other band depth, data ordering methods, set band depth, computes the probability of whether a sample lies in the band formed by ''j'' other samples from the distribution. We say that a set ''S''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''E'' is an element of the band of a collection of ''j'' other sets ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''E'' if it is bounded by their union and intersection. That is:

: &lt;math&gt; S\in sB(S_1,\ldots,S_j) \Longleftrightarrow \bigcap_{k=1}^j S_k \subset S\subset \bigcup_{k=1}^j S_k. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The set band depth is the sum of probabilities of lying in bands formed by different numbers of samples (2,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''J'').

: &lt;math&gt; sBD_J(S)=\sum_{j=2}^JP\left[S\in sB(S_1,\ldots,S_j\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

Set band depth is shown to be a generalization of function band depth. Set band depth has a modified form that is derived from a relaxed form of subset, which requires only a percentage of a set to be included in another.

Contour band depth (cBD) is a direct application of sBD, where the sets are derived from thresholded input functions, ''F''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''q''. In this way, an ensemble of scalar input functions and a threshold value, gives rise to a collection of contours, and sorting cBD gives a data-depth ordering (highest-to-lowest probability gives greatest-to-smallest depth) of those contours. By relying on the set formulation, contour boxplots avoid any explicit correspondence of points on different contours.

== Contour boxplot construction ==

In the classical boxplot, the box itself represents the middle 50% of the data. Since the data ordering in the contour boxplot is from the center outwards, the 50% central region is defined by the band delimited by the 50% of deepest, or the most central observations. The border of the 50% central region is defined as the envelope representing the box in a classical boxplot. Thus, this 50% central region is the analog to the [[interquartile range]] (IQR) and gives a useful indication of the spread of the central 50% of the curves. This is a robust range for interpretation because the 50% central region is not affected by outliers or extreme values, and gives a less biased visualization of the curves' spread. The observation in the box indicates the [[median]], or the most central observation which is also a robust statistic to measure centrality.

The "whiskers" of the boxplot are the vertical lines of the plot extending from the box and indicating the maximum envelope of the dataset except the outliers. In contour boxplots, this is formed by considering the difference of the union and intersection formed by all non-outlying samples. Outliers are determined as having a cBD value that is less than some multiplier (less than one) times the cBD of the 50% ranked samples.

== Examples ==

The following example is an ensemble of data from 2D incompressible Navier–Stokes simulation consisting of 40 members, where each ensemble member is a simulation with Reynolds number and inlet velocity chosen randomly. The inlet velocity values are randomly drawn from a normal distribution with mean value of 1 and standard deviation of ±0.01 (in non-dimensionalized units); likewise, Reynolds numbers are generated from a normal distribution with mean value of 130 and standard deviation of ±3.

The example below is from an ensemble of publicly available data from the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) [1]. The ensemble data are formed through different runs of a simulation model with different perturbations of the initial conditions to account for the errors in the initial conditions and/or model parameterizations. The ensemble consists of isocontours of the temperature field (isovalue −15C) at 500mb in altitude.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11930">'''Dickinson Sargeant Miller''' (October 7, 1868 &amp;ndash; November 13, 1963) worked with many world-renowned philosophers, including [[William James]], [[George Santayana]], [[John Dewey]], [[Edmund Husserl]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Loyd Easton, ''Dickinson Miller: Philosophical Analysis and Human Welfare", Reidel, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Miller received the A.B. degree in 1889 under George Fullerton at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He studied psychology under [[G. Stanley Hall]] at [[Clark University]] for a year, and then went to [[Harvard]] where he was a graduate student under [[William James]], G. H. Palmer, [[Josiah Royce]], and Santayana. He received the A.M. from Harvard in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Loyd Easton, ''Dickinson Miller: Philosophical Analysis and Human Welfare", p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

He then spent a year in Germany studying at Berlin and Halle under [[Max Dessoir]], [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]], and [[Friedrich Paulsen]], earning his Ph.D. with a dissertation on ''Das Wesen der Erkenntnis und des Irrthums'', which was published as "The Meaning of Truth and Error" in ''The Philosophical Review'' in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

This article led James to abandon Royce's solution of the knowledge problem in terms of an absolute mind. James recommended Miller to a post at [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1893, where he was a close friend of [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, Miller became a strong critic of James's famous arguments in ''The Will to Believe'' that the beneficial effects of a belief somehow increased its "truth."  His critical article was "The Will to Believe and the Duty to Doubt."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Barton Perry, ''The Thought and Character of William James'', vol. 2, p.240&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller left Bryn Mawr that year to become an instructor of philosophy at Harvard, where he had a strong and productive collaboration with James.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; James referred to Miller as "my most penetrating critic and intimate enemy." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/hobart/ "R. E. Hobart" on Information Philosopher]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, Miller left Harvard to be a lecturer in philosophy at Columbia and professor in 1911. There he worked with [[Arthur O. Lovejoy]] and John Dewey.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller retired from academic work after two years at Smith College (1926-26) and went into a "European retirement." &lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; He visited Rome at first and then alternated between Florence and Vienna, where he made contact with the "Vienna Circle" of philosophers, including [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Otto Neurath]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Herbert Feigl]], and others.

Miller challenged a basic principle of the Circle that "no sentence can be admitted to philosophical thought as having a meaning unless it is verifiable in experience." Such a principle, he argued "cuts the ground from under its own feet" because a sentence has to already have meaning before you can apply the test.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vienna he met with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] who was then loosely associated with the Vienna Circle.

==Free will as involving determination==
In 1934, as Miller left to return for America, he published a landmark article in ''Mind'' under the pseudonym [[R. E. Hobart]],.&lt;ref&gt;R. E. Hobart, Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It" ''Mind'', Vol XLIII, No. 169, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

He analyzed the relationship between "could" and "can" in the sense of choosing to do otherwise in the same circumstances and he claimed that the controversy of free will ''versus'' determinism was a waste of energy over a false antithesis. At least some determinism is not a problem for free will but a feature.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

The article was titled "Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It," but it is widely misquoted as "Involving [[Determinism]]." His biographer, Loyd Easton, correctly describes it as "an acute example of 'soft determinism' or 'reconciliationism'."&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of "determinism" ''versus'' free will that [[William James]] was concerned about was the strict causal determines that is better called [[predeterminism]] where every event is determined in a causal chain back to the beginning of time, and there is "but one possible future," as James put it.&lt;ref&gt;James, William. 1884. The Dilemma of Determinism, Unitarian Review, vol.XXII, p.193. Reprinted in The Will to Believe, Dover Publications, 1956, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;

Far from "reconciling" free will with this kind of determinism, as [[David Hume]] said that he had done in his "reconciling project,",&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding'', VIII, 1, §72&lt;/ref&gt; James proposed the first two-stage model of free will that denies [[predeterminism]] and accepts absolute [[Chance (philosophy)|chance]] as necessary for the generation of [[Alternative Possibilities|alternative possibilities]], which are the source of "ambiguous futures" selected by the determination, but not predetermination, of the will.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Doyle, "Jamesian Free Will: The Two-Stage Model of William James," ''William James Studies'', April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller/Hobart dissents from James's new idea about free will, constructing a distinctive  reconciling compatibilism that dispenses with any requirement for chance in the analysis of what persons' abilities to perform alternate acts.  Rather than analyzing causality as Hume did, Hobart focuses on moral evaluation of acts and character.

==The ''Mind'' article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://philpapers.org/archive/HOBFWA.pdf|title = Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It|date = 24 March 2015|accessdate = 24 March 2015 |website = Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It|publisher = |last = Hobart|first = R.E.|type = PDF|orig-year = 1934|publication-date = January 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
Writing about six years after the discovery of [[quantum indeterminacy]], Hobart explicitly does not endorse strict logical or physical [[determinism]], and he explicitly does endorse the existence of [[Alternative Possibilities|alternative possibilities]], i.e., that we can do otherwise in the same circumstances.  Hobart does not, however, attribute those possibilities to absolute chance.

He says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    I am not maintaining that determinism is true; only that it is true in so far as we have free will.  ... it is not here affirmed that there are no small exceptions, no slight undetermined swervings, no ingredient of absolute chance. All that is here said is that such absence of determination, if and so far as it exists, is no gain to freedom, but sheer loss of it&lt;ref&gt;''Mind'', Vol XLIII, No. 169, January, 1934, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    "We say," I can will this or I can will that, whichever I choose ". Two courses of action present themselves to my mind. I think of their consequences, I look on this picture and on that, one of them commends itself more than the other, and I will an act that brings it about. I knew that I could choose either. That means that I had the power to choose either.&lt;ref&gt;''Mind'', p.8&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
We can contrast Hobart with William James's claim that there are ambiguous futures. The  second paragraph is not inconsistent with the two-stage model of free will - first "free" courses of action present themselves, then an adequately determined "will" chooses between them, in a temporal sequence.  However, the first paragraph denies that any randomness in the decision process, including the presentation of options, adds to freedom.

Hobart refers to [[G. E. Moore]]'s idea that one could have done otherwise - "if" one had chosen otherwise. But Hobart views the "if" as redundant, and therefore licenses the claim that we could have done otherwise, full stop.
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    Thus it is true, after the act of will, that I could have willed otherwise. It is most natural to add, "if I had wanted to"; but the addition is not required. The point is the meaning of "could". I could have willed whichever way I pleased. I had the power to will otherwise, there was nothing to prevent my doing so, and I should have done so if I had wanted.&lt;ref&gt;''Mind'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hobart finds fault with the indeterminist's position, but he gives the typical overstatement by a determinist critic, that any chance will be the direct cause of our actions, which of course would clearly be a loss of freedom and responsibility

&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Indeterminism maintains that we need not be impelled to action by our wishes, that our active will need not be determined by them. Motives "incline without necessitating". We choose amongst the ideas of action before us, but need not choose solely according to the attraction of desire, in however wide a sense that word is used. Our inmost self may rise up in its autonomy and moral dignity, independently of motives, and register its sovereign decree.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    Now, in so far as this "interposition of the self" is undetermined, the act is not its act, it does not issue from any concrete continuing self; it is born at the moment, of nothing, hence it expresses no quality; it bursts into being from no source. (p.6)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    In proportion as an act of volition starts of itself without cause it is exactly, so far as the freedom of the individual is concerned, as if it had been thrown into his mind from without — "suggested" to him — by a freakish demon. It is exactly like it in this respect, that in neither case does the volition arise from what the man is, cares for or feels allegiance to; it does not come out of him. In proportion as it is undetermined, it is just as if his legs should suddenly spring up and carry him off where he did not prefer to go. Far from constituting freedom, that would mean, in the exact measure in which it took place, the loss of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;''Mind'', p.7&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Possibly Hobart has William James in mind as "the indeterminist." However, the only inderminist philosopher named in the article is Eddington. James would not have denied that our will is an act of determination, consistent with, and in some sense "caused by" our character and values, our habits, and our current feelings and desires. He simply wanted chance to provide alternative possibilities for actions and a break in the causal chain of [[strict determinism (philosophy)|strict determinism]].

Hobart sees no need for such chance, and no addition to freedom to be had by it. The freedom we take ourselves to have is fully consistent with thorough-going determinism regarding human action.
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    In daily life we are all determinists, just as we are all libertarians. We are constantly attributing behaviour to the character, the temperament, the peculiarities of the person and expecting him to behave in certain fashions. The very words of our daily converse, as we have so amply observed, are full of determinism. And we see nothing inconsistent in being aware at the same time that he is free in choosing his course, as we know ourselves to be.&lt;ref&gt;''Mind'', p.21&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5667">'''Ecological imperialism''' is the theory advanced first by Alfred Crosby that European settlers were successful in colonization of other regions because of their accidental or deliberate introduction of animals, plants, and disease leading to major shifts in the ecology of the colonized areas and to population collapses in the endemic peoples. The many [[pathogen]]s they carried with them adversely affected the [[native populations]] of North America, Australia, and Africa, and were far more destructive than weaponry: it is estimated that disease wiped out up to 90 percent of indigenous people in some locations.&lt;ref&gt;D. N. Cook, Demographic Collapse: Indian Peru 1520-1620 (Cambridge, 1981), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Cortes and the Aztecs==
In the early 16th century, Spanish conquistador [[Hernán Cortés]] led an expedition to what is now Mexico, which resulted in the total destruction of the [[Aztec Empire]] within just two years (February 1519 – August 1521). Notwithstanding the Europeans' superior weaponry and [[Horses]], it is believed {{by who?|date=December 2016}} that the arrival of [[smallpox]] in the Americas in 1520 weakened the resistance the Aztecs people were able to mount.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

=="The New World"==
In 1607, English settlers arrived in North America and established the [[Jamestown colony]] in Virginia. Though at first it seemed the colonists would not survive the harsh conditions of the [[New World]], ultimately it was the natives who could not survive the diseases of the Old World. "The colonizers brought along plants and animals new to the Americas, some by design and others by accident. Determined to farm in a European manner, the colonists introduced their domesticated livestock—honeybees, pigs, horses, mules, sheep, and cattle—and their domesticated plants, including wheat, barley, rye, oats, grasses, and grapevines. But the colonists also inadvertently carried pathogens, weeds, and rats."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Taylor, American Colonies (Penguin Books: 2002), 280-300.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of these foreign species upset the balance of native species and severely hurt the way of life of the native population. 

The first major smallpox outbreak among natives was between 1616 and 1619 in Massachusetts. Native Americans had never seen a disease like this, and it wiped out entire settlements in nations such as the [[Abenaki]], the [[Pawtucket tribe|Pawtucket]], and the [[Wampanoag]]. "By wiping out the Indians, smallpox helped the colonists help themselves to land and resources formerly controlled by unfriendly native people. The Europeans could and did colonize virtually unchallenged in some areas." In 1633 there was another devastating epidemic. William Bradford, governor of the Plymouth Colony, observed that: "They lye on their hard matts, ye pox breaking and muttering, and running one into another, their skin cleaving (by reason thereof) to the matts they lye on; when they turn them, a whole side with flea off at once...and they will be all of a gore blood, most fearful to behold. Then being very sore, what with cold and other distempers, they dye like rotten sheep."&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie True Peters, Epidemic! Smallpox in the New World (Benchmark Books, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Syphilis was also extremely devastating, and ran rampant when brought back to the Old World.

==Fur trade==
The fur trade was as detrimental to the survival of native people as it was imperative to the success of settlers due the high European demand. Trappers employed natives because of their knowledge of the terrain and wildlife, putting natives with no immunity to European diseases into close contact with Europeans.

The fur trade also upset the ecological balance of North America. "Restraint wasn't a hallmark of the fur trade. In 1822, in the north western regions of the country alone, the Hudson's Bay Company stockpiled 1500 fox skins, a paltry number compared with the 106,000 beaver skins, but too many none the less. The fur traders had miscalculated. As predators, they had failed to adapt to their prey, and their prey, in turn, retaliated with denial. Of course, the red fox didn't render himself extinct. His numbers merely shrank.".&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Kirsch, What Species of Creatures (New Star Books: 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19565">'''Endre Tot''' (Endre TÓT) born in [[Sümeg]], [[Hungary]],1937 is a Hungarian artist who lives and works in [[Cologne]], Germany.

Tot participated in the [[Fluxus]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ben-vautier.com/2007/2007.php3?id_sujet=flux fluxus]&lt;/ref&gt; movement and is well known for his [[Mail art]] projects, the use of xerox copies and usage of rubber stamps with clear [[Conceptual art|conceptual]] text declarations. In some of them Tot declares: "We are glad if we are happy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hundertmark-gallery.com/artist-endre-tot.0.html Endré Tot]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 he shows "Who's Afraid of Nothing? Absent images" at [[Museum Ludwig]], Cologne, a continuation of a project called "Nothing is not nothing".

==The 60s – Experiments in Informel==
He studied at the Mural Department of the Hungarian College of Arts and Crafts from 1959 till 1965. He started to make informel paintings, an absolute novelty in Hungary, in the early 60s followed shortly by collages and works executed in the spirit of Pop Art and Minimal Art. He became attached in the mid-60s to a leading but neglected Avant-Garde painter, Dezső Korniss who highly appreciated his pioneering informel ventures. In 1968 and 1969 he joined his young Neo-Avant-Garde colleagues named collectively the Iparterv Group of Artists at two scandalous exhibitions heavily criticised by officialdom. A retrospective of his early works was staged at the Budapest Kiscelli Museum in 1989, his early pencil and ink drawings were shown at Székesfehérvár’s King Stephen Museum in 2003, while a comprehensive exhibition of his early works entitled „Early Works – from painted to unpainted pictures” at the Szombathely Gallery in 2004 presented most of his important works executed before his „My Unpainted Canvasses” (1970). After the political turn of 1989-1990 many of his major works executed back in the 60s were acquired by important Hungarian museums.

==The 70s – The Beginnings of Concept Art==
In 1970-71 he broke radically with painting and has since been pre-occupied with Concept Art. „Tót may well have possessed the most phenomenal painter talent among artists living East of Amsterdam. And yet, he voluntarily relinquished painting for the sake of a truth that he had gradually recognised to be even more important than painting.” (Géza Perneczky, writing in Új Művészet, October, 2003) As a farewell to his painter period he prepared his artist’s book „My Unpainted Canvasses” (1970), a virtual presentation of his canvasses never actually accomplished. Also in the early 70s, he evolved some of his basic ideas like "Nothing/Zer0", "Rains and Gladnesses" that were to permeate his works in subsequent decades.
The new media he employed in his art include telegrams, picture postcards, T-shirts, Xerox copies, typewriters, films, music, posters, graffiti, banners, actions, artist’s books, street newsreels.
Critics recognised his early „Absent Works” published by Cologne-based DuMont Verlag ("Aktuelle Kunst in Ost-Europa", 1972) to be the very first conceptual works stemming from Eastern-Europe, works that were to be greatly enhanced in subsequent decades. Some other conceptual works of his were also published in Achille Bonito Oliva’s „Europe/America: The Different Avant-Garde” (Milan, 1976).
„He entered the stage of mail art almost in the very first hour”, wrote J. M. Poison in his catalogue of 1971 entitled „Mail Art-Communication - A Distance-Concept”. His fellow mail art correspondents included his later friend Ben Vautier, John Armleder, George Brecht, Daniel Spoerri, Cosey Fanny Tutti, Genesis P-Orridge, Dieter Roth, Marina Abramovich, Ken Friedmann and his dog. His mail art was exhibited at the Paris Bi-Annual of 1972 together with art by such other mail art pioneers as Marcel Duchamp, Yves Klein, Richard Johnson, Ben Vautier, George Brecht. About his letters written with a zero code Pierre Restany, a friend of Yves Klein’s, wrote this in 1978: „In the immaterial zone of a concentrated (ZEROED) sensitivity Endre Tót appears to be the Yves Klein of mail art, a monochrome of postage.”
His first museum exhibition was staged by the Israel Museum in 1975. Since Hungary had severed its diplomatic relations with Israel in 1967, Tót was forced to smuggle his works out of Hungary in an adventurous way. His conceptual works (e.g. his Rainproof-ideas) executed between 1970 and 1974 were exhibited there simultaneously with Alberto Giacometti’s statues. Art magazines in Germany, Italy, and France took note of the exhibition with the Jerusalem Post commenting: "This is not to say that Endre Tot is the same race with Giacometti, but he is a totally new and rewarding experience."
In 1974, the Swiss Howeg Verlag published his sheet of stamps called Zero-Post among the very first artist’s stamps of international mail art.
At the invitation of John Armleder, his later friend who became world-famous for his Neo Geo movement, he spent half a year with the Ecart Gallery of Geneva, an institution also functioning as a mail art centre. It was during his stay in Geneva that he accomplished his first street action (TOTalJoys 1976) which was filmed and later issued on DVD by the Paris Bureau des Videos in 2005.
His artist’s books made in Budapest in the 70s earned him quite a lot of international praise. He had first published them on a samizdat basis but they were later republished by Western-European Avant-Garde publishers. 1971: „My Unpainted Canvasses”,  „The States of Zeros”, „Semmi sem semmi / Nothing ain't Nothing”, 1972: „Nothing”, „Incomplete Informations”, 1974: „Zero-Texts (1971-72)”, „Night Visit to the National Gallery” (Beau Geste Press, UK), „Zero-Post”, „Rainproof Ideas (1971-74)”, 1979: ”TÓTalJOYS”, 1981: ”Very Special Drawings”, 1990: „Evergreen Book”. In 1998, the Paris Bibliothèque Nationale bought several of his artist’s books. The library of the Paris Pompidou Centre acquired his Correspondence avec John Armleder (Ecart, Geneva, 1974) in 2010. His artist’s books were exhibited in many European, American and Canadian museums including the Pompidou Centre’s „Livres d'Artistes” exhibition of 1985.
He was still a resident of Budapest when, in 1977, he exhibited with Galerie Bama, one of the best-known Paris galleries. His show was reviewed in L 'Express by Otto Hahn. Due to his international actions and mail art activities he counted in the West as one of the most notable Eastern-European artists, an appraisal hardly acknowledged in his native country.
He was plucked from the isolation of his Óbuda apartment in the late 70s by an invitation coming from the Berlin Artist Program of DAAD. His applications for an exit permit had been refused by the authorities several times which created a political sensation in the Western press, a circumstance that eventually earned him a permit. After staying in Berlin for a year Tót opted for emigration. His Óbuda apartment was confiscated but his sibling had evacuated his works stored there in the nick of time. After being stored in various low-key places, they were eventually deposited with the Hungarian National Gallery in an orderly fashion.
It was in West-Berlin that Tót came to realise the ideas that he had taken with him in his suitcase and in his mind from Budapest. Shortly after arriving, he placed the following inscription upon the Berlin Wall: „Ich würde mich freuen, wenn ich etwas auf die andere Seite der Mauer schreiben dürfte” (I should be glad if I were allowed to write something on the other side of this wall). He demonstrated his joys ("TÓTalJOYs") with posters in his hand or upon his back in the busiest spots of the metropolis. He even placed a flickering sentence speaking about his joy among the news items of a street newsreel atop a Kurfürstendamm building. In 1978 DAAD filmed and published in book form his street action named TOTalJOYS. He twice exhibited his works with Galerie René Block, an institution previously hosting such notables as Joseph Beuys, Richard Hamilton, Allan Kaprow, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell. The irony inherent in his actions and mail art definitely links him up with the fluxus movement in Germany. He was the sole Eastern-European protagonist of the itinerant exhibition organised by René Block entitled „Fluxus in Germany 1962-1992”.

==The 80s – Blackout in Cologne==
After a stay of one and a half years in Berlin he moved to Cologne with his German wife Herta. The first years of his Cologne period were much less productive than his stay in Berlin. He hardly ever worked until the mid-80s. Invited by Artist Place, he flew to New York City in 1982 with a piece of chalk in his pocket that he used for placing graffiti on the walls of the gallery. It was here that he met up with a great number of notable artists including Alan Kaprow and his friend of old, John Armleder.
With the „blackout years” gone, as he himself called them, he started to work again feverishly from the late 80s on. He elaborated on the idea of „absent paintings”, an idea dating back to his Budapest years (My Unpainted Canvasses, 1970, Night Visit to the National Gallery, A Visit to the Museum,  both in 1974). With his „absent paintings” he accomplished a virtual return to painting but this was tantamount in his case to its final destruction. The spirit nurturing his Blackout and Catalogued paintings comes from an aesthetics of dearth[1] . Conceived in an aesthetics of disappearance, his „absent” works attempt to visualise nothing and void itself. His large work entitled „Dada Messe in Berlin” was exhibited at the show ICONOCLASH: Beyond the Image Wars in Science, Religion and Art (ZKM, Karlsruhe, 2002) presenting major iconoclastic works by Dürer, Rembrandt, Goya, Duchamp, Malevich, Picabia, Warhol, Beuys etc. At the Bremen exhibition „Who Killed the Painting?” (Museum für Moderne Kunst, 2010) his large triptych „Fluxus Triptichon” (2002, 3 x 200 x 125&amp;nbsp;cm) was on view alongside works by Beuys, Kaprow, Ben Vautier, G. Brecht, Al Hausen, Nam June Paik etc.

==The 90s – Retrospectives and Entering the Canon==
After the political change of 1989-1990 in Hungary Tót returned to his native country with his works created abroad. He filled all 12 exhibiting halls of the Palace of the Arts with them under the evocative title of „Nothing is Nothing”. Four years later he exhibited with the Cologne Ludwig Museum (Who is afraid of Nothing?), and this selection of his works was re-exhibited with the Budapest branch of the Ludwig Museum in 1999. Tót is the first Hungarian artist to have been asked to put on an individual show at the Kassel Documenta. Curators there insisted on using the Hungarian title of his Budapest show (Semmi sem semmi) probably because they liked its exotic sound. His action on the city’s main square involving him distributing flyers with a black mask hiding his face was cut short by the police even though the flyers contained no information at all. Along with his works accomplished in his studio, his street actions have also helped him achieve international fame. 
„I am glad that I have stood here” – this was inscribed in Hungarian on his bronze plaque placed in the pavement in 1998 in front of [[Artpool Art Research Center|Artpool's]] art space in Budapest (60, Paulay Ede St.). Six years later a similarly inscribed plaque („Ich freue mich, dass ich hier gestanden habe”) was placed in the floor of the roof terrace of the Cologne Ludwig Museum. 
His Flyer, Zero, Joy etc. street actions as satellite events to international exhibitions have embarrassed or enraged passers-by in many cities over the decades, not infrequently causing even the police to intervene. International critics usually evaluate those anti-demonstrations by Tót to be responses to the mandatory political demonstrations that he had lived through as a young man in totalitarian Hungary.

==The 2000s==
A photo documentation of Tót’s earliest street action was exhibited at the international show „Protest &amp; Survive” put on by the famous London Whitechapel Gallery. Requested by the curators, he also re-staged his remarkable Geneva street action. The catalogue said this about his actions: „Tót's response to the censorship, isolation and suppression inherent in a totalitarian state was to produce his series of joy”. At the exhibition staged by the Vienna Kunstforum entitled „Superstars von Warhol bis Madonna” (2005) his conceptual paperwork „depicting” or rather just marking Mona Lisa’s (absent) smile was on view alongside Duchamps’ famous moustached Mona Lisa. 
The New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) had acquired several works of his created during his Budapest isolation and exhibited them in 2006 at its show „Eye on Europe – 1960 to Now”. Along with Czech artist Milan Knizak, Tót was the only exhibiting artist coming from Eastern Europe. Two years later MoMA director Glenn D. Lowry presented an Honorary Artist Membership to him.

==The 2010s – Tót in Collections==
In 2010 he exhibited with such wide-ranging institutions as Neues Museum Nürnberg, Museum für Moderne Kunst Wesenburg - Bremen, Centre Georges Pompidou Paris, The V. Koc Foundation Contemporary Art Collection Istanbul. The Pompidou Centre’s catalogue published a copy of his 1975 letter to Pierre Restany ending with the words: „So I'm fucked with my zer0000000000000s”. Simultaneously, the Paris Hungarian Institute staged a show of the Iparterv Group of Artists (Le Progrés de l'Illusion), where Tót’s early (1966/67) informel paintings and paperworks were also on view.
His conceptual works were acquired from 1975 through 2010 by such major collections as those of MoMA New York, Getty Museum Los Angeles, Museum Ludwig Köln, Neue Nationalgalerie Berlin, Israel Museum Jerusalem, Haags Gemeentemuseum The Hague, and the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts as well as East-Central European museums like National Gallery Prague, Museum Stuki Łódź, Museum of Modern Art Ljubjana, National Gallery of Art Varsaw, Museum of Modern Art Olmütz, Hungarian National Gallery, Ludwig Museum Budapest, or even two museums in Latin-America: the Center de Arte y Communication (CAYC) Buenos Aires, and the Museu de Arte Contemporaneu da Universidade de São Paulo. 
Probably more than a hundred of his major works are preserved in such notable private collections as Sammlung Dr. Speck (Cologne), Sammlung René Block (Berlin), Das Archive Sohm (Stuttgart), The Sacker Archive of Concrete und Visual Poetry (Miami Beach, Florida).
In 2009 he published a memoir entitled „I’m glad that I can write one sentence after another” with Noran Publishers, Budapest. A critic wrote this about the book: „This is half-way between a logbook and an autonomous work of art since the primacy of the text is questioned throughout by its unusual layout and illustrations… The account Tót gives of his youthful love-affair is deeply moving, the way he recalls the relationship of the regime towards its artists in the 60s and 70s, convincing, and the list of his fleeting affairs with girls is very funny.”
Due to the extreme multiplicity of Tót’s oeuvre, it is next to impossible to understand his art without a thorough-going theoretical back-up.

'''''Evacuate Earth''''' is a [[National Geographic Channel]] documentary that portrays the hypothetical scenario of  humans evacuating the planet Earth before it is destroyed by a rogue [[neutron star]]. The documentary details the technical and social complications of building a [[generation ship]] to save humanity and other Earth organisms by relocating to a planet in another solar system. 

== Premise ==
The documentary proposes a [[thought experiment]] in which a neutron star approaches Earth.  Constant [[meteor storm]]s are the first warning sign, and dramatic sequences depict widespread destruction and the deaths of thousands of people.  Given seventy-five years to prepare, human society radically shifts toward the evacuation of Earth.  The propulsion system for the spacecraft is the first problem to be addressed.  In a dramatic sequence, the world's leading experts debate the benefits and drawbacks of various methods. Conventional rockets are too slow, and antimatter engines are too unstable; they eventually settle on [[nuclear pulse propulsion]], as originally suggested by [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]].  The world's engineers, scientists, and manufacturing workers begun work at a new site dubbed Starship City.  Interviewed experts propose that fatalism may drive some people either to suicide or radicalism and attempts to sabotage the project.  In one dramatic sequence, terrorists strike the facility, though they are destroyed by a hidden minefield.  Brush fire conflicts also escalate, as security forces are focused on either maintaining order or protecting the interstellar project's facilities and personnel.

Who is to be evacuated is another major issue.  Although diversity is respected, any selected individual would have to be genetically hardy and not predisposed toward disease (such as [[schizophrenia]] and [[diabetes]]).  In dramatic sequences, a second ark ship is announced amid controversy, as it is reserved for the world's wealthiest and most powerful families willing to pay for passage.  Simulated newscasts announce delays and setbacks as scientists are lured to the private ark ship.  As the neutron star enters our solar system, Saturn is destroyed, and the Earth experiences calamitous shifts in its seasons and bursts of radiation leading to fatalities and ecological damage.  The private ark ship, equipped with an antimatter engine, explodes when its antimatter containment fails.  Families are potentially broken up as they prepare to board the remaining ark ship, and experts discuss the basic necessities for human life: bacteria, air, water, and food. Bacteria are easily stored, and air is synthesized from water. Food, however, remains a difficult problem, and experts propose that colonists will eat insects and algae, which are easily replenished and space efficient.

The ark ship launches and quickly speeds away, a few days later the neutron star is close enough that its [[tidal force]] begins to deform the [[Earth's core]] and the crust, which causes massive earthquakes and volcanism.  Next, the gravity from the neutron star tears away the surface, causing the crust to shatter and the hot interior of Earth to spill out into the vacuum of space, destroying the Earth, but only the colonists on the ark can witness this event, as the rest of humanity had already been wiped out.  The colonists continue their journey to [[Barnard's Star]]; experts discuss the potential for mutiny and factionalism, ultimately rejecting them as unlikely, as strong family and societal bonds will be emphasized.  The journey is estimated to take approximately eighty-eight years, and the youngest of the original crew survive to see the new planet, which potentially harbors other lifeforms.  Experts conclude that the scenario, though unlikely, is possible and requires preparation from the world's governments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4805">In [[philosophy]], '''facticity''' ({{Lang-fr|facticité}}, {{Lang-de|Faktizität}})&lt;ref name="Faktizität"&gt;{{cite book |first=Daniel O. |last=Dahlstrom |title=The Heidegger Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lUtMAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |date=2013 | pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5aWnJDAxbfwC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=%22facticity+(Faktizität)%22 71–2] |isbn=978-1-847-06514-8 |id={{ISBN|1-84706514-7}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a multiplicity of meanings from "factuality" and "contingency" to the intractable conditions of [[human existence]].&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, Jean-Paul. ''[[Being and Nothingness]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early usage==

The term is first used by German philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] (1762-1814) and has a variety of meanings. It can refer to facts and factuality, as in nineteenth-century [[positivism]], but comes to mean that which resists explanation and interpretation in [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Neo-Kantianism]]. The Neo-Kantians contrasted facticity with ideality, as does [[Jürgen Habermas]] in ''[[Between Facts and Norms]]'' (''Faktizität und Geltung'').

==Heidegger==
German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889-1976) discusses "facticity"&lt;ref name="Faktizität"/&gt; as the "[[thrownness]]" (''Geworfenheit'') of individual existence, which is to say we are "thrown into the world."  By this, he is not only referring to a brute fact, or the factuality of a concrete historical situation, e.g., "born in the '80s." Facticity is something that already informs and has been taken up in existence, even if it is unnoticed or left unattended. As such, facticity is not something we come across and directly behold. In moods, for example, facticity has an enigmatic appearance, which involves both turning toward and away from it. For Heidegger, moods are conditions of thinking and willing to which they must in some way respond. The ''thrownness'' of human existence (or ''[[Dasein]]'') is accordingly disclosed through moods.

==Sartre and de Beauvoir==
In the mid-20th Century works of French existentialists [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]], facticity signifies all of the concrete details against the background of which human freedom exists and is limited. For example, these may include the time and place of birth, a language, an environment, an individual's previous choices, as well as the inevitable prospect of their death. For example: currently, the situation of a person who is born without legs precludes their freedom to walk on the beach; if future medicine were to develop a method of growing new legs for that person, their facticity might no longer exclude this activity.

==Recent usage==
It is a term that takes on a more specialized meaning in 20th century [[continental philosophy]], especially in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]], including [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Theodor Adorno]]. Recent philosophers such as [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], and [[François Raffoul]] have taken up the notion of facticity in new ways.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Facticity plays a key part in [[Quentin Meillassoux]]'s philosophical project to challenge the thought-world relationship of [[correlationism]].  It is defined by him as “the absence of reason for any reality; in other words, the impossibility of providing an ultimate ground for the existence of any being.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meillassoux |first=Quentin |authorlink=Quentin Meillassoux |title=Time Without Becoming |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:0uhYxWi1vLoJ:https://speculativeheresy.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/3729-time_without_becoming.pdf+&amp;hl=en |date=8 May 2008 |accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Food or drink competitions''' reward products primarily for their "gustative worth" in the form of an award or a medal. These competitions can be classified into different categories, and most awards are product-specific, such as for wines, beers, and cheeses. Others focus on local, regional and/or national products. Finally, the international competitions test all kinds of foods and drinks available to consumers on a retail basis. Wine is probably the most tested drink, followed by beer and spirits.

There is a variety of such food and drink competitions worldwide, where the taste and quality of products are assessed. Most evaluations are carried out blind, sometimes complemented by laboratory analysis. The jury usually consists of a panel of different types of "experts" in tastings such as chefs or [[sommelier]]s. 

The history of degustation tests is unclear; however, one of the earliest taste awards recorded for drinks is the [[Brewing Industry International Awards]], dating back to 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brewingawards.org/articles_30_competition-history_2_awards.html Brewing Awards - Welcome to the International Brewing Awards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For food, [[Monde Selection]] is the oldest award recorded, first run in 1961. Since then, as the variety of food products on the market has grown, so has the number of competitions and evaluations.

Monde Selection states that "This bronze, silver, gold or grand gold quality label can be compared to the quality stars of a hotel or those of the [[Michelin Guide]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-selection.com/en/1.0_Activities_and_Awards/1.1_Our_Mission/1.1_Our_Mission.asp |title=Monde Selection : Our Mission |date= |accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, whilst both processes are anonymous, Michelin chooses the hotels and restaurants it reviews and pays for everything. Only products who pay the Euro 1,100 entry fee are reviewed by Monde Selection. Unlike [[Olympic medal|Olympic gold, silver and bronze medals]], where only one of each is awarded per event, there are no limits to how many can be awarded in each category. Other competitions use a similar business model.

Most awarding organizations charge an entry fee. Alternatively, for some awards, producers or retailers pay a fee only if their products are awarded and/or they decide to communicate about the award (payment for the right to show the award on packaging).&lt;ref&gt;http://download.dlg.org/pdf/bier/DLG-Test_Bier07.pdf2 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819190203/http://download.dlg.org/pdf/bier/DLG-Test_Bier07.pdf |date=2008-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In both cases, one might think that these recognitions can be bought. However, tastings are carried out independently and are blind-tested, where judges focus exclusively on sensory ([[organoleptic]]) features, such as taste, olfaction, vision, aspect, mouth-feel, after-taste, without being influenced by packaging, branding or marketing. Of course, only producers who pay the entry fee can make use of any award made.

==Competitions==
These are all pay to enter:
* [[International Wine Contest]]
* [[Monde Selection]]
* [[New York International Olive Oil Competition]]
* [[Superior Taste Award]]
* [[World Beer Cup]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4189">'''Guru Vandana''' means “Reverence for the Teacher” – it is the thanksgiving from a student to a teacher, expressing his or her gratitude.  The Guru Vandana program provides a platform for students to honor their teachers for imparting knowledge and wisdom to them.

==GURU==

The concept of [[Guru]] is as old as humanity itself. Primarily, the word Guru means a 'teacher' and as such it is a universal concept based on the idea of transmitting knowledge from a person, who knows something, to an ignorant student or disciple. In an extended view, a Guru can also be a priest, a rabbi, a master, a school teacher, even a father or a mother.
Guru does not mean a teacher imparting formal training but a person who contributes to the overall development and learning of an individual.

Guru transforms his disciple through his presence and spiritual knowledge. According to [[RamaKrishna Prarahamsa]] Spiritual knowledge can not be attained completely by reading books. But for obtaining complete spiritual enlightenment Guru’s presence is a must. Only when there is a strong bond between Guru and [[Shishya]] spiritual enlightenment might takes place.

'''Origins of [[Guru Shishya]] Parampara'''

Thus our great [[sanathana dharma]] tradition has been enriched by the GURU-SISHYA relationship. [[Lord Rama]]'s greatness lay in His relationship with His most loyal disciple [[HANUMAN]] who taught the essence of [[Ramanamamritim]].  Lord [[Krishna]] gave us the [[Bhagavad Gita]], thanks to his devoted and most trusted disciple [[Arjuna]].  Saint [[Ramakrishna Paramahamsa]] gave to the world [[Swami Vivekananda]] who in turn gave to the world the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], embodying the soul of India. Saint Thyagaraja, an avatar of [[Sage Valmiki]], composed hundreds of soulful Krithis in praise of God. Two Krithis, in particular, refer to the GURU'S role in guiding the seeker on the right path.  Guru leka in 'Gowrimanohari' raga is a Krithi in which the Saint of [[Thiruvaiyar]] sings how one who is trapped in the jungle of desire, can come out of it with help of the right [[Guru]].  Saint Thyagaraja says however learned and good a person might be, life would be meaningless without the guidance of a [[Satguru]].  In another Krithi, Sri Naradamuni Gururaya ganti in [[Bhairavi]] raga, Thyagaraja explains how [[Satguru Smaranam]] helps one in getting rid of ignorance.

==In modern times==

[[United States|American]] [[Hindu Education Foundation]] (HEF) had conducted the program in [[Houston]] in which over 30 teachers and a principal were honored by students.  Children from Houston Balagokulams area picked up their favorite teachers. Acharya Premchand Sridhar of Arya Samaj Houston presided over the program.  The program started with Sridhar lighting the lamp and it was followed by cultural programs and with the explanation of Hindu Concept of Gurus. After the felicitation of teachers Veda Vrinda group chanted the section of the Taittariya Upanishad known as the Vedic Commencement Address.  Columbus chapter of HEF is planning to conduct similar program in October 2008.

Guruvandana is also performed by disciples to spiritual masters. During GuruVandana program [[GuruGita]] is recited by disciple to honor his guru.  [[GuruGita]] forms section of [[Skanda Purana]]. In [[Bangalore]] Guruvandana was offered to [[Sankaracharya]] of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam, Sri Jayendra Saraswathi. Despite rains lots of people gathered in Malleshwaram to felicitate their Spiritual Guru.  In [[ISKCON]] temples Guruvandana is performed for spiritual Guru Srila [[Prabhupada]] throughout the year.

==In other religions==

Apart from Hinduism Guru-Shishya concept is followed in other religions like Jain, Sikh, Buddhism. In fact the word Sikh has origins from Sanskrit 'shishya'. Jains celebrate Guru Vandana as part of their rituals.

A '''gynandromorph''' is an organism that contains both [[male]] and [[female]] characteristics. The term ''gynandromorph'', from Greek "gyne" female,  "andro" male, and "morphé" form, is mainly used in [[entomology]]. These organisms are notable in butterflies, moths and other insects, where both male and female body parts can be distinguished physically because of [[sexual dimorphism]].

== Occurrence in other genera ==
Gynandromorphism has been observed in numerous animal species, e.g., [[crustaceans]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; such as [[lobsters]] and [[crabs]], many [[bird]] species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=7730–5 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0408350102 |laysummary=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=unique-bird-sheds-light-o |laysource=[[Scientific American]] |laydate=March 25, 2003 |title=Sexually dimorphic expression of trkB, a Z-linked gene, in early posthatch zebra finch brain |year=2005 |first1=Xuqi |last1=Chen |first2=Robert J. |last2=Agate |first3=Yuichiro |last3=Itoh |first4=Arthur P. |last4=Arnold |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=102 |issue=21 |pmid=15894627 |pmc=1140405|bibcode=2005PNAS..102.7730C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gouldian finch]]

These birds have lateralised brain structures in the face of a common steroid signal, providing strong evidence for a non-hormonal primary sex mechanism regulating brain differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=701–8 |doi=10.1038/nrn1494 |title=Sex chromosomes and brain gender |year=2004 |last1=Arnold |first1=Arthur P. |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=5 |issue=9 |pmid=15322528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pattern of distribution of male and female tissues in a single organism ==
A gynandromorph can have [[bilateral symmetry|bilateral asymmetry—]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;one side female and one side male.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/12/half-male-half-female-butterfly | title=Half male, half female butterfly steals the show at Natural History Museum | publisher=The Guardian | date=12 July 2011 | accessdate=August 6, 2011 | author=Ian Sample, science correspondent | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, the distribution of male and female tissue can be more haphazard.

Bilateral gynandromorphy arises very early in development, typically when the organism has between 8 and 64 cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Malmquist |date=June 15, 2005 |title=Rare crab may hold genetic secrets |url=http://www.vims.edu/newsandevents/topstories/archives/2005/dual_sex_crab.php |publisher=Virginia Institute of Marine Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later stages produce a more random pattern.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

== Causes ==
The cause of this phenomenon is typically, but not always, an event in [[mitosis]] during early development.  While the organism contains only a few cells, one of the dividing cells does not split its sex chromosomes typically.  This leads to one of the two cells having sex chromosomes that cause male development and the other cell having chromosomes that cause female development.  For example, an XY cell undergoing mitosis duplicates its chromosomes, becoming XXYY.  Usually this cell would divide into two XY cells, but in rare occasions the cell may divide into an X cell and an XYY cell. If this happens early in development, then a large portion of the cells are X and a large portion are XYY.  Since X and XYY dictate different sexes, the organism has tissue that is female and tissue that is male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James K.|last=Adams|date= |title=Gynandromorphs |url=http://www.daltonstate.edu/galeps/Gynandromorphs.htm |publisher=Department of Natural Sciences, Dalton State College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A developmental network theory of how gynandromorphs develop from a single cell based on internetwork links between parental [[allelic]] [[chromosomes]] is given in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |first=Eric|last=Werner|year= 2012 |title=A Developmental Network Theory of Gynandromorphs, Sexual Dimorphism and Species Formation |arxiv=1212.5439}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major types of gynandromorphs, bilateral, polar and oblique are computationally modeled.  Many other possible gynandromorph combinations are computationally modeled, including predicted morphologies yet to be discovered. The article relates gynandromorph developmental control networks to how species may form. The models are based on a computational model of [[bilateral symmetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |first=Eric|last=Werner|year= 2012 |title=The Origin, Evolution and Development of Bilateral Symmetry in Multicellular Organisms |arxiv=1207.3289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a research tool ==
Gynandromorphs occasionally afford a powerful tool in genetic, developmental, and behavioral analyses.  In ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', for instance, they provided evidence that male courtship behavior originates in the brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hotta|first=Y, and Benzer, S.|date=1972|title=Mapping of Behaviour in Drosophila mosaics|url=|journal=Nature|volume=240|pages=527–535|doi=10.1038/240527a0|via=|bibcode=1972Natur.240..527H}}&lt;/ref&gt; that males can distinguish conspecific females from males by the scent or some other characteristic of the posterior, dorsal, [[integument]] of females,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|date=1975|title=A new behavioral bioassay for an analysis of sexual attraction and pheromones in insects|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|volume=192 |issue=2|pages=271–5|doi=10.1002/jez.1401920217|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hotta|first=Y., Benzer, S.|date=1976|title=Courtship in Drosophila mosaics: sex-specific foci for sequential action patterns|url=|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|volume=73 |issue=11|pages=4154–4158|doi=10.1073/pnas.73.11.4154|via=|bibcode=1976PNAS...73.4154H}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the germ cells originate in the posterior-most region of the [[blastoderm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1977|title=Cell lineage analysis of germ cells of Drosophila melanogaster|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v265/n5596/abs/265729a0.html|journal=Nature|volume=265|pages=729–731|doi=10.1038/265729a0|via=|bibcode=1977Natur.265..729N}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that somatic components of the gonads originate in the mesodermal region of the fourth and fifth abdominal segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Szabad|first=Janos, and Nothiger, Rolf|date=1992|title=Gynandromorphs of Drosophila suggest one common primordium for the somatic cells of the female and male gonads in the region of abdominal segments 4 and 5|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/develop/115/2/527.full.pdf|journal=Development|volume=115|pages=527–533|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
In his autobiography, ''Speak, Memory'', the writer and [[lepidopterist]] [[Vladimir Nabokov]] describes a gynandromorph butterfly, male on one side, female on the other, that he caught as a youth on his family's [[Russia]]n estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nabokov|first=Vladimir|title=Speak, Memory|year=1967|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kim Stanley Robinson's novel, ''[[2312 (novel)|2312]]'', some people choose to turn themselves into functional gynandromorphs.  For example, the main protagonist, Swan Er Hong, is a gynandromorph.  She was born a female, identifies herself as one, and mothered children.  But she also fathered children, after acquiring male reproductive organs.

{{cite bailii|litigants='''Hughes v Lord Advocate'''|year=1963|court=UKHL|num=31}} is an important Scottish [[Scots delict|delict]] case decided by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] on [[Causation (law)|causation]]. The case is also influential in [[negligence]] in the [[English law of tort]] (even though [[English law]] does not recognise "[[allurement]]" ''per se'').

The case's main significance is that, after the shift within the [[common law]] of [[English law of negligence|negligence]] from [[strict liability]]&lt;ref&gt;As in ''[[Re Polemis]]''&lt;/ref&gt; to a reasonable standard of care,&lt;ref&gt;As in [[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' and  ''[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd|The Wagon Mound]]''&lt;/ref&gt; this case advocated a middle way, namely: 
*Even if the loss or harm is not itself foreseeable, liability may arise provided the actual loss falls with a "foreseeable class of harm". 
This idea was neither developed nor expanded upon, and only one year later the claimant in ''[[Doughty v Turner Manufacturing]]'' obtained no remedy ''via'' this "middle way".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/Doughty-v-Turner-Manufacturing-Company.php ''Doughty v Turner Manufacturing Company'' case report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doughty v Turner Manufacturing Company [1964] 1 QB 518&lt;/ref&gt; However, the case was followed in subsequent cases on [[occupiers' liability]].

==Facts==
One evening in November 1958 two boys aged 8 and 10&lt;ref&gt;The older boy was the younger boy's uncle.&lt;/ref&gt; were walking down Russell Road, [[Edinburgh]] where some [[Post Office]] workers were repairing cables under the street. The men had opened a manhole and had erected a weather tent over it, with an access ladder inside. From mid-afternoon onwards, the tent had four red paraffin warning lamps. The workmen left around 5pm for a tea break nearby; before leaving, they withdrew the ladder, leaving it outside the tent.

While the workmen were out, the boys arrived and started meddling with the equipment. They picked up one of the lamps and entered the tent. They took the ladder and proceeded to explore the manhole, after which they safely climbed out again. The younger boy tripped over the lamp, which fell into the manhole and broke. The paraffin leaked and vaporised, causing an explosion with flames reaching up to thirty feet. The impact of the blast caused the 8-year old to fall into the hole and suffer severe burn injuries.

The question arose whether the Post Office workers had been negligent in leaving the site  unattended with the lamps burning. Under Scots law, they owed a duty of reasonable care to prevent the  site becoming an "allurement" for the boys; had they discharged this duty? On the other hand, the children were trespasser and possibly contributorily negligence. A crucial issue was the likelihood (or foreseeability) of the presence of children on Russell Road, and whether the explosion causing the serious burn injuries  was of "different type than that could have been foreseeable".

The court of first instance, the [[First Division of the Court of Session]], limited the liability of the Post Office on the grounds that although the danger to children was foreseeable the accident itself was not foreseeable. The defence had argued that the boys were not only [[trespass]]ers but also [[contributory negligence|contributorily negligeny]], but the court responded that the Post Office did not have any exclusive interest in the middle of the road to support a claim of trespass; and taking into consideration the youth of the boy, it was agreed that he was NOT contributorily negligence; and these points were dropped on appeal to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]).

==Judgment on appeal==
[[David Jenkins, Baron Jenkins|Lord Jenkins]] addressed the duty of issue of care established by [[Lord Atkin]] in ''[[Donoghue v. Stevenson]],'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Donoghue v. Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 562]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''Donoghue v. Stevenson'' Lord Atkin had declared that you take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour."&lt;/ref&gt; saying:  "the Post Office had brought on the public highway apparatus capable of constituting a source of danger to passer-by ... It was therefore their duty that such passerby, "neighbour" in the language of ''Donoghue v. Stevenson'', were, so far as reasonably practicable, protected from the various obstacles or allurements, which the workmen had brought to the site. It is clear that the safety precautions taken by the Post Office did not in this instance measure up to Lord Atkin's test."

[[John Morris, Baron Morris of Borth-y-Gest|Lord Morris]] stated that "exercising an ordinary, and certainly not an over-exacting, degree of prevention the workmen should have decided, when the tea-break came, that someone had better be left in charge who could repel the intrusion of inquisitive children," thereby casting doubt that the workers had discharged their duty of care.

In both the First Division and in the House of Lords, the defence argued that it was unforeseeable that children might be on Russell Road, "a quiet road, some four hundred yards away from any houses". Lord Morris opined (following the judgement of Lord Ordinary) that "if, of, course, there was no likelihood that children might appear, different considerations would apply. But children did appear, and I find no reason to differ from the conclusion of the Lord Ordinary that the presence of children in the immediate vicinity of the shelter was reasonably to be anticipated."

[[Christopher Guest, Baron Guest|Lord Guest]] declared that the burden of proof that the presence of children lay with the respondent; and on the facts there was insufficient evidence to do this. Lord Guest accepted that it was reasonable to anticipate the danger that might arise by meddling children, and that that, "... the normal dangers of such children falling into the manhole and injured by a lamp were such that a reasonable man would not have ignored them."

It was accepted that the explosion causing the burns was a result of paraffin leaking from the lamp. According to Lord Reid, the boy's injuries from burns was foreseeable. Although the extent of the injury of burn was greater than might have been expected, this was no defence. However, if the injury were of a different kind than the foreseeable type the defender might have escaped liability.

[[James Reid, Baron Reid|Lord Reid]] continued that as the cause of the accident &amp;ndash; the explosion from paraffin lamp &amp;ndash; was known, it left no scope to allege the accident was caused from some unknown source, rather than the fault of respondent. Lord Reid concluded that the accident in question "was but a variant of foreseeable" and it mattered not it may have arisen in an unforeseeable manner.

Lord Jenkins agreed, finding no justification to hold someone liable if the accident had occurred from the burning of lamp but not if the lamp had exploded.

[[John Morris, Baron Morris of Borth-y-Gest|Lord Morris]] agreed, saying that the injury suffered by the boy was of a higher degree, but was "of the kind or type of accident which was foreseeable". He said the respondent "should not escape liability just because they could not foresee the exact way" in which the boy might play with the equipment, or the way in which he might get hurt. Allowing the appeal, Lord Morris said there was a duty owed by the respondent to safeguard the boy against the type or kind of occurrence which in fact happened and which resulted in his injuries, and the defenders are not absolved from liability because they didn't envisage "the precise concatenation of circumstances which lead up to the accident."

Lord Guest pointed out that for making a coherent chain of causation it is not necessary to follow the minute details leading up to the accident to be reasonably foreseeable, but only that "the type of accident caused was of a foreseeable type". He was of the view that the lower courts wrongly gave more emphasis on the fact on explosion; to Lord Guest it was a non-essential element. He gave more emphasis on the fact whether burning of paraffin outside the lamp was a reasonable foreseeable event. The lower courts had already concluded these events as a reasonable foreseeable event, but they were of the view the explosion was an unforeseeable event. Lord Guest argued this as a "fallacious" claim. Lord Guest concluded that the accident and the injuries sustained by the boys should have been reasonably foreseen by Post Office employees, who were in breach of duty to take adequate protection against the accident.

[[Lord Pearce]] cited the case of ''[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd|The Wagon Mound]]'' which held that a person is not liable if the accident is of a different type than the type which was foreseen by the person. It would be unjust to check each and every details of the foreseeability test too minutely when the case deals with things that can be allurement to children leads to an accident and hard to foresee the exact way in which the accident may take place.

In sum, all the judges allowed the boy's appeal. The decision was followed in ''[[Jolley v Sutton London Borough Council]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jolley v Sutton London Borough Council]]'' [2000] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/31.html 1 WLR 1082]&lt;/ref&gt;

(For a similar case arising under [[US law]], see ''[[Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.|Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.]]'' 248 N.Y. 339, 162 [[North Eastern Reporter|N.E.]] 99 (1928)&lt;/ref&gt; a case which had been influential upon the court in ''Donoghue v Stevenson'').

{{Buddhism}}
'''Humans in Buddhism''' (Sanskrit {{IAST|'''manuṣya'''}}, Pali {{IAST|'''manussa'''}}) are the subjects of an extensive commentarial literature that examines the nature and qualities of a human life from the point of view of humans' ability to achieve [[Bodhi|enlightenment]]. In Buddhism, humans  are just one type of [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient being]], that is a being with a [[mindstream]]. In Sanskrit Manushya means an Animal with a mind. In Sanskrit the word Manusmriti associated with Manushya was used to describe knowledge through memory. The word Muun or Maan means mind. Mind is collection of past experience with an ability of memory or smriti. Mind is considered as a animal with a disease that departs a soul from its universal enlightened infinitesimal behavior to the finite miserable fearful behavior that fluctuates between the state of heaven and hell before it is extinguished back to its infinitesimal behavior. 

In Buddhism, humans have a very special status: only a human can attain enlightenment as a fully enlightened [[Buddhahood|Buddha]].  Enlightenment as an [[arhat]] can be attained from the realms of the [[Buddhist cosmology#Pure Abodes|Śuddhāvāsa deities]].  A [[bodhisattva]] can appear in many different types of lives, for instance as an [[Animals in Buddhism|animal]] or as a [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]].  Buddhas, however, are always human.&lt;ref&gt;JOL 14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qualities of human life ==
The status of life as a human, at first is seen as very important.  In the hierarchy of [[Buddhist cosmology]] it is low but not entirely at the bottom.  It is not intrinsically marked by extremes of happiness or [[dukkha|suffering]], but all the states of consciousness in the universe, from hellish suffering to divine joy to serene tranquility can be experienced within the human world.

Humans can be seen as highly favored, in that they have an immediate reason to seek out the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and yet also have the means to listen to it and follow it.  Among the lower realms, [[Pretas]] (aka hungry ghosts), and dwellers in the [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Narakas]] (Buddhist hell(s)) are gripped by pain and fear, and can only endure their lot but cannot better themselves. Animals are intellectually unable to understand the Dharma in full.  The way of life of the [[Asura (Buddhism)|Asuras]] is dominated by violence and antithetical to the teachings of the Dharma. Most of the Brahmas and Devas simply enjoy reaping the fruits of their past [[Karma in Buddhism|actions]] and think that they are immortal and forever to be happy and so they don't try to practice the Dharma.  When their past karmas have all had their result, these devas will fall into lower worlds and suffer again.  The lowest sorts of devas deal with strife, love, and loss just as humans do, but even so they lack the spur of imminent mortality that can lead humans to seek, not merely a better future life, but an escape from [[Samsara (Buddhism)|{{IAST|saṃsāra}}]] altogether. However, there are stories of beings in these realms deciding to practice and reaching enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Pali Canon (Samyutta Nikaya, Digha Nikaya, Majjhima Nikaya, Anguttara Nikaya, Kuddaka NIkaya)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JOL:14-15, BOTV:63&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, life in the world of humans is known as "the precious human rebirth".  Born close to the pivot point of happiness and suffering, humans have a unique capacity for moral choices with long-term significance.&lt;ref&gt;JOL:18&lt;/ref&gt;

The human rebirth is said to be extremely rare. The Majjhima Nikaya (129 Balapandita Sutta) compares it to a wooden cattle-yoke floating on the waves of the sea, tossed this way and that by the winds and currents.  The likelihood of a blind turtle, rising from the depths of the ocean to the surface once in a hundred years, putting its head through the hole in the yoke is considered greater than that of a being in the animal realm, hungry ghost realm or hell realm achieving rebirth as a human. This is because, according to the sutta, in these realms there is no Dhamma (Sanskrit Dharma), no practicing what is right, no doing what is wholesome, and no performing of merit. However it is generally implied that if one is already living as a human they will continue to be reborn in the human world based on good works and so they will be one again and again as long as they are moral and good in the ways described in Buddhist rules regardless of whether or not they are Buddhist themselves. The idea is that one must be good and moral because falling below the human realm is dangerous as the odds of one becoming a human again with any great frequency is slim.&lt;ref&gt;Majjhima Nikaya 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Among humans there are also better and worse conditions for attaining enlightenment.  Besides being born as a human, the favorable conditions for obtaining enlightenment are:
* Being born a human at a time when a Buddha has arisen, has taught the Dharma, and has left a [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Saṅgha]] that carries on the teachings; at such times there is a chance to learn the Dharma.
* Being born a human in countries where the Dharma is known.  Buddhist commentaries contrast the "central lands" where Buddhism is known and can be practiced (originally just northern India, but now including a much larger portion of the globe) with "border countries" where Buddhism is unknown or cannot be practiced due to legal or practical impediments, for instance, a lack of qualified teachers. Technically a "central land" is one which possesses any one of the Buddhist {{IAST|saṅghas}} of [[Bhikkhu|{{IAST|bhikṣus}}]], [[Bhikkhuni|{{IAST|bhikṣuṇīs}}]], [[Upasaka|upāsakas or upāsikās]].
* Being born a human who has the physical and intellectual capacity to grasp the basic message of the Dharma.
* Accepting the relationship between good or evil actions and their consequences, believing that good actions will lead to a happier life, a better rebirth or to enlightenment.
* Confidence in the moral teachings conveyed in the [[Vinaya]].
* Avoiding crimes against people and against the Dharma.
* Having sincere compassion for other people.&lt;ref&gt;JOL:15-16, BOTV:59-61&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as it is difficult to obtain birth as a human, it is also difficult to be born at the time when a Buddha's teaching is still available.  Out of the infinite ''[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]]'' (incredibly long periods) in time, most have no Buddhas appearing in them at all.  The present kalpa is called "Fortunate" because it is said that 1,000 Buddhas will appear in it, something that is very unusual.&lt;ref&gt;BOTV:61&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, Buddhist teachers say that one's present condition as a human should be valued very highly, and not allowed to slide by, as the combination of existence as a human and the presence of a Buddha's teaching may not come again for a very long time. Any human, in this view, who finds himself or herself in a position to learn the Dharma, would be remiss if he or she did not take advantage of it.  This view also stands in contrast to those who would claim that, if one is to be reborn multiple times, there is no need to worry about one's actions in this life as they can always be amended in the future; rather, there is no assurance that in a long series of lives one will ever obtain the right circumstances for enlightenment, so it is important to seize the day.

With regard to a fortunate human life, [[Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo]] said: "Instead of feeling so much regret when we lose our money, we should develop regret when we waste our human life." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tharpa.com/us/book-Joyful.Path.of.Good.Fortune-587.html ''Joyful Path of Good Fortune''], by Geshe [[Kelsang Gyatso]], Page 133&lt;/ref&gt;

== Myth of human origins==
According to the [[Aggañña Sutta]] (DN.27), humans originated at the beginning of the current kalpa as deva-like beings reborn from the [[Buddhist cosmology#Ābhāsvara worlds|Ābhāsvara]] deva-realm.  They were then beings shining in their own light, capable of moving through the air without mechanical aid, living for a very long time, and not requiring sustenance.

Over time, they acquired a taste for physical nutriment, and as they consumed it, their bodies became heavier and more like human bodies; they lost their ability to shine, and began to acquire differences in their appearance.  Their length of life decreased, they differentiated into two sexes and became sexually active.  Following this, greed, theft and violence arose among them, and they consequently established social distinctions and government and elected a king to rule them, called [[Mahāsammata]], "the great appointed one". Some of the kings of India in the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha´s]] day claimed descent from him.

== Nature of the human realm ==
In the visionary picture of the human realm presented in [[Buddhist cosmology]], humans live on four continents which are, relatively speaking, small islands in a vast ocean that surrounds the axial world-mountain of [[Sumeru]], and fills most of the Earth's surface.  The ocean is in turn surrounded by a circular mountain wall called {{IAST|Cakravāḍa}} ([[Sanskrit]]) or {{IAST|Cakkavāḷa}} ([[Pāli]]) which marks the horizontal limit of the earth. Because of the immenseness of the ocean, the continents cannot be reached from each other by ordinary sailing vessels, although in the past, when the cakravartin kings ruled, communication between the continents was possible by means of the treasure called the '''cakraratna''' (Pāli '''cakkaratana'''), which a cakravartin and his retinue could use to fly through the air between the continents.

The four continents are:

* '''[[Jambudvipa|Jambudvīpa]]''' (Sanskrit) or '''Jambudīpa''' (Pāli) or 南阎浮提洲 (阎浮提 is also translated as 赡部 in Chinese) is located in the south.
* '''Pūrvavideha''' or '''Pubbavideha'''  or 东毗提诃洲 (毗提诃 is also translated as 胜身) is located in the east.
* '''Aparagodānīya''' or '''Aparagoyāna''' or 西瞿陀尼洲 (瞿陀尼 is also translated as 牛货) is located in the west.
* '''Uttarakuru''' or 北俱卢洲 is located in the north.

In [[psychology]], '''identity''' is the qualities, beliefs, personality, looks and/or expressions that make a person ([[self-identity]]) or group (particular social category or [[social group]]).{{cn|date=August 2018}} Categorizing identity can be positive or destructive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year=  2015 | last1 = James | first1 = Paul | authorlink1 = Paul James (academic) | title = Despite the Terrors of Typologies: The Importance of Understanding Categories of Difference and Identity | url= https://www.academia.edu/11768378/_Despite_the_Terrors_of_Typologies_The_Importance_of_Understanding_Categories_of_Difference_and_Identity_ | journal = Interventions: International Journal of Postcolonial Studies | volume =  17 | issue =  2 | pages = 174–195 | quote = The first argument of this essay is that categorizations about identity, even when codified and hardened into clear typologies by processes of colonization, state formation or general modernizing processes, are always full of tensions and contradictions. Sometimes these contradictions are destructive, but they can also be creative and positive.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''psychological identity'' relates to [[self-image]] (one's [[mental model]] of oneself), [[self-esteem]], and [[individuality]]. Consequently, Weinreich gives the definition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A person's identity is defined as the totality of one's self-construal, in which how one construes oneself in the present expresses the continuity between how one construes oneself as one was in the past and how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future"; this allows for definitions of aspects of identity, such as: "One's ethnic identity is defined as that part of the totality of one's self-construal made up of those dimensions that express the continuity between one's construal of past ancestry and one's future aspirations in relation to ethnicity".

[[Gender identity]] forms an important part of identity in psychology, as it dictates to a significant{{quantify|date=August 2018}} degree how one views oneself both as a person and in relation to other people, ideas and nature. Other aspects of identity, such as racial, religious, ethnic, occupational… etc. may also be more or less significant – or significant in some situations but not in others (Weinreich &amp; Saunderson 2003 pp 26–34). In [[cognitive psychology]], the term "identity" refers to the capacity for [[human self-reflection| self-reflection]] and the [[self-awareness |awareness of self]] {{Harv|Leary|Tangney|2003|p=3}}.

[[Sociology]] places some explanatory weight on the concept of [[role]]-behavior. The notion of ''[[identity negotiation]]'' may arise from the learning of social roles through personal experience. Identity negotiation is a process in which a person negotiates with society at large regarding the meaning of his or her identity.

Psychologists most commonly use the term "identity" to describe ''personal identity'', or the idiosyncratic things that make a person unique. Sociologists, however, often use the term to describe ''[[social identity]]'', or the collection of group memberships that define the individual. However, these uses are not proprietary, and each discipline may use either concept and each discipline may combine both concepts when considering a person's identity.

The description or representation of individual and group identity is a central task for psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists and those of other disciplines where "identity" needs to be mapped and defined. How should one describe the identity of another, in ways which encompass both their idiosyncratic qualities and their group memberships or identifications, both of which can shift according to circumstance?  Following on from the work of Kelly, Erikson, Tajfel and others, Weinreich's Identity Structure Analysis (ISA), is "a structural representation of the individual's existential experience, in which the relationships between self and other agents are organised in relatively stable structures over time … with the emphasis on the socio-cultural milieu in which self relates to other agents and [[institution]]s" (Weinreich and Saunderson, (eds) 2003, p1). Using constructs drawn from the salient discourses of the individual, the group and cultural norms, the practical operationalisation of ISA provides a methodology that maps how these are used by the individual, applied across time and milieus by the "situated self" to appraise self and other agents and institutions (for example, resulting in the individual's evaluation of self and [[significant other]]s and institutions).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==In psychology==
[[Erik Erikson]] (1902–1994) became one of the earliest [[psychologist]]s to take an explicit interest in identity. The Eriksonian framework rests upon a distinction among the psychological sense of continuity, known as the ''[[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] identity'' (sometimes identified simply as "the self"); the personal [[idiosyncrasies]] that separate one person from the next, known as the ''personal identity''; and the collection of social roles that a person might play, known as either the ''[[social identity]]'' or the ''[[cultural identity]]''. Erikson's work, in the [[psychodynamic]] tradition, aimed to investigate the process of [[identity formation]] across a lifespan. Progressive strength in the ego identity, for example, can be charted in terms of a series of stages in which identity is formed in response to increasingly sophisticated challenges. The process of forming a viable sense of identity for the culture is conceptualized as an adolescent task, and those who do not manage a resynthesis of childhood identifications are seen as being in a state of 'identity diffusion' whereas those who retain their initially given identities unquestioned have 'foreclosed' identities (Weinreich &amp; Saunderson 2003 p7-8). On some readings of Erikson, the development of a strong ego identity, along with the proper integration into a stable society and culture, lead to a stronger sense of identity in general. Accordingly, a deficiency in either of these factors may increase the chance of an [[identity crisis (psychology)|identity crisis]] or confusion {{Harv|Cote|Levine|2002|p=22}}.

Although the self is distinct from identity, the literature of [[self-psychology]] can offer some insight into how identity is maintained {{Harv|Cote|Levine|2002|p=24}}. From the vantage point of self-psychology, there are two areas of interest: the processes by which a self is formed (the "I"), and the actual content of the [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]] which compose the self-concept (the "Me"). In the latter field, theorists have shown interest in relating the self-concept to [[self-esteem]], the differences between complex and simple ways of organizing [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], and the links between those organizing principles and the processing of information {{Harv|Cote|Levine|2002}}.

The "Neo-Eriksonian" ''identity status'' [[paradigm]] emerged in later years{{when|date=December 2013}}, driven largely by the work of [[James Marcia]]. This paradigm focuses upon the twin concepts of ''exploration'' and ''commitment''. The central idea is that any individual's sense of identity is determined in large part by the explorations and commitments that he or she makes regarding certain personal and social traits. It follows that the core of the research in this paradigm investigates the degrees to which a person has made certain explorations, and the degree to which he or she displays a commitment to those explorations.

A person may display either relative weakness or relative strength in terms of both exploration and commitments. When assigned categories, four possible permutations result: identity diffusion, identity foreclosure, identity moratorium, and identity achievement. Diffusion is when a person lacks both exploration in life and interest in committing even to those unchosen roles that he or she occupies. Foreclosure is when a person has not chosen extensively in the past, but seems willing to commit to some relevant values, goals, or roles in the future. Moratorium is when a person displays a kind of flightiness, ready to make choices but unable to commit to them. Finally, achievement is when a person makes identity choices and commits to them.

Weinreich's identity variant similarly includes the categories of identity diffusion, foreclosure and crisis, but with a somewhat different emphasis. Here, with respect to identity diffusion for example, an optimal level is interpreted as the norm, as it is unrealistic to expect an individual to resolve all their conflicted identifications with others; therefore we should be alert to individuals with levels which are much higher or lower than the norm – highly diffused individuals are classified as diffused, and those with low levels as foreclosed or defensive. (Weinreich &amp; Saunderson, 2003, pp 65–67; 105–106). Weinreich applies the identity variant in a framework which also allows for the transition from one to another by way of biographical experiences and resolution of conflicted identifications situated in various contexts  – for example,  an adolescent going through family break-up may be in one state, whereas later in a stable marriage with a secure professional role may be in another. Hence, though there is continuity, there is also development and change. (Weinreich &amp; Saunderson, 2003, pp 22–23).
 
Laing's definition of identity closely follows Erikson's, in emphasising the past, present and future components of the experienced self. He also develops the concept of the "metaperspective of self", i.e. the self's perception of the other's view of self, which has been found to be extremely important in clinical contexts such as anorexia nervosa. (Saunderson and O'Kane, 2005). Harré also conceptualises components of self/identity – the "person" (the unique being I am to myself and others) along with aspects of self (including a totality of attributes including beliefs about one's characteristics including life history), and the personal characteristics displayed to others.

{{further information|Self (psychology)}}

==In social psychology==
At a general level, [[self-psychology]] is compelled to investigate the question of how the personal self relates to the social environment. To the extent that these theories place themselves in the tradition of [[Social psychology (psychology)|"psychological" social psychology]], they focus on explaining an individual's actions within a group in terms of mental events and states. However, some [[Social psychology (sociology)|"sociological" social psychology]] theories go further by attempting to deal with the issue of identity at both the levels of individual [[cognition]] and of collective behavior.

===Collective identity===
{{main article|Collective identity}}
Many people gain a sense of positive self-esteem from their identity groups, which furthers a sense of [[community]] and belonging. Another issue that researchers have attempted to address is the question of why people engage in [[discrimination]], i.e., why they tend to favor those they consider a part of their "in-group" over those considered to be outsiders. Both questions have been given extensive attention by researchers working in the [[social identity approach|social identity tradition]]. For example, in work relating to [[social identity theory]] it has been shown that merely crafting cognitive distinction between in- and out-groups can lead to subtle effects on people's evaluations of others {{Harv|Cote|Levine|2002}}.&lt;ref name="twente"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Social Identity Theory  | work =  | publisher = Universiteit Twente | date =  | url = http://www.utwente.nl/cw/theorieenoverzicht/Theory%20Clusters/Interpersonal%20Communication%20and%20Relations/Social_Identity_Theory.doc/ | doi =  | accessdate = 2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different social situations also compel people to attach themselves to different self-identities which may cause some to feel marginalized, switch between different groups and self-identifications,&lt;ref&gt;[https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-oxford-handbook-of-multicultural-identity-9780199796694?cc=il&amp;lang=en&amp; Benet-Martínez, V., &amp; Hong, Y-Y. (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt; or reinterpret certain identity components.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254251548_Components_of_intercultural_identity_Towards_an_effective_integration_policy Kislev, E. (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; These different selves lead to constructed images dichotomized between what people want to be (the ideal self) and how others see them (the limited self). Educational background and Occupational status and roles significantly influence identity formation in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;Hurd, E. (2010). [http://qix.sagepub.com/content/16/10/783%20 Confessions of Belonging: My Emotional Journey as a Medical Translator]. Qualitative Inquiry 16(10), 783–791. {{doi|10.1177/1077800410383117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity formation strategies===
Another issue of interest in social psychology is related to the notion that there are certain ''identity formation strategies'' which a person may use to adapt to the social world. {{Harv|Cote|Levine|2002|pp=3–5}} developed a [[Personality type|typology]] which investigated the different manners of behavior that individuals may have. (3) Their typology includes:

{| border=1 class="wikitable" |
|-
|
| '''Psychological symptoms'''
| '''Personality symptoms'''
| '''Social symptoms'''
|-
| ''Refuser ''
| Develops cognitive blocks that prevent adoption of adult role-schemas
| Engages in childlike behavior
| Shows extensive dependency upon others and no meaningful engagement with the community of adults
|-
| ''Drifter ''
| Possesses greater psychological resources than the Refuser (i.e., intelligence, charisma)
| Is apathetic toward application of psychological resources
| Has no meaningful engagement with or commitment to adult communities
|-
| ''Searcher ''
| Has a sense of dissatisfaction due to high personal and social expectations
| Shows disdain for imperfections within the community
| Interacts to some degree with role-models, but ultimately these relationships are abandoned
|-
| ''Guardian ''
| Possesses clear personal values and attitudes, but also a deep fear of change
| Sense of personal identity is almost exhausted by sense of social identity
| Has an extremely rigid sense of social identity and strong identification with adult communities
|-
|'' Resolver ''
| Consciously desires self-growth
| Accepts personal skills and competencies and uses them actively
| Is responsive to communities that provide opportunity for self-growth
|}

[[Kenneth Gergen]] formulated additional classifications, which include the ''strategic manipulator'', the ''pastiche personality'', and the ''relational self''. The strategic manipulator is a person who begins to regard all senses of identity merely as role-playing exercises, and who gradually becomes alienated from his or her social "self". The pastiche personality abandons all aspirations toward a true or "essential" identity, instead viewing social interactions as opportunities to play out, and hence become, the roles they play. Finally, the relational self is a perspective by which persons abandon all sense of exclusive self, and view all sense of identity in terms of social engagement with others. For Gergen, these strategies follow one another in phases, and they are linked to the increase in popularity of [[postmodern]] culture and the rise of telecommunications technology.

==In social anthropology==
[[Anthropologist]]s have most frequently employed the term 'identity' to refer to this idea of selfhood in a loosely [[Erik Erikson|Eriksonian way]]  (Erikson 1972) properties based on the uniqueness and individuality which makes a person distinct from others. Identity became of more interest to anthropologists with the emergence of modern concerns with [[ethnicity]] and [[social movements]] in the 1970s. This was reinforced by an appreciation, following the trend in sociological thought, of the manner in which the individual is affected by and contributes to the overall [[social context]]. At the same time, the Eriksonian approach to identity remained in force, with the result that identity has continued until recently to be used in a largely socio-historical way to refer to qualities of sameness in relation to a person's connection to others and to a particular group of people.

The first favours a primordialist approach which takes the sense of self and [[social group|belonging]] to a collective group as a fixed thing, defined by objective criteria such as common [[ancestry]] and common [[biometrics|biological characteristics]]. The second, rooted in [[social constructionist]] theory, takes the view that identity is formed by a predominantly political choice of certain characteristics. In so doing, it questions the idea that identity is a natural given, characterised by fixed, supposedly objective criteria. Both approaches need to be understood in their respective political and historical contexts, characterised by debate on issues of class, race and [[ethnicity]]. While they have been criticized, they continue to exert an influence on approaches to the conceptualisation of identity today.

These different explorations of 'identity' demonstrate how difficult a concept it is to pin down. Since identity is a virtual thing, it is impossible to define it empirically. Discussions of identity use the term with different meanings, from fundamental and abiding sameness, to fluidity, contingency, negotiated and so on. Brubaker and Cooper note a tendency in many scholars to confuse identity as a category of practice and as a category of analysis {{Harv|Brubaker|Cooper|2000|p=5}}. Indeed, many scholars demonstrate a tendency to follow their own preconceptions of identity, following more or less the frameworks listed above, rather than taking into account the mechanisms by which the concept is crystallised as reality. In this environment, some analysts, such as Brubaker and Cooper, have suggested doing away with the concept completely {{Harv|Brubaker|Cooper|2000|p=1}}. Others, by contrast, have sought to introduce alternative concepts in an attempt to capture the dynamic and fluid qualities of human social self-expression. Hall (1992, 1996), for example, suggests treating identity as a process, to take into account the reality of diverse and ever-changing social experience. Some scholars have introduced the idea of identification, whereby identity is perceived as made up of different components that are 'identified' and interpreted by individuals. The construction of an individual sense of self is achieved by personal choices regarding who and what to associate with. Such approaches are liberating in their recognition of the role of the individual in social interaction and the construction of identity.

Anthropologists have contributed to the debate by shifting the focus of research: One of the first challenges for the researcher wishing to carry out empirical research in this area is to identify an appropriate analytical tool. The concept of boundaries is useful here for demonstrating how identity works. In the same way as Barth, in his approach to ethnicity, advocated the critical focus for investigation as being "the ethnic boundary that defines the group rather than the cultural stuff that it encloses" (1969:15), social anthropologists such as Cohen and Bray have shifted the focus of analytical study from identity to the boundaries that are used for purposes of identification. If identity is a kind of virtual site in which the dynamic processes and markers used for identification are made apparent, boundaries provide the framework on which this virtual site is built.  They concentrated on how the idea of community belonging is differently constructed by individual members and how individuals within the group conceive ethnic boundaries.

As a non-directive and flexible analytical tool, the concept of boundaries helps both to map and to define the changeability and mutability that are characteristic of people's experiences of the self in society. While identity is a volatile, flexible and abstract 'thing', its manifestations and the ways in which it is exercised are often open to view. Identity is made evident through the use of markers such as [[language]], dress, [[behaviour]] and choice of space, whose effect depends on their recognition by other social beings. Markers help to create the boundaries that define similarities or differences between the marker wearer and the marker perceivers, their effectiveness depends on a shared understanding of their meaning. In a social context, misunderstandings can arise due to a misinterpretation of the significance of specific markers. Equally, an individual can use markers of identity to exert influence on other people without necessarily fulfilling all the criteria that an external observer might typically associate with such an [[abstract identity]].

Boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive depending on how they are perceived by other people. An exclusive boundary arises, for example, when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others. An inclusive boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages. Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not. Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity. But they might also perceive it as imposing an exclusive boundary that is meant to mark them off from her. On the other hand, those who do understand the newcomer's language could take it as an inclusive boundary, through which the newcomer associates herself with them to the exclusion of the other people present. Equally, however, it is possible that people who do understand the newcomer but who also speak another language may not want to speak the newcomer's language and so see her marker as an imposition and a negative boundary. It is possible that the newcomer is either aware or unaware of this, depending on whether she herself knows other languages or is conscious of the plurilingual quality of the people there and is respectful of it or not.

==In philosophy==
{{See also|Personal identity|Identity (philosophy)}}

[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] rejects Cartesian philosophy, supposing that we do not always doubt and that we do not always have consciousness. In his famous Master-Slave Dialectic Hegel attempts to show that the mind (''[[Geist]]'') only become conscious when it encounters another mind. One Geist attempts to control the other, since up until that point it has only encountered tools for its use. A struggle for domination ensues, leading to Lordship and Bondage.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], who was influenced by Hegel in some ways but rejected him in others, called for a rejection of "Soul Atomism" in [[The Gay Science]]. Nietzsche supposed that the Soul was an interaction of forces, an ever-changing thing far from the immortal soul posited by both Descartes and the Christian tradition. His "Construction of the Soul" in many ways resembles modern [[social constructivism]].

[[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], following Nietzsche, did work on identity. For Heidegger, people only really form an identity after facing death. It's death that allows people to choose from the social constructed meanings in their world, and assemble a finite identity out of seemingly infinite meanings. For Heidegger, most people never escape the "they", a socially constructed identity of "how one ought to be" created mostly to try to escape death through ambiguity.

Many philosophical schools derive from rejecting Hegel, and diverse traditions of acceptance and rejection have developed.

[[Paul Ricoeur|Ricoeur]] has introduced the distinction between the ipse identity ([[Self (psychology)|selfhood]], 'who am I?') and the idem identity ([[Identity (philosophy)|sameness]], or a third-person perspective which objectifies identity) {{Harv|Ricoeur|Blamey|1995}}.

==Implications==
The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now{{when|date=August 2015}} heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings. This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or "dirty work" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that "individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a "preferred organizational self" {{Harv|Tracy|Tretheway|2005|p=169}}. Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims. In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of "glorified maids" {{Harv|Tracy|Tretheway|2005}}. "The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices." Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life {{Harv|Tracy|Scott|2006|p=33}}. People in these types of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with. "Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one's work is considered "dirty" by societal standards" {{Harv|Tracy|Scott|2006|p=7}}. "In other words, doing taint management is not just about allowing the employee to feel good in that job. "If employees must navigate discourses that question the viability of their work, and/ or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming dirty work into a badge of honor, it is likely they will find blaming the client to be an efficacious route in affirming their identity" {{Harv|Tracy|Scott|2006|p=33}}.

In any case, the concept that an individual has a unique identity developed relatively recently in history. Factors influencing the emphasis on personal identity may include:

* in the West, the [[Protestant]] stress on one's [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] for one's own soul
* [[psychology]] itself, emerging as a distinct field of knowledge and study from the 19th century onwards
* the growth of a sense of [[privacy]] since the Renaissance
* specialization of worker roles during the industrial period (as opposed, for example, to the undifferentiated roles of peasants in the [[feudal]] system)
* occupation and employment's effect on identity{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}
* increased emphasis on gender identity, including [[gender dysphoria]] and [[transgender]] issues{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

===Identity changes===
An important implication relates to identity [[Change management|change]], i.e. the transformation of identity.

Contexts include:
* radical [[career]]-change {{Harv|Ibarra|2003}}
* [[gender identity]] transition
* national
* The practice of adoption

'''Jīvitindriya''' (Sanskrit and Pali) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "life faculty" or "vitality". ''Jīvitindriya'' is identified as one of the [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)#Seven_universal_mental_factors|seven universal mental factors]] within the Theravada abhidharma teachings. In this context, ''jīvitindriya'' is defined as a [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factor]] that sustains the life of the citta (mind) and other mental factors it accompanies. The  characteristic of jīvitindriya is said to be “ceaseless watching”.&lt;ref&gt;Gorkom (2010), p. 51 (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gorkom (2010), [http://www.zolag.co.uk/Cetasikas/html_node/Vitality-and-Attention.html Definition of jīvitindriya] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130505135429/http://www.zolag.co.uk/Cetasikas/html_node/Vitality-and-Attention.html |date=2013-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
===Theravada===
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:
:There are two kinds of life faculty, the mental, which vitalizes the associated mental states, and the physical, which vitalizes material phenomena. The mental life faculty alone is intended as a cetasika. It has the characteristic of maintaining the associated mental states, the function of making them occur, manifestation as the establishing of their presence, and its proximate cause is the mental states to be maintained. {{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2222-2224}}

===Mahayana===
Within the Mahayana Buddhist teachings, there are a variety of definitions for ''jīvitindriya''. The ''Dharmaskandhapadashastra'' (an early [[Abhidharma]] work of the Sarvastivadin school) defines ''jīvitindriya'' as: a faculty that persists, continues, maintains, animates, and operates what we called sentient beings.&lt;ref&gt;Soonil Hwang (2006), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Jīvitaṃ means “life”, and [[indriya]] means “controlling faculty”.

'''Katie Olivia Hopkins''' (born 13 February 1975) is an English media personality, columnist, radio presenter and businesswoman. She was a contestant in the [[The Apprentice (UK series three)|third series of ''The Apprentice'']] in 2007 and following further appearances in the media she became a [[columnist]] for British national newspapers. She began writing for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' in 2013&lt;ref name="Guardian311013"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/31/sun-katie-hopkins-daily-mail|title=Can the Sun's Katie Hopkins out-troll the Daily Mail?|work=The Guardian|date=31 October 2013|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Daily Mail]]''{{'}}s website ''[[MailOnline]]'' from 2015 to 2017.&lt;ref name="Mayhew271117"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mayhew|first=Freddy|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/katie-hopkins-leaves-mail-online-by-mutual-consent-as-column-is-axed-after-two-years/|title=Katie Hopkins leaves Mail Online by 'mutual consent' as column is axed after two years|work=Press Gazette|date=27 November 2017|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also been a presenter for the [[talk radio]] station [[LBC]]. 

Hopkins has been accused of [[racism]] by journalists, [[advocacy group]]s and politicians for her comments about [[Modern immigration to the United Kingdom|migrants]]. Her role at LBC was terminated in May 2017 following her comments on [[Twitter]] about the [[#Manchester Arena bombing|Manchester Arena bombing]].&lt;ref name="The Independent"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/kate-hopkins-lbc-radio-sacked-fired-manchester-attack-final-solution-daily-mail-muslims-racism-a7756776.html#gallery|title=Katie Hopkins to leave LBC 'immediately' in wake of Manchester attack 'final solution' comments|date=26 May 2017|work=The Independent|access-date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/23/manchester-attack-police-investigate-katie-hopkins-final-solution-tweet|title=Katie Hopkins reported to police after 'final solution' Manchester attack tweet|date=23 May 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, ''Mail Online'' was forced to pay £150,000 to a Muslim family whom Hopkins had falsely accused of [[Islamic extremism|extremist]] links. In a 2017 [[Defamation#England and Wales|libel]] case, Hopkins was required to pay £24,000 in [[damages]] and £107,000 in [[Costs in English law|legal costs]] to the left-wing writer [[Jack Monroe]] after making defamatory remarks on Twitter. Later in 2017, ''Mail Online'' was forced to pay substantial damages and legal costs to a teacher about whom Hopkins had made false claims. A day before, in late November, it had become known Hopkins' contract with the media outlet had not been renewed.&lt;ref name="Ruddick281117"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ruddick|first=Graham|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/28/mail-online-damages-teacher-katie-hopkins-column|title=Mail Online to pay damages to teacher over Katie Hopkins column|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 November 2017|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her final column was published on 5 October 2017.&lt;ref name="Ruddick271117"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ruddick|first=Graham|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/27/katie-hopkins-mail-online-column-contract-ends|title=Katie Hopkins' Mail Online contract ends 'by mutual consent'|work=The Guardian|date=27 November 2017|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She joined the Canadian [[far-right]] website [[The Rebel Media]] in January 2018.&lt;ref name="Ruddick"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ruddick|first=Graham|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/03/katie-hopkins-joins-far-right-canadian-website-rebel-media|title=Katie Hopkins joins far-right Canadian website Rebel Media|work=The Guardian|date=3 January 2018|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Katie Hopkins was born on 13 February 1975,&lt;ref name="birth"&gt;''Index of Births, Marriages and Deaths in England and Wales, 1837–1983.''&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Barnstaple]], Devon.&lt;ref name=grigg/&gt; Her father was an [[electrical engineer]] for the local Electricity Board and her mother was a bank teller. She has an older sister. She was raised in [[Bideford]],&lt;ref name="Thring"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bideford girl Katie Hopkins stars in Big Brother|url=http://www.northdevonjournal.co.uk/Bideford-girl-Katie-Hopkins-stars-Big-Brother/story-25853814-detail/story.html|accessdate=21 April 2015|work=North Devon Journal|date=14 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504125014/http://www.northdevonjournal.co.uk/Bideford-girl-Katie-Hopkins-stars-Big-Brother/story-25853814-detail/story.html|archivedate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; attended a private [[convent school]] from age 3 to 16, played sports and learned to play the piano and violin. As a child she believed she was "going to be the colonel of the forces. I loved the military. I loved the discipline, the rigour, the big shouty men."&lt;ref name="Aitkenhead"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aitkenhead|first=Decca|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/feb/14/katie-hopkins-interview|title=Katie Hopkins interview: 'Can you imagine the pent-up rage?'|work=The Guardian|date=14 February 2014|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins told [[Sathnam Sanghera]] of ''[[The Times]]'' in June 2015 that she applied to study [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE) at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. She passed the [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] entrance exam, but was rejected at the interview stage.&lt;ref name="Sanghera"/&gt; Disappointed, and putting the failure down to an absence of "a bit of coaching", she instead studied economics at the [[University of Exeter]]. She felt that her time at university was "redeemed" by her sponsorship from the [[British Army]]'s [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]], and spent her weekends with the [[Officers' Training Corps]].&lt;ref name="Sanghera"/&gt; This she found "really fun, lying around in forests with guns having a brilliant time".&lt;ref name="Aitkenhead"/&gt;

She completed her military training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]], but suffered an [[epilepsy|epileptic seizure]] during the final [[Passing out (military)|passing-out]] ceremony, and as a result was unable to take up her commission.&lt;ref name="Sanghera"/&gt; Hopkins said she kept her epilepsy secret whilst attending Sandhurst as this would have prevented her from being commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Katie Hopkins talking about her epilepsy|url=https://www.epilepsy.org.uk/news/katie-hopkins-talking-about-her-epilepsy|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=Epilepsy Today|date=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, she joined a business consultancy and moved to [[Manhattan]], New York City, before returning to the UK in 2005.&lt;ref name="Aitkenhead"/&gt; She joined the [[Met Office]] as a global brand consultant in September 2006.&lt;ref name=bbcmet/&gt;

Throughout her tenure on ''The Apprentice'', Hopkins made several critical comments on camera.

====Aftermath====
In June 2007, Hopkins lost her job at the Met Office, which said that she did not meet the required standards to complete her probationary period, and confirmed that her performance on ''The Apprentice'' and confessions about her private life were a factor in her dismissal.&lt;ref name="bbcmet" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0612/theapprentice.html |title=Katie Hopkins fired from real job |accessdate=15 June 2007 |publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929155515/http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0612/theapprentice.html |archivedate=29 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins later stated that the media were informed of her dismissal an hour after she was fired.&lt;ref name='GMTV'/&gt; After her appearance on ''The Apprentice'', Hopkins signed two deals to sell her story, one with the ''[[News of the World]]'' newspaper and the other with [[EMAP]], the company behind ''[[heat (magazine)|Heat]]'' and ''[[Grazia]]'' magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,2097757,00.html|title=Apprentice star signs News of the World deal|accessdate=15 June 2007|work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood | date=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins said in an interview with [[BBC Radio Kent]] that she had great respect for Sugar, and that she believed she would have won the programme had she been in the final episode. She also said that the media's attitudes towards her did not affect her but did affect her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/realmedia/audio/kents_best/thursday.ram|title=Katie Hopkins BBC Radio Kent Interview |accessdate=15 June 2007|publisher=BBC Radio Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made a similar claim of hypothetical victory in an interview with Fiona Phillips on the morning of the final ''Apprentice'' episode, although Sugar had said that if she wanted to press on he would fire her, whoever she was competing with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Katie Hopkins Interview|series=[[GMTV]]|station=[[ITV1]]|airdate=13 June 2007|season=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins told [[BBC Radio 1]] that she had not yet ruled out a media career&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/check/player/nol/newsid_6740000/newsid_6746800?redirect=6746827.stm&amp;news=1&amp;bbram=1&amp;bbwm=1&amp;nbram=1&amp;nbwm=1&amp;prefs=1 |title=Radio 1 Newsbeat – Katie Hopkins Interview |accessdate=15 June 2007 |publisher=BBC Radio 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but expressed interest in starting a business venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2007/06/13/katie_hopkins_apprentice_feature.shtml |title=What Katie did next... |accessdate=14 June 2007|publisher=BBC Berkshire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadcasting work===
After ''The Apprentice'', Hopkins appeared in an episode of ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats]]'', and was a guest star on ''[[Loose Women]]'' and ''[[The Friday Night Project]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geo.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/F/fnp/episodes/s5_ep4.html|title=Show Four: Melanie C |accessdate=7 August 2007|publisher=Channel 4}}{{dead link|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, she presented a ''Five Live Report'' on family life and working mothers for [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], and contributed an article on the same subject to [[BBC Online]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Katie |last=Hopkins |title=Gateway to the world feels just like a parish hall |url=http://www.thisisexeter.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=136993&amp;command=displayContent&amp;sourceNode=244961&amp;contentPK=17892541&amp;folderPk=113914&amp;pNodeId=244962 |publisher=Express and Echo |page=1 |date=21 July 2007 |accessdate=30 July 2007 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Hopkins joined the series ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK series 7)|I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/mar/21/the-apprentice-contestants|title=You're all fired|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Hazel|last=Davis|date=21 March 2009|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a replacement for [[Malcolm McLaren]], who dropped out just before the show started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2007/nov/14/watchwiththeprospectofsee|title=Watch with ... the prospect of seeing the famous eat grim things|first=Anna|last=Pickard|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 November 2007|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, she took part in the [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] reality series ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 15|Celebrity Big Brother]]'', finishing in second place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/30780350|title=Celebrity Big Brother gets 233 complaints about Ken Morley|publisher=BBC News|date=12 January 2015|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins has appeared twice on ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' in the editions of 10 June 2010 and 27 January 2011. She also appeared on the Young Voters' version of ''Question Time'' on 20 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/10_october/20/voters.shtml |title=Press Office – Young Voters' Question Time panel announced |publisher=BBC |date=20 October 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared on an episode of ''[[10 O'Clock Live]]'' on 24 April 2013 alongside [[Theo Paphitis]] and [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]] to discuss the legacy of the former British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] who had died that month, and to debate tax policies and the division of wealth amongst UK citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/10-oclock-live/episode-guide/series-3/episode-1 |title=Series 3, Episode 1, 10 O'Clock Live |publisher=Channel 4 |date=24 April 2013 |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, she deliberately gained and lost weight over the course of several months, in an attempt to show that obese people can diet successfully. Her progress was carefully documented by a camera crew and then played on a programme called ''My Fat Story'' for [[TLC (UK and Ireland)|TLC]].&lt;ref name=grigg&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/11317274/Katie-Hopkins-what-fat-people-need-is-a-kick-up-the-a-.html|title=Hopkins: what fat people need is a kick up the a--|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=8 January 2015|first=Casilda|last=Grigg|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins gained and lost {{convert|3|st|lb kg}} over the course of the programme.&lt;ref name=Lockhart&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/11316692/Katie-Hopkins-Im-still-the-biggest-bitch-in-Britain.html|title=Katie Hopkins: 'I'm still the biggest bitch in Britain'|first=Keely|last=Lockhart|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=6 February 2015|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; TLC claimed an audience figure of 10 million in the UK and US for the programme.&lt;ref name="Sweney181215"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/dec/18/katie-hopkins-tv-chat-show-axed|title=Katie Hopkins' TV chatshow axed|work=The Guardian|date=18 December 2015|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, she began her own chat show, ''[[If Katie Hopkins Ruled the World]]'' on the digital channel [[TLC (UK and Ireland)|TLC]]. She said she wanted to bring a new variation to chat and panel shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/06/if-katie-hopkins-ruled-the-world-tv-show-daily-mail-liz-jones|title=Katie Hopkins' TV show: 'I’m not playing the part of a pantomime villain’|first=Tara|last=Conlan|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 August 2015|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was dropped in December, after the first series, owing to low audience ratings.&lt;ref name="Sweney181215"/&gt;

From April 2016 to May 2017, Hopkins presented a [[Sunday morning talk show]] on [[LBC]], a London-based national talk and phone-in radio station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Verdier|first=Hannah|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/14/katie-hopkins-lbc-show-review-controversy-washed-down-with-offence|title=The Katie Hopkins LBC show review: controversy washed down with offence|work=The Guardian|date=14 April 2016|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had previously worked as a guest presenter for the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rea |first=James |url=http://www.lbc.co.uk/katie-hopkins-and-andrew-castle-get-lbc-shows-128025 |title=Katie Hopkins And Andrew Castle Get LBC Shows |publisher=LBC |date=4 April 2016 |accessdate=4 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407040126/http://www.lbc.co.uk/katie-hopkins-and-andrew-castle-get-lbc-shows-128025 |archivedate=7 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=John|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/04/katie-hopkins-lbc-radio-show|title=Katie Hopkins to host LBC radio show|work=The Guardian|date=4 April 2016|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The snarling facade remained", wrote Fiona Sturges for ''[[The Independent]]'' in April 2015 after one such broadcast.

Hopkins said she is "pushing back the walls closing in on freedom of speech" at a Church and Media conference in October 2015. Claiming to be "the new Jesus" during her speech, she said: "I have never apologised for anything I’ve said. I find it very disappointing when people apologise. You should have the positive moral attitude to stand by what you say".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/13/im-the-new-jesus-katie-hopkins-tells-church-conference|title=I'm the new Jesus, Katie Hopkins tells church conference|work=The Guardian|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite news|last=Powell|first=Emma|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/katie-hopkins-says-she-is-the-new-jesus-and-refuses-to-apologise-for-controversial-comments-a3089916.html|title=Katie Hopkins says she is the 'new Jesus' – and refuses to apologise for controversial comments|work=London Evening Standard|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Print and websites===
Early in her public career, Hopkins wrote a column for Exeter's ''[[Express &amp; Echo]]'' newspaper, but her articles ceased after an online poll in October 2007 found 84% of readers wanted the feature to end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/7037846.stm|title=Apprentice Katie is 'fired' again|publisher=BBC News|date=10 October 2007|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of October 2013, it emerged that Hopkins had joined ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' as a weekly columnist.&lt;ref name="Guardian311013"/&gt; with the newspaper promoting her as "Britain's most controversial columnist".&lt;ref name="Dearden010815"/&gt; Hopkins in February 2015 defended her remarks and those of her critics, commenting: "I welcome it because I've had my opinion and it's only right that people have theirs. I welcome the debate and the fact that people are getting involved."&lt;ref name=Lockhart/&gt;

She left ''The Sun'' for the [[Mail Online]] website, the online companion to the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in autumn 2015.&lt;ref name="Sweney240915"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/24/katie-hopkins-leaves-the-sun-to-join-mail-online|title=Katie Hopkins leaves the Sun to join Mail Online|work=The Guardian|date=24 September 2015|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' contributor [[Bryony Gordon]] wrote in April 2015 that media organisations have "a tipping point here, where the marketing men and women don't want to be associated with reality TV's very own Adolf Hitler.

and also referred to Hopkins. It "was a lie" to say Hopkins wrote for the ''Daily Mail'', it asserted.

A large number of Tweets from her Twitter account were deleted around the same time.&lt;ref name="Mayhew271117"/&gt;

A few days before, a video was posted online of Hopkins' appearance at the [[David Horowitz Freedom Center]] in Florida earlier in November 2017. "It's such a pleasure to be amongst people that are prepared to fight for their country" she said, asserting it is "our time". She continued: "We can commit to arm ourselves, not just with the help of the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]]".&lt;ref name="Dearden271117"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dearden|first=Lizzie|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/katie-hopkins-muslims-far-right-speech-mailonline-racism-islamophobia-david-horowitz-freedom-center-a8078356.html|title=Katie Hopkins gave speech attacking Muslims to far-right group days before leaving Mail Online 'by mutual consent'|work=The Independent|date=27 November 2017|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her opinion, there is a "Muslim mafia" in certain areas of Britain and "institutionalised discrimination against whites" in the UK as a whole.&lt;ref name="Dearden271117"/&gt;

In January 2018, Hopkins joined [[The Rebel Media]], a Canadian far-right website, on which [[Tommy Robinson (activist)|Tommy Robinson]], founder of the [[English Defence League]], is also a contributor.&lt;ref name="Ruddick"/&gt; In her first column on her own Hopkins World outlet, she wrote: "When so many platforms are under the control of the Saudis, tied to fickle commercial advertisers or beholden to special interests and religious lobbyists, it is a real thrill to find a place for us to speak without censorship".&lt;ref name="Ruddick"/&gt;

===Multiculturalism===
Hopkins is [[anti-multiculturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/katie-hopkins-multiculturalism-means-that-we-all-die-together/ |title=Katie Hopkins: ‘Multiculturalism Means That We All Die Together’ |date=2 April 2018 |publisher=[[Right Wing Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referencing a so-called "multicultural mafia",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/12/katie-hopkins-appearance-on-late-late-show-draws-hundreds-of-com/ |title=Katie Hopkins' appearance on Late Late Show draws hundreds of complaints |date=12 November 2016 |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/rt%C3%A9-receives-1-300-complaints-over-katie-hopkins-interview-1.2864436 |title=RTÉ receives 1,300 complaints over Katie Hopkins interview |date=11 November 2016 |publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; she has claimed that increased crime is directly linked to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/katie-hopkins-attacks-hull-again-837217 |title=Katie Hopkins attacks Hull again - and people really aren't happy |date=28 November 2017 |publisher=''[[Hull Daily Mail]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticising [[Notting Hill Carnival]] in 2016, she said "I don't buy multiculturalism at all", claiming that a "London bubble" believed in it and "the liberal left wing press, the [[BBC]], they love it!

===White genocide===
Hopkins pushes the [[white genocide conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=This far-right online campaign has found an ally in the Trump administration |url=https://www.mediamatters.org/people/katie-hopkins |publisher=[[Media Matters]] |date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump Is Tweeting About White Farmers in South Africa.

==Controversies==

Since ''The Apprentice'', Hopkins has frequently featured in the media for making controversial remarks, being described in several media outlets as a "professional [[internet troll|troll]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/19/friday-2-januarys-best-tv|title=Friday 2nd January's Best TV|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 December 2014|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/12/02/katie-hopkins-gets-slayed-twitter-x-factor-stereo-kicks-singer-tom-mann_n_6253542.html|title=Katie Hopkins Gets Slayed on Twitter By X Factor Stereo Kicks Singer Tom Mann|work=HuffPost|date=2 December 2014|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/stereo-kicks/news/stereo-kicks-burn-katie-hopkins-on-twitter|title=Stereo Kicks Burn Katie Hopkins on Twitter|publisher=MTV|date=2 December 2014|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has described herself as a "conduit for truth", declaring what other people think but are too scared to say.&lt;ref name="Usborne2014"&gt;{{cite news|last=Usborne|first=Simon|title=A day with Katie Hopkins: Separating the Apprentice 'superbitch' from her soundbites|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/a-day-with-katie-hopkins-separating-the-apprentice-superbitch-from-her-soundbites-8706555.html|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=Independent|date=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social class===
During an appearance on [[ITV Network|ITV's]] ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'' in July 2013, Hopkins revealed she would stop her children playing with their classmates based on their [[given name]]s. She revealed a particular dislike for "lower class" names like Charmaine, Chantelle, and [[Chardonnay (name)|Chardonnay]], which met with disapproval from co-host [[Holly Willoughby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wallwork|first=Ellen|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/09/30/holly-willoughby-baby-name-katie-hopkins-teases-they-clearly-had-sex-in-chester_n_7321976.html|title=Holly Willoughby Baby Name: Katie Hopkins Teases 'They Clearly Had Sex In Chester'|work=HuffPost|date=30 September 2014|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins said that she did not like "geographical location names" either. After Willoughby's colleague, [[Phillip Schofield]], pointed out that she had given the name [[India (given name)|India]] to one of her daughters, Hopkins asserted that India is "not related to a place".&lt;ref name="Battersby"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/katie-hopkins-branded-an-insufferable-snob-after-this-morning-debate-on-childrens-names-8690468.html|title=Katie Hopkins branded an 'insufferable snob' after This Morning debate on children's names|first=Matilda|last=Battersby|date=5 July 2013|accessdate=9 July 2013|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A viewers' poll conducted by the ''This Morning'' programme indicated that 91% of respondents disagreed with Hopkins' opinion.&lt;ref name="Battersby"/&gt;

Appearing as a panellist on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]'s ''[[The Big Benefits Row: Live]]'' in February 2014, she was accused by [[Terry Christian]] amongst others of only expressing her controversial opinions to make money from media appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/02/04/katie-hopkins-annabel-giles-the-big-benefits-row-channel-5_n_4721468.html|title=Katie Hopkins Comes To Blows With Annabel Giles On 'The Big Benefits Row'|work=Huffington Post|date=4 February 2014|first=Ashley|last=Percival|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins has said that financial motives are not the reason she speaks out, and received a "relatively modest" fee of £300 when she was on ''This Morning'' speaking about children's names.&lt;ref name="Usborne2014"/&gt;

In a February 2014 interview with [[Decca Aitkenhead]] for ''The Guardian'', Hopkins was asked if she is a snob: "Oh, definitely yeah, 100%. I think it's really important to be snobby".&lt;ref name="Aitkenhead"/&gt;

===Illness and fatalities in the UK===
Hopkins posted a tweet referring to Scottish [[life expectancy]] predictions based upon a 2011 [[NHS Scotland]] report, "Healthy Life Expectancy in Scotland: Update of trends to 2010". This tweet was posted following a heated debate on Scottish Independence during an edition of  ''[[The Wright Stuff]]'' on which Hopkins was a panellist. In the wake of the [[2013 Glasgow helicopter crash]], the tweet raised widespread condemnation among Twitter users. Hopkins retorted "Following Independence I will only be the Biggest Bitch in England", and described people's reactions as "[[political correctness|PC]] tastic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/02/katie-hopkins-twitter-glasgow-helicopter-crash-apprentice|title=Katie Hopkins apologises for timing of tweet about Scottish life expectancy|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 December 2013|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online petition to ban Hopkins from shows such as ITV's ''This Morning'' and ''The Wright Stuff'' on Channel 5 gained over 75,000 signatures. Hopkins issued an apology the following Monday, restating that her original remark was in reference to the NHS report and was simply bad timing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baird|first=Dugald|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/03/katie-hopkins-petition-scotland-glasgow-twitter|title=Katie Hopkins petition passes 75,000 as she explains life expectancy tweet|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 December 2013|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ITV said on 5 December 2013 that "We have no plans for Katie Hopkins to appear on ''This Morning'' at this present time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blundy|first=Rachel|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/celebritynews/katie-hopkins-dropped-from-this-morning-after-thousands-sign-petition-in-wake-of-ill-timed-scotland-8983264.html|title=Katie Hopkins 'dropped' from This Morning after thousands sign petition in wake of ill-timed Scotland tweet|work=London Evening Standard|date=5 December 2013|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December 2014, police announced they were investigating complaints they had received concerning Hopkins' tweets about [[Ebola virus disease in the United Kingdom#2014 returning aid worker|Pauline Cafferkey]], a Scottish aid worker who was diagnosed with [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] after returning to the UK from [[Sierra Leone]]. Hopkins had tweeted: "Little sweaty jocks, sending us Ebola bombs in the form of sweaty Glaswegians just isn't cricket. Scottish NHS sucks."&lt;ref name=bbc_ebola&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-30641705| title = Katie Hopkins' tweets on 'Ebola bombs' examined by police| date = 31 December 2014| accessdate = 3 January 2015| publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; No evidence of criminality was found by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No charges over Katie Hopkins' tweets on 'sweaty jocks'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-32945786|accessdate=30 May 2015|date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 April 2015, Hopkins made a series of tweets suggesting that people with [[dementia]] are "bed blockers" who take up scarce hospital beds and implied they would be better off dead. Her comments were condemned by leading UK Alzheimer's charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11520748/Katie-Hopkins-slurs-on-dementia-patients-provoke-anger-from-charities.html|title = Katie Hopkins' slurs on dementia patients provoke anger from charities|last = Donnelly|first = Laura|date = 7 April 2015|work = The Daily Telegraph|access-date = 8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After five Londoners drowned at [[Camber Sands]] in August 2016, Hopkins tweeted a poll mocking the identities of the deceased.&lt;ref name="Blair250816"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/katie-hopkins-twitter-camber-sands-death-poll-police-report-a7209081.html|title=Katie Hopkins reported to Twitter by police over Camber Sands deaths poll|work=[[The Independent]]|first=Olivia|last=Blair|date=25 August 2016|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sussex Police]] reported the tweet to Twitter under the headings of "abusive or harmful" and "disrespectful or offensive".&lt;ref name="Blair250816"/&gt; They decided while the tweet was distasteful it was not criminal.&lt;ref name="Blair250816"/&gt; The tweet was deleted.&lt;ref name="Blair250816"/&gt;

===Pakistani men and Rochdale===
Hopkins objected to Rochdale commemorating National Pakistan Day on 23 March 2015 and claimed to base her objection on a [[Rochdale sex trafficking gang|Rochdale sex trafficking case]] involving nine predominantly Pakistani men and forty-seven white victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/29/katie-hopkins-reported-police-race-hate-rochdale-pakistani-sex-abuse|title=Katie Hopkins accused of race hate by linking Pakistani men with sex abuse|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 March 2015|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of tweets, she posted images of the felons with the caption "are these your friends too?" On 29 March 2015, Hopkins was reported to the police by Labour MP [[Simon Danczuk]] for possible race hate crimes.&lt;ref name=Rochdale1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/32112029/katie-hopkins-reported-to-police-for-race-hate-by-politician|title=Katie Hopkins reported to police for race hate by politician|publisher=BBC News|date=30 March 2015|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Hopkins said "I asked fair questions and I think it's important that someone has the balls to speak out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/katie-hopkins-accuses-labour-mp-simon-danczuk-of-reporting-her-to-the-police-to-divert-attention-away-from-his-porn-habit-10148144.html|title=Katie Hopkins accuses Labour MP Simon Danczuk of reporting her to the police to divert attention away from his porn habit|first=Jenn|last=Selby|newspaper=The Independent|date=1 April 2015|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migrants===
On 17 April 2015, Hopkins wrote a column in ''The Sun'' in  comparing migrants to "cockroaches" and "feral humans" and said they were "spreading like the norovirus". She wrote that gunships should be used to stop migrants from crossing the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=John|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/20/katie-hopkins-sun-migrants-article-petition-nears-180000-mark|title=Katie Hopkins compares migrants to 'cockroaches' and suggests using gunships to stop them crossing the Mediterranean|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 April 2015|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITV180415"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2015-04-18/katie-hopkins-compares-migrants-to-cockroaches-and-suggests-using-gunships-to-stop-them-crossing-the-mediterranean/|title=Katie Hopkins compares migrants to 'cockroaches' and suggests using gunships to stop them crossing the Mediterranean|publisher=[[ITV News]]|date=18 April 2015|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gander"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gander|first=Kashmira|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/hateful-katie-hopkins-column-on-migrants-causes-twitter-backlash-as-russell-brand-wades-into-debate-10186342.html|title='Hateful' Katie Hopkins column on migrants causes Twitter backlash, as Russell Brand wades into debate|work=[[The Independent]]|date=17 April 2015|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her remarks were condemned by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commission for Human Rights]], [[Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad|Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein]].&lt;ref name="Stone240415"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stone|first=Jon|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/katie-hopkins-migrant-cockroaches-column-resembles-progenocide-propaganda-says-the-un-10201959.html|title=Katie Hopkins' migrant 'cockroaches' column resembles pro-genocide propaganda, says the UN|work=The Independent|date=24 April 2015|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement released on 24 April 2015, he urged the UK to "curb incitement to hatred" by its "tabloid newspapers" and stated that Hopkins used "language very similar to that employed by Rwanda's ''[[Kangura]]'' newspaper and [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines|Radio Mille Collines]] during the run up to the [[Rwandan Genocide|1994 genocide]]", and noted that both media organisations were subsequently convicted by an international tribunal of public incitement to commit [[genocide]].&lt;ref name="Stone240415"/&gt;

Hopkins' column also drew criticism on Twitter, including from [[Russell Brand]], to whom Hopkins responded by accusing Brand's "[[champagne socialist]] humanity" of neglecting taxpayers.&lt;ref name="Gander"/&gt; Simon Usborne, writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', compared her use of the word "cockroach" to previous uses by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and just before the [[Rwandan Genocide]] by its perpetrators.&lt;ref name="Usborne2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/katie-hopkins-when-is-enough-enough-10186490.html|title=Katie Hopkins has just written a piece so hateful that it might give Hitler pause – why was it published?|work=The Independent|last=Usborne|first=Simon|date=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suspected that if any other contributor had written the piece it would not have been published and questioned her continued employment by the newspaper.&lt;ref name="Usborne2015"/&gt; [[Zoe Williams]] commented in ''[[The Guardian]]'': "It is no joke when people start talking like this.

A [[Change.org]] petition was initiated with the aim of getting ''The Sun'' to sack Hopkins. By 26 April, it had attracted over 310,000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The migrant petition that's not about Katie Hopkins|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-32395272|accessdate=21 April 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early September, ''The Sun'' retweeted an earlier comment from Hopkins expressing her disinterest in migrants.

Peter Herbert, chair of the Society of Black Lawyers, reported Hopkins and ''The Sun'' to Sir [[Bernard Hogan-Howe]], the [[Metropolitan Police]] Commissioner. Hopkins was questioned and not charged, and subsequently criticised the police for purportedly criminalising opinion, and stated that she would set up a Society of White Lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saul|first1=Heather|title=Katie Hopkins tweets about 'setting up society for white lawyers' after Met Police decide against charging her over allegations of inciting racial hatred|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/katie-hopkins-tweets-about-setting-up-society-for-white-lawyers-after-met-police-decide-against-a6720436.html|accessdate=5 November 2015|work=The Independent|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2016, the original article had been removed from ''The Sun''{{'}}s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://politicalscrapbook.net/2016/12/the-sun-deletes-katie-hopkins-article-calling-refugees-cockroaches-after-stop-funding-hate-campaign/|title=''The Sun'' Deletes Katie Hopkins' Article Calling Refugees 'Cockroaches' After Stop Funding Hate Campaign|work=Political Scrapbook|date=14 December 2016|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donald Trump===
Hopkins supported [[Donald Trump]]'s Republican presidential nomination in the ''Daily Mail'' during December: "I hear cries that he is a blithering idiot. I have often been called a deranged fool. But if this were true you could ignore me, ignore us, {{sic|imaging}} the two of us shouting naked at the rain. It's because we articulate sentiments repressed by the politically correct consensus that we have a voice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2015/12/world-ends-donald-trump-discovers-respected-columnist-katie-hopkins-supports|title=World ends as Donald Trump discovers 'respected columnist' Katie Hopkins supports him|work=New Statesman|date=10 December 2016|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins defended Trump's [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump#Proposed Muslim immigration ban|remarks that all Muslims should be banned from entering the United States]].

===Racism, racial profiling, and Black Lives Matter===
In January 2017, a caller to her LBC programme named Joseph said she came over as racist, following which she said: "I genuinely believe 'racist' as a word has been used so much. I am sorry for the word racist in a way. I love language so much&amp;nbsp;... it's like a regular word now, it's lost all meaning to me". When tweeting the clip she added, "Call me racist. I don't care. I will stand up for white women being raped because you're scared to offend Muslims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chandler|first=Mark|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/outrage-as-katie-hopkins-shares-neonazi-praise-after-racism-debate-a3430926.html|title=Outrage as Katie Hopkins shares neo-Nazi praise after 'racism' debate|work=London Evening Standard|date=2 January 2017|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins tweeted shortly afterwards: "Racial profiling is a good thing, call me racist. I don't care...it has lost all meaning". She later briefly retweeted a favourable response from an account named Anti Juden SS, whose avatar featured the [[Nazi swastika|Swastika]] (and the United States flag), later explaining that she had not looked at the handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Demianyk|first=Graeme|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/katie-hopkins-tweet-racist-neo-nazi_uk_586a91a3e4b0f24da6e93af7|title=Katie Hopkins Shares 'Neo-Nazi' Praise After Claiming 'Racism Has Lost All Meaning'|work=HuffPost|date=3 January 2017|accessdate=23 May 2017}} The ellipsis is in Hopkins' original tweet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gold|first=Tanya|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/01/press-regulation-will-be-a-boon-to-anti-journalists-like-katie-hopkins/#|title=Press regulation will be a boon to anti-journalists like Katie Hopkins|work=The Spectator|date=7 January 2017|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharing a poster on Twitter for the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Dear White People (TV series)|Dear White People]]'' at the beginning of May 2017, Hopkins added: "Dear black people. If your lives matter why do you stab and shoot each other so much". Although, the tweet was deleted, users of the social media site circulated screenshots of what appeared to be a reference to the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stolworthy|first=Jacob|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/katie-hopkins-dear-white-people-netflix-series-black-lives-matter-racist-tweet-a7713646.html|title=Katie Hopkins accused of racism after Dear White People tweet|work=The Independent|date=2 May 2017|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, she urged the London Mayor [[Sadiq Khan]] to use [[Water cannon#United Kingdom|water cannon]] against Black Lives Matter protesters at [[Heathrow Airport]], who had chained themselves to the tarmac of an approach road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chandler|first=Mark|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/black-lives-matter-katie-hopkins-causes-outrage-after-calling-for-water-cannon-to-be-used-against-a3313331.html|title=Black Lives Matter: Katie Hopkins causes outrage after calling for water cannon to be used against Heathrow protesters|work=London Evening Standard|date=5 August 2016|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor}}Manchester Arena bombing===
Regarding the Manchester Arena bombing, Hopkins wrote that "Britain is faced with some hard questions the people charged with protecting us are going to have to answer sooner or later". Hopkins asserted that the suicide bomber, Salman Abedi, was known to the police, and questioned how he was permitted to re-enter Britain unchallenged after visiting Libya.  "Our leaders allow such deeply suspicious characters back into Britain," wrote Hopkins, "and then expect us to swallow their lies that we will not give in to terror?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hopkins | first = Katie | date = 24 May 2017 | title = The Politicians Now Have Hundreds of Troops Protecting Them While Telling The Rest of Us To Keep Calm, Stay 'United' And Carry On.

The journalist [[Nick Cohen]] was among those who responded on Twitter: "Even if Hopkins knows nothing of Nazism – which I doubt – her "final solution" can only mean [[ethnic cleansing]]". Others, such as [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]], called for a boycott of the LBC radio station while they employ her.&lt;ref name="Nelson230517"/&gt; Interviewed later on Fox News by [[Tucker Carlson]], she called for people to insist on deportations among other responses to terrorist acts. She said: "I used the word 'final solution' in a tweet, and I would not in any way want to use that term and the inference other people lay on that. What I meant was, we need a lasting solution, a resolution to this".&lt;ref name="Hawkins"/&gt;&lt;!-- Main passage on her LBC sacking is in 'Subsequent broadcasting work'.

Following the [[2017 London Bridge attack|June 2017 London Bridge attack]] almost a fortnight later, Hopkins called for [[internment|internment camps]] to be used for those suspected of being Muslim extremists on Fox News' ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]]''. The host [[Clayton Morris]] said, on behalf of the network staff, that everyone considered the "idea reprehensible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McDonald|first=Karl|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/fox-news-distances-itself-from-farage-and-hopkins-internment-demands-1-4466308?fff|title=Fox News distances itself from Farage and Hopkins internment demands|work=The Scotsman|agency=Inews|date=5 June 2017|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fang|first=Marina|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-news-london-attack_us_59343347e4b075bff0f475f8|title=Fox News Host Disavows Internment Camps, After Panelists Suggest Rounding Up Muslims|work=HuffPost|date=4 June 2017|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppenheim|first=Maya|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/fox-news-katie-hopkins-internment-camp-london-attack-terror-stabbing-muslims-islam-a7775026.html|title=Fox News calls Katie Hopkins' internment camp remarks 'reprehensible'|work=The Independent|date=6 June 2017|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins' comments have been linked in the media with [[hate crimes]] against Muslims. A Muslim man in [[Heckmondwike]] stated that he was attacked by assailants who graffitied his house with Hopkins' tweet, including her misspelling "#Machester".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Finnegan|first1=Stephanie|title=Muslim man attacked by thugs who then vandalised his home quoting a racist Katie Hopkins tweet|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/muslim-man-attacked-thugs-who-13237258|accessdate=26 June 2017|work=Manchester Evening News|date=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refugees and migrants in the Mediterranean===
In July 2017, Hopkins flew to [[Catania]] in Sicily to visit a ship known as the C-Star hired by the [[Identitarian movement#In Europe|Defend Europe]] movement, which has the intention of hindering the work of "search and rescue" vessels in the Mediterranean used by charities such as [[Save the Children]] to save trafficked migrants and refugees.&lt;ref name="Oppenheim"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppenheimn|first=Maya|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/katie-hopkins-defend-europe-meeting-far-right-activists-c-star-ship-anti-immigrant-mediterranean-a7857911.html|title=Katie Hopkins branded 'PR machine for extremists' after meeting group aiming to hamper refugee rescues in Med|work=The Independent|date=24 July 2017|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defend Europe is supported by the American white-nationalist [[David Duke]] and the neo-Nazi ''[[The Daily Stormer|Daily Stormer]]'' website.&lt;ref name="Mulhall"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulhall|first=Joe|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/21/katie-hopkins-boat-far-right-activists-sicily-migrants|title=Why has Katie Hopkins set sail with a bunch of far-right activists?|work=The Guardian|date=21 July 2017|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins tweets suggested she was actively supporting Defend Europe, rather than covering the subject for her employer: "Looking forward to meeting the crew of the C-Star in Catania tomorrow.

In November 2017, Hopkins' former employers [[Mail Online]] apologised and paid "substantial damages" to teacher Jackie Teale, after Hopkins had made false accusations of taking her class to a [[Donald Trump]] protest in Westminster.&lt;ref name="Ruddick281117"/&gt;

===Daily Mirror===

In May 2018, Hopkins won an [[Independent Press Standards Organisation|IPSO]] case against the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' for claiming that she had been detained in South Africa in February 2018 for taking [[ketamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new|last=Embury-Dennis|first=Tom|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/katie-hopkins-daily-mirror-south-africa-headline-drug-racism-ipso-complaint-a8367581.html|title=Katie Hopkins wins IPSO case against Daily Mirror for claiming she was detained for drugs rather than 'spreading racial hatred'|work=The Independent|date=25 May 2018|access-date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mirror'' updated the headline to say that she had been detained for spreading racial hatred, and included a correction in the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Saunders|first=Emmeline|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/katie-hopkins-detained-south-africa-11977548|title=Katie Hopkins DETAINED in South Africa for 'spreading racial hatred' after taking ketamine while collapsed in the street|work=The Mirror|date=6 February 2018|access-date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==
In the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 European Parliament Election]], Hopkins stood as a candidate for the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England Constituency]] as an [[Independent politician|Independent]] candidate. She polled 8,971 votes or 0.6% of the total votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/elections/euro/09/html/ukregion_36.stm |title=European Election 2009 &amp;#124; South West |publisher=BBC News |date=8 June 2009 |accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apprentice villain Katie Hopkins standing for Euro election|url=http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Apprentice-villain-Katie-Hopkins-standing-Euro-election/story-12300046-detail/story.html|accessdate=21 April 2015|work=Western Daily Press|date=11 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111180920/http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Apprentice-villain-Katie-Hopkins-standing-Euro-election/story-12300046-detail/story.html|archivedate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late September 2015, Hopkins spoke at a fringe event organised by the [[Electoral Reform Society]] at the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP)'s annual conference. After derogatory comments about the appointment of [[Michelle Mone]] to the [[House of Lords]], she said: "Frankly, I don't really mind if we seal up the room and gas the lot of them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=Jasper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/25/katie-hopkins-wouldnt-mind-if-house-of-lords-was-sealed-up-and-gassed|title=Katie Hopkins 'wouldn't mind' if House of Lords was sealed up and gassed|work=The Guardian|date=25 September 2015|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UKIP said Hopkins was not a party member and, although she has reportedly applied to join on several occasions, her applications have always been rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Payne|first=Sebastian|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/09/watch-ukip-supporter-katie-hopkins-advocates-gassing-the-house-of-lords/|title=Watch: Ukip supporter Katie Hopkins advocates gassing the House of Lords|work=The Spectator (Coffee House blog)|date=25 September 2015|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Level of invention''' (or ''degree of inventiveness'', or ''level of solution'', or ''rank of solution'', or ''rank of invention'') is a [[comparative|relative degree]] of changes to the previous [[system]] (or solution) in the result of solution of [[inventive problem]] (one containing a [[contradiction]]). Term was defined and introduced by [[TRIZ]] author [[G. S. Altshuller]].

After initially reviewing 200,000 patent abstracts, Altshuller selected 40,000 as representatives of high level inventive solutions. The remainder involved direct improvements easily recognized within the specialty of the system.

Altshuller separated the patents' different degrees of [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|inventiveness]] into five levels:
* Level 1 – Routine design problems solved by methods well known within the specialty. Usually no invention needed. 
:example: use of coal for writing
* Level 2 – Minor improvements to an existing system using methods known within the industry. 
:example: graphite [[pencil]] (wrapped coal stick)
* Level 3 – Fundamental improvement to an existing system using methods known outside the industry. 
:example: ink [[pen]] (ink instead of coal)
* Level 4 – A new generation of a system that entails a new principle for performing the system's primary functions. Solutions are found more often in science than technology. 
:example: [[Computer printer|printer]] (another whole system for writing)
* Level 5 – A rare scientific discovery or pioneering invention of an essentially new system. 
:example: electronic pen&amp;paper (see [http://www.anoto.com Anoto])

These levels of invention are applied to solutions rather than problems requiring a system of solution.

Also '''level of invention''' and the '''potential for innovation''' in any nation, geographical area or economic activity is as measurement in the concept of ''[[innovative capacity]]'' originally introduced by Prof. Suarez-Villa in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.innovativecapacity.com/publications-LSV.htm |title=publications-LSV |first=Luis |last=Suarez-Villa |work=innovativecapacity.com |year=2011 |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lingchi''''' ({{zh|t=凌遲}}), translated variously as the '''slow process''', the '''lingering death''', or '''slow slicing''', and also known as '''death by a thousand cuts''', was a form of torture and [[execution]] used in [[China]] from roughly 900 CE until it was banned in 1905. It was also used in [[Vietnam]]. In this form of execution, a knife was used to methodically remove portions of the body over an extended period of time, eventually resulting in death.

''Lingchi'' was reserved for crimes viewed as especially severe, such as treason. Some Westerners were executed in this manner. Even after the practice was outlawed, the concept itself has still appeared across many types of media.

== Etymology ==
The term ''lingchi'' first appeared in a line in Chapter 28 of the classical philosophical text ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]''. The line originally described the difficulty in travelling in a horse-drawn carriage on mountainous terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Xun|first1=Kuang|authorlink1=Xun Kuang|title=Xunzi|date=3rd century BCE|location=China|chapter=28|quote=三尺之岸而虛車不能登也，百仞之山任負車登焉，何則？陵遲故也。|url=http://ctext.org/xunzi/you-zuo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, it was used to describe the prolonging of a person's agony when the person is being killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shen|first1=Jiaben|title=历代刑法考 [Research on Judicial Punishments over the Dynasties]|date=2006|publisher=[[Zhonghua Book Company]]|location=China|isbn=9787101014631|url=https://book.douban.com/subject/1944166/|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The process involved tying the condemned prisoner to a wooden frame, usually in a public place. The flesh was then cut from the body in multiple slices in a process that was not specified in detail in Chinese law, and therefore most likely varied. The punishment worked on three levels: as a form of public humiliation, as a slow and lingering death, and as a punishment after death.

According to the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] principle of [[filial piety]], to alter one's body or to cut the body are considered unfilial practices. ''Lingchi'' therefore contravenes the demands of filial piety. In addition, to be cut to pieces meant that the body of the victim would not be "whole" in spiritual life after death.

''Lingchi'' could be used for the torture and execution of a living person, or applied as an act of humiliation after death. It was meted out for major offences such as [[high treason]], [[mass murder]], [[patricide]]/[[matricide]] or the murder of one's master or employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=zh:清李毓昌命案 于保业|trans-title=The Qing Dynasty Case of Li Yuchang|url=http://www.jimo.gov.cn/jmwenhuaju/inc/list.asp?id=16991&amp;webid=171|language=Chinese|date=2006|location=[[Jimo]]|publisher=Jimo Cultural Network|accessdate=25 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805150939/http://www.jimo.gov.cn/jmwenhuaju/inc/list.asp?id=16991&amp;webid=171|archivedate=5 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emperors used it to threaten people and sometimes ordered it for minor offences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hongwu Emperor]].

While it is difficult to obtain accurate details of how the executions took place, they generally consisted of cuts to the arms, legs, and chest leading to amputation of limbs, followed by decapitation or a stab to the heart. If the crime was less serious or the executioner merciful, the first cut would be to the throat causing death; subsequent cuts served solely to dismember the corpse.

Art historian [[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]] argues that extant photos of the execution clearly show that the "death by division" (as it was termed by German criminologist {{Interlanguage link multi|Robert Heindl|de}}) involved some degree of [[dismemberment]] while the subject was living.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James, ''The Object Stares Back: On the Nature of Seeing'', New York: Simon and Schuster, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Elkins also argues that, contrary to the apocryphal version of "death by a thousand cuts", the actual process could not have lasted long. The condemned individual is not likely to have remained conscious and aware (if even alive) after one or two severe wounds, so the entire process could not have included more than a "few dozen" wounds.

In the [[Yuan dynasty]], 100 cuts were inflicted&lt;ref&gt;[[Guan Hanqing|Guan, Hanqing]]. ''[[The Injustice to Dou E]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; but by the [[Ming dynasty]] there were records of 3,000 incisions.&lt;ref&gt;Deng, Zhicheng (鄧之誠).

==Western perceptions==
The Western perception of ''lingchi'' has often differed considerably from the actual practice, and some misconceptions persist to the present. The distinction between the sensationalised Western myth and the Chinese reality was noted by Westerners as early as 1895. That year, Australian traveller [[George Ernest Morrison]], who claimed to have witnessed an execution by slicing, wrote that "''lingchi'' [was] commonly, and quite wrongly, translated as 'death by slicing into 10,000 pieces' — a truly awful description of a punishment whose cruelty has been extraordinarily misrepresented... The mutilation is ghastly and excites our horror as an example of barbarian cruelty; but it is not cruel, and need not excite our horror, since the mutilation is done, not before death, but after."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor1-first=Jerome|editor1-last=Bourgon|editor2-first=Muriel|editor2-last=Detrie|editor3-first=Regis|editor3-last=Poulet|url=http://turandot.chineselegalculture.org/Textual.php?ID=167&amp;CF=2&amp;Fa=2|last=Morrison|first=George Ernest|publisher=CNRS|location=Lyon, FR|title=Turandot|accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to apocryphal lore, ''lingchi'' began when the torturer, wielding an extremely sharp knife, began by putting out the eyes, rendering the condemned incapable of seeing the remainder of the torture and, presumably, adding considerably to the psychological terror of the procedure. Successive rather minor cuts chopped off ears, nose, tongue, fingers, toes and genitals before proceeding to cuts that removed large portions of flesh from more sizable parts, e.g., thighs and shoulders.

The entire process was said to last three days, and to total 3,600 cuts. The heavily carved bodies of the deceased were then put on a parade for a show in the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|title=Death by a Thousand Cuts at Chinese Arts Centre 18th January to 23rd March|publisher=Manchester events guide|accessdate=2009-07-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418031632/http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|archive-date=18 April 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some victims were reportedly given doses of [[opium]] to alleviate suffering.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

[[John Roberts (historian)|John Morris Roberts]], in ''Twentieth Century: The History of the World, 1901 to 2000'' (2000), writes "the traditional punishment of death by slicing... became part of the western image of Chinese backwardness as the 'death of a thousand cuts.'" Roberts then notes that slicing "was ordered, in fact, for [[Kang Youwei|K'ang Yu-Wei]], a man termed the '[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] of China', and a major advocate of intellectual and government reform in the 1890s."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p.&amp;nbsp;60, footnote 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The abolition was immediately enforced, and definite: no official sentences of ''lingchi'' were performed in China after April 1905.

Regarding the use of opium, as related in the introduction to Morrison's book, [[Meyrick Hewlett]] insisted that "most Chinese people sentenced to death were given large quantities of opium before execution, and Morrison avers that a charitable person would be permitted to push opium into the mouth of someone dying in agony, thus hastening the moment of decease." At the very least, such tales were deemed credible to British officials in China and other Western observers.

==History==
[[File:Martyrdom of Joseph Marchand.jpg|thumb|upright=1|left|Execution of [[Joseph Marchand]] in Vietnam, 1835.]]

''Lingchi'' existed under the earliest emperors,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} although similar but less cruel tortures were often prescribed instead. Under the reign of [[Qin Er Shi]], the second emperor of the [[Qin dynasty]], multiple tortures were used to punish officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sima|first1=Qian|authorlink1=Sima Qian|title=Records of the Grand Historian|date=91 BCE|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=87|title-link=Records of the Grand Historian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ban|first1=Gu|authorlink1=Ban Gu|title=Book of Han|date=82 CE|language=Chinese|chapter=23|title-link=Book of Han}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2015|reason=can't determine if this amounted to lesser torture or worse}} The arbitrary, cruel, and short-lived [[Liu Ziye]] was apt to kill innocent officials by ''lingchi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shen|first1=Yue|authorlink1=Shen Yue|title=Book of Song|date=488 CE|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=9|title-link=Book of Song}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi|Gao Yang]] killed only six people by this method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=Baiyao|authorlink1=Li Baiyao|title=Book of Northern Qi|date=636 CE|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=3|title-link=Book of Northern Qi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[An Lushan]] killed only one man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ouyang|first1=Xiu|authorlink1=Ouyang Xiu|title=New Book of Tang|date=1060 CE|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=215|title-link=New Book of Tang}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=中國歷史上幾次最著名的凌遲之刑|trans-title=Several of the Most Famous Lingchi Cases in Chinese History|url=http://books.sina.com/artbook/exposure/2008-07-03/ba14878.shtml|date=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801021147/http://books.sina.com/artbook/exposure/2008-07-03/ba14878.shtml|archive-date=1 August 2009 |website=[[Sina Corp|Sina]]|language=Chinese|access-date=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lingchi'' was known in the [[Five Dynasties]] period (907–960 CE); but, in one of the earliest such acts, [[Shi Jingtang]] abolished it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Xue|first1=Juzheng|authorlink1=Xue Juzheng|title=Old History of the Five Dynasties|date=974 CE|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=147|title-link=Old History of the Five Dynasties}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other rulers continued to use it.

The method was prescribed in the [[Liao dynasty]] law codes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Toqto'a|authorlink1=Toqto'a (Yuan dynasty)|title=History of Liao|date=1344|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=61|title-link=History of Liao}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Toqto'a|authorlink1=Toqto'a (Yuan dynasty)|title=History of Liao|date=1344|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=112-114|title-link=History of Liao}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emperor Tianzuo of Liao|Emperor Tianzuo]] often executed people in this way during his rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Toqto'a|authorlink1=Toqto'a (Yuan dynasty)|title=History of Liao|date=1344|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=62|title-link=History of Liao}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became more widely used in the [[Song dynasty]] under [[Emperor Renzong of Song|Emperor Renzong]] and [[Emperor Shenzong of Song|Emperor Shenzong]].

Another early proposal for abolishing ''lingchi'' was submitted by [[Lu You]] (1125–1210) in a memorandum to the imperial court of the [[Song dynasty|Southern Song dynasty]]. Lu You's elaborate argument against ''lingchi'' was piously copied and transmitted by generations of scholars, among them influential jurists of all dynasties, until the late Qing dynasty reformist [[Shen Jiaben]] (1840–1913) included it in his 1905 memorandum that obtained the abolition. This anti-''lingchi'' trend coincided with a more general attitude opposed to "cruel and unusual" punishments (such as the exposure of the head) that the Tang dynasty had not included in the canonic table of the [[Five Punishments]], which defined the legal ways of punishing crime. Hence the abolitionist trend is deeply ingrained in the Chinese legal tradition, rather than being purely derived from Western influences.

Under later emperors, ''lingchi'' was reserved for only the most heinous acts, such as treason,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zhang, Tingyu|authorlink1=Zhang Tingyu|title=History of Ming|date=1739|location=China|language=Chinese|chapter=54|title-link=History of Ming}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacehall.com/cgi-bin/news/gb_display/print_version.cgi?art=/gb/pubvp/2006/03&amp;link=200603030452.shtml 清华大学教授刘书林——中国第一汉奸曾国藩]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813154736/http://www.peacehall.com/cgi-bin/news/gb_display/print_version.cgi?art=%2Fgb%2Fpubvp%2F2006%2F03&amp;link=200603030452.shtml |date=13 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a charge often dubious or false, as exemplified by the deaths of [[Liu Jin]], a [[Ming dynasty]] eunuch, and [[Yuan Chonghuan]], a Ming dynasty general. In 1542, ''lingchi'' was inflicted on a group of palace women who had [[Renyin palace rebellion|attempted to assassinate]] the [[Jiajing Emperor]], along with his favourite concubine, [[Consort Duan (Cao)|Consort Duan]]. The bodies of the women were then displayed in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor1=History Office | title=明實錄：明世宗實錄| language=Chinese | trans-title=Veritable Records of the Ming: Veritable Records of Shizong of Ming | url=http://ctext.org/wiki.pl?if=gb&amp;res=309093 | publisher=Ctext | date=1620s | volume=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports from Qing dynasty jurists such as Shen Jiaben show that executioners' customs varied, as the regular way to perform this penalty was not specified in detail in the penal code.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

''Lingchi'' was also known in Vietnam, notably being used as the method of execution of the French missionary [[Joseph Marchand]], in 1835, as part of the repression following the unsuccessful [[Lê Văn Khôi revolt]].

An 1858 account by ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' claimed the martyr [[Auguste Chapdelaine]] was killed by ''lingchi''; in reality he was beaten to death.

As Western countries moved to abolish similar punishments, some Westerners began to focus attention on the methods of execution used in China. As early as 1866, the time when Britain itself moved to abolish its own cruel method of [[hanging, drawing, and quartering]], [[Thomas Francis Wade]], then serving with the British diplomatic mission in China, unsuccessfully urged the abolition of ''lingchi''.

''Lingchi'' remained in the [[Qing dynasty]]'s code of laws for persons convicted of high treason and other serious crimes, but the punishment was abolished as a result of the 1905 revision of the Chinese penal code by Shen Jiaben.&lt;ref&gt;Shen, Jiaben.

==Published accounts==
* [[Sir Henry Norman, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Norman]], ''The People and Politics of the Far East'' (1895). Norman was a widely travelled writer and photographer whose collection is now owned by the [[University of Cambridge]]. Norman gives an eyewitness account of various physical punishments and tortures inflicted in a magistrate's court (''[[yamen]]'') and of the execution by beheading of 15 men. He gives the following graphic account of a ''lingchi'' execution but does not claim to have witnessed such an execution himself. "[The executioner] grasping handfuls from the fleshy parts of the body such as the thighs and breasts slices them away... the limbs are cut off piecemeal at the wrists and ankles, the elbows and knees, shoulders and hips. Finally the condemned is stabbed to the heart and the head is cut off."&lt;ref&gt;[http://turandot.chineselegalculture.org/Textual.php?ID=3&amp;CF=2&amp;Fa=5 Turandot: Chinese Torture/Supplice chinois]. CNRS. Retrieved 20 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George Ernest Morrison]], ''An Australian in China'' (1895) differs from some other reports in stating that most ''lingchi'' mutilations are in fact made [[post-mortem]]. Morrison wrote his description based on an account related by a claimed eyewitness: "The prisoner is tied to a rude cross: he is invariably deeply under the influence of [[opium]]. The executioner, standing before him, with a sharp sword makes two quick incisions above the eyebrows, and draws down the portion of skin over each eye, then he makes two more quick incisions across the breast, and in the next moment he pierces the heart, and death is instantaneous. Then he cuts the body in pieces; and the degradation consists in the fragmentary shape in which the prisoner has to appear in heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pratyeka.org/books/australian-in-china/|title=An Australian in China|publisher=Pratyeka|date=25 August 2002|accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tienstin ([[Tianjin]]), ''The China Year Book'' (1927), p.&amp;nbsp;1401, contains contemporary reports from fighting in [[Guangzhou]] (Canton) between the [[Nationalist government|Nanjing government]] and [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] forces. Stories of various atrocities are related, including accounts of ''lingchi''. There is no mention of opium, and these cases appear to be government propaganda.
* ''[[The Times]]'', (9 December 1927), a journalist reported from the city of Guangzhou (Canton) that the Communists were targeting Christian priests and that "It was announced that Father Wong was to be publicly executed by the slicing process."
* [[George Roerich]], "Trails to Inmost Asia" (1931), p . 119, relates the story of the assassination of Yang Tseng-hsin, Governor of [[Xinjiang|Sinkiang]] in July 1928, by the bodyguard of his foreign minister Fan Yao-han. Fan was seized, and he and his daughter were both executed by ''lingchi'', the minister made to watch his daughter's execution first. Roerich was not an eyewitness to this event, having already returned to India by the date of the execution.
* [[George Ryley Scott]], ''History of Torture'' (1940) claims that many were executed this way by the Chinese Communist insurgents; he cites claims made by the Nanking government in 1927. It is perhaps uncertain whether these claims were anti-communist propaganda. Scott also uses the term "the slicing process" and differentiates between the different types of execution in different parts of the country. There is no mention of opium. Riley's book contains a picture of a sliced corpse (with no mark to the heart) that was killed in Guangzhou (Canton) in 1927. It gives no indication of whether the slicing was done post-mortem. Scott claims it was common for the relatives of the condemned to bribe the executioner to kill the condemned before the slicing procedure began.

===Photographs===
The first Western photographs of ''lingchi'' were taken in 1890 by William Arthur Curtis of Kentucky in [[Guangzhou]] (Canton).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Jerome|last1=Bourgon|first2=Muriel|last2=Detrie|first3=Regis|last3=Poulet|url=http://turandot.chineselegalculture.org/Essay.php?ID=3|title=Turandot: Chinese Torture/Supplice chinois|publisher=CNRS|accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French soldiers stationed in [[Beijing]] had the opportunity to photograph three different ''lingchi'' executions in 1905:

Even related to the correct set of photos, Carpeaux's narrative is highly dubious; for instance, an examination of the Chinese judicial archives show that Carpeaux bluntly invented the execution decree. The proclamation is reported to state: "The Mongolian princes demand that the aforesaid Fou-Tchou-Le, guilty of the murder of Prince Ao-Han-Ouan, be burned alive, but the Emperor finds this torture too cruel and condemns Fou-Tchou-Li to slow death by ''leng-tch-e'' (different spelling of ''lingchi'', cutting into pieces)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.va.com.au/parallel/x1/journal/lmw/coup.html|title=Journal: coup de grâce (#1)|first=Linda Marie|last=Walker|publisher=VA|accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{In popular culture|date=August 2017}}
Accounts of ''lingchi'' or the extant photographs have inspired or referenced in numerous artistic, literary, and cinematic media. Some works have attempted to put the process in a historical context; others, possibly due to the scarcity of detailed historical information, have attempted to extrapolate the details or present innovations of method that may be products of an author's creative license. Some of these descriptions may have influenced modern public perceptions of the historic practice.

===Non-fiction===
[[Susan Sontag]] mentions the 1905 case in ''Regarding the Pain of Others'' (2003). One reviewer wrote that though Sontag includes no photographs in her book – a volume about photography – "she does tantalisingly describe a photograph that obsessed the philosopher [[Georges Bataille]], in which a Chinese criminal, while being chopped up and slowly [[flaying|flayed]] by executioners, rolls his eyes heavenwards in [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] bliss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/politicsphilosophyandsociety/0%2C6121%2C1011239%2C00.html|title=Observer review: Regarding the Pain of Others by Susan Sontag|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 August 2003|accessdate=30 July 2009|location=London|first=Peter|last=Conrad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Georges Bataille]] wrote about ''lingchi'' in ''L'expérience intérieure'' (1943) and in ''Le coupable'' (1944). He included five pictures in his ''The Tears of Eros'' (1961; translated into English and published by [[City Lights Bookstore|City Lights]] in 1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.jcrt.org/archives/04.3/york.pdf|first=David|last=York|title=Flesh And Consciousness: George Bataille and the Dionysian|journal=JCRT|date=August 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians [[Timothy Brook (historian)|Timothy Brook]], Jérome Bourgon and Gregory Blue, criticised Bataille for his language, mistakes and dubious content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Jerome|last1=Bourgon|first2=Muriel|last2=Detrie|first3=Regis|last3=Poulet|url=http://turandot.chineselegalculture.org/Essay.php?ID=27|title=Turandot: Chinese Torture/Supplice chinois|publisher=CNRS|accessdate=30 July 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|chapter=6.

===Literature===
The "death by a thousand cuts" with reference to China is also mentioned in [[Malcolm Bosse]]'s novel ''The Examination'', [[Amy Tan]]'s novel ''[[The Joy Luck Club (novel)|The Joy Luck Club]]'', and [[Robert van Gulik]]'s ''[[Judge Dee]]'' novels. The 1905 photos are mentioned in [[Thomas Harris]]' novel ''[[Hannibal (Harris novel)|Hannibal]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://hannibal.hannotations.com/hannibal1.html|title=Hannibal|chapter=Section I|publisher=Hannotations|accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Julio Cortázar]]'s novel ''[[Hopscotch (Cortázar novel)|Hopscotch]]''.

===Film===
Inspired by the 1905 photos, Chinese artist Chen Chien-jen created a 25-minute film called ''Lingchi'', which has generated some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icwirral.icnetwork.co.uk/entertainment/newsandreviews/tm_objectid=15700731&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50061&amp;headline=could-you-look-away-from-the-death-of-a-thousand-cuts--name_page.html |title=WirralNews |publisher=IC network |accessdate=30 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317122730/http://icwirral.icnetwork.co.uk/entertainment/newsandreviews/tm_objectid%3D15700731%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D50061%26headline%3Dcould-you-look-away-from-the-death-of-a-thousand-cuts--name_page.html |archive-date=17 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A scene of Lingchi also appeared on the film [[The Sand Pebbles (film)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8962">'''Mesures usuelles''' ({{IPA-fr|məzyʁ yzɥɛl}}, ''customary measurements'') were a system of [[measurement]] introduced by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] in 1812 to act as compromise between the [[SI|metric system]] and traditional measurements. The system was restricted to use in the retail industry and continued in use until 1839.

==Rationale behind the new system==
[[File:Napoleon Groot.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The ''ordinary measures'' were introduced by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] in 1812]]
In the five years immediately before the [[French First Republic]] introduced the [[metric system]], every effort was made to make the citizens aware of the upcoming changes and to prepare them for it.&lt;ref name="Alder"/&gt; The administration distributed tens of thousands of educational pamphlets, private enterprise produced educational games, guides, almanacs and conversion aids, and metre standards were built into the walls of prominent buildings around Paris.&lt;ref name="Alder"/&gt; The introduction was phased by district over the next few years, with Paris being the first district to change. The government also realised that the people would need metre rulers, but they had only provided 25,000 of the 500,000 rulers needed in Paris as late as one month after the metre became the sole legal unit of measure.&lt;ref name="Alder"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Measure of all Things - The Seven-Year-Odyssey that Transformed the World |last= Alder |first= Ken |year= 2002 |publisher= Abacus |location= London |isbn=0-349-11507-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; To compensate, the government introduced incentives for the mass-production of rulers. Paris police reported widespread flouting of the requirement for merchants to use only the metric system.&lt;ref name="Alder"/&gt; Where the new system was in use, it was abused, with shopkeepers taking the opportunity to round prices up and to give smaller measures.&lt;ref name="Alder"/&gt;

[[image:Louis-Philippe-France.png|150px|thumb|right|The ''Mesures usuelles'' were abolished by Louis-Philippe in 1839]]
[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]], the French Emperor, disliked the inconvenience of surrendering the high [[factorization|factorability]] of traditional measures in the name of [[decimal]]isation, and recognized the difficulty of getting it accepted by the populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the ''décret impérial du 12 février 1812'' (imperial decree of 12 February 1812), he introduced a new system of measurement, the ''mesures usuelles'' or "customary measures", for use in small retail businesses. However, all government, legal and similar works still had to use the metric system and the metric system continued to be taught at all levels of education.&lt;ref name=historique&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example the engineering textbook, {{cite book
|title = Traité élémentaire de méchanique industrielle

The [[prototype]]s of the metric unit, the [[kilogram]] and the [[metre]], enabled an immediate standardization of measurement over the whole country,  replacing the varying legal measures in different parts of the country, and even more across the whole of Europe. The new ''livre'' (known as the ''livre métrique'') was defined as five hundred  [[gram]]s, and the new ''toise'' (''toise métrique'') was defined as two [[metre]]s. Products could be sold in shops under the old names and with the old relationships to one another, but with slightly different absolute sizes. This series of measurements was called ''mesures usuelles''.

Napoleon's decree was revoked during the reign of [[Louis Philippe]] by the ''loi du 4 juillet 1837'' (law of 4 July 1837). This took effect on 1 January 1840, and reinstated the original metric system, thus bringing the system of ''mesures usuelles'' to an end.&lt;ref name=historique/&gt;

==Permitted units==
The law authorised the following units of measure:&lt;ref name=H&amp;H&gt;{{cite web

* {{anchor|pied}} The ''[[toise]]'' (fathom) was defined as two metres and was divided into 6 ''pieds'', or "feet" and 72 ''pouces'' (inches). The ''pouce'' was divided into 12 ''lignes'', or (lines). The ''pied'' and ''pouce'', at approximately 333.3&amp;nbsp;mm  and 27.78&amp;nbsp;mm, were about 2.6% larger than the previous Parisian measures and 9% larger than their British counterparts.
*The ''aune'' ([[ell]]), used to measure cloth, was defined as 120 centimetres, and divided into the ''demi aune'' (half an ell) and the ''tiers aune'' (third of an ell). It was 1.3% larger than ''l’aune de Paris'' (118.48&amp;nbsp;cm) and 5.0% larger than its English counterpart (45&amp;nbsp;inches; 114.3&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher = histoire-genealogie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*The [[litre]] was subdivided like an English [[quart]], into ''demis'' (literally, "halves", being the equivalent of a [[pint]] of about sixteen [[fluid ounce]]s), ''quarts'' (literally, "fourths", being the equivalent of a cup of about eight fluid ounces), ''huitièmes'' (literally, "eighths") and ''seizièmes'' (literally, "sixteenths", of about two fluid ounces).
*The ''boisseau'', ([[bushel]]), was redefined as being an eighth of a hectolitre and with associated measures ''double-boisseau'', ''demi-boisseau'' and ''quart-boisseau'' (double, half and quarter bushels respectively). The original ''boisseau'', like the English bushel, varied depending on the ''commodity for which'' it was used, as well as the ''region where'' it was used.
*The ''livre'', ([[Pound (mass)|pound]]), was defined as 500&amp;nbsp;grams, divided into 16 ''onces'', (ounces), each ''once'' being divided into 8 ''gros''. Each gros being thought of as being composed of 72 ''grains'', whose name is the same as in English. Hence, the livre was 9216 ''grains''.&lt;ref name=Europa1842/&gt;  The ''livre'' and ''once'' were about 10% larger than their English counterparts, while the ''grain'' was 17% less than its English counterpart. It can be noted that the metric livre, although not legal, is still commonly used in daily life in France in the 21st century.

The ''mesures usuelles'' did not include any units of length greater than the ''toise'' - the ''[[myriamètre]]'' (10&amp;nbsp;km) remaining in use throughout this period.&lt;ref name="Europa1842"&gt;{{cite web

'''''Mouchette.org''''' is an interactive website created in 1996 by a [[pseudonym]]ous character, an Amsterdam-based artist who calls herself "Mouchette". With her innocent salutation and claims to be "nearly thirteen"&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_/ai_75914220 |title=Immaterial Girl – website based on Mouchette film character – Brief Article |accessdate=2008-05-01 |author=Jane Harris |date=May 2001 |work= |publisher=ArtForum}}{{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; greeting the visitor from the introduction page, what initially appears as a personal website of a pre-pubescent female artist evolves into darker themes in the subsequent pages.

Mouchette is loosely based on a 1937 book by [[Georges Bernanos]] and the 1967 [[Robert Bresson]] movie, ''[[Mouchette]]''. The storyline is about a French teenager who commits suicide after she is raped. An online quiz comparing the  "Neo-Mouchette"&lt;ref name=IA&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Rachel |title=Internet Art |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |series= |year=2004 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd. |location= London |isbn=0-500-20376-8 |pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the movie angered Bresson's widow, so she threatened a lawsuit against the artist behind the project. The quiz was taken down after that incident.&lt;ref name=NMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=SACD&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mouchette.org/film/quiz.html |title=SACD letter |accessdate=2008-04-29 |website=Mouchette.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leo&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sant |first=Toni |authorlink=Toni Sant |author2=Santorineos, Manthos |year=2005 |title=Rape, Murder and Suicide Are Easier When You Use a Keyboard Shortcut: Mouchette, an On-Line Virtual Character |journal=Leonardo |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=203–207 |url=http://leonardo.info/ |accessdate=2008-04-25 |quote= |doi=10.1162/0024094054028921 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509070115/http://www.leonardo.info/ |archivedate=2008-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creator of the website has been a closely guarded secret,&lt;ref name=NMA/&gt; though the piece has somewhat recently been claimed by artist [[Martine Neddam]].  While the use of taboo subject matters are what initially "provokes heated reactions",&lt;ref name=NMA/&gt; the manipulation of cyber identity&lt;ref name=NMA/&gt; and the ability of the creator to maintain anonymity for so long are the significant reasons this website has garnered its "international reputation"&lt;ref name=Leo/&gt;  in the [[Internet art]] community.

==Summary and themes==
{{cquote|My name is Mouchette&lt;br&gt;I live in Amsterdam&lt;br&gt;I am nearly 13 years old&lt;br&gt;I am an artist...}}

This simple and "deceptively innocent"&lt;ref name=NMA&gt;{{cite book |title=New Media Art |last=Tribe |first=Mark |author2=Jana, Reena |year=2007 |url= https://wiki.brown.edu/confluence/display/MarkTribe/New+Media+Art |chapter=Mouchette |chapterurl=https://wiki.brown.edu/confluence/display/MarkTribe/Mouchette |publisher=Taschen |location=Germany |isbn=978-3-8228-3041-3 |pages=66–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; introduction, which appears next to a portrait of a "sad eyed"&lt;ref name=IA/&gt; adolescent girl on the main page with a floral background, is in stark contrast to the complexity of the rest of the site. Consisting "of various secret links, electronic interactive texts, and poems that reveal the multiple faces of the artist, along with her fears and obsessions",&lt;ref name=Dart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~arthist/content/websites/website4/website4.html|title=Mouchette: "Interactivity and Accountability" |accessdate=2008-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; participants of the website are often left wondering whether "a website this sophisticated [could] really be the work of a 13 year old girl".&lt;ref name=NMA/&gt;

===Suicide, death, and violence===
Just like the film ''[[Mouchette]]'', one of the many themes running throughout Mouchette.org is the idea of death. The recurring image of a fly is present on many of the pages. The word "mouchette" translates into English as "little fly". The comparable lives between the Mouchettes – the fly and the girl – are intersected when it revolves around the death of the fly. On one page, Mouchette refers to herself as the fly and blames the web visitor for killing her when he/she pressed a button on the previous webpage.&lt;ref name=fly&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mouchette.org/fly/dead.html |title=Mouchette.org: "dead fly" |accessdate=2008-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On another page, somber music plays as the phrase "Lullaby for a dead fly" is shown on the screen.&lt;ref name=lullaby&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mouchette.org/fly/flies.html |title=Mouchette.org: "Lullaby for a dead fly" |accessdate=2008-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As stated in ''Internet Art'', "in early iterations of the site, the virtual persona Mouchette was obsessed with suicide".&lt;ref name=IA/&gt; One page asks the viewer on what they think the best way to kill yourself when you’re under 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mouchette.org/suicide/suikit.html |title=Mouchette.org: "Suicide Kit" |accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a page entitled m.org.ue, an image of feet is shown, with one foot wearing a toe tag, while ghostly music plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://mouchette.org/m.org.ue/index.html |title=Mouchette.org: "m.org.ue" |accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a link called "meet my parent" is clicked, it directs to a page that has scanned images of meat, with the words "Papa" and "Maman" carved in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mouchette.org/flesh/pere.html |title=Mouchette.org: "my father" |accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On another page, an image of a cat violently shakes on the screen while sounds of screaming are playing; the viewer is asked to kill this cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mouchette.org/cat/index.html |title=Mouchette.org: "Kll that cat" |accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex===
"Sexually suggestive"&lt;ref name=NMA/&gt; themes are present throughout the site. One the opening page of the section named "***digital flesh&amp;blood***" the background image is of a close up of a young girl’s face, sticking out her tongue. The text accompanying this image reads: "Want to know what my tongue tastes like? Try it on your screen and tell me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mouchette.org/flesh/tong.html |title=Mouchette.org:"***digital flesh&amp;blood***" |accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another page, titled "touché", has a completely black background, with tiny white words scattered in different sections of the page.  As the pointer scrolls over specific points on the page, sounds of a woman gasping are activated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mouchette.org/secret/secret.html |title=Mouchette.org: "touché" |accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many pages of this website have interactive web forms that include multiple-choice questions asking your email address. Days or weeks later the viewer might get unexpected flirtatious email messages from Mouchette.&lt;ref name=NMA/&gt;

===Manipulating identity===
Participants are given the opportunity to "become Mouchette", when they become a member of the "Mouchette Network". Members can "create true Mouchette webpages" and are given "a unique opportunity to become a great artist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edit.mouchette.org/ |title=Mouchette.org: Become Mouchette |accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interactive questionnaires often will ask you to post your name and email address if you answer one of the questions. But the anonymity of the creator and the unsettling topics makes a participant wonder how seriously he/she should answer the questions, including question about  their name and identity.&lt;ref name=Dart/&gt;

Days/weeks later, participants will get a random email from Mouchette. This will often be unsettling because it's random and unexpected, leaving the participant to question their identity/decision to input personal information of the website.

The website's exploration of manipulating identity has been compared to conceptual photographer, [[Cindy Sherman]].&lt;ref name=NMA/&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==
{{Criticism section|date=November 2010}}
With its taboo subject matter, Mouchette.org has "provoked heated reaction"&lt;ref name=NMA/&gt; in the art community. An interactive forum allows participants to  state why they hate Mouchette.

In an early version of Mouchette.org, there was a quiz comparing web persona Mouchette and the  lead character in the [[Robert Bresson|Bresson]] film ''[[Mouchette]]''. Images taken from the film were used in this quiz. In 2002, the Robert Bresson estate "threatened legal action against the artist"&lt;ref name=NMA/&gt; responsible for Mouchette.org. According to [[Toni Sant]], "This case brought the online piece to the attention of many who might have overlooked it in the plethora of Net Art that has emerged over the past few years".&lt;ref name=Leo/&gt; In a letter from the [[SACD (Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques)]] (the French Society of Dramatic Authors and Composers) addressed to the creator of Mouchette.org, it states that Bresson's widow "demands that all reference to the film ''Mouchette''...be eliminated from your website."&lt;ref name=SACD/&gt; According to Sant, "this copyright issue raises the question of ownership over fictional identities...and raises issues of originality and ownership."&lt;ref name=Leo/&gt;

After the forced removal of the quiz from Mouchette.org, "as a protest, a growing network of websites are hosting copies of this work which is no longer allowed to be shown on &lt;nowiki&gt;http://mouchette.org&lt;/nowiki&gt;" The distributor of the quiz blames the "narrow-mindedness of the heir of the copyright" for censoring "a work which is an homage celebrating the source of its inspiration."&lt;ref name=censor&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drivedrive.com/mouchette/censored.html |title=Mouchette.org: "Censored" |accessdate=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OneLogin was founded in 2009 in San Francisco by Thomas and Christian Pedersen. The brothers were involved with the on-demand help desk application, [[Zendesk]], before launching OneLogin.

This is where the idea came to build an identity and access management solution that was secure and easy to use. OneLogin officially launched in 2010.&lt;ref name="FCV"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kepes|first1=Ben|title=From Copenhagen To The Valley - OneLogin's Journey|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2013/10/30/from-copenhagen-to-the-valley-onelogins-journey/#486955b744b8|website=Forbes|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, OneLogin appointed Brad Brooks as chief executive officer.&lt;ref name="GNW"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/08/08/1081741/0/en/OneLogin-Appoints-Brad-Brooks-as-Chief-Executive-Officer.html|title=(Press Release) OneLogin Appoints Brad Brooks as Chief Executive Officer|last=|first=|date=|website=GlobeNewsWire|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''OneLogin Security Breach, August 2016''

In August 2016, OneLogin reported that "an unauthorised user gained access to one of our standalone systems, which we use for log storage and analytics.". The single user accessed the service for a month or more, and may have been able to see Secure Notes unencrypted. To remediate, OneLogin fixed the cleartext logging bug, locked down access to the log management system, and reset passwords.&lt;ref name="OLBreach1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.onelogin.com/blog/august-2016-incident|title=(Press Release) August 2016 Incident|last=|first=|date=|website=OneLogin|publisher=OneLogin|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''OneLogin Security Breach, May 2017''

On May 31, 2017, OneLogin detected and stopped unauthorized access in their US data region. According to a OneLogin blog post on the breach, "a threat actor used one of our AWS keys to gain access to our AWS platform via an API from an intermediate host with another, smaller service provider in the US."&lt;ref name="Breach2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.onelogin.com/blog/may-31-2017-security-incident|title=(Press Release) May 31, 2017 Security Incident|last=|first=|date=|website=OneLogin|publisher=OneLogin|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OneLogin staff detected the intrusion in seven hours. This seven hour Time to Detection (TTD) was faster than Cisco's estimated industry average of 100–200 days to detect a breach and FireEye's 146 days to detect a breach, and slightly faster than Cisco's best median TTD of nine hours to discover security issues.&lt;ref name="Kenna17"&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Rise in Non-Targeted Attacks Has Widened the Remediation Gap|url=https://www.kennasecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/Kenna-NonTargetedAttacksReport.pdf|website=Kenna|publisher=Kenna Security|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InfocyteFireEye"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerritz|first1=Chris|title=Breach Detection by the Numbers: Days, Weeks or Years?|url=https://www.infocyte.com/blog/2016/7/26/how-many-days-does-it-take-to-discover-a-breach-the-answer-may-shock-you|website=Infocyte|publisher=Infocyte|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OneLogin staff shut down the affected instances as well as the compromised AWS keys within several minutes to stop the intrusion and confirmed there were no other active threats. This was significantly faster than the industry average of 100–120 days to remediate existing vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name="Kenna17" /&gt;

The company has since improved its monitoring of AWS API endpoint signals, strengthened AWS key management, enhanced infrastructure and application encryption, expanded threat hunting activities and created additional in-app risk mitigation tools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4056">'''Pepero Day''' is held annually on [[November 11]], and is an observance in [[South Korea]] similar to [[Valentine's Day]]. It involves the gifting or exchange of [[Pepero]] snacks, a line of [[chocolate]]-dipped [[cookie]] sticks, with the intention of displaying affection for friends and loved ones. It is held on this day due to the resemblance of Pepero sticks, which are vertical that mirror the shortened date of 11/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2014/11/511_167943.html|title=Pepero Day: Eight things you should know|date=2014-11-11|work=koreatimes|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The exact origins of this day are unknown.&lt;ref name="About Day"&gt;{{cite web |last=Imatome-Yun |first=Naomi |title=November 11th is Pepero Day |url=http://koreanfood.about.com/od/holidaysandoccasions/a/November-11th-Is-Pepero-Day.htm |publisher=About.com |accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins are usually traced to a news story set in 1983. In the story, two female [[middle school]] students in the [[Yeongnam]] region exchanged Pepero wishing that they would both become tall and thin.&lt;ref name="Dict Day"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=68928&amp;cid=386&amp;categoryId=386 |script-title=ko:빼빼로데이 |publisher=Parkmungak |accessdate=November 11, 2013 |language=Korean |trans-title=Pepero Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is some doubt about this story.&lt;ref name="DJC Day"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gale |first=Alastair |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/11/11/on-pepero-day-a-japanese-rival-lurks/ |title=On Pepero Day, a Japanese Rival Lurks |work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company |subscription=yes |date=November 11, 2013 |accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the origin was due to the shape of 1’s in the date (November 11 – 11/11) resembling Pepero sticks,&lt;ref name="About Day" /&gt; while some others attribute the similarity of shapes as factors that attributed to the popularity but not its origin.&lt;ref name="Dict Day" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DJC Day" /&gt;

The fad spread with the idea that, for maximum effectiveness for height and thinness, one must eat 11 packets of Pepero on November 11, 11:11am and 11:11pm  at 11 seconds exactly. From 1997, [[Lotte (conglomerate)|Lotte]] started to use the aforementioned school story to successfully promote Pepero Day. The trend led to other companies creating similarly shaped snacks to participate on Pepero Day.&lt;ref name="Dict Day" /&gt; {{As of|2012}}, [[Lotte (conglomerate)|Lotte]] was making 50% of its annual sales on Pepero Day.&lt;ref name="DJC Day" /&gt; {{As of|2013}}, several [[department store]]s including [[Hyundai Department Store]], [[Shinsegae]], and [[Lotte Department Store]] were benefiting for people celebrating the day while stores such as [[E-mart]] and [[Homeplus]] were specially displaying and selling peperos on the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.sportsseoul.com/read/economy/1268607.htm |title= [SS현장] '빼빼로 데이' 일부 소비자 "과소비 조장"…롯데마트 "안 사면 그만" |publisher=Sportsseoul.com |date=November 11, 2013 |language=Korean |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111232204/http://news.sportsseoul.com/read/economy/1268607.htm |archivedate=2013-11-11 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Pepero Day has been criticized for being a business tool of certain [[company|companies]] and for having high [[calorie]]s which is contradictory to its original meaning. Alternatives include "Garaetteok Day", which promotes Farmer’s Day through exchanges of [[garaetteok]] (sticks of white [[tteok]]).&lt;ref name="Dict Day" /&gt;

{{refimprove|date=March 2016}}
A '''pulse per second''' ('''PPS''' or '''1PPS''') is an [[electrical signal]] that has a width of less than one second and a sharply rising or abruptly falling edge that [[Accuracy and precision|accurately]] repeats once per [[second]]. PPS signals are output by radio beacons, [[frequency standard]]s, other types of precision [[oscillator]]s and some [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eftf.org/proceedings/proceedingsEFTF2012.pdf] M. Siccardi, ''About time measurements'', EFTF 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Precision clocks are sometimes manufactured by interfacing a PPS signal generator to processing equipment that aligns the PPS signal to the [[UTC]] second and converts it to a useful display. [[Atomic clock]]s usually have an external PPS output, although internally they may operate at 9,192,631,770&amp;nbsp;Hz. PPS signals have an accuracy ranging from a 12 picoseconds to a few microseconds per second, or 2.0 nanoseconds to a few milliseconds per day based on the resolution and accuracy of the device generating the signal.

== Physical representation ==
PPS signals are usually generated as a TTL signal capable of driving a 1 kilohm load. Some sources use line drivers in order to be capable of driving 50 ohm transmission lines. Because of the broad frequency contents, a long transmission line can have significant impact on the shape of the PPS signal due to dispersion and after delivery effects of the dielectric of the transmission line. It is common to set t0 at the voltage level of the steepest slope of a PPS signal. PPS signals are therefore notoriously unreliable when time transfer accuracies better than a ns are needed, although the stability of a PPS signal can reach into the ps regime depending on the generating device.

== Uses ==
PPS signals are used for precise timekeeping and time measurement.  One increasingly common use is in computer timekeeping, including the [[Network Time Protocol|NTP]] protocol.  Because GPS is considered a [[Network_Time_Protocol#Clock_strata|stratum]]-0 source, a common use for the PPS signal is to connect it to a PC using a low-latency, low-[[jitter]] wire [[Electrical connection|connection]] and allow a program to synchronize to it. This makes the PC a stratum-1 time source.  Note that because the PPS signal does not specify the time, but merely the start of a second, one must combine the PPS functionality with another time source that provides the full date and time in order to ascertain the time both accurately and precisely.

'''Petri net (PN) slicing''' is a [[syntactic]] technique used to reduce a PN model based on a given criterion.&lt;ref name=Ykhan13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ykhan14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rakow12 /&gt; Informally, a slicing criterion could be a property for which a PN model is analyzed or is a set of places, transitions, or both. A sliced part constitutes only that part of a PN model that may affect the criteria.

==Background==
The term slicing was coined by M. Weiser in the context of program [[debugging]].&lt;ref name=Mark81 /&gt; According to Wieser, a program slice is a reduced, [[executable program]] that can be obtained from a program P based on the variables of interest and [[line number]] by removing statements such that program slicing replicates part of the behavior of the program. The term was later adapted to the context of Petri nets and for other classes of Petri nets such as [[Algebraic Petri net]]s.&lt;ref name=Ykhan13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ykhan14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rakow12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ykhantool14 /&gt;

'''Social facilitation''', or the '''audience effect''', is the tendency for people to perform differently when in the presence of others than when alone. Compared to their performance when alone, when in the presence of others, they tend to perform better on simple or well-rehearsed tasks and worse on complex or new ones.&lt;ref name="Strauss"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Strauss|first= Bernd|date= July 2002|title= Social facilitation in motor tasks: a review of research and theory|url= |journal= Psychology of Sport and Exercise|publisher= |volume= 3|issue= 3|pages= 237–256|doi= 10.1016/S1469-0292(01)00019-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yerkes-Dodson law, when applied to social facilitation, states that "the mere presence of other people will enhance the performance in speed and accuracy of well-practiced tasks, but will degrade in the performance of less familiar tasks."&lt;ref name="Kirby"&gt;Kirby, L. (2011, March 17). Group Processes. Lecture presented to Social Psychology Course at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social facilitation has occasionally been attributed to the fact that certain people are more susceptible to [[social influence]], with the argument that personality factors can make these people more aware of evaluation.

The audience effect is an attempt at psychologically explaining why the presence of an audience leads to people's performing tasks better in some cases and worse in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Aiello|first= John R.|last2= Douthitt|first2= Elizabeth A.|date= 2001|title= Social Facilitation From Triplett to Economic Performance Monitoring|url= http://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/_private/gradsoc_articles/social%20loafing/Soc%20Facilitation-Triplett2.pdf|journal= [[Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice]]|publisher= |volume= 5|issue= 3|pages= 163–180|doi= 10.1037/1089-2699.5.3.163|accessdate= 13 November 2014|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140513142123/http://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/_private/gradsoc_articles/social%20loafing/Soc%20Facilitation-Triplett2.pdf|archivedate= 13 May 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was further explored when some studies showed that the presence of a passive audience facilitated the better performance of a simple task, while other studies showed that the presence of a passive audience inhibited the performance of a more difficult task or one that was not well practiced, possibly due to psychological pressure or [[Stress (psychological)|stress]]. (See [[Yerkes–Dodson law]].)

== History ==
Social facilitation can be defined as a tendency for individuals to perform differently when in the mere presence of others. Specifically, individuals perform better on simpler or well-rehearsed tasks and perform worse on complex or new ones. In relation to this, there are three main empirical relationships which are the activation, evaluation, and attention theories. The activation theory describes how we are physiologically aroused and how that affects our functioning. The evaluation theory relates to the systematic assessment of the worth or merit of some object. The attention theory takes into account possession in the mind including focalization and concentration of consciousness.

In 1897, Triplett&lt;ref name=smith&gt;[https://www.science.smith.edu/departments/EXER_SCI/ESS570/Soc.%20Fac/SocFacil.html]&lt;/ref&gt; studied the effect on performance of having an audience. Triplett's experiment had a simple design; a cyclist's performance when alone was compared with a cyclist's performance when racing against another cyclist. He found that the cyclist was slowest when he was only racing the clock and not another cyclist. He attributed these results to a competitive instinct which releases energy that was not available when pedaling alone. Triplett's study started off a revolution of studies attempting to examine the theory that people's performance is influenced by the presence of others. In 1898, while studying the competitive nature of children,&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt; he found that children were much faster at completing their given activity (winding string) while they were competing, which caused him to wonder whether or not simply having another individual there would have the same effect. To determine this, Triplett studied the race time of cyclists and found that cyclists had faster race times when in the presence of other cyclists. He theorized that the faster times were because the presence of others made individuals more competitive, and further research led Triplett to theorize that the presence of others increases individuals' performances in other noncompetitive situations as well.

In 1924, Floyd Allport, coined the term social facilitation.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt; Allport conducted studies in which participants sat either alone or with other participants and did a variety of tasks such as word association tasks and multiplication assessments. He found that people performed better when in a group setting than when alone for the majority of tasks.&lt;ref name="Zajonc1965"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zajonc|first= Robert B.|date= July 16, 1965|title= Social Facilitation|journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]]|publisher= [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]|volume= 149|issue= 3681|pages= 269–274|doi= 10.1126/science.149.3681.269|jstor=1715944}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at this time, social facilitation simply meant an "increase in response merely from the sight or sound of others making the same movement."&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

Hazel Markus of the [[University of Michigan]] conducted an experiment to test the hypothesis that the mere presence of others can influence an individual's performance.&lt;ref name="Markus1978"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Markus|first= Hazel|date= 1978|title=  The Effect of Mere Presence on Social Facilitation: An Unobtrusive Test|url= http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/22584/0000132.pdf|journal= [[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]]|publisher= |volume= 14|issue= 4|pages= 389–397|doi= 10.1016/0022-1031(78)90034-3|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A task that lacked a rubric structure and was likely to cause the subject to be apprehensive of how they would be evaluated was used. Performance times on the task of dressing and undressing in familiar and unfamiliar clothing were compared with subjects working alone, working in the presence of a passive inattentive person, and working in the presence of an attentive spectator. Compared to the alone condition, both social conditions (audience and incidental audience) enhanced performance on the well-learned aspects of the task of dressing and undressing with the subject's own familiar clothing and hindered the subject's performance on the more complex aspects of the task of dressing and undressing using unfamiliar clothing. It was concluded that the presence of others is a sufficient condition for social facilitation and social interference effects. Therefore, the presence of an audience causes an individual to do better on a simple task or worse on a more complicated task.

In a 2010 study, [[donation]] rates increased with the presence of observers, and [[neuroimaging]] revealed that the presence of observers significantly affected activation in the [[ventral striatum]] before the choice of whether or not to donate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Izuma|first= Keise|last2= Saito|first2= Daisuke N.|last3= Sadato|first3= Norihiro|date= April 2010|title= Processing of the Incentive for Social Approval in the Ventral Striatum during Charitable Donation|url= |journal= [[Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience]]|publisher= [[MIT Press]]|volume= 22|issue= 4|pages= 621–631|doi= 10.1162/jocn.2009.21228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Raefeli's meta-analysis of the social facilitation phenomenon in 2002, three conclusions are made. Firstly, the presence of others heightens an individual's physiological arousal only if the individual is performing a complex task. Moreover, the mere presence of others increases the speed of simple task performance and decrease the speed of complex task performance. Lastly, social facilitation effects are surprisingly unrelated to the performer's evaluation apprehension.&lt;ref name="Rafaeli, S 2002"&gt;Rafaeli, S; Rafaeli, S.; Noy, A.; Correspondence (September 2002).

A study was done in 2014 that compared the performance of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to typically developing (TD) individuals on a task with the presence of another. The experiment conducted tested the hypothesis that an individual with ASD, will respond to the presence of experimenters, thus altering the results of the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=7524ca24-1834-4ab5-99a2-13a16870db45%40sessionmgr4001&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=4201|title = Susceptibility to the audience effect explains performance gap between children with and without autism in a theory of mind task|last = Chevallier|first = C|date = 2014|journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology|doi = 10.1037/a0035483|pmid = |access-date = September 28, 2015|last2 = Parish-Morris|first2 = J|last3 = Tonge|first3 = N|last4 = Le|first4 = L|last5 = Miller|first5 = J|last6 = Schultz|first6 = R.T.|volume=143|pages=972–979|pmc = 4038654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major theoretical approaches ==
The major three approaches to social facilitation are the activation, evaluation, and attention theories. The activation theory describes how our arousal relates to social facilitation. The evaluation theory discusses how being assessed by an audience affects to social facilitation. The attention theory takes into account the effect of distractions in the environment on social facilitation.

=== Activation theory ===

In 1956, [[Robert Zajonc]]&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; was trying to figure out why some studies showed people's performance being hindered by the  presence of others rather than being made more accurate. He designed an experiment that would examine the performance of someone doing a simple vs. complex task in front of others. He found that, when people were performing a simple task in the presence of others, they could complete it with greater accuracy than when they were alone. This was something most psychologist were aware of at this time. However, what Zajonc found that was revolutionary in this time period was that, when people attempt to perform tasks which are more complex or with which they are not familiar, they complete it with less accuracy when in the presence of others than when they alone. Thus, [[social inhibition]] was born.

In 1965, Robert Zajonc developed the stern activation theory, by proposing his generalized drive hypothesis for social facilitation. Zajonc's generalized drive hypothesis was the first theory that addressed why the presence of others increased performance sometimes yet decreased it at other times. He argued that the presence of others serves as a source of arousal, and heightened arousal increases the likelihood of an organism to do better on well-learned or habitual responses. For this reason, arousal improves performance on simple, or well-learned tasks, but impairs performance on complex, or not well-learned tasks. Zajonc's reasoning was based on Yerkes-Dodson's law, which holds that performance works like an inverse "U" function. This means that an individual's optimal drive is higher for simpler, or well-practiced tasks, and that the same individual's optimal drive is lower for more complex, or less-practiced tasks. The presence of other people further arouses us and increases our drive level, and so an individual's performance will be enhanced if a task is simple (because of the high levels of energy) but diminished if the task is complex.&lt;ref name="Kirby" /&gt; He tested his theories by having people complete word association tasks alone and again in the presence of others, and found that the tasks were done much faster while in the presence of others.

Other activation theories include the alertness hypothesis, the monitoring hypothesis, and the challenge and threat hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

==== Alertness hypothesis ====
The alertness hypothesis says that people are uncertain of how observers will act while in the presence of others, so they become more alert (because the performer will be uncertain about how the observers will act in the situation). It is this heightened alertness which causes them to perform better on tasks.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

==== Monitoring hypothesis ====
The monitoring hypothesis posits that social facilitation effects do not occur when the performer is familiar with the observers or the situation. This is because, in those cases, the performer knows how the observer will respond or how the situation will take place. Therefore, in such situations the performer's arousal will not increase. So, if the person is unfamiliar with the observers or the situation, he/she will experience uncertainty and arousal will increase, but not if he/she is familiar with them.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

==== Challenge and threat hypotheses ====
The challenge and threat hypothesis states that people perform worse on complex tasks and better on simple tasks when in the presence of others because of the type of cardio-vascular response to the task. When performing a simple task in the presence of others, people show a normal cardiovascular response. However, when performing a complex task in the presence of others, the cardiovascular response is similar to that of a person in a threatening position. The normal cardiovascular response serves to improve performance, but the threat-like cardiovascular response serves to impede performance.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

=== Evaluation approach ===

In 1968, Henchy and Glass proposed the evaluation approach to social facilitation.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt; Their [[Evaluation apprehension model|evaluation apprehension hypothesis]] states that it is not the mere presence of others that increases individual activation/arousal, but rather the fear of being evaluated by an audience. They studied the reactivity of male high school and college students, where their responses were based on the strength they developed through prior training, and found that the groups who felt their performance was being evaluated had more dominant responses than the groups who were simply in the presence of an audience without being evaluated, or  those that were alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Evaluation apprehension and the social facilitation of dominant and subordinate responses.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1969-06839-001|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-11-30|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Learned drive hypothesis ====
A further extension of the evaluation approach is the learned drive hypothesis, which was developed by Cottrell, Wack, Sekerak, and Rittle, and states that activation only increases when actors feel that the audience is capable of evaluating their performance. In other words, it implies that the cause of evaluation apprehension comes from a learned audience. They studied how a participant performed on well-learned tasks while in the presence of an audience focused on another event, and in the presence of an audience focused on the tasks being performed. They found that participants performing in the latter group, with the audience that was focused on what the participants were doing, largely gave dominant responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wendyberrymendes.com/cms/uploads/Blascovich1999-%20Social%20facilit(2).pdf|title = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Blascovich, Mendes, Hunter|first = Jim, Wendy, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weiss and Miller furthered developed the evaluation approach by hypothesizing that activation only increases when the actors fear a negative evaluation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Basic Group Processes|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PJHbBwAAQBAJ|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 2012-12-06|isbn = 9781461255789|first = Paul|last = Paulus}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests that activation increases when the audience or other competitors cause negative feelings, such as anxiety, in the actor. However, Good's development of evaluation apprehension takes the opposite approach, where he hypothesizes that activation increases when actors expect a positive evaluation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Because of the conflicting theories under the evaluation approach, there has been controversy over its reliability. A meta-analysis done by Bond found that even when individuals are in the presence of a non-visible or non-evaluative audience, activation still occurs for an increase in dominant responses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bond | first1 = C. F. | last2 = Titus | first2 = L. J. | year = 1983 | title = Social facilitation: a meta-analysis of 241 studies | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 94 | issue = 2| page = 265 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.94.2.265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attention approach ===

In the 1980s, explanations shifted from activation theories to attention theories, which imply that withdrawal from some things is necessary in order to deal effectively with others. Attention theories that explain social facilitation include the [[distraction-conflict]] hypothesis, the overload hypothesis, the feedback-loop model, and the capacity model.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

==== Distraction-conflict hypothesis ====
In his distraction-conflict hypothesis, Robert Baron proposed that the level of performance on a task is predicted by the amount of [[distraction]]s in the environment surrounding the task. The hypothesis states that distraction leads to arousal, so the presence of others always impedes performance on difficult tasks, but the number of distractions in the environment either improves or impedes the performance on simple tasks.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

==== Overload hypothesis ====
The overload hypothesis works according to the distraction-conflict hypothesis, saying that distracters do not lead to increased arousal, but rather to [[cognitive load|cognitive overload]] (when an individual is bombarded with excessive information in their working memory),&lt;ref&gt;"Cognitive overload · Foviance." Foviance · customer experience, usability, web analytics, accessibility &amp; user research consultancy based in London, UK. N.p., n.d. Web. 24 Apr. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and while in cognitive overload, individuals will do worse on complex tasks and better on more simple tasks.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt; Performance increases on simple tasks because the performers focus their attention on the new stimuli, instead of the irrelevant stimuli that is characteristic of simple tasks. Performance decreases on complex tasks because the performers focus on the distracters, but also need to focus on the relevant stimuli that are characteristic of complex tasks, and they cannot handle all of the information they are being presented with.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

==== Feedback-loop model ====
The feedback-loop model postulates that when people feel they are being observed, they focus attention on themselves. While in this state, individuals become aware of the differences between their actual behavior and anticipated behavior. So, by feedback-loop model, people do better in the presence of others because of this increased awareness about their behavior.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

==== Capacity model ====
The capacity model of social facilitation focuses on the role of types of information processing on performance in front of an audience, rather than the performance on different type of tasks (simple or complex) in front of an audience. The capacity model suggests that for tasks that require automatic information processing, the presence of others does not cause problems because the short-term memory is not required for automatic information processing, so performance quality increases. However, for tasks that require controlled information processing, the presence of others does impede the level of performance because the short-term memory is necessary to both focus attention on the audience, as well as the task at hand.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

=== Self-presentation approach ===

The self-presentation approach to social facilitation has two main theories: one regarding arousal or drive, and one without. The first theory argues that in the presence of an audience, individuals become concerned with self-presentation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Social Facilitation|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qdq_G-VYev4C&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=self+presentation+approach+social+facilitation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=owwDWsDrnT&amp;sig=3xFatdwt_URTnBD_-TiMV2SYm6Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYn52k9bbJAhXBej4KHSftBpUQ6AEILzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=self%2520presentation%2520approach%2520social%2520facilitation&amp;f=false|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2009-09-17|isbn = 9780521119795|first = Bernard|last = Guerin|first2 = John|last2 = Innes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible embarrassment that occurs with negative evaluation leads to activation of arousal, or increased drive which will cause more dominant effects. The second theory argues that it is not an issue of arousal, but rather of simple responses, because the individual wants to appear competent in the presence of others. If the task is easy, the individual will want to make him/herself appear even more competent by doing exceptionally well on the task. However, if the task is difficult, they will fear that they will present themselves as incompetent, which will in turn make them embarrassed, and further impede their performance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

However, there has not been significant research done or evidence supporting the self-presentation approach. The main study looking at this approach was done by Bond in 1982, but it did not include independent measures of self-presentation, so it was not able to conclusively prove the validity of this approach.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Major empirical findings ==

=== Age ===
In 1898, Norman Triplett pioneered research on social facilitation by studying the competitive nature of children. In this study, each child was given a string and was told to wind it. He found that children performed much better while they were competing with one another, and further research led Triplett to theorize that the presence of others increases individuals' performances in other noncompetitive situations as well.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

In 1973, Chapman ran an experiment and found that levels of laughter among 7–8 year-old children were highest when two children listened to funny material together (coaction condition). Furthermore, levels of laughter were higher when one child listened to funny material in the presence of another child (audience condition) than when one child listened to the funny material alone (alone condition). These results indicate that laughter is also socially facilitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chapman | first1 = Antony J. | year = 1973 | title = Social Facilitation of Laughter in Children | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 6| pages = 528–541 | doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(73)90035-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender ===
In 1994, De Castro demonstrated that social facilitation affects food intake by extending the time spent eating a meal. His results also showed that the presence of family and friends, in comparison with the presence of mere companions, increases food intake to a greater degree, possibly due to the "release of inhibitory restraints on intake" that occurs when people feel more comfortable around people they are familiar with. Furthermore, males ate 36% more food when with other people than when alone, and females ate 40% more food when with other people than when alone. De Castro attributes this to the time-extension model of social facilitation, as the time spent at a meal increased when the meal was a social occasion. These results suggest that the presence of other people at a meal increases intake by extending the time spent at the meal, probably as a result of social interaction, and that family and friends have an even larger effect, probably by producing relaxation and a consequent disinhibition of restraint on intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Castro | first1 = John M. | year = 1994 | title = Family and friends produce greater social facilitation of food intake than other companions | url = | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 445–455 | doi = 10.1016/0031-9384(94)90286-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, these results also suggest that social facilitation has very similar effects on both men and women.

=== Performance ===
In 1920, when asked to write out as many words as possible in response to a given word, 93% of participants produced more words in the presence of another person than alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.uic.edu/labs/skitka/public_html/Teams.pdf|title = Automation Bias and Errors: Are Crews Better Than Individuals?|date = 2000|accessdate = |website = |publisher = THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AVIATION PSYCHOLOGY|last = Skitka, Mosier, Burdick, Rosenblatt|first = Linda J., Kathleen L., Mark, Bonnie}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when this study was replicated with individuals who stuttered when they spoke, 80% of the participants produced more words when alone rather than in the presence of another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Travis | first1 = L.E. | year = 1928 | title = The influence of the group upon the stutter's speed in free association | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 45–51 | doi = 10.1037/h0074512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee Edward Travis conducted a study to find what kind of effect an audience has on an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Travis|first= Lee Edward|date= July 1925|title= The effect of a small audience upon eye-hand coordination|url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/abn/20/2/142.pdf|journal= [[Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology]]|publisher= |volume= 20|issue= 2|pages= 142–146|doi= 10.1037/h0071311|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travis used an [[eye–hand coordination]] test (holding a flexible pointer on a revolving target) for his study. Twenty freshmen males, one sophomore male, and one junior male were used as the subjects. The small audience consisted of four to eight upper classmen and graduate students and was an equal number of men and women. Each observer practiced in the presence of the experimenter, and their learning curve was plotted each day. When the subject attained his maximum efficiency, the passive audience was brought in. Some of the subjects showed superior coordination when the audience was present.

In June 1980, Forgas et al. conducted a field study of audience effects, looking at the performance of expert and novice squash players when observed by no audience, a male audience, and a female audience. Contrary to Zajonc's drive-arousal theory, it was found that the effect of an audience on performance did not differ significantly between novice and expert players. This indicates that the other factors, such as cognitive variables and players' interpretation of the audience's presence, also influence players' reactions to the presence of an audience in a natural setting.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Forgas, Joseph P.|author2=Brennan, Greg|author3=Howe, Susan|author4=Fane, John F.|author5=Sweet, Shirley|date=June 1980|title=Audience Effects on Squash Players' Performance|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=111|issue=1|pp=41–47|doi=10.1080/00224545.1980.9924271|ISSN=0022-4545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, people playing pool were being surreptitiously watched in order to identify skilled and unskilled players. Skilled players made at least two-thirds of their shots whereas unskilled players missed at least two-thirds of their shots. When the observer moved closer to the pool table and continued to watch, skilled players' performance improved by 14% and the unskilled players' performance dropped by more than 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Michaels, J.W.|author2=Blommel, J.M.|author3=Brocato, R.M.|author4=Linkous, R.A.|author5=Rowe, J.S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1982|title=Social facilitation and inhibition in a natural setting|journal=Replications in social psychology|volume=2|pp=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Rosenbloom et al. studied archival data from Jerusalem in 2004 and found that the presence of an additional person in the car during a driving license test decreased the likelihood that the testee would pass the driving test. Although the nature of the study made it impossible to distinguish one explanation of social facilitation from another, the findings generally support the basic premise of social facilitation theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rosenbloom, Tova|author2=Shahar, Amit|author3=Perlman, Amotz|author4=Estreich, Dov|author5=Kirzner, Eyal|date=November 2007|title=Success on a practical driver's license test with and without the presence of another testee|journal=Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention|volume=39|issue=6|pp=1296–1301|doi=10.1016/j.aap.2007.03.015|pmid=17920854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, college students were given a list of words and told to copy them as quickly as they could. The "easy task" was to write out one list with their dominant hand and the "hard task" was to write out another list with their nondominant hand. While completing the task, they were in the presence of an image of their favorite television personality (displayed on a computer screen) or an image of another character from the same show. When given the easy task, they wrote more words in the presence of their favorite character and when given the hard task, the favorite character inhibited their performance. As shown, while the college students were given tasks, their favorite television characters are perceived as "real" in a social facilitation paradigm which gives evidence as to how social facilitation can affect performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gardner | first1 = Wendi L. | last2 = Knowles | first2 = M.L. | last3 = Megan | first3 = L. | year = 2008 | title = Love makes you real: Favorite television characters are perceived as 'real' in a social facilitation paradigm | url = | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 156–168 | doi = 10.1521/soco.2008.26.2.156 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Hill, Hanton, Matthews, and Fleming studied sub-optimal performance in spots, also known as the phenomenon of "choking". They determined that when individuals were worried about negative evaluations by the audience, and performing tasks that they were not familiar with, they often would perform at a lower level than when they did without an audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Choking in sport: a review|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17509840903301199|journal = International Review of Sport and Exercise Psychology|date = 2010-03-01|issn = 1750-984X|pages = 24–39|volume = 3|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/17509840903301199|first = Denise M.|last = Hill|first2 = Sheldon|last2 = Hanton|first3 = Nic|last3 = Matthews|first4 = Scott|last4 = Fleming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Anderson-Hanley, Snyder, Nimon, and Arciero found that older adults riding "cybercycles", virtual-reality enhanced stationary bikes with interactive competitions, exercised at higher rates than adults riding stationary bikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social facilitation in virtual reality-enhanced exercise: competitiveness moderates exercise effort of older adults|journal = Clinical Interventions in Aging|date = 2011-01-01|issn = 1176-9092|pmc = 3212419|pmid = 22087067|pages = 275–280|volume = 6|doi = 10.2147/CIA.S25337|first = Cay|last = Anderson-Hanley|first2 = Amanda L|last2 = Snyder|first3 = Joseph P|last3 = Nimon|first4 = Paul J|last4 = Arciero}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Muryama and Elliot conducted a meta-analysis where they found that the effects on performance commonly attributed to competition are actually due to performance goals. Competition prompts either performance-approach goals, which are what facilitate performance improvements, or performance-avoidance goals, which undermine performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The competition–performance relation: A meta-analytic review and test of the opposing processes model of competition and performance.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/138/6/1035/|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-11-30|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animals ===
Social facilitation in animals is when the performance of a behaviour by an animal increases the probability of other animals also engaging in that behaviour or increasing the intensity of the behaviour. In 1969, Zajonc, Heingartner, and Herman demonstrated that social facilitation occurs not only in humans, but also in species with limited or no cognitive processing. They observed that it takes a cockroach a longer time to complete a complex maze in the presence of other cockroaches than when alone. They also observed that in a simple, straight runway, a cockroach reaches the end of the runway faster in the presence of other cockroaches than when alone. This experiment lends support to the theory that physiological arousal resulting from the presence of others leads to similar social facilitation effects in animals as well.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zajonc | first1 = Robert B. | last2 = Heingartner | first2 = Alexander | last3 = Herman | first3 = Edward M. | year = 1969 | title = Social Enhancement and Impairment of Performance in the Cockroach | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 83–92 | doi = 10.1037/h0028063 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Dindo, Whiten, and de Waal studied the effect of social facilitation in capuchin monkeys. The monkeys in this study were required to complete a new foraging task, either alone or in a social group. While both sets of monkeys completed the task, those in the social group completed it three times faster than those monkeys that were alone. This increase in speed was attributed to "observational learning and synchronization of behavior between group mates."&lt;ref&gt;Dindo, Marietta; Whiten, Andrew; de Waal, Frans B. M.

== Electronic performance monitoring==

Researchers have used electronic performance monitoring (EPM) to examine the effects of social facilitation. This trend had previously been limited to face-to-face or group settings, but electronic performance monitoring establishes the impact of social facilitation in a virtual sense. EPM is the utilization of information technologies (e.g. computer networks) to track, evaluate, analyze, and report information regarding an employee's performance. Many businesses have adopted this method in which workers activity is automatically monitored throughout the workday. This topic is of substantial interest to those in the field of social psychology due to underlying mechanism at work; namely, the phenomenon of social facilitation.

One study found that EPM did enhance productivity, but only in ways that are consistent with the effects of social facilitation. Employees working on a data entry task were monitored while working alone, with others, or as part of a cohesive group. Results indicated that EPM improved the performance of highly skilled workers, but interfered with the performance of those who were less skilled. Moreover, with the exception of those working in a cohesive group, monitoring was found to increase workers' feelings of stress and anxiety. On the other hand, participants responded more favorably to performance monitoring when they believed that they could turn off the monitoring and that only their job-related activities were being evaluated. Also, EPM was viewed more positively when workers were given the opportunity to participate in decisions regarding the use of the system. Results support that the effect of social facilitation is not just limited to the physical presence of others, but also extends to presence in a virtual sense as well.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2009, Thompson, Sebastienelli and Murray conducted an experiment to determine the effect of electronic monitoring on students who used web-based training to learn new online search skills. They found that participants who were explicitly told that their training was being monitored performed markedly worse on a post-training skills test than participants who were unaware that their training was being monitored. These findings adhere to the basic premise of social facilitation and reveal that the heightened awareness of evaluation on complex tasks significantly hinders performance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== In educational settings ==

Groups are formed in a variety of educational settings around the world. Some examples include a group of physics students completing a laboratory exercise, a team of touch rugby players, a set of high school prefects, a group of students formed to brainstorm ideas for energy saving techniques, and [[study group]]s.

Some groups enhance members' motivation and help students stay focused on their academic goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillies|first=R.M.|title=Cooperative learning: Integrating theory and practice.|date=2007|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study group may inhibit the acquisition of new information, concepts, and skills, as the presence of others can be distracting. These distractions can interfere during the early phases of learning, both in overt and covert practicing. In a study in which participants had to learn a list of words, they were too embarrassed to rehearse the material out aloud and as a consequence of this group pressure, their performance suffered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Berger|first= Seymour M.|last2= Hampton|first2= Katherine L.|last3= Carli|first3= Linda L.|last4= Grandmaison|first4= Paul S.|last5= Sadow|first5= Janice S.|last6= Donath|first6= Clifford H.|last7= Herschlag|first7= Laura R.|title= Audience-Induced Inhibition of Overt Practice During Learning|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date= 1981|volume= 40|issue= 3|pages= 479–491|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.40.3.479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zajonc suggested that the student study alone, preferably in an isolated cubicle, and arrange to write examinations surrounded by many other students, on stage, and in the presence of a large audience. The results of the examination would be beyond the student's wildest expectations, assuming that the material had been thoroughly learned beforehand.&lt;ref name=Zajonc1965/&gt;

==Contributing factors==
Contributing factors to the audience effect could include what kind of crowd is present, such as a supportive crowd (e.g., the crowd at a team's home ground) or a hostile crowd (e.g., the crowd when a team is playing an away game). Also, the proximity of the crowd or the size of the crowd could influence the result of the audience effect. More factors such as nature of the task, coping skills with potential negative effects of audience, and even the playing venue (home or away) could be things to consider when examining the audience effect.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

Social facilitation is a widespread phenomenon in society. Many public tasks demonstrate the effects, both the costs and benefits, of social facilitation. From taking exams in a high school or college environment to performing in sporting events, people may perform better or fall short depending on the task's complexity. In many experiments, people display signs of social facilitation even in everyday tasks, such as driving. This effect can even be seen in animals, as displayed by Zajonc, Heingarter, and Herman's study on cockroaches.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Business can also use social facilitation to their advantage, specifically in online auctions, which takes into the account the emergence of instant messaging and communication availability technologies. The interaction between buyers and sellers in traditional, face-to-face markets creates phenomena such as social facilitation, where the presence of others impacts behaviour and performance. In the study involving Java-based Internet Dutch auction, the findings indicated that social facilitation does indeed occur and participants improve their results and stay longer in the auction under conditions of higher virtual presence. Participants also indicate a preference for auction arrangements with higher degrees of virtual presence.&lt;ref name="Rafaeli, S 2002"/&gt;

== Controversies ==

Social facilitation's definition and explanations are not without controversy. Social psychologists first debate whether social facilitation in humans can be through mere presence, or whether it must be through evaluation. It was concluded that although the influence of the mere presence of others can be easily concealed by many other complex social factors, it is one of the variables that contributes to the power of others to influence an individual's performance.&lt;ref name="Markus1978"/&gt;

One of the greatest controversies surrounding social facilitation is its origination. Psychologists continue to debate whether social facilitation is adopted through the innate biology of humans and animals, or through social learning, either from interaction with society or from individual interaction with other people, and not society in general. Further research and expansion of experiments and theories may begin to resolve, or further complicate, these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = Do-Yeong | last2 = Park | first2 = Junsu | year = 2010 | title = Cultural differences in risk: The group facilitation effect | url = | journal = Judgment and Decision Making | volume = 5 | issue = 5| pages = 380–390 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of certain weaknesses and inadequacies of drive theory explanation, social facilitation is argued to be in need for a more cognitive approach. A more cognitive model constructed in an expectancy theory framework is shown as a plausible alternative explanation for employee performance and the effects of social facilitation. While there is not much evidence presented by this controversy it is recommended that direction of future research should test this model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Beehr, Terry A.|author2=Ferris, Gerald R.|author3=Gilmore, David C.|year=1978|title=Social Facilitation: A Review and Alternative Conceptual Model|journal=The Academy of Management Review|volume=3|issue=2|pp=338–347|jstor=257673|doi=10.5465/amr.1978.4295344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, there is difficulty in determining which social facilitation approach is the most accurate. The biggest conflict comes between the activation (or mere presence) and evaluation approaches, with the activation approach stating that the mere presence of an audience leads to social facilitation, and the evaluation approach stating that it is the fear of being judged by a capable audience that leads to social facilitation. Despite the two clearly conflicting schools of thought, researchers have not been able to conclusively prove which one is correct.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Stepan Andriyovych Bandera''' ({{lang-uk|Степан Андрійович Бандера}}, {{lang-pl|Stepan Andrijowycz Bandera}}; 1 January 1909 – 15 October 1959) was a head of a militant wing of [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|Ukrainian independence movement]]&lt;ref name="marples"&gt;David R.

"Bandera was, according to his handlers, “a professional underground worker with a terrorist background and ruthless notions about the rules of the game.... A bandit type if you like, with a burning patriotism, which provides an ethical background and a justification for his banditry. No better and no worse than others of his kind....”"&lt;/ref&gt; and a leader of the terrorist activity of Ukrainian nationalists.&lt;ref name="marples"/&gt;

Born in [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Austrian Galicia]], into the family of a [[Greek-Catholic]] priest, he became nationalistic from an early age. After the [[dissolution of Austria-Hungary]] Galicia became a short-lived [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]], but [[Polish–Ukrainian War|was quickly annexed by Poland]] and was [[Polonization#West Ukraine|subjected to an extensive campaigns of Polonization]] and [[Pacification of Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia|Pacification]]. He became radicalised during this time, and after Polish authorities refused his request to leave for Czechoslovakia for studying, he enrolled in [[Lviv Polytechnic]] where he organized several nationalistic organizations. He was imprisoned in 1934 and was sentenced to death, but his sentence was quickly commuted to life imprisonment. He escaped prison in 1939 when the [[Second Polish Republic]] collapsed after [[Invasion of Poland|the joint Nazi-Soviet invasion]] and moved to the [[General Government|German-occupied zone]].

When [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] he allied himself with them, but after he [[Declaration of Ukrainian State Act|attempted to proclaim an independent Ukrainian state]], the [[Gestapo]] put him under [[house arrest]] on 5 of July 1941&lt;ref&gt;''Киричук Юрій.''

==Early life==
Bandera was born in Uhryniv Staryi, Galicia, Austria-Hungary. He attended the Fourth Form Grammar School in [[Stryi]].&lt;ref name="exlibris.org.ua"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation from high school in 1927, he planned to attend the Ukrainian College of Technology and Economics in [[Podebrady]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], but the Polish authorities did not grant him travel papers.&lt;ref&gt;Ukrainian College of Technology and Economics in Podebrady&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Bandera enrolled in the agronomy program at the [[Lviv Polytechnic]] (then Politechnika Lwowska).&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofukraine.com"&gt;

==Pre-WWII activity==

===Early activities===
Stepan Bandera had met and associated himself with members of a variety of Ukrainian nationalist organizations throughout his schooling—from [[Plast]], to the [[Union for the Liberation of Ukraine]] ({{lang-ua|Українська Визвольна Організація}}) and also the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] (OUN) ({{lang-ua|Організація Українських Націоналістів}}). The most active of these organizations was the OUN, and the leader of the OUN was [[Andriy Atanasovych Melnyk|Andriy Melnyk]].&lt;ref name="exlibris.org.ua"/&gt;

Because of his determined personality, Stepan Bandera quickly rose through the ranks of these organizations, becoming the chief propaganda officer of the OUN in 1931, the second in command of OUN in Galicia in 1932–33, and the head of the National Executive or the OUN in 1933.&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofukraine.com"/&gt;

For Bandera, an inclusive policy of nation building was important and therefore, he focused on growing support amongst all classes of Ukrainians in Western parts of Ukraine. In the early 1930s, Bandera was very active in finding and developing groups of Ukrainian nationalists in both Western and Eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref name="exlibris.org.ua"/&gt;

===OUN===
Stepan Bandera became head of the OUN national executive in Galicia in June 1933. He expanded the OUN's network in the [[Kresy]], directing it against both Poland and the Soviet Union. To stop expropriations, Bandera turned OUN against the Polish officials who were directly responsible for [[Polonization|anti-Ukrainian policies]]. Activities included mass campaigns against Polish tobacco and alcohol monopolies and against the denationalization of Ukrainian youth. He was arrested in Lviv in 1934, and tried twice: first, concerning involvement in a plot to assassinate the minister of internal affairs, [[Bronisław Pieracki]], and second at a general trial of OUN executives. He was convicted of terrorism and sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofukraine.com"/&gt;

The death sentence was commuted to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofukraine.com"/&gt; He was held in [[Wronki Prison]]; in 1938 some of his followers tried unsuccessfully to break him out of the jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} Janusz Marciszewski, [http://wielkopolska.naszemiasto.pl/turystyka/specjalna_artykul/15004.html Uwolnić Banderę] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703045814/http://wielkopolska.naszemiasto.pl/turystyka/specjalna_artykul/15004.html |date=3 July 2009 }}, NaszeMiasto.pl&lt;/ref&gt;

According to various sources, Bandera was freed in September 1939, either by Ukrainian jailers after Polish jail administration left the jail,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kray.ridne.net/bandera|title="Мої життєписні дані" (автобіографія Степана Бандери) - Наші Герої - архів матеріалів і фотографій ОУН-УПА|website=Kray.ridne.net|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Poles&lt;ref&gt;T.

Soon thereafter Eastern Poland fell under Soviet occupation. Upon release from prison, Bandera moved to Kraków, the capital of Germany's occupational [[General Government]]. There, he came in contact with the leader of the OUN, [[Andriy Atanasovych Melnyk|Andriy Melnyk]]. In 1940, the political differences between the two leaders caused the OUN to split into two factions—the [[OUN-M|Melnyk]] faction led by [[Andriy Atanasovych Melnyk|Andriy Melnyk]], which preached a more conservative approach to nation-building, (also known as the OUN-M), and the [[OUN-B|Bandera]] faction led by S. Bandera, which supported a revolutionary approach, (also known as the OUN-B).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/612921/Ukraine/30082/World-War-II-and-its-aftermath#ref=ref404610 |title=Ukraine :: World War II and its aftermath – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |website=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of Mobile Groups===
Before the independence proclamation of 30 June 1941, Bandera oversaw the formation of so-called "Mobile Groups" ({{lang-ua|мобільні групи}}) which were small (5–15 members) groups of OUN-B members who would travel from [[General Government]] to Western Ukraine and after German advance to Eastern Ukraine to encourage support for the OUN-B and establishing the local authorities ruled by OUN-B activists.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;ОУН в 1941 році: документи: В 2-х ч Ін-т історії України НАН України К. 2006 {{ISBN|966-02-2535-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, approximately 7,000 people participated in these mobile groups, and they found followers among a wide circle of intellectuals, such as [[Ivan Bahriany]], [[Vasyl Barka]], [[Hryhorii Vashchenko]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= By Sviatoslav LYPOVETSKY |url=http://www.day.kiev.ua/264657/ |title=Eight decades of struggle /ДЕНЬ/ |website=Day.kiev.ua |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
OUN leaders [[Andriy Atanasovych Melnyk|Andriy Melnyk]] and Bandera were recruited before World War II into the Nazi Germany military intelligence [[Abwehr]] for espionage, counter-espionage and sabotage. Their goal was to run diversion activities after Germany's attack on the Soviet Union. Melnyk was given code name 'Consul I'. This information is part of the testimony that Abwehr Colonel Erwin Stolze gave on 25 December 1945 and submitted to the Nuremberg trials, with a request to be admitted as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/tgmwc-06/tgmwc-06-56-12.html|title=Nuremberg - The Trial of German Major War Criminals (Volume VI)|website=Nizkor.org|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WGAexVXyHwC&amp;pg=PA322|title=Canaris: The Life and Death of Hitler's Spymaster|first=Michael|last=Mueller|date=18 August 2018|publisher=Naval Institute Press|accessdate=18 August 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1941, Bandera held meetings with the heads of Germany's intelligence, regarding the formation of "[[Nachtigall Battalion|Nachtigall]]" and "[[Roland Battalion|Roland]]" Battalions. In spring of that year the OUN received 2.5&amp;nbsp;million marks for subversive activities inside the USSR.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="history.org.ua"&gt;Організація українських націоналістів і Українська повстанська армія.

[[Gestapo]] and [[Abwehr]] officials protected Bandera followers, as both organizations intended to use them for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;p.15 ОУН в 1941 році: документи: В 2-х ч Ін-т історії України НАН України К. 2006 {{ISBN|966-02-2535-0}}  – У владних структурах рейху знайшлися сили яки з прагматичних міркувань стали на захист бандерівців. Керівники гестапо сподівалися використовувати їх у власних цілях а керівники абверу а радянському тилу.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 1941, with the arrival of Nazi troops in Ukraine, Bandera and the OUN-B declared an independent Ukrainian State ("Act of Renewal of Ukrainian Statehood").&lt;ref name="RudlingMyth"/&gt; This declaration was accompanied by violent porgoms.&lt;ref name="RudlingMyth"/&gt; Some of the published proclamations of the formation of this state say that it would "work closely with the [[Nazi Germany|National-Socialist Greater Germany]], under the leadership of its leader [[Adolf Hitler]] which is forming a [[New Order (political system)|new order in Europe and the world]] and is helping the Ukrainian People to free itself from [[Soviet Union|Moscovite occupation]]." – as stated in the text of the "[[Declaration of Ukrainian Independence, 1941|Act of Proclamation of Ukrainian Statehood]]".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1940"/&gt;

Bandera's expectation that Nazi regime would ''post factum'' recognize an independent fascist Ukraine as the Axis ally proved to be wrong.&lt;ref name="RudlingMyth"/&gt; In 1941 relations between Nazi Germany and the OUN-B had soured to the point where a Nazi document dated 25 November 1941 stated that "... the Bandera Movement is preparing a revolt in the Reichskommissariat which has as its ultimate aim the establishment of an independent Ukraine. All functionaries of the Bandera Movement must be arrested at once and, after thorough interrogation, are to be liquidated...".&lt;ref name="InfoUkes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoukes.com/history/ww2/page-08.html |title=Ukrainian History – World War II in Ukraine |publisher=InfoUkes |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 July, Bandera was transferred to Berlin. On 12 July, the prime minister of the newly formed [[Ukrainian national government (1941)|Ukrainian National Government]], [[Yaroslav Stetsko]], was also arrested and taken to Berlin. Although released from custody on 14 July, both were required to stay in Berlin. On 15 September 1941 Bandera and leading OUN members were arrested by the Gestapo.

In January 1942, Bandera was transferred to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]'s special barrack for high-profile political prisoners Zellenbau.&lt;ref name="Berkhoff, K.C. 1999 pp. 149"&gt;[[Karel C.

In April 1944, Bandera and his deputy [[Yaroslav Stetsko]] were approached by an [[Reich Main Security Office]] official to discuss plans for diversions and sabotage against the Soviet Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Завдання підривної діяльності проти Червоної армії обговорювалося на нараді під Берліном у квітні того ж року (1944) між керівником таємних операцій вермахту О.Скорцені й лідерами українських націоналістів С.бандерою та Я.Стецьком" |author=D.

==Postwar activity==
According to [[Stephen Dorril]], author of ''MI6: Inside the Covert World of Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service'', OUN-B was re-formed in 1946 under the sponsorship of [[MI6]]. The organization had been receiving some support from MI6 since the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Dorril, Stephen, ''MI6: Inside the Covert World of Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service'', Simon and Schuster, 2002, pp. 224, 233&lt;/ref&gt; One faction of Bandera's organization, associated with [[Mykola Lebed]], became more closely associated with the [[CIA]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorril, Stephen, ''MI6: Inside the Covert World of Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service'', Simon and Schuster, 2002, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Bandera himself was the target of an extensive and aggressive search carried out by [[Counterintelligence Corps|CIC]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/iwg/reports/hitlers-shadow.pdf Richard Breitman, Norman J.W.

After the Bavarian state government initiated a crackdown on it, Bandera agreed with the [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]] offering them his service, despite CIA warning the West Germans against cooperating with him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/iwg/reports/hitlers-shadow.pdf Richard Breitman, Norman J.W.

In May 1941 at a meeting in [[Kraków]] the leadership of Bandera's OUN faction adopted the program "Struggle and action for OUN during the war" ({{lang-uk|"Боротьба й діяльність ОУН під час війни"}}) which outlined the plans for activities at the onset of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union and the western territories of the Ukrainian SSR.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;І.К.

In late 1942, when Bandera was in a German concentration camp, his organization, the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]], was involved in a [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia]], and in early 1944, ethnic cleansings also spread to Eastern Galicia. It is estimated that more than 35,000 and up to 60,000&lt;ref&gt;Grzegorz Motyka, ''Od rzezi wołyńskiej do akcji "Wisła'', Kraków 2011, {{ISBN|978-83-08-04576-3}}, s.447, Ewa Siemaszko estimates victims to be 133,000 in ''Stan badań nad ludobójstwem dokonanym na ludności polskiej przez Organizację Ukraińskich Nacjonalistów i Ukraińską Powstańczą Armię'', Bogusław Paź (red.), ''Ludobójstwo na Kresach południowo-wschodniej Polski w latach 1939–1946'', Wrocław 2011, {{ISBN|978-83-229-3185-1}}, s.341.&lt;/ref&gt; Poles, mostly women and children along with unarmed men, were killed during the spring and summer campaign of 1943 in Volhynia, and up to 100,000 if other regions (Eastern Galicia) are included.&lt;ref name="SNYDER2"&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/cis/www/migration/pubs/rrwp/9_resolve.html To Resolve the Ukrainian Question Once and For All: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ukrainians in Poland, 1943–1947], Timothy Snyder, Working Paper, Yale University, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Od rzezi wołyńskiej do akcji "Wisła", 2011, pages 447–448&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the central role played by Bandera's followers in the massacre of Poles in western Ukraine, Bandera himself was interned in a German concentration camp when the concrete decision to massacre the Poles was made and when the Poles were killed.  According to [[Yaroslav Hrytsak]], during his internment, from the summer of 1941, he was not completely aware of events in Ukraine and moreover had serious differences of opinion with [[Mykola Lebed]], the OUN-B leader who remained in Ukraine and who was one of the chief architects of the massacres of Poles.&lt;ref name = "hrycak1"&gt;[http://wyborcza.pl/magazyn/1,136498,15363017,Romantyczny_terrorysta.html Bandera – romantyczny terrorysta] "Bandera – Romantic Terrorist, interview with Jaroslaw Hrycak.

===Jews===
Unlike competing Polish, Russian, Hungarian or Romanian nationalisms in late [[Austrian Empire|imperial Austria]], [[Russian Empire|imperial Russia]], [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]] and Romania, [[Ukrainian nationalism]] did not include antisemitism as a core aspect of its program and saw Russians as well as Poles as the chief enemy with Jews playing a secondary role.&lt;ref name="himka"&gt;[http://www.zwoje-scrolls.com/zwoje16/text11.htm Ukrainian Collaboration in the Extermination of the Jews during the Second World War: Sorting Out the Long-Term and Conjunctural Factors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106044835/http://www.zwoje-scrolls.com/zwoje16/text11.htm |date=6 January 2012 }} by John-Paul Himka, University of Alberta.

Jonathan Frankel (New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), Studies in Contemporary Jewry 13 (1997): 170–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Ukrainian nationalism was not immune to the influence of the antisemitic climate in the Eastern and Central Europe,&lt;ref name="himka"/&gt; that had already become highly racialized in the late 19th century, and had developed an elaborate anti-Jewish discourse.&lt;ref&gt;p.16 [https://archive.org/details/warCriminalityABlankSpotInTheCollectiveMemoryOfTheUkrainian "War Criminality: A Blank Spot in the Collective Memory of the Ukrainian Diaspora."] ''Spaces of Identity'' 5, no. 1 (April 2005) by [[John-Paul Himka]], [[University of Alberta]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hostility to both the Soviet central government and the Jewish minority were highlighted at the OUN-B's Conference in [[Kraków]] in May 1941, at which the leadership of Bandera's OUN faction adopted the program "Struggle and action of OUN during the war" ({{lang-uk|"Боротьба й діяльність ОУН під час війни"}}) which outlined the plans for activities at the onset of the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]] and the western territories of the Ukrainian SSR.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The program declared that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Jews in the USSR constitute the most faithful support of the ruling Bolshevik regime, and the vanguard of Muscovite imperialism in Ukraine. The Muscovite-Bolshevik government exploits the anti-Jewish sentiments of the Ukrainian masses to divert their attention from the true cause of their misfortune and to channel them in a time of frustration into pogroms on Jews. The OUN combats the Jews as the prop of the Muscovite-Bolshevik regime and simultaneously it renders the masses conscious of the fact that the principal foe is Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;[[Filip Friedman|Philip Friedman]].  "Ukrainian-Jewish Relations during the Nazi Occupation," in Philip Friedman and Ada June Friedman (eds.), ''Roads to Extinction: Essays on the Holocaust'' (New York: Conference on Jewish Social Studies, [[Jewish Publication Society of America]], 1980). pp.179–180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section G of the program – "Directives for organizing the life of the state during the first days" ({{lang-uk|"Вказівки на перші дні організації державного життя"}}) outlined activity of the Bandera followers during mid-1941.&lt;ref name="autogenerated56"/&gt; In a subsection on "Minority Policy", the leaders of OUN-B ordered:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Moskal]]i [i.e. ethnic Russians], Poles, and Jews that are hostile to us are to be destroyed in struggle, particularly those opposing the regime, by means of: deporting them to their own lands, eradicating their intelligentsia, which is not to be admitted to any governmental positions, and overall preventing any creation of this intelligentsia (e.g. access to education etc)...  Jews are to be isolated, removed from governmental positions in order to prevent sabotage... Those who are deemed necessary may only work under strict supervision and removed from their positions for slightest misconduct... Jewish assimilation is not possible.&lt;ref&gt;Меншинева політика.

латинського обряду, насильно асимільовані. Проводирів нищити. Жидів ізолювати, поусувати з урядів, щоб уникнути саботажу, тим більше москалів і поляків. Коли б була непоборна потреба оставити, приміром, в
господарськім апараті жида, поставити йому нашого міліціянта над головою і ліквідувати за найменші провини. Керівники поодиноких галузей життя можуть бути лише українці, а не чужині – вороги.

==Death==
[[File:Stepan Bandera’s grave.jpg|thumb|Bandera's grave in Munich, April 2014]]
On 15 October 1959, Stepan Bandera collapsed outside of Kreittmayrstrasse 7 in [[Munich]] and died shortly thereafter.  A medical examination established that the cause of his death was poison by [[cyanide]] gas.&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892820,00.html The Partisan], [[Time (magazine)|Time]] (2 November 1959)&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October 1959, Stepan Bandera was buried in the [[Waldfriedhof Cemetery]] in Munich. His grave was desecrated on 17 August 2014 by unknown vandals, who toppled the 1.8 m cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ria.ru/world/20140817/1020356348.html|title = Неизвестные опрокинули крест на могиле Степана Бандеры в Мюнхене|date = 17 August 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Ria Novosti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after his death, on 17 November 1961, the German judicial bodies announced that Bandera's murderer had been a KGB defector named [[Bohdan Stashynsky]] who acted on the orders of Soviet [[KGB]] head [[Alexander Shelepin]] and Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938806,00.html The Poison Pistol], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', 1 December 1961&lt;/ref&gt; After a detailed investigation against Stashynsky, a trial took place from 8 to 15 October 1962. Stashynsky was convicted, and on 19 October he was sentenced to eight years in prison.

==Family==
Bandera's brother Aleksandr (who had a PhD in Political Economy from the University of Rome) and brother Vasyl (a graduate in Philosophy, Lviv University) were arrested by Germans and interned in [[Auschwitz]], where they were allegedly killed by Polish inmates in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;p.190 The Frankfurt Auschwitz trial, 1963–1965: genocide, history, and the limits Devin Owen Pendas Cambridge University Press [https://books.google.com/books?id=BUKGSlqKUkMC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=Franziska+Bruder:+%3E%3EDer+Gerechtigkeit+zu+dienen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IjzdAnwGyy&amp;sig=HxfJIwGaFPlU3fFB9k8N-RSNNP8&amp;hl=ru&amp;ei=IydnS-bvD5CImAOpgJ0m&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Franziska%20Bruder%3A%20%3E%3EDer%20Gerechtigkeit%20zu%20dienen&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Andriy Bandera, Stepan's father, was arrested by Soviets in late May 1941 for harboring an OUN member and transferred to [[Kiev]]. On 8 July he was sentenced to death and executed on the 10th. His sisters Oksana and Marta–Maria were arrested by the [[NKVD]] in 1941 and sent to a [[GULAG]] in Siberia. Both were released in 1960 without the right to return to Ukraine. Marta–Maria died in [[Siberia]] in 1982, and Oksana returned to Ukraine in 1989 where she died in 2004. Another sister, Volodymyra, was sentenced to a term in Soviet labor camps from 1946–1956. She returned to Ukraine in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gk-press.if.ua/node/512|title=Бандерштадт: місто Бандер - Галицький Кореспондент|date=22 January 2009|website=Gk-press.if.ua|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Russian newspaper ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' in 2005, former KGB Chief [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]] claimed that "the murder of Stepan Bandera was one of the last cases when the KGB disposed of undesired people by means of violence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mosnews.com/interview/2005/12/06/kgbchief.shtml Mosnews.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060205191647/http://www.mosnews.com/interview/2005/12/06/kgbchief.shtml |date=5 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2006 the [[Lviv]] city administration announced the future transference of the tombs of Stepan Bandera, [[Andriy Atanasovych Melnyk|Andriy Melnyk]], [[Yevhen Konovalets]] and other key leaders of [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]/[[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] to a new area of [[Lychakivskiy Cemetery]] specifically dedicated to victims of the repressions of the Ukrainian national liberation struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1161553853 |title=Information website of the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group |website=Khpg.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attitudes in Ukraine towards Bandera===
[[File:Бандера - наш герой.jpg|thumb|Lviv soccer fans at a game against Donetsk. The banner reads in Ukrainian, "Bandera – our hero"]]
Bandera continues to be a divisive figure in Ukraine. Although Bandera is venerated in certain parts of western Ukraine, and 33% of [[Lviv]]'s residents consider themselves to be followers of Bandera,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasiareview.com/201009128124/in-western-ukraine-even-ethnic-russians-vote-for-pro-ukrainian-parties.html In Western Ukraine, Even Ethnic Russians Vote for Pro-Ukrainian Parties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913150701/http://www.eurasiareview.com/201009128124/in-western-ukraine-even-ethnic-russians-vote-for-pro-ukrainian-parties.html |date=13 September 2010 }} by Paul Goble, Eurasia Review. 12 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in surveys of Ukraine as a whole he, along with [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], is considered among the three historical figures who produce the most negative attitudes.&lt;ref name = "Hrytsak"&gt;[[Yaroslav Hrytsak]].

Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]]. pp. 185–209&lt;/ref&gt; A national survey conducted in Ukraine in 2009 inquired about attitudes by region towards Bandera's faction of the OUN. It produced the following results: In Galicia (provinces of [[Lviv]], [[Ternopil]], and [[Ivano-Frankivsk]]) 37% had a "very positive" opinion of Bandera, 26% a "mostly positive" opinion, 20% were "neutral", 5% "mostly negative", 6% "very negative", and 6% "unsure". In [[Volhynia]], 5% had a very positive opinion, 20% a mostly positive opinion, 57% were neutral, 7% were mostly negative, 5% very negative and 6% were unsure. In [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Transcarpathia]] 4% of the respondents had a very positive opinion, 32% a mostly positive opinion, 50% were neutral, none had a mostly negative opinion, 7% had a very negative opinion and 7% were unsure. In contrast, in central Ukraine (comprising the capital [[Kiev]], as well as the provinces of [[Zhytomyr]], [[Cherkasy]], [[Chernihiv]], [[Poltava]], [[Sumy]], [[Vinnytsia]], and [[Kirovohrad]]) attitudes towards Bandera's faction of the OUN were 3% very positive, 10% mostly positive, 24% neutral, 17% mostly negative, 21% very negative and 25% unsure. In Eastern Ukraine (the provinces of [[Donetsk]], [[Luhansk]], [[Kharkiv]], [[Dnipropetrovsk]] and [[Zaporizhia]]) 1% each had very positive or mostly positive attitudes towards Bandera's OUN, 19% were neutral, 13% mostly negative, 26% very negative and 20% unsure. In Ukraine's south (the [[Odessa]], [[Mykolaiv]] and [[Kherson]] regions plus [[Crimea]]) 1% each were very or mostly positive, 13% were neutral, 31% mostly negative, 48% very negative and 25% were unsure. In Ukraine as a whole, 6% of Ukrainians had a very positive opinion, 8% a mostly positive opinion, 23% were neutral, 15% had a mostly negative opinion, 30% had a very negative opinion, and 18% were unsure.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Katchanovski.

On 22 January 2010, on the ''[[Day of Unity of Ukraine]]'', the then-[[President of Ukraine]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] awarded to Bandera the title of [[Hero of Ukraine]] (posthumously) for "defending national ideas and battling for an independent Ukrainian state."&lt;ref name="kyivpost.com"&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/57781/ Stepan Bandera becomes Ukrainian hero], [[Kyiv Post]] (22 January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; A grandson of Bandera, also named Stepan, accepted the award that day from the Ukrainian President during the state ceremony to commemorate the ''Day of Unity of Ukraine'' at the [[National Opera House of Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="kyivpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrcu.gov.ua/index.php?id=148&amp;listid=109625 President Viktor Yushchenko awarded title Hero of Ukraine to OUN Head Stepan Bandera] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206131125/http://nrcu.gov.ua/index.php?id=148&amp;listid=109625 |date=6 December 2010 }}, [[Radio Ukraine]] (22 January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photo.unian.net/eng/themes/16236 Events by themes: {{sic|9|1th|nolink=y}} anniversary of Collegiality of Ukraine], [[UNIAN]] (22 January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarussia.com/posts/778 Ukraine.

On 9 February 2010, the Poland's [[Senate Marshal]] [[Bogdan Borusewicz]] said at a meeting with the head of [[Federation Council of Russia|Russia's Federation Council]] [[Sergei Mironov]], that adaptation of the Hero title of Ukraine to Bandera is an internal matter of the Ukrainian government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrpohliad.org/news.php/news/2331 Ukrainsky pohliad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727024057/http://www.ukrpohliad.org/news.php/news/2331 |date=27 July 2011 }} (Ukrainian view) 9 February 2010 {{uk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] stated on 5 March 2010 he would make a decision to repeal the decrees to honor the title as Heroes of Ukraine to Bandera and fellow nationalist [[Roman Shukhevych]] before the next [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/61110/ Yanukovych to strip nationalists of hero status], [[Kyiv Post]] (5 March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; although the Hero of Ukraine decrees do not stipulate the possibility that a decree on awarding this title can be annulled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/59788/ Party of Regions proposes legal move to strip Bandera of Hero of Ukraine title], [[Kyiv Post]] (17 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 April 2010, an administrative [[Donetsk]] region court ruled the Presidential decree awarding the title to be illegal. According to the court's decision, Bandera wasn't a citizen of the Ukrainian SSR (vis-à-vis Ukraine).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/64630/ Donetsk court deprives Shukhevych of Ukrainian hero title], [[Kyiv Post]] (21 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HACShukhevych&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/78249/ High Administrative Court dismisses appeals against illegal award of Hero of Ukraine title to Soviet soldiers], [[Kyiv Post]] (13 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://top.rbc.ru/society/02/04/2010/388200.shtml Ukraine court strips Bandera of Hero of Ukraine title], Top RBC (2 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gzt.ru/topnews/world/-sud-donetska-lishil-banderu-zvaniya-geroya-/299737.html?from=rotationnews Ukraine court strips Bandera of Hero of Ukraine title because he wasn't citizen of Ukraine], Gzt.ru (3 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 April 2010, the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine]] refused to start constitutional proceedings on the constitutionality of the President Yushchenko decree the award was based on.

The '''streetlight effect''', or the '''drunkard's search''' principle, is a type of [[observational bias]] that occurs when people only search for something where it is easiest to look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[David H.

::A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his keys and they both look under the streetlight together. After a few minutes the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them here, and the drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the park. The policeman asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, "this is where the light is".&lt;ref name=wrong/&gt;

The anecdote goes back at least to the 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;"'Did You Lose the Keys Here?'

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3435">A '''sunshine list''' is a listing of salary, benefit and severance information.&lt;ref name="calgarysun.com"&gt;[http://www.calgarysun.com/2014/03/20/alberta-premier-alison-redford-leaves-mixed-legacy-behind "Alberta Premier Alison Redford Leaves Mixed Legacy Behind]&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the list is commonly used for example by provincial or municipal governments to identify any publicly employed person making $100,000 salary or higher.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/sunshine-list-2014-ontario-s-top-public-earners-list-released-1.2590152 CBC News "Sunshine List 2014: Ontario's Top Public Earners List Released"]&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the list is to provide accountability and transparency, requiring "organizations that receive public funding from the Province of Ontario to disclose annually the names, positions, salaries and total taxable benefits of employees paid $100,000 or more in a calendar year."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/publications/salarydisclosure/pssd/ Government of Ottawa Salary Disclosure Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Alberta===
Alberta first started publishing a sunshine list in 2014 following the 2012 election of [[Alison Redford]]. The introduction of the list followed public debate about the severance awarded to Redford's former chief of staff.&lt;ref name="calgarysun.com"/&gt; In Alberta, the policy applies to deputy ministers, senior officials, political staff appointed under the Executive Assistant Order and employees defined under the Public Service Act who work for the offices of ministers and associate ministers, and who make an annual base salary of at least $100,000. The government began disclosing base salaries, benefit and severance amounts, and details of contract and termination agreements beginning on 31 January 2014. Information was to be posted online twice annually no later than 30 June and 31 December and included all staff employed as of 23 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140819012327/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/news-views/news/sunshine-list-11654/ FFWD weekly article]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ontario===
Ontario introduced the sunshine list in 1996 under the [[Mike Harris]] government.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt;

==Uses==
While intended as an accountability tool, the lists have been used for other purposes. ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine, for example, has used the list to examine employment equity in academia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macleans.ca/education/uniandcollege/knocking-on-the-glass-ceiling/ "Knocking on the Glass Ceiling"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flaw==
In 2011, Chris Mazza, President and CEO of [[Ornge]], managed to stay off the sunshine list while making $1.4 million per year in a controversial scandal.&lt;ref name="Star22Dec11"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1105806--ornge-president-was-paid-1-4-million-per-year|title = ORNGE president was paid $1.4 million per year|accessdate = 2 February 2012|last = Donovan|first = Kevin|date = 22 December 2011| work = [[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He stressed that the white race was invented as "a ruling class social control formation."&lt;ref name="perryintro"&gt;{{cite book | last = Perry | first = Jeffrey B. | chapter = Introduction | editor-last = Allen | editor-first = Theodore W. | title = Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race | url = http://clogic.eserver.org/2006/allen.html |publisher= Center for the Study of Working Class Life, SUNY, Stony Brook | location = Stony Brook, NY |origyear=1975 |year=2006 | oclc = 244189582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent, working-class scholar, Allen did research for the next quarter century to expand and document his ideas, particularly on the relation of [[white supremacy]] to the working class. He published a two-volume work, ''The Invention of the White Race'' (1994 and 1997): "The Invention of the White Race," Vol. 1: "Racial Oppression and Social Control" (1994, 2012)&lt;ref name="Intervention_Vol_I"&gt;{{cite book | last = Allen | first = Theodore W. | title = The Invention of the White Race: Volume 1, Racial Oppression and Social Control | url = http://www.versobooks.com/books/1039-the-invention-of-the-white-race-volume-1 |publisher=Verso Books | location = London |origyear=1994 |year=2012| isbn = 9781844677696}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Invention of the White Race," Vol. 2: "The Origin of Racial Oppression in Anglo-America" (1997, 2012);&lt;ref name="Intervention_Vol_II"&gt;{{cite book | last = Allen | first = Theodore W. | title = The Invention of the White Race: Volume 2, The Origin of Racial Oppression in Anglo-America | url = http://www.versobooks.com/books/1048-the-invention-of-the-white-race-volume-2 |publisher=Verso Books | location = London |origyear=1997 |year=2012| isbn = 9781844677702}}&lt;/ref&gt; which explored racial oppression as a system of social control (in Volume 1) and the origin of racial oppression in Anglo-America (in Volume 2). It was republished by [[Verso Books]] in a new expanded edition in November 2012.&lt;ref name="Intervention_Vol_I" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Intervention_Vol_II" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Theodore William Allen was born into a [[middle-class]] family in Indianapolis, Indiana. He had a sister Eula May and brother Tom; their parents were Thomas E.  Allen, a sales manager, and Almeda Earl Allen, a housewife. The family moved when he was a child to [[Paintsville, Kentucky]], and then to [[Huntington, West Virginia]], where he lived and, in his words, "was proletarianized" during the [[Great Depression]]. When Allen started working soon after high school (deciding that college did not do enough for independent thought), he quickly joined labor unions.&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

==Career==
Allen became an early activist and organizer in the labor movement. At age 17, he joined the [[American Federation of Musicians]] Local 362 and the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Haywood | first = Harry | authorlink = Harry Haywood | chapter = Introduction | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bHc44CrYKccC&amp;pg=PR21 | editor-first = Gwendolyn | editor-last = Midlo Hall | editorlink = Gwendolyn Midlo Hall | title = A Black Communist in the Freedom Struggle: The Life of Harry Haywood | page = xxi | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 2012 |origyear=1978 | isbn = 9780816679058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Staudenmaier | first = Michael | chapter = "A Science of Navigation" | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uQSmXBV5R9YC&amp;pg=PA84 | title = Truth and Revolution: A History of the Sojourner Truth Organization 1968 - 1986 | page = 84 | publisher = AK Press | location = Oakland, California, Edinburgh, and Baltimore | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781849350976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon was elected as a delegate to the Huntington Central Labor Union, AFL. He subsequently worked as a coal miner in West Virginia as a member of the United Mine Workers, serving as an organizer and president of one Local and later member of another. He also co-developed a trade union organizing program for the Marion County, West Virginia Industrial Union Council, [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]].&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

In the 1940s Allen moved to New York City, a center for labor activism and intellectual work. He did industrial economic research at the [[Labor Research Association]], based in the city. He taught economics at the [[Jefferson School of Social Science]], founded in New York by the Communist Party in 1944. Allen taught there into the 1950s, when the school closed, due to declining membership in the party and pressure from scrutiny by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) of Congress, which was conducting hearings during the [[McCarthy era]].

Allen also taught math at the Crown Heights Yeshiva in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], where he lived, and the Grace Church School in New York.&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt; During his more than six decades in New York, Allen had a variety of jobs, from factory worker to retail clerk, mechanical design draftsman, postal mail handler (and member of the Local of the National Postal Mail Handlers Union), and librarian at the Brooklyn Public Library.&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

Beginning in 1965, he was published as an independent scholar. He conducted decades of research to develop his ideas about the labor, class and racial history of the United States.&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

==Writings==
In 1965 Allen published articles on the concept of [[white skin privilege]]&lt;ref&gt;Allen urged, in a 1965 John Brown Commemoration Committee "Call," that "[[White Americans]] who want government of the people, by the people, must begin by first repudiating their white skin privileges and the white 'gentleman's agreement' against the [[Negro]]."

He explored this in "''White Blindspot''" and "''Can White &lt;s&gt;Workers&lt;/s&gt; Radicals Be Radicalized?''" (1967, 1967), co-authored with [[Noel Ignatiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ignatin (Ignatiev) | first1 = Noel | last2 = Allen | first2 = Ted | chapter = White Blindspot | chapter-url = http://www.sds-1960s.org/WhiteBlindspot.pdf | editor-last = Davidson | editor-first = Carl | title = Revolutionary Youth &amp; the New Working Class: the Praxis Papers, the Port Authority Statement, the RYM Documents and Other Lost Writings of SDS | pages = 148&amp;ndash;181 | publisher = Changemaker Publications | location = Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781257999477 }}

After beginning his research on "white skin privilege" in 1965, Allen worked for the next decade to develop more research and writing on this topic. He published ''Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race'' (1975). During this time, he also taught as an adjunct history instructor for one semester at Essex County Community College in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. He was described by historian Jeffrey B. Perry as working "throughout his entire adult life ... for the emancipation of the working class and for socialism."&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

His work since the 1960s was intended to overturn explanations for [[white supremacy]] that relied on biology or attributed it to benefits gained by the working class. Allen emphasized that the "invention of the white race" was related to class struggle and to ruling class efforts to maintain social control.&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

Allen published outside the academic press and his work was highly influential, at a time of the [[civil rights movement]], when issues of race, ethnicity and culture were being studied and overturned. He also documented how later Irish immigrants to the U.S. became "white."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Allen | first = Theodore W. | title = The Invention of the White Race: Volume 1, Racial Oppression and Social Control | url = http://www.versobooks.com/books/1039-the-invention-of-the-white-race-volume-1 |publisher=Verso Books | location = London |origyear=1994 |year=2012| isbn = 9781844677696}} Chapters 6 through 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "race" was also being overturned by work in anthropology, genetics, biology, history and other disciplines. By 1997, historian [[George M. Fredrickson]] of [[Stanford University]] wrote that "the proposition that race is 'a social and cultural construction,' has become an academic cliché,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Frederickson | first = George M. | title = America's Caste System: Will It Change? | journal = [[New York Review of Books]] | page = 68 | publisher =  | date = 23 October 1997 | url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1997/oct/23/americas-caste-system-will-it-change/ | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Allen was not satisfied with that proposition and he emphasized that "the 'white race' must be understood, not simply as a social construct (rather than an genetic phenomenon), but as a ruling class social control formation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Allen | first = Theodore W. | title = Summary of the Argument of "''The Invention of the White Race''" (Part One) | journal = Cultural Logic: Marxist Theory and Practice | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | publisher = Theodore W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2357">The '''Todhri alphabet''' is an 18th-century Albanian alphabet invented for writing the [[Albanian language]] by Dhaskal Todhri (born [[Theodor Haxhifilipi|Theodor (Todhri) Haxhifilipi]]).&lt;ref name="Pollo1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stefanaq Pollo|title=Historia e Shqipërisë: Vitet 30 të shek.

The Todhri alphabet was discovered in Elbasan by [[Johann Georg von Hahn]] (1811–1869) who published it in 1854 his work Albanesische Studien in [[Jena]].&lt;ref name="Hahn2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johann Georg Hahn|title=The Discovery of Albania: Travel Writing and Anthropology in the Nineteenth Century Balkans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2U7WCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|date=30 May 2015|publisher=I.B.Tauris|page=8|isbn=9781784532925}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered it to be 'the original' Albanian alphabet and a derivative of ancient [[Phoenician script]]. [[Leopold Geitler]] (1847–1885) and [[Slovenians|Slovenian]] scholar [[Rajko Nahtigal]] (1877–1958) subsequently studied the alphabet, concluding that it was derived primarily from the [[Roman cursive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elsie|first=Robert|title=The Elbasan Gospel Manuscript (Anonimi i Elbasanit), 1761, and the struggle for an original Albanian alphabet|url=http://www.elsie.de/pdf/articles/A1995ElbasanMs_Fig.pdf|website=elsie.de|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest existing text in Todhri's script is '''Radhua Hesapesh''' ([[Bookkeeping#Daybooks|daybook]]) of a local merchant partnership known as Jakov Popa i Vogël dhe Shokët (Jakov Popa Junior and Friends). The entries in Todhri's script start on 10 August 1795 and continue until 1797.&lt;ref name="Shuteriqi1976"&gt;{{citation| author=Dhimiter Shuteriqi| page=140|location = Tirana| year=1976| oclc=252881121 | publisher= Academy of Sciences of PR of Albania| title=Shkrimet Shqipe ne Vitet 1332-1850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1769">In [[philosophy]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] '''transcendental apperception''' is that which [[Immanuel Kant]] thought makes experience possible.&lt;ref&gt;Glendinning (1999, 26, 40-41).&lt;/ref&gt; It is where the [[Self (philosophy)|self]] and the [[World (philosophy)|world]] come together.

Transcendental apperception is the uniting and building of coherent consciousness out of different elementary inner experiences (differing in both time and topic, but all belonging to self-consciousness). E.g. the experience of "passing of time" relies on this transcendental unity of apperception, according to Kant.

There are six steps to transcendental apperception:

#All experience is the succession of a variety of contents (an idea taken from [[David Hume]]).
#To be experienced at all, the successive data must be combined or held together in a unity for consciousness.
#Unity of experience therefore implies a unity of self.
#The unity of self is as much an object of experience as anything is.
#Therefore, experience both of the self and its objects rests on acts of synthesis that, because they are the conditions of any experience, are not themselves experienced.
#These prior syntheses are made possible by the [[Category (Kant)|categories]]. Categories allow us to synthesize the self and the objects.

The term was later adapted in psychology by [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]], see [[Apperception]].

[[File:angle-fractions.png|250px|thumb|right|Counterclockwise [[rotation]]s about the center point where a complete rotation is equal to 1 turn]]

A '''turn''' is a unit of [[plane angle]] measurement equal to 2[[Pi|{{pi}}]] [[radian]]s, 360 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] or 400 [[gradian]]s.  A turn is also referred to as a '''cycle''' (abbreviated '''cyc'''), '''revolution''' (abbreviated '''rev'''), '''complete rotation''' (abbreviated '''rot''') or '''full circle'''.

Subdivisions of a turn include half turns, quarter turns, centiturns, milliturns, [[Points of the compass|points]], etc.

==Subdivision of turns==

A turn can be divided in 100 centiturns or {{gaps|1|000}} milliturns, with each milliturn corresponding to an [[angle]] of 0.36°, which can also be written as 21′&amp;thinsp;36″. A [[protractor]] divided in centiturns is normally called a [[percentage]] protractor.

[[Binary scaling#Binary angles|Binary fractions of a turn]] are also used. Sailors have traditionally divided a turn into 32 [[points of the compass|compass points]]. The ''binary degree'', also known as the ''[[binary radian]]'' (or ''brad''), is {{frac|256}} turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oopic.com/pgchap15.htm |title=ooPIC Programmer's Guide |publisher=www.oopic.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628051746/http://www.oopic.com/pgchap15.htm |archivedate=2008-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The binary degree is used in computing so that an angle can be represented to the maximum possible precision in a single [[byte]]. Other measures of angle used in computing may be based on dividing one whole turn into 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; equal parts for other values of ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnhar/archive/2010/01/04/angles-integers-and-modulo-arithmetic.aspx |title=Angles, integers, and modulo arithmetic |author-first=Shawn |author-last=Hargreaves |publisher=blogs.msdn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of turn is commonly used for [[plane (geometry)|planar]] rotations.

== History ==
The word turn originates via Latin and French from the Greek word {{lang|grc|τόρνος}} ({{grc-tr|τόρνος}} – a [[lathe]]).

In 1697, [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]] used {{sfrac|{{pi}}|ρ}} (pi over rho) to denote the [[Perimeter|perimeter]] of a circle (i.e., the [[circumference]]) divided by its radius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-first=Petr |author-last=Beckmann |author-link=Petr Beckmann |title=A History of Pi |title-link=A History of Pi |publisher=[[Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing]] |date=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-first=Steven |author-last=Schwartzman |title=The Words of Mathematics: An Etymological Dictionary of Mathematical Terms Used in English |publisher=[[The Mathematical Association of America]] |date=1994 |page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, earlier in 1647, [[William Oughtred]] had used {{sfrac|δ|{{pi}}}} (delta over pi) for the ratio of the diameter to perimeter. The first use of the symbol {{pi}} on its own with its present meaning (of perimeter divided by diameter) was in 1706 by the [[Wales|Welsh]] mathematician [[William Jones (mathematician)|William Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.veling.nl/anne/templars/Pi_through_the_ages.html |title=Pi through the ages}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euler]] adopted the symbol with that meaning in 1737, leading to its widespread use.

Percentage protractors have existed since 1922,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-first=Frederick E. |author-last=Croxton |date=1922 |title=A Percentage Protractor |journal=[[Journal of the American Statistical Association]] |volume=18 |pages=108–109 |doi=10.1080/01621459.1922.10502455}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the terms centiturns and milliturns were introduced much later by [[Fred Hoyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-first=Fred |author-last=Hoyle |author-link=Fred Hoyle |title=Astronomy |publisher=Macdonald |location=London |date=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German standard [[DIN 1315]] (1974-03) proposed the unit symbol ''pla'' (from Latin: ''plenus angulus'' "full angle") for turns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbuch SI-Einheiten: Definition, Realisierung, Bewahrung und Weitergabe der SI-Einheiten, Grundlagen der Präzisionsmeßtechnik |author-first1=Sigmar |author-last1=German |author-first2=Peter |author-last2=Drath |publisher=[[Friedrich Vieweg &amp; Sohn Verlagsgesellschaft mbH]], reprint: [[Springer-Verlag]] |language=German |date=2013-03-13 |orig-year=1979 |edition=1 |isbn=3322836061 |id=978-3-528-08441-7, 9783322836069 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63qcBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA421 |access-date=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Das Vieweg Einheiten-Lexikon: Formeln und Begriffe aus Physik, Chemie und Technik |author-first=Peter |author-last=Kurzweil |language=German |publisher=Vieweg, reprint: [[Springer-Verlag]] |edition=1 |date=2013-03-09 |orig-year=1999 |isbn=3322929205 |id=978-3-322-92921-1 |doi=10.1007/978-3-322-92920-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zecBgAAQBAJ |access-date=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, the [[HP 39gII]] and [[HP Prime]] support the unit symbol ''tr'' for turns. In 2016, support for turns was also added to [[newRPL]] for the [[HP 50g]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/thread-4783-post-55836.html#pid55836&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, for release 3.6, the [[Python programming language]] adopted the name ''tau'' to represent the number of radians in a turn.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0628/&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard [[ISO 80000-3]]:2006 mentions that the unit name revolution with symbol r is used with rotating machines, as well as using the term ''turn'' to mean a full rotation.  The standard [[IEEE Std 260.1-2004|IEEE 260.1:2004]] also uses the unit name rotation and symbol ''r''.

== Unit conversion ==
[[File:2pi-unrolled.gif|400px|thumb|right|The [[circumference]] of the [[unit circle]] (whose [[radius]] is one) is 2{{pi}}.]]

One turn is equal to 2{{pi}} (≈&amp;nbsp;{{gaps|6.283|185|307|179|586}})&lt;ref&gt;Sequence {{OEIS2C|A019692}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[radian]]s.

{{Table of angles}}

==Tau proposals==

[[File:Circle_radians_tau.gif|thumb|200px|right|An arc of a circle with the same length as the radius of that circle corresponds to an angle of 1&amp;nbsp;radian. A full circle corresponds to a full turn, or approximately 6.28&amp;nbsp;radians, which are expressed here using the Greek letter tau ({{mvar|&amp;tau;}}).]]

In 2001, Robert Palais proposed using the number of radians in a turn as the fundamental circle constant instead of {{pi}}, which amounts to the number of radians in half a turn, in order to make mathematics simpler and more intuitive. His proposal used a "pi with three legs" symbol to denote the constant (&lt;math&gt;\pi\!\;\!\!\!\pi&lt;/math&gt; = 2{{pi}}).&lt;ref name="palais"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.math.utah.edu/%7Epalais/pi.pdf |author-first=Robert |author-last=Palais |date=2001 |title=Pi is Wrong |journal=[[The Mathematical Intelligencer]] |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |location=New York, USA |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=7–8 |doi=10.1007/bf03026846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Michael Hartl proposed to use [[tau]] to represent Palais' circle constant: {{math|1=''&amp;tau;'' = 2''&amp;pi;''}}. He offered two reasons. First, {{mvar|&amp;tau;}} is the number of radians in ''one turn'', which allows fractions of a turn to be expressed more directly: for instance, a {{sfrac|3|4}}&amp;nbsp;turn would be represented as {{math|{{sfrac|3|4}}''&amp;tau;''}}&amp;nbsp;rad instead of {{math|{{sfrac|3|2}}''&amp;pi;}}&amp;nbsp;rad. Second, {{mvar|&amp;tau;}} visually resembles {{pi}}, whose association with the circle constant is unavoidable.&lt;ref name="tauday"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto |title=The Tau Manifesto |author-first=Michael |author-last=Hartl |date=2013-03-14 |access-date=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartl's ''Tau Manifesto''&lt;ref&gt;https://hexnet.org/files/documents/tau-manifesto.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; gives many examples of formulas that are asserted to be clearer where tau is used instead of pi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author-first=Jacob |author-last=Aron |date=2011-01-08 |title=Interview: Michael Hartl: It's time to kill off pi |journal=[[New Scientist]] |volume=209 |issue=2794 |doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(11)60036-5 |bibcode=2011NewSc.209...23A |pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author-first=Elizabeth |author-last=Landau |date=2011-03-14 |title=On Pi Day, is 'pi' under attack? |work=cnn.com |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/03/14/pi.tau.math/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/let-s-use-tau-it-s-easier-than-pi/ |title=Why Tau Trumps Pi |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=2014-06-25 |access-date=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{mvar|&amp;tau;}}-functionality is made available in the Google calculator and in several programming languages like Python&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url|url=https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html|title=Python 3.7.0 documentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Perl&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url|url=https://docs.perl6.org/language/terms|title=Perl 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Processing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url|url=https://processing.org/reference/TAU.html|title=Processing}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Nim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url|url=https://nim-lang.org/docs/math.html|title=Nim}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It has also been used in at least one mathematical research article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harremoës |first1=Peter |title=Bounds on tail probabilities for negative binomial distributions |journal=Kybernetika |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=943-966 |doi=10.14736/kyb-2016-6-0943}}&lt;/ref&gt; authored by the {{mvar|&amp;tau;}}-promoter {{nowrap|[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Harremoes P.

 |url        = http://www.harremoes.dk/Peter/Undervis/Turnpage/Turnpage1.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, none of these proposals have received widespread acceptance by the mathematical and scientific communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110630/jsp/nation/story_14178997.jsp|title=Life of pi in no danger – Experts cold-shoulder campaign to replace with tau|journal=Telegraph India|date=2011-06-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713084345/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110630/jsp/nation/story_14178997.jsp|archivedate=13 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of use ==
* As an angular unit, the turn or revolution is particularly useful for large angles, such as in connection with [[electromagnetic coil]]s and [[rotation|rotating]] objects. See also [[winding number]].
* The angular speed of rotating machinery, such as automobile engines, is commonly measured in [[revolutions per minute]] or RPM.
* Turn is used in [[complex dynamics]] for measure of [[external ray|external]] and internal angles. The sum of external angles of a polygon equals one turn. Angle [[doubling map]] is used. 
* [[Pie chart]]s illustrate proportions of a whole as fractions of a turn. Each one percent is shown as an angle of one centiturn.

==Kinematics of turns==
In [[kinematics]], a '''turn''' is a rotation less than a full revolution.
A turn may be represented in a [[mathematical model]] that uses expressions of [[complex number]]s or [[quaternion]]s. In the [[complex plane]] every non-zero number has a [[polar coordinate]] expression {{nowrap|1=''z'' = ''r'' [[cis (mathematics)|cis]](''a'') = ''r'' cos(''a'') + ''r''i sin(''a'')}} where {{nowrap|''r'' &gt; 0}} and ''a'' is in {{nowrap|[0, 2{{pi}})}}.
A turn of the complex plane arises from multiplying {{nowrap|1=''z'' = ''x'' + i''y''}} by an element {{nowrap|1=''u'' = e&lt;sup&gt;''b''i&lt;/sup&gt;}} that lies on the [[unit circle]]:
: ''z'' ↦ ''uz''.
[[Frank Morley]] consistently referred to elements of the unit circle as ''turns'' in the book ''Inversive Geometry'', (1933) which he coauthored with his son Frank Vigor Morley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inversive Geometry |author-first1=Frank |author-last1=Morley |author-link1=Frank Morley |author-first2=Frank Vigor |author-last2=Morley |orig-year=1933 |date=2014 |publisher=Ginn and Company, reprint: [[Courier Corporation]], [[Dover Publications]] |location=Boston, USA; New York, USA |isbn=978-0-486-49339-8 |id=0-486-49339-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gu8WAgAAQBAJ |access-date=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin term for ''turn'' is [[versor]], which is a [[quaternion]] that can be visualized as an [[arc (geometry)|arc]] of a [[great circle]]. The product of two versors can be compared to a [[spherical triangle]] where two sides add to the third.

In [[computer science]], '''[[type conversion]]''', '''type casting''', and '''type coercion''' are different ways of changing an entity of one [[data type]] into another. An example would be the conversion of an [[integer (computer science)|integer]] value into a [[floating point]] value or its textual representation as a [[string (computer science)|string]], and vice versa. Type conversions can take advantage of certain features of [[type hierarchy|type hierarchies]] or [[data representation]]s. Two important aspects of a type conversion is whether it happens ''implicitly'' or ''explicitly'', and whether the underlying data representation is converted from one representation into another, or a given representation is merely ''reinterpreted'' as the representation of another data type. In general, both [[primitive data type|primitive]] and [[compound data type]]s can be converted.

Each [[programming language]] has its own rules on how types can be converted. Languages with [[strong typing]] typically do little implicit conversion and discourage the reinterpretation of representations, while languages with [[weak typing]] perform many implicit conversions between data types.  Weak typing language often allow forcing the [[compiler]] to arbitrarily interpret a data item as having different representations—this can be a non-obvious programming error, or a technical method to directly deal with underlying hardware.

In most languages, the word ''coercion'' is used to denote an ''implicit'' conversion, either during compilation or during [[run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]]. For example, in an expression mixing integer and floating point numbers (like 5 + 0.1), the compiler will automatically convert integer representation into floating point representation so fractions are not lost. Explicit type conversions are either indicated by writing additional code (e.g. adding type identifiers or calling built-in [[Subroutine|routines]]) or by coding conversion routines for the compiler to use when it otherwise would halt with a type mismatch.

In most [[ALGOL]]-like languages, such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Modula-2]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] and [[Delphi (programming language)|Delphi]], ''conversion'' and ''casting'' are distinctly different concepts. In these languages, ''conversion'' refers to either implicitly or explicitly changing a value from one data type storage format to another, e.g. a 16-bit integer to a 32-bit integer. The storage needs may change as a result of the conversion, including a possible loss of precision or truncation. The word ''cast'', on the other hand, refers to explicitly changing the ''interpretation'' of the ''bit pattern'' representing a value from one type to another. For example, 32 contiguous bits may be treated as an array of 32 booleans, a 4-byte string, an unsigned 32-bit integer or an IEEE single precision floating point value. Because the stored bits are never changed, the programmer must know low level details such as representation format, byte order, and alignment needs, to meaningfully cast.

In the C family of languages and [[ALGOL 68]], the word ''cast'' typically refers to an ''explicit'' type conversion (as opposed to an implicit conversion), causing some ambiguity about whether this is a re-interpretation of a bit-pattern or a real data representation conversion.  More important is the multitude of ways and rules that apply to what data type (or class) is located by a pointer and how a pointer may be adjusted by the compiler in cases like object (class) inheritance.

== Language comparison ==

===C-like languages===

====Implicit type conversion====
Implicit type conversion, also known as ''coercion'', is an automatic type conversion by the [[compiler]]. Some [[programming language]]s allow compilers to provide coercion; others require it.

In a mixed-type expression, data of one or more [[Subtyping|subtype]]s can be [[Type conversion in C|converted]] to a supertype as needed at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|runtime]] so that the program will run correctly. For example, the following is legal [[C (programming language)|C language]] code:

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
double  d;
long    l;
int     i;

if (d &gt; i)   d = i;
if (i &gt; l)   l = i;
if (d == l)  d *= 2;
&lt;/source&gt;

Although {{mono|'''d'''}}, {{mono|'''l'''}}, and {{mono|'''i'''}} belong to different data types, they will be automatically converted to equal data types each time a comparison or assignment is executed. This behavior should be used with caution, as [[unintended consequences]] can arise. Data can be lost when converting representations from floating-point to integer, as the fractional components of the floating-point values will be truncated (rounded toward zero). Conversely, precision can be lost when converting representations from integer to floating-point, since a floating-point type may be unable to exactly represent an integer type. For example, {{C-lang|float}} might be an [[IEEE 754]] single precision type, which cannot represent the integer 16777217 exactly, while a 32-bit integer type can. This can lead to unintuitive behavior, as demonstrated by the following code:

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    int i_value   = 16777217;
    float f_value = 16777216.0;
    printf("The integer is: %d\n", i_value);
    printf("The float is:   %f\n", f_value);
    printf("Their equality: %d\n", i_value == f_value);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

On compilers that implement floats as IEEE single precision, and ints as at least 32 bits, this code will give this peculiar print-out:

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
    The integer is: 16777217
    The float is: 16777216.000000
    Their equality: 1
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that 1 represents equality in the last line above. This odd behavior is caused by an implicit conversion of {{C-lang|i_value}} to float when it is compared with {{C-lang|f_value}}. The conversion causes loss of precision, which makes the values equal before the comparison.

Important takeaways:

# {{C-lang|float}} to {{C-lang|int}} causes [[truncation]], i.e., removal of the fractional part.
# {{C-lang|double}} to {{C-lang|float}} causes rounding of digit.
# {{C-lang|long}} to {{C-lang|int}} causes dropping of excess higher order bits.

=====Type promotion=====
One special case of implicit type conversion is type promotion, where the compiler automatically expands the binary representation of objects of integer or floating-point types. Promotions are commonly used with types smaller than the native type of the target platform's [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU), before arithmetic and logical operations, to make such operations possible, or more efficient if the ALU can work with more than one type. C and C++ perform such promotion for objects of boolean, character, wide character, enumeration, and short integer types which are promoted to int, and for objects of type float, which are promoted to double. Unlike some other type conversions, promotions never lose precision or modify the value stored in the object.

In [[Java (programming language)|Java]]:
&lt;source lang=java&gt;
int x = 3;
double y = 3.5;
System.out.println(x+y); //The output will be 6.5
&lt;/source&gt;

====Explicit type conversion====
Explicit type conversion is a type conversion which is explicitly defined within a program (instead of being done by a compiler for implicit type conversion). It is defined by the user in the program.

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
double da = 3.3;
double db = 3.3;
double dc = 3.4;
int result = (int)da + (int)db + (int)dc; //result == 9
//if implicit conversion would be used (as with "result = da + db + dc"), result would be equal to 10
&lt;/source&gt;

There are several kinds of explicit conversion.

; checked: Before the conversion is performed, a runtime check is done to see if the destination type can hold the source value. If not, an error condition is raised.
; unchecked: No check is performed. If the destination type cannot hold the source value, the result is undefined.
; bit pattern: The raw bit representation of the source is copied verbatim, and it is re-interpreted according to the destination type. This can also be achieved via [[Aliasing (computing)|aliasing]].

In [[object-oriented programming]] languages, objects can also be [[downcasting|downcast]] : a reference of a base class is cast to one of its derived classes.

===C# and C++===
In [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], type conversion can be made in a safe or unsafe (i.e., C-like) manner, the former called ''checked type cast''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=Csharp&gt;
Animal animal = new Cat();

Bulldog b = (Bulldog) animal;   // if (animal is Bulldog), stat.type(animal) is Bulldog, else an exception
b = animal as Bulldog;          // if (animal is Bulldog), b = (Bulldog) animal, else b = null

animal = null;
b = animal as Bulldog;          // b == null
&lt;/source&gt;

In [[C++]] the similar effect can be achieved using ''C++-style cast syntax''.

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
Animal* animal = new Cat;

Bulldog* b = static_cast&lt;Bulldog*&gt;(animal); // compiles only if either Animal or Bulldog is derived from the other (or same)
b = dynamic_cast&lt;Bulldog*&gt;(animal);         // if (animal is Bulldog), b = (Bulldog*) animal, else b = nullptr

animal = nullptr;
b = dynamic_cast&lt;Bulldog*&gt;(animal);         // b == nullptr
&lt;/source&gt;

===Eiffel===

In [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] the notion of type conversion is integrated into the rules of the type system. The Assignment Rule says that an assignment, such as:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
 x := y
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
is valid if and only if the type of its source expression, &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; in this case, is ''compatible with'' the type of its target entity, &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in this case. In this rule, ''compatible with'' means that the type of the source expression either ''conforms to'' or ''converts to'' that of the target. Conformance of types is defined by the familiar rules for [[polymorphism in object-oriented programming]]. For example, in the assignment above, the type of &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; conforms to the type of &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; if the class upon which &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is based is a descendant of that upon which &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is based.

====Definition of type conversion in Eiffel====
The actions of type conversion in Eiffel, specifically ''converts to'' and ''converts from'' are defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A type based on a class CU ''converts to'' a type T based on a class CT (and T ''converts from'' U) if either
:CT has a ''conversion procedure'' using U as a conversion type, or
:CU has a ''conversion query'' listing T as a conversion type
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Example====

Eiffel is a fully compliant [[List of CLI languages|language]] for Microsoft [[.NET Framework]]. Before development of .NET, Eiffel already had extensive class libraries. Using the .NET type libraries, particularly with commonly used types such as strings, poses a conversion problem. Existing Eiffel software uses the string classes (such as &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;STRING_8&lt;/code&gt;) from the Eiffel libraries, but Eiffel software written for .NET must use the .NET string class (&lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;System.String&lt;/code&gt;) in many cases, for example when calling .NET methods which expect items of the .NET type to be passed as arguments. So, the conversion of these types back and forth needs to be as seamless as possible.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
    my_string: STRING_8                 -- Native Eiffel string
    my_system_string: SYSTEM_STRING     -- Native .NET string

        ...

            my_string := my_system_string
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In the code above, two strings are declared, one of each different type (&lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;SYSTEM_STRING&lt;/code&gt; is the Eiffel compliant alias for System.String). Because &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;System.String&lt;/code&gt; does not conform to &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;STRING_8&lt;/code&gt;, then the assignment above is valid only if &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;System.String&lt;/code&gt; converts to &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;STRING_8&lt;/code&gt;.

The Eiffel class &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;STRING_8&lt;/code&gt; has a conversion procedure &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;make_from_cil&lt;/code&gt; for objects of type &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;System.String&lt;/code&gt;. Conversion procedures are also always designated as creation procedures (similar to constructors). The following is an excerpt from the &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;STRING_8&lt;/code&gt; class:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
    class STRING_8
        ...
    create
        make_from_cil
        ...
    convert
        make_from_cil ({SYSTEM_STRING})
        ...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The presence of the conversion procedure makes the assignment:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
            my_string := my_system_string
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

semantically equivalent to:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
            create my_string.make_from_cil (my_system_string)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

in which &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;my_string&lt;/code&gt; is constructed as a new object of type &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;STRING_8&lt;/code&gt; with content equivalent to that of &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;my_system_string&lt;/code&gt;.

To handle an assignment with original source and target reversed:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
            my_system_string := my_string
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

the class &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;STRING_8&lt;/code&gt; also contains a conversion query &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;to_cil&lt;/code&gt; which will produce a &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;System.String&lt;/code&gt; from an instance of &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;STRING_8&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
    class STRING_8
        ...
    create
        make_from_cil
        ...
    convert
        make_from_cil ({SYSTEM_STRING})
        to_cil: {SYSTEM_STRING}
        ...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The assignment:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
            my_system_string := my_string
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

then, becomes equivalent to:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
            my_system_string := my_string.to_cil
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In Eiffel, the setup for type conversion is included in the class code, but then appears to happen as automatically as [[#Explicit type conversion|explicit type conversion]] in client code. The includes not just assignments but other types of attachments as well, such as argument (parameter) substitution.

==Security issues==
In [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]], typecasting is the misuse of type conversion to temporarily change a [[variable (computer science)|variable]]'s data type from how it was originally defined.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Erickson ''Hacking, 2nd Edition: The Art of Exploitation'' 2008 1593271441 p51   "Typecasting is simply a way to temporarily change a variable's data type, despite how it was originally defined. When a variable is typecast into a different type, the compiler is basically told to treat that variable as if it were the new data type, but only for that operation. The syntax for typecasting is as follows: (typecast_data_type) variable ..."&lt;/ref&gt; This provides opportunities for hackers since in type conversion after a variable is "typecast" to become a different data type, the compiler will treat that hacked variable as the new data type for that specific operation.&lt;ref&gt;Arpita Gopal ''Magnifying C'' 2009 8120338618 p.59 "From the above, it is clear that the usage of typecasting is to make a variable of one type, act like another type for one single operation. So by using this ability of typecasting it is possible for create ASCII characters by typecasting integer to its ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''United States v. Enmons''''', {{Ussc|410|396|1973|el=no}}, was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that the federal Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934, known as the [[Hobbs Act]],  does not cover [[union violence]] in furtherance of the union's objectives.

The case involved a labor strike in which members of the [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers]] (IBEW) fired rifles at three utility company transformers, drained the oil from another, and blew up a company substation. The labor union in question was seeking a higher-pay contract and other benefits from their employer, the [[Gulf States Utilities|Gulf States Utilities Company]] which is now part of [[Entergy]]. The federal government tried the defendants under the Hobbs Act.  

The Court ruled that "The Hobbs Act, which makes it a federal crime to obstruct interstate commerce by robbery or extortion, does not reach the use of violence (which is readily punishable under state law) to achieve legitimate union objectives, such as higher wages in return for genuine services that the employer seeks."&lt;ref name="United States v. Enmons"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNITED STATES, Appellant, v. Travis Paul ENMONS et al.|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/396|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=May 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details of the case==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2018}}
The indictment against the alleged conspirators charged them with being in violation of the [[Hobbs Act]], which states that anyone attempting to affect or obstruct commerce through violence or the threat of violence against any person or property "''shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both''." The indictment argued that the union members obstructed commerce with their actions against the Utilities Company, and attempted to "''obtain the property of [their employer] in the form of wages and other things of value''" by using the wrongful use of force and the fear of economic loss.

The court acknowledged that using threats and force to obtain property is wrongful. However, the court reasoned that it is considered "wrongful" only when the perpetrator has no "legitimate claim" to it. Since federal law empowers unions with the right to [[Strike action|strike]], the use of violence to secure higher pay and benefits was not [[extortion]]. The case was dismissed. Such violent acts can, however, be punishable under normal state or federal laws. 

In understanding Enmons, it is important to keep in mind that what the Hobbs Act outlaws is extortion, not just any bad act. Federal law, in particular the [[National Labor Relations Act]], says that collective bargaining and strikes in support of collective bargaining goals are legal and protected. Therefore, since collective bargaining has a purpose that is not extortion, one of the key elements of a Hobbs Act violation is not met.

==Controversy==
While labor unions as a whole are exempt from prosecution, individual members can still be held accountable and prosecuted according to local laws. However, evidence suggests that this rarely is the case. According to a 1998 policy analysis by the [[Cato Institute]],&lt;ref name="Kendrick"&gt;[https://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=1175 Freedom from Union Violence, Cato Institute Policy Analysis no. 316, September 9, 1998 by David Kendrick]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The result has been an epidemic of union-related violence. The National Institute for Labor Relations Research (NILRR) has recorded 8,799 incidents of violence from news reports since [the Enmons ruling]. Those reports show only 258 convictions, suggesting a conviction rate of less than 3 percent. Moreover, local law enforcement authorities often get many more reports of strike violence than journalists can possibly cover.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some critics argue that the Enmons decision has been a major factor in increasing corruption among union and government officials alike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrtw.org/en/d/big_labor_special_privileges.htm] - National Right to Work Committee: "Top Ten Special Privelages of Organized Labor"&lt;/ref&gt; Economist and former professor Morgan Reynolds wrote:&lt;ref name="Kendrick"/&gt;{{rp|30}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is difficult to tell racketeer-controlled unions from other unions, because both types depend on violence and the threat of violence…The plain truth is that our labor laws have arranged incentives so that honest, noncoercive union officials find it difficult to survive in competition with the muscleman types.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, others argue the FUVA has greatly exaggerated the existence of union violence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In a law review article, Julius G. Getman and F. Ray Marshall, The Continuing Assault on the Right to Strike, 79 Tex. L. Rev. 703, 712-13 (2001), law professor Julius Getman and former Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall, analyzed the evidence of union violence.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The claim that strike violence is "escalating" has no empirical basis. Even the study conducted by the National Institute for Labor Relations Research - cited regularly as authority for this proposition by FUVA's proponents - draws no such conclusion. And the study itself is a scholarly monstrosity that seeks to study union violence by compiling media reports, mainly newspaper articles concerning strike violence. The Institute admits that it did not actually investigate any of the incidents reported and does not know if the reports are accurate. It concludes: "Because it relies on news accounts the Institute cannot guarantee the accuracy of the file itself." In fact, articles about employer-instigated violence are included in the study's effort to determine union violence. n59 It seems obvious that the methodology employed confuses those strikes most written about with those most violent. Further, the Institute includes incidents of "psychological violence; i.e., intimidation, coercion and verbal threats" - terms which it does not bother to define. It seems clear, however, that this definition would include nonviolent civil disobedience of the type used by the civil rights movement and increasingly by the labor movement. But whatever the definition, it is almost certain that strike-related violence has decreased since the Enmons decision because the number of strikes has declined significantly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since 1973, a number of bills have been proposed to overturn US v. Enmons.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The [[Freedom from Union Violence Act]] (FUVA) was first introduced as H.R. 1796 on June 8, 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h104-1796 H.R. 1796: Freedom from Union Violence Act], govtrack.us; accessed July 31, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been reintroduced in every Congress since.&lt;ref name=OtherLegislation&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s105-230&amp;tab=related Other Legislation with the Same Title]&lt;/ref&gt; None of these bills have made it out of committee.&lt;ref name=OtherLegislation/&gt;

In [[microeconomics]], the '''utility maximization problem''' is the problem [[consumer]]s face: "how should I spend my [[money]] in order to maximize my [[utility]]?" It is a type of [[Optimal decision|optimal decision problem]].

==Basic setup==
Suppose the consumer's [[consumption set]], or the enumeration of all possible consumption bundles that could be selected if there were no budget constraint, has ''L'' commodities and is limited to positive amounts of consumption of each commodity. Let ''x'' be the vector ''x''={''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;;''i''=1,...''L''} containing the amounts of each commodity; then

:&lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}^L_+ \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose also that the price vector (''p'') of the ''L'' commodities is positive,

:&lt;math&gt;p \in \mathbb{R}^L_+ \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

and that the consumer's income is &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;; then the set of all affordable packages, the [[budget set]], is

:&lt;math&gt;B(p, I) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^L_+ : \langle p , x \rangle \leq I\} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\langle p , x \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dot product]] of ''p'' and ''x'', or the total cost of consuming ''x'' of the products at price level ''p'':
:&lt;math&gt;\langle p , x \rangle=\sum_{i=1}^L p_i x_i .&lt;/math&gt;

The consumer would like to buy the best affordable package of commodities.

It is assumed that the consumer has an [[ordinal utility]] function, called ''u''. It is a real valued function with domain being the set of all commodity bundles, or

:&lt;math&gt;u : \mathbb{R}^L_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+ \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Then the consumer's optimal choice &lt;math&gt;x(p,I)&lt;/math&gt; is the utility maximizing bundle of all bundles in the budget set, or

:&lt;math&gt;x(p,I) = \operatorname{argmax}_{x^* \in B(p,I)} u(x^*)&lt;/math&gt;.

Finding &lt;math&gt;x(p,I)&lt;/math&gt; is the '''utility maximization problem'''.

If ''u'' is continuous and no commodities are free of charge, then &lt;math&gt;x(p,I)&lt;/math&gt; exists,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} but it is not necessarily unique.  If there is a unique maximizer for all values of the price and wealth parameters, then &lt;math&gt;x(p,I)&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[Marshallian demand function]]; otherwise, &lt;math&gt;x(p,I)&lt;/math&gt; is set-valued and it is called the [[Marshallian demand correspondence]].

== Reaction to changes in prices ==
For a given level of real wealth, only relative prices matter to consumers, not absolute prices.  If consumers reacted to changes in nominal prices and nominal wealth even if relative prices and real wealth remained unchanged, this would be an effect called [[money illusion]].  The mathematical first order conditions for a maximum of the consumer problem guarantee that the demand for each good is homogeneous of degree zero jointly in nominal prices and nominal wealth, so there is no money illusion.

== Bounded rationality ==
In practice, a consumer may not always pick an optimal package. For example, it may require too much thought.  [[Bounded rationality]] is a theory that explains this behaviour with [[satisficing]]&amp;mdash;picking packages that are suboptimal but good enough.

== Related concepts ==
The relationship between the [[utility function]] and [[Marshallian demand]] in the utility maximization problem mirrors the relationship between the [[expenditure function]] and [[Hicksian demand]] in the [[expenditure minimization problem]].

'''Vaginal trauma''' is injury to the [[vagina]]. It can happen during [[childbirth]], sexual assault, and accidental occurrences.

This injury often consists of bruising. But in some cases, severe hemorrhage can be a concern that requires immediate medical attention. In adults, the vagina is largely protected from trauma due to the protective function of the [[mons pubis]] and [[labia majora]]. This protection is lacking in girls who lack a protective fat layer to protect the vagina. Vaginal trauma can occur when something is inserted into the vagina, for example, a sharp object causing [[penetrating trauma]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffman|first1=Barbara L.|title=Williams Gynecology|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=9780071716727|edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaginal trauma can occur as a result of a painful sexual experience or sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/womens-health/in-depth/vagina/art-20046562|title=Vagina: What's normal, what's not|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-02-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaginal trauma can occur in children as a result of a straddle injury. Most of these, though distressing, are not serious injuries.

In some instances, a severe injury occurs and requires immediate medical attention. Especially if the bleeding won't stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.texaschildrens.org/blog/2012/07/vaginal-trauma-you-fell-what|title=Vaginal Trauma: You Fell On What? {{!}} Texas Children's Hospital|website=www.texaschildrens.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seattlechildrens.org/medical-conditions/symptom-index/genital-injury-female/|title=Genital Injury - Female|website=www.seattlechildrens.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaginal trauma also occurs during an episiotomy&lt;ref name="medscape.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/558117|title=Minimizing Genital Tract Trauma and Related Pain Following Spontaneous Vaginal Birth|last=|first=|date=|website=www.medscape.com|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vaginal childbirth.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms include:
[[abdominal pain]],
[[bleeding]],
[[Bruise|bruising]],
[[Syncope (medicine)|faintness]],
[[vaginal discharge]],
embedded object in the vagina,
genital pain,
swelling,
[[vomiting]],
painful urination,
inability to urinate,
presence of a [[wound]],
report of [[sexual abuse]], and
[[Hematuria|blood in the urine]].&lt;ref name="medline" /&gt; A [[hematoma]] can form after vaginal trauma.

==Cause==

=== Pregnancy related ===
During childbirth, vaginal or cervical injuries can occur and will likely require surgery to correct them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stratog.rcog.org.uk/tutorial/easi-resource/vaginal-and-cervical-trauma-5045|title=Vaginal and cervical trauma|website=stratog.rcog.org.uk|language=en-uk|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vagina is sometimes injured during the course of labor and perineal tears extend from the vagina to various points of the perineum.

=== Non pregnancy related ===
Non-obstetric causes include:
sexual assault,&lt;ref name=mci2017&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas K. |last=McInerny |date=2017 |title=Textbook of Pediatric Care - 2nd Edition |publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics |ISBN=978-1-58110-966-5}}  [http://online.statref.com/Do STAT!Ref Online Electronic Medical Library]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;sup&gt;[subscription required]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

￼￼ [[menopause]],{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}
and medication [[side effect]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Prevention==
A safe environment can be created for young children in addition to keeping [[infant and toddler safety|small objects out of reach]].&lt;ref name = medline&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000044.htm|title=Genital injury: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/getting-ready-baby/making-your-home-safe-baby|title=Making your home safe for baby {{!}} womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
Treatment begins with a thorough assessment. The presence of someone to provide support during the examination is very beneficial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such support is especially prioritized in cases of vaginal trauma due to sexual assault. A support person provides emotional support and can help minimize the risk of re-traumatization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.victimlaw.org/victimlaw/pages/victimsRight.jsp |title=VictimLaw - Victims Right |website=www.victimlaw.org|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://victimsofcrime.org/help-for-crime-victims/get-help-bulletins-for-crime-victims/what-is-a-victim-advocate- |title=What is a Victim Advocate- |website=victimsofcrime.org|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those treating victims employ sexual assault nurse/forensic examiners (SAN/FEs) with specific training to care for those who have experienced rape or sexual assault. They are able to conduct a focused medical-legal exam. If such a trained clinician is not available, the emergency department has a sexual assault protocol that has been established for treatment and the collection of evidence.&lt;ref name="mci2017"/&gt;

'''White power skinheads''' are members of a [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] and [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] offshoot of the [[skinhead]] [[subculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/hate_symbols/music.asp|title=White Power Music|accessdate=2007-10-07|last=|first=|coauthors=|year=2005|work=|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011040036/http://www.adl.org/hate_symbols/music.asp|archivedate=2007-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/06/national/main2440306.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Immigration Fueling White Supremacists | date=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/race/061388race-ra.html - New York Times - "Neo-Nazi Activity Is Arising Among U.S. Youth"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngcblog.nationalgeographic.com/ngcblog/2007/11/profile_of_the_new_american_sk.html National Geographic - "Profile of the New American Skinheads"]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them are affiliated with [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] organizations. 

In the [[United States]], the majority of white power skinhead groups are organized at either the state, county, city or neighborhood level. The [[Hammerskins|Hammerskin Nation]] (HSN) is one of the few exceptions, due to its international presence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whiteprisongangs.info/2009/05/skinheads.html Encyclopedia of Gangs 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807091349/http://www.whiteprisongangs.info/2009/05/skinheads.html |date=2009-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original skinhead subculture started in the late 1960s and had heavy [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mod (subculture)|mod]] and [[Jamaica]]n [[rude boy]] influences — including an appreciation for the [[black music]] genres [[ska]], [[soul music]] and early [[reggae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_1_38/ai_n6234788/pg_1 | work=Journal of Social History | title=Subcultures, pop music and politics: skinheads and "Nazi rock" in England and Germany | first=Timothy S. | last=Brown | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Old Skool Jim |first= |title=Trojan Skinhead Reggae Box Set liner notes |publisher=Trojan Records |date= |location=London |id=TJETD169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oi!"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reggaereggaereggae.com/Special%20Articles.htm Special Articles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217000127/http://www.reggaereggaereggae.com/Special%20Articles.htm |date=2008-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The identity of skinheads in the 1960s was neither based on [[white supremacy|white power]] nor [[neo-nazism]] or [[neo-fascism]], but some skinheads (including [[black people|black]] skinheads) had engaged in "[[Gay bashing|gay-bashing]]", "[[hippie]]-bashing" and/or "[[Paki (slur)|Paki-bashing]]" (violence against [[British Pakistanis|Pakistanis]] and other [[British Asian|Asian immigrants]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skinheadnation.co.uk/tilburyskinheads.htm Skinhead History - the Tilbury Trojan Skins&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050929223759/http://www.trojanrecords.net/articles/monty2.htm Monty Q&amp;A&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This began after [[Enoch Powell]]'s inflammatory [[Rivers of Blood speech]] in 1968, which unleashed "Paki-bashing" violence, often referred to as "skinhead [[Terrorism|terror]]" in the media, with the "Paki-bashers" often simply called "skinheads".&lt;ref name="Ashe"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ashe |first1=Stephen |last2=Virdee |first2=Satnam |last3=Brown |first3=Laurence |title=Striking back against racist violence in the East End of London, 1968–1970 |journal=[[Race &amp; Class]] |date=2016 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=34–54 |doi=10.1177/0306396816642997 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5327924/ |issn=0306-3968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original skinhead scene had mostly died out by 1972, but a late-1970s revival emerged partly as a backlash against the commercialization of [[punk rock]]. This revival coincided with the development of the [[Oi!]] [[music genre]].&lt;ref name="Oi!"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=George |title=Spirit of '69 - A Skinhead Bible |publisher=S.T.

Because of this, the mainstream media began to label the whole skinhead identity as neo-Nazi.

The racist faction of the skinhead subculture eventually spread to [[North America]], [[Europe]] and other areas of the world. White power skinhead groups such as the [[Hammerskins]] emerged, and racist skinheads gained acceptance among other organized white power organizations such as the [[Creativity Movement|Church of the Creator]], [[White Aryan Resistance]] and the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=310 |title=Southern Poverty Law Center - Hammerskin Nation |access-date=2009-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019195853/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=310 |archive-date=2009-10-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis B.

Wright and Burmeister were both arrested at a trailer park where police found a 9-mm semiautomatic pistol, a Nazi flag, white supremacist pamphlets, and other gang paraphernalia. Both men were sentenced to life in prison.

According to a 2007 report by the [[Anti-Defamation League]], groups such as white power skinheads, neo-Nazis, and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] have been growing more active in the United States, with a particular focus on [[Nativism (politics)|opposition to illegal  immigration]].&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"/&gt;

== Style and clothing ==
[[Skinhead]]s of all types are known for wearing [[Dr. Martens]] or [[Combat boot|combat-style boots]], [[flight jacket]]s, [[jeans]] and [[suspenders]] (also known as braces). Some white power skinheads wear badges, chains or rings featuring [[Nazism|Nazi]] or [[White supremacy|white power]] emblems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2007/09/21/nyt-fashion-pub-skinhead-style-is-back/ Southern Poverty Law Center - "Skinhead Style is Back"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6546617.stm BBC News - "Under the skin"]&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Punk fashion|punk]]-influenced [[Oi!]] skinheads dress similarly to white power skinheads, without the racist or neo-Nazi symbols. 

In contrast to the 1960s-style [[Mod (subculture)|mod]]-influenced [[Trojan skinhead]]s, white power skinheads have typically worn higher boots, [[T-shirt]]s, [[flight jacket]]s and army [[trousers]] or [[jeans]] instead of [[Sta-Prest]] trousers or suits. Some white power or moderately right-wing/nationalist skinheads may dress quasi-traditional with Fred Perry or button down shirts and Harrington or [[denim jacket]]s. They usually crop their hair shorter than the 1960s-style skinheads — often to [[Buzz cut|grade 0]] length — or they shave their heads completely with a [[razor]]. White power skinheads tend to have more [[tattoo]]s than the skinheads of the 1960s, many of whom had no tattoos at all. These tattoos often feature Nazi, racist, or nationalistic imagery. Rune symbols as well as Nordic, Celtic and Germanic artwork are also common themes.

In [[Germany]], [[Spain]] and the [[Netherlands]], the [[Lonsdale (brand)|Lonsdale]] clothing brand has been popular among some [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] skinheads. This was partly because the four middle letters of Lonsdale, ''NSDA'', are almost the same as the abbreviation for the name of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s political party, the [[Nazi Party|Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei]] (NSDAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article352747.ece | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Lonsdale faces ban over 'neo-Nazi associations' | first=Tony | last=Paterson | date=2006-03-22 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117155158/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article352747.ece | archivedate=2008-01-17 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lonsdale brand has been popular with non-racist skinheads for decades, and the company has sponsored [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] events and campaigns, and has refused to deliver products to known neo-Nazi retailers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=2401151 "Branded youths"].

'''Zamanfou''', also known as '''"ochaderfismos"''' (''[[Greek language|Greek]] "Ωχαδερφισμός"'') is a [[counterculture]] phenomenon in [[Greece]] which involves [[social loafing]] as its principal characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akyro.net/2007/05/03/social-loafing-%CE%AE-%CF%89%CF%87%CE%B1%CE%B4%CE%B5%CF%81%CF%86%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CF%8C%CF%82-%CE%AE-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%B9%CE%B4%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CF%8C%CF%82-%CE%AE-zamanfou/ Social loafing ή ωχαδερφισμός ή σταρχιδισμός ή… zamanfou.]. Retrieved on 2007-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term is derived from the [[French language|French]] phrase''' "je m'en fous"''' (''foutre''). The French expression ''Je m'en fous'' became known by the Greeks before [[World War II]], when the [[French language]] was the most common foreign language in [[Greece]]. It was later adopted into everyday slang vocabulary, with Greek spelling and pronunciation. It is roughly equivalent to the English 'I don't care'.

The associated term "ohaderfismos" derives from the Greek phrase "oh brother!" (ωχ αδερφέ!).

==Background==
Although Zamanfou might be considered a social phenomenon in Greece, it is no different from [[Social loafing]], as this appears in other cultures or epochs.

==Zamanfou in popular culture==
*"Zamanfou" is the title of a Greek song of Sakis Boulas.
*"Zamanfou" is the title of a Greek Hip Hop song of the rapper Eisvoleas.
*"Zamanfou" was the title of a Greek TV show by [[Annita Pania]]
*"Zamanfou" is the title of a Greek Hip Hop song of the rapper [[Taraxias]] featuring [[Sakis Boulas]] &amp; Vasia Patrikarea (new version of the Sakis Boulas' song).
