The {{nihongo|'''''Buke shohatto'''''|武家諸法度|lit. Various Points of Laws for Warrior Houses}}, commonly known in English as the '''Laws for the Military Houses''', was a collection of edicts issued by Japan's [[Tokugawa shogunate]] governing the responsibilities and activities of ''[[daimyō]]'' (feudal lords) and the rest of the [[samurai]] warrior aristocracy. These formed the basis of the ''[[bakuhan taisei]]'' (shogunate-domains system) which lay at the foundation of the Tokugawa regime. The contents of the edicts were seen as a code of conduct, a description of proper honorable ''daimyō'' behavior, and not solely laws which had to be obeyed. By appealing to notions of morality and honor, therefore, the shogunate was able to see its strictures followed despite its inability to enforce them directly.

The edicts were first read to a gathering of ''daimyō'' by the retired ''[[shōgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], at [[Fushimi Castle]] in the seventh [[lunar calendar|lunar month]] of 1615. They had been compiled by a number of scholars in service to the shogunate including [[Ishin Sūden]], and were aimed primarily at limiting the power of the ''daimyō'' and thus protecting the shogunate's control over the country.

The reigning ''shōgun'' at the time, Ieyasu's son [[Tokugawa Hidetada]], formally promulgated the edicts shortly afterwards, and each successive shogun formally reissued them, reinforcing the restrictions on the ''daimyō'' and the control of the shogunate. Through these successive generations, however, the rules developed and changed significantly.

==Articles promulgated in 1615==
# The samurai class should devote itself to pursuits appropriate to the warrior aristocracy, such as archery, swordsmanship, horsemanship, and classical literature.
# Amusements and entertainments are to be kept within reasonable bounds and expenses for such activities are not to be excessive.
# The ''[[han (country subdivision)|han]]'' (feudal domains) are not to harbor fugitives and outlaws.
# Domains must expel rebels and murderers from their service and from their lands.
# ''Daimyō'' are not to engage in social interactions with the people (neither samurai nor commoners) of other domains.
# Castles may be repaired, but such activity must be reported to the shogunate. Structural innovations and expansions are forbidden.
# The formation of cliques for scheming or conspiracy in neighboring domains must be reported to the shogunate without delay, as must the expansion of defenses, fortifications, or military forces.
# Marriages among ''daimyō'' and related persons of power or importance must not be arranged privately.
# ''Daimyō'' must present themselves at [[Edo]] for service to the shogunate.
# Conventions regarding formal uniform must be followed.
# Miscellaneous persons are not to ride in [[palanquin]]s.
# Samurai throughout the realm are to practice frugality.
# ''Daimyō'' must select men of ability to serve as administrators and bureaucrats.

The 1615 edict contains the core of the shogunate's philosophy regarding samurai codes of conduct. Similar policies would be imposed upon commoners as well, reissued and reinforced many times over the course of the Edo period.

Several items concern the need for frugality, a concept central to [[Confucianism|Confucian]] notions of proper governance. Others relate to [[sumptuary law]], requiring people of certain stations to present themselves as such, in their dress, their modes of transportation, and in other ways.

Some items were included to prevent the formation of alliances against the shogunate, for example, the items regarding social interactions between domains and marriages among the ''daimyō'' families. The ''[[fudai]] daimyō'' bore less power, were more trusted by the shogunate, and could be easily punished by having their domains and privileges rescinded. However, the ''[[tozama]] daimyō'' were far more powerful and less trusted and the shogunate lacked the strength to directly impose by force its policies within the ''tozama'' domains and rightfully feared the military potential of an alliance between multiple ''tozama'' domains.

Regulations regarding the construction, expansion, and repair of fortifications also serve to prevent the build-up of military power that could be used against the shogunate, as does a reference to the policy of ''[[sankin-kōtai]]'', by which ''daimyō'' were required to make elaborate pilgrimages to Edo regularly, to present themselves for service.

==Promulgated in 1635==
The edicts were reissued in 1629, and again in 1635, by the third Tokugawa shogun, [[Tokugawa Iemitsu|Iemitsu]]. Though there were many changes in this third promulgation, most of the stipulations were simply elaborations on the same themes. ''Daimyō'' were banned from quarreling, from forming alliances and parties, and from swearing oaths to one another. The system of ''sankin kōtai'' was more fully established at this time, and described more specifically in the edict. Sumptuary regulations were elaborated upon.

This year is also quite significant for the implementation of a number of policies which can be grouped under the term ''[[kaikin]]'' (maritime prohibitions), and which are sometimes referred to as the [[Sakoku Edict of 1635|Sakoku Edicts]]. Though the restrictions against overseas travel are not themselves mentioned in the 1635 version of the ''buke shohatto'', a number of related policies regarding domestic travel and religion are described.

Some of the new stipulations were as follows:
#Care must be taken to maintain roads, boats, bridges, and docks in order to facilitate swift communications.
#Private toll barriers are forbidden, as is the elimination of existing ferry routes.
#Ships which can carry over 500 ''[[koku]]'' are forbidden to be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1991), pp. 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;
#Lands owned by [[Shinto shrine]]s and [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temples]] must not be taken away from them.
#Christianity is forbidden.

==Later promulgations==
The edicts were reissued upon the succession of each of the ''shōguns''. The promulgations under [[Tokugawa Ietsuna]], [[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]], and [[Tokugawa Ienobu]] in 1663, 1683, and 1710 respectively saw significant stylistic changes, though with relatively minor amendments of substance. Among the new stipulations were bans on ''[[junshi]]'' (ritual suicide following the death of one's lord), abuses of power, the acceptance of bribes, and the suppression of popular opinion, along with stipulations regarding the proper succession of ''daimyōs'' within a clan or domain.

The following seven ''shōguns'' reissued the ''buke shohatto'' in its 1683 form, with only the most minor of stylistic changes. Though these were once pronounced along with the ''[[Shoshi hatto]]'' (laws for samurai), the latter became largely obsolete after 1683 and was absorbed into the wider body of shogunal orders and prohibitions (the ''[[kinrei-ko]]'').

{{Chinese folk religion}}
'''Chinese spiritual world concepts''' are cultural practices or methods found in [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]].  Some fit in the realms of a particular religion, others do not.  In general these concepts were uniquely evolved from the Chinese values of filial piety, tacit acknowledgment of the co-existence of the living and the deceased, and the belief in causality and reincarnation, with or without religious overtones.

== Practices and beliefs ==

* '''[[Ancestral worship]]''' (拜祖) – A practice to honor the deeds and memories of the deceased.  This is an extension to the [[filial piety]] from the teachings of [[Confucius]] and [[Laozi]]. Elders, seniors, extended families and particularly parents are to be respected, heeded and looked after. Respects continue after their deaths.  In addition to the [[Qingming]] and [[Chongyang Festival|Chongyang]] festivals, descendants should pay tribute to ancestors during the ''Zhongyuanjie'', more commonly known as the [[Ghost Festival]] ( but ghost festival is on Dongzhi "冬至”） In addition to providing a tombstone or urn cover, descendants are traditionally expected to install an altar (神台) in their home to pay homage regularly each day with [[joss sticks]] and tea. The ancestors, including parents and grandparents, are worshipped or venerated as if they are still living.
* '''Three [[Realms]]''' (三曹) – the belief that Heaven, the living and the deceased exist side by side; [[heaven]] a place for [[saint]]s or rested [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s, [[diyu|hell]] for the criminous deceased. '''[[Hun and po|Three wun seven pak]]''' (三魂七魄) explains a person's existence.  The three realms is where a person exists, and the seven states are what makes a person exist.  The [[Pumi people]], for example, are a supporter of this concept.&lt;ref&gt;China.com.cn. "[http://www.china.com.cn/culture/aboutchina/pmz/2009-08/04/content_18264553.htm China.com.cn]." ''三魂七魄 普米族喊魂的习俗.'' Retrieved on 2010-07-24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Jian''' (間) – The living world where people exist in reality is referred to as Yang Jian (陽間). The [[underworld]] where spirits exist after death is regarded as Yin Jian (陰間), though this is not necessarily a negative place such as [[diyu|hell]].
* '''[[Tai Sui|Fan Tai Sui]]''' (犯太歲) – is when an individual faces major obstacles in health, job and studies.&lt;ref name="hkstan1"&gt;HKstandard. "[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=21&amp;art_id=65923&amp;sid=18957281&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20080516&amp;sear_year=2008 HKstandard]." ''Rats to lucky number eight.'' Retrieved on 2008-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  The obstacles last for a single [[Chinese calendar]] year. An example is when Hong Kong [[Feng shui]] master Raymond Lo tried to explain the occurrences in 2008 in relation to [[People's Republic of China]] leaders [[Hu Jintao]] and [[Wen Jiabao]]. Within the animal astrology the [[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]] clashes with the [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]], causing a turbulent year.&lt;ref name="ihthorse"&gt;IHT. "[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/05/15/asia/AS-GEN-OLY-China-Feng-Shui.php International Herald Tribune]." ''Feng Shui master explains bad to start to 2008 Olympic year.'' Retrieved on 2008-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Hu and Wen are born in 1942, the [[Horse (zodiac)|year of the Horse]], which clashes with 2008 the [[Rat (zodiac)|year of the Rat]]. Hence [[2008 in the People's Republic of China|2008 in China]] was one of the most turbulent year with [[2008 Tibetan unrest|Tibetan unrest]], [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|Sichuan earthquake]] and many more events.&lt;ref name="hkstan1" /&gt;  Another example is [[Henry Tang]] suffering from Fan Tai shui in 2012 where he experienced the [[Henry Tang illegal basement controversy|illegal basement controversy]] as well as many other events during the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2012|2012 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orientaldaily.on.cc/cnt/news/20120216/00174_001.html |script-title=zh:唐宮曝光 英名掃地 年犯太歲 議員：退選吧﹗ – 東方日報 |language=zh |publisher=Orientaldaily.on.cc |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tang would end up losing the election.
* '''Zung saang gei''' (種生基) – is when a piece of hair is placed in a particular [[fung shui]] location in an attempt to extend a person's life.  A publicised example is Hong Kong actress [[Tina Leung]] who performed this practice in 1998 at a place near the Xingdao Lake (星島湖) in [[Beihai]], [[Guangxi]], China.  The maximum that she could extend was 12 years. She died exactly 12 years later in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Eastweek. 2010 April 11 volume 326. pg 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sina.com. "[http://dailynews.sina.com/bg/ent/chinapress/20100407/23471328266.html Sina.com]." ''狄娜愛兒否認請人種生基.'' Retrieved on 2010-07-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modes of communication==
*'''[[Fuji (planchette writing)|Fuji]]''' (乩文) – planchette writing is practiced using either a rattan sieve (see [[coscinomancy]]) or a wooden stylus to write [[Chinese characters]] in sand or incense ashes. This Chinese tradition of [[automatic writing]] continues to be practiced in [[Taoist]] temples in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China.
* '''Mun mai''' ([[:zh:問覡|問米]]) – is communication directly with [[spirit]]s who have died.  The most common usage is for finding and contacting deceased relatives or loved ones. The general cultural term is that people are raised from the underground or down from heaven to communicate. A western comparison is likely [[seance]] or [[necromancy]].
* '''Yum si lou''' (陰司路) – is the idea of flooding the spiritual road with [[Hell bank note|spiritual money]] to ensure the person who died will reach their destination safely.  In Chinese culture, the road to [[heaven]], [[diyu]] or [[reincarnation]] may not be clear.  By overloading the path with spiritual money, hopefully all troubled souls on the way will be too occupied with the money and leave the traveling-soul alone.  This is an assurance for the living.
* '''[[Villain hitting]]''' (打小人) – is a folk [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] popular in the [[Guangdong]] area of [[China]] and [[Hong Kong]] used for exorcising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myheartmyhome.hk/eng/sight_02.php?id=2&amp;locationid=1 "Demon-exorcising Service at 'Goose-neck Bridge' "]. My Heart, My Home – 18 Districts Reach Out Together for Lovable Sights in Hong Kong. Retrieved 11 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tong ling''' (通靈) – is to tunnel and channel through to communicate with spirits.

==Figures==
* '''Gui ren''' (貴人) – Someone who can help you.  Or is destined to help you.
* '''Xiao ren''' (小人) ("Siu yen" in Cantonese) – Someone who can hurt you.  Or is destined to hurt you.  Simple methods such as [[kau cim]] can usually inform you whether a guiren or xiaoren is visible in your near future.

==Objects==
* '''Peach wood sword''' (桃木劍) – the definitive weapon used for demon exorcism during [[Taoist]] exorcism.&lt;ref name="JLAS"&gt;Lee, James. [2006] (2006). James Lee Astrology guide 2006 English edition.

* '''[[Shigandang|Stone tablets]]''' (石敢當) – the tablets are placed at main doors, junctions of small avenues, three-way junctions, river banks or ponds to gather positive energy and ward off evil spirit.  Sometimes it is used to block natural mishaps such as [[natural disasters]].&lt;ref name="JLAS" /&gt;
* '''Tai mountain stone tablets''' (泰山石敢當) – the most powerful of the stone tablets are made from stones coming from [[Mount Tai]].  These stone tablets are shaped like the mountain forming the 5 fingers shape.&lt;ref name="JLAS" /&gt;  The ones inscribed with (泰山石敢當) go with along with [[Battle of Zhuolu|the legend of the fight]] between war deity [[Chi You]] and the [[Yellow Emperor]].&lt;ref name="JLAS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;石敢當.

[[Image:Lord Warden Cinque Ports (Lord Boyce).svg|thumb|right|border|Flag of the [[Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports]], a heraldic emblem which displays conflated or "con-joined" images.&lt;!-- three ships' hulls and three Lions passant guardant conjoined to these hulls, all in gold. They may originally have been ''Gules three lions passant gardant in pale Or'' (for England) dimidiating ''Gules three ships' hulks in pale Or''--&gt;]]

'''Conflation''' is the merging of two or more sets of information, texts, ideas, opinions, etc into one, often in error.&lt;ref&gt;Haught, John F. (1995). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1Y9JMBqvGlMC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=conflation&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a ''Science and Religion: From Conflict to Conversation''], p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[logic]], it is the practice of treating two distinct [[concept]]s as if they were one, which produces errors or misunderstandings as a fusion of distinct subjects tends to obscure analysis of relationships which are emphasized by contrasts.&lt;ref&gt;Haught, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1Y9JMBqvGlMC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=conflation&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA14,M1 ''Science and Religion: From Conflict to Conversation''], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the distinctions between the two concepts appear to be superficial, intentional conflation may be desirable for the sake of conciseness and recall.

The result of conflating concepts may give rise to [[fallacies]] of [[ambiguity]], including the [[fallacy of four terms]] in a categorical [[syllogism]]. For example, the word "bat" has at least two distinct meanings: a flying animal, and a piece of sporting equipment (such as a [[baseball]] bat or [[cricket]] bat). If these meanings are not distinguished, the result may be the following categorical [[syllogism]], which may be seen as a joke ([[pun]]):

:#All bats are animals.
:#Some wooden objects are bats.
:#Therefore, some wooden objects are animals.

===Logical conflation===
Using words with different meanings can help clarify, or can cause real confusion. English words with multiple (verb) meanings can be illustrated by instances in which a motion is merged with or a causation with manner,&lt;ref&gt;Mateu, Jaume and Gemma Eigeu. (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wpw1uzoG5ysC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=conflation&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA212,M1 "A Minimalist Account of Conflation Processes," in ''Theoretical Approaches to Universals,'' pp. 211–212.]&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. ''the bride floated towards her future.'' In this example, the bride may:  be married on a boat, airplane, or hot-air balloon, etc. —not all marriages occur in a church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Float|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/float|website=dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=25 September 2015|location=Verb, item 3|quote=to rest or move in a liquid, the air, etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She could be gracefully walking the aisle towards matrimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Float|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/float|website=dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=25 September 2015|location=Verb, item 4|quote=to move lightly and gracefully}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verb "float" has multiple meanings, and both verb meanings in the example may be proper uses of a bride "floating" toward a future.  The "manner" of the scene, described by further context, would explain the true meaning of the sentence.

In an alternate illustrative example, ''respect'' is used both in the sense of "recognise a right" and "have high regard for". We can ''recognise someone's right'' to the opinion the United Nations is secretly controlled by alien lizards on the moon, without ''holding this idea in high regard''. But conflation of these two different concepts leads to the notion that all ideological ideas should be treated with respect, rather than just the right to hold these ideas. Conflation in logical terms is very similar to, if not identical to, [[equivocation]].

Deliberate ''[[idiom]] conflation'' is the amalgamation of two different [[Expression (language)|expressions]]. In most cases, the combination results in a new expression that makes little sense literally, but clearly expresses an idea because it references well-known idioms.

==Types==
All conflations fit into one of two major categories: "congruent" conflations and "incongruent" conflations.

===Congruent conflations===
Congruent conflations are the more ideal, and more sought-after, examples of the concept. These occur when the two root expressions reflect similar thoughts. For example, "look who's calling the kettle black" can be formed using the root expressions "look who's talking" and "[[pot calling the kettle black|the pot calling the kettle black]]". These root expressions really mean the same thing: they are both a friendly way to point out hypocritical behavior. Of course, "look who's calling the kettle black" does not directly imply anything, yet the implication is understood because the conflation clearly refers to two known idioms.

An illustrative conflation brings together two Roman Catholic saints named Lazarus.  One, a lame beggar covered with sores which dogs are licking, appears in the New Testament (Luke 16:19–31).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk016.htm#19 Luke 16:19–31] in Roman Catholic ''New Advent Bible''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The other, Lazarus of Bethany, is identified as the man whom Jesus raised from the dead (John 11:41–44).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/bible/joh011.htm#41 John 11:41–44] in Roman Catholic ''New Advent Bible''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The beggar's Feast Day is June 21, and Lazarus of Bethany's day is December 17.&lt;ref name="SACKCLOTH"&gt;[http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y98/dec98/17e2.htm ''With sackcloth and rum, Cubans hail Saint Lazarus''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420195906/http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y98/dec98/17e2.htm |date=2008-04-20 }}, December 17, 1998. Reuters news story.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, both saints are depicted with crutches; and the blessing of dogs, associated with the beggar saint, usually takes place on December 17, the date associated with the resurrected Lazarus.  The two characters' identities have become conflated in most cultural contexts, including the [[iconography]] of both saints.&lt;ref name="FOLK"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2386/is_3_116/ai_n15950723/pg_7 ''Money talks: folklore in the public sphere''] December 2005, ''Folklore'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incongruent conflations===
Incongruent conflation occurs when the root expressions do not mean the same thing, but share a common word or theme. For example, "a bull in a candy store" can be formed from the root expressions "a bull in a china shop" and "a kid in a candy store". The latter expression paints a picture of someone ("a kid") who is extraordinarily happy and excited, whereas the former brings to mind the image of a person ("a bull") who is extremely clumsy, indelicate, not suited to a certain environment, prone to act recklessly, or easily provoked. The conflation expresses both of these ideas at the same time. Without context, the speaker's intention is not entirely clear.

An illustrative conflation seems to merge disparate figures as in [[Santería]]. St. Lazarus is conflated with the [[Orisha|Yoruba deity]] [[Babalu Aye]], and celebrated on December 17,&lt;REF NAME="SACKCLOTH"/&gt; despite Santería's reliance on the iconography associated with the begging saint whose Feast Day is June 21.&lt;ref name="FOLK"/&gt;  By blending the identity of the two conflated St. Lazarus individuals with the identity of the Babalu Aye, Santería has gone one step further than the conflation within Catholicism, to become the kind of religious conflation known as ''[[syncretism]]'', in which deities or concepts from two different faiths are conflated to form a third.

===Humorous conflations===
Idiom conflation has been used as a source of humor in certain situations. For example, the Mexican character [[El Chapulín Colorado]] once said
:"''Mas vale pájaro en mano que dios lo ayudará...no, no...Dios ayuda al que vuela como pájaro...no... bueno, la idea es esa.''"
meaning
:"A bird in the hand will get the worm...no, wait...The early bird is worth two in the bush...no... well, that's the idea."
by combining two popular expressions:
*"''Más vale pájaro en mano que cientos volando''" ("A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.")
*"''Al que madruga Dios lo ayuda''" ("The early bird gets the worm.")
This was typical of the character, and he did it with several other expressions over the course of his comedy routine. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In popular culture, identities are sometimes intentionally conflated.  In the early 2000s, the popular American actors [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]] were dating, and the [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] press referred to them playfully as a third entity, [[Bennifer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Sigman | first = Michael | title = Inflation May Be Under Control, But Watch Out for Conflation | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-sigman/inflation-may-be-under-co_b_712483.html | publisher =  | date =  September 10, 2010 | accessdate = 25 April 2011 | work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomic conflation==
In taxonomies, a conflative term is always a [[polyseme]].&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Joseph L. (1988). [https://books.google.com/books?id=PEY0U3umLRkC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=conflation&amp;client=firefox-a  ''The Science of Linguistics in the Art of Translation: Some Tools from Linguistics for the Analysis and Practice of Translation,'' p. 112.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ekāgratā''' ([[Sanskrit]]: एकाग्रता, "one-pointedness") is intent pursuit of one object, close and undisturbed  attention. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+ekagrata&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoga]] emphasises regular practice (''[[Abhyasa]]'') [[meditation]] and self-imposed discipline to acquire ekagrata.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

==Overview==

The faculty called Ekāgratā may be increased by integrating the psycho-mental flux (''sarvārthatā'' or variously-directed, discontinuous, and diffuse attention) so that one gains genuine will&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Medicine Men to Muhammad|author=Mercia Eliade|publisher=Harper and Row|page=73|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sY0uH75vwW8C&amp;q=ekagrata&amp;dq=ekagrata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tcT5UvCwIo-ThQfksIGQDw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBzgU}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a happiness different from the experience of pleasure from sense-objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sivananda companion to Meditation|publisher= Sivananda Yoga Center|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ImI9p7msCQC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=ekagrata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bsH5UoPyEtOFhQfvr4DIAw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ekagrata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is harder to achieve if the body is in a tiring or uncomfortable posture or if the breathing is improper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Suggestopedia and Language|author=W.Jane Boncroft|publisher=Routledge|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXiNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT136&amp;dq=ekagrata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hsP5UuXDEYishQensoDABw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=ekagrata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austerity (''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]]'') is allied to this conception of ''ekagrata''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=146|url=  http://www.worldcat.org/title/illumination-of-knowledge-a-brief-reflection-on-the-role-of-agni-the-vedic-god-of-fire/oclc/470877223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Badarayana]]'s [[Brahma Sutras]] (chapter 3) uses the term to mean [[dharana|concentration]]: it is held to be a quality resulting from practices discussed in the previous chapter,which are briefly mentioned in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] and [[Chandogya Upanishad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya|author=Sankaracarya|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=812-833|url=  http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/brahma-sutra-bhasya-of-shankaracharya-IDJ504/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to the [[Bhagavad Gita]] the seeker after Truth should meditate with his mind fixed on the Lord (''machchittāh'') and absorbed in Him (''matparāh''). This is ''ekagrata''. The term ''nityayuktāh'' refers to devotees who keep their mind fixed on God uninterruptedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimadbhagavadagita Tattvavivecani|author= Jayadayal Goyandaka|publisher=Gita Press, Gorakhpur|page=400|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patanjali]] highlights the importance of continuous practice of prescribed methods to gain ekagrata, the state of the meditative mind free of diverted attention etc.; and thereafter explains that:-

:ततः पुनःशान्तोदितौ तुल्यप्रत्ययौ चित्तस्यैकाग्रतापरिणामः | - Yoga Sutra III.12

intentness on a single point (ekagrata) of the thinking principle (''[[citta]]'') gives rise to equilibrium of placid states (previously accumulated impressions) and aroused states (present eagerness to gain more knowledge), which are modifications (of the mind). These two states of mind remain unchanged and are brought to the state of stillness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: A Scientific Exposition |author=Vinod Verma|publisher=Clarion Books|page=116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lax-nToYgt8C&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=ekagrata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bsH5UoPyEtOFhQfvr4DIAw&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=ekagrata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ekagrata'' and ''[[Dhāraṇā|dharana]]'' do not differ from each other, or else ''dharana'' is achieving and maintaining ''ekagrata''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Classical Yoga|author=Georg Feuerstein|publisher=Inner Traditions|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuWI9M9WC6MC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=ekagrata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bsH5UoPyEtOFhQfvr4DIAw&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=ekagrata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dharana'' converges on a particular concept or object. In the state of ''ekagrata'' there is clarity and right direction: yoga begins with ekagrata and culminates in ''nirodha'', a consciousness free of movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religiousness in Yoga|author=T.K.V.Desikachar|publisher=University Press of America|page=228,251|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZxCpDG7Mp4C&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=ekagrata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bsH5UoPyEtOFhQfvr4DIAw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ekagrata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dharana'' gives the ability to see one’s own mind, one starts looking inwards deeply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga: ANatural Way of Being|author=Vinod Verma|publisher=Gayatri Books|page=120, |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WscRyyoLyMIC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=ekagrata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hsP5UuXDEYishQensoDABw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=ekagrata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''ekagrata'' is lost the full power of intention to achieve goals to be achieved is lost. Intentions afflicted by doubts, fears and reactive thoughts break and diffuse the energy of intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Secret Spiritual World of Children|author=Tobin Hart|publisher=New World Library|page=195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5z87fHw60PMC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=ekagrata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tcT5UvCwIo-ThQfksIGQDw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=ekagrata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mind which is the cause of ''[[Sankalpa (Hindu thought)|Sankalpa]]'' ('notion')-''Vikalpa'' ('alternative') must be controlled, it must be bound. Ekagrata assists in keeping one’s own mind bound and still.

'''Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia''', also '''Helen Cornaro''' ({{IPA-it|pisˈkɔːpja|lang}}; 5 June 1646 – 26 July 1684), was a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[philosopher]] of noble descent, who was one of the first women to receive an academic degree from a university&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul F. Grendler|title=Schools, Seminaries, and Catechetical Instruction, in Catholicism in Early Modern History 1500-1700: A Guide to Research|editor=John W. O'Malley|publisher=Center for Information Research|year=1988|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1678 she became the first woman in the world to receive a [[Ph.D.]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/piscopia.htm |title=Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia |publisher=Agnesscott.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Elena Cornaro Piscopia was born in the [[Palazzo Loredan]], at [[Venice]], [[Republic of Venice]] on 5 June 1646. She was the third child of Gianbattista Cornaro-Piscopia, and his mistress Zanetta Boni. Her mother was a peasant and her parents were not married at the time of her birth.&lt;ref name="lc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gregersen|first=Erik|title=Elena Cornaro|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1759989/Elena-Cornaro|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Lady Elena was not technically a member of the Cornaro family by birth, as Venetian law barred illegitimate children of nobles from noble privilege, even if recognized by the noble parent. Worse for Zanetta's case, she was from an extremely poor peasant family. Zanetta had likely fled to Venice in order to escape starvation, and soon found herself the mistress of a member of one of the most powerful noble dynasties in the Republic. Gianbattista and Zanetta married officially in 1654, but his sons were barred from noble privilege, which galled Gianbattista.

In 1664, her father was chosen to become the [[Procurator of St Mark's|''Procuratore di San Marco de supra'']], the treasurer of St. Mark's, a coveted position among Venetian nobility. At that point, her father was second only to the [[Doge of Venice]] in terms of precedence.&lt;ref name="lc1"&gt;Guernsey, Jane (1991), Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this connection, Lady Elena was prominent in the Marriage of the Sea celebration, even though she was born illegitimate. Her father tried to arrange betrothals for her several times. She rebuffed each man's advances, as she had taken a vow of chastity at the age of eleven.&lt;ref name="lc" /&gt;

In 1665 she took the habit of a [[Benedictine]] Oblate without, however, becoming a [[nun]].&lt;ref name="lc" /&gt;

==Education==
As a young girl, Lady Elena was seen as a prodigy. By the advice from Giovanni Fabris, a priest who was a friend of the family, she began a classical education. She studied [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] under distinguished instructors, and soon became proficient in these languages at the age of seven, including French and Spanish.&lt;ref name="lc" /&gt; She also mastered [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], earning the title of "Oraculum Septilingue". Her later studies included [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], and [[theology]]. 

Elena came to be an expert musician. In addition to mastering the sciblis of her time—which means she mastered almost the entire body of knowledge—Elena mastered the [[harpsichord]], the [[clavichord]], the harp, and the violin. Her skills were shown by the music that she composed in her lifetime.

In her late teens and early twenties, she became interested in [[physics]], [[astronomy]], and [[linguistics]]. [[Carlo Rinaldini]], her tutor in philosophy, and at that point the Chairman of Philosophy at the [[University of Padua]], published a book in Latin centering on geometry. The book was dedicated to a twenty-two year old Elena in 1668. When her main tutor, Fabris, passed away, she became even closer to Rinaldini, who took over her studies.&lt;ref name="lc" /&gt; 

==Career==
In 1669, she translated the ''Colloquy of Christ'' by Carthusian monk [[Giovanni Lanspergio]] from Spanish into Italian. The translation was dedicated to her close friend and confessor, Fr. Gianpaolo Oliva. The volume was issued in five editions in the Republic from 1669 to 1672. She was invited to be a part of many scholarly societies when her fame spread and in 1670 became president of the Venetian society Accademia dei Pacifici.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K1Mpcym35CwC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=Elena+Cornaro+Piscopia+pacifici&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiyqaThx9vTAhUG6oMKHZKACqcQ6AEIKjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Elena%20Cornaro%20Piscopia%20pacifici&amp;f=false|title=Delle accademie veneziane dissertazione storica di Michele Battagia|last=Battagia|first=Michele|date=1826|publisher=dalla tipografia di Giuseppe Picotti|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guernsey8"&gt;Guernsey, Ch. 8 (pg. 101)&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the recommendation of Carlo Rinaldini, her tutor in philosophy, Felice Rotondi, petitioned the [[University of Padua]] to grant Cornaro the ''[[Laurea#Former status of the Laurea degree|laurea]]'' in theology.&lt;ref name=unipd&gt;{{cite web|title=Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia|url=http://www.unipd.it/elena-lucrezia-cornaro-piscopia|publisher=Università degli studi di Padova|accessdate=22 January 2016|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Gregorio Cardinal Barbarigo, the bishop of Padua, learned that she was pursuing a degree in theology, he refused on the grounds that she was a woman.&lt;ref name=unipd/&gt; However, he did allow for her to get a degree in philosophy and after a brilliant course of study received the ''laurea'' in Philosophy.&lt;ref name=unipd/&gt; The degree was conferred on 25 June 1678, in Padua Cathedral in the presence of the University authorities, the professors of all the faculties, the students, and most of the Venetian Senators, together with many invited guests from the Universities of Bologna, Perugia, Rome, and Naples. The Lady Elena spoke for an hour in classical Latin, explaining difficult passages selected at random from the works of Aristotle. She was listened to with great attention, and when she had finished, she received plaudits as Professor Rinaldini proceeded to award her the insignia of the laurea, the book of philosophy, placing the wreath of laurel on her head, the ring on her finger, and over her shoulders the ermine mozetta. This scene is illustrated in the Cornaro Window in the West Wing of the [[Thompson Memorial Library]] at [[Vassar College]].

The last seven years of her life were devoted to study and charity. She died at [[Padua]] in 1684 of tuberculosis, was buried in the [[Abbey of Santa Giustina|church of Santa Giustina]] at Padua, and her statue was placed in the university.

==Legacy==
{{unreferenced|section|date=June 2017}}
Her death was marked by memorial services in Venice, Padua, Siena, and Rome. Her writings, published at [[Parma]] in 1688, include academic discourses, translations, and devotional treatises. In 1685 the University of Padua caused a medal to be struck in her honour. In 1895 Abbess Mathilda Pynsent of the English Benedictine Nuns in [[Rome]] had Elena's tomb opened, the remains placed in a new casket, and a suitable tablet inscribed to her memory.

The book by Jane Smith Guernsey, entitled ''The Lady Cornaro: Pride and Prodigy of Venice'', published in 1999, is the first full-length study of the life of Lady Elena.

Fascists saw [[World War I]] as a [[revolution]] that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state and technology. The advent of [[total war]] and the total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilians and combatants. A "military citizenship" arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner during the war.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mann65"&gt;Michael Mann. ''Fascists''. Cambridge University Press, 2004. p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The war had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines and providing economic production and logistics to support them, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mann65"/&gt;

Fascists believe that [[liberal democracy]] is obsolete and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[one-party state]] as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;John Horne. ''State, Society and Mobilization in Europe During the First World War''. pp. 237–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a state is led by a strong leader—such as a [[Dictatorship|dictator]] and a [[Militarism|martial]] government composed of the members of the governing fascist party—to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature and views political violence, war and [[imperialism]] as means that can achieve national rejuvenation.&lt;ref name="gj120"/&gt;&lt;ref name="routledge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1945. p. 106"&gt;Stanley G. Payne. A History of Fascism, 1914–1945. p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson J. Spielvogel. ''Western Civilization''. Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, 2012. p. 935.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascists advocate a [[mixed economy]], with the principal goal of achieving [[autarky]] (national economic self-sufficiency) through [[Protectionism|protectionist]] and interventionist economic policies.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 188-189"/&gt;

Since the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, few parties have openly described themselves as fascist and the term is instead now usually used [[Fascist (insult)|pejoratively]] by political opponents. The descriptions [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] or post-fascist are sometimes applied more formally to describe parties of the far-right with ideologies similar to, or rooted in, 20th-century fascist movements.&lt;ref name="RoutledgeCompanion"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/neofascismo/|title=Neofascismo|publisher=Enciclopedia Italiana|language=Italian|date=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Revolution sidebar}}
The Italian term ''fascismo'' is derived from ''fascio'' meaning a bundle of rods, ultimately from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''[[fasces]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism|title=Definition of FASCISM|publisher=''[[Merriam-Webster]]''|date=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the name given to political organizations in Italy known as [[fasci]], groups similar to [[guild]]s or [[syndicate]]s. According to [[Mussolini]]'s own account, the [[Fascist Revolutionary Party]] (''Partito Fascista Rivoluzionario'' or PFR) was founded in Italy in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Benito Mussolini (2006), ''My Autobiography with The Political and Social Doctrine of Fascism'', Mineloa: NY: Dover Publication Inc., p. 227. Note that some authors refer to Mussolini's first political party as "The Revolutionary Fascist Party".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, Mussolini founded the [[Fasci Italiani di Combattimento]] in Milan, which became the ''Partito Nazionale Fascista'' ([[National Fascist Party]]) two years later. The Fascists came to associate the term with the ancient Roman fasces or ''[[fascio littorio]]''&lt;ref&gt;Falasca-Zamponi, Simonetta, ''Fascist Spectacle: The Aesthetics of Power in Mussolini's Italy'' University of California Press (2000), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;—a bundle of rods tied around an axe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okwu.edu/keating-center/2013/04/the-rule-of-law-symbols-of-power/|title=The Rule of Law: Symbols of Power|last=Johnston|first=Peter|work=The Keating Center|publisher=[[Oklahoma Wesleyan University]]|date=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] symbol of the authority of the civic [[Roman Magistrates|magistrate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intraweb.stockton.edu/eyos/page.cfm?siteID=78&amp;pageID=35|title=Policing Rome: Maintaining Order in Fact and Fiction|last=Watkins|first=Tom|work=Fictional Rome|publisher =Richard Stockton College of New Jersey|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; carried by his [[lictor]]s, which could be used for [[Corporal punishment|corporal]] and [[capital punishment]] at his command.&lt;ref name="Webster's II New College Dictionary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="paynee"/&gt;

The symbolism of the fasces suggested strength through unity: a single rod is easily broken, while the bundle is difficult to break.&lt;ref name="In the Shadow of the Fasces: Political Design in Fascist Italy"/&gt; Similar symbols were developed by different fascist movements: for example, the [[Falange]] symbol is five arrows joined together by a yoke.&lt;ref name="Fashioning the Body Politic: Dress, Gender, Citizenship"/&gt;

==Definitions==
{{Main|Definitions of fascism}}
Historians, political scientists and other scholars have long debated the exact nature of fascism.&lt;ref name="phoenix" /&gt; Each group described as fascist has at least some unique elements, and many definitions of fascism have been criticized as either too wide or narrow.&lt;ref name="deff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="intelligentguide"/&gt;

One common definition of the term focuses on three concepts:

# the fascist negations ([[anti-liberalism]], [[anti-communism]] and anti-[[conservatism]]); 
# nationalist authoritarian goals of creating a regulated economic structure to transform social relations within a modern, self-determined culture; and 
# a political aesthetic of romantic symbolism, mass mobilization, a positive view of violence and promotion of masculinity, youth and charismatic leadership.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aristotle4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="practice"/&gt;

According to many scholars, fascism—especially once in power—has historically attacked communism, conservatism and parliamentary liberalism, attracting support primarily from the far-right.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueuer, 1996 p. 223; Eatwell, Fascism: A History. 1996, p. 39; Griffin, 1991, 2000, pp. 185–201; Weber, [1964] 1982, p. 8; Payne (1995), Fritzsche (1990), Laclau (1977), and Reich (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Griffin]] describes fascism as "a genus of political ideology whose mythic core in its various permutations is a [[palingenesis|palingenetic]] form of [[populism|populist]] [[ultranationalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Roger, ''The Nature of Fascism'' (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1991), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin describes the ideology as having three core components: "(i) the rebirth myth, (ii) populist ultra-nationalism and (iii) the myth of decadence".&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Roger, ''The Nature of Fascism'' (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1991), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism is "a genuinely revolutionary, trans-class form of anti-liberal, and in the last analysis, anti-conservative nationalism" built on a complex range of theoretical and cultural influences. He distinguishes an inter-war period in which it manifested itself in elite-led but populist "armed party" politics opposing socialism and liberalism and promising radical politics to rescue the nation from decadence.&lt;ref name="brookes" /&gt;

[[Robert Paxton]] says that fascism is "a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion".&lt;ref name="anatomnyfascismo" /&gt;

[[Umberto Eco]],&lt;ref name="Eco1995"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051129130630/http://www.justicescholars.org/pegc/archive/Articles/eco_ur-fascism.pdf Umberto Eco: Eternal Fascism, ''The New York Review of Books'', 22 June 1995], [http://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/eco_ur-fascism.pdf archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Passmore,&lt;ref name="Passmore31"&gt;Passmore, Kevin,''Fascism: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; John Weiss,&lt;ref&gt;John Weiss, ''"The Fascist Tradition: Radical Right-Wing Extremism in Modern Europe"'', Harper &amp; Row, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Adams&lt;ref&gt;Ian Adams, ''"Political Ideology Today"'', (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; and Moyra Grant&lt;ref&gt;Moyra Grant, quoted in ''"Key Ideas in Politics"'' (2003) by Nelson Thornes.&lt;/ref&gt; mention [[racism]] as a characteristic component of fascism, e.g. how the fascistic dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] idealized German society as a racially unified and hierarchically organized ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' construct. Fascist philosophies vary by application, but remain distinct by one theoretic commonality. All traditionally fall into the far-right sector of any [[political spectrum]], catalyzed by afflicted class identities over conventional social inequities&lt;ref name="RoutledgeCompanion"/&gt;

[[John Lukacs]], Hungarian-American historian and Holocaust survivor, argues that there is no such thing as generic fascism. He claims that [[National Socialism]] and [[communism]] are essentially manifestations of [[populism]] and that states such as National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy are more different than similar.&lt;ref&gt;Lukacs, John ''The Hitler of History'' New York: Vintage Books, 1997, 1998 p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Position in the political spectrum===

Most scholars place fascism on the far right of the political spectrum.&lt;ref name="RoutledgeCompanion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="university"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aristotle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilhelm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawkesworth"/&gt;  Such scholarship focuses on its [[social conservatism]] and its authoritarian means of opposing [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref name="The Routledge companion to fascism and the far right" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Modern Free Society and Its Nemesis: Liberty Versus Conservatism in the New Millennium"/&gt; Roderick Stackelberg places fascism—including [[Nazism]], which he says is "a radical variant of fascism"—on the political right by explaining: "The more a person deems absolute equality among all people to be a desirable condition, the further left he or she will be on the ideological spectrum. The more a person considers inequality to be unavoidable or even desirable, the further to the right he or she will be".&lt;ref name="google6"/&gt;

Fascism's origins, however, are complex and include many seemingly contradictory viewpoints, ultimately centered around a myth of national rebirth from decadence.&lt;ref name="ah.brookes.ac.uk"&gt;Griffin, Roger: "The Palingenetic Core of Fascism", ''Che cos'è il fascismo? Interpretazioni e prospettive di ricerche'', Ideazione editrice, Rome, 2003 [http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/resources/griffin/coreoffascism.pdf AH.Brookes.ac.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120193621/http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/resources/griffin/coreoffascism.pdf |date=20 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism was founded during [[World War I]] by Italian [[National syndicalism|national syndicalists]] who drew upon both [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] organizational tactics and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] political views.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Phoenix: Fascism in Our Time'', New Brunswick: NJ, Transaction Press, 2009, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Italian Fascism]] gravitated to the right in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="ZeevSternhell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="massachusetts"/&gt; A major element of fascist ideology that has been deemed to be far-right is its stated goal to promote the right of a supposedly superior people to dominate, while purging society of supposedly inferior elements.&lt;ref name="Oliver H. Woshinsky 2008. p. 156"/&gt;

In the 1920s the Italian Fascists described their ideology as right-wing in the political program ''[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]'', stating: "We are free to believe that this is the century of authority, a century tending to the 'right,' a fascist century".&lt;ref name="Jeffrey Thompson Schnapp 2000, p. 57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Benito Mussolini 1935, p. 26"/&gt; Mussolini stated that fascism's position on the political spectrum was not a serious issue for fascists: "Fascism, sitting on the right, could also have sat on the mountain of the center&amp;nbsp;... These words in any case do not have a fixed and unchanged meaning: they do have a variable subject to location, time and spirit. We don't give a damn about these empty terminologies and we despise those who are terrorized by these words".&lt;ref name="Gentile, Emilio 2005. p. 205"/&gt;

Major Italian groups politically on the right, especially rich landowners and big business, feared an uprising by groups on the left such as sharecroppers and labour unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Zygmunt G.

The "Fascist left" included [[Michele Bianchi]], [[Giuseppe Bottai]], [[Angelo Oliviero Olivetti]], [[Sergio Panunzio]] and [[Edmondo Rossoni]], who were committed to advancing [[national syndicalism]] as a replacement for parliamentary liberalism in order to modernize the economy and advance the interests of workers and common people.&lt;ref name="sgp112" /&gt; The "Fascist right" included members of the paramilitary ''Squadristi'' and former members of the [[Italian Nationalist Association]] (ANI).&lt;ref name=sgp112/&gt; The ''Squadristi'' wanted to establish Fascism as a complete dictatorship, while the former ANI members, including [[Alfredo Rocco]], sought to institute an authoritarian corporatist state to replace the liberal state in Italy while retaining the existing elites.&lt;ref name=sgp112/&gt; Upon accommodating the political right, there arose a group of monarchist fascists who sought to use fascism to create an [[absolute monarchy]] under King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]].&lt;ref name=sgp112/&gt;

After King Victor Emmanuel III [[25 Luglio|forced Mussolini to resign]] as head of government and placed him under arrest in 1943, Mussolini was rescued by German forces. While continuing to rely on Germany for support, Mussolini and the remaining loyal Fascists founded the [[Italian Social Republic]] with Mussolini as head of state. Mussolini sought to re-radicalize Italian Fascism, declaring that the Fascist state had been overthrown because Italian Fascism had been subverted by Italian conservatives and the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name="ballbellamy1"&gt;Terence Ball, Richard Bellamy. ''The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought''. p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the new Fascist government proposed the creation of workers' councils and profit-sharing in industry, although the German authorities, who effectively controlled northern Italy at this point, ignored these measures and did not seek to enforce them.&lt;ref name="ballbellamy1"/&gt;

A number of post–World War II fascist movements described themselves as a "[[Third Position|third position]]" outside the traditional political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;"Transcending the beyond: from Third Position to National-Anarchism", Troy Southgate, ed. Griffin (Routeledge) 2003, pp. 377–82&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish [[Falange Española de las JONS|Falangist]] leader José Antonio Primo de Rivera said: "[B]asically the Right stands for the maintenance of an economic structure, albeit an unjust one, while the Left stands for the attempt to subvert that economic structure, even though the subversion thereof would entail the destruction of much that was worthwhile".&lt;ref name="nm54"/&gt;

==="Fascist" as a pejorative===
{{Main|Fascist (insult)}}
The term "fascist" has been used as a [[pejorative]],&lt;ref name="intellectuals"/&gt; regarding varying movements across the far right of the political spectrum.&lt;ref name="orwell1944"/&gt; [[George Orwell]] wrote in 1944 that "the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless&amp;nbsp;... almost any English person would accept 'bully' as a synonym for 'Fascist{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="orwell1944"/&gt;

[[Communist state]]s have sometimes been referred to as "fascist", typically as an insult. For example, it has been applied to [[Marxism|Marxist]] regimes in [[Cuba]] under [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Vietnam]] under [[Ho Chi Minh]].&lt;ref name="rg231"/&gt; Chinese Marxists used the term to denounce the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Sino-Soviet Split]] and likewise the Soviets used the term to denounce Chinese Marxists&lt;ref name="quarantotto"/&gt; and [[social democracy]] (coining a new term in "[[social fascism]]").

In the [[United States]], Herbert Matthews of ''[[The New York Times]]'' asked in 1946: "Should we now place Stalinist Russia in the same category as Hitlerite Germany? Should we say that she is Fascist?".&lt;ref name="matthews"/&gt; [[J. Edgar Hoover]], longtime [[FBI]] director and ardent anti-communist, wrote extensively of "Red Fascism".&lt;ref name="milestonedocuments"/&gt; The [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the 1920s was sometimes called "fascist." Historian Peter Amann states that, "Undeniably, the Klan had some traits in common with European fascism--chauvinism, racism, a mystique of violence, an affirmation of a certain kind of archaic traditionalism--yet their differences were fundamental....[the KKK] never envisioned a change of political or economic system."&lt;ref&gt;Peter H.

==History==
{{further|Fascism and ideology}}

===Nineteenth-century roots===

According to ''Encyclopædia Britannica''{{Better source|date=October 2018}} the roots of fascism are either tied to the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] movement or a 19th-century backlash against the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Common Characteristics Of Fascist Movements|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism/Common-characteristics-of-fascist-movements|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians such as [[Irene Collins]] and [[Howard C Payne]] see [[Napoleon III]], who ran a 'police state' and suppressed the media, as a forerunner of fascism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Lawrence Williams]], ''The Mortal Napoleon The Third'', Princeton University Press, 2015, p28&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David Thomson (historian)|David Thomson]],&lt;ref&gt;David Thomson, ''[[Europe Since Napoleon]]'', Pelican, 1966, p 293&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian [[Risorgimento]] of 1871 led to the 'nemesis of fascism'. [[William L Shirer]]&lt;ref&gt;William Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', Mandarin, 1960, p97&lt;/ref&gt; sees a continuity from the views of [[Fichte]] and [[Hegel]], through [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], to Hitler; [[Robert Gerwarth]] speaks of a 'direct line' from Bismarck to Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gerwarth, ''The Bismarck Myth'', Oxford University Press have, 2005, p166&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julian Dierkes]] sees fascism as a 'particularly violent form of [[Imperialism]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Dierkes, ''Postwar Historical Education in Japan and the Germanies'', Routledge, 2010, p 54&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Fin de siècle'' era and the fusion of Maurrasism with Sorelianism (1880–1914)===
The historian [[Zeev Sternhell]] has traced the ideological roots of fascism back to the 1880s and in particular to the ''[[fin de siècle]]'' theme of that time.&lt;ref name="international" /&gt;&lt;ref name="routledge12" /&gt; The theme was based on a revolt against [[materialism]], [[rationalism]], [[positivism]], bourgeois society and [[democracy]].&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170" /&gt; The ''fin-de-siècle'' generation supported [[emotionalism (disorder)|emotionalism]], [[irrationalism]], [[subjectivism]] and [[vitalism]].&lt;ref name="routledge13" /&gt; The ''fin-de-siècle'' mindset saw civilization as being in a crisis that required a massive and total solution.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170"/&gt; The ''fin-de-siècle'' intellectual school considered the individual only one part of the larger collectivity, which should not be viewed as an atomized numerical sum of individuals.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170"/&gt; They condemned the rationalistic individualism of liberal society and the dissolution of social links in bourgeois society.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170"/&gt;

The ''fin-de-siècle'' outlook was influenced by various intellectual developments, including [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] [[biology]]; [[Gesamtkunstwerk|Wagnerian aesthetics]]; [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s [[Racism|racialism]]; [[Gustave Le Bon]]'s [[psychology]]; and the philosophies of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] and [[Henri Bergson]].&lt;ref name="Zeev 1998 p. 171" /&gt; [[Social Darwinism]], which gained widespread acceptance, made no distinction between physical and social life, and viewed the human condition as being an unceasing struggle to achieve the [[survival of the fittest]].&lt;ref name="Zeev 1998 p. 171"/&gt; Social Darwinism challenged positivism's claim of deliberate and rational choice as the determining behaviour of humans, with social Darwinism focusing on heredity, race, and environment.&lt;ref name="Zeev 1998 p. 171"/&gt; Social Darwinism's emphasis on biogroup identity and the role of organic relations within societies fostered legitimacy and appeal for nationalism.&lt;ref name="routledge14" /&gt; New theories of social and political psychology also rejected the notion of human behaviour being governed by rational choice and instead claimed that emotion was more influential in political issues than reason.&lt;ref name="Zeev 1998 p. 171"/&gt; Nietzsche's argument that "God is dead" coincided with his attack on the "herd mentality" of [[Christianity]], democracy and modern collectivism; his concept of the ''[[übermensch]]''; and his advocacy of the [[will to power]] as a primordial instinct, were major influences upon many of the ''fin-de-siècle'' generation.&lt;ref name="routledge15"/&gt; Bergson's claim of the existence of an "''élan vital''" or vital instinct centred upon free choice and rejected the processes of materialism and determinism; this challenged Marxism.&lt;ref name="routledge16"/&gt;

[[Gaetano Mosca]] in his work ''The Ruling Class'' (1896) developed the theory that claims that in all societies an "organized minority" will dominate and rule over the "disorganized majority".&lt;ref name="William Outhwaite 2006. p. 442"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tracy H. Koon 1943. p. 6"/&gt; Mosca claims that there are only two classes in society, "the governing" (the organized minority) and "the governed" (the disorganized majority).&lt;ref name="Giuseppe Caforio 2006. p. 12"/&gt; He claims that the organized nature of the organized minority makes it irresistible to any individual of the disorganized majority.&lt;ref name="Giuseppe Caforio 2006. p. 12"/&gt;

The anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s concept of [[propaganda of the deed]], which stressed the importance of [[direct action]] as the primary means of politics, including revolutionary violence, became popular among fascists who admired the concept and adopted it as a part of fascism.&lt;ref name="Stuart Joseph Woolf 1970. p. 282" /&gt;

[[French nationalism|French nationalist]] and reactionary monarchist [[Charles Maurras]] influenced fascism.&lt;ref name="nationalism18"/&gt; Maurras promoted what he called [[integral nationalism]], which called for the organic unity of a nation and Maurras insisted that a powerful monarch was an ideal leader of a nation. Maurras distrusted what he considered the democratic mystification of the popular will that created an impersonal collective subject.&lt;ref name="nationalism18"/&gt; He claimed that a powerful monarch was a personified sovereign who could exercise authority to unite a nation's people.&lt;ref name="nationalism18"/&gt; Maurras' integral nationalism was idealized by fascists, but modified into a modernized revolutionary form that was devoid of Maurras' monarchism.&lt;ref name="nationalism18"/&gt;

French revolutionary syndicalist [[Georges Sorel]] promoted the legitimacy of [[political violence]] in his work ''[[Reflections on Violence]]'' (1908) and other works in which he advocated radical syndicalist action to achieve a revolution to overthrow capitalism and the bourgeoisie through a [[general strike]].&lt;ref name="mobilization21" /&gt; In ''Reflections on Violence'', Sorel emphasized need for a revolutionary [[political religion]].&lt;ref name="mobilization22" /&gt; Also in his work ''The Illusions of Progress'', Sorel denounced democracy as reactionary, saying "nothing is more aristocratic than democracy".&lt;ref name="mobilization23" /&gt; By 1909 after the failure of a syndicalist general strike in France, Sorel and his supporters left the radical left and went to the radical right, where they sought to merge militant Catholicism and French patriotism with their views—advocating anti-republican Christian French patriots as ideal revolutionaries.&lt;ref name="mobilization24" /&gt; Initially Sorel had officially been a [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] of Marxism, but by 1910 announced his abandonment of socialist literature and claimed in 1914, using an aphorism of [[Benedetto Croce]] that "socialism is dead" because of the "decomposition of Marxism".&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1994 p. 78" /&gt; Sorel became a supporter of reactionary Maurrassian nationalism beginning in 1909 that influenced his works.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1994 p. 78"/&gt; Maurras held interest in merging his nationalist ideals with [[Sorelianism|Sorelian]] [[syndicalism]] as a means to confront [[democracy]].&lt;ref name="revolution1994" /&gt; Maurras stated "a socialism liberated from the democratic and cosmopolitan element fits nationalism well as a well made glove fits a beautiful hand".&lt;ref name="multiculturalism" /&gt;

[[File:EnricoCorradini.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Enrico Corradini]]]]
The fusion of Maurrassian nationalism and Sorelian syndicalism influenced radical Italian nationalist [[Enrico Corradini]].&lt;ref name="zs163" /&gt; Corradini spoke of the need for a [[National syndicalism|nationalist-syndicalist]] movement, led by elitist aristocrats and anti-democrats who shared a revolutionary syndicalist commitment to direct action and a willingness to fight.&lt;ref name=zs163/&gt; Corradini spoke of Italy as being a "proletarian nation" that needed to pursue [[imperialism]] in order to challenge the "[[Plutocracy|plutocratic]]" French and British.&lt;ref name="mb9" /&gt; Corradini's views were part of a wider set of perceptions within the right-wing [[Italian Nationalist Association]] (ANI), which claimed that Italy's economic backwardness was caused by corruption in its political class, [[liberalism]], and division caused by "ignoble socialism".&lt;ref name=mb9/&gt; The ANI held ties and influence among [[Conservatism|conservatives]], Catholics and the business community.&lt;ref name=mb9/&gt; Italian national syndicalists held a common set of principles: the rejection of [[bourgeois]] values, [[democracy]], liberalism, [[Marxism]], [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and [[pacifism]]; and the promotion of [[heroism]], [[vitalism]] and violence.&lt;ref name="revolution" /&gt; The ANI claimed that liberal democracy was no longer compatible with the modern world, and advocated a strong state and imperialism, claiming that humans are naturally predatory and that nations were in a constant struggle, in which only the strongest could survive.&lt;ref name="nationalism25" /&gt;

[[File:Manifesto of Futurism.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], Italian modernist author of the ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'' (1909) and later the co-author of the ''[[Fascist Manifesto]]'' (1919)]]
Futurism was both an artistic-cultural movement and initially a political movement in Italy led by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] who founded the ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'' (1908), that championed the causes of modernism, action, and political violence as necessary elements of politics while denouncing liberalism and parliamentary politics. Marinetti rejected conventional democracy based on majority rule and egalitarianism, for a new form of democracy, promoting what he described in his work "The Futurist Conception of Democracy" as the following: "We are therefore able to give the directions to create and to dismantle to numbers, to quantity, to the mass, for with us number, quantity and mass will never be—as they are in Germany and Russia—the number, quantity and mass of mediocre men, incapable and indecisive".&lt;ref name="aesthetics" /&gt;

Futurism influenced fascism in its emphasis on recognizing the virile nature of violent action and war as being necessities of modern civilization.&lt;ref name="Gigliola Gori 2004. p. 14"&gt;Gigliola Gori. ''Italian Fascism and the Female Body: Submissive Women and Strong Mothers''. Oxfordshire, England; New York, New York: Routledge, 2004. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Marinetti promoted the need of physical training of young men, saying that in male education, gymnastics should take precedence over books, and he advocated segregation of the genders on this matter, in that womanly sensibility must not enter men's education whom Marinetti claimed must be "lively, bellicose, muscular and violently dynamic".&lt;ref&gt;Gigliola Gori. ''Italian Fascism and the Female Body: Submissive Women and Strong Mothers''. Oxfordshire, England; New York, New York: Routledge, 2004. pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I and its aftermath (1914–1929)===
At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Italian political left became severely split over its position on the war. The [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI) opposed the war but a number of Italian revolutionary syndicalists supported war against Germany and Austria-Hungary on the grounds that their reactionary regimes had to be defeated to ensure the success of socialism.&lt;ref name="zs175" /&gt; [[Angelo Oliviero Olivetti]] formed a pro-interventionist [[fascio]] called the [[Fasci d'Azione Internazionalista|Fasci of International Action]] in October 1914.&lt;ref name=zs175/&gt; Benito Mussolini upon being expelled from his position as chief editor of the PSI's newspaper ''[[Avanti! (Italian newspaper)|Avanti!]]'' for his anti-German stance, joined the interventionist cause in a separate fascio.&lt;ref name="revolution27" /&gt; The term "Fascism" was first used in 1915 by members of Mussolini's movement, the [[Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria|Fasci of Revolutionary Action]].&lt;ref name="journalist" /&gt;

The first meeting of the Fasci of Revolutionary Action was held on 24 January 1915&lt;ref name="Paul O p. 41"&gt;Paul O'Brien. Mussolini in the First World War: The Journalist, The Soldier, The Fascist. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; when Mussolini declared that it was necessary for Europe to resolve its national problems—including national borders—of Italy and elsewhere "for the ideals of justice and liberty for which oppressed peoples must acquire the right to belong to those national communities from which they descended".&lt;ref name="Paul O p. 41"/&gt;  Attempts to hold mass meetings were ineffective and the organization was regularly harassed by government authorities and socialists.&lt;ref name="Gregor-1979-pp-195-196"&gt;Gregor 1979, pp.&amp;nbsp;195–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar political ideas arose in Germany after the outbreak of the war. German sociologist [[Johann Plenge]] spoke of the rise of a "National Socialism" in Germany within what he termed the "ideas of 1914" that were a declaration of war against the "ideas of 1789" (the [[French Revolution]]).&lt;ref name="Martin Kitchen 2006. p. 205" /&gt; According to Plenge, the "ideas of 1789" that included rights of man, democracy, individualism and liberalism were being rejected in favor of "the ideas of 1914" that included "German values" of duty, discipline, law and order.&lt;ref name="Martin Kitchen 2006. p. 205"/&gt; Plenge believed that racial solidarity (''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'') would replace class division and that "racial comrades" would unite to create a socialist society in the struggle of "proletarian" Germany against "capitalist" Britain.&lt;ref name="Martin Kitchen 2006. p. 205"/&gt; He believed that the "[[Spirit of 1914]]" manifested itself in the concept of the "People's League of National Socialism".&lt;ref name="Bernd-Rüdiger Hüppauf 1997. p. 92" /&gt; This National Socialism was a form of state socialism that rejected the "idea of boundless freedom" and promoted an economy that would serve the whole of Germany under the leadership of the state.&lt;ref name="Bernd-Rüdiger Hüppauf 1997. p. 92"/&gt; This National Socialism was opposed to capitalism because of the components that were against "the national interest" of Germany, but insisted that National Socialism would strive for greater efficiency in the economy.&lt;ref name="Bernd-Rüdiger Hüppauf 1997. p. 92"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CritTheory /&gt; Plenge advocated an authoritarian rational ruling elite to develop National Socialism through a hierarchical [[Technocracy|technocratic]] state.&lt;ref name="Thomas Rohkrämer 2007. p. 130" /&gt;

====Impact of World War I====
Fascists viewed World War I as bringing revolutionary changes in the nature of war, society, the state and technology, as the advent of [[total war]] and mass mobilization had broken down the distinction between civilian and combatant, as civilians had become a critical part in economic production for the war effort and thus arose a "military citizenship" in which all citizens were involved to the military in some manner during the war.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mann65"/&gt; World War I had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines or provide economic production and logistics to support those on the front lines, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mann65" /&gt; Fascists viewed technological developments of weaponry and the state's total mobilization of its population in the war as symbolizing the beginning of a new era fusing state power with [[mass politics]], technology and particularly the mobilizing myth that they contended had triumphed over the myth of progress and the era of liberalism.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;

[[File:Italian Arditi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Members of Italy's ''[[Arditi]]'' corps (here in 1918 holding daggers, a symbol of their group), which was formed in 1917 as groups of soldiers trained for dangerous missions, characterized by refusal to surrender and willingness to fight to the death. Their black uniforms inspired those of the Italian Fascist movement.]]

====Impact of the Bolshevik Revolution====
The [[October Revolution]] of 1917—in which [[Bolshevik]] communists led by [[Vladimir Lenin]] seized power in Russia—greatly influenced the development of fascism.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 95-96" /&gt; In 1917, Mussolini, as leader of the [[Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria|Fasci of Revolutionary Action]], praised the October Revolution, but later he became unimpressed with Lenin, regarding him as merely a new version of Tsar Nicholas.&lt;ref name="Peter Neville 2004. p. 36" /&gt; After World War I, fascists have commonly campaigned on anti-Marxist agendas.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 95-96"/&gt;

Liberal opponents of both fascism and the Bolsheviks argue that there are various similarities between the two, including that they believed in the necessity of a vanguard leadership, had disdain for bourgeois values and it is argued had totalitarian ambitions.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 95-96"/&gt; In practice, both have commonly emphasized revolutionary action, proletarian nation theories, one-party states and party-armies.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 95-96"/&gt; However, both draw clear distinctions from each other both in aims and tactics, with the Bolsheviks emphasizing the need for an [[Soviet democracy|organized participatory democracy]] and an egalitarian, [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] vision for society while the fascists emphasize [[hyper-nationalism]] and open hostility towards democracy, envisioning a hierarchical social structure as essential to their aims.

With the antagonism between anti-interventionist Marxists and pro-interventionist Fascists complete by the end of the war, the two sides became irreconcilable. The Fascists presented themselves as [[Anti-communism|anti-Marxists]] and as opposed to the Marxists.&lt;ref name="revolution28" /&gt; Mussolini consolidated control over the Fascist movement, known as [[Sansepolcrismo]], in 1919 with the founding of the ''[[Fasci italiani di combattimento]]''.

====The ''Fascist Manifesto'' of 1919====
In 1919, [[Alceste De Ambris]] and [[Futurism|Futurist]] movement leader [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] created ''[[Fascist Manifesto|The Manifesto of the Italian Fasci of Combat]]'' (the ''Fascist Manifesto'').&lt;ref name="connecticut30" /&gt; The Manifesto was presented on 6 June 1919 in the Fascist newspaper ''Il Popolo d'Italia''. The Manifesto supported the creation of [[universal suffrage]] for both men [[women's suffrage|and women]] (the latter being realized only partly in late 1925, with all opposition parties banned or disbanded);&lt;ref name="passmore" /&gt; [[proportional representation]] on a regional basis; government representation through a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] system of "National Councils" of experts, selected from professionals and tradespeople, elected to represent and hold legislative power over their respective areas, including labour, industry, transportation, public health, communications, etc.; and the abolition of the [[Italian Senate]].&lt;ref name="massachusetts31" /&gt; The Manifesto supported the creation of an [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] for all workers, a [[minimum wage]], worker representation in industrial management, equal confidence in labour unions as in industrial executives and public servants, reorganization of the transportation sector, revision of the draft law on invalidity insurance, reduction of the retirement age from 65 to 55, a strong [[progressive tax]] on capital, confiscation of the property of religious institutions and abolishment of bishoprics, and revision of military contracts to allow the government to seize 85% of profits.&lt;ref name="massachusetts32" /&gt; It also called for the fulfillment of expansionist aims in the Balkans and other parts of the Mediterranean,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paxton |first1=Robert |title=The Anatomy of Fascism |date=March 2005 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-307-42812-7 |edition=First Vintage Books |chapter=Chapter 1, The Invention of Fascism}}&lt;/ref&gt; the creation of a short-service national militia to serve defensive duties, [[nationalization]] of the armaments industry and a foreign policy designed to be peaceful but also competitive.&lt;ref name="massachusetts33" /&gt;

[[File:Fiume cheering D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Residents of [[Rijeka|Fiume]] cheer the arrival of [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] and his blackshirt-wearing nationalist raiders, as D'Annunzio and Fascist [[Alceste De Ambris]] developed the quasi-fascist [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]] (a city-state in Fiume) from 1919 to 1920 and whose actions by D'Annunzio in Fiume inspired the Italian Fascist movement]]
The next events that influenced the Fascists in Italy was the raid of [[Fiume (city)|Fiume]] by Italian nationalist [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] and the founding of the [[Charter of Carnaro]] in 1920.&lt;ref name="revolution34" /&gt; D'Annunzio and De Ambris designed the Charter, which advocated [[National syndicalism|national-syndicalist]] [[Corporatism|corporatist]] [[productionism]] alongside D'Annunzio's political views.&lt;ref name="revolution35" /&gt; Many Fascists saw the Charter of Carnaro as an ideal constitution for a Fascist Italy.&lt;ref name="zs189" /&gt; This behaviour of aggression towards Yugoslavia and [[South Slavs]] was pursued by Italian Fascists with their persecution of South Slavs—especially Slovenes and Croats.

====Italian Fascists in 1920====
In 1920, militant strike activity by industrial workers reached its peak in Italy and 1919 and 1920 were known as the [[Biennio Rosso|"Red Years"]].&lt;ref name="massachusetts36" /&gt; Mussolini and the Fascists took advantage of the situation by allying with industrial businesses and attacking workers and peasants in the name of preserving order and internal peace in Italy.&lt;ref name="massachusetts37" /&gt;

Fascists identified their primary opponents as the majority of socialists on the left who had opposed intervention in World War I.&lt;ref name=zs189/&gt; The Fascists and the Italian political right held common ground: both held Marxism in contempt, discounted class consciousness and believed in the rule of elites.&lt;ref name="zs193" /&gt; The Fascists assisted the anti-socialist campaign by allying with the other parties and the conservative right in a mutual effort to destroy the Italian Socialist Party and labour organizations committed to class identity above national identity.&lt;ref name=zs193/&gt;

Fascism sought to accommodate Italian conservatives by making major alterations to its political agenda—abandoning its previous [[populism]], [[republicanism]] and [[anticlericalism]], adopting policies in support of [[free enterprise]] and accepting the [[Catholic Church]] and the monarchy as institutions in Italy.&lt;ref name="ga145" /&gt; To appeal to Italian conservatives, Fascism adopted policies such as promoting family values, including promotion policies designed to reduce the number of women in the workforce limiting the woman's role to that of a mother. The fascists banned literature on birth control and increased penalties for abortion in 1926, declaring both crimes against the state.&lt;ref name="conservatives" /&gt; Though Fascism adopted a number of anti-modern positions designed to appeal to people upset with the new trends in sexuality and women's rights &amp;ndash; especially those with a [[reactionary]] point of view &amp;ndash; the Fascists sought to maintain Fascism's revolutionary character, with Angelo Oliviero Olivetti saying: "Fascism would like to be conservative, but it will [be] by being revolutionary".&lt;ref name="revolution38" /&gt; The Fascists supported revolutionary action and committed to secure law and order to appeal to both conservatives and syndicalists.&lt;ref name="conservatives39" /&gt;

Prior to Fascism's accommodations to the political right, Fascism was a small, urban, northern Italian movement that had about a thousand members.&lt;ref name="massachusetts40" /&gt; After Fascism's accommodation of the political right, the Fascist movement's membership soared to approximately 250,000 by 1921.&lt;ref name="massachusetts41" /&gt;

====Fascist violence in 1922====
Beginning in 1922, Fascist paramilitaries escalated their strategy from one of attacking socialist offices and homes of socialist leadership figures to one of violent occupation of cities. The Fascists met little serious resistance from authorities and proceeded to take over several northern Italian cities.&lt;ref name="rop87"/&gt; The Fascists attacked the headquarters of socialist and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] labour unions in Cremona and imposed forced Italianization upon the German-speaking population of Trent and Bolzano.&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt; After seizing these cities, the Fascists made plans to take [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt;

[[File:March on Rome.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Benito Mussolini]] with three of the four [[quadrumvirs]] during the [[March on Rome]] (from left to right: unknown, [[Emilio de Bono|de Bono]], Mussolini, [[Italo Balbo|Balbo]] and [[Cesare Maria de Vecchi|de Vecchi]])]]
On 24 October 1922, the Fascist party held its annual congress in [[Naples]], where Mussolini ordered Blackshirts to take control of public buildings and trains and to converge on three points around Rome.&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt; The Fascists managed to seize control of several post offices and trains in northern Italy while the Italian government, led by a left-wing coalition, was internally divided and unable to respond to the Fascist advances.&lt;ref name="rop88" /&gt; King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] perceived the risk of bloodshed in Rome in response to attempting to disperse the Fascists to be too high.&lt;ref name="rop90" /&gt; Victor Emmanuel III decided to appoint Mussolini as [[Prime Minister of Italy]] and Mussolini arrived in Rome on 30 October to accept the appointment.&lt;ref name=rop90/&gt; Fascist propaganda aggrandized this event, known as "[[March on Rome]]", as a "seizure" of power because of Fascists' heroic exploits.&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt;

===Fascist Italy===
Historian [[Stanley G. Payne]] says Fascism in Italy was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A primarily political dictatorship....The Fascist Party itself had become almost completely bureaucratized and subservient to, not dominant over, the state itself. Big business, industry, and finance retained extensive autonomy, particularly in the early years. The armed forces also enjoyed considerable autonomy....The Fascist militia was placed under military control....The judicial system was left largely intact and relatively autonomous as well. The police continued to be directed by state officials and were not taken over by party leaders...nor was a major new police elite created....There was never any question of bringing the Church under overall subservience.... Sizable sectors of Italian cultural life retained extensive autonomy, and no major state propaganda-and-culture ministry existed....The Mussolini regime was neither especially sanguinary nor particularly repressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley G. Payne|title=A History of Fascism, 1914–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_MeR06xqXAC&amp;pg=PA122|year=1996|publisher=U of Wisconsin Press|page=122|isbn=9780299148737}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Mussolini in power====
Upon being appointed Prime Minister of Italy, Mussolini had to form a coalition government because the Fascists did not have control over the Italian parliament.&lt;ref name="sgp110" /&gt; Mussolini's coalition government initially pursued [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] policies under the direction of liberal finance minister [[Alberto De Stefani]], a member of the Center Party, including balancing the budget through deep cuts to the civil service.&lt;ref name=sgp110/&gt; Initially, little drastic change in government policy had occurred and repressive police actions were limited.&lt;ref name=sgp110/&gt;

The Fascists began their attempt to entrench Fascism in Italy with the [[Acerbo Law]], which guaranteed a plurality of the seats in parliament to any party or coalition list in an election that received 25% or more of the vote.&lt;ref name="sgp113" /&gt; Through considerable Fascist violence and intimidation, the list won a majority of the vote, allowing many seats to go to the Fascists.&lt;ref name=sgp113/&gt; In the aftermath of the election, a crisis and political scandal erupted after Socialist Party deputy [[Giacomo Matteotti]] was kidnapped and murdered by a Fascist.&lt;ref name=sgp113/&gt; The liberals and the leftist minority in parliament walked out in protest in what became known as the [[Aventine Secession (20th century)|Aventine Secession]].&lt;ref name="sgp114" /&gt; On 3 January 1925, Mussolini addressed the Fascist-dominated Italian parliament and declared that he was personally responsible for what happened, but insisted that he had done nothing wrong. Mussolini proclaimed himself dictator of Italy, assuming full responsibility over the government and announcing the dismissal of parliament.&lt;ref name=sgp114/&gt; From 1925 to 1929, Fascism steadily became entrenched in power: opposition deputies were denied access to parliament, censorship was introduced and a December 1925 decree made Mussolini solely responsible to the King.&lt;ref name="routledge42" /&gt;

====Catholic Church====
In 1929, the Fascist regime briefly gained what was in effect a blessing of the Catholic Church after the regime signed a concordat with the Church, known as the [[Lateran Treaty]], which gave the papacy state sovereignty and financial compensation for the seizure of Church lands by the liberal state in the nineteenth century, but within two years the Church had renounced Fascism in the Encyclical [[Non Abbiamo Bisogno]] as a "pagan idolotry of the state" which teaches "hatred, violence and irreverence".&lt;ref name="routledge43" /&gt; Not long after signing the agreement, by Mussolini's own confession the Church had threatened to have him “excommunicated”, in part because of his intractable nature and that he had "confiscated more issues of Catholic newspapers in the next three months than in the previous seven years”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Denis Mack Smith]], ''Mussolini'', New York: NY, Vintage Books, 1983, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1930s, Mussolini became more vocal in his anti-clerical rhetoric, repeatedly denouncing the Catholic Church and discussing ways to depose the pope. He took the position that the “papacy was a malignant tumor in the body of Italy and must 'be rooted out once and for all,’ because there was no room in Rome for both the Pope and himself".&lt;ref&gt;[[Denis Mack Smith]], ''Mussolini'', pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1974 book, Mussolini's widow Rachele stated that her husband had always been an atheist until near the end of his life, writing that her husband was “basically irreligious until the later years of his life”.&lt;ref&gt;Rachele Mussolini, ''Mussolini: An Intimate Biography'', New York: NY, Pocket Books, 1977, p. 131. Originally published by William Morrow in 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Socialists of Germany employed similar anti-clerical policies. The Gestapo confiscated hundreds of monasteries in Austria and Germany, evicted clergymen and laymen alike and often replaced crosses with a swastikas.&lt;ref&gt;Jochen von Lang, ''The Secretary: Martin Bormann, The Man Who Manipulated Hitler'', New York: NY, Random House, 1979, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the swastika as the “Devil’s Cross”, church leaders found their youth organizations banned, their meetings limited and various Catholic periodicals censored or banned. Government officials eventually found it necessary to place “Nazis into editorial positions in the Catholic press”.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Evans, ''The Third Reich in Power'', New York: NY, Penguin, 2005, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 2,720 clerics, mostly Catholics, were arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned inside of Germany's Dachau concentration camp, resulting in over 1,000 deaths&lt;ref&gt;Paul Berben, ''Dachau, 1933–1945: The Official History'', Norfolk Press 1975, p. 276-277&lt;/ref&gt;

====Corporatist economic system====
The Fascist regime created a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] economic system in 1925 with creation of the Palazzo Vidioni Pact, in which the Italian employers' association [[Confindustria]] and Fascist trade unions agreed to recognize each other as the sole representatives of Italy's employers and employees, excluding non-Fascist trade unions.&lt;ref name="cb150" /&gt; The Fascist regime first created a Ministry of Corporations that organized the Italian economy into 22 sectoral corporations, banned workers' strikes and lock-outs and in 1927 created the [[Labour Charter of 1927|Charter of Labour]], which established workers' rights and duties and created labour tribunals to arbitrate employer-employee disputes.&lt;ref name=cb150/&gt; In practice, the sectoral corporations exercised little independence and were largely controlled by the regime and employee organizations were rarely led by employees themselves, but instead by appointed Fascist party members.&lt;ref name=cb150/&gt;

====Aggressive foreign policy====
In the 1920s, Fascist Italy pursued an aggressive foreign policy that included an attack on the Greek island of [[Corfu]], aims to expand Italian territory in the [[Balkans]], plans to wage war against [[Turkey]] and [[Yugoslavia]], attempts to bring Yugoslavia into civil war by supporting Croat and Macedonian separatists to legitimize Italian intervention and making [[Albania]] a ''[[de facto]]'' [[protectorate]] of Italy, which was achieved through diplomatic means by 1927.&lt;ref name="expansionism" /&gt; In response to revolt in the Italian colony of [[Libya]], Fascist Italy abandoned previous liberal-era colonial policy of cooperation with local leaders. Instead, claiming that Italians were a superior race to African races and thereby had the right to colonize the "inferior" Africans, it sought to settle 10 to 15 million Italians in Libya.&lt;ref name="aaa134" /&gt; This resulted in an aggressive military campaign known as the [[Pacification of Libya]] against natives in Libya, including mass killings, the use of [[concentration camp]]s and the forced starvation of thousands of people.&lt;ref name=aaa134/&gt; Italian authorities committed [[ethnic cleansing]] by forcibly expelling 100,000 [[Bedouins|Bedouin]] Cyrenaicans, half the population of Cyrenaica in Libya, from their settlements that was slated to be given to Italian settlers.&lt;ref name="mussolini" /&gt;&lt;ref name="university44" /&gt;

====Hitler adopts Italian model====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-1486, Hitler-Putsch, München, Marienplatz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Nazis in Munich during the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]]]
The March on Rome brought Fascism international attention. One early admirer of the Italian Fascists was [[Adolf Hitler]], who less than a month after the March had begun to model himself and the [[Nazi Party]] upon Mussolini and the Fascists.&lt;ref name="kershaw" /&gt; The Nazis, led by Hitler and the German war hero [[Erich Ludendorff]], attempted a "March on Berlin" modeled upon the March on Rome, which resulted in the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in [[Munich]] in November 1923.&lt;ref name="dissolution" /&gt;

===International impact of the Great Depression and the buildup to World War II&lt;!--'Para-fascism' and 'Para-fascist' redirect here--&gt;===
[[File:Hitlermusso2 edit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Benito Mussolini]] (left) and [[Adolf Hitler]] (right)]]

The conditions of economic hardship caused by the [[Great Depression]] brought about an international surge of social unrest. According to historian Philip Morgan, "the onset of the Great Depression...was the greatest stimulus yet to the diffusion and expansion of fascism outside Italy".&lt;ref name="Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945"&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=acGhRyqfuGIC&amp;pg=PT203&amp;lpg=PT203&amp;dq=Philip+Morgan,+Fascism+in+Europe,+%22third+way%22#v=onepage&amp;q=third%20position Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945] Philip Morgan, ''Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945, New York Tayolor &amp; Francis 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist propaganda blamed the problems of the long depression of the 1930s on minorities and [[scapegoat]]s: “[[anti-semitism|Judeo]]-[[Freemasonry|Masonic]]-[[Bolshevism|bolshevik]]” conspiracies, [[Left-wing politics#Nationalism and anti-nationalism|left-wing internationalism]] and the presence of [[immigrant]]s.

In Germany, it contributed to the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]], which resulted in the demise of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the establishment of the fascist regime, [[Nazi Germany]], under the leadership of [[Adolf Hitler]]. With the rise of Hitler and the Nazis to power in 1933, [[liberal democracy]] was dissolved in Germany and the Nazis mobilized the country for war, with expansionist territorial aims against several countries. In the 1930s, the Nazis implemented racial laws that deliberately discriminated against, [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]] and persecuted Jews and other racial and minority groups.

Fascist movements grew in strength elsewhere in Europe. Hungarian fascist [[Gyula Gömbös]] rose to power as Prime Minister of [[Hungary]] in 1932 and attempted to entrench his [[Party of Hungarian Life|Party of National Unity]] throughout the country. He created an eight-hour work day, a forty-eight-hour work week in industry and sought to entrench a corporatist economy; and pursued irredentist claims on Hungary's neighbors.&lt;ref name="routledge45" /&gt; The fascist [[Iron Guard]] movement in [[Romania]] soared in political support after 1933, gaining representation in the Romanian government and an Iron Guard member assassinated Romanian prime minister [[Ion Duca]].&lt;ref name="routledge46" /&gt; During the [[6 February 1934 crisis]], [[France]] faced the greatest domestic political turmoil since the [[Dreyfus Affair]] when the fascist [[Mouvement Franciste|Francist Movement]] and multiple far-right movements rioted ''[[en masse]]'' in Paris against the French government resulting in major political violence.&lt;ref name="fascism" /&gt; A variety of '''para-fascist'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; governments that borrowed elements from fascism were formed during the Great Depression, including those of [[Greece]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]] and [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="routledge47" /&gt;

[[File:SaudacaoIntegralista1935.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brazilian Integralism|Integralists]] marching in Brazil]]
In the Americas, the [[Brazilian Integralism|Brazilian Integralists]] led by [[Plínio Salgado]] claimed as many as 200,000 members although following coup attempts it faced a crackdown from the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] of [[Getúlio Vargas]] in 1937.&lt;ref name="griffin" /&gt; In the 1930s, the [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]] gained seats in [[Chile]]'s parliament and attempted a coup d'état that resulted in the [[Seguro Obrero massacre]] of 1938.&lt;ref name="routledge48" /&gt;

During the Great Depression, Mussolini promoted active state intervention in the economy. He denounced the contemporary "[[Supercapitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|supercapitalism]]" that he claimed began in 1914 as a failure because of its alleged [[decadence]], its support for unlimited [[consumerism]] and its intention to create the "standardization of humankind".&lt;ref name="gb2000" /&gt; Fascist Italy created the [[Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale|Institute for Industrial Reconstruction]] (IRI), a giant state-owned firm and holding company that provided state funding to failing private enterprises.&lt;ref name="cb189" /&gt; The IRI was made a permanent institution in Fascist Italy in 1937, pursued Fascist policies to create national [[autarky]] and had the power to take over private firms to maximize war production.&lt;ref name=cb189/&gt; While Hitler's regime only nationalized 500 companies in key industries by the early 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Overy, ''War and Economy in the Third Reich'', Clarendon Press (Oxford University Press), 1994, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini declared in 1934 that “[t]hree-fourths of Italian economy, industrial and agricultural, is in the hands of the state”.&lt;ref&gt;Gianni Toniolo, editor, ''The Oxford Handbook of the Italian Economy Since Unification'', Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 59; Mussolini’s speech to the Chamber of Deputies was on May 26, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the worldwide depression, Mussolini's government was able to take over most of Italy's largest failing banks, who held controlling interest in many Italian businesses. The Institute for Industrial Reconstruction, a state-operated holding company in charge of bankrupt banks and companies, reported in early 1934 that they held assets of “48.5 percent of the share capital of Italy”, which later included the capital of the banks themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Gianni Toniolo, editor, ''The Oxford Handbook of the Italian Economy Since Unification'', Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Political historian Martin Blinkhorn estimated Italy's scope of state intervention and ownership “greatly surpassed that in Nazi Germany, giving Italy a public sector second only to that of Stalin’s Russia”.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Blinkhorn, Mussolini and Fascist Italy, New York: NY, Routledge, 1991, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1930s, Italy enacted manufacturing cartels, tariff barriers, currency restrictions and massive regulation of the economy to attempt to balance payments.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. p. 72"/&gt; Italy's policy of autarky failed to achieve effective economic autonomy.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. p. 72"/&gt; Nazi Germany similarly pursued an economic agenda with the aims of autarky and rearmament and imposed [[Protectionism|protectionist]] policies, including forcing the German steel industry to use lower-quality German iron ore rather than superior-quality imported iron.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia49"/&gt;

===World War II (1939–1945)===
In Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, both Mussolini and Hitler pursued territorial expansionist and [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist foreign policy]] agendas from the 1930s through the 1940s culminating in World War II. Mussolini called for [[Irredentism|irredentist]] Italian claims to be reclaimed, establishing Italian domination of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and securing Italian access to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the creation of Italian ''[[spazio vitale]]'' ("vital space") in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Red Sea]] regions.&lt;ref name="expansionism50" /&gt; Hitler called for [[Irredentism|irredentist]] German claims to be reclaimed along with the creation of German ''[[Lebensraum]]'' ("living space") in Eastern Europe, including territories held by the [[Soviet Union]], that would be colonized by Germans.&lt;ref name="expansionism51" /&gt;

[[File:Inmate at the Rab concentration camp.jpg|thumb|left|[[Emaciation|Emaciated]] male inmate at the Italian [[Rab concentration camp]]]]
From 1935 to 1939, Germany and Italy escalated their demands for territorial claims and greater influence in world affairs. Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded Ethiopia in 1935]] resulting in its condemnation by the [[League of Nations]] and its widespread diplomatic isolation. In 1936, Germany [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized the industrial Rhineland]], a region that had been ordered demilitarized by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. In 1938, Germany annexed [[Austria]] and Italy assisted Germany in resolving the diplomatic crisis between Germany versus Britain and France over claims on [[Czechoslovakia]] by arranging the [[Munich Agreement]] that gave Germany the [[Sudetenland]] and was perceived at the time to have averted a European war. These hopes faded when Hitler violated the Munich Agreement by ordering the invasion and partition of Czechoslovakia between Germany and a client state of [[Slovakia]] in 1939. At the same time from 1938 to 1939, Italy was demanding territorial and colonial concessions from France and Britain.&lt;ref name="university52" /&gt; In 1939, Germany prepared for war with Poland, but attempted to gain territorial concessions from Poland through diplomatic means.&lt;ref name="Eugene Davidson pp. 371-372" /&gt; The Polish government did not trust Hitler's promises and refused to accept Germany's demands.&lt;ref name="Eugene Davidson pp. 371-372"/&gt;

The invasion of Poland by Germany was deemed unacceptable by Britain, France and their allies, resulting in their mutual declaration of war against Germany that was deemed the aggressor in the war in Poland, resulting in the outbreak of World War II. In 1940, Mussolini led Italy into World War II on the side of the Axis. Mussolini was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity to carry out a long war with France or the United Kingdom and waited until France was on the verge of imminent collapse and surrender from the German invasion before declaring war on France and the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940 on the assumption that the war would be short-lived following France's collapse.&lt;ref name="university53" /&gt; Mussolini believed that following a brief entry of Italy into war with France, followed by the imminent French surrender, Italy could gain some territorial concessions from France and then concentrate its forces on a major offensive in [[Egypt]] where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces.&lt;ref name="university54" /&gt; Plans by Germany to invade the United Kingdom in 1940 failed after Germany lost the aerial warfare campaign in the [[Battle of Britain]]. In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe. The war became prolonged—contrary to Mussolini's plans—resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance.

[[File:Buchenwald Corpses 60623.jpg|thumb|right|Corpses of victims of the German [[Buchenwald concentration camp]]]]
During World War II, the Axis Powers in Europe led by Nazi Germany participated in the extermination of millions of Poles, Jews, Gypsies and others in the [[genocide]] known as the [[Holocaust]].

After 1942, Axis forces began to falter. In 1943, after Italy faced multiple military failures, the complete reliance and subordination of Italy to Germany, the Allied invasion of Italy and the corresponding international humiliation, Mussolini [[25 Luglio|was removed as head of government and arrested]] on the order of King Victor Emmanuel III, who proceeded to dismantle the Fascist state and declared Italy's switching of allegiance to the Allied side. Mussolini was rescued from arrest by German forces and led the German client state, the [[Italian Social Republic]] from 1943 to 1945. Nazi Germany faced multiple losses and steady Soviet and Western Allied offensives from 1943 to 1945.

On 28 April 1945, Mussolini was captured and executed by Italian communist partisans. On 30 April 1945, Hitler committed suicide. Shortly afterwards, Germany surrendered and the Nazi regime was [[denazification|systematically dismantled]] by the occupying Allied powers. An International Military Tribunal was subsequently convened in [[Nuremberg#Nazi era|Nuremberg]]. Beginning in November 1945 and lasting through 1949, numerous Nazi political, military and economic leaders were [[Nuremberg trials|tried and convicted]] of [[war crime]]s, with many of the worst offenders receiving the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].

===Post–World War II (1945–present)===
{{Main|Neo-fascism}}

[[File:Juan Peron con banda de presidente.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Juan Perón]], [[President of Argentina]] from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974, admired [[Italian Fascism]] and modelled his economic policies on those pursued by Fascist Italy]]

The victory of the Allies over the Axis powers in [[World War II]] led to the collapse of many fascist regimes in Europe. The [[Nuremberg Trials]] convicted several Nazi leaders of crimes against humanity involving the Holocaust. However, there remained several movements and governments that were ideologically related to fascism.

[[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Falangism|Falangist]] one-party state in Spain was officially neutral during World War II and it survived the collapse of the Axis Powers. Franco's rise to power had been directly assisted by the militaries of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and Franco had sent volunteers to fight on the side of Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union during World War II. The first years were characterized by a repression against the anti-fascist ideologies, a deep censorship and the suppression of democratic institutions (elected Parliament, [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|Constitution of 1931]], Regional Statutes of Autonomy). After World War II and a period of international isolation, Franco's regime normalized relations with the Western powers during the [[Cold War]], until Franco's death in 1975 and the transformation of Spain into a liberal democracy.

[[File:Giorgio Almirante.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Giorgio Almirante]], leader of the [[Italian Social Movement]] from 1969–1987]]

Historian [[Robert Paxton]] observes that one of the main problems in defining fascism is that it was widely mimicked. Paxton says: "In fascism's heyday, in the 1930s, many regimes that were not functionally fascist borrowed elements of fascist decor in order to lend themselves an aura of force, vitality, and mass mobilization". He goes on to observe that Salazar "crushed Portuguese fascism after he had copied some of its techniques of popular mobilization".&lt;ref&gt;Robert O. Paxton, "The five stages of fascism." ''Journal of Modern History'' 70.1 (1998): 1-23, quotes  at pp 3, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portugal]] was under the control of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], a dictatorship led by [[António de Oliveira Salazar]]. In Argentina, [[Peronism]], associated with the regime of [[Juan Perón]] from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974, was  influenced by fascism.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 512" /&gt; Between 1939 and 1941, prior to his rise to power, Perón had developed a deep admiration of Italian Fascism and modelled his economic policies on Italian Fascist policies.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 512"/&gt;

The term [[neo-fascism]] refers to fascist movements after World War II. In Italy, the [[Italian Social Movement]] led by [[Giorgio Almirante]] was a major neo-fascist movement that transformed itself into a self-described "post-fascist" movement called the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] (AN), which has been an ally of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Forza Italia]] for a decade. In 2008, AN joined Forza Italia in Berlusconi's new party [[The People of Freedom]], but in 2012 a group of politicians split from The People of Freedom, refounding the party with the name [[Brothers of Italy]]. In Germany, various neo-Nazi movements have been formed and banned in accordance with Germany's constitutional law which forbids Nazism. The [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD) is widely considered a neo-Nazi party, although the party does not publicly identify itself as such.

[[File:Golden Dawn demonstration 1.jpg|thumb|right|Golden Dawn demonstration in Greece in 2012]]
After the onset of the [[Great Recession]] and economic crisis in Greece, a movement known as the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]], widely considered a neo-Nazi party, soared in support out of obscurity and won seats in [[Greece]]'s parliament, espousing a staunch hostility towards minorities, illegal immigrants and refugees. In 2013, after the murder of an anti-fascist musician by a person with links to Golden Dawn, the Greek government ordered the arrest of Golden Dawn's leader [[Nikolaos Michaloliakos]] and other Golden Dawn members on charges related to being associated with a criminal organization.

==Tenets==
[[Robert O. Paxton]] finds that the transformations undertaken by fascists in power were "profound enough to be called 'revolutionary.'" They "often set fascists into conflict with conservatives rooted in families, churches, social rank, and property." Paxton argues: &lt;blockquote&gt;[F]ascism redrew the frontiers between private and public, sharply diminishing what had once been untouchably private. It changed the practice of citizenship from the enjoyment of constitutional rights and duties to participation in mass ceremonies of affirmation and conformity. It reconfigured relations between the individual and the collectivity, so that an individual had no rights outside community interest. It expanded the powers of the executive—party and state—in a bid for total control. Finally, it unleashed aggressive emotions hitherto known in Europe only during war or social revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert O. Paxton|Paxton, Robert O.]] (2004) ''The Anatomy Of Fascism''. New York: Knopf. p.11. {{isbn|9781400040940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nationalism===
{{Nationalism sidebar |Types}}
[[Ultranationalism]] combined with the myth of national rebirth is a key foundation of fascism.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. pp. 451-453"&gt;Roger Griffin, "Nationalism" in  Cyprian Blamires, ed., ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia'', vol. 2 (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2006), pp. 451–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan Riley argues that in Italy in the early 1920s: &lt;blockquote&gt;Neither organized socialism nor the Italian liberals championed the democratic demands of the left nationalists. Fascism stepped into this vacuum, constituting itself as an antisocialist and antiliberal civil society movement. It was the failure of this counterhegemonic movement that would lead to the fascist seizure of power. Veterans' organizations are the clearest manifestation of civic mobilization in postwar Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Riley, Dylan|title=The Civic Foundations of Fascism in Europe: Italy, Spain, and Romania, 1870–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lc_KTSUOQPkC&amp;pg=PA42|year=2010|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=9780801894275|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fascist view of a nation is of a single organic entity that binds people together by their ancestry and is a natural unifying force of people.&lt;ref name="nationalism56" /&gt; Fascism seeks to solve economic, political and social problems by achieving a [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] national rebirth, exalting the nation or [[race (biology)|race]] above all else and promoting cults of unity, strength and purity.&lt;ref name="anatomnyfascismo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Passmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natureoffascismo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="walterlaq" /&gt;&lt;ref name="britannicafasc" /&gt; European fascist movements typically espouse a [[racism|racist]] conception of non-Europeans being inferior to Europeans.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995, p. 11"&gt;Payne, Stanley G., ''A History of Fascism, 1914–1945''. (Routledge, 1995, 2005), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this, fascists in Europe have not held a unified set of racial views.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995, p. 11"/&gt; Historically, most fascists promoted [[imperialism]], although there have been several fascist movements that were uninterested in the pursuit of new imperial ambitions.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995, p. 11"/&gt;

===Totalitarianism===
Fascism promotes the establishment of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin. ''Fascism, Totalitarianism, and Political Religion''. Routledge. pp. 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt; It opposes [[liberal democracy]], rejects multi-party systems and supports a [[one-party state]]. The ''[[Doctrine of Fascism]]'' states: "The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State—a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values—interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people".&lt;ref name="institutions" /&gt; In ''The Legal Basis of the Total State'', Nazi political theorist [[Carl Schmitt]] described the Nazi intention to form a "strong state which guarantees a totality of political unity transcending all diversity" in order to avoid a "disastrous pluralism tearing the German people apart".&lt;ref name="schmitt" /&gt;

Fascist states pursued policies of social [[indoctrination]] through [[propaganda]] in education and the media and regulation of the production of educational and media materials.&lt;ref name="totalitarianism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="google68" /&gt; Education was designed to glorify the fascist movement and inform students of its historical and political importance to the nation. It attempted to purge ideas that were not consistent with the beliefs of the fascist movement and to teach students to be obedient to the state.&lt;ref name="pauley" /&gt;

Fascism presented itself as a [[third position]],{{when|date=June 2017}} alternative to both [[Socialism|international socialism]] and [[Free market|free market capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Steve Bastow, James Martin. Third Way Discourse: European Ideologies in the Twentieth Century. Edinburgh University Press Ltd, 2003. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; While fascism opposed mainstream socialism, it sometimes regarded itself as a type of nationalist "socialism" to highlight their commitment to national [[solidarity]] and unity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyguide.org/europe/duce.html Benito Mussolini, Doctrine of Fascism (1932).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blamires1"&gt;Blamires, Cyprian, World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc, 2006) p. 610.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascists opposed international free market capitalism, but supported a type of productive capitalism.&lt;ref name=CritTheory&gt;{{cite book |last=Held |first=David |date=13 October 1980 |title=Introduction to Critical Theory: Horkheimer to Habermas |url= |location= |publisher=University of California Press |page= |isbn=978-0520041752 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alberto Spektorowski 2013"&gt;Alberto Spektorowski, Liza Ireni-Saban. ''Politics of Eugenics: Productionism, Population, and National Welfare''. Routledge, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic self-sufficiency, known as [[autarky]], was a major goal of most fascist governments.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. De Grand, ''Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany'', Routledge, 1995. pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Fascist governments advocated resolution of domestic [[class conflict]] within a nation in order to secure national solidarity.&lt;ref name="Griffin, Roger 1991 pp. 222-223"/&gt; This would be done through the state mediating relations between the classes (contrary to the views of [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]]-inspired capitalists).&lt;ref&gt;Calvin B. Hoover, ''The Paths of Economic Change: Contrasting Tendencies in the Modern World'', The American Economic Review, Vol. 25, No. 1, Supplement, Papers and Proceedings of the Forty-seventh Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association. (March 1935), pp. 13–20.&lt;/ref&gt; While fascism was opposed to domestic class conflict, it was held that bourgeois-proletarian conflict existed primarily in national conflict between [[proletarian nation]]s versus [[bourgeois nation]]s.&lt;ref name="minneapolis" /&gt; Fascism condemned what it viewed as widespread character traits that it associated as the typical bourgeois mentality that it opposed, such as materialism, crassness, cowardice, inability to comprehend the heroic ideal of the fascist "warrior"; and associations with liberalism, individualism and parliamentarianism.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. p. 102"&gt;Cyprian Blamires. ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1''. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2006. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, Mussolini defined what he viewed as the proletarian character, defining proletarian as being one and the same with producers, a [[Productivism|productivist]] perspective that associated all people deemed productive, including entrepreneurs, technicians, workers and soldiers as being proletarian.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Marco Piraino, Stefano Fiorito. Fascist Identity. pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged the historical existence of both bourgeois and proletarian producers, but declared the need for bourgeois producers to merge with proletarian producers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While fascism denounced the mainstream internationalist and Marxist socialisms, it claimed to economically represent a type of nationalist productivist socialism that while condemning parasitical capitalism, it was willing to accommodate productivist capitalism within it.&lt;ref name="Alberto Spektorowski 2013"/&gt; This was derived from [[Henri de Saint Simon]], whose ideas inspired the creation of [[utopian socialism]] and influenced other ideologies, that stressed solidarity rather than class war and whose conception of productive people in the economy included both productive workers and productive bosses to challenge the influence of the aristocracy and unproductive financial speculators.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. p. 535"&gt;Cyprian Blamires. ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1''. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2006. p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Simon's vision combined the traditionalist right-wing criticisms of the French Revolution combined with a left-wing belief in the need for association or collaboration of productive people in society.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. p. 535"/&gt; Whereas Marxism condemned capitalism as a system of exploitative property relations, fascism saw the nature of the control of credit and money in the contemporary capitalist system as abusive.&lt;ref name="Alberto Spektorowski 2013"/&gt; Unlike Marxism, fascism did not see class conflict between the Marxist-defined proletariat and the bourgeoisie as a given or as an engine of historical materialism.&lt;ref name="Alberto Spektorowski 2013"/&gt; Instead, it viewed workers and productive capitalists in common as productive people who were in conflict with parasitic elements in society including: corrupt political parties, corrupt financial capital and feeble people.&lt;ref name="Alberto Spektorowski 2013"/&gt; Fascist leaders such as Mussolini and Hitler spoke of the need to create a new managerial elite led by engineers and captains of industry—but free from the parasitic leadership of industries.&lt;ref name="Alberto Spektorowski 2013"/&gt; Hitler stated that the Nazi Party supported ''bodenständigen Kapitalismus'' ("productive capitalism") that was based upon profit earned from one's own labour, but condemned unproductive capitalism or loan capitalism, which derived profit from speculation.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan C. Friedman. The Routledge History of the Holocaust. Routledge, 2011. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fascist economics supported a state-controlled economy that accepted a mix of [[private ownership|private]] and [[public ownership]] over the [[means of production]].&lt;ref name="Robert Millward 1990. p. 178"&gt;Robert Millward. Private and public enterprise in Europe: energy, telecommunications and transport, 1830–1990. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic planning]] was applied to both the public and private sector and the prosperity of private enterprise depended on its acceptance of synchronizing itself with the economic goals of the state.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. p. 189"&gt;Cyprian Blamires. ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1''. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2006. p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist economic ideology supported the [[profit motive]], but emphasized that industries must uphold the national interest as superior to private profit.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. p. 189"/&gt;

While fascism accepted the importance of material wealth and power, it condemned materialism which identified as being present in both [[communism]] and [[capitalism]] and criticized materialism for lacking acknowledgement of the role of the [[spirit]].&lt;ref name="Peter Davies 2002. p. 103"&gt;Peter Davies, Derek Lynch. The Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right. Routledge, 2002. p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, fascists criticized capitalism not because of its competitive nature nor support of private property, which fascists supported—but due to its materialism, individualism, alleged bourgeois decadence and alleged indifference to the nation.&lt;ref name="Robert O. Paxton 2005. p. 10"&gt;Robert O. Paxton. ''The Anatomy of Fascism''. Vintage Books edition. Vintage Books, 2005. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism denounced Marxism for its advocacy of materialist internationalist class identity, which fascists regarded as an attack upon the emotional and spiritual bonds of the nation and a threat to the achievement of genuine national solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;John Breuilly. Nationalism and the State. University of Chicago Press edition. University of Chicago, 1994. p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing the spread of fascism beyond Italy, historian Philip Morgan states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the Depression was a crisis of laissez-faire capitalism and its political counterpart, parliamentary democracy, fascism could pose as the 'third-way' alternative between capitalism and Bolshevism, the model of a new European 'civilization'. As Mussolini typically put it in early 1934, "from 1929...fascism has become a universal phenomenon... The dominant forces of the 19th century, democracy, socialism, liberalism have been exhausted...the new political and economic forms of the twentieth-century are fascist'(Mussolini 1935: 32).&lt;ref name="Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fascists criticized [[egalitarianism]] as preserving the weak, and they instead promoted social Darwinist views and policies.&lt;ref name="egalitarianism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="university101" /&gt; They were in principle opposed to the idea of [[social welfare]], arguing that it "encouraged the preservation of the degenerate and the feeble."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939'', New York: NY, The Penguin Press, 2005, p. 483-484&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazi Party condemned the welfare system of the Weimar Republic, as well as private charity and philanthropy, for supporting people whom they regarded as racially inferior and weak, and who should have been weeded out in the process of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939'', New York: NY, The Penguin Press, 2005, p. 484&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, faced with the mass unemployment and poverty of the [[Great Depression]], the Nazis found it necessary to set up charitable institutions to help racially-pure Germans in order to maintain popular support, while arguing that this represented "racial self-help" and not indiscriminate charity or universal social welfare.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939'', New York: NY, The Penguin Press, 2005, p. 484-485&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Nazi programs such as the [[Winterhilfswerk|Winter Relief of the German People]] and the broader [[Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt|National Socialist People's Welfare]] (NSV) were organized as quasi-private institutions, officially relying on private donations from Germans to help others of their race - although in practice those who refused to donate could face severe consequences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939'', New York: NY, The Penguin Press, 2005, p. 486-487&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the social welfare institutions of the Weimar Republic and the Christian charities, the NSV distributed assistance on explicitly racial grounds. It provided support only to those who were "racially sound, capable of and willing to work, politically reliable, and willing and able to reproduce." Non-Aryans were excluded, as well as the "work-shy", "asocials" and the "hereditarily ill."&lt;ref name="Richard J 2005, p. 489"&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939'', New York: NY, The Penguin Press, 2005, p. 489&lt;/ref&gt; Under these conditions, by 1939, over 17 million Germans had obtained assistance from the NSV, and the agency "projected a powerful image of caring and support" for "those who were judged to have got into difficulties through no fault of their own."&lt;ref name="Richard J 2005, p. 489"/&gt; Yet the organization was "feared and disliked among society's poorest" because it resorted to intrusive questioning and monitoring to judge who was worthy of support.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939'', New York: NY, The Penguin Press, 2005, p. 489-490&lt;/ref&gt;

===Action===
Fascism emphasizes [[direct action]], including supporting the legitimacy of [[political violence]], as a core part of its politics.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1945. p. 106"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Breuilly. Nationalism and the State. p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism views violent action as a necessity in politics that fascism identifies as being an "endless struggle".&lt;ref name="Political Theory 2010. p. 106"&gt;Fascism and Political Theory: Critical Perspectives on Fascist Ideology. Routledge. Oxon, England; New York, New York: Routledge, 2010. p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasis on the use of political violence means that most fascist parties have also created their own private [[militias]] (e.g. the Nazi Party's [[Brown shirts]] and Fascist Italy's [[Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale|Blackshirts]]).

The basis of fascism's support of violent action in politics is connected to social Darwinism.&lt;ref name="Political Theory 2010. p. 106"/&gt; Fascist movements have commonly held social Darwinist views of nations, races and societies.&lt;ref name="psg485" /&gt; They say that nations and races must purge themselves of socially and biologically weak or [[Degeneration|degenerate]] people, while simultaneously promoting the creation of strong people, in order to survive in a world defined by perpetual national and racial conflict.&lt;ref name="university64" /&gt;

===Age and gender roles===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-04517A, Potsdam, Mädchen in der Führerinnenschule.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[League of German Girls]], an organization for girls within the Nazi Party in Germany]]
Fascism emphasizes [[youth]] both in a physical sense of age and in a spiritual sense as related to virility and commitment to action.&lt;ref name="Mark Antliff 2007. p. 171"&gt;Mark Antliff. ''Avant-Garde Fascism: The Mobilization of Myth, Art, and Culture in France, 1909–1939''. Duke University Press, 2007. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian Fascists' political anthem was called ''[[Giovinezza]]'' ("The Youth").&lt;ref name="Mark Antliff 2007. p. 171"/&gt; Fascism identifies the physical age period of youth as a critical time for the moral development of people who will affect society.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Sop Quine. ''Population Politics in Twentieth Century Europe: Fascist Dictatorships and Liberal Democracies''. Routledge, 1995. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Laqueur]] argues that:
:The corollaries of the cult of war and physical danger were the cult of brutality, strength, and sexuality....[fascism is] a true counter-civilization: rejecting the sophisticated rationalist humanism of Old Europe, fascism sets up as its ideal the primitive instincts and primal emotions of the barbarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Laqueur|title=Fascism: A Reader's Guide : Analyses, Interpretations, Bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2s8OaLD7y_oC&amp;pg=PA341|year=1978|publisher=U  of California Press|page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Fascism pursued what it called "moral hygiene" of youth, particularly regarding [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].&lt;ref name="Maria Sop Quine 1995. pp. 46-47"&gt;Maria Sop Quine. ''Population Politics in Twentieth Century Europe: Fascist Dictatorships and Liberal Democracies''. Routledge, 1995. pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist Italy promoted what it considered normal sexual behaviour in youth while denouncing what it considered deviant sexual behaviour.&lt;ref name="Maria Sop Quine 1995. pp. 46-47"/&gt; It condemned [[pornography]], most forms of [[birth control]] and contraceptive devices (with the exception of the [[condom]]), [[homosexuality]] and [[prostitution]] as deviant sexual behaviour, although enforcement of laws opposed to such practices was erratic and authorities often turned a blind eye.&lt;ref name="Maria Sop Quine 1995. pp. 46-47" /&gt; Fascist Italy regarded the promotion of male sexual excitation before [[puberty]] as the cause of criminality amongst male youth, declared homosexuality a social disease and pursued an aggressive campaign to reduce prostitution of young women.&lt;ref name="Maria Sop Quine 1995. pp. 46-47"/&gt;

Mussolini perceived women's primary role as primarily child bearers and men, warriors—once saying: "War is to man what maternity is to the woman".&lt;ref name="psychoanalysis" /&gt; In an effort to increase birthrates, the Italian Fascist government gave financial incentives to women who raised large families and initiated policies intended to reduce the number of women employed.&lt;ref name="mussolini73" /&gt; Italian Fascism called for women to be honoured as "reproducers of the nation" and the Italian Fascist government held ritual ceremonies to honour women's role within the Italian nation.&lt;ref name="university74" /&gt; In 1934, Mussolini declared that employment of women was a "major aspect of the thorny problem of unemployment" and that for women, working was "incompatible with childbearing". Mussolini went on to say that the solution to unemployment for men was the "exodus of women from the work force".&lt;ref name="routledge75" /&gt;

The German Nazi government strongly encouraged women to stay at home to bear children and keep house.&lt;ref name="evans76" /&gt; This policy was reinforced by bestowing the [[Cross of Honor of the German Mother]] on women bearing four or more children. The unemployment rate was cut substantially, mostly through arms production and sending women home so that men could take their jobs. Nazi propaganda sometimes promoted premarital and extramarital sexual relations, unwed motherhood and divorce, but at other times the Nazis opposed such behaviour.&lt;ref name="msu" /&gt;

The Nazis decriminalized abortion in cases where fetuses had hereditary defects or were of a race the government disapproved of, while the abortion of healthy pure German, [[Aryan race|Aryan]] fetuses remained strictly forbidden.&lt;ref name="The origins of Nazi genocide: from euthanasia to the final solution" /&gt; For non-Aryans, abortion was often compulsory. Their [[eugenics]] program also stemmed from the "progressive biomedical model" of [[Weimar Germany]].&lt;ref name="publishing" /&gt; In 1935, Nazi Germany expanded the legality of [[history of abortion|abortion]] by amending [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring|its eugenics law]], to promote abortion for women with hereditary disorders.&lt;ref name="The origins of Nazi genocide: from euthanasia to the final solution"/&gt; The law allowed abortion if a woman gave her permission and the fetus was not yet viable&lt;ref name="Racial Hygiene: Medicine Under the Nazis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gender and Crime in Modern Europe" /&gt; and for purposes of so-called [[racial hygiene]].&lt;ref name="Racial Hygiene: Medicine Under the Nazis71" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Women's studies encyclopedia" /&gt;

The Nazis said that homosexuality was degenerate, effeminate, perverted and undermined masculinity because it did not produce children.&lt;ref name="evans78" /&gt; They considered homosexuality curable through therapy, citing modern [[scientism]] and the study of [[sexology]], which said that homosexuality could be felt by "normal" people and not just an abnormal minority.&lt;ref name="fascism79" /&gt; Open homosexuals were interned in Nazi concentration camps.&lt;ref name="Persecution of Homosexuals in the Third Reich" /&gt;

===Palingenesis and modernism===
Fascism emphasizes both [[palingenesis]] (national rebirth or re-creation) and [[modernism]].&lt;ref name="Blamires168"&gt;Cyprian Blamires. ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1''. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2006 p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, fascism's nationalism has been identified as having a palingenetic character.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. pp. 451-453" /&gt; Fascism promotes the regeneration of the nation and purging it of [[decadence]].&lt;ref name="Blamires168" /&gt; Fascism accepts forms of modernism that it deems promotes national regeneration while rejecting forms of modernism that are regarded as antithetical to national regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian Blamires. ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1''. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2006 pp. 168–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism aestheticized modern technology and its association with speed, power and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Neocleous. ''Fascism''. [[University of Minnesota Press]], 1997. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism admired advances in the economy in the early 20th century, particularly [[Fordism]] and [[scientific management]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Neocleous. ''Fascism''. University of Minnesota Press, 1997. p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist modernism has been recognized as inspired or developed by various figures—such as [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], [[Ernst Jünger]], [[Gottfried Benn]], [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], [[Knut Hamsun]], [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Wyndham Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;"Fascist Modernism" by Jobst Welge. Astradur Eysteinsson (ed.), Vivian Liska (ed.). ''Modernism, Volumes 1–2''. John Benjamins Publishing, 2007. p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, such modernist influence was exemplified by Marinetti who advocated a palingenetic modernist society that condemned liberal-bourgeois values of tradition and psychology, while promoting a technological-martial religion of national renewal that emphasized militant nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;"Fascist Modernism" by Jobst Welge. Astradur Eysteinsson (ed.), Vivian Liska (ed.). ''Modernism, Volumes 1–2''. John Benjamins Publishing, 2007. p. 550.&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, it was exemplified by Jünger who was influenced by his observation of the technological warfare during World War I and claimed that a new social class had been created that he described as the "warrior-worker".&lt;ref name="jobstwelge"&gt;"Fascist Modernism" by Jobst Welge. Astradur Eysteinsson (ed.), Vivian Liska (ed.). ''Modernism, Volumes 1–2''. John Benjamins Publishing, 2007. p. 553.&lt;/ref&gt; Jünger like Marinetti emphasized the revolutionary capacities of technology and emphasized an "organic construction" between human and machine as a liberating and regenerative force in that challenged liberal democracy, conceptions of individual autonomy, bourgeois nihilism and decadence.&lt;ref name="jobstwelge" /&gt; He conceived of a society based on a totalitarian concept of "total mobilization" of such disciplined warrior-workers.&lt;ref name="jobstwelge" /&gt;
&lt;!-- commenting out as this section needs to be reorganized into the article===Economic policies===
{{Further|Economics of fascism}}

According to Bruce Pauley, Fascist governments exercised control over private property but did not nationalize it.&lt;ref name="pauley83"/&gt; According to Patricia Knight, they did, with the Italian Fascist government coming to own the highest percentage of industries outside the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="mussolini84"/&gt; The Nazis also nationalized some business.&lt;ref name="guillebaud"/&gt; In fact, the "Twenty-Five Point Programme" of the Nazi party, adopted in 1920, demanded "the nationalization of all businesses which have been formed into corporations."&lt;ref name="heinemann"/&gt; Other scholars noted that big business developed an increasingly close partnership with the Nazi and Fascist governments as it became increasingly organized. Business leaders supported the government's political and military goals, and in exchange, the government pursued economic policies that maximized the profits of its business allies.&lt;ref name="bloomington"/&gt; Nazi Germany transferred public ownership and public services into the private sector, while other Western capitalist countries strove for increased state ownership of industry.&lt;ref name="www"/&gt; In his book, ''Big Business in the Third Reich'', Arthur Schweitzer notes that, "Monopolistic price fixing became the rule in most industries, and cartels were no longer confined to the heavy or large-scale industries.&amp;nbsp;... Cartels and quasi-cartels (whether of big business or small) set prices, engaged in limiting production, and agreed to divide markets and classify consumers in order to realize a monopoly profit.&lt;ref name="bloomington85"/&gt;

Fascists pursued economic policies to strengthen state power and spread ideology, such as consolidating trade unions and putting them under state or party control.&lt;ref name="pauley86"/&gt; Attempts were made by both Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany to establish "[[autarky]]" (self-sufficiency) through significant economic planning, but neither achieved economic self-sufficiency.&lt;ref name="pauley87"/&gt;

====National corporatism, statism and national syndicalism====
Italian Fascism's economy was based on [[corporatism]], and a number of other fascist movements similarly promoted corporatism. [[Oswald Mosley]] of the [[British Union of Fascists]], describing fascist corporatism, said that "it means a nation organized as the human body, with each organ performing its individual function but working in harmony with the whole".&lt;ref name="re208"/&gt; Fascists were not hostile to the ''[[petit-bourgeoisie]]'' or to small businesses, and they promised these groups, alongside the proletariat, protection from the upper-class bourgeoisie, big business, and Marxism. The promotion of these groups is the source of the term "extremism of the centre" to describe fascism.&lt;ref name="gr101"/&gt;

Fascism blamed capitalist [[liberal democracies]] for creating class conflict and communists for exploiting it.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; In Italy, the Fascist period presided over the creation of the largest number of state-owned enterprises in [[Western Europe]], such as the nationalisation of [[petroleum]] companies into a single state enterprise called the Italian General Agency for Petroleum (''Azienda Generale Italiani Petroli'', AGIP).&lt;ref name="publishing88"/&gt; Fascists made populist appeals to the [[middle class]], especially the lower middle class, by promising to protect small businesses and property owners from communism, and by promising an economy based on competition and profit while pledging to oppose big business.&lt;ref name=gr101/&gt;

In 1933, Benito Mussolini declared Italian Fascism's opposition to the "decadent capitalism" that he claimed prevailed in the world at the time, but he did not denounce capitalism entirely. Mussolini claimed that capitalism had degenerated in three stages, starting with dynamic or [[Heroic capitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|heroic capitalism]] (1830–1870), followed by static capitalism (1870–1914), and reaching its final form of decadent capitalism or "[[Supercapitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|supercapitalism]]" beginning in 1914.&lt;ref name="fz136"/&gt; Mussolini said that Italian Fascism acknowledged the positive achievements of dynamic and heroic capitalism for its contribution to [[industrialism]] and its technical developments, but that it did not favor supercapitalism, which he claimed was incompatible with Italy's agricultural sector.&lt;ref name=fz136/&gt;

Thus Mussolini claimed that Italy under Fascist rule was not capitalist in the contemporary use of the term, which referred to supercapitalism.&lt;ref name=fz136/&gt; Mussolini denounced supercapitalism for causing the "standardization of humankind" and for causing excessive consumption.&lt;ref name="aesthetics89"/&gt; Mussolini claimed that at the stage of supercapitalism, "a capitalist enterprise, when difficulties arise, throws itself like a dead weight into the state's arms. It is then that state intervention begins and becomes more necessary. It is then that those who once ignored the state now seek it out anxiously."&lt;ref name="establishing"/&gt; He saw Fascism as the next logical step to solve the problems of supercapitalism and claimed that "our path would lead inexorably into [[state capitalism]], which is nothing more nor less than [[state socialism]] turned on its head. In either event, the result is the bureaucratization of the economic activities of the nation."&lt;ref name="mb158-159"/&gt; Mussolini claimed that dynamic or heroic capitalism and the [[bourgeoisie]] could be prevented from degenerating into static capitalism and then supercapitalism if the concept of economic [[individualism]] were abandoned and if state supervision of the economy was introduced.&lt;ref name="salvemini"/&gt; [[Private enterprise]] would control production but it would be supervised by the state.&lt;ref name="Salvemini. p. 134"/&gt; By the late 1930s and the 1940s, Italian Fascism completely denounced capitalism as an obsolete and oppressive system, Mussolini in 1940 at the entry of Italy into World War II, said:
{{quote|''This conflict must not be allowed to cancel out all our achievements of the past eighteen years, nor, more importantly, extinguish the hope of a Third Alternative held out by Fascism to mankind fettered between the pillar of capitalist slavery and the post of Marxist chaos. The proponents of these obsolete doctrines must understand that the Fascist sword has been unsheathed twice before, in Ethiopia and in Spain, with known results.''|Benito Mussolini, 1940.&lt;ref name="mediterranean"/&gt;}}

Italian Fascism presented the economic system of [[corporatism]] as the solution that would preserve private enterprise and property while allowing the state to intervene in the economy when private enterprise failed.&lt;ref name="Salvemini. p. 134"/&gt;

Other fascist regimes were indifferent or hostile to corporatism. The Nazis initially attempted to form a corporatist economic system like that of Fascist Italy, creating the National Socialist Institute for Corporatism in May 1933, which included many major economists who said that corporatism was consistent with National Socialism.&lt;ref name="minneapolis90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="routledge91"/&gt; In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler spoke enthusiastically about the "National Socialist corporative idea" as one that eventually would "take the place of ruinous class warfare".&lt;ref name="aristotle92"/&gt; The Nazis later came to view corporatism as detrimental to Germany and institutionalizing and legitimizing social differences within the German nation. Instead, the Nazis began to promote economic organization that emphasized the biological unity of the German national community.&lt;ref name="minneapolis93"/&gt;

Hitler continued to refer to corporatism in propaganda, but it was not put into place, even though a number of Nazi officials such as [[Walther Darré]], [[Gottfried Feder]], [[Alfred Rosenburg]], and [[Gregor Strasser]] were in favor of a [[Neo-medievalism|neo-medievalist]] form of corporatism, since corporations had been influential in German history in the [[medieval]] era.&lt;ref name="ideologies"/&gt;

Spanish Falangist leader José Antonio Primo de Rivera did not believe that corporatism was effective and denounced it as a propaganda ploy, saying "this stuff about the corporative state is another piece of windbaggery".&lt;ref name="ideologies94"/&gt;

====Economic planning====
Fascists opposed the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies that were dominant in the era prior to the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="political"/&gt; After the Great Depression began, many people from across the [[political spectrum]] blamed ''laissez-faire'' capitalism, and fascists promoted their ideology as a "[[Third Position|third way]]" between capitalism and [[communism]].&lt;ref name=pm168/&gt;

Fascists declared their opposition to [[finance capitalism]], [[interest]] charging, and profiteering.&lt;ref name="university95"/&gt; [[Nazism|Nazis]] and other antisemitic fascists considered finance capitalism a "[[Parasitism|parasitic]]" "[[antisemitism|Jewish conspiracy]]".&lt;ref name="socialism"/&gt; Fascist governments introduced [[Incomes policy|price controls]], wage controls and other types of [[Economic interventionism|economic interventionist]] measures.&lt;ref name="Andreski-p64"/&gt;

Fascists thought that private property should be regulated to ensure that "benefit to the community precedes benefit to the individual."&lt;ref name="reconciling"/&gt; Private [[property]] rights were supported but were contingent upon service to the state.&lt;ref name="neofascism"/&gt; For example, "an owner of agricultural land may be compelled to raise wheat instead of sheep and employ more labour than he would find profitable."&lt;ref name="comparative96"/&gt; They promoted the interests of successful small businesses.&lt;ref name="fascist"/&gt; Mussolini wrote approvingly of the notion that profits should not be taken away from those who produced them by their own labour, saying "I do not respect—I even hate—those men that leech a tenth of the riches produced by others".&lt;ref name="mussolini97"/&gt;

According to historian Tibor Ivan Berend, "[[dirigisme]]" was an inherent aspect of fascist economies.&lt;ref name="university98"/&gt; The [[Labour Charter of 1927]], promulgated by the [[Grand Council of Fascism]], stated in article 7: "The corporative State considers private initiative, in the field of production, as the most efficient and useful instrument of the Nation", then continued in article 9: "State intervention in economic production may take place only where private initiative is lacking or is insufficient, or when are at stakes the political interest of the State. This intervention may take the form of control, encouragement or direct management."&lt;ref name="corporativo"/&gt; --&gt;

==Criticism==
Fascism has been widely criticized and condemned in modern times since the defeat of the Axis Powers in World War II.

===Anti-democratic and tyrannical===
{{further|Anti-democratic thought}}

[[File:Hitler and Franco at Hendaye.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Hitler and Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] in [[Meeting at Hendaye]], on 23 October 1940]]
One of the most common and strongest criticisms of fascism is that it is a [[tyranny]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Boesche]]. Theories of Tyranny, from Plato to Arendt. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism is deliberately and entirely non-democratic and anti-democratic.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Barry Clarke, Joe Foweraker. ''Encyclopedia of Democratic Thought''. Routledge, 2001. p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Pollard. The Fascist Experience in Italy. Routledge, 1998. p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin. ''The Nature of Fascism''. New York, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1991. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unprincipled opportunism===
Some critics of Italian fascism have said that much of the ideology was merely a by-product of unprincipled [[opportunism]] by Mussolini and that he changed his political stances merely to bolster his personal ambitions while he disguised them as being purposeful to the public.&lt;ref name="Gerhard Schreiber 1995. p. 111"&gt;[[Gerhard Schreiber]], [[Bernd Stegemann]], [[Detlef Vogel]]. ''Germany and the Second World War: Volume III: The Mediterranean, South-East Europe, and North Africa 1939–1941 (From Italy's Declaration of Non-Belligerence to the Entry of the United States into the War)'' (Oxford University Press, 1995) p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Washburn Child]], the American ambassador to Italy who worked with Mussolini and became his friend and admirer, defended Mussolini's opportunistic behaviour by writing: "Opportunist is a term of reproach used to brand men who fit themselves to conditions for the reasons of self-interest. Mussolini, as I have learned to know him, is an opportunist in the sense that he believed that mankind itself must be fitted to changing conditions rather than to fixed theories, no matter how many hopes and prayers have been expended on theories and programmes".&lt;ref name="Benito Mussolini 1998"&gt;Mussolini, Benito, ''My Rise And Fall, Volumes 1–2''. Da Capo Press ed. (Da Capo Press, 1998) p. ix. (Note: Mussolini wrote the second volume about his fall from power as head of government of the Kingdom of Italy in 1943, though he was restored to power in northern Italy by the German military.)&lt;/ref&gt; Child quoted Mussolini as saying: "The sanctity of an ism is not in the ism; it has no sanctity beyond its power to do, to work, to succeed in practice. It may have succeeded yesterday and fail to-morrow. Failed yesterday and succeed to-morrow. The machine first of all must run!".&lt;ref name="Benito Mussolini 1998"/&gt;

Some have criticized Mussolini's actions during the outbreak of [[World War I]] as opportunist for seeming to suddenly abandon Marxist [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] for non-egalitarian [[nationalism]] and note to that effect that upon Mussolini endorsing Italy's intervention in the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary, he and the new fascist movement received financial support from foreign sources, such as [[Italian Ansaldo company|Ansaldo]] (an armaments firm) and other companies&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Dennis Mack,''Modern Italy; A Political History''. (Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1997) p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the British Security Service [[MI5]].&lt;ref name="Guardian2009-10-13"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/13/benito-mussolini-recruited-mi5-italy |work=Guardian |location=UK |title=Recruited by MI5: the name's Mussolini. Benito Mussolini&amp;nbsp;– Documents reveal Italian dictator got start in politics in 1917 with help of £100 weekly wage from MI5 |date=13 October 2009 |accessdate=14 October 2009 |first=Tom |last=Kington}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, including Mussolini's socialist opponents at the time, have noted that regardless of the financial support he accepted for his pro-interventionist stance, Mussolini was free to write whatever he wished in his newspaper ''Il Popolo d'Italia'' without prior sanctioning from his financial backers.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Paul, ''Mussolini in the First World War: The Journalist, The Soldier, The Fascist'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the major source of financial support that Mussolini and the fascist movement received in World War I was from France and is widely believed to have been French socialists who supported the French government's war against Germany and who sent support to Italian socialists who wanted Italian intervention on France's side.&lt;ref name="Gregor-1979-p-200"&gt;Gregor 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mussolini's transformation away from Marxism into what eventually became fascism began prior to World War I, as Mussolini had grown increasingly pessimistic about Marxism and egalitarianism while becoming increasingly supportive of figures who opposed egalitarianism, such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref name="Golomb-Wistrich-2002-p-249"&gt;Golomb &amp; Wistrich 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;249.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1902, Mussolini was studying [[Georges Sorel]], Nietzsche and [[Vilfredo Pareto]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Delzel, Charles F., ed. ''Mediterranean Fascism 1919–1945'' (Harper Rowe, 1970) p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Sorel's emphasis on the need for overthrowing decadent [[liberal democracy]] and [[capitalism]] by the use of violence, [[direct action]], [[general strike]]s and [[Machiavellianism|neo-Machiavellian]] appeals to emotion impressed Mussolini deeply.&lt;ref name="Mediterranean3"&gt;Delzel, Charles F., ed. ''Mediterranean Fascism 1919–1945'' (Harper Rowe, 1970) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini's use of Nietzsche made him a highly unorthodox socialist, due to Nietzsche's promotion of elitism and anti-egalitarian views.&lt;ref name="Golomb-Wistrich-2002-p-249"/&gt; Prior to World War I, Mussolini's writings over time indicated that he had abandoned the Marxism and egalitarianism that he had previously supported in favour of Nietzsche's ''übermensch'' concept and anti-egalitarianism.&lt;ref name="Golomb-Wistrich-2002-p-249"/&gt; In 1908, Mussolini wrote a short essay called "Philosophy of Strength" based on his Nietzschean influence, in which Mussolini openly spoke fondly of the ramifications of an impending war in Europe in challenging both religion and [[nihilism]]: "[A] new kind of free spirit will come, strengthened by the war, ... a spirit equipped with a kind of sublime perversity, ... a new free spirit will triumph over God and over Nothing".&lt;ref name="Gigliola Gori 2004. p. 14"/&gt;

===Ideological dishonesty===
Fascism has been criticized for being ideologically dishonest. Major examples of ideological dishonesty have been identified in Italian fascism's changing relationship with German Nazism.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. p. 17"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England; New York, New York: Routledge, 2001. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Pollard 1998. p. 129"&gt;John Pollard. The Fascist Experience in Italy. Routledge, 1998. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist Italy's official foreign policy positions were known to commonly utilize rhetorical ideological [[hyperbole]] to justify its actions, although during Dino Grandi's tenure as Italy's foreign minister the country engaged in ''[[realpolitik]]'' free of such fascist hyperbole.&lt;ref&gt;H. James Burgwyn. ''Italian Foreign Policy in the Interwar Period, 1918–1940''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian fascism's stance towards German Nazism fluctuated from support from the late 1920s to 1934, when it celebrated Hitler's rise to power and meeting with Hitler in 1934; to opposition from 1934 to 1936 after the assassination of Italy's allied leader in [[Austria]], [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], by Austrian Nazis; and again back to support after 1936, when Germany was the only significant power that did not denounce Italy's invasion and occupation of [[Ethiopia]].

After antagonism exploded between Nazi Germany and [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] over the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss in 1934, Mussolini and Italian fascists denounced and ridiculed Nazism's racial theories, particularly by denouncing its [[Nordic race|Nordicism]], while promoting [[Mediterraneanism]].&lt;ref name="John Pollard 1998. p. 129" /&gt; Mussolini himself responded to Nordicists' claims of Italy being divided into Nordic and Mediterranean racial areas due to Germanic invasions of Northern Italy by claiming that while Germanic tribes such as the [[Lombards]] took control of Italy after the fall of Ancient Rome, they arrived in small numbers (about 8,000) and quickly assimilated into Roman culture and spoke the [[Vulgar Latin|Latin]] language within fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England; New York, New York: Routledge, 2001. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian fascism was influenced by the tradition of Italian nationalists scornfully looking down upon Nordicists' claims and taking pride in comparing the age and sophistication of ancient Roman civilization as well as the classical revival in the [[Renaissance]] to that of Nordic societies that Italian nationalists described as "newcomers" to civilization in comparison.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. p. 17"/&gt; At the height of antagonism between the Nazis and Italian fascists over race, Mussolini claimed that the Germans themselves were not a pure race and noted with irony that the Nazi theory of German racial superiority was based on the theories of non-German foreigners, such as Frenchman [[Arthur de Gobineau]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillette, Aaron. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London, England; New York, New York: Routledge, 2002. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; After the tension in German-Italian relations diminished during the late 1930s, Italian fascism sought to harmonize its ideology with German Nazism and combined Nordicist and Mediterranean racial theories, noting that Italians were members of the Aryan Race, composed of a mixed Nordic-Mediterranean subtype.&lt;ref name="John Pollard 1998. p. 129"/&gt;

In 1938, Mussolini declared upon Italy's adoption of antisemitic laws that Italian fascism had always been antisemitic,&lt;ref name="John Pollard 1998. p. 129"/&gt; In fact, Italian fascism did not endorse [[antisemitism]] until the late 1930s when Mussolini feared alienating antisemitic Nazi Germany, whose power and influence were growing in Europe. Prior to that period there had been notable Jewish Italians who had been senior Italian fascist officials, including [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who had also been Mussolini's mistress.&lt;ref name="John Pollard 1998. p. 129"/&gt; Also contrary to Mussolini's claim in 1938, only a small number of Italian fascists were staunchly antisemitic (such as [[Roberto Farinacci]] and Giuseppe Preziosi), while others such as [[Italo Balbo]], who came from [[Ferrara]] which had one of Italy's largest Jewish communities, were disgusted by the antisemitic laws and opposed them.&lt;ref name="John Pollard 1998. p. 129"/&gt; Fascism scholar Mark Neocleous notes that while Italian fascism did not have a clear commitment to antisemitism, there were occasional antisemitic statements issued prior to 1938, such as Mussolini in 1919 declaring that the Jewish bankers in London and New York were connected by race to the Russian [[Bolshevik]]s and that eight percent of the Russian Bolsheviks were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Neocleous. ''Fascism''. Open University Press, 1997. pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Felix Weltsch.jpg|thumb|250px|Felix Weltsch]]
'''Felix Weltsch''' (6 October 1884, [[Prague]] &amp;ndash; 9 November 1964, [[Jerusalem]]), was a [[German language|German]]-speaking [[Jew]]ish librarian, philosopher, author, editor, publisher and journalist. A close friend of [[Max Brod]] and [[Franz Kafka]], he was one of the most important [[Zionism|Zionists]] in [[Bohemia]].

==Life==
Born in [[Prague]] (then in [[Austria-Hungary]]), Weltsch studied Law and Philosophy at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universität|Charles University]]. He lived and worked in Prague until 15 March 1939, and left the city with [[Max Brod]] and his family on the last train out of [[Czechoslovakia]]. In what at his arrival was [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and later the state of [[Israel]], he worked as a librarian in [[Jerusalem]] until his death in 1964.

He had one daughter, Ruth Weltsch (1920–1991), with his wife Irma Herz (1892–1969). They married in August 1914. The publisher, journalist and important Zionist [[Robert Weltsch]] was Felix Weltsch's cousin, and the Prague-born concert pianist [[Alice Herz-Sommer]], who performed in and survived [[Theresienstadt]] at her death the world's oldest Holocaust survivor, was his sister-in-law.

==Influence==
Weltsch's works around deal with the subjects of Ethics, Politics and Philosophy. For his ethical and political publications Weltsch received the Ruppin-Prize from the city of [[Haifa]] in 1952. His most important work was the Jewish-Zionist weekly paper ''Selbstwehr'' (self-defense), which he led from 1919 until 1938. With this work and hundreds of articles he became one of the most important personalities in Jewish life next to [[Martin Buber]], [[Chaim Weizmann]] and [[Hugo Bergmann]], his early school friend.

Weltsch wrote remarkable essays on philosophers like [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Christian von Ehrenfels]], who was the most influential teacher for Weltsch. This was in so far unusual, as most of Weltsch's colleagues and student friends were more following the ideas of [[Franz Brentano]]. But people like Bergman and [[Martin Buber]] called him a self-thinking, independent philosopher. His influence and help to many others was great, but his role as a cultural consultant is not known to many also due to his shyness. The friendship to Kafka lasted 20 years, and the friendship to [[Max Brod]] lasted 75 years from the Piarist school in Prague to Weltschs death in 1964.

Count '''Francesco Algarotti''' (11 December 1712 – 3 May 1764) was an Venetian [[polymath]], philosopher, poet, essayist, [[anglophile]], [[art critic]] and art collector. He was "one of the first Esprits cavaliers of the age,"{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} a man of broad knowledge, an expert in [[Newtonianism]], architecture and music and a friend of most of the leading authors of his times: [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens]], [[Pierre-Louis de Maupertuis]] and the atheist [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]]. [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]], [[Thomas Gray]], [[George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton|George Lyttelton]], [[Thomas Hollis (1720–1774)|Thomas Hollis]], [[Metastasio]], [[Benedict XIV]] and [[Heinrich von Brühl]] were among his correspondents.&lt;ref name="Eighteenth Century Bibliography"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eighteenth Century Bibliography|title=Francesco Algarotti Bibliography|url=http://www.c18th.com/author-works.aspx?id=175|publisher=C18.com|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Algarotti was born in [[Venice]] as the son of a rich merchant. His father and uncle were art collectors. Unlike his older brother Bonomo he did not step into the company, but decided to become an author. Francesco studied [[natural sciences]] and mathematics in [[Bologna]] under [[Francesco Maria Zanotti]] and in 1728 he experimented with [[optics]]. (Zanotti became a lifelong friend.) First he travelled in the North of Italy, but moved to Florence, and Rome. At the age of twenty, he went to [[Cirey]] and Paris, where he became friendly with Voltaire and [[Émilie du Châtelet]].&lt;ref&gt;In 1740 Voltaire called him the Venetian [[Socrates]], may be his "cher cygne de Padoue" ("dear swan of Padua").&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later he was in London, where he was made a fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. He became embroiled in a lively bisexual love-triangle with the politician [[John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey|John Hervey]], and [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]].&lt;ref&gt;Rictor Norton, "John, Lord Hervey: The Third Sex", The Great Queens of History. Updated 8 August 2009 [http://rictornorton.co.uk/hervey.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Algarotti left for Italy and finished his ''Neutonianismo per le dame'' ("Newtonism for Ladies") (1737 – dedicated to [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]]) – a work consisting of information on astronomy, physics, mathematics, women and science and education.

In the meantime Algarotti had made acquaintance with [[Antiochus Kantemir]], a Moldavian diplomat, poet and composer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=6sFHnfb89A8C&amp;lpg=PA335&amp;ots=2qIYE2tWJg&amp;dq=Algarotti%20Sint%20Petersburg%201739%20wedding&amp;pg=PA335#v=onepage&amp;q=Algarotti%20Sint%20Petersburg%201739%20wedding&amp;f=false  'By the Banks of the Neva': Chapters from the Lives and Careers of the ... By Anthony Glenn Cross]&lt;/ref&gt; He was invited to visit Russia for the wedding of [[Duke Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick]].&lt;ref&gt;Algarotti dedicated six of the letters that made up his ''Viaggi di Russia'' to John Hervey; the others to [[Scipio Maffei]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1739 he left with [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]] from [[Sheerness]] to [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Because of a heavy storm the ship sheltered in [[Harlingen, Friesland|Harlingen]]. Algarotti was discovering "this new city".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=Gg19b0fFbIIC&amp;lpg=PA228&amp;ots=9ZmO8-njsc&amp;dq=Algarotti%20Sint%20Petersburg%201737&amp;pg=PA228#v=onepage&amp;q=Algarotti%20Sint%20Petersburg%201737&amp;f=false  The Petrine Revolution in Russian Architecture By James Cracraft]&lt;/ref&gt; Returning from [[Saint Petersburg]], they visited [[Frederick the Great]] in [[Rheinsberg]]. Algarotti had obligations in England and came back the year after. Then Algarotti went together with Frederick to [[Königsberg]] where he was crowned.

[[File:The Chocolate Girl by Jean-Étienne Liotard.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Nandl Baldauf, la belle chocolatière (1743/44).

Frederick, who was impressed with this walking encyclopedia, made him and his brother Bonomo [[Prussia]]n counts in 1740. Algarotti accompanied Frederick to [[Bayreuth]], [[Kehl]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Moyland Castle]] where they met with Voltaire, who was taking baths in [[Kleve]] for his health.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonogh, G. (1999) Frederick the Great, p. 142-145.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1741 Algarotti went to [[Turin]] as his diplomat. Frederick had offered him a salary, but Algarotti refused. First, he went to [[Dresden]] and Venice, where he bought 21 paintings, a few by [[Jean-Étienne Liotard]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] for the court of [[Augustus III of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://legionofhonor.famsf.org/blog/framework-empire-flora-giovanni-battista-tiepolo The Empire of Flora by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo] at Legion of Honor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitage.nl/en/tentoonstellingen/venetie/schoonste_schijn.htm Eighteenth-century Venetian Art] at Hermitage Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt; Algarotti did not succeed to have the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] attack Austria in the back.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonogh, G.

===Algarotti and the other arts===

Algarotti's choice of works reflects the encyclopedic interests of the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassic era]]; he was uninterested in developing a single unitary stylistic collection, he envisioned a modern museum, a catalog of styles from across the ages. For contemporary commissions, he wrote up a list for paintings he recommended commissioning, including to ask of history paintings from [[Giambattista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], [[Giambattista Pittoni|Pittoni]], and [[Piazzetta]]; scenes with animals from [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione|Castiglione]], and [[veduta]] with ruins from [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini|Pannini]]. He wanted''"suggetti graziosi e leggeri"'' from [[Antonio Balestra|Balestra]], [[François Boucher|Boucher]], and [[Donato Creti]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K_zR2mHWPmoC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=Algarotti+Pannini+painting&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ufne9Ghfle&amp;sig=8ronE0K_ycR2H8TxhmicoQetwS4&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sz1BT6r-N4vs-gbe9YyDAQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Algarotti%20Pannini%20Pantheon&amp;f=false ''Tiepolo's Cleopatra Door'', by Jaynie Anderson, p. 109]&lt;/ref&gt; Other artist he protected were [[Giuseppe Nogari]], [[Bernardo Bellotto]], and [[Francesco Pavona]].

In 1747 Algarotti went back to Potsdam and became court chamberlain, but left to visit the archeological diggings at [[Herculaneum]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDonogh, G. (1999) Frederick the Great, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1749 he moved to Berlin. Algarotti was &lt;!--involved in the production of operas and--&gt; involved in finishing the architectural designs of [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]] who had fallen ill. In February 1753, after several years residing in Prussia, he returned to Italy, living most of the time in Bologna. In 1759 Algarotti was involved in a new opera-style in the city of [[Parma]]. He influencing [[Guillaume du Tillot]] and the [[Philip, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]].

[[File:Adolph-von-Menzel-Tafelrunde2.jpg|200px|rechts|thumb|Gathering on [[Sanssouci]] in the Marble Hall, with Fredrik II. (the Great) of Prussia, [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens|d'Argens]], [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie|La Mettrie]], [[James Francis Edward Keith|James Keith]], [[George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal|George Keith]], Friedrich Rudolf von Rothenburg, Christoph Ludwig von Stille, and Algarotti. The painting was lost in 1945]]

Algarotti's ''Essay on the Opera'' (1755) was a major influence on the librettist [[Carlo Innocenzo Frugoni]] and the composer [[Tommaso Traetta]], and in the development of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck's]] reformist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Orrey, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Algarotti proposed a heavily simplified model of ''opera seria'', with the drama pre-eminent, instead of the music, ballet or staging. The drama itself should "delight the eyes and ears, to rouse up and to affect the hearts of an audience, without the risk of sinning against reason or common sense". Algarotti's ideas influenced both Gluck and his librettist [[Calzabigi]], writing their [[Orfeo ed Euridice]].&lt;ref name="Orrey83"&gt;Orrey, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1762 Algarotti moved to [[Pisa]], where he died of tuberculosis. Frederick the Great, who several times needed Algarotti writing texts in Latin, sent in a text for a monument to his memory on the [[Camposanto Monumentale|Campo Santo]].

[[File:school-of-`Atenisi.jpg|thumb|400px|A collage of Futa Helu in [[The School of Athens]] made for his 70th birthday. Futa is here portrayed with [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].]]
'''Futa Helu''' (17 June 1934 – 2 February 2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atenisi.edu.to/latest/latest.html#mate |title=ʻIlaisa Futa-ʻi-Haʻangana Helu – 17 June 1934 – 2 February 2010 |work='Atenisi Institute |accessdate=3 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701033110/http://www.atenisi.edu.to/latest/latest.html#mate |archivedate=1 July 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Tongan philosopher, historian, and educator. He studied philosophy under the Australian empiricist [[John Anderson (philosopher)|John Anderson]] and in 1963 launched an educational institute named [[Atenisi Institute|&amp;lsquo;Atenisi]] (Tongan for [[Athens]], to pay homage to the ancient Greek philosophers, [[Heraclitus|Herakleitos]] in particular). The institute began as a continuing education programme for civil servants, then initiated a high school in 1964 and a university in 1975.

==Life==
Helu was born on 17 June 1934 in the village of [[Lotofoa]] on the island of [[Foa]] in the [[Ha'apai|Ha{{okina}}apai archipelago]] in the (Polynesian) [[Kingdom of Tonga]]. Helu, in fact, is a minor chiefly title, carrying the task of managing both the people and land of the village. In Ha{{okina}}apai, Futa was a bright, although headstrong, student. In 1947 he was selected to be part of the founding class of the newly established [[Tonga high school]] sited in Tonga's capital, the school being a project of a promising Crown Prince who would accede to the throne as [[Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV]] in 1967.

Helu studied in Australia at [[Newington College]] (1953–1956)&lt;ref&gt;Newington College Register of Past Students 1863–1998 (Syd, 1999) pp 86&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Sydney]] (1957–60). At Sydney he focused on philosophy, English literature, mathematics and physics. Back in Tonga in April 1961 he did not become – as one might have expected – a government bureaucrat, but held himself out as tutor to those having trouble keeping up at school. His way of teaching soon became famous, and many Tongans who are now important figures claim he instilled a love of learning that impelled their careers.

{{okina}}Atenisi Institute was initially a downtown night school providing continuing education for civil servants, evolving into a daytime secondary school in 1964. In 1966 Helu registered {{okina}}Atenisi's high school with the government and at the end of that year leased a {{convert|6.5|ha|acre|sing=on}} parcel in Tufuenga, a western district in the Tongan capital of [[Nukuʻalofa|Nuku{{okina}}alofa]]. The parcel is, in fact, below sea level and students often speak of the ''swampus'' instead of the ''campus''. At the end of 1975 a small university joined the high school on the site, its first bachelor of arts degrees being awarded in 1980, followed a few years later by bachelor of science degrees. By the 1990s, some Master of Arts degrees – and even a PhD degree – were awarded in collaboration with universities in Australia and New Zealand.

Dr. Helu not only administered his institute but – like [[Thomas Jefferson]] at the University of Virginia in early 19th century America – designed its classrooms, laboratories, and libraries, often in classical style. Whilst small contractors were, of course, employed in {{okina}}Atenisi's construction, in the early days its director was not above roofing a new building after class.

In 1992 Dr. Helu joined Tonga's [[Catholic]] bishop, [[Patelisio P. Fīnau]], and the former president of the [[Free Wesleyan Church]], Dr. [[Sione 'Amanaki Havea|Sione {{okina}}Amanaki Havea]], in sponsoring a conference advocating Tonga's transition from a feudal to parliamentary monarchy. Not only did the Government resist this call but it punished {{okina}}Atenisi for its advocacy by thenceforth refusing to employ its university graduates, a severe penalty in the developing world. The boycott was lifted after the accession of a commoner prime minister in 2006 and the Government's concession to democratic principle.

Until her death in April 2008, Dr. Helu was married to Kaloni Schaaf; the union produced six children and numerous grandchildren. Two daughters have distinguished themselves in the performing arts – [[Sisiʻuno Helu]], founder of {{okina}}Atenisi's performing arts troupe and orchestra, has staged Tongan [[faiva]] and spirited excerpts from Italian opera on tours of the Pacific, Europe, and the US; [[ʻAtolomake Helu|{{okina}}Atolomake Helu]] has sung soprano in noted international venues, such as Sydney and Auckland Town Halls. A son, [[Niulala Helu]], is a former lecturer in Tongan culture at the [[University of Auckland]].

Dr. Helu was the author of several books, most importantly two books on Tongan culture, a monograph on Herakleitos, and a collection of essays regarding South Pacific culture. In 1999 the [[University of the South Pacific]] awarded him an [[honorary doctorate]] in literature. The scholar retired as institute director and dean of its university in 2007, replaced in the former post by his daughter Sisi{{okina}}uno (in 2008 and from 2010) and son Niulala (in 2009) ... and in the latter (from 2008–10 and from 2015) by Dr. Michael Horowitz, a US sociologist who served as associate dean in the late '90s.  [[Dr. 'Opeti Taliai|Dr. {{okina}}Opeti Taliai]] – a Tongan anthropologist who holds a PhD from Massey University as well as an {{okina}}Atenisi undergraduate degree – was university dean from 2013 through 2014.

In retirement, Helu remained an authority on Tongan history, tradition, and education, and although not a politician himself, remained an influential voice in Tongan politics due to the vindication of his advocacy of democracy. At {{okina}}Atenisi, he retained the title of Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and Tongan Culture.

The last years of his life were marred by declining physical and foremost mental health as he was suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]].

===Documentary film===
In August 2012, a film on Futa Helu's life and the history of {{okina}}Atenisi was screened at the New Zealand International Film Festival, garnering a favourable review in the [[New Zealand Herald]]. The documentary, ''Tongan Ark'', was written, filmed and directed by Paul Janman, an NZ anthropologist and former {{okina}}Atenisi instructor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3news.co.nz/Tongan-Ark-profiles-Futa-Helu-and-the-Atenisi-vision/tabid/1682/articleID/261778/Default.aspx Tongan Ark profiles Futa Helu and the 'Atenisi vision]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spasifikmag.com/5febtonganark/ NZ Film, Tongan Ark, is selected to screen ‘In Competition’ at FIFO Pacific International Documentary Film Festival, 11 – 17 February 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmc.aut.ac.nz/articles/sea-700-tongans-unruly-inspirational-ark At sea with 700 Tongans on an unruly, but inspirational Ark]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5790">In [[evolutionary biology]], the '''GARD (Graded Autocatalysis Replication Domain) model''' is a general kinetic model for homeostatic-growth and fission of compositional-assemblies, with specific application towards [[lipid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Segre |first1=D. |last2=Ben-Eli |first2=D. |last3=Lancet |first3=D. |year=2001 |title=Compositional genomes: Prebiotic information transfer in mutually catalytic noncovalent assemblies |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume= 97|issue= |pages=219–230 |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1073/pnas.97.8.4112  |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/97/8/4112.abstract |pmc=18166 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[abiogenesis]], the [[Abiogenesis#Lipid world|lipid-world]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Segre |first1=D. |last2=Ben-Eli |first2=D. |last3=Deamer |first3=D. |last4=Lancet |first4=D. |year=2001 |title=The lipid world |journal=Orig Life Evol Biosph |volume=31 |pages=119–145 |doi=10.1023/A:1006746807104 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/rq23036351237250/ |pmid=11296516}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests assemblies of simple molecules, such as [[lipids]], can store and propagate information, thus undergo [[evolution]].

These 'compositional assemblies' have been suggested to play a role in the origin of life. The idea is the information being transferred throughout the generations is '' compositional information '' – the different types and quantities of molecules within an assembly. This is different from the information encoded in [[RNA]] or [[DNA]], which is the specific sequence of bases in such molecule. Thus, the model is viewed as an alternative or an ancestor to the RNA world hypothesis.

==The model==

The composition vector of an assembly is written as: &lt;math&gt;v=n_1\cdots n_{N_G}&lt;/math&gt;. Where &lt;math&gt; n_1\cdots n_{N_G} &lt;/math&gt; are the molecular counts of lipid type ''i'' within the assembly, and NG is how many different lipid types exist (''repertiore size'').

The change in the count of molecule type ''i'' is described by:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dn_i}{dt} = (k_f \rho_i N-k_b n_i) \left(1+\sum_{j=1}^{N_G}\beta_{ij} \frac{n_j}{N}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;k_f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_b&lt;/math&gt; are the basel forward (joining) and backward (leaving) rate constants, ''β''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; is a non-negative rate enhancement exerted by molecule type ''j'' within the assembly on type ''i'' from the environment, and ρ is the environmental concentration of each molecule type. ''β'' is viewed as a directed, weighted, [[complex network]].

The assembly current size is &lt;math&gt;N=\sum_{i=1}^{N_G}n_i&lt;/math&gt;. The system is kept away from equilibrium by imposing a fission action once the assembly reaches a maximal size, Nmax, usually in the order of NG. This splitting action produces two progeny of same size, and one of which is grown again.&lt;br&gt;
The model is subjected to a [[Monte Carlo algorithm]] based simulations, using [[Gillespie algorithm]].

==Selection==
In 2010, [[Eors Szathmary]] and collaborators have chosen GARD as an archetypal [[metabolism-first]] realization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vasas |first1=V. |last2=Szathmary |first2=E. |last3=Santos |first3=M. |year=2010 |title=Lack of evolvability in self-sustaining autocatalytic networks constraints metabolism-first scenarios for the origin of life |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=107 |issue=4 |pages=1470–1475 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0912628107 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/107/4/1470.abstract |pmid=20080693 |pmc=2824406}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have introduced selection coefficient into the model, which increase or decrease the growth rate of assemblies, depending on how similar or dis-similar they are to a given target. They found that the ranking of the assemblies are un-affected by the selection pressure, and concluded that GARD does not exhibit Darwinian evolution.&lt;br&gt;
In 2012 it was shown that this criticism is erroneous and was refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Markovitch |first1=O. |last2=Lancet |first2=D. |year=2012 |title=Excess Mutual Catalysis Is Required for Effective Evolvability |journal=Artificial Life |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=243–266 |doi=10.1162/artl_a_00064 |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/artl_a_00064 |pmid=22662913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two major drawbacks of the 2010 paper were: (1) they have focused on a general assembly and not on a composome or compotype (faithfully replicating and [[quasispecies]], respectively); (2) they have performed only a single, random, simulation to test the selectability.

==Quasispecies==
The [[quasispecies model]] describes a population of replicators that replicate with relatively high mutations. Due to mutations and back mutations the population eventually centres around a master-replicator (master sequence). GARD's populations were shown to form a quasispecies around a master-compotype and to exhibit an [[Error catastrophe]], similarly to classical quasispecis such as RNA viruses .

When used in a sexual context, '''groping''' or '''fondling''' is [[Physical intimacy|touching]] another person in an unwelcome sexual way. The term generally has a negative connotation in many societies, and the activity may be considered [[sexual assault]]. ''[[Toucherism]]'', considered a [[paraphilia]], describes the practice of a person touching another non-consenting person with their hands, typically in crowds, for their own sexual pleasure. Touching a consenting person's body during [[sexual activity]], [[massage]], or [[medical examination]] is not usually considered groping, though the term is sometimes used to include clumsy, selfish, or inappropriate sexual touching.  Areas of the body most frequently groped include the [[buttocks]], [[breast]]s, [[vulva]] and [[thigh]]s on a woman, and the [[penis]], [[testicle]]s and buttocks on a man. Gropers might use their hands, but pressing any part of their body against another person can be considered groping.

The incidence of groping varies around the world, and some countries have acquired a reputation for it. In some countries, it is common for a woman's buttocks to be pinched or slapped in a crowded area. In many countries, non-consensual sexual touching of any part of another person's body is considered to be sexual assault and is illegal, but in almost all countries it is considered unacceptable behaviour. Italy used to have a reputation for men pinching women's bottoms, and the term groping could perhaps be applied, but it was not a common term at that time (mid-20th century, for example). Japan has a reputation for females being groped on trains and buses to the extent that the authorities have implemented anti-groping campaigns, which has received considerable media attention and been the subject of serious study in recent years. In parts of [[South Asia]], including [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;The Express Tribune, July 8, 2013: [http://tribune.com.pk/story/572526/eve-teasing-the-power-game/ Eve teasing: The power game], by Tehniya S Afridi.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nepal]]&lt;ref&gt;Smriti Lakhey, [http://www.wavemag.com.np/issue/article1549.html  "Eve Teasing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620213348/http://www.wavemag.com.np/issue/article1549.html |date=2010-06-20 }}, ''[[Wave (magazine)|Wave]]'' # 55, July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bangladesh]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailystar.net/eve-teasers-beat-dead-youth-in-dhaka-45137  "Eve-teasers beat dead youth in Dhaka"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012100511/http://www.thedailystar.net/eve-teasers-beat-dead-youth-in-dhaka-45137 |date=2014-10-12 }}, ''[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|Daily Star]]'', 11 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; public [[sexual harassment]] or [[Sexual assault|molestation]] (often known as "[[street harassment]]") of women by men is widely referred to as [[Eve teasing]].

In Japan, men who grope women in public are called ''chikan'' (痴漢, チカン, or ちかん); and the term also describes the act itself. Crowded trains are a favorite location for groping and a 2001 survey conducted in two Tokyo high schools revealed that more than 2/3rds of students had been groped while traveling on them.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buerk|first1=Roland|title=Tokyo police act on train gropers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8254389.stm|accessdate=12 November 2017|work=BBC|agency=BBC|publisher=BBC|date=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the effort to combat the problem, some railway companies designate [[women-only passenger car]]s during rush hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071226060039/http://www.belsona-strategic.com/hisandhers_subway.htm The His and Hers Subway]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/International/story?id=803965&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 "Japan Tries Women Only Train Cars to Stop Groping: Tokyo Subway Experiment Attempts to Slow Epidemic of Subway Fondling"] An ABC News article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071218143817/http://www.truthout.org/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/35/11500 "Women Only Cars on Commuter Trains Cause Controversy in Japan"]&lt;/ref&gt; While the term is not defined in the Japanese legal system, vernacular usage of the word describes acts that violate several laws. Although crowded trains are the most frequent targets, another common setting is bicycle parking areas, where people bending over unlocking locks are targets. Chikan is often featured in [[Japanese pornography]].

This issue affects men in a different way. Since Japan has a very high conviction rate (99% by some sources), innocent men may have difficulty proving their innocence in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=20 February 2007 |title=Tokyo legal drama gets grip on groping |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=7&amp;art_id=38575&amp;sid=12296751&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20070220 |deadurl=yes |newspaper=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731162401/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=7&amp;art_id=38575&amp;sid=12296751&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20070220 |archivedate=31 July 2009 |accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[I Just Didn't Do It]]'' by Japanese film director [[Masayuki Suo]], based on a true story, focuses on a male office worker acquitted of groping after a five-year legal battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kamiya |first=Setsuko |title='I Just Didn't Do It' questions the Japanese court system |work=[[The Japan Times]] |date=2007-02-02 |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070202a6.html |accessdate=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criminal courts have traditionally been lenient in cases of groping and have only recently made efforts to combat the social problem with tougher sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Lewis| first =Leo| title =All women trains are only way to defeat Tokyo bottom pinchers| publisher =The Times Online |date =2004-11-24| url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article394630.ece| accessdate =2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fukada, Takahiro, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090818i1.html In anonymous packed train lurk gropers]", ''The Japan Times'', August 18, 2009, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
Groping is illegal when there is no consent. The charge can vary from state to state but generally is considered to be [[sexual battery]], sexual groping, or unlawful touching. In some jurisdictions, groping is considered "Criminal Sexual Conduct", in the second to fourth degree, if there is no penetration.

*Florida: [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP)  Officer Paulo Morales, 47, of Miami, pleaded guilty to sexually groping three women in his custody. Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division stated, “The Justice Department will continue to investigate and prosecute criminal civil rights violations committed by law enforcement officials”, and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Wifredo A. Ferrer stated, “My office and the Department of Justice are fully committed to protecting the civil rights of our citizens from all types of abuses.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/July/12-crt-913.html Department of Justice]- Retrieved 2012-08-08&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Third International Intersex Forum.jpg|thumb|300px|Participants at the third [[International Intersex Forum]], Malta, in December 2013]]
[[Intersex]] people are born with [[sex]] characteristics, such as [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s, that, according to the UN [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], "do not fit typical binary notions of [[male]] or [[female]] bodies."&lt;ref name="unfe-fact"&gt;{{Cite web| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | publisher = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Free &amp; Equal Campaign Fact Sheet: Intersex| date = 2015| url = https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | access-date = 28 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersex people face stigmatisation and discrimination from birth, particularly when an intersex variation is visible. In some countries (particularly in Africa and Asia) this may include [[infanticide]], abandonment and the stigmatization of families. Mothers in [[East Africa]] may be accused of witchcraft, and the birth of an intersex child may be described as a [[curse]].&lt;ref name="cschrcl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbkci2015"/&gt;

Intersex infants and children, such as those with ambiguous outer genitalia, may be surgically and/or hormonally altered to fit perceived more socially-acceptable sex characteristics. However, this is considered controversial, with no firm evidence of good outcomes.&lt;ref name="apeg2013"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=aafe43f3-c6a2-4525-ad16-15e4210ee0ac&amp;subId=16191 | title = Submission 88 to the Australian Senate inquiry on the involuntary or coerced sterilisation of people with disabilities in Australia | work = Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group (APEG) | date = 27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such treatments may involve sterilization.

Implementation of human rights protections in legislation and regulation has progressed more slowly. In 2011, [[Christiane Völling]] won the first successful case brought against a surgeon for non-consensual surgical intervention.&lt;ref name="voll" /&gt; In 2015, the [[Council of Europe]] recognized for the first time a right for intersex persons to ''not'' undergo sex assignment treatment.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; In April 2015, [[Intersex rights in Malta|Malta]] became the first country to outlaw nonconsensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people.&lt;ref name="nyt-2015"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Reuters| title = Surgery and Sterilization Scrapped in Malta's Benchmark LGBTI Law| work = The New York Times| date = 1 April 2015| url = https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/04/01/world/europe/01reuters-gay-rights-malta.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="star-2015"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Star Observer| authorlink = Star Observer | title = Malta passes law outlawing forced surgical intervention on intersex minors| work = Star Observer| date = 2 April 2015| url = http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/international-news-news/malta-passes-law-outlawing-forced-surgical-intervention-on-intersex-minors/134800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other human rights and legal issues include the right to life, protection from discrimination, access to justice and reparations, access to information, and legal recognition.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt; Few countries so far protect intersex people from discrimination, or provide access to reparations for harmful practices.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

==Intersex and human rights==
[[File:ILGA conference 2018 Intersex Awareness Day group photo.jpg|thumb|300px|ILGA conference 2018, group photo to mark [[Intersex Awareness Day]]]]
Research indicates a growing consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal—if relatively rare—forms of human biology,&lt;ref name=Zderic&gt;{{cite book|first=  Stephen |last = Zderic|title=Pediatric gender assignment : a critical reappraisal ; [proceedings from a conference ... in Dallas in the spring of 1999 which was entitled "pediatric gender assignment - a critical reappraisal"]|year=2002|publisher=Kluwer Acad. / Plenum Publ.|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=978-0306467592}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on medical practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. A 2013 first international pilot study. [[Human Rights between the Sexes]], by [[Dan Christian Ghattas]],&lt;ref name="ghattas"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/endf_human_rights_between_the_sexes.pdf | title = Human Rights Between the Sexes | first1 = Dan Christian | last1 = Ghattas | authorlink1 = Dan Christian Ghattas | last2 = [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] | date = September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oiieurope.org/a-preliminary-study-on-the-life-situations-of-inter-individuals/ | title = A preliminary study on the life situations of inter* individuals | work = [[OII Europe]] | date = 4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that intersex people are discriminated against worldwide:
{{quotation|Intersex individuals are considered individuals with a «disorder» in all areas in which Western medicine prevails. They are more or less obviously treated as sick or «abnormal», depending on the respective society.}}

The [[Council of Europe]] highlights several areas of concern:

* unnecessary "normalising" treatment of intersex persons, and unnecessary pathologisation of variations in sex characteristics.
* unnecessary medicalisation is said to also impact a right to life.
* inclusion in equal treatment and hate crime law; facilitating access to justice and reparations.
* access to information, medical records, peer and other counselling and support.
* respecting self-determination in gender recognition, through expeditious access to official documents.&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;{{Citation| last1 = [[Council of Europe]]| last2 = Commissioner for Human Rights| title = Human rights and intersex people, Issue Paper| date = April 2015| url = https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=CommDH/IssuePaper(2015)1&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the implementation, codification and enforcement of intersex human rights remains slow. These actions take place through legislation, regulation and court cases, detailed below.

=== "Pinkwashing" ===
{{main|Intersex and LGBT}}
Multiple organizations have highlighted appeals to LGBT rights recognition that fail to address the issue of unnecessary "normalising" treatments on intersex children, using the portmanteau term "[[Pinkwashing (LGBT)|pinkwashing]]". In June 2016, [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] pointed to contradictory statements by Australian governments, suggesting that the dignity and rights of LGBTI (LGBT and intersex) people are recognized while, at the same time, harmful practices on intersex children continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Submission: list of issues for Australia's Convention Against Torture review | url = https://oii.org.au/30546/loi-cat-review/ | work = [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] | date = June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, [[Zwischengeschlecht]] described actions to promote equality or civil status legislation without action on banning "intersex genital mutilations" as a form of [[Pinkwashing (LGBT)|pinkwashing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = "Intersex legislation" that allows the daily mutilations to continue = PINKWASHING of IGM practices | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/Intersex-politics-that-ignore-the-daily-mutilations-PINKWASHING-OF-IGM-PRACTICES | work = [[Zwischengeschlecht]] | date = August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has previously highlighted evasive government statements to UN Treaty Bodies that conflate intersex, transgender and LGBT issues, instead of addressing harmful practices on infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = TRANSCRIPTION &gt; UK Questioned over Intersex Genital Mutilations by UN Committee on the Rights of the Child - Gov Non-Answer + Denial | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/UK-Questioned-over-Intersex-Genital-Mutilations-by-UN-Committee-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child | work = [[Zwischengeschlecht]] | date = May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersex people face stigmatisation and discrimination from birth. In some countries, particularly in Africa and Asia, this may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. Mothers in east Africa may be accused of witchcraft, and the birth of an intersex child may be described as a curse.&lt;ref name="cschrcl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2017"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39780214 | title = The midwife who saved intersex babies | first1 = Helen | last1 = Grady |first2 = Anne | last2 = Soy | work = BBC World Service, Kenya | date = May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abandonments and infanticides have been reported in [[Intersex rights in Uganda|Uganda]],&lt;ref name="cschrcl"&gt;{{Cite web| last1 = Civil Society Coalition on Human Rights and Constitutional Law| last2 = Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum| last3 = Rainbow Health Foundation| last4 = Sexual Minorities Uganda| last5 = Support Initiative for Persons with Congenital Disorders| title = Uganda Report of Violations based on Sex Determination, Gender Identity, and Sexual Orientation| date = 2014| url = http://www.hrapf.org/publications/research-papers/uganda-report-violations-based-sex-determination-gender-identity-and| access-date = 2017-05-14| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150503012642/http://www.hrapf.org/publications/research-papers/uganda-report-violations-based-sex-determination-gender-identity-and| archive-date = 2015-05-03| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intersex rights in Kenya|Kenya]],&lt;ref name="76crimes" /&gt; [[Intersex rights in India|south Asia]],&lt;ref name="warne2008"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s11154-008-9084-2| issn = 1389-9155| volume = 9| issue = 3| pages = 227–236| last1 = Warne| first1 = Garry L.| last2 = Raza| first2 = Jamal| title = Disorders of sex development (DSDs), their presentation and management in different cultures| journal = Reviews in Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders| date = September 2008| pmid=18633712| citeseerx = 10.1.1.469.9016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Intersex rights in China|China]].&lt;ref name="bbkci2015"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Beyond the Boundary - Knowing and Concerns Intersex| title = Intersex report from Hong Kong China, and for the UN Committee Against Torture: the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment| date = October 2015| url = http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=INT%2fCAT%2fCSS%2fHKG%2f22156&amp;Lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, it was reported that an intersex [[Intersex rights in Kenya|Kenyan]] adolescent, Muhadh Ishmael, was mutilated and later died.

Non-consensual medical interventions to modify the sex characteristics of intersex people take place in all countries where the human rights of intersex people have been explored.&lt;ref name="ghattas" /&gt; Such interventions have been criticized by the World Health Organization, other UN bodies such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and an increasing number of regional and national institutions. In low and middle income countries, the cost of healthcare may limit access to necessary medical treatment at the same time that other individuals experience coercive medical interventions.&lt;ref name="bbkci2015" /&gt;

Several rights have been stated as affected by stigmatization and coercive medical interventions on minors:
* the [[right to life]].&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;
* the [[right to privacy]], including a right to personal [[autonomy]] or self-determination regarding medical treatment.&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="swissnek" /&gt;

===Human rights reports===
[[File:Small Ela Luk.jpg|thumb|Hong Kong intersex activist [[Small Luk]]]]
{{further|Intersex human rights reports}}
These issues have been addressed by a rapidly increasing number of international institutions. In 2012, the Swiss National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics reported.&lt;ref name="swissnek" /&gt; In 2013, they included the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,&lt;ref name="untorture"/&gt; and the Australian Senate.&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation" /&gt; In 2015 they included the Council of Europe, the United Nations [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] and the [[World Health Organization]]. In April 2015, [[Intersex rights in Malta|Malta]] became the first country to outlaw coercive medical interventions.&lt;ref name="nyt-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="star-2015" /&gt; In the same year, the Council of Europe became the first institution to state that intersex people have the right ''not'' to undergo sex affirmation interventions.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;

For [[Intersex Awareness Day]], October 26, UN experts including the [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|Committee against Torture]], the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], along with the Council of Europe [[Commissioner for Human Rights]], the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] and [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]]s called for an urgent end to human rights violations against intersex persons, including in medical settings. The experts also called for the investigation of human rights abuses, access to reparations, and the implementation of anti-discrimination measures:&lt;ref name="un-2016"&gt;{{Citation| last = Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights| authorlink = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |title = End violence and harmful medical practices on intersex children and adults, UN and regional experts urge| date = October 24, 2016| url = http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20739&amp;LangID=E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|In countries around the world, intersex infants, children and adolescents are subjected to medically unnecessary surgeries, hormonal treatments and other procedures in an attempt to forcibly change their appearance to be in line with societal expectations about female and male bodies. When, as is frequently the case, these procedures are performed without the full, free and informed consent of the person concerned, they amount to violations of fundamental human rights...

States must, as a matter of urgency, prohibit medically unnecessary surgery and procedures on intersex children. They must uphold the autonomy of intersex adults and children and their rights to health, to physical and mental integrity, to live free from violence and harmful practices and to be free from torture and ill-treatment. Intersex children and their parents should be provided with support and counselling, including from peers.&lt;ref name="un-2016" /&gt;}}

In 2017, the human rights non-governmental organizations [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref name="amnesty2017report"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Amnesty International| title = First, Do No Harm| date = 2017 | url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur01/6086/2017/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amnesty2017post"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Amnesty International| title = First, Do No Harm: ensuring the rights of children born intersex.| accessdate = 2017-05-13 | date = 2017 | url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/05/intersex-rights/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Human Rights Watch]]&lt;ref name="hrw2017"&gt;{{Cite book| isbn = 978-1-62313-502-7| last1 = Human Rights Watch| author1-link = Human Rights Watch | last2 = interACT | author2-link = Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth | title = I Want to Be Like Nature Made Me| date = July 2017| url = https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stewart2017"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Stewart| first = Philippa| title = Interview: Intersex Babies Don't Need 'Fixing'| work = Human Rights Watch| accessdate = 2017-07-25| date = 2017-07-25| url = https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/25/interview-intersex-babies-dont-need-fixing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw2017b"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Human Rights Watch| title = US: Harmful Surgery on Intersex Children| work = Human Rights Watch| accessdate = 2017-07-25| date = 2017-07-25| url = https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/25/us-harmful-surgery-intersex-children}}&lt;/ref&gt; published major reports on the rights of children with intersex conditions.

===Constitutional Court of Colombia===
{{main|Intersex rights in Colombia}}
Although not many cases of children with intersex conditions are available, a case taken to the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia]] led to changes in their treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Skyler|title=Reproductive Organs and Differences of Sex Development: The Constitutional Issues Created by the Surgical Treatment of Intersex Children|journal=McGeorge Law Review|year=2010–2011|volume=42|page=863|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mcglr42&amp;div=66&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case restricted the power of doctors and parents to decide surgical procedures on children's ambiguous genitalia after the age of five, while continuing to permit interventions on younger children. Due to the decision of the Constitutional Court of Colombia on Case 1 Part 1 (SU-337 of 1999), doctors are obliged to inform parents on all the aspects of the intersex child. Parents can only consent to surgery if they have received accurate information, and cannot give consent after the child reaches the age of five. By then the child will have, supposedly, realized their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corte Constitucional de Colombia: Sentencia T-1025/02|url=http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/relatoria/2002/t-1025-02.htm|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court case led to the setting of legal guidelines for doctors' surgical practice on intersex children.

===Maltese legislation===
{{main|Intersex rights in Malta}}
In April 2015, [[Intersex rights in Malta|Malta]] became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions in a ''Gender Identity Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act''.&lt;ref name="nyt-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="star-2015" /&gt; The Act recognizes a right to bodily integrity and physical autonomy, explicitly prohibiting modifications to children's sex characteristics for social factors:

{{quotation|14. (1) It shall be unlawful for medical practitioners or other professionals to conduct any sex assignment treatment and/or surgical intervention on the sex characteristics of a minor which treatment and/or intervention can be deferred until the person to be treated can provide informed consent: Provided that such sex assignment treatment and/or surgical intervention on the sex characteristics of the minor shall be conducted if the minor gives informed consent through the person exercising parental authority or the tutor of the minor.
(2) In exceptional circumstances treatment may be effected once agreement is reached between the Interdisciplinary Team and the persons exercising parental authority or tutor of the minor who is still unable to provide consent: Provided that medical intervention which is driven by social factors without the consent of the minor, will be in violation of this Act.&lt;ref name="gigesc"&gt;{{Citation| last = Malta| title = Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act: Final version| date = April 2015| url = http://justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lp&amp;itemid=26805&amp;l=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Chilean regulations===
{{main|Intersex rights in Chile}}

==Right to life==
{{further|Genetic diagnosis of intersex}}
[[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD or PIGD) refers to [[Genetics|genetic]] testing of [[embryo]]s prior to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] (as a form of [[embryo profiling]]), and sometimes even of [[oocyte]]s prior to [[Fertilisation|fertilization]]. PGD is considered in a similar fashion to [[prenatal diagnosis]]. When used to screen for a specific genetic condition, the method makes it highly likely that the baby will be free of the condition under consideration. PGD thus is an adjunct to [[assisted reproductive technology]], and requires [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) to obtain [[oocytes]] or [[embryo]]s for evaluation. The technology allows discrimination against those with [[intersex]] traits.

[[Georgiann Davis]] argues that such discrimination fails to recognize that many people with intersex traits led full and happy lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/15265161.2013.828119| issn = 1526-5161| volume = 13| issue = 10| pages = 51–53| last = Davis| first = Georgiann| author-link=Georgiann Davis|title = The Social Costs of Preempting Intersex Traits| journal = The American Journal of Bioethics| date = October 2013| pmid=24024811}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morgan Carpenter]] highlights the appearance of several intersex variations in a list by the UK [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]] of "serious" "genetic conditions" that may be de-selected, including [[5 alpha reductase deficiency]] and [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], traits evident in elite women athletes and "the world's first openly [[Tony Briffa|intersex mayor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Carpenter| first = Morgan| author-link=Morgan Carpenter |title = Morgan Carpenter at LGBTI Human Rights in the Commonwealth conference| location = Glasgow| date = July 18, 2014| url = http://oii.org.au/27467/lgbti-human-rights-in-the-commonwealth/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] has called for the Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] to prohibit such interventions, noting a "close entanglement of intersex status, gender identity and sexual orientation in social understandings of sex and gender norms, and in medical and medical sociology literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report| publisher = Organisation Intersex International Australia| last1 = Carpenter| first1 = Morgan| last2 = [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]]| title = Submission on the Review of Part B of the Ethical Guidelines for the Use of Assisted Reproductive Technology in Clinical Practice and Research, 2007| location = Sydney| date = April 30, 2014| url = http://oii.org.au/25621/submission-ethics-genetic-selection-intersex-traits/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Council of Europe]] published an Issue Paper on ''Human rights and intersex people'', remarking:

{{quotation|Intersex people's right to life can be violated in discriminatory “sex selection” and “preimplantation genetic diagnosis, other forms of testing, and selection for particular characteristics”. Such de-selection or selective abortions are incompatible with ethics and human rights standards due to the discrimination perpetrated against intersex people on the basis of their sex characteristics.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;}}

A handful of jurisdictions so far provide explicit protection from discrimination for intersex people. [[Intersex rights in South Africa|South Africa]] was the first country to explicitly add intersex to legislation, as part of the attribute of 'sex'.&lt;ref name="zagaz"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2005-022.pdf | title = Judicial Matters Amendment Act, No. 22 of 2005, Republic of South Africa, Vol. 487, Cape Town | date = 11 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intersex rights in Australia|Australia]] was the first country to add an independent attribute, of 'intersex status'.&lt;ref name="com law"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013A00098 | title = Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act 2013, No. 98, 2013, C2013A00098 | work = ComLaw | date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intersex rights in Malta|Malta]] was the first to adopt a broader framework of 'sex characteristics', through legislation that also ended modifications to the sex characteristics of minors undertaken for social and cultural reasons.&lt;ref name="gate-malta" /&gt;  [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] listed as "sex characteristics"&lt;ref name="ilgaeurope"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ilga-europe.org/resources/news/latest-news/anti-discrimination-law-updated-bosnia-herzegovina | title = Anti-discrimination Law Updated in Bosnia-Herzegovina | work = [[ILGA-Europe]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lezbelib.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lezbelib.com/europe-news/lgbti-people-are-now-better-protected-in-bosnia-and-herzegovina | title = LGBTI people are now better protected in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greece]] prohibits discrimination and hate crimes based on "sex characteristics", since 24 December 2015.&lt;ref name="et.gr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Πρώτη φορά, ίσοι απέναντι στον νόμο"&gt;{{el icon}}{{cite web | url = http://www.efsyn.gr/arthro/proti-fora-isoi-apenanti-ston-nomo | title = Πρώτη φορά, ίσοι απέναντι στον νόμο| date = 2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
An Australian survey of 272 persons born with atypical sex characteristics, published in 2016, found that 18% of respondents (compared to an Australian average of 2%) failed to complete secondary school, with early school leaving coincident with pubertal medical interventions, bullying and other factors.&lt;ref name="jones2016ed"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/14681811.2016.1149808| issn = 1468-1811 | pages = 1–17| last = Jones| first = Tiffany| title = The needs of students with intersex variations| journal = Sex Education| volume = 16 | issue = 6 | date = March 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrimination protection intersects with involuntary and coercive medical treatment. Maltese protections on grounds of [[sex characteristics]] provides explicit protection against unnecessary and harmful modifications to the sex characteristics of children.&lt;ref name="star-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gate-malta" /&gt;

In May 2016, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] issued a statement explaining Section 1557 of the [[Affordable Care Act]] stating that the Act prohibits "discrimination on the basis of intersex traits or atypical sex characteristics" in publicly-funded healthcare, as part of a prohibition of discrimination "on the basis of sex".&lt;ref name="interacthealth"&gt;{{cite web| last = [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth|interACT]]| title = Federal Government Bans Discrimination Against Intersex People in Health Care| work = interactadvocates| accessdate = 2016-05-27| url = http://interactadvocates.org/federal-government-bans-discrimination-against-intersex-people-in-health-care/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of modern medical science in Western societies, many intersex people with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either female or male genitals.

Some intersex organizations claim that secrecy-based models have been perpetuated by a shift in clinical language to [[Disorders of sex development]]. [[Morgan Carpenter]] of [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] quotes the work of [[Miranda Fricker]] on "hermeneutical injustice" where, despite new legal protections from discrimination on grounds of intersex status, "someone with lived experience is unable to even make sense of their own social experiences" due to the deployment of clinical language and "no words to name the experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Organisation Intersex International Australia| last = Carpenter| first = Morgan| title = Intersex and ageing| date = February 3, 2015 | url = https://oii.org.au/28385/intersex-and-ageing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal recognition ==
{{main|Legal recognition of intersex people}}
According to the [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of National Human Rights Institutions, few countries have provided for the legal recognition of intersex people. The Forum states that the legal recognition of intersex people is:

* firstly about access to the same rights as other men and women, when assigned male or female; 
* secondly it is about access to administrative corrections to legal documents when an original [[sex assignment]] is not appropriate; and 
* thirdly, while opt in schemes may help some individuals, legal recognition is not about the creation of a third sex or gender classification for intersex people as a population, but instead is about enabling an opt-in scheme for any individual who seeks it.&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

In some jurisdictions, access to any form of identification document can be an issue.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

===Gender identities===
Like all individuals, some intersex individuals may be raised as a particular sex (male or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not.&lt;ref name="Money"&gt;{{cite book|last=Money |first=John |author2=Ehrhardt, Anke A. |title=Man &amp; Woman Boy &amp; Girl.

A 2012 clinical review suggests that between 8.5-20% of persons with intersex conditions may experience [[gender dysphoria]],&lt;ref name="furtado"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Furtado P.

===Access to identification documents===
Depending on the jurisdiction, access to any birth certificate may be an issue,&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/05/us-kenya-intersex-idUSKCN0JJ1M120141205|title=Kenya takes step toward recognizing intersex people in landmark ruling|journal=Reuters|date=2014-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a birth certificate with a sex marker.&lt;ref name="adv-de"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2013/11/06/op-ed-germany's-third-gender-law-fails-equality | first = Hida | last = Viloria | work = The Advocate | title = Op-ed: Germany's Third-Gender Law Fails on Equality | date = November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014, in the case of ''Baby 'A' (Suing through her Mother E.A) &amp; another v Attorney General &amp; 6 others [2014]'', a Kenyan court ordered the Kenyan government to issue a birth certificate to a five-year-old child born in 2009 with ambiguous genitalia.&lt;ref name="Reuters2014"&gt;{{cite news| last = Migiro| first = Katy|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/05/us-kenya-intersex-idUSKCN0JJ1M120141205|title=Kenya takes step toward recognizing intersex people in landmark ruling|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Intersex rights in Kenya|Kenya]] a birth certificate is necessary for attending school, getting a national identity document, and voting.&lt;ref name="Reuters2014"/&gt; Many intersex persons in [[Intersex rights in Uganda|Uganda]] are understood to be stateless due to historical difficulties in obtaining identification documents, despite a birth registration law that permits intersex minors to change assignment.&lt;ref name="sipd2016"&gt;{{Cite| last = Support Initiative for Persons with Congenital Disorders| title = Baseline Survey on Intersex Realities in East Africa - Specific Focus on Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda| date = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to the same rights as other men and women===
The [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of [[National Human Rights Institutions]] states that:
{{quotation|Recognition before the law means having legal personhood and the legal protections that flow from that. For intersex people, this is neither primarily nor solely about amending birth registrations or other official documents. Firstly, it is about intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate being able to enjoy the same legal rights as other men and women&lt;ref name="afp2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = [[Asia Pacific Forum|Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions]]| isbn = 978-0-9942513-7-4| last = Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions| title = Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics| date = June 2016| url = http://www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-sogi-and-sex-charactersitics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Binary categories===
Access to a birth certificate with a correct sex marker may be an issue for people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth,&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; or it may only be available accompanied by surgical requirements.&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

===Third categories===
The passports and identification documents of [[Intersex rights in Australia|Australia]] and some other nationalities have adopted "X" as a valid third category besides "M" (male) and "F" (female), at least since 2003.&lt;ref name="Science as Culture"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ingrid | last = Holme | title = Hearing People's Own Stories | journal = Science as Culture | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | doi = 10.1080/09505430802280784 | date = 2008| pages=341–344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nzpass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.passports.govt.nz/Transgender-applicants|title=New Zealand Passports - Information about Changing Sex / Gender Identity|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Germany became the first European nation to allow babies with characteristics of both sexes to be registered as ''indeterminate gender'' on birth certificates, amidst opposition and skepticism from intersex organisations who point out that the law appears to mandate exclusion from male or female categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dw.de/third-sex-option-on-birth-certificates/a-17193869 | title = Third sex option on birth certificates | work = [[Deutsche Welle]] | date = 1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oiieurope.org/bluff-package-for-inter-leaving-sex-entry-open-is-not-an-option/ | title = Sham package for Intersex: Leaving sex entry open is not an option | work = [[OII Europe]] | date = 15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://rt.com/news/germany-allows-third-gender-062/ | title = 'X' gender: Germans no longer have to classify their kids as male or female | work = [[RT (TV network)|RT]] | date = 3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Europe acknowledged this approach, and concerns about recognition of third and blank classifications in a 2015 Issue Paper, stating that these may lead to "forced outings" and "lead to an increase in pressure on parents of intersex children to decide in favour of one sex."&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; The Issue Paper argues that "further reflection on non-binary legal identification is necessary":

{{quotation|[[Mauro Cabral]], [[Global Action for Trans Equality]] (GATE) Co-Director, indicated that any recognition outside the “F”/”M” dichotomy needs to be adequately planned and executed with a human rights point of view, noting that: “People tend to identify a third sex with freedom from the gender binary, but that is not necessarily the case. If only trans and/or intersex people can access that third category, or if they are compulsively assigned a third sex, then the gender binary gets stronger, not weaker”&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;}}

'''Jeong Yakyong''' / '''Jung Yak-Yong''' (5 August 1762 &amp;ndash; 7 April 1836), often simply known as '''‘Dasan’''' (茶山, one of his ‘ho’ / pen-names meaning ‘the mountain of tea’), was born on the 16th day of the 6th lunar month, 1762, in [[Gwangju]] county, [[Gyeonggi]] province, and died there on the 22nd day of the 2nd lunar month, 1836. He was one of the greatest thinkers of the later [[Joseon]] period, wrote highly influential books about philosophy, science and theories of government, held significant administrative positions, was a close confidant of [[Jeongjo of Joseon|King Jeongjo]] (ruled 1776-1800), and was noted as a poet. His philosophical position is often identified with the [[Silhak]] (practical learning) school, and his concerns are better seen as explorations of [[Neo-Confucian]] themes. He spent 18 years in exile in [[Gangjin]], South [[Jeolla]] province, from 1801 until 1818, on account of his membership of the Southerners (Nam-in) faction, and also because of the Catholic faith of his elder brother. His clan originated in Naju, South [[Jeolla]] Province. At birth he was given the courtesy title (初字 choja) Gwi’nong (歸農), and later he was also known by the ja Miyong (美鏞) and Songbu (頌甫)美庸); among his ho (號, pen-names) were Saam (俟菴), Tagong (籜翁), Taesu (苔叟), Jahadoin (紫霞道人), Cheolmasanin (鐵馬山人), Dasan (茶山), Yeoyudang (與猶堂, the name of his house), and Mundo (文度, his name as a poet). Korean Catholics sometimes claim that he was baptized with the name John Baptist, but there is no documentary proof of this.

==Biography==

===Family history===
Dasan's father was Jeong Jae-won (丁載遠, 1730–1792). His eldest brother Yak-hyeon (若鉉, 1751–1821) was the son of a first wife, while [[Jeong Yak-jong]] (若鍾, 1760–1801), Yak-jeon (若銓, 1758–1816), and Yakyong were the sons of their father's second wife, Suk-in (淑人, 1730–1770) from the [[Haenam]] Yun 尹 family. There was one daughter from this second marriage. Four other daughters were later born of a third marriage.

Dasan's father's family traced their descent back to Jeong Ja-geup (丁子伋, 1423–1487) who in 1460 first took a government position under [[Sejo of Joseon|King Sejo]]. Eight further generations then followed his example. Jeong Si-yun (丁時潤, 1646–1713) and his second son Do-bok (道復, 1666–1720) were the last of the line, since the Southerners’ faction to which the family belonged lost power in 1694. Si-yun retired to a house in Mahyeon-ri to the east of [[Seoul]] (now known as [[Namyangju]]) in 1699, which was to be Dasan's birthplace. His eldest son, Do-tae (道泰) lived there and was Dasan's direct ancestor. The Southerners remained excluded from official positions until a brief period that began during the reign of [[Jeongjo of Joseon|King Jeongjo]], when Dasan's father was appointed magistrate of [[Jinju]] county, thanks to his strong links with the powerful Chae Je-gong (蔡濟恭, 1720–99), who rose until he was appointed third state councillor in 1788. In 1762, the execution of Crown Prince Sado by his father the king so shocked Jeong Jae-won that he withdrew from official life and returned to his home in Mahyeon-ri. This explains the courtesy name Gwi’nong (‘back to farming’) his father gave Dasan, who was born in the same year. As a result, Dasan grew up receiving intense intellectual training from his now unoccupied father.&lt;ref&gt;Setton, Mark. Chong Yakyong. page 54&lt;/ref&gt;

The source of Dasan's intellectual interests can be traced to the influence of the great scholar Udam Jeong Si-han (愚潭 丁時翰, 1625–1707) of the same clan, who taught Jeong Si-yun briefly and was then the main teacher of Dasan's ancestor Jeong Do-tae as well as his brother Do-je (1675–1729). One of the most significant thinkers in the next generation was the philosopher-scholar [[Seongho Yi Ik]] (星湖 李瀷, 1681–1763) and he saw Udam as the authentic heir of Toegye [[Yi Hwang]] (退溪 李滉, 1501–1570). Jeong Do-je transmitted the teachings of Udam to the next generations of the family and so they were passed to Dasan's father and Dasan himself.

Similarly, Dasan's mother was descended from the family of the famous Southerner scholar-poet Gosan [[Yun Seon-do]] (孤山 尹善道, 1587–1671). Yun's great-grandson Gongjae [[Yun Du-seo]] (恭齋 尹斗緖, 1668–1715), well known for his skills as a painter, was Dasan's maternal great-grandfather. He and his elder brother were close to [[Seongho Yi Ik]] and his brothers, and are credited with reviving the study of the Six Classics, as well as the thought of Toegye.&lt;ref&gt;Setton, Mark. Chong Yakyong. page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life===
By the age of 6, Dasan's father was impressed by his powers of observation. By the age of 9 he had composed a small collection of poems. In 1776, Dasan was married to Hong Hwabo of the Pungsan Hong clan, the daughter of a royal secretary; in that year he moved to Seoul, where his father received an appointment in the Board of Taxation after the accession of [[Jeongjo of Joseon|King Jeongjo]]. When he was 15, Dasan was introduced to the writings of [[Seongho Yi Ik]] by one of his descendants, Yi Ga-Hwan (李家煥, 1742–1801) and his brother-in-law [[Yi Seung-hun]] (李承薰, 1756–1801) and he was deeply impressed, resolving to devote his life to similar studies.
In 1783, Dasan passed the chinsagwa (literary licentiate examination), which allowed him to enter the [[Seonggyungwan]] (national Confucian academy).

In 1784 the king was deeply impressed by the “objectivity” of Dasan's replies to a set of questions he had formulated. This was the start of an increasingly close relationship between the king and Dasan. After the promotion of Chae Je-gong in 1788, Dasan took top place in the ''daegwa'' (higher civil service exam) in 1789 and was offered a position in the Office of Royal Decrees, together with 5 other members of the Southerner faction. This alarmed members of the opposing ‘Old Doctrine’ faction, who soon realized the extent to which the Southerners were being influenced, not only by the Practical Learning introduced to China from Europe, but by [[Roman Catholicism]] itself.

In 1784, [[Yi Byeok]] (李蘗, 1754–1786), a scholar who had participated in meetings to study books about the Western (European) Learning, starting in 1777, talked with Dasan about the new religion for the first time in 1784 and gave him a book about it. Whatever his own response may have been, and there is no proof that he ever received baptism, Dasan's immediate family was deeply involved in the origins of the Korean Catholic community. His older sister was married to [[Yi Seung-hun]], the Korean who was first baptized as a Catholic in [[Beijing]] in 1784 and played a leading role in the early years of the Church's growth. The oldest of Jeong Jae-won's sons, Yak-hyeon, was married to a sister of [[Yi Byeok]]. Another daughter, from a third marriage, later married Hwang Sa-yeong (1775–1801), author of the notorious Silk Letter. Dasan's older brother, [[Jeong Yak-jong]] (Augustinus) was the leader of the first Catholic community and one of the first victims of the purge launched against Southerners, but especially against Catholics, in 1801, after the sudden death of [[Jeongjo of Joseon|King Jeongjo]].

In 1789, Yun Ji-chung, one of the first baptized and a cousin to Dasan on his mother's side, had gone to Beijing and received confirmation. Rome had forbidden Catholics to perform ancestral rituals and this was now being strictly applied by the Portuguese Franciscan bishop of Beijing Alexandre de Gouvea. When his mother died in 1791, Yun therefore refused to perform the usual Confucian ceremonies; this became public knowledge, he was accused of impiety and was executed. Some Koreans who had at first been sympathetic, horrified by the Church's rejection of hallowed traditions, turned away. Jeong Yakyong may well have been among them.&lt;ref&gt;Setton, Mark. Chong Yakyong. page 59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Service===
Dasan was particularly interested in civil engineering and in 1792 the king, impressed by a pontoon bridge he had designed, asked him to design and supervise the construction of the walls for the [[Hwaseong Fortress]] (modern Suwon), which surrounded the palace where the king would live when he visited the new tomb he had constructed for his father. Dasan produced radically new techniques and structures, drawing on European, Chinese and Japanese sources. In 1794, after several promotions, the king appointed him as secret envoy to Gyeongi province, investigating reports of corruption.

Dasan's most important task in 1795, the 60th anniversary of the birth of [[Crown Prince Sado]], was to help the King decide on a new honorary title for his father. This was a fraught enterprise, the Prince's supporters were members of what was called the Expediency subfaction while his main enemies were members of the Principle subfaction. The Southerners were strong supporters of the King's wish to honor Sado highly and the King was more than grateful. However, he then found it prudent to send Dasan away from court for a time, appointing him to be superintendent of the post station at Geumjeong, South Pyeongan province.

Here, he provided clear proof of his rejection of Catholicism by doing everything possible to persuade the Catholics working there to renounce their faith, and in particular to perform ancestral rites. Almost certainly, it was the Catholics’ rejection of Confucian ritual that had turned him against them. In 1796, he was brought back to Seoul and promoted but his many enemies continued to accuse him of supporting the pro-western Catholics and he preferred to take up a position as county magistrate at Goksan in [[Hwanghae]] province.

In 1799 he even withdrew to his family home but was summoned back to Seoul by the king in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Setton, Mark. Chong Yakyong. page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exile===
In the summer of 1800, King Jeongjo died suddenly. The new king, [[Sunjo of Joseon|King Sunjo]], was still only a child of 11 and power fell into the hands of the widow of King Yeongjo, often known as Queen Dowager Kim or [[Queen Jeongsun]]. Her family belonged to the factions opposed to the reformist, often Catholic, Nam-in group and she had been completely powerless during Jeongjo's reign. She at once launched an attack on the Catholics, who were denounced as traitors and enemies of the state. Jeong Yak-jong was the head of the Catholic community, he was one of the first to be arrested and executed, together with [[Yi Seung-hun]], in the spring of 1801. His eldest son, Jeong Cheol-sang, died then too, executed a month after his father.

Since he was Jeong Yak-jong's younger brother, Jeong Yakyong was sent into exile for some months in Janggi fortress in what is now [[Pohang]], having been found after interrogation with torture not to be a Catholic believer. That might have been that, but what brought Yakyong to [[Gangjin]], where he was forced to spend eighteen years, was the event that served as the final nail in the coffin of the early Catholic community, the Silk Letter Incident. Hwang Sa-yeong, married to one of Dasan's younger sisters, hid in a cave during the persecutions and in October 1801 he finished writing a long letter to the bishop of Beijing, giving a detailed account of the recent events, asking him to bring pressure on the Korean authorities to allow freedom of religion and, disastrously, begging him to ask the Western nations to send a large army to overthrow the Joseon dynasty so that Korea would be subject to China, where Catholicism was permitted. The man carrying this letter, written on a roll of silk wrapped round his body, was intercepted and the Korean authorities made full use of it to show that Catholics were by definition enemies of the state.

The persecution was intensified and if it had not been very clear that Jeong Yakyong and Jeong Yak-jeon were in no sense Catholic believers, they would surely have been executed. Instead they were sent into exile together, parting ways at [[Naju]], from where Jeong Yak-jeon journeyed on to the island of [[Heuksando]], Yakyong taking the Gangjin road. His exile began in the last days of 1801, on the 23rd day of the eleventh lunar month, the 28th of December in the solar calendar. On that day, he arrived in Gangjin, South Jeolla Province. The newly arrived exile had little or no money and no friends, he found shelter in the back room of a poor, rundown tavern kept by a widow, outside the East Gate of the walled township of Gangjin, and there he lived until 1805. He called his room “Sauijae” (room of four obligations: clear thinking, serious appearance, quiet talking, sincere actions).

By 1805, much had changed in Seoul. Dowager Queen Kim had died and the young king had come of age and quickly put an end to the violence against Catholics. Three hundred had been killed and many of the rest were exiled or scattered, or had stopped practicing. Jeong Yakyong was free to move about the Gangjin area and in the spring of 1805 he walked up the hill as far as Baeknyeon-sa Temple, where he met the Venerable Hyejang, the newly arrived monk in charge of the temple, who was about ten years younger than himself. They talked and it seems that Hyejang only realized who his visitor was as he was leaving. That night he forced him to stay with him and asked to learn the [[I Ching]] from him. They quickly became close companions.

Later the same year, Hyejang enabled Dasan to move out of the tavern and for nearly a year he lived in Boeun Sanbang, a small hermitage at the nearby Goseong-sa temple, which was under Hyejang's control. Finally, in the spring of 1808 he was able to take up residence in a house belonging to a distant relative of his mother, on the slopes of a hill overlooking Gangjin and its bay. It was a simple house, with a thatched roof, but it was there that the exile spent the remaining ten years of his exile, until the autumn of 1818. This is the site now known as “Dasan Chodang.” The hill behind the house was known locally as Da-san (tea-mountain) and that was to become the name by which our exile is best known today, Dasan. Here he could teach students who lodged in a building close to his, forming a close-knit community, and he could write. In his study he accumulated a library of over a thousand books.&lt;ref&gt;Setton, Mark. Chong Yakyong. page 63&lt;/ref&gt;

During his exile he is said to have written 500 volumes. This needs qualifying, since one “work” might fill nearly 50 volumes of the standard size, but he certainly wrote a vast quantity, some 14,000 pages, mainly in order to set out clearly a fundamental reform program for governing the country correctly according to Confucian ideals. During the years of exile he concentrated first on the ''Book of Changes'' ([[Yi Ching]]), writing in 1805 the ''Chuyeoksajeon''. A reflection on the [[Classic of Poetry]] followed in 1809. He wrote on politics, ethics, economy, natural sciences, medicine and music. After his return from exile, Dasan published his most important works: on jurisprudence ''Heumheumsinseo'' (1819); on linguistics ''Aeongakbi'' (1819); on diplomacy ''Sadekoryesanbo'' (1820); on the art of governing ''Mongminsimseo'' and on administration ''Gyeongsesiryeong'' (1822).

Dasan remained in exile in Gangjin until 1818, when he was allowed to return to his family home near Seoul. Attempts to bring him back into government service were blocked by factional politics. He used Yeoyudang as his final pen-name, it was the name of the family home where he lived quietly, near the Han River, until he died in  1836, on his sixtieth wedding anniversary. The main sources for his biography are the two versions of his own ‘epitaph,’ ''Jachan myojimyeong'', and a chronological biography ''Saam seonsaeng yeonbo'' composed by his great-grandson Jeong Gyu-yeong using no longer extant records.&lt;ref&gt;Setton, Mark. Chong Yakyong. page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dasan and the 19th-century tea revival==
Jeong Yakyong had been living in Gangjin for several years when the Ven. Hyejang arrived from Daeheung-sa temple to take charge of Paengnyeon-sa. During those years, spent in a poor inn with very little money, Dasan's health had suffered from the low nutritional value of his food. He suffered from chronic digestive problems. Dasan and Hyejang first met on the 17th day of the 4th month, 1805, not long after Hyejang's arrival. Only a few days after, Dasan sent a poem to Hyejang requesting some tea leaves from the hill above the temple; it is dated in the 4th month of 1805, very soon after their meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Min:Joseonui Chamunhwa p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

This poem makes it clear that Dasan already knew the medicinal value of tea and implies that he knew how to prepare the leaves for drinking. It has often been claimed that Dasan learned about tea from Hyejang but this and a series of other poems exchanged between them suggests that in fact Hyejang and other monks in the region learned how to make a kind of caked tea from Dasan.

This would make him the main origin of the ensuing spread of interest in tea. In 1809, the Ven. [[Cho-ui]] from the same Daeheung-sa temple came to visit Dasan in Gangjin and spent a number of months studying with him there.&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Min:Joseonui Chamunhwa p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Again, it seems more than likely that Cho-ui first learned about tea from Dasan, and adopted his very specific, rather archaic way of preparing caked tea. After that, it was the Ven. Cho-ui who, during his visit to Seoul in 1830, shared his tea with a number of scholars. Among them, some poems were written and shared to celebrate the newly discovered drink, in particular the ''Preface and Poem of Southern Tea'' (南茶幷序) by Geumryeong Bak Yeong-bo.&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Min:Joseonui Chamunhwa p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, Cho-ui became especially close to Chusa [[Kim Jeong-hui]], who visited him several times bringing him gifts of tea during his exile in Jeju Island in the 1740s. A letter about Dasan's method of making caked tea has survived, dated 1830, that Dasan sent to Yi Si-Heon 李時憲 (1803–1860), the youngest pupil taught by him during his 18 years of exile in Gangjin: “It is essential to steam the picked leaves three times and dry them three times, before grinding them very finely. Next that should be thoroughly mixed with water from a rocky spring and pounded like clay into a dense paste that is shaped into small cakes. Only then is it good to drink.”&lt;ref&gt;Brother Anthony etc:Korean Tea Classics page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==
Jeong is well-known above all for his work in synthesizing the Neo-Confucian thought of the middle [[Joseon dynasty]].{{ref|lee1}}  In the process, he wrote widely in various fields including law, political theory, and the [[Korean Confucian]] classics. He sought to return [[Korean Confucian]] scholarship to a direct connection with the original thought of [[Confucius]]. He called this return to the classics "Susa" learning (수사, 洙泗), a reference to the two rivers that flowed through Confucius' homeland.{{ref|lee2}}

Jeong published a number of books over various areas, including his best-known ''Mokminsimseo'' (목민심서, 牧民心書, The Mind of Governing the People). Although he was deeply concerned about the problem of poverty during that time, Jeong deeply pondered the issue of poverty and raised questions about the role of government officials. He believed that the government and bureaucrats could and should play a major role in solving the problem of poverty. Dasan stressed the importance of the governor's administering the people with integrity and in a fair manner. According to him, the government was the ruling entity to render aid and favor to the people while the people were the subject of the government's sympathy and rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eng.cfe.org/mboard/bbsDetail.asp?cid=mn2007713123749&amp;pn=3&amp;idx=971 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725153902/http://eng.cfe.org/mboard/bbsDetail.asp?cid=mn2007713123749&amp;pn=3&amp;idx=971 |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the service of this idea, Jeong criticized the philosophers of his time for engaging in both fruitless [[etymology|etymological]] scholarship and pursuing philosophical theory for their own sake.{{ref|lee3}} He argued that scholarship should be re-focused on more important concerns such as music, ritual, and law. This was not only an intellectual but also a political assertion: he argued that the [[gwageo]] examinations by which people qualified for royal service should be reformed to focus on these concerns.{{ref|choe1}}

===''Ye'' Philosophy===
Ye philosophy takes up a large portion of the writings of Jeong Yakyong. As demonstrated by the fact that the original title of ''Gyeongse Yupyo'' (경세유표, 經世遺表, Design for Good Government), a flagship work of his which presents a blueprint of state management, was ''Bangnye Chobon'' (Draft for the Country's Rites), Jeong uses the concept of ''Ye'' extensively to represent what he aims to achieve with his thought. He focuses this concept on his notion of good government and later extended and branched into his works of classical studies and natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:QBlEV3IADmcJ:www.ekoreajournal.net/upload/pdf/PDF4948+Jeong+Yakyong+idea&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShJFLe6lO7AHd3Kt6-jTjJ30D3F49-bS5op5VvY0DNk7A6_LfgGmdxjtAX25SJ-rchyxVNGnRvzSuqbrAAC5aR3FvDIgMxcYT1oW_FPXGiaXefGsUoyX7GJANwMzwtSMuE_Mkn4&amp;sig=AHIEtbSOPybiHQgT7Pl-orGGvncRRQoQ-A&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of Sacrificial Rites===
Dasan's theory of [[Jesa|Korean-style sacrificial rites]] (제사, 祭祀) shows his socio-political concern seeking for the rule of virtue and righteous government. He intended to motivate people into making everyday practices of the human imperatives and to revitalize effectively the traditional society of the late period of Joseon dynasty which had its basis upon Ye (禮, Confucian order). In ''Mokminsimseo'', Dasan formulates the cognitive process of ritual practice focussing on sacrificial rites as follows.

1) The cognition of the ritual object raises the intentional movement of mind/heart toward the ritual object in the cognitive process.

2) The intentionality of mind and heart entails reverence and purification in the ritual process. Ritual practice is significant through sincerity (성, 誠) and seriousness (경, 敬). From the perspective of the cognitive science of religion, Dasan's theory relates cognition with intentional piety in the cognitive process, and combines intentional piety and reverence/purification in ritual practice. Dasan intended to regulate the excessive ritual practices of the literati and restrict popular licentious cults (음사, 淫祀) in accordance with his cognitive formula. From his point of view, Confucianist's ritual conceptions were improper or impractical, and popular licentious cults were impious and overly enthusiastic. In order to solve these problems, He redefined Zhi Hsi's concept of seriousness as attentive concentration of convergent piety into the concept of prudential reverence as intentional pietism. Zhi Hsi's concept of seriousness contains apophatic mysticism like Zen Buddhist Quietism (정, 靜) by mediation, but Dasan's concept of reverence is inclined towards [[Cataphatic]] activism by contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=박종천 (Jong Chun Park)|year=2006|title=다산의 제사관 -『목민심서』 「예전」 "제사"조를 중심으로- (Tasan's theory of sacrificial rites -in the case of Mokminsimseo-)|journal=다산학 |volume=9|pages=81&amp;ndash;122}}

===Land reform===
Land reform was an important issue for the [[Silhak]] reformers, and Dasan elaborated upon Yu Hyŏngwŏn's land reform proposals. Rather than central state ownership, Dasan proposed a "village land system," in which the village would hold its land in common and farm the land as a whole, while the products of the land would be divided based on the amount of labor contributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Transforming Korean Politics: Democracy, Reform, and Culture|author=Kihl, Young Whan|year=2004|publisher=M.E.

==Views on Dasan==
Professor Ogawa Haruhisa of Nishogakusha University in Tokyo is very impressed by Dasan:

“In addition to egalitarian ideas, Chông Yag-yong Dasan provided something precious that had been lost at that time. He has these elements that we must learn and revive in these modern times. He formed his philosophy despite his sufferings in exile. I think he will be of interest to contemporary scholars for a long time.”{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Professor Peng Lin at Qinghua University, Beijing teaches the Chinese classics and has a special interest in Dasan's study of rituals. He published in the 1980s research papers on Dasan in the Sônggyun’gwan Journal of East Asian Studies:

“Dasan devoted great efforts in studying rites, to understanding and bringing recognition to traditional culture. I believe that Dasan’s study of rites is highly unique. He studied all the three fields in the study of ritual and this was not common even among Chinese scholars. Many can achieve only partial understanding even after a lifetime study, but Dasan studied all the ritual fields and his research is truly astounding. He wanted to create an ideal society by starting with what already existed. This shows Dasan’s humanistic interest and that intrigues me.”{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Professor Don Baker at the Asia Center of the University of British Columbia, Canada, is interested in Dasan for his role as an intellectual in a period of transition:

“I think that in the twenty-first century we still need to adopt Dasan’s spirit, what I call moral pragmatism. He was a very pragmatic man. He looked at problems and said ‘how can we solve them’. But also he always kept his moral values at the front. We often have in society a material progress for the sake of material progress. Dasan wanted a material progress but a progress that creates a more moral society, therefore I call it moral pragmatism and I think that we still need such spirit today."{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

There is in Korea a revival of Jeong Yakyong's thought never seen before on that scale for any Korean philosopher. In the not distant past one could hear doubts about even the existence of a Korean philosophy. Since the liberation of Korea in 1945 Western philosophy has prevailed and philosophy departments in most Korean universities teach mainly European modern philosophy. Therefore, Dasan is of great importance as he was able to be enthusiastic for modern Western ideas but remained deeply committed to the depth of Confucianism. He was not defending a tradition for its own sake but wanted to keep the precious values of the early Chinese period because it was a foundation for man and society.

'''Joseph Butler''' (18 May 1692 – 16 June 1752) was an [[English (people)|English]] [[bishop]], [[Christian theology|theologian]], [[apologist]], and [[philosopher]]. He was born in [[Wantage]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Berkshire]] (now [[Oxfordshire]]). He is known, among other things, for his critique of [[Deism]], [[Thomas Hobbes]]'s [[Ethical egoism|egoism]], and [[John Locke]]'s theory of [[personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph Butler (1692—1752)|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/butler/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler influenced many philosophers and religious thinkers, including [[David Hume]], [[Thomas Reid]], [[Adam Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;White (2006), §8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Sidgwick]],&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Schneewind, ''Sidgwick's Ethics and Victorian Moral Philosophy''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Henry Newman]],&lt;ref&gt;John Henry Cardinal Newman, ''Apologia Pro Vita Sua''. New York: Modern Library, 1950, p. 41.

Originally published in 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely considered "as one of the preeminent English moralists."&lt;ref&gt;James C. Livingston, ''Modern Christian Thought''. New York: Macmillan, 1971, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; He also played an important, though under appreciated, role in the development of eighteenth-century economic discourse, greatly influencing the Anglican Dean of Gloucester and political economist [[Josiah Tucker]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Xavier Price, 'LIBERTY, POVERTY AND CHARITY IN THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF JOSIAH TUCKER AND JOSEPH BUTLER', ''Modern Intellectual History'' (2017), 1-30. doi:10.1017/S1479244317000518. https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-intellectual-history/article/liberty-poverty-and-charity-in-the-political-economy-of-josiah-tucker-and-joseph-butler/E3B56A0D455E3AD634E53901B95C3318#fndtn-information&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
The son of a [[Presbyterian]] linen-draper, he was destined for the ministry of that church and, along with future archbishop [[Thomas Secker]], entered [[Samuel Jones (academy tutor)|Samuel Jones]]'s [[dissenter|dissenting]] academy at Gloucester (later Tewkesbury) for that purpose. While there, he entered into a secret correspondence with the distinguished Anglican theologian and philosopher [[Samuel Clarke]]. In 1714, Butler decided to enter the [[Church of England]], and went to [[Oriel College]], [[Oxford]]. He received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1718 and later proceeded [[Doctor of Civil Law]] on 8 December 1733.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

==Church career==
Butler was ordained a deacon on 26 October 1718 by [[William Talbot (bishop)|William Talbot]], [[Bishop of Salisbury]], in his Bishop's Palace, Salisbury, his palace chapel&lt;ref&gt;{{CCEd |type=ordination |id=26955 |name=Butler, Joseph |accessed=5 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a priest on 21 December  1718 by Talbot at [[St James's Church, Piccadilly]].&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; After holding various other high positions, he became [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the rich living of [[Stanhope, County Durham]].

In 1736 he was made the [[Clerk of the Closet|head chaplain]] of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]'s wife [[Caroline of Ansbach|Caroline]], on the advice of [[Lancelot Blackburne]]. He was nominated [[Bishop of Bristol]] on 19 October 1738 and consecrated a bishop on 3 December 1738 at [[Lambeth Palace]] chapel. Remaining Bishop of Bristol, Butler was installed [[Dean of St Paul's]] on 24 May 1740; he kept that office until his translation to Durham.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; He is said (apocryphally) to have declined an offer to become the [[archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1747 but was appointed [[Clerk of the Closet]] to the king in 1746 (until 1752). He was translated to Durham by the [[Confirmation of bishops|confirmation]] of his [[Canonical election|election]] to that See in October 1750; he was then enthroned by proxy on 9 November 1750.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; He is buried in Bristol Cathedral.

==Attack on deism==
During his lifetime and for many years after his death, Butler was most famous for his ''Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed'' (1736), which, according to historian [[Will Durant]], "remained for a century the chief buttress of Christian argument against unbelief."&lt;ref&gt;Will and Ariel Durant, ''The Age of Voltaire''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1965, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; English deists such as [[John Toland]] and [[Matthew Tindal]] had argued that nature provides clear evidence of an intelligent designer and artificer, but they rejected orthodox Christianity because of the incredibility of miracles and the cruelties and contradictions contained in the Bible.

Butler's ''Analogy'' was one of many book-length replies to the deists, and it was long widely believed to be the most effective. Butler argued that nature itself was full of mysteries and cruelties, and thus shared the same alleged defects as the Bible. Arguing on empiricist grounds that all knowledge of nature and human conduct is merely probable, Butler then appealed to a series of patterns ("analogies") observable in nature and human affairs, which, in his judgment, make the chief teachings of Christianity likely true.

Butler's jiu-jitsu-like argumentative strategy was unusual and risky. Arguing that "because nature is a mess of riddles, we cannot expect revelation to be any clearer"&lt;ref&gt;Livingston, ''Modern Christian Thought'', p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; obviously invited the retort that then both deism and Christianity were irrational. Today, Butler ''Analogy'' is "now largely of historical interest,"&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Darwall, "Introduction" to Joseph Butler, ''Five Sermons''. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1983, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but his claim that probability is the guide to life would be endorsed by many contemporary philosophers.

==Ethics and moral psychology==
A Butler scholar, Stephen Darwall, wrote: "Probably no figure had a greater impact on nineteenth-century British moral philosophy than Butler."&lt;ref&gt;Darwall, "Introduction&lt;" p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Butler's chief target in the ''Sermons'' was [[Thomas Hobbes]] and the egoistic view of human nature he had defended in ''Leviathan'' (1651). Hobbes was a materialist who believed that science reveals a world in which all events are causally determined and in which all human choices flow unavoidably from whatever desire is most powerful in a person at a given time. Hobbes saw human beings as being violent, self-seeking, and power-hungry. On such a view, there was no place for genuine altruism or benevolence or any conception of morality as traditionally conceived.&lt;ref&gt;Darwall, "Introduction," p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Sermons'', Butler argues that human motivation is less selfish and more complex than Hobbes claimed. Butler maintains that the human mind is an organized hierarchy of a number of different impulses and principles, many of which are not fundamentally selfish. On the ground floor, so to speak, is a wide variety of particular emotions, appetites, and affections, such as hunger, anger, fear, and sympathy. They, in properly organized minds, are under the control of two superior principles: self-love (a desire to maximize one's own long-term happiness) and benevolence (a desire to promote the general happiness). The more general impulses are in turn subject to the highest practical authority in the human mind: moral conscience. Conscience, Butler claims, is an inborn sense of right and wrong, an inner light and monitor, is received from God.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, ''Five Sermons'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Conscience tells one to promote both the general happiness and personal happiness. Experience informs that the two aims largely coincide in the present life. For many reasons, Butler argues, unethical and self-centered people who care nothing for the public good are usually not very happy.

There are, however, rare cases where the wicked seem (for a time) to prosper. A perfect harmony of virtue and self-interest, Butler claimed, is guaranteed only by a just God, who, in the afterlife, rewards and punishes people as they deserve.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, ''Five Sermons'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Locke's theory of personal identity==
In Appendix 1 of the ''Analogy'', Butler offers a famous criticism of [[John Locke]]'s influential theory of "personal identity", an explanation of what makes someone the "same person" from one time to the next, despite all the physical and psychological changes experienced over that period. Locke claimed that personal identity is not from having the same body or the same soul but from having the same consciousness and memory. According to Locke, memory is the "glue" that ties the various stages of our life together and constitutes sameness of person.

More precisely, Locke claims, Person A is the same person as Person B just in case A and B share at least some of the same memories. Butler pointed out that the way "real" memories can be distinguished from false ones is that it was people who had the experiences that are truly remembered. Thus, Butler claimed, memory presupposes personal identity and so cannot constitute it.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Butler, ''The Analogy of Religion''. Cincinnati: Jennings and Graham, 1847. p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Butler died in 1752 at Rosewell House, [[Kingsmead Square, Bath|Kingsmead Square]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Somerset]].&lt;ref name="rosewell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=442757|title=Rosewell House|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His admirers praise him as an excellent man, and a diligent and conscientious churchman. Though indifferent to general literature, he had some taste in the fine arts, especially architecture.

In the [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|calendars of the Anglican communion]] his feast day is 16 June.

He has his own collection of manuscripts (e.g. [[Lectionary 189]]).

'''Krotona''' was one of three important [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] centers in the United States during the early part of the 20th century. Originally built in [[Hollywood]] during 1912, the colony was eventually relocated to [[Ojai]], [[California]] in 1926, where it operates today as the '''Krotona Institute of Theosophy'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corbu2.caed.kent.edu/architronic/v8n1/v8n106.pdf |title=A Survey of Surviving Buildings of the Krotona Colony in Hollywood |accessdate=2007-10-07 |last= Willis |first= Alfred |publisher=University of California, Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Located just off of [[California State Route 33|State Route 33]], the Krotona Institute holds regular classes and workshops on Theosophy, maintains an extensive library on the occult, and has a small bookstore.

The Hollywood Krotona building located at Primrose and Vista Del Mar was erected in 1919.&lt;ref name="Meares 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Meares | first=Hadley | title=The Creation of Beachwood Canyon's Theosophist "Dreamland" | website=Curbed LA | date=2014-05-22 | url=https://la.curbed.com/2014/5/22/10099768/the-creation-of-beachwood-canyons-theosophist-dreamland-1 | access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tenants have included Annie Sullivan Knudsen (sugar cane heiress), New Yorker Grace Shaw Duff, Henry Hotchener, [[Marie Russak]], silver screen stars [[Mary Astor]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]], and record producer Joshua Rumer of Invengo Records. When the Krotonians, spurred by [[Madame Blavatsky]], found Hollywood suffocating their peace-filled theosophies, they decided to move to Ojai California and that is where they have been ever since.

It was about a year before the Primrose building went up that [[Alice Bailey]], subsequently a Theosophical and Spiritualist leader and author, moved to a "cottage on Beechwood Drive," to be near the Krotona colony, from Pacific Grove, CA, near Monterey.  She had joined the Theosophical Lodge in Pacific Grove and was teaching and holding classes.  Not long before, she tells, she had left her original traditional Christian beliefs behind and soon after "discovered" "that there was a great and divine Plan," and that there are those "who are responsible for the working out of that Plan" by leading mankind, "stage by stage," down the centuries.  This "hierarchy of spiritual leaders" she calls the "Masters of the Wisdom," and they all report to and work with Christ, Jesus of Nazareth.  Her own Master, Lord K. H. or Koot Hoomi, had made visits to her every few years, starting she said in 1895, this being one of his many duties in his role as a pupil or assistant to the Christ.  K. H. was a master of love-wisdom.  Bailey said about 500 people were then part of the Krotona community, some living on the premises, and she began work there by emptying the garbage.  Soon she worked in the vegetarian kitchen and noted that some of the vegetarians felt smugly superior to carnivores, while others had no such notions.  She remained with the Theosophical Society until 1920.&lt;ref name="Bailey 1951"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=Alice |title=The unfinished autobiography of Alice A.

      <comment>Corrected title of Lacan's "The signification of the phallus" (I.e. not "the significance of the phallus") and added reference for his Écrits</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4689">In [[Jacques Lacan]]'s [[psychoanalytic]] [[philosophy]], '''lack''' ({{lang-fr|manque}}) is a concept that is always related to desire. In his seminar ''Le transfert'' (1960–61) he states that lack is what causes desire to arise.

==Types of lack==
Lacan first designated a lack of [[being]]: what is desired is being itself. "Desire is a relation to being to lack. The lack is the lack of being properly speaking. It is not the lack of this or that, but lack of being whereby the being exists." (Seminar: ''The Ego in Freud's Theory'') In "The Direction of the Treatment and the Principles of Its Power" (''Écrits'') Lacan argues that desire is the [[metonymy]] of the lack of being (''manque à être''): the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]'s lack of being is at the heart of the analytic experience and the very field in which the [[neuroticism|neurotic]]'s passion is deployed. In "Guiding Remarks for a Convention on Feminine Sexuality" Lacan contrasts the lack of being related to desire with the lack of having (''manque à avoir'') which he relates to demand.

Starting in his seminar ''La relation d'objet'', Lacan distinguishes between three kinds of lack, according to the nature of the object which is lacking. The first one is [[The Symbolic|Symbolic]] [[Castration]] and its object related is the '''[[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|Imaginary]] [[Phallus#In Psyhchoanalysis|Phallus]]'''; the second one is Imaginary Frustration and its object related is the '''Real Breast'''; the third kind of lack is Real Privation and its object related is the '''Symbolic Phallus'''. The three corresponding agents are the Real Father, the Symbolic Mother, and the Imaginary Father. Of these three forms of lack, castration is the most important from the perspective of the cure.

It is in ''La relation d'objet'' that Lacan introduces the algebraic symbol for the barred [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], and lack comes to designate the lack of the signifier in the Other. Then the relation of the subject to the lack of the signifier in the Other, designates the signifier of a lack in the Other. No matter how many [[Sign (semiotics)|signifiers]] one adds to the signifying chain, the chain is always incomplete, it always lacks the signifier that could complete it. This missing signifier is then constitutive of the subject.

==Lack of phallus==
The symbolic version of the phallus, a phallic symbol is meant to represent male generative powers. According to Sigmund Freud's theory of psychoanalysis, while males possess a penis, no one can possess the symbolic phallus. Jacques Lacan's ''Écrits'' includes an essay titled ''The Signification of the Phallus'' which articulates the difference between "being" and "having" the phallus. Men are positioned as men insofar as they are seen to have the phallus. Women, not having the phallus, are seen to "be" the phallus. The symbolic phallus is the concept of being the ultimate man, and having this is compared to having the divine gift of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Écrits|last=Lacan|first=Jacques|publisher=Tavistock Publications|year=1977|isbn=|location=London|pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Gender Trouble|''Gender Trouble'' (1990)]], [[Judith Butler]] explores Freud's and Lacan's discussions of the symbolic phallus by pointing out the connection between the phallus and the penis. She writes, "The law requires conformity to its own notion of 'nature'. It gains its legitimacy through the binary and asymmetrical naturalization of bodies in which the phallus, though clearly not identical to the penis, deploys the penis as its naturalized instrument and sign" (135). In ''Bodies that Matter'', she further explores the possibilities for the phallus in her discussion of the lesbian phallus. If, as she notes, Freud enumerates a set of analogies and substitutions that rhetorically affirm the fundamental transferability of the phallus from the penis elsewhere, then any number of other things might come to stand in for the phallus (62).

==Criticism==
In ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'', [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] postulate that desire does not arise from lack, but rather is a productive force in itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12145">'''Laura Bentivolgio Davia''' (1689-1761) was an aristocratic women in the eighteenth century that engaged in  the pursuit of knowledge and natural philosophy in Italy. She was known primarily  for creating relationships with leading natural philosophers associated with the [[University of Bologna]] and the [[Istituto delle Scienze]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knott|first1=Sarah|last2=Taylor|first2=Barbara|title=Women, Gender, and Enlightenment.]|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|page=724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Years ==
Laura and her sister were the last direct descendants of the [[Bentivoglio family]] that ruled over [[Bologna]] before their exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knott|first1=Sarah|last2=Taylor|first2=Barbara|title=Women, Gender, and Enlightenment.]|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|page=724}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1708, she married Francesco Davia (1677-1753), an ex-soldier,  against her family wishes, and their relationship lasted until 1715-1726. Most of her life however, she lived with her husband's uncle. cardinal Giovan Antonio Davia in [[Rimini]]. There she was educated by the Riminese physician [[Giovanni Bianchi]] in modern philosophy, and became involved in Cardinal Davia's scientific academy

== Development of a Woman Philosopher==
Francesco Davia played a major part in Laura's development into  a philosopher. Francesco was unsure about Laura's love towards him. He would go to such extremes such as challenging men who have talked to Laura. He went so far as to dress up as a priest to listen for a confession to find out if she was unlawful. He was caught and the event led him incarcerated for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knott|first1=Sarah|last2=Taylor|first2=Barbara|title=Women, Gender, and Enlightenment.]|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was in jail in 1711, she traveled back home with her son to separate from Francesco. When her husband was released from jail in 1715, he brought his unlawful wife's actions to [[Pope Benedict XIV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Messbarger|first1=Rebecca|last2=Johns|first2=Christopher|last3=Gavitt|first3=Philip|title=Benedict XIV and the Enlightenment|date=2016|publisher=University of Toronto Press|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Govoni|first1=Paola|last2=Zelda|first2=Alice|title=Writing about Lives in Science: (auto)biography, Gender, and Genre|date=2014|publisher=V&amp;r Unipress|location=Göttingen|pages=96,103,115}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had three choices, wither return to her husband, enter a monastery, or live with her husband's uncle Giovanni Antonio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knott|first1=Sarah|last2=Taylor|first2=Barbara|title=Women, Gender, and Enlightenment.]|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, she chose to live with Giovanni Antonio where she began her steps to become a philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knott|first1=Sarah|last2=Taylor|first2=Barbara|title=Women, Gender, and Enlightenment.]|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|pages=273–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;
b. Davia was the queen of aristocratic woman who were attracted to philosophy in the beginning of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knott|first1=Sarah|last2=Taylor|first2=Barbara|title=Women, Gender, and Enlightenment.]|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|pages=260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Italian women philosophers of that era were independent, those that had rebellious minds had were fighting for social freedoms. During her stay with her uncle, she participated in some of the most interesting philosophical debates during that period.

== Education ==
To start, Davia immersed herself in her uncle's library. Women were not ridiculed for learning but encouraged in the philosophical community. Many scholars were eager to tutor aristocratic women in sciences. One of these tutors was the physician  [[Giovanni Bianchi]](1693-1775). Laura was Giovanni's only female student, learning under his household which focused on scientific and philosophical learning. As Bianchi's intellectual credibility rose, so did his school and their knowledge branched out to questioning astronomy and philosophy to problems in anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knott|first1=Sarah|last2=Taylor|first2=Barbara|title=Women, Gender, and Enlightenment.]|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the history of Biachi's schools activities and accomplishments are lost, however Davia's history can be retraced. As she grew as a philosopher over the years, she had been praised and gossiped about during the eighteenth century. For instance, [[Francesco Maria Zanotti]] wrote a poem about her, praising the philosopher and declaring that no woman in history would be able to accomplish what she had done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knott|first1=Sarah|last2=Taylor|first2=Barbara|title=Women, Gender, and Enlightenment.]|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, he also became one of her other tutors. In Zatnotti's opinion, he characterized her as independent, yet strong headed because of her disdain for male philosophers when debating them. In addition, her popularity was so widespread that her name was heard outside of Rimini. Her studies and her philosophical education had paid off, gaining recognition from the highest of nobility. She was one of the few women philosophers that had her own opinions and was able to debate with male philosophers on an equal platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knott|first1=Sarah|last2=Taylor|first2=Barbara|title=Women, Gender, and Enlightenment.]|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|pages=277–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Findlen|first1=Paula|last2=Wendy Wassyng|first2=Roworth|last3=Sama|title=Italy's Eighteenth Century: Gender and Culture in the Age of the Grand Tour.|date=2009|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|pages=235–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davia was a firm advocate of not only Cartesian philosophy which was focused as the mind and body were separate. But also Cartesian science but with conversations with colleagues, her opinion began to solidify towards its Newtonian counterpart, which focused on planetary motions and the possibility of a vacuum, also on the different aspects of human beings, including the psyche, and how nature reflects its divine creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Janiak|first1=Andrew|title="Newton's Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/newton-philosophy|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1730s, Bentivoglio Davia was able to firmly establish her reputation as the leading female patron of science in the City of Bologna. She was unmoved by the results of Newton physics and her stance towards it was firmly cemented because her "rival" Bassi supported it.

== Laura Bentivolgio vs Laura Bassi ==
During the spring of 1732, Laura Bassi started to gain momentum in the philosophy community. [[Laura Bassi]](1711–78), became the first woman to graduate from the University of Bologna and later the first woman to hold a university chair in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knott|first1=Sarah|last2=Taylor|first2=Barbara|title=Women, Gender, and Enlightenment.]|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bentivolgio was annoyed of her success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knott|first1=Sarah|last2=Taylor|first2=Barbara|title=Women, Gender, and Enlightenment.]|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|pages=265–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her criticisms of Bassi were spread throughout the community that the community took offense. She had to make a public apology because she feared that she would be stoned by her fellow citizens for not accepting Bassi. Due to the changes of Italian philosophy and education in the eighteenth century, it forced Davia's hand to reject Bassi and her views. In addition, Davia was backing [[Cartesian philosophy]]. She belonged to an international community of learned women who earned the approval of the [[Republic of Letters]] in the preceding century who previously included such people like Princess [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Elisabeth of Bohemia]] and [[Queen Christina of Sweden]]. Between the two there is a generation gap therefore they couldn't see eye to eye. Also, because Bassi wasn't an aristocrat, she was garnering more praise from critics than Bentivolgio which fueled her resentment towards Bassi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knott|first1=Sarah|last2=Taylor|first2=Barbara|title=Women, Gender, and Enlightenment.]|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|pages=260, 261, 265–269, 279–281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reputation ==
Her reputation as a philosopher was hard to maintain. Her unwillingness to accept Laura Bassi's ability hurt her status as a philosopher,  and she gained less recognition over the years because of her arrogance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knott|first1=Sarah|last2=Taylor|first2=Barbara|title=Women, Gender, and Enlightenment.]|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike  Bassi, she was not admitted in Bologna Academy of Sciences, and  could only attend those debates that was available to the public&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knott|first1=Sarah|last2=Taylor|first2=Barbara|title=Women, Gender, and Enlightenment.]|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Laura Bassi took Davia's position as a philosopher,  Davia changed her status  to becoming a patron of philosophy. She engaged in philosophical correspondence and asked questions about multiple natural phenomenas from the concept of light and electricity to why one person wears three pairs of socks. Because her position was lost, its a possibility that she was barred from participating from philosophical discussions, to the point that she had to demand what were the new topics were from other philosophers whether they be of high status or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knott|first1=Sarah|last2=Taylor|first2=Barbara|title=Women, Gender, and Enlightenment.]|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;    During the late 1740s and 1750s, Davia became ill that her tutor Bianchi took the role as her physician. She gave him details of her physical condition and home-remedies that she'd tried. Essentially she became a experimental test subject, being analyzed by the medical community of Bologna until her death in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knott|first1=Sarah|last2=Taylor|first2=Barbara|title=Women, Gender, and Enlightenment.]|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|page=281,724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonardo Polo''' (February 1, 1926 – February 9, 2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diariodenavarra.es/noticias/navarra/mas_navarra/2013/02/09/fallece_leonardo_polo_profesor_universidad_navarra_107011_2061.html |title=Fallece a los 87 años Leonardo Polo, catedrático de la UN |publisher=Diariodenavarra.es |date=2013-02-09 |accessdate=2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a renowned Spanish philosopher best known for his philosophical method called ''abandonment of the mental limit'' and the profound philosophical implications and results of the application of this method.

This method of  ''detecting the mental limit in conditions such that it can be abandoned'', results in a rethinking of classical and modern themes that opens up a wide range of philosophical fields. Principal among these are: (1) the act of being of the physical universe (''[[metaphysics]]''); (2) the quadruple con-causality (or essence) of the physical universe (''[[philosophy of nature]]''); (3) the act of being of the human person (''transcendental anthropology'');  (4) the manifestation of the human person through her essence (''anthropology of the human essence'').

In addition to this, his works cover a wide range of fields including [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[philosophy of science]], [[philosophy of language]], [[social ethics]], [[political economy]] and [[business theory]].

Throughout his more than forty books, Polo engages with both Classical  and Medieval thinkers such as [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[William of Ockham]], as well as Modern and Contemporary philosophers such as [[Descartes]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Hegel]], [[Husserl]], [[Heidegger]], and [[Nietzsche]].

In dialogue with the great thinkers of the history of philosophy, Polo seeks to further the achievements of traditional philosophy as well as rectify and correct the project of [[Modern philosophy]].

Already during his lifetime, interest in his philosophy has given rise to numerous conferences and study workshops, including two international congresses; the publication of more than twenty books and 200 scholarly articles; dozens of doctoral dissertations; and two philosophical Journals dedicated specially to his thought.

==Life==

===Early life (1926–1949)===

Leonardo Polo was born in [[Madrid]], February 1, 1926. He attended elementary school at the French High School (Liceo francés) of Madrid, and started his secondary education in Madrid, just as the Spanish Civil War was beginning in 1936. At this time, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], his father held the position of Vice-mayor of the city. When the Republican government urged civilian to leave the capital city of Spain, Polo's family moved to [[Albacete]], where he spent his first two years of secondary education. During the years 1936-1937, his father, a lawyer by profession, held the position of Chief Prosecutor for the city of Albacete. At the end of the Spanish Civil War, the family returned to Madrid, except for his father, who was forced into exile first to Nicaragua and then to Chile, where he died in 1946.

Upon the return of his family to Madrid, Leonardo Polo continued his secondary education at the Cardinal Cisneros Institute. However, the change of the 1934 plan of studies for that of 1938 forced him to repeat the second year of studies that he had already done in Albacete. During this period, he read the book ''Fundamental Philosophy'' by the Spanish philosopher [[Jaime Balmes]]. He was fifteen years old at the time. The basic idea that he drew from this work was of the importance of the first principles, that these could not just be one, and that philosophy must be understood from the point of view of these first principles (in a doctoral course about the Logos in 1995, he would say, "philosophy is the knowledge of principles by principles"). The importance given to the first principles then led him to the [[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]] of [[Thomas Aquinas]], and more specifically Question 45, which presents creation as an accidental relation. This led Polo think that Thomas Aquinas could be corrected and expanded on this point, since if creation has to do with what is first, if it is ''extra nihilum'', if created act of being is being insofar as being, then the relation with the Creator cannot be an accident, but rather a relation of principles. Polo would later make numerous references to Aquinas in his works, especially with regard to the real distinction between essence and act of being and the need to expand this distinction and apply it to the study of the human person in what Polo would eventually call a transcendental anthropology.

At school he also read [[Ortega y Gasset]], [[Aquinas]], and [[Xavier Zubiri]] (including the first edition of Naturaleza, Historia y Dios published in 1942). In later years, Polo would also be able to attend lectures by Zubiri on the concept in Madrid and another by Ortega y Gasset on [[Toynbee]].

After secondary school in 1945 and obtaining an extraordinary prize in the State exam, Polo decided to study law. This decision was influenced by family events. At the end of the Spanish Civil War, his uncle, Agustín Barrena, was left in charge of a law firm in which his father and his uncle Luis had once worked. A career in offered him the opportunity of joining the firm with his uncle and to continue a family tradition, in spite of his own personal inclinations toward more theoretical subjects, and more concretely, toward he study of mathematics. Mathematics did not, however, seem to have much of a future in a country that had just come out of a civil war. For this reason, he studied law for four years.

=== Discovery of the mental limit and early philosophical studies (1952–1966)===

In 1949, recently graduated, he started practicing law and, as he would later recount, he had to decide between making money by doing law (something which bored him) or to follow his inclinations toward theory and research. To his uncle's great disappointment, he chose the latter, and enrolled in doctoral courses of law. Of these course, he remembers the one given by García Valdecasas, professor of civil law, with whom he held conversations about Hegel. Upon finishing his doctoral course work, Polo was faced with the choice of doing a doctoral dissertation, but also with the problem of how to make a living during those years dedicated to research. One possibility was to seek a teaching position; and he in fact prepared for a few professorial exams even though in the end he did not pursue them. The topic of research that interested him was the development of an existential interpretation of natural right.
During this time his readings centered around [[Hegel]]'s [[Philosophy of Right]], [[Heidegger]]'s [[Being and Time]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s Critique of the Practical Reason, [[Spinoza']]s Ethics, as well as a number of works by [[Aristotle]] and [[Leibniz]]. It was at this time that Polo began enrolling in class of philosophy.

It was spring of 1950 when Polo became aware the existence of what he calls the mental limit. He describes detecting this limit in these terms:

:“… it suddenly occurred to me, period. I was thinking about thinking and being, and about what being had to do with thinking; then I realized that we cannot arrive at being if one does not abandon the supposition of the object, because the supposition makes the object limited and a limited knowledge cannot be a knowledge of being if this is taken in the transcendental sense.” (from an interview to Prof. Dr. Juan Cruz in “Anuario Filosófico” XXV/1 (1992), § 46. * https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181715/http://dspace.unav.es/handle/1721.1/687] You can read that interview here).

In other words, to become aware of the mental limit of the need to abandon it is to notice that 
:"one cannot separate, I repeat, being from being, it is not possible to take hold of it objectively because in this way it is "des-realized"; but if being is not real, it is nothing. The intentional consideration of being is a quid pro quo. Being agrees with itself, but, being known intentionaliter is, as the Scholastics would say, an extrinsic denomination. When I know the idea, I do not in any way affect what I know, because the idea of what I know is in my mind as intelligible in act and in reality as intelligible in potency. The real distinction between essence and being makes the question all the more serious, because if being and essence were the same, then knowing something of the essence would be knowing something of being." (from the same interview, § 47).

Polo describes his discovering in this way: i) "''A is A'', supposes A", and ii) "Thought being does not think". According to the first proposition, there is no intellectual increase in the reality of A when we think it objectively. Mental objects are invariably supposed. Following the tradition that comes from Medieval Philosophy, ''suppositio'' is the fact that the significative reference is not indefinite. In this way, the reference of A stops, because what is in the realm of the mind is A as an object. "A" is "already" thought, "A" is already "given", "there is already" A, "what is immediately open to a mental act is an object". That is the supposition of A. One can think more, better, but according to a new mental act. You cannot increase the intellection of A with the same act you have already thought. That act stops in A. The act does not prosecutes to new objectivity, in other words, a mental act always refers to an object, in which it ''stops''. According to this fact, says Polo, the [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]] of mental objects, and the [[hegel]]ian [[dialectic]] method are misguided attempts.

The second sentence "Thought being does not think" explains a different meaning of the mental limit.  While mental activity and objectivity are different, they are inseparable. Without the first one, there is no possibility of the second one: there is no way of finding an idea that could think itself. The intentionality of mental acts always refers to objects where it is impossible to find the known existence. This formulation involves a criticism to the [[subject-object]] [[Personal identity|identity]], and a rectification of [[Heidegger]]'s [[existentialism]].

After two years of basic course work in philosophy, Polo received an opportunity to continue work in his research regarding the existential character of natural right with a research fellowship in Rome that he received from the ''Higher Council for Scientific Research'' (headed at that time by Alvaro D'Ors), which had just started a branch in Rome (the ''Spanish Juridical Institute'' in Rome). 
In Rome he had contact with eminent jurists like Del Vecchio and Capograssi. During these years in Rome (from the end of 1952 to September 1954), Leonardo Polo continued to develop the insight that he had received in 1950. A first phase of this involved the topic of his doctoral dissertation, "The existential character of Natural Right." However, posing the topic of the existential character of law required resolving a series of more fundamental questions, many of which were related to the intuition of 1950 and which became a long introduction that eventually became a work in itself and which would lead to his research away from the juridical sciences and more toward philosophy.

Polo spent these Roman years reading, thinking intensely, and, above all, writing. German philosophy, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the [[German Romantics]], as well as [[Hegel]] and [[Heidegger]], whom he had already known in his younger years, were a major focus of his study during this time.  A result of the activity in Rome is a large volume titled ''The Real Distinction'', which he did not publish as such, but would later serve as a staging base for later publications.

The formulations that Leonardo Polo had made with regard to his 1950 intuition became more consistent through the intellectual dialogue with the [[Idealist]] philosophers and with Heidegger's existentialism. For example, Polo's reading of Heidegger and of his concern for the "existent", his critic of idealism and his philosophical approach, would lead Polo to his characterization of the human persons as "being additionally" [además]. This ''being additionally'', which according to Polo Heidegger did not see, expresses that the human person is not limited to her thinking, nor even to her acting, but rather ''is additionally'' to thinking and action. To ''be additionally'' is "to open oneself intimately to be always constantly overflowing" (La libertad, doctoral course, Pamplona, 1990, pro manuscripto).

In 1954, Polo returned from Rome and began working at the recently founded [[University of Navarre]], where he first taught ''Natural Law'' and then later (after the beginning of the School of Arts and Letters in 1956) ''Fundamentals of Philosophy'' and ''History of Philosophical Systems''. At the same time, he continued his studies of philosophy at the Central University in Madrid as an external student, since his work teaching at Navarre prevented him from attending class. Technical issues forced Polo to transfer his studies to the University of Barcelona. Here he finished a short research work on [[Karl Marx]]'s anthropology under the direction of Jorge Pérez Ballestar. After receiving his degree from Barcelona in 1959, Polo transferred back to Madrid for the doctoral program and began work on his doctoral dissertation with [[Antonio Millán-Puelles]].

In 1961, Polo obtained a doctoral degree after presenting his dissertation on [[Descartes]]. In this work, he presents Descartes as a voluntarist, something uncommon at the time for Spanish academic circles, who considered Descartes more as a rationalist. This dissertation was prepared for publication and appear under the title "Evidencia y realidad en Descartes" (''Evidence and Reality in Descartes'') in 1963.
At this time, as preparation for his application for academic positions at universities, Polo prepared a series of publications base on the thick volume ''The Real Distinction'', which he had written in Rome. Fruit of this work were ''El accesso al ser'' (''The Access to Being'') and ''El ser I'' (''Being I''), published in 1964 and 1966, respectively.

===Years of silence (1966–1982)===

Polo's first two books were, unfortunately, widely misunderstood in Spanish intellectual circles. Few were able to understand the complexity of the thematic and methodical dimensions of his proposal and its technical vocabulary. His assertion that freedom is a personal transcendental was also misunderstood. In doing so, some thought that Polo was a thinker on the Hegelian tradition.

Of the four thematic areas which he thought had become available when overcoming our mental limits, Polo only wrote about the first ("Being I: Extramental Existence"). The original plan consisted of four parts: "Being II" would have studied the extramental essence (analysis of the persistence of extramental being in four predicamentales causes); "Being III" would have studied the being of human person, and "Being IV" would have dealt with the essence of man. Nevertheless, he remained silence for fifteen years and did not publish anything aside from a couple of papers. These are years of intense study and exchanges with colleagues.

Polo taught at the University of Granada for two years (1966-1968). After that he moved back to the University of Navarra, where in 1972 he extensively revised Being III and Being IV, writing a new version of his Philosophical Anthropology, which also remained unpublished.

From 1978 he started teaching in universities of South and Central America every year. Polo understood that for those countries education was a means of finding a way out of poverty, mainly because without division of labour, which is central to any modern society, education becomes impossible. Hence he promoted research and high standards in teaching in every university of South and Central America which he visited. Universities that he more frequently visited include [[Universidad Panamericana]] in Mexico, [[Universidad de Piura]] in Peru, and [[Universidad de la Sabana]] in Colombia.

===Years of maturity (from 1982 to his death in 2013)===

In 1982 Polo broke his silence in a paper called "The intellectual and the intelligible". There he makes explicit the Aristotelian roots of his proposal, highlighting the continuity of his philosophy with the Aristotelian tradition. He saw it as a "continuation of the study of knowledge just at the stage in which Aristotle left it". To that aim he set out to write his ''Theory of Knowledge'' in 5 volumes, the last two of which correspond to Being II.

In 1999 and 2003 he published his third and definitive work on philosophical anthropology (the former Being III and IV from 1972, and the old "Real Distinction" from 1952 being the previous versions), which came to light under the title ''Transcendental Anthropology'' I (1999) and II (2003).

These years of maturity have seen the publication of more than twenty books in a varied range of topics. Polo continued working in Pamplona (Spain) until his death in 2013.

Different universities and institutions worldwide (like the "Institute of Philosophical Studies 'Leonardo Polo'" in Málaga (Spain)) have organized meetings and symposia about his thought, and research is conducted and being spread to the present throughout books and articles which find their inspiration in his work.

==Works==

His most important works are: ''Evidencia y realidad en Descartes'' (Evidence and Reality in Descartes), published in 1963, ''El acceso al ser,'' (Access to Being), in 1964, ''El ser I: La existencia extramental'' (Being I: Extramental Existence), in 1966, ''Curso de Teoría del Conocimiento,'' (Course of Theory of Knowledge), published in four volumes between 1984 and 1996), ''Hegel y el posthegelianismo'' (Hegel and Posthegelianism), in 1985, ''Antropología Trascendental I: La persona humana'' (Transcendental Anthropology I: Human Person), in 1999 and ''Antropología transcendental II: la esencia del hombre'' (Transcendental Anthropology II: Human Essence) in 2003.

===''El acceso al ser''===

This book expounds Polo's metaphysical method. Aristotle considered metaphysics the highest possible science because it deals with being, which is the ultimate constituent of everything. Modern metaphysicians, such as Descartes and Kant, understood that many of the pitfalls of metaphysics were caused by the lack of a rigorous method. Polo is sympathetic with Descartes and Kant about the need for such a method, but reflects that in metaphysics the method has to take us to grasp the being or existence of entities as such. If instead of that, our method leaves unresolved the question 'what is being?', its achievements will lead to perplexity. For Polo, such is the situation of Modern metaphysicians. When perplexed, the metaphysician finds himself in an awkward position, for he becomes blind to his own cognitive limits, and consequently has to put up with the suspicion that something in his system is missing without knowing exactly what.

Polo's response to perplexity gravitates on the need to overcome such limits. His method consists in acknowledging such limits without denying them. To take thinking to its limit is the only way in which this can be detected and laid bare for scrutiny. Only in that way such limits will become apparent to the philosopher. The task of ''El acceso al ser'' is to illuminate the mind's cognitive limits for knowing in such a way that these can be effectively overcome. He calls this method 'the abandonment of mental limit'.

With this a new and unsuspected perspective opens up. Being does not appear as perplexical as it might have appeared to philosophers like Hegel. The abandonment of the limit exposes the being of the universe as it is. This can be seen, on the one hand, as a kind of ''persistence''; on the other, as a principle of continuity which provides the basis for the principle of non-contradiction. But looking at the universe one does not know why things ''are'' in the first place or why it exists. The reason is that the universe depends on a different principle called ''identity'', and which is essentially God. Disconnect the world with that identity, and a large part of reality will lose its sense, for there is a third principle, the so-called ''transcendental causality'' which links up persistence and identity by placing the latter as creator of the former.

In this way, Polo thinks that ''Access to Being'' brings metaphysics back in its right historical track. Some medievals, and particularly Aquinas, conceived being as a transcendental, non-reducible notion. This method looks to do justice to their views.

===''Curso de Teoría del Conocimiento''===

This book is based on transcripts taken from the epistemology lectures which Polo delivered in the University of Navarra throughout the 80s, and that he corrected later on. The work contents are carefully distributed in four volumes, the last of which is divided in two parts. They are a much later and mature work in which Polo brings his discoveries in line with Aristotle's philosophy and sistematises his views for the first time.

Starting from [[perceptual knowledge]], it discusses internal faculties such as [[imagination]], the abstraction and the following steps to the highest [[cognitive]] level, which is [[rational knowledge]]. As part of his concern for the method, Polo formulates a number of axioms which specify what is a cognitive act. The first and most relevant of these is the 'axiom of the act', which establishes that knowledge is active, as a consequence of which knowledge is an intentional and perfect act. Knowledge secures that character over real and constitutive existing acts such as those constituting a planet or a tiny virus. Knowledge, following Aristotle, is ''energeia'' or perfect act which in itself does not consist in any kind of substance, nor fits into the categories of space and time, as all existing objects do (see [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|Aristotle's theory of potentiality and actuality]]).

Polo devises an epistemic difference between operations and habits of the mind. Habits are powerful cognitive acts which bring particular insights into real objects, whereas operations analyse and exploit the cognitive achievement of habits in successive stages as much as they can. As operations come to an end, only further habits can bring new light to them. In this way, the distinction between them grows bigger and more articulated the further the we progress beyond perceptual knowledge.

Habits are a direct exercise of the abandonment of the limit. While we all use some of them in ordinary life, i.e. so to be able to speak, not every one makes use of the highest available habits, which according to Polo illuminate unprecedented problems of philosophy such as the nature of first principles as examined in ''El acceso al ser''.

Yet habits are sustained by a good many operations. The distinction between operations and habits runs across all cognitive faculties and helps to bring concepts, linguistic and numerical abilities and judgements into a new light, out of which we know, i.e. that after the first abstracted object the path of reasoning faces a junction: it can either 'generalise', to organise [[abstract object]]s into families, as we do in any classification of items into categories and subcategories, or it can follow a 'rational' path, exploring thus the promising connection between concepts and reality in order to make a judgement upon the universal or particular nature of a thing.

Polo not only gives evidence of his views by discussing rival theories; he contrasts his views with that of Kant, Hegel and Heidegger. Kant's epistemology, while succeeding in systematising knowledge, presents perceptual knowledge as passive and so fails to comply with the requirements of axiom A, which asserts that knowledge is active. For Kant:

:"perceptual knowledge is passive and yet the intellect is active. But if the intellect is active and perception is passive, the relation between both, if active, must be transitive. A transitive movement has suddenly crept into knowledge (...) as a kind of ''actio in passo'', something which for Aristotle is paradigmatic of a physical action" (2nd ed. 1987, 70-1).

Similarly, the second volume of Polo's epistemology discusses a good deal of the concept of abstract objects for Heidegger, whereas the last volume explores the philosophical basis of 20th century physics.

===Transcendental Anthropology===

Polo had expressed in private conversations that his voluminous ''Theory of Knowledge'' had shed much light into his method, but that his work would be incomplete if he were not to canvass the habits which yield knowledge of the human essence and its singular act of being.

That is precisely the core of his Transcendental Anthropology ''(Antropología Trascendental)'', a science he believes is a transcendental philosophy of man – not taking 'transcendental' as synonym with ''a priori'' and opposed to 'empirical', as Kant would have taken it, but signifying the primacy of persons' being -.

Polo believes that throughout the centuries philosophical anthropology has been trumped by metaphysics. Say that metaphysics concerns the study of the universe and that philosophical anthropology focus on man. If we take man to be a bare metaphysical being in the sense in which [[Aristotle]], [[Aquinas]] and some other medieval philosophers considered and defined it as a 'rational substance', we will find extremely hard to explain [[free will]]. For the notion of substance is intrinsically tied up to metaphysical necessity, so that its substance can be characterised as being ''per se'' or needing not the input of any other to subsist. Of course that does not imply that the being of that substance is absolutely necessary, because no creature can cause itself to be.

Human freedom, however, is incompatible with necessity. Modern philosophers understood it only too well when they asserted that man's essence consisted in spontaneity. This is certainly a feature of free will. In any choice, I may be bound by a limited number of alternatives on offer, but at the crucial point I am totally free to choose any of the alternatives regardless of my own inclinations. Freedom awaits us in any act of choice manifesting the radical openness of the will. For Polo, 'various distinctions must be settled in the first transcendental, that is, in the act of being ''(esse)''' (I, p.&amp;nbsp;69). It is a mistake to call man 'free' once it has being called a 'substance', be it rational or not, for man is not a free-willed substance but a free-willed being. Thus, the distinction between the universe and man needs to be scaled up so as to work on a transcendental order. Human beings are different from comets, plants and animals not in external or accidental features, but at the level of what [[Aquinas]] would call ''actus essendi'' (act of being).

For Polo, the difference between the universe and man is this: Man is a co-being which co-exists with other co-existences. Man is the being existentially open to other acts of being: it co-exists with the being of the universe, with other human persons and, most importantly, with God. In its openness to others lies the dual character of its being, which makes the existence of a lonely person a metaphysical absurdity.

The ontological limits of a person do not have the sharper edges of other creatures’ beings. We conceive degrees of perfection in instruments such as a boiler depending on a variety of reasons, i.e. on how it fulfils or achieves some desirable purpose for which the instrument was crafted. A similar thing can be said of animals, in what they add up to sustaining biological life. The human being is equally open to perfection, but that increase, which is equally ruled by some purpose, is inherent to its act of being. Inasmuch as human beings co-exist with other co-beings, and especially with God, free will can grow.

Thus Polo conceives freedom not as sheer spontaneity, autonomous independence or lack of physical and psychological constraints, but in a new an unexpected sense: as being radically open to other beings. We may be tempted to think that a person’s relation with God is strictly causal, but that is only the case of the universe which in ''Access to Being'' was characterised as ''persistence''. A person’s unique dependence on God is the root of her freedom and hence, of an inward openness built on self-knowledge and self-giving. The person’s call to openness is at the same time a call to be ontologically ever-more, that is, to be more human in accord with the moral, ethical, and practical implications of what is a 'good' person by nature, and which can only be found in an Aristotelian, non-utilitarian frame of objective values.

Polo proposes that 'openness', 'freedom', 'intellection' and 'love' are "human transcendentals." This means that there can only be a human being when these four properties are in place, although the number of these human transcendentals is not restricted to these four. What is important is that human transcendentals allow an anonymous being to co-exist and to be recognised among other co-existences like her. In this way, Polo overturns the classic doctrine of transcendentals, for which properties such as 'being', 'one', 'truth', 'good' and 'beauty' are universal and all-embracing, including human beings. But he argues that since persons are able to actively acquire those intrinsically static qualities and be intimately transformed by their achievement, human transcendentals substantially differ from the classic set of transcendentals.

[[File:Gonzales Coques 2.JPG|thumb|Margaret Cavendish and her husband, William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne]]

'''Margaret Lucas Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne '''(1623 – 15 December 1673) was an English aristocrat, philosopher, poet, scientist, fiction-writer, and playwright during the 17th century. Born '''Margaret Lucas''', she was the youngest sister of prominent royalists Sir [[John Lucas, 1st Baron Lucas|John Lucas]] and [[Charles Lucas|Sir Charles Lucas]], who owned the manor of [[St. John's Abbey, Colchester|St. John's Abbey]] in [[Colchester]].&lt;ref&gt;Goose, N. and Cooper, J. (1998) Tudor and Stuart Colchester. Published by Victoria County History of Essex. ({{ISBN|0 86025 302 3}})&lt;/ref&gt; She became an attendant of Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]] and traveled with her into exile in France, living for a time at the court of the young [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]. She became the second wife of [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] in 1645, when he was a [[marquess]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;Cunning, David, "Margaret Lucas Cavendish", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL= &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/margaret-cavendish/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavendish was a poet, philosopher, writer of prose romances, essayist, and playwright who published under her own name at a time when most women writers published anonymously. Her writing addressed a number of topics, including gender, power, manners, scientific method, and philosophy. Her utopian romance, ''[[The Blazing World]]'', is one of the earliest examples of [[science fiction]].&lt;ref name=Khanna&gt;Khanna, Lee Cullen. "The Subject of Utopia: Margaret Cavendish and Her Blazing-World." ''Utopian and Science Fiction by Women: World of Difference.'' Syracuse: Syracuse UP, 1994. 15–34.&lt;/ref&gt; She is singular in having published extensively in natural philosophy and early modern science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=Eileen|title=Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, Observations upon Experimental Philosophy|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=0521776759|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; She published over a dozen original works; inclusion of her revised works brings her total number of publications to twenty-one.&lt;ref name="O'Neill 2001 xi"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=Eileen|title=Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, Observations upon Experimental Philosophy|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=0521776759|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavendish has been championed and criticized as a unique and groundbreaking woman writer. She rejected the [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical philosophy]] of the seventeenth century, preferring a vitalist model instead.&lt;ref name="O'Neill 2001 xi"/&gt; She was the first woman to attend a meeting at [[Royal Society of London]] in 1667 and she criticized and engaged with members and philosophers [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[René Descartes]], and [[Robert Boyle]].&lt;ref&gt;Akkerman, Nadine and Marguérite Corporaal 'Mad science beyond flattery. The correspondence of Margaret Cavendish and Constantijn Huygens' in: Early Modern Literary Studies 14(may, 2004), 2.1–21&lt;/ref&gt; She has been claimed as an advocate for animals and as an early opponent of [[animal testing]].&lt;ref name=Shevelow&gt;[[Kathryn Shevelow|Shevelow, Kathryn]]. ''For the love of animals: the rise of the animal protection movement'', Henry Holt and Company, 2008, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==
=== Childhood ===
[[Image:Mary Lucas.jpg|thumb|Mary Lucas, older sister of Margaret Cavendish]]

Cavendish's father, Thomas Lucas, was exiled after a duel that resulted in the death of "one Mr. Brooks"; he was pardoned by King James and returned to England in 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowerbank|first=Sylvia|title=Paper Bodies: A Margaret Cavendish Reader|year=2000|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Orchard Park, NY|isbn=1-55111-173X|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the youngest of eight children, Cavendish recorded that she spent a great deal of time with her siblings. She did not have a formal education but had access to scholarly libraries and tutors, although she intimated that the children paid little attention to the tutors, who were "rather for formality than benefit". At an early age, Cavendish was already putting her ideas and thoughts down on paper since during this time period it was not common or accepted for women to be publicly intelligent. She kept her intellectual endeavours within the privacy of her home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/margaret-cavendish/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Cunning|first=David|date=2015-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cavendish|first=Margaret|title=A True Relation of My Birth, Breeding, and Life|year=1656|location=London, England|editor=Sylvia Bowerbank and Sara Mendelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family was one of relatively significant means and Cavendish indicated that despite being a widow, her mother chose to keep her family in a condition "not much lower" than when her father was alive; the children had access to "honest pleasures and harmless delights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cavendish|first=Margaret|title=A True Relation of My Birth, Breeding, and Life|year=1656|location=London, England|pages=46–7|editor=Sylvia Bowerbank and Sara Mendelson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her mother had little to no male help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitzmaurice|first=James|date=|title=Cavendish, Margaret|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com.prxy4.ursus.maine.edu/view/article/4940?docPos=19|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|volume=|pages=|via=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lady-in-waiting to Queen Henrietta Maria===

When [[Queen Henrietta Maria]] was in Oxford, Cavendish successfully appealed to her mother for permission to become one of her Ladies-in-waiting. Cavendish accompanied the Queen upon her exile and moved to France. This took Cavendish away from her family for the first time. She notes that while she was very confident in the company of her siblings, amongst strangers she became extremely bashful. Cavendish explains that she was afraid she might speak or act inappropriately without her siblings' guidance, which would go against her ambition to be well received and well liked. She spoke only when absolutely necessary and, consequently, she came to be regarded as a fool. Cavendish excused her behaviour by stating that she preferred to be received as a fool rather than as wanton or rude. Regretting that she had left home to be a lady-in-waiting, Cavendish informed her mother she wanted to leave the court. Her mother, however, persuaded Cavendish to stay rather than disgrace herself by leaving and provided her with funds that, as Cavendish notes, quite exceeded the normal means of a courtier. Cavendish remained a lady-in-waiting for two more years until she was married to William Cavendish who was, at the time, Marquis of Newcastle (he was later made Duke).

=== Marriage to William Cavendish, Marquis of Newcastle ===
Cavendish noted that her husband liked her bashfulness. She also stated that he was the only man she was ever in love with, loving him not for title, wealth or power, but for merit, justice, gratitude, duty, and fidelity. She believed these to be attributes that would hold people together, even through misfortune. She further credited such qualities as assisting her husband and her family to endure the suffering they experienced as a result of their political allegiance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Cavendish never had any children, despite efforts made by her physician to help her inability to conceive.&lt;ref name="oxforddnb.com.prxy4.ursus.maine.edu"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitzmaurice|first=James|date=|title=Margaret Cavendish|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com.prxy4.ursus.maine.edu/view/article/4940?docPos=19|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband had two children from a previous marriage to survive infancy who went on to write a comedy that portrayed the couple as newlyweds.&lt;ref name="oxforddnb.com.prxy4.ursus.maine.edu"/&gt;  Cavendish later went on to write a biography on her husband, entitled ''The Life of the Thrice Noble, High and Puissant Prince William Cavendishe.''  In her dedication to her husband, Cavendish recounts a time when there were rumors surrounding the authorship of her works (specifically that her husband wrote them).  Cavendish notes that her husband defended her amidst these accusations.  But, she does admit to a creative relationship with her husband.  Cavendish even gives him credit as her writing tutor.  Her own writing "fashions an image of a husband and wife who rely on each other in the public realm of print." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Billing|first=Valerie|date=Fall 2011|title="Treble marriage": Margaret Cavendish, William Newcastle, and Collaborative Authorship|url=|journal=Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies|volume=11|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial problems===

A few years after her marriage, Cavendish and her husband's brother, [[Sir Charles Cavendish]], returned to England. Cavendish had heard that her husband's estate ([[Sequestration (law)|sequestrated]] due to his being a [[delinquent (royalist)|royalist delinquent]]) was to be sold and that she, as his wife, could hope to benefit from the sale. Cavendish, however, received no benefit. She pointedly noted that while many women petitioned for funds, she herself only petitioned once and, being denied, decided such efforts were not worth the trouble. After a year and a half she left England to be with her husband again.

===Character and Health===

Cavendish asserted in ''A True Relation of My Birth, Breeding, and Life'' that her bashful nature, what she described as "[[melancholia]]", made her "repent my going from home to see the World abroad." This melancholic nature manifested itself in a reluctance to talk about her work in public spheres, but it was something she satirised and reconceptualised in her writing&lt;ref name="Paper Bodies"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowerbank|first=Sylvia|title=Paper Bodies: A Margaret Cavendish Reader|year=2000|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Orchard Park, NY|isbn=1-55111-173-X|page=13|author2=Sara Mendelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavendish both defined and administered self-cures for the physical manifestations of her melancholia, which included "chill paleness," an inability to speak, and erratic gestures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowerbank|first=Syvia|title=Paper Bodies: A Margaret Cavendish Reader|year=2000|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Orchard Park, NY|isbn=1-55111-173-X|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fashion and Fame===

In her memoir, Cavendish explained her enjoyment in reinventing herself through fashion. She said that she aimed for uniqueness in her dress, thoughts, and behavior, and that she disliked wearing the same fashions as other women. She also made her desire to achieve fame public. Several passages of her memoir remarked upon her virtuous character, and that while she acknowledged goodness in others, she thought it acceptable that she should hope to be better than them. Cavendish said her ambition was to have everlasting fame. She also expected to be criticized for her decision to write a memoir. She responded by stating that she wrote the memoir for herself not for delight, but so that later generations would have a true account of her lineage and life. She said that she felt justified in writing her memoirs since it had been done by others, such as [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] and [[Ovid]].

== ''Poems and Fancies'' (1653) ==

''Poems and Fancies'' is a collection of poems, [[epistle]]s, and some [[prose]], written by Cavendish on a variety of themes. Topics included natural philosophy, atoms, nature personified, macro/microcosms, other worlds, death, battle, hunting, love, honour, and fame. Her poems at times take the form of dialogues between such things as earth and darkness, an oak and a man cutting it down, melancholy and mirth, and peace and war. As noted by Mistress Toppe (see below), formerly Elizabeth Chaplain and Cavendish's maid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lislie|first=Marina|title=Renaissance Utopias and the Problem of History|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=0801434009|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavendish's writings took the form of poetical fiction, moral instruction, philosophical opinion, dialogue, discourses and poetical romances. ''Poems and Fancies'' also included ''The Animal Parliament'', a prose piece consisting largely of speeches and letters. The collection concludes with Cavendish's thoughts on her writing and an advertisement promoting one of her future publications.

===Cavendish's Authorial Intent===

Cavendish concluded the collection by stating that she was aware that she did not write elegantly and that her phrasing and placement of words could be criticized. She said she had difficulty creating rhymes that could communicate her intended meaning. In short, Cavendish stated that she strove to keep meaning at the expense of elegance, as her aim was to successfully communicate her ideas. She also noted that she expected her work to be criticized for not being useful. In response, she stated that she wrote not to instruct her readers in the arts, sciences or divinity, but to pass her time, asserting that she made better use of her time than many others. Cavendish returned to these assertions throughout her epistles and poems.

===Epistle Dedicatory===

Like authors such as [[Aphra Behn]] and [[William Wordsworth]], Cavendish revealed much about her intended audience, writing purpose and philosophy in her [[preface]]s, [[prologue]]s, [[epilogue]]s and [[epistle]]s to the reader. Cavendish wrote several epistle dedications for ''Poems and Fancies''. The epistles were most often justifications of her writing both in terms of her decision to write at a time when women writers were not encouraged and in terms of her subject choice. Cavendish used the epistles to instruct readers how they ought to read and respond to her poetry, most often by inviting praise from supporters and requesting silence from those who did not like her work. Cavendish commonly used the epistles to call attention to and excuse potential weaknesses in her writing. The epistles were directed to specific audiences and varied accordingly.

The following is an account of several of Cavendish's epistles from ''Poems and Fancies''.

===Mental Spinning===

In her epistle dedication to Sir Charles Cavendish, her brother in law, Cavendish compared writing poetry to spinning and described poetry as mental spinning. She noted that while it was commonly thought to be more appropriate for women to spin than to write, she herself was better at writing. This is one of several occasions where Cavendish calls attention to [[stereotype|stereotypical]] [[gender role]]s, such as the belief that women should spin and not write, and then expands upon her reasons for not adhering to them. As in this epistle, Cavendish often employed metaphors to describe her writing in terms of stereotypically feminine tasks or interests, such as spinning, fashion, and motherhood. While Cavendish criticized her own work, she asserted that it would seem better if Sir Charles Cavendish looked favorably upon it. Cavendish often appealed to the reader to applaud her work, asserting that if it was well received it would actually be somewhat improved. She conclude by complimenting Charles' charity and generosity.

===The Pursuit of Fame===

In her epistle to noble and worthy ladies, as in many of her epistles, Cavendish straightforwardly expressed her desire for fame. Cavendish stated that she was not concerned that the best people like her writing, as long as many people did. She justified this by linking fame to noise and noise to great numbers of people. Cavendish often assumed a defensive position in her epistles, here justified by her assertion that she expected critiques from males and females not only on her writing, but on her practice of writing itself, as women writers were not encouraged. To this Cavendish argued that women who busy themselves writing will not act inappropriately or gossip. Though she anticipated criticism from females, she calls for female support so that she might gain honour and reputation. She closed by stating that if she should fail, she would see herself as being martyred for the cause of women.

===Defence of Writing and Fame===

In her epistle to Mistress Toppe, Cavendish stated that her main reason for writing was her desire for fame. Again, Cavendish acknowledged her writing as a digression from accepted gender norms and asked for acceptance. While Cavendish often spoke of her writing in metaphors of domestic or stereotypically feminine activities, here she attempted to excuse her desire for fame by distancing her ambition from the feminine. She described her ambition as a quest for glory, perfection, and praise, which, she stated, was not effeminate. Further, she pointed out that even while writing and pursuing fame she had remained modest and honourable and noted that she had done nothing to dishonour her family. Cavendish attributed her confidence, in what she describes as a time of censor, to her belief that there was no evil, only innocence in her desire for fame. As to her writing without permission, Cavendish excused herself by stating that it was easier to get a pardon after the fact than to obtain permission before. She privileged writing over gossiping, which she treated as a common and negative female activity. She considered writing to be a comparatively harmless pastime. She credited her books as tangible examples of her contemplation and contrasted her self-proclaimed harmless ideas with wild thoughts which, she stated, led to indiscreet actions.

Cavendish explored writing [[closet drama]]s during her exile and became one of the most well known women playwrights due to her interest in philosophical nature.

A response from Mistress Toppe follows this epistle in ''Poems and Fancies'', in which Toppe praised Cavendish and her skill in poetical fiction, moral instruction, philosophical opinion, dialogue, discourses and poetical romances.

===Language, Knowledge and Error===

Cavendish also included a prefatory letter to natural philosophers. Cavendish stated that she did not know any languages except English, and that even her knowledge of English was somewhat limited, since she was familiar only with "that which is most usually spoke." In other words, she downplayed her knowledge of the technical vocabulary used by natural philosophers. Thus, she said, she lacked knowledge of the opinions and discourses which precede her own. She then dismissed any errors she might make as trivial, asserting that she did not mean her text to be taken as truth. Rather, she wrote simply to pass time and expected that her work would be read for the same purpose. This epistle was also the contained her explanation for writing in verse. She stated that poets were thought to write fiction, and that fiction was aligned with pastime, not truth. Verse, then, was expected to contain errors. Cavendish lamented that her work was not more entertaining and advised readers to skip any part of the book that they did not like.

===Writing to Pass the Time===

In her epistle to the reader, Cavendish stated that with no children and, at that time, no estate, she had a lot of spare time. She, therefore, did not engage in housewifery, but filled her time with writing. She stated that good husbandry in poetry was well ordered fancy composed of fine language, proper phrases and significant words. Cavendish excused any errors that might be found in her work as due to her youth and inexperience, and explained that she wrote only to distract herself from thoughts of her husband's and her own hardships. Comparing her book to a child, she said that the book/child was innocent, young, well-behaved, bashful and sensitive, and requested that the reader blame her, the author/mother, not the book, if they did not like it. If, however, the book was well liked, she made it clear that she expected fame.

===Instruction on Comprehension and Judgement===

In her epistle to the poets, Cavendish noted that since women seldom wrote, her own act of writing might be ridiculed, as the strange and unusual seem fantastical, the fantastical seems odd, and the odd seems ridiculous. She requested that her work be judged by reason, not prejudice. She then excused any weaknesses in her poetry by stating that she wrote only to get away from melancholy thoughts and to fill idle time. She employed a food/feasting metaphor and stated that her poems are not ripe, but that applause and praise would make them pass as a 'general feast' to those of vulgar taste who take quantity over quality. As was typical in her writing, applause was welcomed and criticism censored, as she advises those who did not like her poetry to keep silent. She also stated that hers are poems of fancy and thereby required study. She recommended that as one with a troubled conscience ought to look to a minister for guidance, so should the reader ask a poet for help in understanding her poems. Attempting once again to guide the reader to a positive reception of her book, Cavendish drew a distinction between poets (able judges of poetry) and rhymers (faulty judges of poetry) and advised people not to say that her book was nonsense or poorly constructed out of their own ignorance and malice. Returning again to her desire for fame, Cavendish noted that if an honest poet, who was not envious, judged her work, it would receive applause.

Cavendish asked the reader to read her fancies (poems) slowly, paying attention to every word, because every word was a fancy itself. She warned that if readers lost their place or missed lines, they would miss the meaning of the entire work.

===Poems: Excuses and Instructions===

Cavendish followed some of her epistles with poems that instructed the reader how the poems came to be published and how they should be received. The proximity of the poems to the epistles and their similarity in subject and tone, suggests that they may be interpreted as being written from Cavendish's own point of view.

The poem ''The Poetresses hasty Resolution'', like many of Cavendish's epistles, contained excuses for any errors that might be found in the poet's work and begged for praise. In the poem, the poet stated that self-love influenced her judgement of her own poetry, which she found she liked so much that she was moved to continue writing in hope of fame. She said that she wrote without thought about how her work would be received by critics. The poet then recalled how she was visited by Reason who advised her to stop writing. Reason told her that her writing was a waste of time, that her work would not be well received and that she should not have her work printed so that the printer would not lose money. Reason also informed the poet that there were already too many books and that she should burn what she had written to spare the world from even more. The poet noted her angry response and stated that she sent her book to press before she could be persuaded otherwise. In hindsight, however, she regretted her actions. Informing the reader that she felt shamed by her writing, the poet told the reader to pity her and wipe away her tears with praise.

In ''The Poetresses Petition'', she compared a negative reception to her books with their death. If the books suffered such a death (i.e. criticism), she requested silence and that they be forgotten, without altar or inscriptions, and left undisturbed unless new merit was found in them. Again, Cavendish would censor criticism and promote fame, instructing that only positive criticism should be voiced.

In ''An Apology for Writing So Much upon This Book'', she compared her book to a child and compared the book/child and author/parent to birds. The book, she stated, was like a baby bird just going out on its own. The author, like a parent bird, was unsure whether or not the book/baby bird would be safe and wrote/chirped in an attempt to protect it.

Within the memoir, Cavendish also described her pastimes and manners and offered an account of her own personality and ambition, including thoughts on her extreme bashfulness, contemplative nature, and writing. Cavendish also shared her views on gender (appropriate behavior and activity), politics (Parliamentarians versus Royalists) and class (the proper behavior of servants).

Cavendish's memoir also detailed the lives of her family including a short biography of her brother [[Charles Lucas]], one of the best [[English Civil War|Civil War]] [[Cavalier]] cavalry commanders who was executed by the Parliamentarians for treason during the [[Second English Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB |last=Firth |first=Charles Harding |wstitle=Lucas, Charles (d.1648) |volume=34 |pages=229–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Cavendish addressed the economic and personal hardships she and her family faced as a result of war and political allegiance, such as the loss of estates and bereavements.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Cavendish’s Natural Philosophy===
Eileen O'Neill provided an overview of Cavendish's [[natural philosophy]] and its critical reception in her introduction to ''Observations upon Experimental Philosophy''.&lt;ref name="O'Neill 2001"&gt;O'Neill 2001&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neill described Cavendish's natural philosophy as rejecting [[Aristotelianism]] and mechanical philosophy and favouring [[Stoicism|Stoic]] doctrines. She noted that while women rarely wrote about natural philosophy in the seventeenth century, Cavendish published six books on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill 2001 xv–xvii&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neill pointed out that Cavendish herself was not formally educated in natural philosophy, though William Cavendish and his brother Charles shared an interest in the subject and supported Margaret's interest and study in the area. Cavendish might also have been influenced through social encounters with philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes.&lt;ref name="O'Neill 2001"/&gt; O'Neill believed that Hobbes (who had instructed Charles in philosophy) had significant influence on Cavendish's natural philosophy and noted that Cavendish was among the few seventeenth-century supporters of Hobbes' materialist philosophy, which argued that incorporeal souls did not exist in nature. Beginning in the 1660s, Cavendish began to study the work of her contemporaries more seriously. O'Neill suggested that such study was intended to enable Cavendish to argue her own points better by contrasting them with those of other natural philosophers.&lt;ref name="O'Neill 2001"/&gt;

===Critical Response to Cavendish's Natural Philosophy===

O'Neill noted that Cavendish's natural philosophy, and writing in general, was criticised by many of her contemporaries as well as by more recent readers, such as [[Samuel Pepys]], [[Henry More]] and [[Virginia Woolf]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill 2001, p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt; Cavendish's work has also received positive criticism and she was lauded by many for having written on typically male-dominated subjects, such as natural philosophy. Letters and poems of praise written by her husband were included in several of her published works.

===Writing as an Honourable Disease===

In her preface to ''Observations upon Experimental Philosophy'', Cavendish stated that she expected readers to say that her practice of writing prolifically was a disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cavendish|first=Margaret|title=Observations on Experimental Philosophy|date=1668|location=London|isbn=0521776759|editor=Eileen O'Neill}}, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; If so, Cavendish stated, then many others, including [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]], [[Homer]], and St. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], had also been very ill of the same disease. She remarked that it was an honour for someone of great ambition (as she often identified herself) to share the disease of such wise and eloquent men. In these, as in her other writings, she asserted that she wrote for herself and that her writing was a harmless pastime when compared with those of many other women. She contradicted herself, however, by adding that she wrote for delight, which she had denied in her previous work. Also somewhat contradictory was her assertion that she would continue to write even if she had no readers, which is not in line with her desire for fame. Ultimately, Cavendish excused her criticism of and engagement with the theories of other natural philosophers as a necessary step in the search for truth.

===Learning versus Wit===

In her epistle to the reader, Cavendish wrote that woman's wit may equal that of man, and therefore women might be able to learn as easily as men. She argued that wit was natural, whereas learning was artificial, and that, in her time, men had more opportunity to educate themselves than women.&lt;ref&gt;Cavendish 1668, p. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavendish remarked upon her own experience reading philosophical works. She noted that many such works challenged her understanding, as they often contained difficult words and expressions that she had not previously encountered. It followed that Cavendish advised writers of philosophy to use appropriate language to aid their less expert readers. Cavendish defended her position by stating that philosophical terms ought to ease communication of one's thoughts. She believed that successful communication was possible in all languages and criticised those who complicated communication (particularly English writers) as aiming to gain esteem from those who admire writing simply because they did not understand it, without considering that it might be nonsense. In her own work, Cavendish stated, she had chosen not to use difficult terms, although she pointed out that she understood such terms. Her stated reason was that she desired her work to be accessible to people regardless of their education. Her aim was to communicate her ideas clearly. She requested that any errors that might be found within her work should be overlooked and that readers should remain focused on her main ideas. Here, as in many of her epistles, Cavendish instructed her reader how to approach her work and requested that readers should read her work in its entirety and withhold criticism until they have done so.

==''The Description of a New World, Called the Blazing World'' (1666)==

{{Main|The Blazing World}}

Cavendish's prose tale was published in 1666 and again in 1668. Each time it was published with ''Observations upon Experimental Philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lilley|first=Kate|title=The Description of a New World, Called the Blazing World|date=2004|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=London|isbn=9780140433722|page=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by many, including Silvia Bowerbank and Sara Mendelson,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paper Bodies: A Margaret Cavendish Reader|last=Bowerbank|first=Sylvia|publisher=Broadview Press|year=2000|isbn=155111173X|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this early version of science fiction criticized and explored such issues as science, gender, and power. It also examined the relationship between imagination vs. reason and philosophy vs. fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leslie|first=Marina|year=2012|title=Mind the Map: Fancy, Matter, and World Construction in Margaret Cavendish's "Blazing World"|journal=Renaissance and Reformation / Renaissance et Réforme|volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavendish wrote herself into the book, which detailed a fictional new world (not just a new continent but an entirely separate world) and its empress. She remarked in her epilogue to the reader that she herself was empress of the philosophical world. In fact, in Cavendish's epistle to the reader she remarked that, in much the same way as there was a Charles the First, she would be considered Margaret the First.

==''CCXI Sociable Letters'' (1664)==

Published in 1664 by William Wilson, ''CCXI Sociable Letters'' (1664) is a collection of letters as if composed by real women. The organisation of the letters is similar to her other book ''The World's Olio'' (1655). The topics are as varied as the forms and length of the letters. Topics include marriage, war, politics, medicine, science, English and classical literature, and miscellaneous topics like gambling and religious extremism. Though some letters seem to indicate some characters are actual people, e.g., Thomas Hobbes may be the character in letter 173 and C. R. possibly stands for King Charles II,&lt;ref name=Fitzmaurice&gt;Fitzmaurice, James. "Introduction." ''Sociable Letters''. Edited by James Fitzmaurice. Peterborough, ON: Broadview Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and some letters are addressed to real people Cavendish communicated with often, the majority of characters are fictional leading to a surprisingly vibrant and ongoing conversation and observation about contemporary life.

==Plays (1662) and (1668)==

Two volumes of Cavendish's dramatic works were printed. ''Plays'' (1662), printed by A. Warren (London)  includes the following:

*Loves Adventures 
*The Several Wits
*Youths Glory, and Deaths Banquet
*The Lady Contemplation
*Wits Cabal
*The Unnatural Tragedy
*The Public Wooing
*The Matrimonial Trouble
*Nature's Three Daughters, Beauty, Love and Wit
*The Religious
*The Comical Hash
*Bell in Campo 
*A Comedy of the Apocryphal Ladies
*The Female Academy

''Plays, Never Before Printed'' (1668) was published by Anne Maxwell (London) and contains:

*The Sociable Companions, or the Female Wits
*The Presence 
*Scenes (edited from The Presence)
*The Bridals
*[[The Convent of Pleasure]]
*A Piece of a Play

==Religious beliefs==
Cavendish's views on God and religion remained somewhat ambiguous. From her writings, it is clear that she was a Christian but she did not often address her religious orientation. In her Physical Opinions, however, she explicitly acknowledges her belief in the existence of God, writing "pray account me not an Atheist, but beleeve as I do in God Almighty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cavendish|title=Philosophical and Physical Opinions|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53055.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, she seeks to split philosophy from theology, and therefore avoids debating God's actions in many of her philosophical works. Uncertainty regarding her theological viewpoints is unusual for a woman writer of her time period, considering that much of early modern women's writing was oriented around religion. However, Cavendish acknowledged the existence of God but she "holds that natural reason cannot perceive or have an idea of an immaterial being". She argued that “when we name God, we name an Unexpressible, and Incomprehensible Being.”&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;

== Other works ==

Cavendish also published collections of ''Philosophical Letters'' (1664), [[orations]], as in her collection entitled ''Orations'' (1662). Many of her works addressed such issues as natural philosophy, gender, power and manners. Cavendish's plays were never acted during her lifetime, but a number of plays, including ''The Convent of Pleasure'' (1668)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/margaret-cavendish-plays-in-performance/oclc/61153997 Worldcat.org]&lt;/ref&gt; have been staged since.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;Williams, Gweno. ''Margaret Cavendish: Plays in Performance''. York: St. John's College, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; As noted, several of Cavendish's works have epistles, prefaces, prologues and epilogues in which she discussed her work, philosophy and ambition while instructing the reader how to read and respond to her writing. Cavendish's writing has been criticised and championed from the time of its original publication to present day.

==Formal titles from birth to death==
*Mistress Margaret Lucas (1623–1645)
*The Most Hon. The Marchioness of Newcastle-upon-Tyne (1645–1665)
*''Her Grace'' The Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne (1665–1673)

== Critical Reception ==

Because of her being a woman author at the time, the fact that she was willing to converse with men on natural philosophy, and her theatrical sense of dress, she eventually gained the nickname "Mad Madge",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Claire|title=Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, c 1623-1674|url=http://herstoria.com/margaret-cavendish-duchess-of-newcastle-c-1623-1674/|website=Herstoria|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of her contemporaries lambasted her works for their perceived eccentricity. For example, fellow scientist and Royal Society member [[Samuel Pepys]], once famously wrote that she was "a mad, conceited, ridiculous woman" after reading one of her biographies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Narain|first1=Mona|title=Notorious Celebrity: Margaret Cavendish and the Spectacle of Fame|journal=The Journal of the Midwest Modern Language Association|date=Fall 2009|volume=42|issue=2|pages=69–95|jstor=25674377|ref=Narain}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothy Osborne]] reflected in one of her published letters, after reading one of the Duchess' books, that she was "sure there are soberer people in Bedlam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keller|first1=Eve|title=Producing Petty Gods: Margaret Cavendish's Critique of Experimental Science|journal=ELH: Enlgish Literary History|date=1997|volume=64|issue=2|pages=447–471|doi=10.135/elh.1997.0017|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/11366/summary|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was typical of the impression the general public seemed to have of her. She had her admirers, however: [[Mildmay Fane]], Earl of Westmorland, wrote a poem in her honor on the flyleaf of his copy of ''Poems and Fancies''; [[John Dryden]] congratulated Newcastle on his wife's "masculine style"; Sir [[Kenelm Digby]] and [[Henry More]], to both of whom she gave copies of her work, professed to value it; and [[Joseph Glanvill]] and [[Walter Charleton]] respected her enough to offer her serious criticism and advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duchess of Newcastle Margaret Cavendish|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/margaret-cavendish|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only that, but [[Charles Lamb]] enjoyed her ''Sociable Letters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Kathleen|title=Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle: A Glorious Fame|date=March 3, 1988|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=9780747505679}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' and so much admired her biography of her husband, the Duke, that he referred to it as a jewel "for which no casket is rich enough."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitemore|first1=Clara H.|title=Woman's work in English fiction, from the restoration to the mid-Victorian period|date=1910|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|location=New York and London|page=8|url=https://archive.org/stream/womansworkinengl00whit#page/8/mode/2up/search/m|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for her scientific pursuits, she was widely looked down upon by the [[Royal Society]], who had a history of excluding women from their ranks; Margaret Cavendish was the first female to be invited, and it wasn't until 1945 that they inducted their first female member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holmes|first1=Richard|title=The Royal Society's lost female scientists|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/nov/21/royal-society-lost-women-scientists|accessdate=9 August 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One member, [[John Evelyn]], considered her "a mighty pretender to learning, poetry, and philosophy." A second member, [[Robert Boyle]], considered many of the experiments shown to Cavendish by the Royal Society to be trifles, disparaged her tendency to measure things by their "strangeness" and "prettiness," as opposed to their "use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mintz|first1=Samuel I.|title=The Duchess of Newcastle's Visit to the Royal Society|journal=The Journal of English and Germanic Philology|date=April 1952|volume=51|issue=02|pages=168–176|jstor=27713402|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, her knowledge was still recognized by some, such as proto-feminist [[Bathsua Makin]], who wrote that "The present Dutchess of New-Castle, by her own Genius, rather than any timely Instruction, over-tops many grave Gown-Men," and considered her a prime example of what women could become through education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Makin|first1=Bathsua|title=An Essay to Revive the Ancient Education of Gentlewomen|date=1673|publisher=Printed by J.D., to be sold by Tho. Parkhurst|location=London|url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/makin/education/education.html|accessdate=3 August 2017|ref=Makin}}&lt;/ref&gt; New manuscript evidence also suggests that she was read and taken seriously by at least some early Royal Society members such as the secretary, [[Nehemiah Grew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Begley|first1=Justin.|title='The Minde is Matter Moved': Nehemiah Grew on Margaret Cavendish|journal=Intellectual History Review|date=May 2017|volume=27|issue=04|pages=493–514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long time after her death, her eccentricity prevented her from being taken seriously by literary historians; it wasn't until [[Virginia Woolf]] wrote ''The Common Reader'' in 1925 that discourse rediscovered the Duchess of Newcastle. On the subject of Cavendish's works, Woolf said that "though her philosophies are futile, and her plays intolerable, and her verses mainly dull, the vast bulk of the Duchess is leavened by a vein of authentic fire. One cannot help following the lure of her erratic and lovable personality as it meanders and twinkles through page after page. There is something noble and Quixotic and high-spirited, as well as crack-brained and bird-witted, about her. Her simplicity is so open; her intelligence so active; her sympathy with fairies and animals so true and tender. She has the freakishness of an elf, the irresponsibility of some non-human creature, its heartlessness, and its charm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolf|first1=Virginia|title=The Common Reader|date=1925|publisher=ebooks@Adelaide|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91c/index.html|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After centuries of disinterest due to her eccentricity, Margaret Cavendish became popular in the 1980s as she was rediscovered and analyzed from a modern feminist perspective; in that time, there have been nine book length critical studies of Cavendish, not including a biography that was written in 1957, which can be found [[#Books|here]]. There have been many attempts to justify her eccentricity with a historic lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gagen|first1=Jean|title=Honor and Fame in the Works of the Duchess of Newcastle|journal=Studies in Philology|date=1959|volume=56|issue=03|pages=519–538|jstor=4173282|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chalmers|first1=Hero|title=Dismantling the myth of "mad madge": the cultural context of Margaret Cavendish's authorial self-presentation|journal=Women's Writing|date=1997|volume=4|issue=03|pages=323–340|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09699089700200022|accessdate=4 August 2017|doi=10.1080/09699089700200027}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also gained fame as one of the first female science fiction writers, namely for her early utopian novel ''[[The Blazing World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prakas|first1=Tessie|title="A World of her own Invention": The Realm of Fancy in Margaret Cavendish’s The Description of a New World, Called the Blazing World|journal=Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies|date=Winter 2016|volume=16|issue=1|pages=123–145|doi=10.1353/jem.2016.0000|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/610533|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her self insert character, named Margaret Cavendish, in ''[[The Blazing World]]'' is said to be one of the earliest examples of the modern [[Mary Sue]] trope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Jennifer Sherman|title=Everyone, We Need to Talk About 17th-Century Badass Writer Margaret Cavendish|url=https://www.themarysue.com/margaret-cavendish/amp/|website=The Mary Sue|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, her plays have also been examined by the lens of Performance Studies, as they blur the lines between performance and literature, challenge gender identities, and upset gender norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kellett|first1=Katherine R.|title=Performance, Performativity, and Identity in Margaret Cavendish's "The Convent of Pleasure"|journal=Studies in English Literature|date=Spring 2008|volume=48|issue=02|pages=419–442|jstor=40071341|doi=10.1353/sel.0.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional analysis on Margaret Cavendish can be found [[#Articles|here]].

This new wave of interest has also brought about several modern media projects in Cavendish's name.  [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AFE4V5U/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1 ''Margaret the First'' by Danielle Dutton] dramatizes the life of the eccentric author and is written “with lucid precision and sharp cuts through narrative time”, encompassing a new approach to “imagining the life of a historical woman”.  Additionally, as the [[Digital humanities|Digital Humanities]] rise in popularity and importance, several digital projects have started that archive Cavendish's works.  The [https://www.margaretcavendishsociety.org/ International Margaret Cavendish Society] was established to “provide a means of communication between scholars worldwide” and to increase awareness of Cavendish's scholarly presence.  The site is a hub for newsletters, contacts, and links to Cavendish's works.  Similarly, the [http://digitalcavendish.org/ Digital Cavendish Project] works to make Cavendish's writing accessible and readable for people across the web as well as to “highlight digital research, image archives, scholarly projects, and teaching materials”.  On January 26, 2018, the Digital Cavendish Twitter account [https://twitter.com/DigiCavendish/status/956910005302775809 announced that their next goal would be to compile the Completed Works of Margaret Cavendish].

'''Multiple realizability''', in the [[philosophy of mind]], is the thesis that the same mental property, state, or event can be implemented by different physical properties, states, or events. The idea has its roots in the late 1960s and early 1970s when a number of philosophers, most prominently [[Hilary Putnam]] (1967, 1988) and [[Jerry Fodor]] (1975), put it forth as an argument against [[reductionism|reductionist]] accounts of the relation between mental and physical kinds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiple-realizability/ "Multiple Realizability" entry at Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy by John Bickle]&lt;/ref&gt; In short, a theory of mind that includes multiple realizability allows for the existence of [[Chinese room#Strong AI|strong AI]]. The original targets of these arguments were the [[type-identity theory]] and [[eliminative materialism]]. The same arguments from multiple realizability were also used to defend many versions of [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], especially ''Machine state functionalism''.

In recent years, however, multiple realizability has been used to attack the very theory that it was originally designed to defend.  As a result, functionalism has fallen out of favor as a dominant theory in the philosophy of mind.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The dominant theory ("received view" in the words of [[Ernest Lepore|Lepore]] and [[Zenon Pylyshyn|Pylyshyn]]) in modern philosophy of mind is a version of generic [[Physicalism#Non-reductive physicalism|non-reductive physicalism]]{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} and one of its central pillars is the hypothesis of multiple realizability.

Complicating our historical understanding, [[Ricardo Restrepo Echavarria|Restrepo]] noted in 2009 that the thesis of the multiple realizability of the mental was held by [[Alan Turing|Turing]] at least ten years before the usually attributed authors described the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Restrepo, R. (2009). ''Russell's Structuralism and the Supposed Death of Computational Cognitive Science.'' Minds and Machines 19(2): 181-197.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, Turing expressed the multiple realizability of the mental in the following:

{{quote|The [Babbage Engine's] storage was to be purely mechanical, using wheels and cards.

The fact that Babbage's [[Analytical Engine]] was to be entirely mechanical will help us rid ourselves of a superstition. Importance is often attached to the fact that modern digital computers are electrical, and the nervous system is also electrical. Since Babbage's machine was not electrical, and since all digital computers are in a sense equivalent, we see that this use of electricity cannot be of theoretical importance. ... If we wish to find such similarities we should look rather for mathematical analogies of function.&lt;ref&gt;Turing, A. (1950). Computing machinery and intelligence. Mind 59. In J. Copeland (Ed.), The essential Turing (pp. 433–460). Oxford: Claredon Press, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Putnam's formulation==
[[Image:Reduktionismus.png|thumb|right|An illustration of multiple realizability. ''M'' stands for mental state and ''P'' stands for physical state. More than one ''P'' can instantiate one ''M'', but not vice versa. Causal relations between states are represented by the arrows (''M1'' causes ''M2'', etc.)]]
In several papers published in he late 1960s, [[Hilary Putnam]] provides a classic example of the thesis of multiple realizability. In these papers, he argues that, contrary to [[Type physicalism|type-identity theory]], it is not the case that "pain is identical to [[C-fibre]] firing." Pain corresponds to, or is at least correlated with, completely different physical states of the nervous system in different organisms and yet they all experience the same [[Mental representation|mental state]] of "being in pain." Putnam cited numerous examples from all over the animal kingdom to illustrate his thesis. Is it likely that the brain structures of all mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians and molluscs realize pain, or other mental states, in exactly the same way? Do they even have the same brain structures? Clearly not, if we believe the evidence furnished by comparative [[neuroanatomy]] and [[neurophysiology]]. How can they possibly share the same mental states and properties? The answer must be that these mental kinds are realized by different physical states in different species. Putnam then takes his argument a step further, and asks about such things as the nervous systems of alien beings, artificially-intelligent robots and silicon-based life forms. Should such hypothetical entities be considered ''a priori'' incapable of experiencing pain just because they do not possess the same neurochemistry as humans? Putnam concludes that type-identity and other reductive theorists make an extremely "ambitious" and "highly implausible" conjecture which can be disproved with just one example of multiple realizability. This argument is referred to as ''the likelihood argument''.

Putnam also formulates a complementary argument based on, what he calls, ''functional isomorphism''. He defines the concept in these terms: "Two systems are functionally isomorphic if ''there is a correspondence between the states of one and the states of the other that preserves functional relations''." So, in the case of computers, two machines are functionally isomorphic if and only if the  sequential relations among states in the first are exactly mirrored by the sequential relations among states in the second. Therefore, a computer made out of silicon chips and a computer made out of cogs and wheels can be functionally isomorphic but constitutionally diverse. Functional isomorphism implies multiple realizability. This is referred to as the "a priori argument".

Jerry Fodor, Putnam and others also note that, along with being a very effective argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that ''any'' low-level explanation of higher-level mental phenomena would be insufficiently abstract and general. Functionalism, which attempts to identify mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively in terms of causes and effects, abstracts from the physico-chemical level of microphysics and hence seems to be a more suitable alternative explanation of the relation between mind and body. In fact, there are many functional kinds such as mousetraps, software and bookshelves that are multiply realized at the physical level.

==Fodor's generalization==
[[Jaegwon Kim]] takes up the challenge of responding to the problems posed by multiple realizability for reductionist theories by suggesting that the physical realization base of a particular mental state is not a particular physical state but the disjunction of the physical states which realize it. [[Jerry Fodor]] replies to this objection by formulating a generalization of the multiple realizability thesis. According to Fodor, multiple realizability is not just something that occurs "across physical structure-types" but is a phenomenon that could occur even within the same token system (such as an organism). At different times, the same organism may realize type-identical mental kinds in physically different forms. (This thesis was later given some empirical support with the discovery of the relative [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of the human brain).

Fodor uses this generalized multiple realizability thesis to argue against reductionism of the mind and of the special sciences. The key to Fodor's argument is that, in his characterization of reductionism, all mental kind predicates in an ideal and completed psychology must correspond with a physical kind predicate in an ideal and completed physics. He suggests taking [[Ernest Nagel]]'s theory of reduction, which insists on the derivability of all terms in the theory to be reduced from terms in the reducing theory and the bridging laws, as the canonical theory of reduction. Given generalized multiple realizability, the physical science part of these psychophysical bridge laws will end up being a (possibly infinite) disjunction of all the terms referring to possible physical realizations of a mental kind. This disjunction cannot be a kind-predicate and therefore the entire statement cannot be a [[Physical law|law of physics]]. The special sciences cannot be reduced to physics in this way, according to Fodor.

In 1988, Hilary Putnam applied the argument from Fodor's generalized version of multiple realizability to argue against functionalism itself, including, and above all, his own version of functionalism, [[machine state functionalism]]. Noting that functionalism is essentially a watered-down reductionist or identity theory in which mental kinds are ultimately identified with functional kinds, Putnam argues that mental kinds are probably multiply realizable over functional kinds. The same mental state or property can be implemented or realized by different states of a [[universal Turing machine]].

==Objections and responses==
Early objections to multiple realizability were limited to the narrow, "across structures-type" version. Starting with [[David Kellogg Lewis]], many reductionists argued that it is very common, perhaps the rule, in actual scientific practice to reduce one theory to another by way of "local" and structure-specific reductions. A frequently cited example of this sort of [[intertheoretic reduction]] is the case of temperature from classical thermodynamics. Temperature is identical to mean molecular kinetic energy, but this is only true of ''temperature in a gas''. Temperature in a solid is identical to mean ''maximal'' molecular kinetic energy, because the molecules of a solid are more restricted in their movements. Temperature in a plasma is something of a mystery, since the molecules of a plasma are torn apart. Therefore, temperature, in classical thermodynamics is multiply realized in a wide diversity of microphysical states.

One common defense of multiple realizability argues that any such response which attempts to address the problem of the possibility of ''generalized'' multiple realizability must necessarily be so "local" and "context" specific in nature, referring exclusively to a certain token system of a certain structure-type at a certain time, that its reductions would be incompatible with even a minimally acceptable degree of generality in scientific theorizing. This problem is well illustrated by the controversial question of the plasticity of the human brain. Simply put, neural plasticity consists in the fact that different areas of the brain can, and often do, take over the functions of other parts that have been damaged as the result of traumatic injury, pathology, natural biological development and other processes. Any psychology which is narrowed down sufficiently to handle this level of multiple realizability will almost certainly not be general enough to capture the generalizations needed to explain only human psychology.

Recent reductionists (including [[William Bechtel|Bechtel]] and [[Jennifer Mundale|Mundale]]) reply that this is not empirically plausible. In order to conduct research and carry out experiments in the neurosciences, some universal consistencies in brain structures must either exist or be assumed to exist. The similarity (produced by [[homology (biology)|homology]] or convergent evolution) of brain structures allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability (especially the generalized form) were an empirical fact, then results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful or useful when generalized to explain the behavior or characteristics of another species (or organism of the same species; or in the generalized form, even the same organism).

[[Sungsu Kim]] has recently responded to this objection by pointing to the important distinction between homology of brain structures and [[homoplasy]]. Homologies are any characteristics of physiology, morphology, behavior or psychology that are shared by two or more species and that are inherited from a common ancestor. Homoplasies are similar or identical characteristics that are shared by two or more species but that are not inherited from a common ancestor, having evolved independently. The feet of ducks and platypuses are a good example of homoplasy, while the hands of humans and chimps are a good example of homology. The fact that brain structures are homologous provides no evidence either for or against multiple realizability. The only way to empirically test the thesis of multiple realizability would be to examine brain structures and determine whether some homoplasious "psychological processes or functions might be 'constructed' from different material" and supported by different brain structures just as the flight capacities of bats and birds emerge from different morphophysiologies. The emergence of similar behavioral outputs or psychological functions brought about by similar or identical brain structures in [[Convergent evolution|convergent]] evolutionary lineages would provide some evidence against multiple realizability, since it is highly improbable that this would happen, if not for constraints on the type of physical system that can realize mental phenomena. This, however, would not completely refute the possibility of realizibility of mental states in radically different physical systems such as non-carbon based life forms or machines.

==Kim's argument==
[[Jaegwon Kim]] has recently argued against non-reductive physicalism on the grounds that it violates the [[Causal closure|causal closure of the physical]]. The rough idea is that physics provides a full explanation of physical events. If mental properties are causally efficacious, they must either be identical to physical properties, or there must be widespread overdetermination. The latter is often held to be either unlikely or even impossible on conceptual grounds. If Kim is right, then the options seem to be either reduction or elimination.

==Medium independence==
In his mechanistic account of computation, [[Gualtiero Piccinini]] appeals to the notion of medium independence.  To understand this, we must first differentiate three related qualities:  variable realizability, multiple realizability, and medium independence.  A property is said to be variably realizable if it can be instantiated by different realizers.  For a property to be multiply realizable, the property must be able to be instantiated by different realizers and different mechanisms.  For example, consider a winged corkscrew and a waiter's corkscrew.  Both have the property of removing corks and do so through the same mechanism - a screw and pull mechanism.  Because the mechanism is fundamentally unchanged, the property is variably realizable.  Next, consider the property of trapping mice as instantiated by mousetraps.  Consider the classic spring mousetrap and the glue mousetrap.  Both instantiate the same property, the ability to trap mice, but they do so through different mechanisms.  As such, the property is multiply realizable.  Medium independence has an criteria over and above those of multiple realizablity.  A property is medium independent if it can be instantiated by different realizers and different mechanisms and if the inputs and outputs of the mechanisms are also multiply realizable.  As you can see, a mousetrap is not medium independent; it must take a mouse as an input.  A computer, though, is medium independent.  A computer can be constructed from different parts assembled into different mechanisms and, importantly, can take different types of inputs and outputs.  In typical digital computers, the inputs and outputs are voltages, but in quantum computers, the inputs and outputs would be different. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Piccinini | first = Gualtiero | title = Physical Computation: A Mechanistic Account | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2015 | page = 10 | isbn = 9780199658855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicholas Zammit''' (1815–1899) was a Maltese medical doctor, an architect, an artistic designer, and a major philosopher. His area of specialisation in philosophy was chiefly [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, pp. 273–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his philosophical career he did not adhere to just one intellectual position. Roughly two-thirds into his life, Zammit passed from a liberal way of thinking to a conservative one.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grech|1998|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that there are no carry-overs, developments, or continuations between the two phases, or that Zammit himself acknowledged such a division. Notwithstanding, the development suggests that an analysis of Zammit's works will reveal different attitudes, dispositions, emphasis, and conclusions of the two periods.

==Life==

===Beginnings===
Zammit was born at [[Siggiewi]], Malta, on November 29, 1815, from John Nicholas Zammit and Vicenza née Vella. He seems to have hailed from a well-established family, for he was given a good education, superior to that of other children in those days.

Later, Zammit entered the [[University of Malta|Royal University of Malta]], at Valletta, to study medicine as a main subject. His subsidiary studies included Latin and Italian literature, philosophy, and architecture. All of these were subjects which Zammit continued to interest himself in throughout his life.

An incident which occurred in 1835 suggests that, as a university student, he was somewhat rowdy. Together with some of his class mates, he behaved badly, showed disrespect to some of his professors, and went as far as disrupting a graduation ceremony. The naughty lads were taken before the university council for a ''de moribus'' (literally, concerning behaviour) hearing. The council decided to expel Zammit and two of his pals from the university. However, subsequently, the punishment was commuted to one year postponement of their final exams. This suspension was upheld during the years 1838-39.

Zammit finished his university studies and won his colours as Doctor of Medicine in June 1839 at 23 years of age.

===Liberal Phase (1838-1876)===

====First Writings====
During the suspension year at the [[Royal University of Malta]], Zammit might have composed and published a short tract entitled ''Pensieri Liberi di un Idiota sull'Interesse Mercantile'' ("Free Thoughts by an Idiot on the Interest in Merchandise").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During that same year (1838), up till around 1846, Zammit began contributing with some writings in Italian in ''Il Portafoglio Maltese'' (The Maltese Portfolio), a weekly paper issued by Paolo Sciortino.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Portelli|2000|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six years later, in 1845, Zammit left his home-town, [[Siggiewi]], and went to live at the capital city of [[Malta]], [[Valletta]], the political and social centre of the island. During that same year, he began to contribute some articles in ''L'Unione'' (The Union). This was a weekly paper issued by an Italian political refugee, [[Luigi Zuppetta]],&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/luigi-zuppetta/ (in Italian).&lt;/ref&gt; and edited by Enrico Naudi.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Portelli|2000|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper had been begun to be produced that same year (for the duration of just twelve months), and supported Maltese popular representation in government.

The following year, in 1846, Zammit probably began contributing also in the other papers, such as ''Giahan'' (Jahan), a satirical weekly in Maltese edited by Richard Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Portelli|2000|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During that same year, Zammit himself began issuing successively a three papers in Italian. The first, the fortnightly ''Il Foglio del Popolo'' (The People's Sheet), was begun on June 27, 1846.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Portelli|2000|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second, issued for the first time on August 1, 1846, was called ''La Rivista'' (The Magazine), and was published monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Portelli|2000|pp=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third, which was issued every ten days, was entitled ''La Fiammetta'' (The Little Torch), and was published for the first time on September 9, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Portelli|2000|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1848 and 1849, Zuppetta was also instrumental in issuing another weekly paper in Italian, ''Il Precursore'' (The Precursor),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Portelli|2000|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was edited by Salvatore Cumbo, a Catholic priest. Zammit seems to have contributed some writings also to this paper.

All of these works must be considered to be the first writings of Zammit's liberal intellectual phase.

====Zammit's Liberalism====
Zammit showed a favourable disposition towards his contemporary times and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Grech|1998|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, not without reservation. For instance, in spite of his attachment to people like Zuppetta – who was a member of ''[[Young Italy]] '' and an acquaintance of [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] – Zammit did not share these Italian refugees' anticlericalism. Nor did he think that any eventual opposition to the Church could help the Maltese cause to attain popular representation in government.

Zammit was la liberal Catholic. Like so many of his contemporaries, in mid-1846, at the time of the ascension to the [[Holy See]] of [[Pope Pius IX]], which was seen as a choice in favour of [[liberalism]], Zammit was overjoyed. Initially the pope did not disappoint him. He granted a general political amnesty, began an administrative, legal and financial reform of the [[Roman Curia]], and relaxed Church censure. This looked promising enough. In 1848, the pope went as far as issuing a new constitution which took the unprecedented step of establishing a two-chamber parliament for the [[papal states]].

Lashing out at conservatives, Zammit proudly wore the pope's reforms like a feature in his cap. He mercilessly criticised the British colonial government in [[Malta]], and was all out in favour of [[Italian unification]] (as the pope himself had been at the time). Zammit had no two minds that [[liberalism]] was 'the principle by which every free society should breath'.&lt;ref&gt;''La Rivista'', August 1846, p. 3; quoted in {{harvp|Grech|1998|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[1848 revolutions]] throughout Europe, [[Pope Pius IX]] suddenly made a volte-face, vehemently opposing the Italian cause, and retracting most of the steps he had taken during the previous two years. Such a turnaround left people like Zammit in the cold. However, he still retained a strong belief in the ''[[Idea of Progress]]'', political and social as much industrial, technological, scientific and artistic. Zammit wholeheartedly shared most of his contemporaries' enthusiasm for growth, development and advancement.

Zammit believed that [[liberalism]] – this champion of freedom and free enterprise – was by far the best tool to usher the forward stride of Progress.

====Partnership with the British====
Though somewhat disappointed with the pope, Zammit never succumbed to any anticlerical sentiments. Alternatively, he concentrated more on giving a push to the propitious wagon of Progress by beginning a long and close association with the British authorities in [[Malta]]. This was around 1949, when the British administration granted a Maltese elected popular representation in the council of government. To people with Zammit's frame of mind, this was enough to endorse British colonial rule.

On its part, government showed itself acquiescent to this new-found affection. In 1849, Zammit was appointed Assistant Superintendent and senior medial doctor of the local civil prisons at Corradino, [[Paola, Malta|Paola]]. He occupied this position for five years, up till 1854. During the same period, Zammit was also appointed Senior Supervisor of Aqueducts all over the [[Maltese islands]].

Zammit's work with the British government included important projects which were intended to improve [[Malta]]'s water supply and also the overall drainage system.

====Teaching Career and more Publications====
In the meantime, Zammit was also engaged with academic endeavours. Apart from lecturing at the [[Royal University of Malta]] at Valletta, he actively participated in meetings of intellectuals, artists or craftsmen. In 1864, for instance, he was chosen to be the first Deputy President of the Society for Sciences and Letters. Zammit's talk on the launching of the society was later published as ''Per l'Apertura della Società Maltese di Scienze e Lettere'' ("Opening of the Society for Sciences and Letters").&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the university, he lectured on philosophy, but also on other related subjects, such as art, architectural design, and technology.

In 1852, the same year in which – at 37 years of age – he married Melita Schranz (the sister of the renowned painter John Schranz) at the church of St. Paul's Shipwreck, [[Valletta]], Zammit composed a work in Italian entitled ''Primo Sviluppo e Primi Progressi dell'Umana Cognizione'' ("The Basic Development and Early Development of Human Knowledge").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, pp. 118-119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the next twenty years, while keeping up with his medical, academic, artistic, and social life, Zammit published a string of publications which dealt with a number of topics (all reviewed below). In some way or another, all of them have some interest for the study of philosophy. For each publication sort of reveals a little bit more of Zammit's intellectual life and curiosity.

Some of these publications are religious in a social, and perhaps even anthropological, kind of way. These include ''Memorie del Centenario del Naufragio di San Paolo Apostolo'' ("Recollections of the Centenary of the Shipwreck of St. Paul Apostle"; 1858),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Divota Novena'' ("Holy Novena"; 1868),&lt;ref name="Montebello_2_274"&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 274}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Il Transito Glorioso'' ("The Glorious Death"; 1872).&lt;ref name="Montebello_2_274"/&gt;

Other writings deal with industry, engineering and technological matters with a pronounced emphasis on social life and the environment, writings like ''Richerche Idrauliche'' ("Hydraulic Investigations"; 1855),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 141}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Esposizione di Industria Maltese'' ("An Exposition of Maltese Industry"; 1864),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 244}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Malte et son Industrie'' ("Malta and its Industries"1867),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 245}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Drenaggio'' ("The Drainage System"; 1875).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, pp. 134-135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some others are of an artistic nature, such as ''Angelica o La Sposa della Mosta'' ("Angelica or The Mosta Spouse"; 1861),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Friggieri|1979|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the periodical ''L'Arte'' ("Art"; 1862–66).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, ''La Fenice'' ("The Phoenician") was another periodical which Zammit issued (1872–76), dealing with current affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservative Phase (1876-1899)===

====Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy====
In 1875, at the age of sixty, Zammit was appointed professor to hold the chair of philosophy at the [[Royal University of Malta]]. The promotion came into effect at the beginning of the following year. He succeeded the Italian, Nicola Crescimanno (1803–1885), a judge and philosopher who had fled to [[Malta]] to escape persecution after the [[unification of Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 99}}. Not to be confused with the painter Nicola F. Crescimanno (1845-1909)&lt;/ref&gt; and who had been Dean since 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This employment seems to have sealed Zammit's definitive abandonment of his liberal views. Of course, this did not come abruptly. Various writings from the liberal phase attest to budding doubts and almost imperceptible shifts of positions. Nevertheless, it appears that it was only now that the swing – for a swing it was, considering his early and latter intellectual positions – seemed to set wholly in place.

Zammit's work as Dean was characterised by a thorough commitment to his academic and intellectual responsibilities. Though the prevailing system taught there was the [[Thomistic]] one, Zammit sought to widen the horizon of studies to include an intelligent concern with contemporary issues, such as those related to technology, empirical sciences and art.

====Zammit's Conservatism====
During this latter intellectual phase, Zammit's [[liberalism]] gave way to a more pessimistic, unadventurous and polemical approach to modern ideas and events.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Grech|1998|pp=9–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Religion became more and more important in his writings. His attitude towards most modern philosopher became markedly negative and apologetic.

There seem to be a number of reasons to explain why Zammit's liberal period could not last. One might mention the definitive opposition of the [[Catholic Church]], and particularly [[Pope Pius IX]], to all types of [[liberalism]]. It would surely have been a rather delicate affair in those times for someone to try to reconcile [[liberalism]] and allegiance to the Church, especially in ultra-conservative [[Malta]].

Besides, in Maltese society there was no class which vied for liberal reforms. The Church was satisfied with the status quo. The higher classes wanted a share of power for themselves, not universal franchise. The reforms reluctantly brought about by the British colonial government were piecemeal and only dictated by necessity. They were on the whole disinclined to share power with the locals.

The rest of the population was made up mostly of peasants who lacked an essential condition for class consciousness, that is, a basic sense of common interest and shared opposition to other groups. The lack of class consciousness on the part of the peasants could be seen in their resistance to reforms abrogating the wheat tax, through which they were subjected to an unfair payment of tax, suggested by the Royal Commissioner, F.W. Rowsell, in 1877. On the contrary, the peasants supported the richer members of society who stood to lose by the suggested reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Frendo, ''Party Politics in a Fortress Colony'', [[Msida]], Malta, 1991, p. 18; quoted in {{harvp|Grech|1998|pp=9–11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zammit's alliance with the establishment is underlined by his occupation of the chair of philosophy at the university. To be elected to such a position, the approval of both the British authorities and the local ecclesiastical hierarchy was needed.

====Academic and Intellectual Work====
At the [[Royal University of Malta]], Zammit was very much appreciated, and even loved, by the students. Of course, most of these hailed from the middle-upper and upper classes, and Zammit seems to have felt a sense of deep responsibility in guiding them to conserve those values which safeguarded the current social system. The main interest to which he draws his students' attention seems to have been the improvement of the current way of doing things, both politically and socially, rather than perceiving its unfairness and inequalities or, much less, changing it.

This can be seen in Zammit's writings such as ''Prolusione al Corso di Filosofija'' ("Inauguration of the Philosophy Course"; 1877),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 121}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''All'Occasione del Conferimento della Laurea'' ("For the Graduation Ceremony"; 1877),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Al Rinnovamento del Corso Accademico di Filosofija 1879-82'' ("For the Renewal of the Academic Course in Philosophy 1879-82"; 1879),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, pp. 146-147}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dio e la Suola'' ("God and Learning"; 1881),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 122}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dio e la Vita'' ("God and Life"; 1883),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, pp. 122-123}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''In Morte del Prof. Arciprete Antonio Albanese D.D.'' ("On the Death of Prof. Archpriest Antonio Albanese D.D."; 1885),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Alla Classe di Filosofia'' ("To the Philosophy Class"; 1886).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 79-80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most, if not all, of these have a decidedly paternalistic attitude very congruous with the times, and bear to Zammit's positive abandonment of any liberal sentiments.

Whereas formerly Zammit had been very critical towards aristocrats, now he seemed to be propane in seeing them as the moral bulwark of society. This can be seen in writings such as ''La Contessa Maria Sonia Sciberras Bologna'' ("The Countess Maria Sonia Sciberras Bologna"; 1878),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 159}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''All'Occasione della Solenne Apertura del Conservatorio Vincenzo Bugeja'' ("On the Occasion of the Official Opening of the Vincenzo Bugeja Charitable Institution"; 1880),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, pp. 89-90}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Di Francesco Saverio Schembri'' ("About Francesco Saverio Schembri"; 1880),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 158}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Il Conservatorio Vincenzo Bugeja'' ("The Vincenzo Bugeja Charitable Institution"; 1883).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In matters of religion, Zammit could not have become more conventional. In ''Ai Funerali di [[Pio IX]]'' ("For the Funeral of [[Pius IX]]"; 1878)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 100}}&lt;/ref&gt; he excused the pope for his failures. Moreover, when it came to religion Zammit seems to have chosen of take a within-the-walls stance, preferring now to look too much to the philosophical possibility that opposing views might have a point after all. In 1883, at his home-town, [[Siggiewi]], Zammit founded the St. Nicholas Philharmonic Society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freewebs.com/bandasannikola/storja.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline and death===
After all his vicissitudes, it appears that Zammit did not seem to want to leave the world without giving voice to his beliefs and concerns. This he did in his final writing – and the magnum opus of his conservative intellectual phase – which he named ''Pensieri d'un Retrogrado'' ("Reflections of Old Hand"1888).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, pp. 83-86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After published this tome, Zammit retained his post at the [[Royal University of Malta]] for two more years, up till 1890. He now had seventy-five years of age, and had been Dean for the last fifteen of those. Zammit was succeeded by [[Francis Bonnici]].

On his retirement, as a sign of gratitude the British government granted Zammit an annual pension of a hundred pounds (considerable for those days). He spent his last years in relative withdrawal at his residence at [[Sliema]], Malta.

He died at home on July 29, 1899, at the age of eighty-three. His funeral procession began at [[Sliema]] and proceeded to [[Siggiewi]], where he had been born, and laid to rest at the cemetery there. A journalist who was at the funeral later commented that, considering the stature of the deceased, 'too few people, walking silently, accompanied the coffin'.&lt;ref&gt;''Malta'', July 1899; quoted in {{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 274}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Zammit's writings are more or less all relevant for the study and appreciation of his philosophy. The major ones, of course, take pride of place. Nevertheless, all the others should not be discarded, as they offer glimpses, something quite important, into the mind and personality of the philosopher.

===Major writings===

* ''Per l'Apertura della Società Maltese di Scienze e Lettere'' ("Opening of the Society for Sciences and Letters"; 1864).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{harvp|Grech|1998|pp=6–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; – Printed at the Albion Press, [[Malta]], and containing 35 pages, this little tract might stand as a typical composition relative to Zammit's liberal phase. The work reproduces the talk which Zammit gave at the launching of the said society on October 22, 1864. In the address, Zammit gave a positive account of the arts and sciences of his times. Art and science were responsible for the qualitative improvement man experienced in modern times, he states. Zammit pointed out to the need that science should always be considered in connection with industry. He stressed that academia should not be just intellectual clubs, but should also give a positive contribution to society. In the discourse, on can find a lot of [[empiricist]] and [[utilitarian]] innuendoes.

:British influence emerges in Zammit's expressed admiration towards the British political and economic systems and way of life. In politics, Zammit favoured an [[empiricist]] 'down to earth' approach, rather than any hazy political idealism or utopianism. He showed an [[empiricist]] dislike of theory, possessing a favourable disposition towards men of action.

:In [[positivist]] fashion, Zammit attributed Britain's dominant economic and political position to its industries.

:Zammit also regarded favourably French intellectuals. Together with their British counterparts, they are labelled 'enlightened' because, Zammit insists, they helped man in his technological and intellectual progress.

:In his discourse, Zammit also talked in upbeat terms about popular democracy. Arts and sciences, he says, should have a popular and democratic function. Zammit stated that one of the aims of literature is to prepare people for plebiscite. It is clear that his liberal assumptions led him to believe in the people's ability to make good, rational judgements, thus maintaining the possibility of improving social and political situations. He claimed that literature should be a connecting link between people and their intellectuals, rather than something reserved to some elite.

:With regards to the thinkers mentioned in the talk, [[Aristotle]] has none of the respect he shall later enjoy in Zammit's conservative phase, as can be seen, for instance, in ''Pensieri d'un Retrogrado''. Indeed, [[Aristotle]]'s legacy is considered as a grudge. Science could only develop, Zammit maintains, by freeing itself from it.

:Zammit was also for the reconciliation of religion and science. In this respect, it is also important to note that in this talk religion does not feature as much as it does in his later, conservative works.

* ''Pensieri d'un Retrogrado'' ("Reflections of an Old Hand"; 1888) – Published by Tipografia Industriale of Giovanni Muscat, [[Malta]], the book contains 425 pages of packed text. The composition represents the height of Zammit's thought relative to his conservative intellectual phase. [[St. Augustine]] takes pride of place when it comes to the intellectual sources of the work, calling for a revival of his philosophical approach.

:In the book, Zammit deals with some 125 different themes divided in five groups of a more or less philosophical, moral, social, scientific/literary, and Christian nature.

:In the introduction, Zammit states that ''arrivati a conclusioni impossibili, rigettate le tradizioni della verità non si può più che fermarsi, che retrocedere per progredire. Rinnegare il passato per un presente che non lo vale ed un futuro che minaccia, accettare una luce che acceca è una stoltezza nella civiltà'' ('having come to impossible conclusions, refusing the traditions of truth, it cannot be otherwise that we stop, that we retreat in order to advance. Refusing the past for a worthless present and a threatening future, embracing a blinding light, is madness for society). The book, Zammit declares, ''ci ricordi modestamente i nostri errori, le nostre speranze e i nostri destini' (modestly reminds us of our errors, our hopes, and out destinies).

:Zammit demonstrates an uncommon intensity throughout the work. He writes with conviction and persuasiveness, almost provocation. Nevertheless, the book, though formally complex, lacks unity. It seems that the various parts were put together sporadically. Sometimes there is no attempt at giving them some kind of amalgamated unified form. Nevertheless, the work as a whole is staggering. It deals with natural philosophy, metaphysics, the decadent nature of modern humans, the passions, and so many other themes.

:Despite its depth, in general the work contains little philosophical originality.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Grech|1998|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its uniqueness seems to lie in its transitory nature; in upholding and advocating, that is, a change from a [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] way of looking at philosophy and the world to the perspective championed by [[St. Augustine]].

:Nevertheless, the main thrust of Zammit's book is destructive. In line with other early and mid-19th century Christian apologists, he might indeed be called 'irrational'. Not because he denies man's rational nature or capacities, but rather because he denies any claim that rationality may provide a sufficient explanation of humans' ability to arrive at theoretical or moral heights through his own rational powers.

:Still, Zammit's work has characteristics which differentiate him from that of other 19th century apologists and draws him nearer to the [[neo-Scholastic]] way of thinking.

===All writings in chronological order===
It would be a mistake to study Zammit by reading just one single publication of his, namely the ''Pensieri d'un Retrogrado'', as is commonly done. This will only provide a distorted view of the man's philosophy. Furthermore, even if it represents his thought during the final part of his life, it surely excludes his whole liberal phase completely. The list below includes all known works by Zammit. It should serve at least as an indication of the historically broad spread of his writings.

==Works of structural engineering and artistic design==
Zammit was very much involved with commissions of design. Invariably, these were contracted by religious circles. Though some of them entailed relatively small, minor embellishments and adornments, others, such as the architectonic assignments, comprised large tasks.

===Churches===
All of the following churches are situated in [[Malta]]. It is as yet unknown whether Zammit was ever commissioned to work on other churches abroad.

* Façade of the church of St. Catherine, [[Zurrieq]] (1861)
* Naves and portico of the church of St. Nicholas, [[Siggiewi]] (1862)
* Structural alterations to the church of Our Lady of Graces, [[Zabbar]] (1875)
* Façade of the church of St. Publius, [[Floriana]] (1885)
* Façade of the church of St. Paul Shipwreck, [[Valletta]] (1886)
* Restoration of the church of St. Peter, [[Marsaxlokk]]
* Plan and design for the church of Our Lady of Victories, [[Naxxar]] – ''Unimplemented''

===Memorials===
''Unfortunately, a complete and detailed list of the following is as yet unavailable.''

* Plan and design of various memorial or funerary chapels at the Addolorata Cemetery, [[Paola, Malta|Paola]], Malta.

===Artistic design===
''Regrettably, this list here is almost certainly not exhaustive.''

* The frontal for the major altar, the canopy, the ceiling decorations, the floor adornment, and all the festive liturgical paraphernalia at the church of the [[Immaculate Conception]], [[Cospicua]]
* The festive pillar for the statue of [[Pope Pius IX]], [[Cospicua]]
* The floor adornment at the church of [[St. Catherine of Alexandria]], [[Zejtun]]
* The canopy, the festive liturgical paraphernalia, and the choir stalls at the church of St. George, [[Qormi]]
* The main canopy at the cathedral of the [[archbishop]], [[Mdina]]
* The frontal for the major altar, and various items of the festive liturgical paraphernalia at the church of St. Nicholas, [[Siggiewi]]
* The triumphal arch for St. Paul's Street, [[Valletta]], for the XVIII centenary of St. Paul's Shipwreck (1858) – ''Not in use any more''
* The coat of arms of various villages, towns and cities around [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]]– ''most still in use today by the [[local councils of Malta]]''
* Good Friday catafalque at the church of the [[Franciscans]], [[Valletta]] (1870)
* The pulpit for the church of St. Michael, [[Mqabba]]

==Appreciation==
Within philosophical circles, Zammit has been sometimes taken lightly.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Serracino Inglott and Claude Mangion, 'Il-Filosofija f'Malta', ''Oqsma tal-Kultura Maltija'', ed. by T. Cortis, [[Zabbar]], 1991, pp. 269f.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been mainly due to the fact that most are ''only'' acquainted to his ''Pensieri d'un Retrogrado''. Indeed, reading this work ''without'' any or scant knowledge of the rest of his literary output cannot but thoroughly distort Zammit's philosophical output and significance. ''Both'' his liberal and conservative phases must be taken into consideration to form a balanced and holistic view of his philosophy.

To date, a methodical and comprehensive appreciation of Zammit's philosophy has still not been done. Though the research and studies of Jimmy Xerri&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Xerri|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael Grech&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grech|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; come close, they might still have lacked a consideration of Zammit's philosophy in its entirety.

Most certainly, Zammit is not a philosopher to be discarded. His broad knowledge, together with his curiosity and perplexities, not only make his works interesting and intriguing, but they also can still engage contemporary philosophers in avid and profitable discussions.

'''Norman Malcolm''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|l|k|ə|m}}; 11 June 1911 &amp;ndash; 4 August 1990) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosophy|philosopher]].

==Life==
Malcolm was born in [[Selden, Kansas]]. He studied philosophy with [[O.K. Bouwsma]] at the [[University of Nebraska]], then enrolled as a graduate student at [[Harvard University]] in 1933.

At [[Cambridge University]] in 1938-9, he met [[George Edward Moore|G. E. Moore]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Malcolm attended Wittgenstein's lectures on the [[philosophy|philosophical]] foundations of [[mathematics]] throughout 1939 and remained one of Wittgenstein's closest friends. Malcolm's memoir of his time with Wittgenstein, published in 1958, is widely acclaimed as one of the most captivating and most accurate portraits of Wittgenstein's remarkable personality.

After serving in the [[United States Navy]] from 1942 to 1945, Malcolm, with his wife, Leonida, and their son, Raymond Charles Malcolm, resided in Cambridge again in 1946-47.  He saw a good deal of Wittgenstein during that time, and they continued to correspond frequently thereafter. In 1947,  Malcolm joined the faculty at [[Cornell University]], where he taught until his retirement. In 1949, Wittgenstein was a guest of the Malcolms in [[Ithaca, New York]].  In that year Malcolm introduced [[O.K. Bouwsma]] to Wittgenstein. Bouwsma remained close to Wittgenstein until Wittgenstein's death in 1951.

In 1959, his book ''Dreaming'' was published, in which he elaborated on Wittgenstein's question as to whether it really mattered if people who tell dreams "really had these images while they slept, or whether it merely seems so to them on waking". This work was also a response to Descartes' ''Meditations''.[http://auden.webster.edu/~sekosha/pastor.htm]

Other than that he is known for propagating the view that [[common sense]] philosophy and [[ordinary language]] philosophy are the same. He was generally supportive of [[George Edward Moore|Moore's]] theory of knowledge and certitude, though he found Moore's style and method of arguing to be ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Malcolm (1952), "Moore and Ordinary Language", ''The Philosophy 
of G. E. Moore''&lt;/ref&gt; His critique of Moore's articles on skepticism (and also on Moore's '[[Here is a hand]]' argument) lay the foundation for the renewed interest in common sense philosophy and [[ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language philosoph]]y.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames (2003) "Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume II: The Age of Meaning." ''Chapter 7''&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm was also a defender of a [[Modal logic|modal]] version of the [[ontological argument]]. In 1960 he argued that the argument originally presented by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] in the second chapter of his ''[[Proslogion]]'' was just an inferior version of the argument propounded in chapter three.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Malcolm (1960), "Anselm's Ontological Arguments," ''Philosophical Review'', '''69''':41&amp;ndash;62.&lt;/ref&gt; His argument is similar to those produced by [[Charles Hartshorne]] and [[Alvin Plantinga]]. Malcolm argued that a God cannot simply exist as a matter of contingency but rather must exist in necessity if at all. He argued that if God exists in contingency then his existence is subject to a series of conditions that would then be greater than God and this would be a contradiction (referring to Anselm's definition of God as That than which Nothing Greater can be Conceived).

'''Oets Kolk Bouwsma''' (1898–1978) was an [[American philosopher]] born of Dutch-American parents in [[Muskegon, Michigan]].

==Education and early career==
He was educated at [[Calvin College]] and at the [[University of Michigan]].  In his early years he was an advocate of [[idealism]], but later found the work of [[G. E. Moore]]’s common sense counters to [[skepticism]] more appealing to his inclinations.  Still, he was critical of Moore.  He developed his own technique of [[analysis]] that focused on uncovering hidden analogies driving Moore’s ways of speaking about [[sense data]].  He worked intensely on Moore, publishing a significant paper, “Moore’s Theory of Sense-Data,” which was eventually included in the [[Library of Living Philosophers]] volume on Moore.  The essay reflected the beginnings of a method of philosophical analysis that was soon to be forged by his reading of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

==Later career==
Engaged in Moore’s philosophy, Bouwsma sent students from the [[University of Nebraska]], most notably [[Morris Lazerowitz]], to study with Moore at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]].  Lazerowitz’s wife [[Alice Ambrose]], a student of Wittgenstein as well as Moore, introduced Bouwsma to Wittgenstein’s revolutionary ideas in “[[Blue and Brown Books|The Blue Book]].”  [[Norman Malcolm]], another of Bouwsma’s students, became a prominent interpreter and presenter of Wittgenstein’s ideas in America, after studying with Wittgenstein at Cambridge.  Malcolm, who later taught at [[Cornell University|Cornell]], was able to persuade Wittgenstein to visit there.  Simultaneously, Malcolm arranged for Bouwsma to teach at Cornell during Wittgenstein’s visit.  By that time, in 1949, Bouwsma had absorbed the implications of Wittgenstein’s philosophy in The Blue Book.  With a leave from the University of Nebraska and a [[Fulbright Fellowship]], he was able to spend much of the next two years discussing philosophy with Wittgenstein at Cornell, [[Smith College]], and [[Oxford University|Oxford]].  Through Wittgenstein, Bouwsma developed an understanding of what he had been groping for in his work on Moore.

After the personal influence of Wittgenstein and much hard work on ''The Blue Book'' and ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', Bouwsma emerged with a unique method of philosophical analysis that he applied to a variety of philosophical problems.   He continued to attack the skepticism of [[Descartes]] that reflected the idealism from which Bouwsma fought to free himself.  Applying Wittgenstein’s radical turn of displaying the nonsense in place of refuting a philosophical theory, he turned to Berkeley’s idealism where he teased the failure to make sense of ideas as entities in the mind out into the open.  With a focus on the opening question of ''The Blue Book'' on meaning, he wrote tirelessly on the idea of “meaning as use,” until he shook himself loose of the notion that Wittgenstein was presenting another philosophical theory of meaning.  He came to understand and appropriate the idea that Wittgenstein had developed a set of techniques to arm the philosopher in the struggle against the “bewitchment of his intelligence by means of language.”  This understanding culminated in Bouwsma’s accomplished article, “The Blue Book,” which described the aims of the new method of philosophical analysis.  With such perennial conceptually puzzling concepts as “time,” “truth,” and “thinking,” he carefully and often humorously compared sentences of philosophers with   actual sentences of daily life – earning Bouwsma a notable place in what came to be called “ordinary language philosophy.”  With this reputation, [[Gilbert Ryle]] asked Bouwsma to deliver the first of the famous [[John Locke Lectures]] at Oxford University.

With a lifelong attachment to the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed Church]], Bouwsma philosophically engaged the concepts of Christianity.  Applying his acquired techniques of philosophical analysis, he carefully distinguished the uses of the word “belief” in religious settings from uses in non-religious settings.  When called upon in philosophy to illuminate puzzling Christian concepts, he drew on his lifelong participation in the community of faith and on his reading of the Scriptures to dramatically bring to life their meaning.  In addition to Wittgenstein, his work on Kierkegaard was the other great influence in Bouwsma’s philosophical development.  He came to understand the significance of [[Kierkegaard]]’s concept of “subjectivity” for thinking philosophically about Christianity.  On the one hand, “subjectivity” points to understanding the language of religion in the context of particular religious communities – an idea parallel to Wittgenstein’s idea of understanding words and sentences in language-games and forms of life.  On the other hand, “subjectivity” makes clear that Christianity is an invitation to new life and not an objective system of metaphysics.  His papers in the philosophy of religion are collected separately in a volume with the title, ''Without Proof or Evidence'', published by the [[University of Nebraska Press]].

With a fine ear for expression, Bouwsma fastened on poetry, [[James Joyce]]’s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' and ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', [[Shakespeare]], [[Dickens]], and novelists who artistically capture the expressions of ordinary language.  In this regard he reflected often on the writing and reading of literature.  He wrote and lectured on the “truth” of poetry, emphasizing its aesthetic value as opposed to its moral value.  He also wrote on the puzzling relationship of words to music in “The Expression Theory of Art.”  Extensive marginal notes filling his copies of ''Ulysses'' and ''Finnegans Wake'' indicate how consumed he was by Joyce’s word play and how he appropriated a sensitivity to word play in his own writing style.

Bouwsma taught philosophy at the University of Nebraska from 1928 until 1965 and the [[University of Texas]] from 1965 until 1977.  His greatest influence came, not so much through his humorously and finely written essays, but through the many graduate students he trained in his unique style of exploring the borderlands of sense and nonsense in philosophical sentences.  Although he wrote incessantly and presented numerous papers, he published only one book toward the end of his career – a collection of essays titled ''Philosophical Essays''.  He died in 1978.  His papers and daily notebooks, the latter filling hundreds of legal pads, are housed in the [[Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]] at The University of Texas, Austin.  J.L. Craft and Ronald E. Hustwit Sr. co-edited and published two additional volumes of his papers and selections of his [[commonplace book]].  His notebooks recording his discussions with Wittgenstein, published with the title, ''Wittgenstein Conversations, 1949-51'', have become a primary source for Wittgenstein studies.

'''''Philosophical Problems of Space and Time''''' (1963; second edition 1973) is a book about the nature of space and time by the philosopher [[Adolf Grünbaum]]. It is recognized as a major work in the philosophy of the natural sciences.

==Summary==
{{expand section|date=October 2018}}
Grünbaum discusses the scientific and mathematical fields of [[geometry]], [[chronometry]], and [[geochronometry]]. He also provides an account of the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687) of the physicist [[Isaac Newton]], as well as the work of other physicists such as [[Albert Einstein]], and that of the mathematician [[Bernhard Riemann]]. He criticizes the views of the philosophers [[Ernest Nagel]] and [[Jacques Maritain]], arguing that in ''[[The Structure of Science]]'' (1961) Nagel misinterprets the philosopher of science [[Henri Poincaré]] and that in ''[[The Degrees of Knowledge]]'' (1932) Maritain presents an unsound and incorrect interpretation of the nature of geometry.{{sfn|Grünbaum|1974|pages=1, 4, 8, 12, 91, 138, 148–150}}

==Publication history==
''Philosophical Problems of Space and Time'' was first published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in the United States in 1963. In 1964, the book was published by [[Routledge|Routledge and Kegan Paul]] in the United Kingdom. In 1969, a revised version was published in Russian translation in the Soviet Union by [[Progress Publishers]]. In 1973, an enlarged section was published in English by [[D. Reidel|D. Reidel Publishing Company]].{{sfn|Grünbaum|1974|pages=iv, xvii}}

==Reception==
Robert S. Cohen and the philosopher [[Marx W. Wartofsky]] stated in the second edition of ''Philosophical Problems of Space and Time'' that the book was "promptly recognized to be one of the few major works in the philosophy of the natural sciences of this generation" upon its original publication. They believed that this was partly because Grünbaum showed devotion to both "actual science and philosophical understanding" and combined "detail with scope." They credited him with dealing with the "problems of space and time" in their "full depth and complexity".{{sfn|Cohen|Wartofsky|1974|page=xiii}} The philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] described ''Philosophical Problems of Space and Time'' as the most comprehensive discussion of [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean space]] in ''Modern Philosophy: An Introduction and Survey'' (1994), though he added that the work was "far from inviting".{{sfn|Scruton|1997|page=572}} The philosopher [[Philip L. Quinn]] called Grünbaum's thesis about physical geometry and chronometry "striking" in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'' (2005).{{sfn|Quinn|2005|page=355}}

'''Psychological nominalism''' is the view advanced in [[Wilfrid Sellars]]' paper "Empiricism and Philosophy of Mind" (EPM) that explains psychological concepts in terms of public language use.  Sellars describes psychological nominalism as the view that “all awareness of sorts, resemblances, facts, etc., in short, all awareness…is a linguistic affair.”

Judging solely from the mention in EPM, Psychological Nominalism would seem to be a form of Verbal Behaviorism, which holds that ascriptions of psychological states are definitionally equivalent to predictions about behavior.  For example, the [[verbal behavior|Verbal Behaviorist]] holds that a statement like "John is scared of thunderstorms" is meaningful only insofar as it can be parsed into predictions concerning the sorts of things John is likely to say and/or do in the event of a thunderstom (i.e. "John will say, or have a propensity to say, "I am scared" when he hears thunder" or "John will hide, or have a propensity to hide, his face when he sees lightning").

Psychological Nominalism extends the Verbal Behaviorist's explanation of psychological states (like fear, love, desire, thinking etc.) to cognitive states (being aware, knowing, etc.)  while denying the premise that [[falsifiability]] criteria can give statements their meaning.  The Psychological Nominalist concedes that survival of mental terminology in natural language can be explained in terms of the practical utility of mental-state ascriptions, but denies that this constitutes an analysis of the meaning of any particular mental-state ascription because the Psychological Nominalist contends that the meaning of any term, mental or otherwise, is irreducibly bound with its usage.  Thus, the Verbal Behaviorist fails to give a completely philosophically satisfying account of psychological statements because he fails to recognize that the linguistic statements are themselves meaningful in light of the kinds of behavior associated with them.

'''Qigong''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|iː|ˈ|ɡ|ɒ|ŋ}}),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/qigong "qigong"]. ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; '''qi gong''', '''chi kung''', or '''chi gung''' ({{zh|t=氣功|s=气功|p=qìgōng|w=ch‘i kung|l=Life Energy Cultivation}}) is a [[holistic]] system of coordinated body posture and movement, breathing, and meditation used for the purposes of health, spirituality, and martial arts training.&lt;ref name="nccih2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tai Chi and Qi Gong: In Depth|url=https://nccih.nih.gov/health/taichi/introduction.htm|publisher=National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, US National Institutes of Health|accessdate=10 February 2018|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With roots in Chinese [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|medicine]], [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]], and [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]], qigong is traditionally viewed as a practice to cultivate and balance [[qi]] (chi), translated as "life energy".&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt;

According to [[Taoism|Taoist]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], and [[Confucianism|Confucian]] philosophy, qigong allows access to higher realms of awareness, awakens one's "true nature", and helps develop human potential.&lt;ref name=LWW&gt;{{cite book|last1= Liang |first1= Shou-Yu | first2= Wen-Ching |last2= Wu |first3= Denise |last3= Breiter-Wu |year=1997|title= Qigong Empowerment: A Guide to Medical, Taoist, Buddhist, and Wushu Energy Cultivation |publisher= Way of the Dragon Pub |isbn=1-889659-02-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qigong practice typically involves moving meditation, coordinating slow flowing movement, deep rhythmic breathing, and calm meditative state of mind. Qigong is now practiced throughout China and worldwide for [[recreation]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]] and [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]], [[preventive medicine]] and [[self-healing]], [[alternative medicine]], [[Meditation|meditation and self-cultivation]], and [[Chinese martial arts|training for martial arts]].

Research concerning qigong has been conducted for a wide range of medical conditions, including [[hypertension]], [[pain]], and [[cancer]], and with respect to [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name=nccih2016/&gt; Most research concerning health benefits of qigong has been of poor quality, such that it would be unwise to draw firm conclusions at this stage.&lt;ref name=Lee2011/&gt;

==Etymology==
{{main|Qi|Chinese martial arts}}
Qigong ([[Pinyin]]), ch'i kung ([[Wade-Giles]]), and chi gung ([[Yale romanization of Mandarin|Yale]]) are English words for two Chinese characters: '''''qì''''' ('''[[wiktionary: 气|气]]'''／'''[[wiktionary: 氣|氣]]''') and '''''gōng''''' ('''[[wiktionary: 功|功]]''').

''[[Qi]]'' (or ''chi'') is often translated as life energy,&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite book|last= Cohen |first=K. S. | year=1999|title= The Way of Qigong: The Art and Science of Chinese Energy Healing |publisher= Random House of Canada |isbn=0-345-42109-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to energy circulating through the body; though a more general definition is universal energy, including heat, light, and electromagnetic energy;&lt;ref name=YJM1&gt;{{cite book|last= Yang |first= Jwing-Ming|year=1987|title= Chi Kung: health &amp; martial arts |publisher= Yang's Martial Arts Association |isbn=0-940871-00-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and definitions often involve breath, air, gas, or the relationship between matter, energy, and spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Ho |first= Peng Yoke|date=Oct 2000 |title= Li, Qi, and Shu: An Introduction to Science and Civilization in China |publisher= Dover Publications |isbn=0-486-41445-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qi is the central underlying principle in traditional Chinese [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicine]] and [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]]. ''Gong'' (or ''kung'') is often translated as cultivation or work, and definitions include practice, skill, mastery, merit, achievement, service, result, or accomplishment, and is often used to mean [[Kung fu (term)|gongfu]] (kung fu) in the traditional sense of achievement through great effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?wdqr=%E5%8A%9F MDBG dictionary entry for Gong]&lt;/ref&gt; The two words are combined to describe systems to cultivate and balance life energy, especially for health.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

Although the term qigong (氣功) has been traced back to [[Taoism|Daoist]] literature of the early [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907 AD), the term ''qigong'' as currently used was promoted in the late 1940s through the 1950s to refer to a broad range of Chinese self-cultivation exercises, and to emphasize [[Traditional Chinese medicine|health]] and [[History of science and technology in China|scientific]] approaches, while de-emphasizing [[Chinese alchemy|spiritual practices]], [[mysticism]], and elite lineages.&lt;ref name = Palmer&gt;{{cite book | last= Palmer |first= David A. | year=2007|title= Qigong fever: body, science, and utopia in China | publisher= Columbia University Press | isbn=0-231-14066-5 | chapter= | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = yeyoung_qigong_origin /&gt;&lt;ref name = Ownby&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ownby | first1 = David | title = Falun Gong and the future of China | year = 2008 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-532905-6 | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, knowledge about qigong was passed from adept master to student in elite unbroken lineages, typically with secretive and esoteric traditions of training and [[Oral tradition|oral transmission]],&lt;ref name = yeyoung_lineage_transmission&gt;{{cite web|last=YeYoung  |first=Bing | title= Lineage Transmission of Qi Gong | publisher = YeYoung Culture Studies: Sacramento, CA (http://literati-tradition.com) | url = http://literati-tradition.com/qi_gong_lineage.html | accessdate = 7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with an emphasis on meditative practice by scholars and gymnastic or dynamic practice by the working masses.&lt;ref name = miura_1989&gt;{{cite book | last= Miura | first = Kunio | year = 1989 | chapter = The Revival of Qi | editor = Livia Kohl (ed) | title = Taoist Meditation and Longevity Techniques | publisher= Center For Chinese Studies: University of Michigan, Ann Arbor | pages = | isbn = 0-89264-085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the late 1940s and the 1950s, the mainland Chinese government tried to integrate disparate qigong approaches into one coherent system, with the intention of establishing a firm scientific basis for qigong practice. In 1949, Liu Guizhen established the name "Qigong" to refer to the system of life preserving practices that he and his associates developed based on Dao yin and other philosophical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voigt|first=John|title=The Man Who Invented "Qigong"|journal=Qi: the Journal of Traditional Eastern Health &amp; Fitness|date=Autumn 2013|volume=23|issue=3|pages=28–33 |url=http://www.qigonginstitute.org/html/papers/The%20Man%20Who%20Invented%20Qigong-1.pdf |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attempt is considered by some [[Sinology|sinologists]] as the start of the modern or scientific interpretation of qigong.&lt;ref name=Otehode&gt;{{Cite book |last =Otehode | first =Utiraruto  | chapter= The Creation and Reemergence of Qigong in China |editor-last = Ashiwa | editor-first = Yoshiko | editor2-last = Wank | editor2-first= David L. | title = Making religion, making the state: the politics of religion in modern China | year = 2009 | publisher = Stanford University Press | location = Stanford, Calif.  | isbn = 978-0-8047-5842-0 | pages =241–265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Despeux &gt;{{cite book|last= Despeux |first=C. | year=1997|title= Le qigong, une expression de la modernité Chinoise.

After the Cultural Revolution, qigong, along with [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]], was popularized as daily morning exercise practiced en masse throughout China.

Popularity of qigong grew rapidly during the [[Deng Xiaoping|Deng]] and [[Jiang Zemin|Jiang]] eras after [[Mao Zedong|Mao Zedong's]] death in 1976 through the 1990s, with estimates of between 60 and 200 million practitioners throughout China.  Along with popularity and state sanction came controversy and problems: claims of extraordinary abilities bordering on the supernatural, [[pseudoscience]] explanations to build credibility,&lt;ref name=pseudoscience1&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Lin | first1 = Zixin | title = Qigong: Chinese medicine or pseudoscience | year = 2000 | publisher = Prometheus Books | location = Amherst, NY | isbn = 978-1-57392-232-6 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; a mental condition labeled [[qigong deviation]],&lt;ref name= Nancy /&gt; formation of cults, and exaggeration of claims by masters for personal benefit.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wanjek &gt;{{cite book|last= Wanjek |first= Christopher | year=2003| title= Bad medicine: misconceptions and misuses revealed, from distance healing to vitamin O |publisher= John Wiley and Sons| pages=182–187 |isbn=0-471-43499-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985, the state-run "National Qigong Science and Research Organization" was established to regulate the nation's qigong denominations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite book | last= Palmer |first= David A. | year=2007|title= Qigong fever: body, science, and utopia in China | publisher= Columbia University Press | isbn=0-231-14066-5 | pages = 59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, in response to widespread revival of old traditions of spirituality, morality, and mysticism, and perceived challenges to State control, the Chinese government took measures to enforce control of public qigong practice, including shutting down qigong clinics and hospitals, and banning groups such as [[Zhong Gong]] and [[Falun Gong]].&lt;ref name = Ownby/&gt;{{rp|161–174}}&lt;ref name = Penny&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Penny | first1 = Benjamin | chapter = Qigong, Daoism and Science: some contexts for the qigong boom |editor-last = Lee | editor-first = M. | editor2-last = Syrokomla-Stefanowska | editor2-first= A.D. | year = 1993 | title = Modernisation of the Chinese Past | publisher = Wild Peony | location = Sydney  | isbn = 978-0-86758-658-9 | pages = 166–179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the 1999 crackdown, qigong research and practice have only been officially supported in the context of health and traditional Chinese medicine. The Chinese Health Qigong Association, established in 2000, strictly regulates public qigong practice, with limitation of public gatherings, requirement of state approved training and certification of instructors, and restriction of practice to state-approved forms.&lt;ref name= Karchmer &gt;{{Cite book |last = Karchmer | first = Eric | chapter= Magic, Science and Qigong in Contemporary China |editor-last = Blum | editor-first = Susan Debra | editor2-last = Jensen | editor2-first= Lionel M | title = China off center: mapping the margins of the middle kingdom | year = 2002 | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | isbn = 978-0-8248-2577-5 | pages =311–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Scheid | first1 = Volker | title = Chinese medicine in contemporary China: plurality and synthesis | year = 2002 | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham, NC | isbn = 0-8223-2872-0 | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the forces of migration of the [[Chinese diaspora]], [[tourism in China]], and [[globalization]], the practice of qigong spread from the Chinese community to the world. Today, millions of people around the world practice qigong and believe in the benefits of qigong to varying degrees. Similar to its historical origin, those interested in qigong come from diverse backgrounds and practice it for different reasons, including for [[recreation]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]], [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]], [[preventive medicine]], [[self-healing]], [[alternative medicine]], [[Higher self|self-cultivation]], [[meditation]], [[spirituality]], and [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts training]].

==Overview==

===Practices===

Qigong comprises a diverse set of practices that coordinate body (調身), breath (調息), and mind (調心) based on Chinese philosophy.&lt;ref name="A Standard Guide on Qigong 气功标准教程"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Yang | first1 = Bai Long 杨柏龙 | title = A Standard Guide on Qigong 气功标准教程 | year =2006 | publisher = Beijing Sport University Press 北京体育大学出版社 | location =  | isbn = 9787811005400 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Lam Kam-Chuen | first1 = Master | last2 = Lam | first2 = Kam Chuen | title = The way of energy: mastering the Chinese art of internal strength with chi kung exercise | year = 1991 | publisher = Simon Schuster | location = New York  | isbn = 978-0-671-73645-3 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Practices include moving and still meditation, massage, chanting, sound meditation, and non-contact treatments, performed in a broad array of body postures. Qigong is commonly classified into two foundational categories: 1) dynamic or active qigong (dong gong), with slow flowing movement; and 2) meditative or passive qigong (jing gong), with still positions and inner movement of the breath.&lt;ref name=Micozzi2010/&gt;{{rp|21770–21772}} From a therapeutic perspective, qigong can be classified into two systems:
1) internal qigong, which focuses on self-care and self-cultivation, and;
2) external qigong, which involves treatment by a therapist who directs or transmits qi.&lt;ref name=Micozzi2010/&gt;{{rp|21777–21781}}

As moving meditation, qigong practice typically coordinates slow stylized movement, deep diaphragmatic breathing, and calm mental focus, with visualization of guiding qi through the body. While implementation details vary, generally qigong forms can be characterized as a mix of four types of practice: dynamic, static, meditative, and activities requiring external aids.

* Dynamic practice
: involves fluid movement, usually carefully choreographed, coordinated with breath and awareness. Examples include the slow stylized movements of [[T'ai chi ch'uan]], [[Baguazhang]], and [[Xing Yi Quan]].&lt;ref name = yang_taiji&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Yang | first1 = Jwing-Ming | title = The Essence of Taiji Qigong, Second Edition : The Internal Foundation of Taijiquan (Martial Arts-Qigong) | year =1998  | publisher = YMAA Publication Center | location =  | isbn = 978-1-886969-63-6 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include graceful movement that mimics the motion of animals in Five Animals ([[Wu Qin Xi|Wu Qin Xi qigong]]),&lt;ref name=five_animals1&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fick | first1 = Franklin | title = Five Animal Frolics Qi Gong: Crane and Bear Exercises | year =2005 | publisher = Lulu.com | location =  | isbn = 978-1-4116-2776-5 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; White Crane,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Clark | first1 = Angus | title = Secrets of Qigong (Secrets of) | year = 2003 | publisher = Evergreen | location =  | isbn = 978-3-8228-0967-9 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wild Goose (Dayan) Qigong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Zhang | first1 = Hong-Chao | title = Wild Goose Qigong: Natural Movement for Healthy Living | year =2000  | publisher = YMAA Publication Center | location =  | isbn = 978-1-886969-78-0 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

* Static practice
: involves holding postures for sustained periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Diepersloot|first=Jan| year=2000|title= The Tao of Yiquan: The Method of Awareness in the Martial Arts|publisher= Center For Healing &amp; The Arts|isbn=0-9649976-1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases this bears resemblance to the practice of [[Yoga]] and its continuation in the Buddhist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Dumoulin | first1 = Heinrich | last2 = Heisig | first2 = James W. | last3 = McRae | first3 = John M. | last4 = Knitter | first4 = Paul F. | title = Zen Buddhism: a history | year = 2005 | publisher = World Wisdom | location = Bloomington, Ind.  | isbn = 978-0-941532-89-1 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example [[Yiquan]], a Chinese martial art derived from [[xingyiquan]], emphasizes static stance training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Dong | first1 = Paul | last2 = Raffill | first2 = Thomas | title = Empty Force: The Power of Chi for Self-Defense and Energy Healing | publisher = Blue Snake Books/Frog, Ltd. | location =  | isbn = 978-1-58394-134-8 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another example, the healing form Eight Pieces of Brocade ([[Baduanjin qigong]]) is based on a series of static postures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Yang | first1 = Jwing-Ming | last2 = Jwing-Ming | first2 = Yang | title = Eight Simple Qigong Exercises for Health: The Eight Pieces of Brocade | publisher = YMAA Publication Center | location =2007  | isbn = 978-1-886969-52-0 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Meditative practice
: utilizes breath awareness, visualization, [[mantra]], chanting, sound, and focus on philosophical concepts such as qi circulation, aesthetics, or moral values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Lu|first=Kuan Yü| year=1969|title= The secrets of Chinese meditation: self-cultivation by mind control as taught in the Ch'an, Mahāyāna and Taoist schools in China|publisher= S. Weiser|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional Chinese medicine and Daoist practice, the meditative focus is commonly on cultivating qi in [[dantian]] energy centers and balancing qi flow in [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridian]] and other pathways.  In various Buddhist traditions, the aim is to still the mind, either through outward focus, for example on a place, or through inward focus on the breath, a mantra, a [[koan]], emptiness, or the idea of the eternal. In the Confucius scholar tradition, meditation is focused on humanity and virtue, with the aim of self-enlightenment.&lt;ref name=YJM2 /&gt;

* Use of external agents
: Many systems of qigong practice include the use of external agents such as ingestion of herbs, massage, physical manipulation, or interaction with other living organisms.&lt;ref name=LWW/&gt;  For example, specialized food and drinks are used in some medical and Daoist forms, whereas massage and body manipulation are sometimes used in martial arts forms.

There are numerous qigong forms. 75 ancient forms that can be found in ancient literature and also 56 common or contemporary forms have been described in a qigong compendium.&lt;ref name="MaJiRen1992"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Ma Ji Ren 馬濟人| title = Practical Qigong for Traditional Chinese Medicine 實用中醫氣功學 | year = 1992 | publisher = Shanghai Scientific and Technical Publishers 上海科学枝术出版社| location =  | isbn = 7532327205| pages = 466}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|203–433}} The list is by no means exhaustive. Many contemporary forms were developed by people who had recovered from their illness after qigong practice.

===Techniques===

Whether viewed from the perspective of exercise, health, philosophy, or martial arts training, several main principles emerge concerning the practice of qigong:&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Frantzis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garripoli&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Garripoli | first1 = Garri | title = Qigong: Essence of the Healing Dance | year =1999 | publisher = HCI | location =  | isbn = 1-55874-674-9 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Jeff|title=Use of Sound in Qigong|url=http://portlandtaichiacademy.com/the-use-of-sound-in-qigong/|work=portlandtaichiacademy.com|publisher=Portland Tai Chi Academy|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Intentional movement''': careful, flowing balanced style
* '''Rhythmic breathing''': slow, deep, coordinated with fluid movement
* '''Awareness''': calm, focused meditative state
* '''Visualization''': of qi flow, philosophical tenets, aesthetics
* '''Chanting/Sound''': use of sound as a focal point

Additional principles:

* '''Softness''': soft gaze, expressionless face
* '''Solid Stance''': firm footing, erect spine
* '''Relaxation''': relaxed muscles, slightly bent joints
* '''Balance and Counterbalance''': motion over the center of gravity

Advanced goals:

* '''Equanimity''': more fluid, more relaxed
* '''Tranquility''': empty mind, high awareness
* '''Stillness''': smaller and smaller movements, eventually to complete stillness

The most advanced practice is generally considered to be with little or no motion.

==Traditional and classical theory==
{{main|Qi}}
[[File:BRASILRIO4.jpg|thumb|right|Qigong practitioners in [[Brazil]]]]
Over time, five distinct traditions or schools of qigong developed in China, each with its own theories and characteristics: Chinese Medical Qigong, Daoist Qigong, Buddhist Qigong, Confucian Qigong, and martial arts qigong.&lt;ref name=Liu2013CMQ/&gt;{{rp|30–80}} All of these qigong traditions include practices intended to cultivate and balance [[qi]].&lt;ref name=YJM2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Frantzis | first1 = Bruce Kumar | title = Opening the Energy Gates of Your Body (The Tao of Energy Enhancement) | year =1995 | publisher = North Atlantic Books | location =  | isbn = 978-1-55643-164-7 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Liu | first1 = JeeLoo | title = An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy: From Ancient Philosophy to Chinese Buddhism | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location =  | isbn = 978-1-4051-2949-7 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Li | first1 = Chenyang | title = The Tao encounters the West: explorations in comparative philosophy | year = 1999 | publisher = State University of New York Press | location = Albany  | isbn = 978-0-7914-4135-0 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional Chinese medicine===
{{main|Traditional Chinese medicine}}
The theories of ancient Chinese qigong include the [[Yin-Yang]] and [[Wu Xing|Five Phases]] Theory, [[Jing (Chinese medicine)|Essence]]-[[Qi]]-[[Shen (Chinese religion)|Spirit]] Theory, Zang-Xiang Theory, and Meridians and Qi-Blood Theory, which have been synthesized as part of [[traditional Chinese medicine|Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)]].&lt;ref name=Liu2013CMQ/&gt;{{rp|45–57}} TCM focuses on tracing and correcting underlying disharmony, in terms of deficiency and excess, using the complementary and opposing forces of [[yin and yang|yin and yang (陰陽)]], to create a balanced flow of qi.  Qi is believed to be cultivated and stored in three main [[dantian]] energy centers and to travel through the body along twelve main [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians (Jīng Luò 經絡)]], with numerous smaller branches and tributaries.  The main meridians correspond to [[Zang Fu|twelve main organs (Zàng fǔ 臟腑))]].  Qi is balanced in terms of [[yin and yang]] in the context of the traditional system of [[Wu Xing|Five Phases (Wu xing 五行)]].&lt;ref name=YJM2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holland /&gt; A person is believed to become ill or die when qi becomes diminished or unbalanced.  Health is believed to be returned by rebuilding qi, eliminating qi blockages, and correcting qi imbalances.  These TCM concepts do not translate readily to modern science and medicine.

===Daoism===
In [[Taoism|Daoism]] various practices now known as Daoist Qigong are claimed to provide a way to achieve [[longevity]] and spiritual [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Luk | first1 = C. | last2 = Chen Chao | first2 = Pi | last3 = Lu | first3 = Kʻuan Yü | title = Taoist yoga: alchemy and immortality: a translation, with introduction and notes, of The secrets of cultivating nature and eternal life (Hsin ming fa chueh ming chih) | year = 1984 | publisher = Samuel Weiser | location = York Beach, Me.  | isbn = 978-0-87728-067-5 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a closer connection with the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Réquéna | first1 = Yves | title = Chi Kung: The Chinese Art of Mastering Energy | year = 1996 | publisher = Healing Arts Press | location =   | isbn = 978-0892816392 | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
In [[Buddhism in China|Buddhism]] meditative practices now known as Buddhist Qigong are part of a spiritual path that leads to [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|spiritual enlightenment]] or [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Bucknell | first1 = Roderick S. | last2 = Stuart-Fox | first2 = Martin | title = The twilight language: explorations in Buddhist meditation and symbolism | year = 1993 | publisher = Curzon Press | location = London  | isbn = 978-0-7007-0234-3 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confucianism===
In [[Confusianism|Confucianism]] practices now known as Confucian Qigong provide a means to become a [[Junzi]] (君子) through awareness of [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Contemporary qigong==

In contemporary China, the emphasis of qigong practice has shifted away from traditional philosophy, spiritual attainment, and folklore, and increasingly to health benefits, traditional medicine and martial arts applications, and a scientific perspective.&lt;ref name = Palmer /&gt;&lt;ref name = Ownby /&gt; Qigong is now practiced by millions worldwide, primarily for its health benefits, though many practitioners have also adopted traditional [[Chinese philosophy|philosophical]], [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medical]], or [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]] perspectives, and even use the long [[Qigong history|history of qigong]] as evidence of its effectiveness.&lt;ref name="YJM2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garripoli /&gt;

===Contemporary Chinese medical qigong===
Qigong has been recognized as a "standard medical technique" in China since 1989, and is sometimes included in the medical curriculum of major universities in China.&lt;ref name=Wengell2008&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNR1KGJXX9cC&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Educational Opportunities in Integrative Medicine |author1=Douglas Wengell |author2=Nathen Gabriel |publisher=The Hunter Press |isbn=978-0-9776552-4-3 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}} The 2013 English translation of the official Chinese Medical Qigong textbook used in China&lt;ref name=Liu2013CMQ/&gt;{{rp|iv,385}} defines CMQ as "the skill of body-mind exercise that integrates body, breath, and mind adjustments into one" and emphasizes that qigong is based on "adjustment" (tiao 調, also translated as “regulation”, “tuning”, or “alignment.”) of body, breath, and mind.&lt;ref name=Liu2013CMQ&gt;{{cite book|editor-last= Liu |editor-first=Tian Jun|editor-last2= Qiang |editor-first2=Xiao Mei | year=2013|title= Chinese Medical Qigong, Third Edition|publisher= Singing Dragon |isbn=978-1848190962}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16–18}}  As such, qigong is viewed by practitioners as being more than common physical exercise, because qigong combines postural, breathing, and mental training in one to produce a particular psychophysiological state of being.&lt;ref name=Liu2013CMQ/&gt;{{rp|15}}  While CMQ is still based on traditional and classical theory, modern practitioners also emphasize the importance of a strong scientific basis.&lt;ref name=Liu2013CMQ/&gt;{{rp|81–89}}  According to the 2013 CMQ textbook, physiological effects of qigong are numerous, and include improvement of respiratory and cardiovascular function, and possibly neurophysiological function.&lt;ref name=Liu2013CMQ/&gt;{{rp|89–102}}

===Conventional medicine===
Conventional or mainstream medicine includes specific practices and techniques based on the [[Evidence-based medicine|best available evidence]] demonstrating effectiveness and safety.&lt;ref name=Sackett96&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sackett DL, Rosenberg WM, Gray JA, Haynes RB, Richardson WS |title=Evidence based medicine: what it is and what it isn't |journal=BMJ |volume=312 |issue=7023 |pages=71–2 |date=January 1996 |pmid=8555924 |pmc=2349778  |doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7023.71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qigong is not generally considered to be part of mainstream medicine, because clinical research concerning effectiveness of qigong for specific medical conditions is not supported by Western medicine at this stage, and so, at present, there is no medical interest, or consensus concerning the effectiveness, or even the reality of Qigong.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Integrative, complementary, and alternative medicine===
Integrative medicine (IM) refers to "the blending of conventional and complementary medicines and therapies with the aim of using the most appropriate of either or both modalities to care for the patient as a whole",&lt;ref name=Kotsirilos2011&gt;{{cite book|author=Kotsirilos, Vicki, Luis Vitetta, and Avni Sali| year=2011|title=A Guide to Evidence-based Integrative and Complementary Medicine |publisher= Elsevier Health Sciences APAC. Kindle Edition.|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|455–456}} whereas complementary generally refers to "using a non-mainstream approach together with conventional medicine", and alternative refers to "using a non-mainstream approach in place of conventional medicine".&lt;ref name=NIHNCCAM2013&gt;{{cite web|date=2018|title=Complementary, Alternative, or Integrative Health: What’s In a Name?|publisher= National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, US National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qigong is used by integrative medicine practitioners to complement conventional medical treatment, based on complementary and alternative medicine interpretations of the effectiveness and safety of qigong.&lt;ref name=nccih2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Micozzi2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Micozzi, Marc S.| year=2010|title=Fundamentals of Complementary and Alternative Medicine|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences, Kindle Edition|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22278–22306}}

===Scientific basis===
Scientists interested in qigong have sought to describe or verify the effects of qigong, to explore mechanisms of effects, to form scientific theory with respect to Qigong, and to identify appropriate research methodology for further study.&lt;ref name=Liu2013CMQ/&gt;{{rp|81–89}}  In terms of traditional theory, the existence of qi has not been independently verified in an experimental setting.&lt;ref name=NCCAM&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Medicine: An Overview|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115162836/http://nccam.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/energymed.htm|publisher=National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine|archivedate=15 November 2008|accessdate=17 March 2014|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/energymed.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health applications ==

=== Recreation and popular use ===
People practice qigong for many different reasons, including for [[recreation]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]] and [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]], [[preventive medicine]] and [[self-healing]], [[meditation]] and [[Higher self|self-cultivation]], and [[Chinese martial arts|training for martial arts]]. Practitioners range from athletes to the physically challenged. Because it is low impact and can be done lying, sitting, or standing, qigong is accessible for disabled persons, seniors, and people recovering from injuries.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

=== Therapeutic use ===
Therapeutic use of qigong is directed by TCM, CAM, integrative medicine, and other health practitioners.&lt;ref name=nccih2016/&gt;  In China, where it is considered a "standard medical technique",&lt;ref name=Wengell2008/&gt;{{rp|34}} qigong is commonly prescribed to treat a wide variety of conditions, and clinical applications include [[hypertension]], [[coronary artery disease]], [[peptic ulcers]], [[liver diseases|chronic liver diseases]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[obesity]], [[menopause|menopause syndrome]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[insomnia]], [[Cancer|tumors and cancer]], [[lower back pain|lower back and leg pain]], [[cervical spondylosis]], and [[myopia]].&lt;ref name=Liu2013CMQ/&gt;{{rp|261–391}}  Outside China qigong is used in [[integrative medicine]] to complement or supplement accepted medical treatments, including for [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]], [[Physical exercise|fitness]], [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]], and treatment of specific conditions.&lt;ref name=Kotsirilos2011/&gt;&lt;ref name= Kuntsler2010&gt;{{cite book|last1= Kuntsler |first1= R.A. |author2=F.S. Daly  |year=2010 |title= Therapeutic Recreation Leadership and Programming |publisher=Human Kinetics |isbn=978-0736068550 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no high-quality evidence that qigong is actually effective for these conditions.&lt;ref name=hartley/&gt; Based on [[systematic reviews]] of [[clinical research]], it is not possible within current level of available evidence to draw conclusions concerning effectiveness of qigong for specific medical conditions at this stage.&lt;ref name=nccih2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee2011/&gt;

=== Safety and cost ===
Qigong is generally viewed as safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tai Chi and Qi Gong for Health and Well-Being|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/video/taichiDVD|publisher=National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; No adverse effects have been observed in clinical trials, such that qigong is considered safe for use across diverse populations. Cost for self-care is minimal, and cost efficiencies are high for group delivered care.&lt;ref name=Jahnke_et_al_2010/&gt; Typically the cautions associated with qigong are the same as those associated with any physical activity, including risk of muscle strains or sprains, advisability of stretching to prevent injury, general safety for use alongside conventional medical treatments, and consulting with a physician when combining with conventional treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web MD: Are tai chi and qi gong safe?|url=http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/tc/tai-chi-and-qi-gong-topic-overview|accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical research==

=== Overview ===

Although there is ongoing [[clinical research]] examining the potential health effects of qigong, there is little financial or medical incentive to support high-quality research, and still only a limited number of studies meet accepted medical and scientific standards of [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized controlled trials (RCTs)]].&lt;ref name=Jahnke_et_al_2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jahnke | first1 = R. | last2 = Larkey | first2 = L. | last3 = Rogers | first3 = C. |  last4 = Etnier | first4 = J |  last5 = Lin | first5 =  F. | title = A comprehensive review of health benefits of qigong and tai chi | year =2010 | journal = American Journal of Health Promotion | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = e1–e25 | pmid=20594090 | doi=10.4278/ajhp.081013-LIT-248 | pmc=3085832}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clinical research concerning qigong has been conducted for a wide range of medical conditions, including [[bone density]], [[Cardiopulmonary|cardiopulmonary effects]], [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|physical function]], [[Balance (ability)|falls and related risk factors]], [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]], [[Immune system|immune function]], [[inflammation]],&lt;ref name=Jahnke_et_al_2010/&gt; [[hypertension]],&lt;ref name=hartley/&gt; [[pain]],&lt;ref name=LeeIntPain2009/&gt; [[Parkinson's disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moon|first=Sanghee|last2=Schmidt|first2=Marshall|last3=Smirnova|first3=Irina V.|last4=Colgrove|first4=Yvonne|last5=Liu|first5=Wen|date=2017-04-23|title=Qigong Exercise May Reduce Serum TNF-α Levels and Improve Sleep in People with Parkinson’s Disease: A Pilot Study|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2305-6320/4/2/23|journal=Medicines|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=23|doi=10.3390/medicines4020023}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cancer]] treatment.&lt;ref name=LeeCancer2010/&gt;

=== Systematic reviews ===

A 2017 [[systematic review]] concluded that [[Baduanjin qigong]] is beneficial for quality of life, sleep quality, balance, handgrip strength, trunk flexibility, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and resting heart rate; and that reviewed studies are insufficient to confirm benefits for leg power, cardiopulmonary endurance, and pulmonary function.&lt;ref name=Zou2017&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zou L, Sasaki JE, Wang H, Zhongjun X, Qun F, Zhang M|url=https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/4548706|title=A systematic review and meta-analysis of Baduanjin Qigong for health benefits: randomized controlled trials.|journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|date=2017|volume=2017.

A 2011 overview of [[systematic reviews]] of clinical trials concluded that "the effectiveness of qigong is based mostly on poor quality research" and "therefore, it would be unwise to draw firm conclusions at this stage".&lt;ref name=Lee2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee MS, Oh B, Ernst E |title=Qigong for healthcare: an overview of systematic reviews |journal=JRSM Short Rep |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=7 |year=2011 |pmid=21369525 |pmc=3046559 |doi=10.1258/shorts.2010.010091 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although a 2010 [[literature review|comprehensive literature review]] found 77 peer-reviewed [[Randomized controlled trial|RCTs]];&lt;ref name=Jahnke_et_al_2010/&gt; systematic reviews for particular health conditions show that most clinical research is of poor quality, typically because of small sample size and lack of proper control groups, with lack of [[Blind study|blinding]] associated with high risk of bias.&lt;ref name=Lee2011/&gt;

A 2010 systematic review of the effect of qigong exercises on [[cancer]] treatment concluded "the effectiveness of qigong in cancer care is not yet supported by the evidence from rigorous clinical trials."&lt;ref name=LeeCancer2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee MS, Chen KW, Sancier KM, Ernst E |title=Qigong for cancer treatment: a systematic review of controlled clinical trials |journal=Acta Oncol |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=717–22 |year=2007 |pmid=17653892 |doi=10.1080/02841860701261584 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate systematic review that looked at the effects of qigong exercises on various physiological or psychological outcomes found that the available studies were poorly designed, with a high of bias in the results. Therefore, the authors concluded, "Due to limited number of RCTs in the field and methodological problems and high risk of bias in the included studies, it is still too early to reach a conclusion about the efficacy and the effectiveness of qigong exercise as a form of health practice adopted by the cancer patients during their curative, palliative, and rehabilitative phases of the cancer journey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Chan CL, Wang CW, Ho RT, etal |title=A systematic review of the effectiveness of qigong exercise in supportive cancer care |journal=Support Care Cancer |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=1121–33 |date=June 2012 |pmid=22258414 |pmc=3342492 |doi=10.1007/s00520-011-1378-3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 systematic review on the effect of qigong exercises on reducing pain concluded that "the existing trial evidence is not convincing enough to suggest that internal qigong is an effective modality for pain management."&lt;ref name=LeeIntPain2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee MS, Pittler MH, Ernst E |title=Internal qigong for pain conditions: a systematic review |journal=J Pain |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=1121–1127.e14 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19559656 |doi=10.1016/j.jpain.2009.03.009 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental health ===
Many claims have been made that qigong can benefit or ameliorate mental health conditions,&lt;ref name=Jahnke_et_al_2010 /&gt; including improved [[mood (psychology)|mood]], decreased stress reaction, and decreased anxiety and depression.  Most medical studies have only examined psychological factors as secondary goals, although various studies have shown decreases in [[cortisol]] levels, a chemical hormone produced by the body in response to stress.&lt;ref name=Jahnke_et_al_2010 /&gt;

===China===
Basic and clinical research in China during the 1980s was mostly descriptive, and few results were reported in [[peer-review]]ed English-language journals.&lt;ref name=Micozzi2010/&gt;{{rp|,22060–22063}} Qigong became known outside China in the 1990s, and clinical randomized controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of qigong on health and mental conditions began to be published worldwide, along with systematic reviews.&lt;ref name=Micozzi2010/&gt;{{rp|21792–21798}}

=== Challenges===
Most existing clinical trials have small sample sizes and many have inadequate controls. Of particular concern is the impracticality of [[Blinded experiment|double blinding]] using appropriate sham treatments, and the difficulty of placebo control, such that benefits often cannot be distinguished from the [[placebo effect]].&lt;ref name=Micozzi2010/&gt;{{rp|22278–22306}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Clinical trials and CAM |url=https://nccih.nih.gov/sites/nccam.nih.gov/files/clinicaltrials.pdf |publisher=National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, US National Institutes of Health |accessdate=27 October 2018 |date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also of concern is the choice of which qigong form to use and how to standardize the treatment or amount with respect to the skill of the practitioner leading or administering treatment, the tradition of individualization of treatments, and the treatment length, intensity, and frequency.&lt;ref name=Micozzi2010/&gt;{{rp|6869–6920,22361–22370}}

==Meditation and self-cultivation applications==
{{main|Meditation}}
Qigong is practiced for [[meditation]] and self-cultivation as part of various philosophical and spiritual traditions. As meditation, qigong is a means to still the mind and enter a state of consciousness that brings serenity, clarity, and bliss.&lt;ref name=LWW /&gt;  Many practitioners find qigong, with its gentle focused movement, to be more accessible than seated meditation.&lt;ref name="Garripoli"/&gt;

Qigong for self-cultivation can be classified in terms of traditional Chinese philosophy: Daoist, Buddhist, and Confucian.

==Martial arts applications==
The practice of qigong is an important component in both [[Neijia|internal]] and external style [[Chinese martial arts]].&lt;ref name =LWW /&gt; Focus on qi is considered to be a source of power as well as the foundation of the [[Neijia|internal style]] of martial arts (Neijia). [[T'ai Chi Ch'uan]], [[Xing Yi Quan]], and [[Baguazhang]] are representative of the types of Chinese martial arts that rely on the concept of qi as the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Li | first1 = Lu | last2 = Yun | first2 = Zhang | title = The Combat Techniques of Tai Ji, Xing Yi, and Ba Gua : Principles and Practices of Internal Martial Arts | year =2006  | publisher = Frog, Ltd./Blue Snake Books | location =  | isbn = 978-1-58394-145-4 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extraordinary feats of martial arts prowess, such as the ability to withstand heavy strikes ([[Iron Shirt]], 鐵衫)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Chia | first1 = Mantak | title = Iron Shirt Chi Kung | year =2006  | publisher = Destiny Books | location =  | isbn = 978-1-59477-104-0 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ability to break hard objects ([[Iron Palm]], 鐵掌)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Lee | first1 = Ying-Arng. | title = Iron Palm in 100 days | year =1973  | publisher = Wehman Bros.

=== T'ai Chi Ch'uan and Qigong ===
{{Main|T'ai Chi Ch'uan}}
''[[T'ai Chi Ch'uan]]'' (Taijiquan) is a widely practiced Chinese [[Neijia|internal]] [[Chinese martial arts|martial style]] based on the theory of [[Taiji (philosophy)|taiji]] ("grand ultimate"), closely associated with qigong, and typically involving more complex choreographed movement coordinated with breath, done slowly for health and training, or quickly for self-defense. Many scholars consider t'ai chi ch'uan to be a type of qigong, traced back to an origin in the seventeenth century. In modern practice, qigong typically focuses more on health and meditation rather than martial applications, and plays an important role in training for t'ai chi ch'uan, in particular used to build strength, develop breath control, and increase vitality ("life energy").&lt;ref name = yang_taiji/&gt;&lt;ref name = yeyoung_taichi_qigong&gt;{{cite web | last = YeYoung |first = Bing | title = Introduction to Taichi and Qigong | publisher = [http://literati-tradition.com YeYoung Culture Studies: Sacramento, CA] | url = http://sactaichi.com/what-is-qi-gong | accessdate =2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Erasmusprijs 1966, uitreiking in Ridderzaal te Den Haag prins reikt prijs uit aa, Bestanddeelnr 919-2923.jpg|thumb|Huyghe ([[Erasmus Prize]], 1966)]]
'''René Huyghe''' (3 May 1906, [[Arras]] – 5 February 1997, [[Paris]]) was a French writer on the history, [[Psychology of art|psychology]] and [[Aesthetics|philosophy]] of art. He was also a curator at the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]]'s department of paintings (from 1930), a professor at the [[Collège de France]] and from 1960 a member of the [[Académie française]]. He was the father of the writer [[François-Bernard Huyghe]].

==Biography==
René Huyghe studied philosophy and aesthetics at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and the [[école du Louvre]]. Made a curator of the Louvre's department of paintings in 1930, he rose to chief curator and professor of the école du Louvre in 1936, aged only 30. He founded and edited the reviews ''L’Amour de l’Art'' and ''Quadrige''. He was one of the first figures in France to make films on art, such as his ''[[Rubens]]'' (winner of a prize at the [[Venice Biennale]]), and founded the International Federation of Films on Art.

During the [[Second World War]] Huyghe organised the evacuation of the Louvre's paintings into the [[Vichy France|unoccupied zone]] and took charge of their protection until the [[Liberation of France]]. In 1950, he was elected to the [[Collège de France]], occupying the chair of psychology of the [[plastic arts]]. In 1966, he won the [[Erasmus Prize]] at [[The Hague]].

In 1974, Huyghe was made director of the [[Musée Jacquemart-André]]. It was at this time that he first met the Japanese philosopher [[Daisaku Ikeda]] with whom he published a dialogue titled ''Dawn After Dark''. The book was re-released in 2007 by the London-based publishing house [[I.B. Tauris]].

As he was the creator of many TV shows about art abroad, he failed to realize his TV projects, always refused by French TV officials. With the victory of the socialist candidate at the Presidential election in May 1981, he was « persona non grata » on French TV.&lt;ref&gt;« La chronique de [[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]] : M. l'académicien a des ennuis », ''[[Le Quotidien de Paris]]'', 20 May 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huyghe was president of [[UNESCO]]'s international committee of experts for saving [[Venice]] and served on the Conseil artistique des Musées de France.

[[File:Chiaramonti - Opuscula varia mathematica, 1653 - 830104.jpg|thumb|''Opuscula varia mathematica'', 1653]]

'''Scipione Chiaramonti''' (21 June 1565, [[Cesena]] – 3 October 1652, Cesena) was an Italian philosopher and noted opponent of [[Galileo]].&lt;ref name="Treccani" /&gt;

== Early life ==
The Chiaramonti family was noble and wealthy, claiming to have originated in Clermont and moved to Italy in the fourteenth century. [[Pope Pius VII]] (1742–1823) was from the same family.&lt;ref name="Treccani"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Benzoni |first1=Gino |title=Chiaramonti Scipione |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/scipione-chiaramonti_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/ |website=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani |publisher=Treccani |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The son of a doctor, Scipione studied at the University of Ferrara, lodging first at the house of Cardinal Alessandro d’Este and later associating with the circle of Cardinal Curzio Sangiorgi.&lt;ref name="Museo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Scipione Chiaramonti |url=https://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/itineraries/biography/ScipioneChiaramonti.html |website=brunelleschi.imss.it |publisher=Museo Galileo |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1588 he married Virginia Abbati, with whom he was to father twelve children (including at least seven boys). In 1592 he met Galileo, passing through Cesena on his way to [[Pesaro]], who described him as 'very gifted in mathematics'; the same year he graduated in philosophy.&lt;ref name="Treccani" /&gt;

He spent a short period in [[Faenza]] where, in 1598 he wrote a treatise on mathematical problems in artillery; in 1601, he was hired, at annual salary of 340 scudi, as "interpreter of natural philosophy to the academy of [[Perugia]]" and also received an annual allowance of 400 ducats from Cardinal Alessandro d'Este. He was highly regarded by the Cardinal's half-brother, [[Cesare d'Este, Duke of Modena]] whom he served as mathematician and advisor, and who took two of his sons, Virginio and Niccolò, as his pages. He was for a time also in the service of Cardinal [[Cinzio Passeri Aldobrandini]].  Some time between 1610 and 1614 he composed a treatise on stage scenery.&lt;ref name="Treccani" /&gt;

== Opposition to Tycho Brahe ==
In 1618 three comets appeared over Europe, and Chiaromonti dedicated his first printed work, ''Discorso della cometa pogonare dell'anno MDCXVIII'' to Cesare d'Este. He thus entered into a scientific polemic on the nature of comets that involved [[Orazio Grassi]] and Galileo; while Galileo held that they were most likely optical illusions rather than heavenly bodies, Chiaramonti argued that comets were made of 'elemental substance', did display [[parallax]] and were definitely sublunar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miguel A. Granada|author2=Adam Mosley|author3=Nicholas Jardine|title=Christoph Rothmann's Discourse on the Comet of 1585: An Edition and Translation with Accompanying Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUv3AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA338|date=2014-06-06|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-26035-1|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as Galileo sought to interpret the phenomenon of comets in a way which supported [[Copernican heliocentrism]], Chiaramonti explained it with the intention of supporting the traditional [[geocentric model]].  Chiaramonti was such a determined defender of classical astronomy that he rejected even the [[Tychonic system]], which was by then commonly accepted among Jesuit scholars and other astronomers who did not accept the views of Copernicus.&lt;ref name="Treccani" /&gt; Chiaramonti's second and more significant venture into this scholarly field came with his 1621 work ''Antitycho'' which opposed the argument of [[Tycho Brahe]] that comets were celestial bodies following an orbit above the moon.  In this work Chiaramonti tackled not only Tycho but Grassi, devoting 10 of the work's 65 chapters to refuting his arguments about comets.&lt;ref name="Treccani" /&gt; When [[Johannes Kepler]] received a copy of ''Antitycho'', he replied with ''Shieldbearer for Tycho''.&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Rosen|title=Kepler's Somnium: The Dream, Or Posthumous Work on Lunar Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdCJAS0eQ64C&amp;pg=PA150|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-43282-3|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fundamental difference of views with Chiaramonti, Galileo maintained cordial relations with him at this time, referring to him positively in ''[[The Assayer]]'' as having conclusively proved the falsity of Tycho's model of the universe. Galileo's views may have hardened after Chiaramonti replied to Kepler's ''Shieldbearer'' in 1626 with his ''Apologia pro Antitychone''. In this he reiterated what [[Benedetto Castelli]] described as "ridiculous and impossible" opinions on comets and stars. [[Mario Guiducci]] scorned him as a "cold, insipid Perpiatetic" who needed "a good ironing."&lt;ref name="Treccani" /&gt;

In contrast, Chiaramonti's standing in Church circles continued to rise, and he served as a consultant to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]] in Cesena. Many conservative churchmen in Rome were convinced that they had found in him the champion who would overcome dangerous innovations and restore traditional certainties. As Guiducci reported to Galileo, some believed that Chiaramonti would prove able to resolve the question of the earth's movement in favour of [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]]. The poet Pier Francesco Minozzi praised him in verse as ‘the Aristotle of our times.’&lt;ref name="Treccani" /&gt;

== 'Enemy of Astronomers' ==
In 1627 Chiaramonti was elected to the chair in philosophy at the [[University of Pisa]] with an annual salary of 700 ducats,&lt;ref name="Treccani" /&gt; where he remained until 1636.&lt;ref name="Museo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Franco Gabici|author2=Fabio Toscano|title=Scienziati di Romagna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-sep9pBb_AC&amp;pg=PA319|year=2006|publisher=Alpha Test|isbn=978-88-518-0080-2|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1629 he applied to the more prestigious [[university of Bologna]] to teach mathematics, but his appointment was blocked, with particularly strong opposition from Galileo's friend [[Cesare Marsili]], who described him as "such an enemy of astronomers" ("tanto nemico degli astronomi"). In 1628 Chiaramonti published another attack on both Tycho and Copernicus, ''De Tribus Novis Stellis''.  This was concerned with three transient 'new stars' in [[SN 1572|1572]], 1600 and [[Kepler's Supernova|1604]].   His purpose was to refute arguments that these were actual stars rather than sublunary events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Criticism of Scipione Chiaramonti's "De tribus novis stellis" |url=https://www.library.ethz.ch/en/ms/Virtual-exhibitions/Galileo-Galilei/The-Dialogue/Criticism-of-Scipione-Chiaramonti-s-De-tribus-novis-stellis |website=ETH Zurich |publisher=ETH |accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=L. E. Maistrov|title=Probability Theory: A Historical Sketch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZbiBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|date=2014-07-03|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-1-4832-1863-2|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of Galileo's ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'' in Italian in 1632 and then in Latin in 1635, dealt a serious blow to Chiaramonti's scientific credibility.  In the dialogue, arguments that he had used in past were placed in the mouth of Galileo's idiot character Simplicius in such way that, as Chiaramonti himself commented, only a "scempio" ("disgrace", "total mess") like Simplicio could possibly believe them. The character of Salivati firmly rebuts these points, dismissing "Antitycho" as a work hardly meriting serious attention, and referring to existence of sunspots, which not only darken the surface of the sun, but cast a shadow on the whole of peripatetic philosophy.&lt;ref name="Treccani" /&gt; Chiaramonti is explicitly named in the "Dialogue", and Salviati says that as he is not present to answer his questions, he invites Simplicio to respond in his place. Simplicio does so, quoting verbatim from Chiaramonti's ''De Tribus Novis Stellis''.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite book|author=Crystal Hall|title=Galileo's Reading|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RLrAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164|date=2013-12-12|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-04755-6|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiaramonti responded to Galileo almost at once with a dialogue of his own, the ''Difesa di Scipione Chiaramonti da Cesena al suo Antiticone'' (1633).  In this he argued a position that "is neither well presented [i.e. by Salviati to Simplicio].... nor is it answered by him." Chiaramonti rewrote this entire section of Galileo's ''Dialogue'', challenging Galileo's logic and inserting responses in the Salviati-Simplicio conversation to indicate what he would have said in place of Simplicio's weak replies.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; Galileo's supporters were scathing about this book, but Galileo was unable to respond to it publicly.  In October 1632 he had been summoned to Rome for questioning by the Inquisition following the publication of his "Dialogue" and in April 1633 his trial began.  One of his judges was [[Francesco Barberini (1597–1679)|Cardinal Francesco Barberini]], nephew of the Pope, and Grand Inquisitor, to whom Chiaramonti had dedicated his ''Difesa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey L.

== Later disputes ==
In 1635 Chiaramonti published a work of political philosophy, ''Della Ragion di Stato'' which examined at great length different possible definitions of the terms 'reason' and 'state' and considered the dilemmas of statecraft and morality.  The following year he left his position at Pisa, was unsuccessful in soliciting a chair at the [[University of Padua]] (which he wanted to secure without competition and with a salary of more than 600 sequins), and retired to Cesena. Here he devoted much of his time to an 887-page history of his native city, ''Caesenae historia'', which was published in 1641.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Caesenae historia authore Scipione Claramontio ab initio civitatis ad haec tempora .... |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Caesenae_historia_authore_Scipione_Clara.html?id=wxSenQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |website=Google books |publisher=Google |accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Treccani" /&gt;

The remainder of his attention returned to the territory of scholarly disputes; [[:it:Giovanni Camillo Glorioso]] had criticised his ''De Tribus'' and in 1636 Charamonti published a refutation, ''Examen censurae Gloriosi'', to which Glorioso replied the following year ''Castigatio examinis''. To this Chiaramonti responded in turn with ''Castigatio Ioannis Camilli Gloriosi aduersus Scipionem Claramontium Caesenatem'' (1638). Glorioso's final contribution to this dispute was his ''Responsio'' (1641).  As he died soon after, this allowed Chiaramonti the last word, which he took with a volume of more than 500 pages, summarising his Aristotelian positions on a wide range of topics, his ''Opus Scipionis Claramontis Caesenatis de Universo'' (1644).&lt;ref name="Treccani" /&gt; No less acrimonious was his dispute with Galileo's friend [[Fortunio Liceti]], founded on the same wish to defend Aristotle against any modern observation or experiment.  This polemic was opened by Chiaramonti in 1636 and was fought by exchange of pamphlets until 1648. While pursuing these extended arguments, Chiaramonti produced a number of systematic treatises which reaffirmed classical Aristotelian thinking, and in 1643, the year after Galileo's death, he published an attack on his views in ''Antiphilolaus''.&lt;ref name="Treccani" /&gt;

== Later life ==
Chiaramonti's wife died in 1644; there is an account that at the age of eighty he remarried to a much younger wife, but the consensus is that soon after he widowed, he joined the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] order to which four of his sons already belonged, and erected at his own expense a church dedicated to Saint Philip and Saint Cecilia.  He died in Cesena on 3 October 1652.&lt;ref name="Treccani" /&gt;

'''Self-actualization''' is a term that has been used in various [[psychology]] theories, often in different ways. The term was originally introduced by the [[Organismic theory|organismic theorist]] [[Kurt Goldstein]] for the motive to realize one's full potential. Expressing one's [[creativity]], quest  [[spiritual enlightenment]], pursuit of [[knowledge]], and the desire to give to and/or positively transform society are examples of self-actualization. In Goldstein's view, it is the organism's master motive, the only real motive: "the tendency to actualize itself as fully as possible is the basic drive... the drive of self-actualization."&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, quoted in Arnold H. Modell, ''The Private Self'' (Harvard 1993) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Rogers]] similarly wrote of "the curative force in psychotherapy – ''man's tendency to actualize himself, to become his potentialities''... to express and activate all the capacities of the organism."&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rogers, ''On Becoming a Person'' (1961) p. 350-1&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was brought most fully to prominence in [[Abraham Maslow]]'s [[hierarchy of needs]] theory as the final level of psychological development that can be achieved when all basic and mental needs are essentially fulfilled and the "actualization" of the full personal potential takes place,&lt;ref&gt;Abraham H. Maslow, Motivation and Personality. 2nd ed., Chapter 11 "Self-Actualizing People: A Study of Psychological Health"&lt;/ref&gt; although he adapted this viewpoint later on in life, and saw it more flexibly.&lt;ref name = Koltko&gt;Koltko-Rivera, Mark. E. Rediscovering the Later Version of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs: Self-Transcendence and Opportunities for Theory, Research, and Unification, in: Review of General Psychology, 2006, Vol. 10, No. 4, 302–317&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-actualization can be seen as similar to words and concepts such as self-discovery, [[self-reflection]], [[self-realization]] and self-exploration.

As Abraham Maslow noted, the basic needs of humans must be met (e.g. food, shelter, warmth, security, sense of belonging) before a person can achieve self-actualization – the need to be good, to be fully alive and to find meaning in life. Yet, Maslow argued that reaching a state of true self-actualization in everyday society was fairly rare. Research shows that when people live lives that are different from their true nature and capabilities, they are less likely to be happy than those whose goals and lives match. For example, someone who has inherent potential to be a great artist or teacher may never realize his/her talents if their energy is focused on attaining the basic needs of humans.&lt;ref name="Schacter, Daniel L. 2011"&gt;Schacter, Daniel L., Gilbert, Daniel T., and Wegner, Daniel M. "Human Needs and Self-Actualization". Psychology; Second Edition. New York: Worth, Incorporated, 2011. 486-487. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Goldstein's theory ==

Kurt Goldstein's book ''[[The Organism: A Holistic Approach to Biology Derived from Pathological Data in Man]]'' (1939), presented self-actualization as "the tendency to actualize, as much as possible, [the organism's] individual capacities" in the world.  The tendency toward self-actualization is "the only drive by which the life of an organism is determined".&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Kurt. ''The Organism: A Holistic Approach to Biology Derived from Pathological Data in Man.'' 1934. New York: Zone Books, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; However, for Goldstein self-actualization cannot be understood as a kind of goal to be reached sometime in the future. At any moment the organism has the fundamental tendency to actualize all its capacities, its whole potential, as it is present in exactly that moment, and in exactly that situation in contact with the world under the given circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, M.: (1971): Selected Papers/Ausgewählte Schriften, The Hague (Nijhoff), p. 471&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of Goldstein, Abraham Maslow developed a hierarchical theory of human motivation in ''Motivation and Personality'' (1954).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M. ''Journal of Humanistic Psychology.'' 1990. Santa Cruz: Sage Publications, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maslow's hierarchy of needs ==
{{See also|Maslow's hierarchy of needs}}

Abraham Maslow's book ''Motivation and Personality'' started a philosophical revolution out of which grew humanistic psychology. This changed the view of human nature from a negative point of view – man is a conditioned or tension reducing organism- to a more positive view in which man is motivated to realize his full potential. This is reflected in his hierarchy of needs and in his theory of Self-actualization.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The term was later used by [[Abraham Maslow]] in his article, "A Theory of Human Motivation". Maslow explicitly defines self-actualization to be "the desire for self-fulfillment, namely the tendency for him [the individual] to become actualized in what he is potentially. This tendency might be phrased as the desire to become more and more what one is, to become everything that one is capable of becoming."&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, 2000 [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Maslow/motivation.htm A Theory of Human Motivation]&lt;/ref&gt; Maslow used the term self-actualization to describe a desire, not a driving force, that could lead to realizing one's capabilities. Maslow did not feel that self-actualization determined one's life; rather, he felt that it gave the individual a desire, or motivation to achieve budding ambitions.&lt;ref name="Gleitman and Reisberg"&gt;Gleitman, Henry; Fridlund, Alan J. and Reisberg Daniel. ''Psychology.'' 6th ed. New York: Norton &amp; Company, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Maslow's usage of the term is now popular in modern psychology when discussing personality from the humanistic approach.

A basic definition from a typical college textbook defines self-actualization according to Maslow simply as "the full realization of one's potential", and of one's "true self".&lt;ref name="Gleitman and Reisberg"/&gt;

A more explicit definition of self-actualization according to Maslow is "intrinsic growth of what is already in the organism, or more accurately of what is the organism itself...self-actualization is growth-motivated rather than deficiency-motivated."&lt;ref&gt;Maslow 1987&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation emphasizes the fact that self-actualization cannot normally be reached until other lower order necessities of Maslow's hierarchy of needs are satisfied. While Goldstein defined self-actualization as a driving force, Maslow uses the term to describe personal growth that takes place once lower order needs have essentially been met, one corollary being that, in his opinion, "self-actualisation...rarely happens...certainly in less than 1% of the adult population."&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Maslow, ''Towards a Psychology of Being'' (New York 1968) p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that "most of us function most of the time on a level lower than that of self-actualization" he called the ''psychopathology of normality''.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Loevinger, ''Ego Development'' (California 1976) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Maslow considered self-actualizing people to possess "an unusual ability to detect the spurious, the fake, and the dishonest in personality, and in general to judge people correctly and efficiently."&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, ''Motivation'' (1954) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Maslow based his theory partially on his own assumptions or convictions about human potential and partially on his case studies of historical figures whom he believed to be self-actualized, including Albert Einstein and Henry David Thoreau. Maslow examined the lives of each of these people in order to assess the common qualities that led each to become self-actualized. In general he found that these individuals were very accepting of themselves and of their life circumstances; were focused on finding solutions to cultural problems rather than to personal problems; were open to others' opinions and ideas; had strong senses of privacy, autonomy, human values and appreciation of life; and a few intimate friendships rather than many superficial ones. He also believed that each of these people had somehow managed to find their core-nature that is unique to them, and is one of the true goals of life.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, Arthur S. The Penguin Dictionary of Psychology. 2nd ed. London: Penguin, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maslow's characteristics of self-actualizers ==

A ''self-actualizer'' is a person who is living creatively and fully using his or her potentials. ''What a man can do, he must do.'' It refers to the desire for self-fulfillment, namely, to the tendency for him to become actualized in what he is potentially. While the theory is generally portrayed as a fairly rigid hierarchy, Maslow noted that the order in which these needs are fulfilled does not always follow this standard progression. For example, he notes that for some individuals, the need for self-esteem is more important than the need for love. For others, the need for creative fulfillment may supersede even the most basic needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=What Is Self-Actualization?|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/theoriesofpersonality/a/hierarchyneeds_2.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his studies, Maslow found that self-actualizers share similarities. Whether famous or unknown, educated or not, rich or poor, self-actualizers tend to fit the following profile.&lt;ref&gt;Coon, Mitterer;"An Introduction to Psychology: Gateways to Mind and Behavior" 2007 p. 479&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maslow's self-actualizing characteristics'''

* ''Efficient perceptions of reality.'' Self-actualizers are able to judge situations correctly and honestly. They are very sensitive to the fake and dishonest, and are free to see reality 'as it is'.
* ''Comfortable acceptance of self, others and nature.'' Self-actualizers accept their own human nature with all its flaws. The shortcomings of others and the contradictions of the human condition are accepted with humor and tolerance.
* ''Reliant on own experiences and judgement.'' Independent, not reliant on culture and environment to form opinions and views.
* ''Spontaneous and natural.'' True to oneself, rather than being how others want.
* ''Task centering.'' Most of Maslow's subjects had a mission to fulfill in life or some task or problem 'beyond' themselves (instead of outside themselves) to pursue. Humanitarians such as [[Albert Schweitzer]] are considered to have possessed this quality.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
* ''Autonomy.'' Self-actualizers are free from reliance on external authorities or other people. They tend to be resourceful and independent.
* ''Continued freshness of appreciation.'' The self-actualizer seems to constantly renew appreciation of life's basic goods. A sunset or a flower will be experienced as intensely time after time as it was at first. There is an "innocence of vision", like that of an artist or child.
* ''Profound interpersonal relationships.'' The interpersonal relationships of self-actualizers are marked by deep loving bonds.
* ''Comfort with solitude.'' Despite their satisfying relationships with others, self-actualizing people value solitude and are comfortable being alone.&lt;ref&gt;Sumerlin &amp; Bundrick, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Non-hostile sense of humor.'' This refers to the ability to laugh at oneself.
* ''Peak experiences.'' All of Maslow's subjects reported the frequent occurrence of [[peak experience]]s (temporary moments of self-actualization). These occasions were marked by feelings of ecstasy, harmony, and deep meaning. Self-actualizers reported feeling at one with the universe, stronger and calmer than ever before, filled with light, beauty, goodness, and so forth.
* ''Socially compassionate.'' Possessing humanity.
* ''Few friends.'' Few close intimate friends rather than many superficial relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maslow's Self-Actualizing Characteristics|url=http://www.businessballs.com/maslow.htm|publisher=businessballs.com|accessdate=12/4/13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, self-actualizers feel finally themselves, safe, not anxious, accepted, loved, loving, and alive, certainly living a fulfilling life.

Instead of focusing on what goes wrong with people, Maslow wanted to focus on human potential, and how we fulfill that potential. Maslow (1943, 1954) stated that human motivation is based on people seeking fulfillment and change through personal growth. Self-actualized people as those who were fulfilled and doing all they were capable of. It refers to the person’s desire for self-fulfillment, namely, to the tendency for him to become actualized in what he is potentially. "The specific form that these needs will take will of course vary greatly from person to person. In one individual it may take the form of the desire to be an ideal mother, in another it may be expressed athletically, and in still another it may be expressed in painting pictures or in inventions." &lt;ref&gt;Maslow, 1943, pp. 382–383&lt;/ref&gt;

== In psychology ==

Self-actualization is at the top of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] – becoming '"fully human"...maturity or self-actualization'&lt;ref&gt;Frank G. Goble, ''The Third Force: The Psychology of Abraham Maslow'' (New York 1970) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; – and is considered a part of the humanistic approach to personality. [[Humanistic psychology]] is one of several methods used in psychology for studying, understanding, and evaluating personality. The humanistic approach was developed because other approaches, such as the psychodynamic approach made famous by [[Sigmund Freud]], focused on unhealthy individuals that exhibited disturbed behavior;&lt;ref name="Gleitman and Reisberg"/&gt; whereas the humanistic approach focuses on healthy, motivated people and tries to determine how they define the self while maximizing their potential.&lt;ref name="Gleitman and Reisberg"/&gt;

Stemming from this branch of psychology is Maslow's hierarchy of needs. According to Maslow, people have lower order needs that in general must be fulfilled before high order needs can be satisfied: 'five sets of needs – physiological, safety, belongingness, [[self-esteem|esteem]], and self-actualization'.&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, ''Motivation'' (1967) p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

As a person moves up Maslow's hierarchy of needs, eventually they may find themselves reaching the summit — self-actualization.&lt;ref name="Gleitman and Reisberg"/&gt; Maslow's hierarchy of needs begins with the most basic necessities deemed "the physiological needs" in which the individual will seek out items like [[food]] and water, and must be able to perform basic functions such as breathing and [[sleep]]ing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gleitman, Henry; Fridlund, Alan J. and Reisberg Daniel. ''Psychology.'' 6th ed. New York: Norton &amp; Company, 2004 and Maslow, Abraham H. ''The Psychology of Science.'' Gateway Edition 1.95 ed. Chicago: Henry Regnery Company, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Once these needs have been met, a person can move on to fulfilling "the safety needs", where they will attempt to obtain a sense of [[security]], physical [[comfort]]s and shelter, employment, and property.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The next level is "the belongingness and love needs", where people will strive for social [[acceptance]], affiliations, a sense of [[belongingness]] and being welcome, sexual [[intimacy]], and perhaps a [[family]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Next are "the esteem needs", where the individual will desire a sense of [[Skill|competence]], recognition of achievement by peers, and [[respect]] from others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Some argue that once these needs are met, an individual is primed for self-actualization. Others maintain that there are two more phases an individual must progress through before self-actualization can take place. These include "the cognitive needs", where a person will desire knowledge and an understanding of the world around them, and "the aesthetic needs" which include a need for "symmetry, order, and beauty".&lt;ref name="Gleitman and Reisberg"/&gt; Once all these needs have been satisfied, the final stage of Maslow's hierarchy—self actualization—can take place.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Classical Adlerian psychotherapy]] promotes this level of psychological development, utilizing the foundation of a 12-stage therapeutic model to realistically satisfy the basic needs, leading to an advanced stage of "meta-therapy," creative living, and self/other/task-actualization{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. [[Gestalt therapy]], acknowledging that 'Kurt Goldstein first introduced the concept of the ''organism as a whole'' ', built on the assumption that "every individual, every plant, every animal has only one inborn goal – to actualize itself as it is."&lt;ref&gt;Frederick S. Perls, ''Gestalt Therapy Verbatim'' (Bantam 1974) p. 6 and p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Maslow's writings are used as inspirational resources.  The key to Maslow's writings is understanding that there are no quick routes to becoming self-actualizing: rather it is predicated on the individual having their lower deficiency needs met. Once a person has moved through feeling and believing that they are deficient, they naturally seek to grow into who they are, that is self-actualize. Elsewhere, however, Maslow (2011) and Carl Rogers (1980)&lt;ref name = Rogers1980&gt;Rogers, Carl R. ''A Way of Being.'' Boston: Houghton-Mifflin, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; both suggested necessary attitudes and/or attributes that need to be inside an individual as a pre-requisite for self-actualization. Amongst these, are: a real wish to be themselves, to be fully human, to fulfill themselves, to be completely alive, as well as to risk being vulnerable, and uncovering more 'painful' aspects in order to learn about/grow through and integrate these parts of themselves (which has parallels with Jung’s slightly similar concept of [[individuation]]).

Although initially being biologically-centered (or focused around the more ordinary, psychological self-nature), both Maslow (2011) and Rogers (1980) became more open to 'spirituality' and grew to accept a more open and ‘spiritual’ conception of man before the end of their lives. Also, there have been many similarities and cross-references between various spiritual schools or groups (particularly Eastern spiritual ways) in the past 40 years.&lt;ref name = Koltko/&gt;&lt;ref name = Rogers1980/&gt; One can also suggest that Sri Ramana Maharshi’s description, that complete and spiritual self-realisation is characterized by 'Being' (sat), 'Consciousness' (chit) and 'Bliss' (Ananda), is a reflection of humanistic thinking or experience; that the experience of a self-actualizing person partakes in these things to some degree: 'beingness,' 'awareness,' and a 'meaningful happiness,' even if one can go further than mere self-actualization into Self-transcendence, where Being-Consciousness-Bliss fully form.&lt;ref name = Koltko/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Godman, David (ed.). ‘Be as You Are’, The Teaching of Sri Ramana Maharishi’. London, Arkana. 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Maslow early noted his impression that "impulsivity, the unrestrained expression of any whim, the direct seeking for 'kicks' and for non-social and purely private pleasures...is often mislabelled self-actualization."&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, in Michael Daniels, ''Shadow, Self, Spirit'' (2005) p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, "self-actualization" is little more than what [[Eric Berne]] described as the game of '"Self-Expression"...based on the dogma "Feelings are Good"'.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Games People Play'' (Penguin) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Broader criticism from within humanistic psychology of the concept of self-actualization includes the danger that 'emphasis on the actualizing tendency...can lead to a highly positive view of the human being but one which is strangely non-relational'.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Thorne, ''Carl Rogers'' (London 1992) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Fritz Perls]] there is also the risk of confusing "''self''-actualizing and self-''image'' actualizing...the curse of the ideal."&lt;ref&gt;Perls, ''Verbatim'' p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; By conflating "the ''virtue'' of self-actualization and the ''reality'' of self-actualization,"&lt;ref&gt;Frederick S. Perls, ''In and Out the Garbage Pail'' (London 1981) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; the latter becomes merely another measuring rod for the "topdog" – the nagging conscience: "You tell me to do things. You tell me to be – ''real''. You tell me to be self-actualized...I don't have to be that good!"&lt;ref&gt;"Jane" in Perls, ''Verbatim'' p. 292-3&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Barry Stevens (therapist)|Barry Stevens]] remarks: "Abe Maslow was unhappy with what happened with many people when they read what he wrote about 'self-actualizing people'. What they did with it was very strange. I have received a fair number of letters saying 'I am a self-actualized person'. Maslow said that he must have left something out. Fritz (Perls) put it in. He saw that most people actualized a self-concept. This is not ''self''-actualizing."&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, B. (1975): ''Body Work'', in: Stevens, J.O., (ed.): ''gestalt is''. Moab, Utah, 1975 (Real People Press), p. 183/184.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul Vitz]], this may be connected with the charge that "Rogers and Maslow both transform self-actualization from a descriptive notion into a moral norm";&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Vitz, ''Psychology as Religion'' (1994) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; although if it is indeed as good a reality as they purport, then a certain eagerness in their communication is understandable.

In general, during the early twenty-first-century, "the usefulness of the concepts of self and self-actualization continue to attract discussion and debate."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Engler, ''Personality Theories'' (2008) p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, there may be a common feeling that the possibility of 'self-actualization' is reserved for those people who have been lucky in life and don't have to struggle for their day-to-day survival in a dead-end job. Notwithstanding, Maslow (2011) suggested that it was very much about the attitude the individual brought to his/her life that might be the crucial catalyst for where one’s life and self-growth goes. There are many examples of when people have been in basically the same circumstances, but have turned out very differently, which might indicate that attitude can have an enormous bearing upon one's fate; however, there is always the question: what ''is'' it that makes attitude different from person to person?

== Self-actualization in Carl Rogers' [[person-centred personality theory]] ==
[[Carl Rogers]] used the term self-actualization to describe something distinct from the concept developed by Maslow: the actualization of the individual's sense of 'self'.&lt;ref name="Rogers, C. R. 2015 p. 489"&gt;Rogers, C. R. (1951/2015) Client-centred therapy. London: Robinson. p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt;  In person-centred theory self-actualization is the ongoing process of maintaining and enhancing the individual's self-concept through reflection, reinterpretation of experience, allowing the individual to recover, develop, change and grow.  Self-actualization is a subset of the overall organismic [[actualizing tendency]] and begins with the infant learning to differentiate what is 'self' and what is 'other' within its 'total perceptual field',&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, C. R. (1951/2015) Client-centred therapy. London: Robinson. p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; as their full self-awareness gradually crystallizes.  Interactions with significant others are key to the process of self-actualization: 'As a result of interaction with the environment, and particularly as a result of evaluational interaction with others, the structure of the self is formed - an organized, fluid but consistent conceptual pattern of perceptions of characteristics and relationships of the 'I' or the 'me', together with the values attached to these concepts'.&lt;ref name="Rogers, C. R. 2015 p. 489"/&gt;

The process of self-actualization is continuous as the individual matures into a socially competent, interdepedent autonomy, and is ongoing throughout the life-cycle.  When there is sufficient tension between the individual's sense of self and their experience, a psychopathological state of [[Carl Rogers#Incongruence|incongruence]] can arise: '...I believe that individuals are culturally conditioned, rewarded, reinforced, for behaviors which are in fact perversions of the natural directions of the unitary actualizing tendency'.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, C. R. (1963) The actualizing tendency in relation to 'motive' and to consciousness. In M. Jones (ed.) Nebraska Symposium on Motivation 1963. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. pp.1-24&lt;/ref&gt;  In Rogers' theory self-actualization is not the end-point, it is the process that can, in conducive circumstances (in particular the presence of positive [[self-regard]] and the [[empathic understanding]] of others), lead to the individual becoming more '[[fully-functioning]]'.

'''Self-realization''' is an expression used in Western [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[spirituality]]; and in [[Indian religions]]. In the Western understanding it is the "fulfillment by oneself of the possibilities of one's character or personality."&lt;ref name=SR/&gt; In the Indian understanding, self-realization is [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|liberating knowledge]] of the true Self, either as the permanent undying Atman, or as the absence (''sunyata'') of such a permanent Self.

==Western understanding==
Merriam Webster's dictionary defines self-realization as:
{{quote|Fulfillment by oneself of the possibilities of one's character or personality.&lt;ref name="SR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/self-realization |title=Self-realization|accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Western world "self-realization" has gained great popularity. Influential in this popularity were psycho-analysis, humanistic psychology, the growing acquaintance with Eastern religions, and the growing popularity of Western [[esotericism]].

===Psychoanalysis===
Though [[Sigmund Freud]] was skeptical of religion and esotericism, his theories have had a lasting influence on Western thought and self-understanding. His notion of repressed memories, though based on false assumptions, has become part of mainstream thought.{{sfn|Webster|1996}}

Freud's ideas were further developed by his students and neo-psycho-analysts. [[Carl Jung]], [[Erik Erikson]], and [[Winnicott]] have been especially important in the Western understanding of the self. But other alternatives have also been developed.

Jung developed the notion of [[individuation]], the lifelong process in which the centre of psychological life shifts from the ego to the self.

Erikson described human development throughout the life-span in his [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|theory of psychosocial development]].

[[Winnicott]] developed the notion of the [[True self and false self|true self]].

Roberto Assagioli developed his approach of [[Psychosynthesis]], an original approach to psychology.

===Western esotericism===
Western [[esotericism]] integrates a broad variety of traditions, some of which view self-realization as the ultimate goal of a human being.{{who|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Indian religions==
===Jainism===
[[Jain]] philosophy is the oldest world philosophy that separates body ([[matter]]) from the [[soul]] (consciousness) completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya – Jainism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Individual conscience and individual consciousness are central in the [[Jain philosophy]]. Self-realisation is one of the major pre-requisites to attain ultimate enlightenment and liberation ([[moksha]]). Self-realisation means peeling away fabricated layers of own personality to understand the true self and hence the true nature of reality. In Jainism, [[karma]] is portrayed as invisible particles of subtle matter that adhere to a living organism or [[Jiva]]. These particles come together to form a film of negativity and darkness around the soul that obscures the true consciousness; making the Jiva lose touch with its original essence as a [[soul]]. These karmic particles tend to attract more such particles which cause the inflow of auspicious and evil karmic matter into the soul ([[Āsrava]]), leading the organism to fall into the bondage of lust, worldly pleasures, ego, hatred, jealousy, anger, etc. Thus self-realisation paves the way to simply reverse this process and help the seeker to decipher the absolute truth on its own. Jainism firmly rejects the belief of a creator, and one being is solely responsible for his thoughts, actions, and their consequences.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=CIgqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=self+realisation+Jainism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD8-qum9TcAhWVWysKHZA3CTMQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=self%20realisation%20Jainism&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shrimadrajchandramission.org/pujya-gurudevshri/pearls-of-wisdom/is-self-realisation-possible-in-present-times-4002.htm|title=Is Self-realisation Possible in Present Times?|author=|date=|website=www.shrimadrajchandramission.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=4K9GDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Samyak+darshan+Samyak+gnana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtx9eU3s7ZAhVTObwKHc6sDnQQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Samyak%20darshan%20Samyak%20gnana&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{Expert needed|Hinduism
}}
In [[Hinduism]], self-realization (''[[Atman jnana|atma-jnana]]'' or ''atmabodha'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dict.hinkhoj.com/%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%A7-meaning-in-english.words?amp=1|title=आत्मबोध|last=|first=|date=|website=dict.hinkhoj.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is knowledge of the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|true self]] beyond both delusion and identification with material phenomena. It refers to self-identification and not mere ego identification{{Clarify|reason=|date=August 2018}}.

====Shaivism====
In  [[Shaivism]], self-realization is the direct knowing of the Self God [[Parashiva]]. Self-realization ([[nirvikalpa]] [[samadhi]], which means "ecstasy without form or seed," or asamprajñata samādhi) is considered the ultimate spiritual attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.himalayanacademy.com/media/books/dancing-with-siva/web/glossary_c.html|title=Glossary - "Self Realization"|last=Sivaya|first=Subramuniyaswami|last3=|publisher=Himalayan academy|year=1997|isbn=9780945497974|location=USA|page=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Self-realization is considered the gateway to [[moksha]], liberation/freedom from rebirth. This state is attained when the [[Kundalini]] force pierces through the [[Sahasrara|Sahasrara chakra]] at the crown of the head. The realization of Self, [[Parashiva]], considered to be each soul's destiny, is attainable through renunciation, sustained meditation and preventing the germination of future [[karma]] (the phrase "frying the seeds of karma" is often used)&lt;ref&gt;Veeraswamy Krishnaraj, ''The Bhagavad-Gita: Translation and Commentary'' pp. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.himalayanacademy.com/media/books/dancing-with-siva/web/ch01_05.html|title=Dancing with Siva|last=Subramuniyaswami|first=Sivaya|publisher=Himalayan academy|year=1997|isbn=9780945497974|location=USA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advaita Vedanta====
Ātman is the [[first principle]] in Advaita Vedanta, along with its concept of Brahman, with Atman being the perceptible personal particular and Brahman the inferred unlimited universal, both synonymous and interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Deussen, Paul and Geden, A. S. (2010), The Philosophy of the Upanishads, Cosimo Classics, pp. 86-87. {{ISBN|1-61640-240-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The soteriological goal, in Advaita, is to gain self-knowledge and complete understanding of the identity of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and [[Brahman]]. Correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman leads dissolution of all dualistic tendencies and to [[Moksha|liberation]]. Moksha is attained by realizing one's true identity as Ātman, and the identity of Atman and Brahman, the complete understanding of one's real nature as Brahman in this life.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}} This is stated by Shankara as follows:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
I am other than name, form and action.
My nature is ever free!
I am Self, the supreme unconditioned Brahman.
I am pure Awareness, always non-dual.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Adi Shankara, [[Upadesasahasri]] 11.7|{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}}}}

===Buddhism===
{{main|Enlightenment in Buddhism}}

Since [[Buddhism]] denies the existence of a separate self, as explicated in the teachings of [[anatman]] and [[sunyata]], self-realization is a ''contradictio in terminis'' for Buddhism. Though the [[tathagatagarbha|tathagatagarbha-teachings]] seem to teach the existence of a separate self, they point to the inherent possibility of attaining [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], not to the existence of a separate self. The [[dharmadhatu|dharmadhatu-teachings]] make this even more clear: reality is an undivided whole; awakening is the realization of this whole.

===Sikhism===
{{main|Sikh philosophy}}

[[Sikhism]] propounds the philosophy of Self-realization. This is possible by "aatam-cheennea"&lt;ref&gt;[[Guru Granth Sahib|Sri Guru Granth Sahib]], page 375&lt;/ref&gt; or "Aap Pashaanae", purifying the self from the false ego:&lt;ref&gt;SGGS: P.1056&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|'Atam-cheene' is self-analysis, which is gained by peeping into one's self in the light of the teachings of ''[[Guru Granth Sahib|Sri Guru Granth Sahib]]''. It is the process of evaluating and analyzing oneself on the touchstone of 'naam simran' which if practised, pierces into the self and washes it from within. The filth of too much of materialism goes, the self gets purified and the mind comes in 'charhdi kala/higher state of mind". This means that the self should be assessed, examined and purified, leading to self-realization and the purification of our mind. Once purified the mind helps in ushering in oneness with the Super Power as the Guru says, "Atam-cheen bhae nirankari" (SGGS:P. 415) which means that one gets attuned to the Formless Lord through self-realization. Indirectly it means that self-realization leads to God-realization.{{sfn|Majhail (Dr.)|2010|p=272}}}}

[[Guru Nanak]] says,
{{quote|Those who realize their self get immersed in the Lord Himself.&lt;ref&gt;SGGS: P. 421&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|He who realizes his self, comes to know the essence.&lt;ref&gt;SGGS: P. 224&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Sentences of Sextus''' is a [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] text, modified to reflect a Christian viewpoint which was popular among [[Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Domach|2013|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest mention of the ''Sentences'' is in the mid 3rd century by [[Origen]].&lt;ref&gt;Origen, ''Contra Celsum'', viii. 30; ''Commentary on Matthew'', xv. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Origen quotes Sextus on self-castration, a widespread habit among ascetic early Christians, which Origen deplores, and mentions in passing that the work is one "that many considered to be tested by time."&lt;ref&gt;Origen, [http://www.well.com/~aquarius/origen-matthew.htm ''Commentary on Matthew''], xv. 3&lt;/ref&gt; While previously known from other versions, a partial [[Coptic language|Coptic]] translation appears in one of the books of the [[New Testament apocrypha]] recovered in the [[Nag Hammadi library]].

==Contents==
The work is similar to the [[New Testament apocrypha|sayings gospels]] called the [[Gospel of Phillip]] and the [[Gospel of Thomas]] in that it is purely a collection of sayings, with no bridging framework. Unlike the Christian sayings gospels, the wisdom comes from a man named ''Sextus'' rather than Jesus. Sextus appears to have been a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]]. Some of the 451&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Domach|2013|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; sentences are:
*''The soul is illuminated by the recollection of deity''
*''Bear that which is necessary, as it is necessary''
*''Be not anxious to please the multitude''
*''Esteem nothing so precious, which a bad man may take from you''
*''Use lying like poison''
*''Guard yourself from lying. (Because when you lie) there is a deceiver and the deceived.''
*''Nothing is so peculiar to wisdom as truth''
*''Wish that you may be able to benefit your enemies''
*''A wise intellect is the mirror of God''
*''Cast away any part of the body that would cause you not to live abstinently. For it is better to live abstinently without this part than ruinously with it.'' (quoted by [[Origen]])

==Authorship==
One possible author of the ''Sentences'' is [[Quintus Sextius]], a Roman philosopher who combined [[Stoicism]] with [[Pythagoreanism]], and who lived in the 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Gummere, (1917), ''Seneca, Epistles 1-65'', page 412. Loeb Classical Library.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time that [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] translated the ''Sentences'' into [[Latin]] (c. 400), the work had become attributed to [[Pope]] [[Sixtus II]],&lt;ref&gt;Martha Lee Turner, (1996) "The Sentences of Sextus and Related Collections" in ''The Gospel according to Philip'', page 104. BRILL.&lt;/ref&gt; in early times one of the most venerated of all church figures. It is unlikely that he authored the text (partly as he wasn't Pythagorean). Such attribution to important figures, which frequently happened in the apocrypha, was usually an attempt to give them more authority.

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Speciesism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|p|iː|ʃ|iː|ˌ|z|ɪ|z|ə|m|,_|-|s|iː|ˌ|z|ɪ|z|-}}) is a form of discrimination based on [[species]] membership.&lt;ref name="Baumann 2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Baumann |first1=Tobias |title=The Case Against Speciesism |url=https://sentience-politics.org/philosophy/the-case-against-speciesism/ |website=Reducing Risks of Future Suffering |accessdate=2 December 2018 |date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yancy &amp; Singer 2015"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yancy |first1=George |last2=Singer |first2=Peter |title=Peter Singer: On Racism, Animal Rights and Human Rights |url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/peter-singer-on-speciesism-and-racism/ |website=The Stone |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=3 December 2018|date=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves treating members of one species as morally more important than members of other species even when their interests are equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Duignan |first1=Brian |title=Speciesism |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/speciesism |website=Encyclopaedia Britannica |accessdate=3 December 2018 |ref=Dunigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animal-ethics.org/ethics-animals-section/speciesism/ |title=Speciesism |website=Animal Ethics |accessdate=3 December 2018 |ref=Animal Ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, speciesism is the failure to consider interests of equal strength to an equal extent because of the species of which the individuals are a member.&lt;ref name="Baumann 2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is often used by [[animal rights]] advocates, who argue that speciesism is a prejudice similar to [[racism]] or [[sexism]], in that the treatment of individuals is predicated on group membership and morally irrelevant physical differences. Their claim is that species membership has no moral significance.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder (2009), p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a speciesist belief would be the following. Suppose that both a [[dog]] and a [[cow]] need their tails removed for medical reasons. Suppose someone believes that the dog and the cow have equivalent interests, but insists that the dog receive pain relief for the operation, but is fine with the cow’s tail being [[Docking_(animal)#Cattle|docked]] without pain relief, remarking, “it’s just a cow.” This belief is speciesist because the cow’s species is being used as an excuse for not taking her interest in not suffering intense [[Pain in animals|pain]] into account.

It is possible to give more consideration to members of one species than to members of another species without being speciesist.&lt;ref name="Yancy &amp; Singer 2015"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider the belief that a typical human has an interest in voting but that a typical [[gorilla]] does not. This belief can involve starting with a premise that a certain feature of a being—such as being able to understand and participate in a political system in which one has a political representative—is relevant no matter the being's species. For someone holding this belief, a test for whether the belief is speciesist would be whether they would believe a gorilla who could understand and participate in a political system in which she had a political representative would have an interest in voting.

There are at least two common speciesist paradigms. The first involves simply considering [[humans]] superior to other [[animals]]. This is often called [[Anthropocentrism|human supremacism]]—the exclusion of all nonhuman animals from the rights, freedoms, and protections afforded to humans.&lt;ref name="Cavalieri2001p70"/&gt; The second paradigm involves considering certain [[nonhuman]] animals to be superior to others because of an arbitrary similarity to humans. For example, what could be called "human-chimpanzee speciesism" would involve human beings favoring rights for chimpanzees over rights for (say) dolphins, because of happenstance similarities between chimpanzees have to humans that dolphins do not.&lt;ref name=Waldau2001p5&gt;Waldau (2001), pp. 5, 23–29&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origin of the term===
{{further|Animals, Men and Morals|Oxford Group (animal rights)}}
[[File:Richard D Ryder in The Superior Human (2012).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Richard D. Ryder]] coined the term "speciesism" in 1970]]
The term ''speciesism'', and the argument that it is simply a prejudice, first appeared in 1970 in a privately printed pamphlet written by British psychologist [[Richard D. Ryder]]. Ryder was a member of a group of intellectuals in Oxford, England, the nascent animal rights community, now known as the [[Oxford Group (animal rights)|Oxford Group]]. One of the group's activities was distributing pamphlets about areas of concern; the pamphlet titled "Speciesism" was written to protest against [[Animal testing|animal experimentation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryder (2000), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryder argued in the pamphlet that "[s]ince Darwin, scientists have agreed that there is no 'magical' essential difference between humans and other animals, biologically-speaking. Why then do we make an almost total distinction morally? If all organisms are on one physical continuum, then we should also be on the same moral continuum." He wrote that, at that time in the UK, 5,000,000 animals were being used each year in experiments, and that attempting to gain benefits for our own species through the mistreatment of others was "just 'speciesism' and as such it is a selfish emotional argument rather than a reasoned one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalsocietyjournal.org.uk/Archives_files/1.%20Speciesism%20Again.pdf|title=Ryder (2010)|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114004403/http://www.criticalsocietyjournal.org.uk/Archives_files/1.%20Speciesism%20Again.pdf|archivedate=14 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryder used the term again in an essay, "Experiments on Animals", in ''[[Animals, Men and Morals]]'' (1971), a collection of essays on animal rights edited by philosophy graduate students Stanley and Roslind Godlovitch and John Harris, who were also members of the Oxford Group. Ryder wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In as much as both "race" and "species" are vague terms used in the classification of living creatures according, largely, to physical appearance, an analogy can be made between them. Discrimination on grounds of race, although most universally condoned two centuries ago, is now widely condemned. Similarly, it may come to pass that enlightened minds may one day abhor "speciesism" as much as they now detest "racism." The illogicality in both forms of prejudice is of an identical sort. If it is accepted as morally wrong to deliberately inflict suffering upon innocent human creatures, then it is only logical to also regard it as wrong to inflict suffering on innocent individuals of other species. ... The time has come to act upon this logic.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder (1971), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those who claim that speciesism is unfair to non-human species have often argued their case by invoking mammals and chickens in the context of research or farming.&lt;ref name="Sztybel 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/196512|title=Can the Treatment of Animals Be Compared to the Holocaust?|first=David|last=Sztybel|date=20 April 2006|journal=Ethics &amp; the Environment|volume=11|issue=1|pages=97–132|accessdate=29 August 2017|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/een.2006.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World Day Against Speciesism"&gt;[http://www.peta.org/blog/world-day-speciesism/ "World Day Against Speciesism"] PETA.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D. Ryder|Ryder, Richard D.]] (1975). ''Victims of Science: The Use of Animals in Research'', Davis-Poynter.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is not yet a clear definition or line agreed upon by a significant segment of the movement as to which species are to be treated equally with humans or in some ways additionally protected: mammals, birds, reptiles, arthropods, insects, bacteria, etc.

===Spread of the idea===
[[File:Peter Singer MIT Veritas.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Peter Singer]] popularized the idea in ''Animal Liberation'' (1975)]]
The term was popularized by the Australian philosopher [[Peter Singer]] in his book ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975). Singer had known Ryder from his own time as a graduate philosophy student at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond (2004), p. 93; Singer (1990), pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt; He credited Ryder with having coined the term and used it in the title of his book's fifth chapter: "Man's Dominion ... ''a short history of speciesism''", defining it as "a prejudice or attitude of bias in favour of the interests of members of one's own species and against those of members of other species":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Racists violate the principle of equality by giving greater weight to the interests of members of their own race when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of another race. Sexists violate the principle of equality by favouring the interests of their own sex. Similarly, speciesists allow the interests of their own species to override the greater interests of members of other species. The pattern is identical in each case.&lt;ref&gt;Singer (1990), pp. 6, 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Singer argued from a [[Preference utilitarianism|preference-utilitarian]] perspective, writing that speciesism violates the principle of [[equal consideration of interests]], the idea based on [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s principle: "each to count for one, and none for more than one". Singer argued that, although there may be differences between humans and nonhumans, they share the capacity to suffer, and we must give equal consideration to that suffering. Any position that allows similar cases to be treated in a dissimilar fashion fails to qualify as an acceptable moral theory. The term caught on; Singer wrote that it was an awkward word but that he could not think of a better one. It became an entry in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' in 1985, defined as "discrimination against or exploitation of animal species by human beings, based on an assumption of mankind's superiority".&lt;ref name=Wise2004p26&gt;Wise (2004), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 the ''Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy'' offered a wider definition: "By analogy with racism and sexism, the improper stance of refusing respect to the lives, dignity, or needs of animals of other than the human species."&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn (1994), p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, animal rights groups such as [[Farm Animal Rights Movement]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.farmusa.org/world-day-against-speciesism/ "World Day Against Speciesism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528011626/http://blog.farmusa.org/world-day-against-speciesism/ |date=2015-05-28 }} FARM Blog&lt;/ref&gt; and [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]]&lt;ref name="World Day Against Speciesism"/&gt; have attempted to popularize the concept by promoting a World Day Against Speciesism on June 5.

==Arguments against==

===Moral community, argument from marginal cases===
[[File:Trial of Bill Burns.jpg|thumb|220px|The Trial of Bill Burns (1838) in London showing [[Richard Martin (Irish politician)|Richard Martin]] (MP for Galway) in court with a donkey beaten by his owner, leading to the world's first known conviction for animal cruelty]]
[[Paola Cavalieri]] writes that the current [[Humanism|humanist]] paradigm is that only human beings are members of the moral community, and that all are worthy of equal protection. Species membership, she writes, is ''ipso facto'' moral membership. The paradigm has an inclusive side (all human beings deserve equal protection) and an exclusive one (only human beings have that status).&lt;ref name=Cavalieri2001p70&gt;Cavalieri (2001), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

She writes that it is not only philosophers who have difficulty with this concept.&lt;ref name=Cavalieri2001p70/&gt; [[Richard Rorty]] (1931–2007) argued that most human beings – those outside what he called our "Eurocentric human rights culture" – are unable to understand why membership of a species would in itself be sufficient for inclusion in the moral community: "Most people live in a world in which it would be just too risky – indeed, it would often be insanely dangerous – to let one's sense of moral community stretch beyond one's family, clan or tribe." Rorty wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Such people are ''morally'' offended by the suggestion that they should treat someone who is not kin as if he were a brother, or a nigger as if he were white, or a queer as if he were normal, or an infidel as if she were a believer. They are offended by the suggestion that they treat people whom they do not think of as human as if they were human. When utilitarians tell them that all pleasures and pains felt by members of our biological species are equally relevant to moral deliberation, or when Kantians tell them that the ability to engage in such deliberation is sufficient for membership in the moral community, they are incredulous. They rejoin that these philosophers seem oblivious to blatantly obvious moral distinctions, distinctions that any decent person will draw.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty (1998), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Much of humanity is similarly offended by the suggestion that the moral community be extended to nonhumans. Nonhumans do possess some moral status in many societies, but it generally extends only to protection against what Cavalieri calls "wanton cruelty".&lt;ref name=Cavalieri2001p70/&gt; Anti-speciesists argue that the extension of moral membership to all humanity, regardless of individual properties such as intelligence, while denying it to nonhumans, also regardless of individual properties, is internally inconsistent. According to the [[argument from marginal cases]], if infants, the senile, the comatose, and the cognitively disabled (marginal-case human beings) have a certain moral status, then nonhuman animals must be awarded that status too, since there is no morally relevant ability that the marginal-case humans have that nonhumans lack.&lt;!--source--&gt;

American legal scholar [[Steven M. Wise]] argues that speciesism is a bias as arbitrary as any other. He cites the philosopher [[R.G. Frey]] (1941–2012), a leading animal rights critic, who wrote in 1983 that, if forced to choose between abandoning experiments on animals and allowing experiments on "marginal-case" humans, he would choose the latter, "not because I begin a monster and end up choosing the monstrous, but because I cannot think of anything at all compelling that cedes all human life of any quality greater value than animal life of any quality".&lt;ref&gt;Wise (2004), p. 26, citing Frey (1983), pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Discontinuous mind"===
[[File:Dawkins at UT Austin detail.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Richard Dawkins]] argues against speciesism as an example of the "discontinuous mind"]]
[[Richard Dawkins]], the evolutionary biologist, argued against speciesism in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' (1986), ''[[Great Ape Project#Great Ape Project (book)|The Great Ape Project]]'' (1993), and ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), elucidating the connection with [[Neo-Darwinism|evolutionary theory]]. He compares former racist attitudes and assumptions to their present-day speciesist counterparts. In the chapter "The one true tree of life" in ''The Blind Watchmaker'', he argues that it is not only zoological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] that is saved from awkward ambiguity by the extinction of intermediate forms, but also human ethics and law. Dawkins argues that what he calls the "discontinuous mind" is ubiquitous, dividing the world into units that reflect nothing but our use of language, and animals into discontinuous species:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/dawkins01.htm|title=Gaps in the Mind, by Richard Dawkins|website=www.animal-rights-library.com|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The director of a zoo is entitled to "put down" a chimpanzee that is surplus to requirements, while any suggestion that he might "put down" a redundant keeper or ticket-seller would be greeted with howls of incredulous outrage. The chimpanzee is the property of the zoo. Humans are nowadays not supposed to be anybody's property, yet the rationale for discriminating against chimpanzees is seldom spelled out, and I doubt if there is a defensible rationale at all. Such is the breathtaking speciesism of our Christian-inspired attitudes, the abortion of a single human [[zygote]] (most of them are destined to be spontaneously aborted anyway) can arouse more moral solicitude and righteous indignation than the vivisection of any number of intelligent adult chimpanzees! ... The only reason we can be comfortable with such a double standard is that the intermediates between humans and chimps are all dead.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins (1996), pp. 262–263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dawkins elaborated in a discussion with Singer at [[The Center for Inquiry]] in 2007, when asked whether he continues to eat meat: "It's a little bit like the position which many people would have held a couple of hundred years ago over [[slavery]]. Where lots of people felt morally uneasy about slavery but went along with it because the whole [[Economy of the Confederate States of America|economy of the South]] depended upon slavery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/richard_dawkins_science_and_the_new_atheism|title=Richard Dawkins - Science and the New Atheism|website=www.pointofinquiry.org|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal holocaust===
{{further|Animal rights and the Holocaust}}
[[David Sztybel]] argues in his paper, "Can the Treatment of Animals Be Compared to the Holocaust?" (2006), that the racism of the Nazis is comparable to the speciesism inherent in eating meat or using animal by-products, particularly those produced on factory farms.&lt;ref name="Sztybel 2006"/&gt; Y. Michael Barilan, an Israeli physician, argues that speciesism is not the same thing as Nazi racism, because the latter extolled the abuser and condemned the weaker and the abused. He describes speciesism as the recognition of rights on the basis of group membership, rather than solely on the basis of moral considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Speciesism as a precondition to justice|first=Y. Michael|last=Barilan|date=March 2004 |journal=Politics and the Life Sciences|volume=23|issue=1|pages=22–33 |doi=10.2990/1471-5457(2004)23[22:SAAPTJ]2.0.CO;2|pmid=16859377|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centrality of consciousness===
"Libertarian extension" is the idea that the intrinsic value of nature can be extended beyond sentient beings.&lt;ref&gt;Vardy and Grosch (1999)&lt;!--page number?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This seeks to apply the principle of individual rights not only to all animals but also to objects without a nervous system such as trees, plants, and rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Holden (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Ryder rejects this argument, writing that "value cannot exist in the absence of consciousness or potential consciousness. Thus, rocks and rivers and houses have no interests and no rights of their own. This does not mean, of course, that they are not of value to us, and to many other painients, including those who need them as habitats and who would suffer without them."&lt;ref&gt;Ryder (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments in favor==

===Philosophical===
A common theme in defending speciesism is the argument that humans have the right to exploit other species to defend their own.&lt;ref&gt;Graft (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Carl Cohen (professor)|Carl Cohen]] argued in 1986: "Speciesism is not merely plausible; it is essential for right conduct, because those who will not make the morally relevant distinctions among species are almost certain, in consequence, to misapprehend their true obligations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/phil1200,Spr07/cohen.pdf|title=Cohen (1986)|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen writes that racism and sexism are wrong because there are no relevant differences between the sexes or races. Between people and animals, he argues, there are significant differences; his view is that animals do not qualify for [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian personhood, and as such have no rights.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (2001)&lt;!--page number--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nel Noddings]], the American feminist, has criticized Singer's concept of speciesism for being simplistic, and for failing to take into account the context of species preference, as concepts of racism and sexism have taken into account the context of discrimination against humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comment on Donovan's "Animal Rights and Feminist Theory"|first=Nel|last=Noddings|date=29 August 1991|journal=Signs|volume=16|issue=2|pages=418–422|doi=10.2307/3174525|jstor = 3174525|doi-broken-date = 2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Staudenmaier]] has argued that comparisons between speciesism and racism or sexism are trivializing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The central analogy to the civil rights movement and the women's movement is trivializing and ahistorical. Both of those social movements were initiated and driven by members of the dispossessed and excluded groups themselves, not by benevolent men or white people acting on their behalf. Both movements were built precisely around the idea of reclaiming and reasserting a shared humanity in the face of a society that had deprived it and denied it. No civil rights activist or feminist ever argued, "We're sentient beings too!" They argued, "We're fully human too!" Animal liberation doctrine, far from extending this humanist impulse, directly undermines it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communalism.org/Archive/5/aar.print.html|title=AAR Print|date=17 March 2005|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050317052329/http://www.communalism.org/Archive/5/aar.print.html|archivedate=17 March 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another criticism of animal-type anti-speciesism is based on the distinction between demanding rights one wants and being put into those one may not want. Many people who are now over 18 but remember their time as minors as a time when their alleged children's rights was legalized torture doubt if animal rights do animals any good, especially since animals cannot even say what they consider to be horrible. A distinction is made between people who are extrinsically denied their possibility to say what they think by 18 year limits, psychiatric diagnoses based on [[domain-specific]] hypotheses, or other constructed laws on one hand, and marginal case humans intrinsically incapable of opining about their situation on the other. The former is considered comparable to racism and sexism, the latter is considered comparable to animals.&lt;ref&gt;Ethics Without Indoctrination, Richard Paul 1988&lt;/ref&gt; This extends to questioning and rejecting the very definition of "wanton cruelty". One example that has been pointed out is that since we do not know whether or not animals are aware of [[death]], all ethical considerations on putting animals down are benighted.&lt;ref&gt;The thinker's guide to ethical reasoning, Linda Elder and Richard Paul 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of this way of partly accepting speciesism generally do not subscribe to arguments about alleged dehumanization or other legalistic type arguments, and have no problem with accepting possible future encounters with [[extraterrestrial intelligence]] or [[artificial intelligence]] as equals.&lt;ref&gt;At Home in the Cosmos, Esko Valtaoja 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook of International Relations, Robyn Eckersley 2008: 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ayn Rand]]'s [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] holds that humans are the only beings who have what Rand called a conceptual consciousness, and the ability to reason and develop a moral system. She argued that humans are therefore the only species entitled to rights. Randian philosopher [[Leonard Peikoff]] argued: "By its nature and throughout the animal kingdom, life survives by feeding on life. To demand that man defer to the 'rights' of ''other'' species is to deprive man himself of the right to life. This is 'other-ism,' i.e. altruism, gone mad."&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff (1991), p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

The British philosopher, [[Roger Scruton]], regards the emergence of the animal rights and anti-speciesism movement as "the strangest cultural shift within the liberal worldview", because the idea of rights and responsibilities is, he argues, distinctive to the human condition, and it makes no sense to spread them beyond our own species. Scruton argues that if animals have rights, then they also have duties, which animals would routinely violate, with almost all of them being "habitual law-breakers" and predatory animals such as foxes, wolves and killer whales being "inveterate murderers" who "should be permanently locked up". He accuses anti-speciesism advocates of "pre-scientific" [[anthropomorphism]], attributing traits to animals that are, he says, [[Beatrix Potter]]-like, where "only man is vile." It is, he argues, a fantasy, a world of escape.&lt;ref name=Scruton&gt;Scruton, Roger. [http://www.city-journal.org/html/10_3_urbanities-animal.html "Animal Rights"], ''City Journal'', summer 2000.

John Tuohey, founder of the Providence Center for Health Care Ethics, writes that the logic behind the anti-speciesism critique is flawed, and that, although the animal rights movement in the United States has been influential in slowing animal experimentation, and in some cases halting particular studies, no one has offered a compelling argument for species equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fifteen years after "Animal Liberation": has the animal rights movement achieved philosophical legitimacy?|first1=John|last1=Tuohey|first2=Terrence P.|last2=Ma|date=29 August 1992|journal=The Journal of Medical Humanities|volume=13|issue=2|pages=79–89|accessdate=|pmid=11652083|doi=10.1007/bf01149650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of speciesism believe that animals exist so that humans may make use of them. They argue that this special status conveys [[special rights]], such as the [[right to life]], and also unique responsibilities, such as [[Stewardship (theology)|stewardship]] of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. This belief in [[human exceptionalism]] is often rooted in the [[Abrahamic religion]]s, such as the [[Book of Genesis]] 1:26: "Then God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth." Animal rights advocates argue that dominion refers to stewardship, not ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Scully (2003)&lt;!--needs page number--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus Christ taught that a person is worth more than many sparrows.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 10:31&lt;/ref&gt;  But the [[Imago Dei]] may be [[personhood]] itself, although we humans have only achieved efficiencies in educating and otherwise acculturating humans. Proverbs 12:10 mentions that "The righteous one takes care of his domestic animals."{{npsn|date=July 2018}}

==Law and policy==
===Law===
The first major statute addressing animal protection in the United States, titled "An Act for the More Effectual Prevention of Cruelty to Animals", was enacted in 1867. It provided the right to incriminate and enforce protection with regards to animal cruelty. The act, which has since been revised to suit modern cases state by state, originally addressed such things as animal neglect, abandonment, torture, fighting, transport, impound standards, and licensing standards.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Michael S. (2015) "Animal Rights Movement." Ideas and Movements that shaped America: From the Bill of Right to Occupy Wall Street&lt;/ref&gt; Although an animal rights movement had already started as early as the late 1800s, some of the laws that would shape the way animals would be treated as industry grew, were enacted around the same time that Richard Ryder was bringing the notion of Speciesism to the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder,Richard 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation was being proposed and passed in the U.S. that would reshape animal welfare in industry and science. Bills such as 
[[Humane Slaughter Act]], which was created to alleviate some of the suffering felt by livestock during slaughter, was passed in 1958. Later the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966]], passed by President Lyndon B. Johnson, was designed to put much stricter regulations and supervisions on the handling of animals used in laboratory experimentation and exhibition but has since been amended and expanded.&lt;ref&gt;"Animal Welfare Act." United States Department of Agriculture, www.nal.usda.gov/awic/animal-welfare-act.&lt;/ref&gt; These groundbreaking laws foreshadowed and influenced the shifting attitudes toward nonhuman animals in their rights to humane treatment which [[Richard D. Ryder]] and [[Peter Singer]] would later popularize in the 1970s and 1980s.

===Great ape personhood===
{{further|Great ape personhood|Great Ape Project}}
Great ape personhood is the idea that the attributes of nonhuman [[great ape]]s are such that their sentience and personhood should be recognized by the law, rather than simply protecting them as a group under [[animal cruelty]] legislation. Awarding personhood to nonhuman primates would require that their individual interests be taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;Karcher (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sturm und Drang''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] in five acts by [[Friedrich Maximilian Klinger]], which gave its name to the artistic period known as [[Sturm und Drang]]. The play's original title was ''Wirrwarr''; it was changed to ''Sturm und Drang'' before premiering.

==Background==
In the autumn of 1776 Klinger wrote a comedy titled simply ''Wirrwarr'' ("confusion", "hubbub"). At that time he was already a well-known playwright; the year before, he had won a prize of 20 [[Louis d'or]] from the Ackermannschen Theatertruppe for his tragedy ''Die Zwillinge''. Klinger had followed [[Goethe]] to [[Weimar]]. {{Interlanguage link|Christoph Kaufmann|de}} suggested the title ''Sturm und Drang'' ("storm and urge", "storm and stress") in a letter to Klinger.&lt;ref&gt;Karthaus, Ulrich: Sturm und Drang. Epoche-Werke-Wirkung. München: C.H.Beck Verlag, 2. aktualisierte Auflage. 2007, S. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was created in the year that is commonly seen as the high-water-mark of the Sturm und Drang movement.

Klinger brought the piece with him when he joined [[Abel Seyler]]'s [[Seyler theatrical company|famed theatrical company]]. Klinger would be employed as a playwright by the company for two years. The company premiered ''Sturm und Drang'' in [[Leipzig]] on 1 April 1777. Neither the world premiere nor the subsequent performance in Klinger's hometown of [[Frankfurt]] were successful.

The influence of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] can be seen in the feud (reminiscent of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'') between the Berkley and Bushy families. Additionally, the names "Bushy" and "Berkley" are borrowed from the surnames of two minor characters in ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]''; the name "La Feu" ("Lafew") comes from ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]''.

More important than this evidence of enthusiasm for Shakespeare and other authors, however, is the title ''Sturm und Drang'' itself, which soon became the watchword for [[Sturm und Drang|an artistic movement]].

==Characters==
* Wild (alias Karl Bushy)
* La Feu and Blasius, two friends of Wild
* Lord Berkley
* Jenny Caroline, daughter of Lord Berkley
* Lady Kathrin, sister to Lord Berkley
* Louise, niece of Lord Berkley
* Captain Boyet (alias Harry Berkley, Lord Berkley's long-lost son)
* Lord Bushy, Wild's father
* A young Moor, Boyet's slave
* The landlord
* Betty, a servant

==Synopsis==
The adventurous Wild has kidnapped his friends La Feu and Blasius against their will to America. There, Wild wants to participate in the [[American Revolutionary War]] (presumably on the side of the colonists). The trio stop at an inn; staying there also are the party of the aged Lord Berkley, his sister Lady Kathrin, his daughter Jenny Caroline, and their servant Louise. Berkley, ten years earlier, lost his estate through the actions of his enemies; he suspects that the mastermind is his former friend, Lord Bushy.

Wild and his friends meet the ladies of the Berkley party. La Feu falls in love with Lady Kathrin at first sight; Blasius, on the other hand, is bored with Louise. For her part, Caroline instantly recognizes Wild as her childhood sweetheart, Karl Bushy, the son and heir of her father's arch-enemy! The happy couple conceal Wild's true identity from Lord Berkley, who promises to procure a job in the army for Wild.

As Act 3 opens, Blasius and La Feu talk about Wild and the ladies. La Feu is still very enthusiastic about Lady Kathrin, which Blasius cannot understand because of her age. Blasius, sleepy and uninterested as usual, goes to bed.

Now the sea-captain Boyet arrives at the inn. Lord Berkley recognizes Captain Boyet as his long-lost son Harry, who has been missing since the raid on the Berkley estate ten years ago. Meanwhile, Boyet (alias Harry Berkley) has a history with Wild (alias Karl Bushy), for whom he feels a spontaneous aversion. The pair met and duelled once in Holland; now Boyet demands revenge for the wound he then received. In Wild's presence, Boyet triumphantly reports to his father that he has abandoned the old Lord Bushy in a small boat on the high seas, dooming Bushy to almost certain death. Wild angrily challenges Captain Boyet to a duel. Shortly thereafter, Lady Kathrin reveals to the Berkleys Wild's true identity, which she has learned from La Feu.

In Act 5, Wild and Boyet (that is, Karl and Harry) fight. Boyet is wounded in the calf and reluctantly recognizes Wild's bravery. Then, Wild receives word from the captain's slave-boy that, with the help of the ship's lieutenant, he had secretly brought old Bushy back on board Boyet's ship and not abandoned him at sea at all. In fact, the "dead" man suddenly appears, forgives his adversaries, and insists that he did not participate in the conspiracy against Berkley! Bushy does not reveal the real mastermind, as that man died long ago.

The old and the young Berkley hesitantly accept the offer of reconciliation, so deeply sits the hatred of long years. Nevertheless, the two reconcile and the feud is settled. Wild and Caroline can now devote themselves completely to their love. La Feu and Lady Kathrin also pair off to choose a romantic [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadian]] existence herding sheep. Blasius, whose grumpiness permanently deterred Louise, goes off to become a hermit.

==Analysis==
The names of impetuous Wild, romantic La Feu ("the fire"), and indifferent Blasius (whose name evokes the word "[[wikt:blasé|blasé]]") reflect their individual temperaments.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl.: Karthaus, Ulrich: Sturm und Drang. Epoche-Werke-Wirkung. München: C.H.Beck Verlag, 2. aktualisierte Auflage. 2007, S. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The play is nominally set in the midst of the [[American Revolutionary War]], but the war plays no part in the drama, which takes place entirely at an inn and is concerned entirely with the fortunes of the Bushy and Berkley families. However, as a backdrop, the colonists' violent rebellion is reminiscent of the kind of passionate individual expression celebrated by the ''Sturm und Drang'' movement.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl.: Karthaus, Ulrich: Sturm und Drang. Epoche-Werke-Wirkung. München: C.H.Beck Verlag, 2. aktualisierte Auflage. 2007, S. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

An anonymous reviewer complained in 1778:
{{cquote|
But how can a play be called tolerable with such a plot? One Lord Berkeley has, through one Bushy, lost his son. But where, how, when and why? nobody knows. The son returns as a sea-captain and is recognized by his father. How he was saved, how he comes to be a sea-captain; how he comes to his father's location, without knowing that he is there; this one also does not learn. A young man, who calls himself Wild, but who is the son of that Bushy, comes with two friends [...] How and why he came there; how and where he knew Berkley's daughter, with whom he is in love; and yet without knowing that her father and she are there; that is not said in the whole piece."&lt;ref&gt;Karthaus, Ulrich: Sturm und Drang. Epoch-Werke effect. Munich: C.H.Beck Verlag, 2nd updated edition. 2007, p. 108. {{quote|...aber wie kan ein Stük bei einem solchen Plane erträglich genant werden? Ein Lord Berkeley hat durch einen gewissen Bushy seinen Sohn verlohren. Wo aber, wie, wann und warum? das erfährt kein Mensch. Der Sohn kömt als Schifkapitän wieder, und wird von seinem Vater erkant. Wie er aber gerettet, wie er Schifkapitän geworden ist; wie er nun dahin kömt wo er seinen Vater antrift, ohne zu wissen, daß dieser da sei; das erfährt man wieder nicht. Ein junger Mensch, der sich Wild nent, der aber der Sohn jenes Bushy ist, kömt mit zwenen Freunden […] Wie aber und warum er dahin kömt; wie und wo er vorhero Berkleys Tochter, in der er und sie in ihn verliebt ist; gesehn hat, und dabei gar nicht weis daß ihr Vater und sie hier sind; das wird im ganzen Stücke nicht gesagt.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research work ==
Tatyana Kasatkina is one of the most prominent Russian specialists in the field of Dostoyevsky studies. A number of her research works were published not only in Russia but also in Great Britain, the USA, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Japan, China, etc.
She prepared for publication a new collection of works by F.M. Dostoyevsky, which is organized in a chronological order. Each volume contains not only Dostoyevsky's works of a respective period of his life but also letters and memoirs of his contemporaries that are followed by the comments of a new type — apart from the traditional literary notes there are interpreting ones. She carried out supervision of a number of thesis devoted to Dostoevsky's works.
She has given many seminars and lectures in different Russian cities (Moscow, Novosibirsk, Kemerovo, Rostov Veliky, Veliky Novgorod, Barnaul, Staraya Russa, etc.). In the period between 2009 and 2015, being invited by [[the Catholic movement Comunione e Liberazione]], Tatyana Kasatkina presented lectures on Dostoyevsky and Russian culture in the Universities of Italy (Rome, Milan, Florence, Bari, Venice etc.). Since 1999 she has been a research supervisor of the April Youth Conferences "F.M. Dostoevsky's Works in the Perception of the 21st Century Readers " in the town of Staraya Russa. She also gives seminars to the philologists of teaching professions in Veliky Novgorod.
T.A. Kasatkina's works are mainly devoted to the word's creative role in culture and to the nature of the artistic image. They are theoretical studies carried out at the intersection of theory of literature, cultural studies, philosophy, religious studies, etc. In her research, she often addresses problems of religion, [[mysticism]], symbolism and the ontological nature of things using as the material the works of Dostoevsky, [[Pushkin]], [[Lermontov]], [[Gogol]], [[Chekhov]], [[Alexander Blok|Blok]], etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5572">Among the [[Anishinaabe]] people, the '''Teachings of the Seven Grandfathers''', also known simply as either the '''Seven Teachings''' or '''Seven Grandfathers''', is a set of teachings on human conduct towards others.  Originating from traditional Anishinaabe teachings from elders, Edward Benton-Banai describes an in-depth understanding of what each means, in his novel "The Mishomis Book".  Benton-Banai's book is an example of contemporary Anishinaabe teachings to be used in contemporary situations.

== Background ==

In Edward Benton-Banai's story "The Mishomis Book" it is stated that the ''[[aadizookaan]]'' (traditional story) or the teachings of the seven grandfathers were given to the Anishinaabeg early in their history.  Seven Grandfathers asked their messenger to take a survey of the human condition.  At that time the human condition was not very good.  Eventually in his quest, the messenger came across a child.  After receiving approval from the Seven Grandfathers, tutored the child in the [[Midewiwin|"Good way of Life"]].  Before departing from the Seven Grandfathers, each of the Grandfathers instructed the child with a principle.

A very thorough re-formulation of a variety of ancient Anishinaabe/Midewiwin teachings on the ethics of proper behaviour and conduct.  Benton-Banai manages to incorporate many traditional teachings into his story about the Seven Grandfather Teachings.  Benton-Banai succeeds in showing how an Anishinaabe Traditional Teacher can borrow from traditional teachings and recombine and change them to make them relevant to contemporary issues faced by Anishinaabe people.

== Teachings ==

* '''''Nibwaakaawin''—Wisdom''': To cherish knowledge is to know Wisdom.  Wisdom is given by the Creator to be used for the good of the people.  In the [[Ojibwe language|Anishinaabe language]], this word expresses not only "wisdom," but also means "prudence," or "intelligence."  In some communities, '''''Gikendaasowin''''' is used; in addition to "wisdom," this word can also mean "intelligence" or "knowledge."
* '''''Zaagi'idiwin''—Love''': To know peace is to know Love.  Love must be unconditional. When people are weak they need love the most.  In the Anishinaabe language, this word with the reciprocal theme /idi/ indicates that this form of love is mutual.  In some communities, '''''Gizhaawenidiwin''''' is used, which in most context means "jealousy" but in this context is translated as either "love" or "zeal".  Again, the reciprocal theme /idi/ indicates that this form of love is mutual.
* '''''Minaadendamowin''—Respect''': To honor all creation is to have Respect. All of creation should be treated with respect. You must give respect if you wish to be respected.  Some communities instead use '''''Ozhibwaadenindiwin''''' or '''''Manazoonidiwin'''''.
* '''''Aakode'ewin''—Bravery''': Bravery is to face the foe with integrity. In the Anishinaabe language, this word literally means "state of having a fearless heart."  To do what is right even when the consequences are unpleasant.  Some communities instead use either '''''Zoongadikiwin''''' ("state of having a strong casing")  or '''''Zoongide'ewin''''' ("state of having a strong heart").
* '''''Gwayakwaadiziwin''—Honesty''': Honesty in facing a situation is to be brave. Always be honest in word and action. Be honest first with yourself, and you will more easily be able to be honest with others. In the Anishinaabe language, this word can also mean "righteousness."
* '''''Dabaadendiziwin''—Humility''': Humility is to know yourself as a sacred part of Creation.  In the Anishinaabe language, this word can also mean "compassion." You are equal to others, but you are not better. Some communities instead express this with ''''' Bekaadiziwin''''', which in addition to "humility" can also be translated as "calmness," "meekness," "gentility" or "patience."
* '''''Debwewin''—Truth''': Truth is to know all of these things. Speak the truth. Do not deceive yourself or others.

'''Temporal finitism''' is the doctrine that [[time]] is [[Infinity|finite]] in the [[past]]. The philosophy of [[Aristotle]], expressed in such works as his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', held that although space was finite, with only void existing beyond the outermost sphere of the heavens, time was infinite. This caused problems for [[Early Islamic philosophy|mediaeval Islamic]], [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish]], and [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosophers]], who were unable to reconcile the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] conception of the eternal with the [[Genesis creation narrative]].{{sfn|Feldman|1967|pp=113-37}}

Modern [[cosmogony]] accepts finitism, in the form of the [[Big Bang]], rather than [[Steady State theory]] which allows for an infinite universe, but on physical rather than philosophical grounds.

==Medieval background==
&lt;!-- Start of text to merge with Eternity of the World --&gt; 
In contrast to [[Ancient philosophy|ancient]] [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] who believed that the universe had an [[Infinity|infinite]] past with no beginning, [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] and [[Theology|theologians]] developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning. This view was inspired by the [[creation myth]] shared by the three [[Abrahamic religions]]: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].{{sfn|Craig|1979}}

Prior to [[Maimonides]], it was held that it was possible to prove, philosophically, creation theory. The [[Kalam cosmological argument]] held that creation was provable, for example. Maimonides himself held that neither creation nor Aristotle's infinite time were provable, or at least that no proof was available. (According to scholars of his work, he didn't make a formal distinction between unprovability and the simple absence of proof.) [[Thomas Aquinas]] was influenced by this belief, and held in his [[Summa Theologica]] that neither hypothesis was demonstrable. Some of Maimonides' Jewish successors, including [[Gersonides]] and [[Crescas]], conversely held that the question was decidable, philosophically.{{sfn|Feldman|1967}}

[[John Philoponus]] was probably the first to use the [[argument]] that infinite time is impossible in order to establish temporal finitism. He was followed by many others including St. [[Bonaventure]].

[[Philoponus]]' arguments for temporal finitism were severalfold.  ''Contra Aristotlem'' has been [[Lost works |lost]], and is chiefly known through the citations used by [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] in his commentaries on Aristotle's ''Physics'' and ''De Caelo''.  Philoponus' refutation of Aristotle extended to six books, the first five addressing ''De Caelo'' and the sixth addressing ''Physics'', and from comments on Philoponus made by Simplicius can be deduced to have been quite lengthy.{{sfn|Davidson|1969}}

A full exposition of Philoponus' several arguments, as reported by Simplicius, can be found in Sorabji.{{sfn|Sorabji|2005}}

One such argument was based upon Aristotle's own theorem that there were not multiple infinities, and ran as follows:  If time were infinite, then as the universe continued in existence for another hour, the infinity of its age since creation at the end of that hour must be one hour greater than the infinity of its age since creation at the start of that hour.  But since Aristotle holds that such treatments of infinity are impossible and ridiculous, the world cannot have existed for infinite time.

Philoponus′s works were adopted by many; his first argument against an infinite past being the "argument from the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite", which states:{{sfn|Craig|1979|pp=165-66}}
:"An actual infinite cannot exist."
:"An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite."
:"Thus an infinite temporal regress of events cannot exist."

This argument depends on the (unproved) assertion that an actual infinite cannot exist; and that an infinite past implies an infinite succession of "events", a word not clearly defined. The second argument, the "argument from the impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition", states:{{sfn|Craig|1979}}

:"An actual infinite cannot be completed by successive addition."
:"The temporal series of past events has been completed by successive addition."
:"Thus the temporal series of past events cannot be an actual infinite."

The first statement states, correctly, that a finite (number) cannot be made into an infinite one by the finite addition of more finite numbers. The second skirts around this; the analogous idea in mathematics, that the (infinite) sequence of negative integers "..-3, -2, -1" may be extended by appending zero, then one, and so forth; is perfectly valid.

Both arguments were adopted by later Christian philosophers and theologians, and the second argument in particular became more famous after it was adopted by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his thesis of the first [[antinomy]] concerning time.{{sfn|Craig|1979}}
&lt;!-- End of text to merge with Eternity of the World --&gt;

==Modern revival==

[[Immanuel Kant]]'s argument for temporal finitism, at least in one direction, from his First Antinomy, runs as follows:{{sfn|Viney|1985|pp=65-68}}{{sfn|Smith|1929|loc=A 426}}

{{quote|If we assume that the world has no beginning in time, then up to every given moment an eternity has elapsed, and there has passed away in that world an infinite series of successive states of things. Now the infinity of a series consists in the fact that it can never be completed through successive synthesis. It thus follows that it is impossible for an infinite world-series to have passed away, and that a beginning of the world is therefore a necessary condition of the world's existence.|Immanuel Kant|First Antinomy, of Space and Time}}

Modern mathematics generally incorporates infinity. For most purposes it is simply used as convenient; when considered more carefully it is incorporated, or not, according to whether the [[axiom of infinity]] is included. This is the mathematical concept of infinity; while this may provide useful analogies or ways of thinking about the physical world, it says nothing directly about the physical world. [[Georg Cantor]] recognized two different kinds of infinity. The first, used in calculus, he called the variable finite, or potential infinite, represented by the &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; sign (known as the [[lemniscate]]), and the [[actual infinite]], which Cantor called the "true infinite." His notion of [[transfinite arithmetic]] became the standard system for working with [[infinity]] within [[set theory]]. [[David Hilbert]] thought that the role of the actual infinite was relegated only to the abstract realm of mathematics. "The infinite is nowhere to be found in reality. It neither exists in nature nor provides a legitimate basis for rational thought... The role that remain for the infinite to play is solely that of an idea."{{sfn|Benacerraf|Putnam|1991|p=151}} Philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] argues that if the past were infinitely long, it would entail the existence of actual infinites in reality.{{sfn|Craig|Sinclair|2009|p=115}}

Craig and Sinclair also argue that an actual infinite cannot be formed by successive addition. Quite independent of the absurdities arising from an actual infinite number of past events, the formation of an actual infinite has its own problems. For any [[Finite number (disambiguation)|finite]]{{dn|date=November 2016}} number n, n+1 equals a finite number. An actual infinity has no immediate predecessor.{{sfn|Craig|Sinclair|2009|p=117}}

The Tristram Shandy paradox is an attempt to illustrate the absurdity of an infinite past. Imagine Tristram Shandy, an immortal man who writes his biography so slowly that for every day that he lives, it takes him a year to record that day. Suppose that Shandy had always existed. Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between the number of past days and the number of past years on an infinite past, one could reason that Shandy could write his entire autobiography.{{sfn|Russell|1937|p=358}} From another perspective, Shandy would only get farther and farther behind, and given a past eternity, would be infinitely far behind.{{sfn|Craig|Sinclair|2009|p=121}}

Craig asks us to suppose that we met a man who claims to have been counting down from infinity and is now just finishing. We could ask why he did not finish counting yesterday or the day before, since eternity would have been over by then. In fact for any day in the past, if the man would have finished his countdown by day n, he would have finished his countdown by n-1. It follows that the man could not have finished his countdown at any point in the finite past, since he would have already been done.{{sfn|Craig|Sinclair|2009|p=122}}

==Input from physicists==
In 1984 physicist [[P.C.W. Davies|Paul Davies]] deduced a finite-time origin of the universe in a quite different way, from physical grounds: "the universe will eventually die, wallowing, as it were, in its own [[entropy]]. This is known among physicists as the 'heat death' of the universe... The universe cannot have existed for ever, otherwise it would have reached its equilibrium end state an infinite time ago. Conclusion: the universe did not always exist."{{sfn|Davies|1984|p=11}}

More recently though physicists have proposed various ideas for how the universe could have existed for an infinite time, such as [[eternal inflation]]. But in 2012, [[Alexander Vilenkin]] and [[Audrey Mithani]] of [[Tufts University]] wrote a paper claiming that in any such scenario past time could not have been infinite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Audrey Mithani and Alexander Vilenkin |title=Did the universe have a beginning? |url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4658 |website=arXiv.org |date=Apr 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It could however have been "before any nameable time", according to [[Leonard Susskind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marcus Chown |title=Before the big bang: something or nothing |journal=New Scientist |date=Dec 1, 2012 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21628932-000-before-the-big-bang-something-or-nothing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

Kant's argument for finitism has been widely discussed, for instance [[Jonathan Bennett (philosopher)|Jonathan Bennett]]{{sfn|Bennett|1971}} points out that Kant's argument is not a sound logical proof: His assertion that "Now the infinity of a series consists in the fact that it can never be completed through successive synthesis. It thus follows that it is impossible for an infinite world-series to have passed away", assumes that the universe was created at a beginning and then progressed from there, which seems to assume the conclusion. A universe that simply existed and had not been created, or a universe that was created as an infinite progression, for instance, would still be possible. Bennett quotes Strawson:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A temporal process both completed and infinite in duration appears to be impossible only on the assumption that it has a beginning. If ... it is urged that we cannot conceive of a process of surveying which does not have a beginning, then we must inquire with what relevance and by what right the notion of surveying is introduced into the discussion at all."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the criticism of William Lane Craig's argument for temporal finitism has been discussed and expanded on by Stephen Puryear.{{sfn|Puryear|2014}}&lt;ref&gt;www4.ncsu.edu/~smpuryea/papers/FinitismBeginningUniverse.pdf FINITISM AND THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE -- Preprint&lt;/ref&gt;

In this, he writes Craig's argument as:

# If the universe did not have a beginning, then the past would consist in an infinite temporal sequence of events.
# An infinite temporal sequence of past events would be actually and not merely potentially infinite.
# It is impossible for a sequence formed by successive addition to be actually infinite.
# The temporal sequence of past events was formed by successive addition.
# Therefore, the universe had a beginning.

Puryear points out that Aristotle and Aquinas had an opposing view to point 2, but that the most contentious is point 3. Puryear says that many philosophers have disagreed with point 3, and adds his own objection:
:"Consider the fact that things move from one point in space to another. In so doing, the moving object passes through an actual infinity of intervening points. Hence, motion involves traversing an actual infinite ... Accordingly, the finitist of this stripe must be mistaken. Similarly, whenever some period of time elapses, an actual infinite has been traversed, namely, the actual infinity of instants that make up that period of time."

Puryear then points that Craig has defended his position by saying that time might or must be naturally divided and so there is not an actual infinity of instants between two times. Puryear then goes on to argue that if Craig is willing to turn an infinity of points into a finite number of divisions, then points 1, 2 and 4 are not true.

An article by Louis J. Swingrover makes a number of points relating to the idea that Craig's "absurdities" are not contradictions in themselves: they are all either mathematically consistent (like Hilbert's hotel or the man counting down to today), or do not lead to inescapable conclusions. He argues that if one makes the assumption that any mathematically coherent model is metaphysically possible, then it can be shown that an infinite temporal chain is metaphysically possible, since one can show that there exist mathematically coherent models of an infinite progression of times. He also says that Craig might be making a cardinality error similar to assuming that because an infinitely extended temporal series would contain an infinite number of times, then it would have to contain the number "infinity".

Quentin Smith{{sfn|Smith|1987}} attacks "their supposition that an infinite series of past events must contain some events separated from the present event by an infinite number of intermediate events, and consequently that from one of these infinitely distant past events the present could never have been reached".

Smith asserts that Craig and Wiltrow are making a cardinality error by confusing an unending sequence with a sequence whose members must be separated by an infinity: None of the integers is separated from any other integer by an infinite number of integers, so why assert that an infinite series of times must contain a time infinitely far back in the past.

Smith then says that Craig uses false presuppositions when he makes statements about infinite collections (in particular the ones relating to Hilbert's Hotel and infinite sets being equivalent to proper subsets of them), often based on Craig finding things "unbelievable", when they are actually mathematically correct. He also points out that the Tristram Shandy paradox is mathematically coherent, but some of Craig's conclusions about when the biography would be finished are incorrect.

Ellery Eells{{sfn|Eells|1988}} expands on this last point by showing that the Tristram Shandy paradox is internally consistent and fully compatible with an infinite universe.

Graham Oppy{{sfn|Oppy|2003}} embroiled in debate with Oderberg, points out that the Tristram Shandy story has been used in many versions. For it to be useful to the temporal finitism side, a version must be found that is logically consistent and not compatible with an infinite universe. To see this, note that the argument runs as follows:
# If an infinite past is possible, then the Tristram Shandy story must be possible
# The Tristram Shandy story leads to contradiction.
# Therefore, an infinite past is not possible.

The problem for the finitist is that point 1 is not necessarily true. If a version of the Tristram Shandy story is internally inconsistent, for instance, then the infinitist could just assert that an infinite past is possible, but that particular Tristram Shandy is not because it's not internally consistent. Oppy then lists the different versions of the Tristram Shandy story that have been put forward and shows that they are all either internally inconsistent or they don't lead to contradiction.

[[File:Decalogue parchment by Jekuthiel Sofer 1768.jpg|right|thumb|alt=This is an image of a copy of the 1675 Ten Commandments, at the Amsterdam Esnoga synagogue, produced on parchment in 1768 by [[Jekuthiel Sofer]], a prolific Jewish eighteenth century scribe in Amsterdam. It has Hebrew language writing in two columns separated between, and surrounded by, ornate flowery patterns.|This 1768 [[parchment]] (612×502 mm) by [[Jekuthiel Sofer]] emulated the 1675 Ten Commandments at the [[Amsterdam Esnoga]] [[synagogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UBA: Rosenthaliana 1768|url=http://cf.uba.uva.nl/nl/publicaties/treasures/page/p34.html|accessdate=26 April 2012|trans-title={{lang-en|1768: The Ten Commandments, copied in Amsterdam Jekuthiel Sofer}}|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Ten Commandments''' ({{lang-he-n|עֲשֶׂרֶת הַדִּבְּרוֹת}}, ''Aseret ha'Dibrot''), also known as the '''Decalogue''', are a set of [[biblical]] principles relating to [[ethics]] and [[worship]], which play a fundamental role in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]. The commandments include instructions to [[Thou shalt have no other gods before me|worship only God]], to [[Honour thy father and thy mother|honour one's parents]], and to [[remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy|keep the sabbath]], as well as prohibitions against [[Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image|idolatry]], [[Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain|blasphemy]], [[Thou shalt not kill|murder]], [[Thou shalt not commit adultery|adultery]], [[Thou shalt not steal|theft]], [[Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour|dishonesty]], and [[Thou shalt not covet|coveting]]. Different religious groups follow different traditions for interpreting and numbering them.

The Ten Commandments appear twice in the Hebrew Bible, in the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and [[Deuteronomy]]. Modern scholarship has found likely influences in [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Mesopotamian]] laws and treaties, but is divided over exactly when the Ten Commandments were written and who wrote them.

In [[biblical Hebrew]], the Ten Commandments are called {{Hebrew|עשרת הדברים}} ([[Romanization of Hebrew|transliterated]] {{lang|he-Latn|aseret ha-d'varîm}}) and in [[Mishnaic Hebrew language|Mishnaic Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|עשרת הדברות}} (transliterated {{lang|he-Latn|aseret ha-dibrot}}), both translatable as "the ten words", "the ten sayings", or "the ten matters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1WUzUAdWRVUC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Ten Commandments: Ethics for the Twenty-First Century|first=Mark|last=Rooker|year=2010|publisher=B&amp;H Publishing Group|location=Nashville, Tennessee|page=3|isbn=0-8054-4716-4|accessdate=2011-10-02|quote=The Ten Commandments are literally the 'Ten Words' (''ăśeret hadděbārîm'') in Hebrew. The use of the term ''dābār'', 'word,' in this phrase distinguishes these laws from the rest of the commandments (''mişwâ''), statutes (''hōq''), and regulations (''mišpāţ'') in the Old Testament.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tyndale Bible|Tyndale]] and [[Coverdale Bible|Coverdale]] English biblical translations used "ten verses". The [[Geneva Bible]] used "tenne commandements", which was followed by the [[Bishops' Bible]] and the [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized Version]] (the "King James" version) as "ten commandments". Most major English versions use "commandments."&lt;ref name="ex34-28"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studybible.info/compare/Exodus%2034:28 |title=Exodus 34:28 – multiple versions and languages |publisher=Studybible.info |date= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English name "Decalogue" is derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|δεκάλογος}}, ''dekalogos'', the latter meaning and referring&lt;ref name="LSJ_Dekalogos"&gt;{{LSJ|deka/logos|δεκάλογος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] translation (in [[Accusative case|accusative]]) {{lang|grc|δέκα λόγους}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|deka logous}}, "ten words", found in the [[Septuagint]] (or LXX) at [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 34:28&lt;ref name="ex34-28" /&gt; and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 5:6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studybible.info/compare/Deuteronomy%2010:4 |title=Deuteronomy 10:4 – multiple versions and languages |publisher=Studybible.info |date= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone tablets, as opposed to the commandments inscribed on them, are called {{Hebrew|לוחות הברית}}, ''Lukhot HaBrit'', meaning "the tablets of the [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]]".

Different religious traditions divide the seventeen verses of {{bibleverse||Exodus|20:1–17|HE}} and their parallels at {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|5:4–21|HE}} into ten "commandments" or "sayings" in different ways, shown in the table below. Some suggest that the number ten is a choice to aid memorization rather than a matter of theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ten Commandments and the Beatitudes |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |last=Chan |first=Yiu Sing Lúcás |year=2012 |location=Lantham, MA |pages=38, 241 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ITxsMU-7sIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Block /&gt;

You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the {{Lord}} your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.

* All scripture quotes above are from the [[King James Version]] unless otherwise stated. Click on verses at top of columns for other versions.

Traditions:
* '''LXX''': [[Septuagint]], generally followed by Orthodox Christians.
* '''P''': [[Philo]], same as the Septuagint, but with the prohibitions on killing and adultery reversed.
* '''S''': [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], with an additional commandment about [[Mount Gerizim]] as 10th.
* '''T''': Jewish [[Talmud]], makes the "prologue" the first "saying" or "matter" and combines the prohibition on worshiping deities other than Yahweh with the prohibition on idolatry.
* '''A''': [[Augustine]] follows the Talmud in combining verses 3–6, but omits the prologue as a commandment and divides the prohibition on coveting in two and following the word order of Deuteronomy 5:21 rather than Exodus 20:17.
* '''C''': ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', largely follows Augustine.
* '''L''': [[Lutherans]] follow [[Luther's Large Catechism]], which follows Augustine but subordinates the prohibition of images to the sovereignty of God in the First Commandment&lt;ref name="LC" /&gt; and uses the word order of Exodus 20:17 rather than Deuteronomy 5:21 for the ninth and tenth commandments.
* '''R''': [[Reformed Christian]]s follow [[John Calvin]]'s ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'', which follows the Septuagint; this system is also used in the [[Anglican]] ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fincham |first1=Kenneth |last2=Lake |first2=Peter (editors) |date=2006 |title=Religious Politics in Post-reformation England |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ozTiFBvdDTIC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=ten+commandments+anglican+numbering&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS37q2u-fQAhUMAcAKHeuQBtMQ6AEIRTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=ten%20commandments%20anglican%20numbering&amp;f=false |location=Woodbridge, Suffolk |publisher=The Boydell Press |page=42 |isbn=1-84383-253-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The biblical narrative of the revelation at Sinai begins in {{Bibleref|Exodus|19|HE}} after the arrival of the children of Israel at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] (also called [[Mount Horeb|Horeb]]). On the morning of the third day of their encampment, "there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud", and the people assembled at the base of the mount. After "the {{LORD}}&lt;ref&gt;When {{LORD}} is printed in small caps, it typically represents the so-called ''[[Tetragrammaton]]'', a Greek term representing the four Hebrews YHWH which indicates the divine name. This is typically indicated in the preface of most modern translations. For an example, see {{citation|author=Crossway Bibles|title=Holy Bible: English Standard Version|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co2PZwEACAAJ|accessdate=19 November 2012|date=28 December 2011|publisher=Crossway|location=Wheaton|isbn=978-1-4335-3087-6|page=IX|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; came down upon mount Sinai", [[Moses]] went up briefly and returned and prepared the people, and then in {{Bibleref|Exodus|20|HE}} "God spoke" to all the people the words of the covenant, that is, the "ten commandments"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy.4:13;5:22||9|Deuteronomy 4:13, 5:22}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is written.  Modern biblical scholarship differs as to whether {{Bibleref|Exodus|19-20|HE}} describes the people of Israel as having directly heard all or some of the decalogue, or whether the laws are only passed to them through Moses.&lt;ref&gt;Somer, Benjamin D. ''Revelation and Authority: Sinai in Jewish Scripture and Tradition'' (The Anchor Yale Bible Reference Library). pg = 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The people were afraid to hear more and moved "afar off", and Moses responded with "Fear not." Nevertheless, he drew near the "thick darkness" where "the presence of the Lord" was&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|20:21|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; to hear the additional statutes and "judgments",&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|21–23|9|Exodus 21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; all which he "wrote"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|24:4|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the "[[Covenant code|book of the covenant]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|24:7|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he read to the people the next morning, and they agreed to be obedient and do all that the {{LORD}} had said. Moses escorted a select group consisting of [[Aaron]], [[Nadab and Abihu]], and "seventy of the elders of Israel" to a location on the mount where they worshipped "afar off"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|24:1,9|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they "saw the God of Israel" above a "paved work" like clear sapphire stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|24:1–11|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|1=And the {{LORD}} said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tablets of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.|2=First mention of the tablets in {{bibleref2|Exodus|24:12–13}}}}

[[File:Rembrandt - Moses with the Ten Commandments - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=This is an image of an oil on canvas picture by Rembrandt (1659) of a bearded man representing Moses with two tablets of stone of the ten commandments held high in both hands.|''[[Moses Breaking the Tablets of the Law]]'' (1659) by Rembrandt. ([[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]])]]

The mount was covered by the cloud for six days, and on the seventh day Moses went into the midst of the cloud and was "in the mount [[forty days and forty nights]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|24:16–18|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Moses said, "the {{LORD}} delivered unto me two tablets of stone written with the [[finger of God]]; and on them was written according to all the words, which the {{LORD}} spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|9:10|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the full forty days expired, the children of Israel collectively decided that something had happened to Moses, and compelled Aaron to fashion a [[golden calf]], and he "built an altar before it"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|32:1–5|9|Ex. 32:1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the people "worshipped" the calf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|32:6–8|9|Ex. 32:6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the full forty days, Moses and Joshua came down from the mountain with the [[Tablets of Stone|tablets of stone]]: "And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tablets out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|32:19|9|Ex.32:19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the events in chapters 32 and 33, the {{LORD}} told Moses, "Hew thee two tablets of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tablets the words that were in the first tablets, which thou brakest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|34:1|9|Ex. 34:1}}&lt;/ref&gt; "And he wrote on the tablets, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the {{LORD}} spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the {{LORD}} gave them unto me."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|10:4|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jewish tradition, {{Bibleref2|Exodus|20:1–17|9|Exodus 20:1–17}} constitutes God's first recitation and inscription of the ten commandments on the two tablets,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Exodus.20:1;Exodus.32:15–19||9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Moses broke in anger with his rebellious nation, and were later rewritten on replacement stones and placed in the [[ark of the covenant]];&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Deuteronomy.4:10–13;Deut.5:22;Deut.9:17;Deut.10:1–5||9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|5:4–25|9|Deuteronomy 5:4–25}} consists of God's re-telling of the Ten Commandments to the younger generation who were to enter the Promised Land. The passages in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 contain more than ten imperative statements, totalling 14 or 15 in all.

==Religious interpretations==
The Ten Commandments concern matters of fundamental importance in Judaism and Christianity: the greatest obligation (to worship only God), the greatest injury to a person (murder), the greatest injury to family bonds (adultery), the greatest injury to commerce and law (bearing false witness), the greatest inter-generational obligation (honour to parents), the greatest obligation to community (truthfulness), the greatest injury to moveable property (theft).&lt;ref name=Huffmon&gt;Herbert Huffmon, "The Fundamental Code Illustrated: The Third Commandment," in ''The Ten Commandments: The Reciprocity of Faithfulness'', ed. William P. Brown., [https://books.google.com/books?id=87hQ2AjcttEC&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;pg=PA205 pp. 205–212]. Westminster John Knox Press (2004). {{ISBN|0-664-22323-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ten Commandments are written with room for varying interpretation, reflecting their role as a summary of fundamental principles.&lt;ref name=Block/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huffmon/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Milgrom/&gt; They are not as explicit&lt;ref name=Huffmon /&gt; or detailed as rules&lt;ref name=Barclay&gt;[[William Barclay (theologian)|William Barclay]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=jlwiXdFnaQEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA5 ''The Ten Commandments.''] Westminster John Knox Press (2001), originally ''The Plain Man's Guide to Ethics'' (1973). {{ISBN|0-664-22346-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; or many other biblical laws and commandments, because they provide guiding principles that apply universally, across changing circumstances. They do not specify punishments for their violation. Their precise import must be worked out in each separate situation.&lt;ref name=Barclay /&gt;

The Bible indicates the special status of the Ten Commandments among all other [[Torah]] laws in several ways:
*They have a uniquely terse style.&lt;ref name=ODay/&gt;
*Of all the biblical laws and commandments, the Ten Commandments alone&lt;ref name=ODay&gt;Gail R. O'Day and David L. Petersen, ''Theological Bible Commentary'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=rQWknj4ORJkC&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q=%22finger%20of%20God%22&amp;f=false p. 34], Westminster John Knox Press (2009) {{ISBN|0-664-22711-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; are said to have been "written with the finger of God" ({{bibleref2|Exodus|31:18}}). &lt;!--- The source provides one more item, which should go here. !---&gt;
*The stone tablets were placed in the [[Ark of the Covenant]] ({{bibleref2|Exodus|25:21}}, {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|10:2,5}}).&lt;ref name=ODay/&gt;

===Judaism===
&lt;!-- Judaism footer, instead of overly large sidebar --&gt;
The Ten Commandments form the basis of Jewish law,&lt;ref name=solomon&gt;Norman Solomon, ''Judaism'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=zmPiTksnUE8C&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q=%22basis%20of%20Jewish%20law%22&amp;f=false p. 17]. Sterling Publishing Company (2009) {{ISBN|1-4027-6884-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating God's universal and timeless standard of right and wrong – unlike the rest of the [[613 commandments]] in the Torah, which include, for example, various duties and ceremonies such as the [[kashrut]] dietary laws, and now unobservable rituals to be performed by priests in the [[Holy Temple]].&lt;ref name=dosick&gt;Wayne D. Dosick, ''Living Judaism: The Complete Guide to Jewish Belief, Tradition, and Practice'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=bpXUYUO7cg8C&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;pg=PA31#v=snippet&amp;q=%22ten%20commandments%22&amp;f=false pp. 31–33]. HarperCollins (1995). {{ISBN|0-06-062179-6}} "There are 603 more Torah commandments. But in giving these ten — with their wise insight into the human condition — God established a standard of right and wrong, a powerful code of behavior, that is universal and timeless."&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish tradition considers the Ten Commandments the theological basis for the rest of the commandments; a number of works, starting with Rabbi [[Saadia Gaon]], have made groupings of the commandments according to their links with the Ten Commandments.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

A [[Conservative Judaism|conservative]] rabbi, [[Louis Ginzberg]], stated in his book ''[[Legends of the Jews]]'', that Ten Commandments are virtually entwined, that the breaking of one leads to the breaking of another. Echoing an earlier rabbinic comment found in the commentary of Rashi to the Songs of Songs (4:5) Ginzberg explained—there is also a great bond of union between the first five commandments and the last five. The first commandment: "I am the Lord, thy God," corresponds to the sixth: "Thou shalt not kill," for the murderer slays the image of God. The second: "Thou shalt have no strange gods before me," corresponds to the seventh: "Thou shalt not commit adultery," for conjugal faithlessness is as grave a sin as idolatry, which is faithlessness to God. The third commandment: "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain," corresponds to the eighth: "Thou shalt not steal," for stealing result in false oath in God's name. The fourth: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy," corresponds to the ninth: "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor," for he who bears false witness against his neighbor commits as grave a sin as if he had borne false witness against God, saying that He had not created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day (the holy Sabbath). The fifth commandment: "Honor thy father and thy mother," corresponds to the tenth: "Covet not thy neighbor's wife," for one who indulges this lust produces children who will not honor their true father, but will consider a stranger their father.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis, [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS ''The Legends of the Jews'', Vol. III: The Unity of Ten Commandments], (Translated by Henrietta Szold), Johns Hopkins University Press: 1998, {{ISBN|0-8018-5890-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional Rabbinical Jewish belief is that the observance of these commandments and the other ''mitzvot'' are required solely of the Jewish people and that the laws incumbent on humanity in general are outlined in the seven [[Noahide laws]], several of which overlap with the Ten Commandments. In the era of the [[Sanhedrin]] transgressing any one of six of the Ten Commandments theoretically carried the [[death penalty]], the exceptions being the First Commandment, honouring your father and mother, saying God's name in vain, and coveting, though this was rarely enforced due to a large number of stringent evidentiary requirements imposed by the [[oral law]].&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Makkos 1:10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Two tablets====
{{Main|Tablets of Stone}}
The arrangement of the commandments on the two tablets is interpreted in different ways in the classical Jewish tradition. Rabbi Hanina ben Gamaliel says that each tablet contained five commandments, "but the Sages say ten on one tablet and ten on the other", that is, that the tablets were duplicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta]] |author=Rabbi Ishmael |editor=Horowitz-Rabin |pages=233, Tractate ''de-ba-Hodesh'', 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be compared to diplomatic treaties of the ancient Near East, in which a copy was made for each party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What was Written on the Two Tablets? |url=http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/kitisa/mar.html |last=Margaliot |first=Dr. Meshulam |date=July 2004 |publisher=Bar-Ilan University |accessdate=2006-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Talmud]], the compendium of traditional [[Rabbinic Jewish]] law, tradition, and interpretation, one interpretation of the biblical verse "the tablets were written on both their sides",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Exodus||32:15|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that the carving went through the full thickness of the tablets, yet was miraculously legible from both sides.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]]'', tractate [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 104a.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use in Jewish ritual====
[[File:5493 - Venezia - Ghetto Nuovo - Negozio ebraico - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 1-Aug-2008.jpg|thumb|The Ten Commandments on a glass plate]]
The [[Mishna]] records that during the period of the [[Second Temple]], the Ten Commandments were recited daily,&lt;ref name=Glustrom /&gt; before the reading of the [[Shema Yisrael]] (as preserved, for example, in the [[Nash Papyrus]], a Hebrew manuscript fragment from 150–100 BCE found in Egypt, containing a version of the ten commandments and the beginning of the Shema); but that this practice was abolished in the synagogues so as not to give ammunition to heretics who claimed that they were the only important part of Jewish law,&lt;ref&gt;Yerushalmi Berakhot, Chapter 1, fol. 3c. See also Rabbi David Golinkin, [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Shavuot/In_the_Community/Torah_Reading_and_Haftarah/The_Ten_Commandments/In_Liturgy.shtml Whatever Happened to the Ten Commandments?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Talmud''. tractate [https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.12a Berachot 12a.]&lt;/ref&gt; or to dispute a claim by early Christians that ''only'' the Ten Commandments were handed down at Mount Sinai rather than the whole Torah.&lt;ref name=Glustrom /&gt;

In later centuries rabbis continued to omit the Ten Commandments from daily liturgy in order to prevent a confusion among Jews that they are ''only'' bound by the Ten Commandments, and not also by many other biblical and Talmudic laws, such as the requirement to observe holy days other than the sabbath.&lt;ref name=Glustrom /&gt;

Today, the Ten Commandments are heard in the synagogue three times a year: as they come up during the readings of Exodus and Deuteronomy, and during the festival of [[Shavuot]].&lt;ref name=Glustrom /&gt; The Exodus version is read in ''[[parasha]]t [[Yitro]]'' around late January–February, and on the festival of Shavuot, and the Deuteronomy version in ''parashat [[Va'etchanan]]'' in August–September. In some traditions, worshipers rise for the reading of the Ten Commandments to highlight their special significance&lt;ref name=Glustrom&gt;Simon Glustrom, ''The Myth and Reality of Judaism'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=y8nR8e7FzY0C&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp 113–114]. Behrman House (1989). {{ISBN|0-87441-479-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though many rabbis, including [[Maimonides]], have opposed this custom since one may come to think that the Ten Commandments are more important than the rest of the [[Mitzvot]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldweb.chiefrabbi.org/ReadArtical.aspx?id=1872 Covenant &amp; Conversation Yitro 5772] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524100757/http://oldweb.chiefrabbi.org/ReadArtical.aspx?id=1872 |date=24 May 2015 }} Chief Rabbi. Retrieved 24 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In printed [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumashim]], as well as in those in manuscript form, the Ten Commandments carry two sets of [[cantillation]] marks. The ''ta'am 'elyon'' (upper accentuation), which makes each Commandment into a separate verse, is used for public Torah reading, while the ''ta'am tachton'' (lower accentuation), which divides the text into verses of more even length, is used for private reading or study. The verse numbering in Jewish Bibles follows the ''ta'am tachton''. In Jewish Bibles the references to the Ten Commandments are therefore {{bibleverse|Exodus||20:2–14|JP}} and {{bibleverse|Deuteronomy||5:6–18|JP}}.

===Samaritan===
The [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] varies in the Ten Commandments passages, both in that the Samaritan Deuteronomical version of the passage is much closer to that in Exodus, and in that Samaritans count as nine commandments what others count as ten. The Samaritan tenth commandment is on the sanctity of [[Mount Gerizim]].

The text of the Samaritan tenth commandment follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Samaritan Tenth Commandment |url=http://shomron0.tripod.com/update12.19.2002o.html|last=Gaster |first=Moses |work=The Samaritans, Their History, Doctrines and Literature |publisher=The [[Schweich Lectures]] |year=1923 |authorlink=Moses Gaster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====References in the New Testament====
{{See also|Matthew 5#Antitheses}}
[[File:Moses and Aaron with the 10 Commandments 1674.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Moses and Aaron with the Ten Commandments'' (painting circa 1675 by Aron de Chavez)]]
During his [[Sermon on the Mount]], Jesus explicitly referenced the prohibitions against murder and adultery. In {{bibleref2|Matthew|19:16-19}} [[Jesus]] repeated five of the Ten Commandments, followed by that commandment called "the second" ({{bibleref2|Matthew|22:34-40}}) after the [[Great Commandment|first and great commandment]].

{{Quote|And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? ''there is'' none good but one, ''that is'', God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and ''thy'' mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.|{{bibleref2|Matthew|19:16-19|KJV}}}}

In his [[Epistle to the Romans]], [[Paul the Apostle]] also mentioned five of the Ten Commandments and associated them with the neighbourly love commandment.

{{Quote|1=&lt;poem&gt;Romans 13:8 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if ''there be'' any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
10 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love ''is'' the fulfilling of the law.&lt;/poem&gt;|2={{bibleref|Romans|13:8-10|9}} KJV}}

====Roman Catholicism====
{{Main|Ten Commandments in Catholic theology}}

In Roman Catholicism, Jesus freed Christians from the rest of [[Halakha|Jewish religious law]], but not from their obligation to keep the Ten Commandments.&lt;ref name=Kreeft&gt;Jan Kreeft, ''Catholic Christianity: A Complete Catechism of Catholic Beliefs Based on the Catechism of the Catholic Church'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ-xgfJkNNgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA202#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ch. 5].

According to the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]''—the official exposition of the [[Catholic Church]]'s Christian beliefs—the Commandments are considered essential for spiritual good health and growth,&lt;ref name="Kreeft201"&gt;{{cite book |title=Catholic Christianity |last=Kreeft |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Kreeft|year=2001 |publisher=Ignatius Press |isbn=0-89870-798-6}} pp. 201–203 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ-xgfJkNNgC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google preview p.201])&lt;/ref&gt; and serve as the basis for [[Catholic social teaching|social justice]].&lt;ref name="Carmody"&gt;{{cite book |title=Reading the Bible |last=Carmody |first=Timothy R. |year=2004 |publisher=[[Paulist Press]]|isbn=978-0-8091-4189-0}} p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Church teaching of the Commandments is largely based on the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s and the writings of the early [[Church Fathers]].&lt;ref name="Cat"&gt;{{cite web |last =Paragraph number 2052–2074 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|year=1994|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2.htm |accessdate=8 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament, Jesus [[Sermon on the Mount|acknowledged their validity]] and instructed his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] to go further, demanding a righteousness exceeding that of the [[scribes]] and [[Pharisees]].&lt;ref name="Kreeft202"&gt;{{cite book |title=Catholic Christianity |last=Kreeft |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Kreeft|year=2001 |publisher=Ignatius Press |isbn=0-89870-798-6}} p. 202 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ-xgfJkNNgC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google preview p.202])&lt;/ref&gt; Summarized by Jesus into two "[[Great Commandment|great commandments]]" that teach the love of God and love of neighbour,&lt;ref name="Schreck303"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Essential Catholic Catechism |last=Schreck |first=Alan|year=1999 |publisher=Servant Publications|isbn=1-56955-128-6}} p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; they instruct individuals on their relationships with both.

====Orthodox====
The Eastern Orthodox Church holds its moral truths to be chiefly contained in the Ten Commandments.&lt;ref name=Dabovich&gt;Sebastian Dabovich, ''Preaching in the Russian Church'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=RsJFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 65].

J. Parker and Co. (1899).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protestantism====
{{See also|Law and Gospel}}
After rejecting the Roman Catholic moral theology, giving [[Law and Gospel|more importance to biblical law]] and [[the gospel]], early Protestant theologians continued to take the Ten Commandments as the starting point of Christian moral life.&lt;ref name=Sedgwick&gt;[[Timothy Sedgwick]], ''The Christian Moral Life: Practices of Piety'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=HFVg2jBgL3IC&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 9–20]. Church Publishing (2008). {{ISBN|1-59627-100-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different versions of Christianity have varied in how they have translated the bare principles into the specifics that make up a full [[Christian ethic]].&lt;ref name=Sedgwick /&gt; 
[[File:Ten Commandments in India.jpg|right|thumb|A Christian school in India displays the Ten Commandments]]

=====Lutheranism=====
The Lutheran division of the commandments follows the one established by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], following the then current synagogue scribal division. The first three commandments govern the relationship between God and humans, the fourth through eighth govern public relationships between people, and the last two govern private thoughts. See Luther's Small Catechism&lt;ref&gt;[http://bookofconcord.org/smallcatechism.php#tencommandments Luther's Small Catechism] (1529)&lt;/ref&gt; and Large Catechism.&lt;ref name="LC"&gt;[http://bookofconcord.org/lc-3-tencommandments.php Luther's Large Catechism] (1529)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Reformed=====
The ''[[Thirty-nine Articles|Articles of the Church of England]], Revised and altered by the [[Westminster Assembly|Assembly of Divines, at Westminster]], in the year 1643'' state that "no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the commandments which are called moral. By the moral law, we understand all the Ten Commandments taken in their full extent."&lt;ref name="Neal1843"&gt;{{cite book|last=Neal|first=Daniel|title=The History of the Puritans, Or Protestant Non-conformists|year=1843|publisher=Harper|language=English|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Westminster Confession]], held by [[Presbyterian Church]]es, holds that the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments "does forever bind all, as well justified persons as others, to the obedience thereof".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/index.html?body=/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_XIX.html|title=Westminster Confession of Faith: Chapter XIX - Of the Law of God|language=English|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Methodist=====
The moral law contained in the Ten Commandments, according to the founder of the [[Methodist]] movement [[John Wesley]], was instituted from the beginning of the world and is written on the hearts of all people.&lt;ref name="Rodes2014"/&gt; 
As with the Reformed view,&lt;ref name="Campbell2011"/&gt; Wesley held that the moral law, which is contained in the Ten Commandments, stands today:&lt;ref name="Utter1913"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sabbath Recorder, Volume 75|year=1913|publisher=George B. Utter|language=English|page=422|quote=The moral law contained in the Ten Commandments and enforced by the prophets, he (Christ) did not take away. It was not the design of his coming to revoke any part of this. This is a law which never can be broken. It stands fast as the faithful witness in heaven.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Every part of this law must remain in force upon all mankind in all ages, as not depending either on time or place, nor on any other circumstances liable to change; but on the nature of God and the nature of man, and their unchangeable relation to each other" (Wesley's ''Sermons'', Vol. I, Sermon 25).&lt;ref name="Utter1913"/&gt;}}
In keeping with [[Wesleyan covenant theology]], "while the ceremonial law was abolished in Christ and the whole Mosaic dispensation itself was concluded upon the appearance of Christ, the moral law remains a vital component of the covenant of grace, having Christ as its perfecting end."&lt;ref name="Rodes2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodes|first=Stanley J.|title=From Faith to Faith: John Wesley’s Covenant Theology and the Way of Salvation|date=25 September 2014|publisher=James Clarke &amp; Co|language=English|isbn=9780227902202|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, in Methodism, an "important aspect of the pursuit of [[sanctification]] is the careful following" of the Ten Commandments.&lt;ref name="Campbell2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Ted A.|title=Methodist Doctrine: The Essentials, 2nd Edition|accessdate=|date=1 October 2011|publisher=Abingdon Press|language=English|isbn=9781426753473|pages=40, 68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Baptist=====
The Ten Commandments are a summary of the requirements of a works covenant (called the "Old Covenant"), given on Mount Sinai to the nascent nation of Israel. The Old Covenant came to an end at the cross and is therefore not in effect. They do reflect the eternal character of God, and serve as a paragon of morality. &lt;ref&gt;http://ids.org/wp-content/uploads/articles/israel.pdf, page 1, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
According to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS) doctrine, Jesus completed rather than rejected the Mosaic Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/2002/07/the-saviors-use-of-the-old-testament.p46 |title=The Savior's Use of the Old Testament |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |work=Ensign |accessdate=November 28, 2013 |author=Olmstead, Thomas F. |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ten Commandments are considered eternal gospel principles necessary for [[exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exaltation]].&lt;ref name=mormon /&gt; They appear in the [[Book of Mosiah]] 12:34–36,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url= https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/12.34-36?lang=eng#33%7CMosiah |title= Mosiah 12:34–36 |publisher=Lds.org |date= |accessdate= 2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 13:15–16,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url= https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/12.34-36?lang=eng#33%7CMosiah |title=Mosiah 13:15–16 |publisher= Lds.org |date= |accessdate= 2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 13:21–24&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url= https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/12.34-36?lang=eng#33%7CMosiah |title= Mosiah 13:20–24 |publisher= Lds.org |date= |accessdate= 2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Doctrine and Covenants]].&lt;ref name="mormon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/topics/ten-commandments |title=Ten Commandments |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |work=Gospel Library |accessdate=November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Book of Mosiah, a prophet named [[Abinadi]] taught the Ten Commandments in the court of [[King Noah]] and was martyred for his righteousness.&lt;ref name="encmorm"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Abinadi |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Mormonism |publisher=Macmillan |accessdate=November 28, 2013 |author=Cramer, Lew W. |editor=Ludlow, Daniel H. |year=1992 |location=New York |pages=5–7 |url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Abinadi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abinadi]] knew the Ten Commandments from the [[brass plates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldsces.org/manuals/book-of-mormon-institute-student-manual/bm1996-05-mos-5-3.asp Mosiah 13:11–26 :The Ten Commandments]: "Some may wonder how Abinadi could have read the Ten Commandments that God gave to Moses. It should be remembered that the brass plates Nephi obtained contained the five books of Moses ([http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/5.10-11?lang=eng Nephi 5:10–11]). This record, which would have contained the Ten Commandments, had been passed down by Nephite prophets and record keepers. The previous scriptures were known to King Noah and his priests because they quoted from Isaiah and referred to the law of Moses (see Mosiah 12:20–24, 28)."&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2010 address, LDS president and prophet [[Thomas S. Monson]] taught "The Ten Commandments are just that—commandments. They are not suggestions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas S.

===Main points of interpretative difference===

====Sabbath day====
{{See also|Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy|Shabbat|Judaizers}}
All Abrahamic religions observe a weekly day of rest, often called the Sabbath, although the actual day of the week ranges from Friday in Islam, Saturday in Judaism (both reckoned from dusk to dusk), and Sunday, from midnight to midnight, in Christianity. [[Sabbath in Christianity]] is a day of [[leisure|rest]] from work, often dedicated to religious observance, derived from the [[Biblical Sabbath]].&lt;ref&gt;({{lang-he-n|[[wikt:שַׁבָּת|שַׁבָּת]]}}, ''shabbâth'', {{StrongHebrew|7676}}, meaning intensive "repose").&lt;/ref&gt; [[Non-Sabbatarianism]] is the principle of [[Christian liberty]] from being bound to physical sabbath observance. Most dictionaries provide both first-day and seventh-day definitions for "sabbath" and "Sabbatarian", among other related uses.

Observing the Sabbath on Sunday, the day of resurrection, gradually became the dominant Christian practice from the [[Jewish-Roman wars]] onward.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The Church's general repudiation of Jewish practices during this period is apparent in the [[Council of Laodicea]] (4th century AD) where Canons 37–38 state: "It is not lawful to receive portions sent from the feasts of Jews or heretics, nor to feast together with them" and "It is not lawful to receive unleavened bread from the Jews, nor to be partakers of their impiety".&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3806.htm Synod of Laodicea (4th Century)] – New Advent&lt;/ref&gt; Canon 29 of the Laodicean council specifically refers to the sabbath: "Christians must not judaize by resting on the [Jewish] Sabbath, but must work on that day, rather honouring the Lord's Day; and, if they can, resting then as Christians. But if any shall be found to be judaizers, let them be anathema from Christ."&lt;ref name="newadvent.org" /&gt;

====Killing or murder====

Multiple translations exist of the fifth/sixth commandment; the Hebrew words {{Hebrew|לא תרצח}} (lo tirtzach) are variously translated as "thou shalt not kill" or "thou shalt not murder".&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/compare/Exodus%2020:13 Exodus 20:13] Multiple versions and languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

The imperative is against unlawful killing resulting in [[Bloodguilt in the Hebrew Bible|bloodguilt]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_03145.html Bloodguilt, Jewish Virtual Library], Genesis 4:10, Genesis 9:6, Genesis 42:22, Exodus 22:2–2, Leviticus 17:4, Leviticus 20, Numbers 20, Deuteronomy 19, Deuteronomy 32:43, Joshua 2:19, Judges 9:24, 1 Samuel 25, 2 Samuel 1, 2 Samuel 21, 1 Kings 2, 1 Kings 21:19, 2 Kings 24:4, Psalm 9:12, Psalm 51:14, Psalm 106:38, Proverbs 6:17, Isaiah 1:15, Isaiah 26:21, Jeremiah 22:17, Lamentations 4:13, Ezekiel 9:9, Ezekiel 36:18, Hosea 4:2, Joel 3:19, Habakkuk 2:8, Matthew 23:30–35, Matthew 27:4, Luke 11:50–51, Romans 3:15, Revelation 6:10, Revelation 18:24&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew Bible contains numerous prohibitions against unlawful killing, but does not prohibit killing in the context of [[warfare]] ({{bibleref2|1Kings|2:5-6|9|1Kings 2:5–6}}), [[capital punishment]] ({{bibleref2|Leviticus|20:9-16|9|Leviticus 20:9–16}}) and [[self-defence]] ({{bibleref2|Exodus|22:2–3|9|Exodus 22:2–3}}), which are considered justified.

====Theft====
{{Main|Thou shalt not steal}}
German Old Testament scholar [[Albrecht Alt]]: ''Das Verbot des Diebstahls im Dekalog'' (1953), suggested that the commandment translated as "thou shalt not steal" was originally intended against stealing people—against abductions and slavery, in agreement with the Talmudic interpretation of the statement as "thou shalt not kidnap" (Sanhedrin 86a).

====Idolatry====
{{Main|Idolatry|Idolatry in Judaism|Idolatry in Christianity}}
Idolatry is forbidden in all Abrahamic religions. In Judaism there is a prohibition against ''worshipping'' an idol or a representation of God, but there is no restriction on art or simple ''depictions''. Islam has a stronger prohibition, banning representations of God, and in some cases of Muhammad, humans and, in some interpretations, any living creature.

In [[Gospel of Barnabas]], Jesus stated that idolatry is the greatest sin as it divests a man fully of faith, and hence of God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnabas.net/index.php/chapters/424-chapter-32-statues-of-flesh Chapter 32: Statues of Flesh] ''Barnabas.net''&lt;/ref&gt; In his time, Idolatry is not only worshipping statues of wood or stone; but also statues of flesh. All which a man loves, for which he leaves everything else but that, is his god, thus the glutton and drunkard has for his idol his own flesh, the fornicator has for his idol the harlot and the greedy has for his idol silver and gold, and so the same for every other sinner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110826202022/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/arts/barnabas/Barncoloured.html Gospel of Barnabas chapter XXXIII] ''Latrobe Edu''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christianity's earliest centuries, some Christians had informally adorned their homes and places of worship with images of Christ and the saints, which others thought inappropriate. No church council had ruled on whether such practices constituted idolatry. The controversy reached crisis level in the 8th century, during the period of [[iconoclasm]]: the smashing of icons.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;

In 726 [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo III]] ordered all images removed from all churches; in 730 a council forbade veneration of images, citing the Second Commandment; in 787 the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] reversed the preceding rulings, condemning iconoclasm and sanctioning the veneration of images; in 815 [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] called yet another council, which reinstated iconoclasm; in 843 [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Empress Theodora]] again reinstated veneration of icons.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt; This mostly settled the matter until the [[Protestant Reformation]], when [[John Calvin]] declared that the ruling of the Seventh Ecumenical Council "emanated from Satan".&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt; Protestant iconoclasts at this time destroyed statues, pictures, stained glass, and artistic masterpieces.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates Theodora's restoration of the icons every year on the First Sunday of [[Great Lent]].&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt; Eastern Orthodox tradition teaches that while images of God, the Father, remain prohibited, depictions of Jesus as the incarnation of God as a visible human are permissible. To emphasize the theological importance of the incarnation, the Orthodox Church encourages the use of icons in church and private devotions, but prefers a two-dimensional depiction&lt;ref name=Hore&gt;Alexander Hugh Hore, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Oz68qcjV3MQC&amp;dq=%22orthodox%20church%22%20%22statues%22&amp;pg=PA353#v=onepage&amp;q=%22flat%20pictures%22&amp;f=false ''Eighteen Centuries of the Orthodox Church''], J. Parker and co. (1899)&lt;br /&gt;"The images or Icons, as they are called, of the Greek Church are not, it must be remarked, sculptured images, but flat pictures or mosaics; not even the Crucifix is sanctioned; and herein consists the difference between the Greek and Roman Churches, in the latter of which both pictures and statues are allowed, and venerated with equal honour." [https://books.google.com/books?id=Oz68qcjV3MQC&amp;dq=%22orthodox%20church%22%20%22statues%22&amp;pg=PA353#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.353]&lt;/ref&gt; as a reminder of this theological aspect. Icons depict the spiritual dimension of their subject rather than attempting a naturalistic portrayal.&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;Archpriest John W.

AuthorHouse (2011) {{ISBN|1-4567-3492-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern use (usually as a result of Roman Catholic influence), more naturalistic images and images of the Father, however, also appear occasionally in Orthodox churches, but statues, i.e. three-dimensional depictions, continue to be banned.&lt;ref name=Hore /&gt;

====Adultery====
Originally this commandment forbade male Israelites from having sexual intercourse with the wife of another Israelite; the prohibition did not extend to their own slaves. Sexual intercourse between an Israelite man, married or not, and a woman who was neither married nor [[Engagement|betrothed]] was not considered adultery.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, R. F. (1992). "Ten Commandments." In D. N. Freedman (Ed.), ''The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary'' (Vol. 6, p. 386). New York: Doubleday&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of adultery stems from the economic aspect of Israelite marriage whereby the husband has an exclusive right to his wife, whereas the wife, as the husband's possession, did not have an exclusive right to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/adultery.html |title='&amp;#39;Encyclopedia Judaica'&amp;#39; vol01 pg 424 |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Ginzberg argued that the tenth commandment (''Covet not thy neighbor's wife'') is directed against a sin which may lead to a trespassing of all Ten Commandments.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis, [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20OTHER%20COMMANDMENTS%20REVEALED%20ON%20SINAI ''The Legends of the Jews'', Vol. III: The other Commandments Revealed on Sinai], (Translated by Henrietta Szold), Johns Hopkins University Press: 1998, {{ISBN|0-8018-5890-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical historical analysis==

===Early theories===
Critical scholarship is divided over its interpretation of the ten commandment texts.

[[Julius Wellhausen]]'s [[JEDP|influential hypothesis regarding the formation of the Pentateuch]] suggests that Exodus 20-23 and 34 "might be regarded as the document which formed the starting point of the religious history of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Julius Wellhausen 1973 ''Prolegomena to the History of Israel'' Glouster, MA: Peter Smith. 392&lt;/ref&gt; Deuteronomy 5 then reflects King Josiah's attempt to link the document produced by his court to the older Mosaic tradition.

In a 2002 analysis of the history of this position, [[Bernard M. Levinson]] argued that this reconstruction assumes a Christian perspective, and dates back to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s polemic against Judaism, which asserted that religions evolve from the more [[ritual]]istic to the more [[ethic]]al. Goethe thus argued that the Ten Commandments revealed to Moses at [[Mt. Sinai]] would have emphasized rituals, and that the "ethical" Decalogue Christians recite in their own churches was composed at a later date, when Israelite prophets had begun to prophesy the coming of the messiah, Jesus Christ. Levinson points out that there is no evidence, internal to the Hebrew Bible or in external sources, to support this conjecture. He concludes that its vogue among later critical historians represents the persistence of the idea that the [[supersession]] of Judaism by Christianity is part of a longer history of progress from the ritualistic to the ethical.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Bernard M. (July 2002). "Goethe's Analysis of Exodus 34 and Its Influence on Julius Wellhausen: the Pfropfung of the Documentary Hypothesis". ''Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft'' 114 (2): 212–223&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, historians who accepted the basic premises of multiple authorship had come to reject the idea of an orderly evolution of Israelite religion. Critics instead began to suppose that law and ritual could be of equal importance, while taking different form, at different times. This means that there is no longer any ''a priori'' reason to believe that Exodus 20:2–17 and Exodus 34:10–28 were composed during different stages of Israelite history. For example, critical historian [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]] also dates the Jahwist texts to the tenth century BCE, but believes that they express a theology that "had already been normalized in the period of the Judges" (i.e., of the tribal alliance).&lt;ref&gt;John Bright 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition. Philadelphia: the Westminster Press. 142–143&lt;br /&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q=%22normalized%22&amp;f=false 4th edition p.146-147] {{ISBN|0-664-22068-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concurs about the importance of the decalogue as "a central feature in the covenant that brought together Israel into being as a people"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q=%22central%20feature%22&amp;f=false |author=Bright, John |title=A History of Israel |edition=4|page=146 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|date=2000 |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but views the parallels between Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5, along with other evidence, as reason to believe that it is relatively close to its original form and Mosaic in origin.&lt;ref&gt;John Bright, 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition. Philadelphia: the Westminster Press. 142 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 4th ed. p.146+]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hittite treaties===
According to John Bright, however, there is an important distinction between the Decalogue and the "book of the covenant" (Exodus 21-23 and 34:10–24). The Decalogue, he argues, was modelled on the suzerainty treaties of the [[Hittites]] (and other Mesopotamian Empires), that is, represents the relationship between God and Israel as a relationship between king and vassal, and enacts that bond.&lt;ref&gt;John Bright, 1972, p., 146–147 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 4th ed. p.150–151]&lt;/ref&gt;

"The prologue of the Hittite treaty reminds his vassals of his benevolent acts.. (compare with Exodus 20:2 "I am the {{LORD}} your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery"). The Hittite treaty also stipulated the obligations imposed by the ruler on his vassals, which included a prohibition of relations with peoples outside the empire, or enmity between those within."&lt;ref&gt;Cornfeld, Gaalyahu Ed ''Pictorial Biblical Encyclopedia'', MacMillan 1964 p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; (Exodus 20:3: "You shall have no other gods before Me"). Viewed as a treaty rather than a law code, its purpose is not so much to regulate human affairs as to define the scope of the king's power.&lt;ref&gt;John Bright, 1972, p., 165 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 4th ed. p.169–170]&lt;/ref&gt;

Julius Morgenstern argued that Exodus 34 is distinct from the Jahwist document, identifying it with king Asa's reforms in 899 BCE.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{citation |first=Julius |last=Morgenstern |year=1927 |title=The Oldest Document of the [[Hexateuch]] |publisher=HUAC |volume=IV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bright, however, believes that like the Decalogue this text has its origins in the time of the tribal alliance. The book of the covenant, he notes, bears a greater similarity to Mesopotamian law codes (e.g. the [[Code of Hammurabi]] which was inscribed on a stone [[stele]]). He argues that the function of this "book" is to move from the realm of treaty to the realm of law: "The Book of the Covenant (Ex., chs. 21 to 23; cf. ch. 34), which is no official state law, but a description of normative Israelite judicial procedure in the days of the Judges, is the best example of this process."&lt;ref&gt;Bright, John, 2000, ''A History of Israel'' 4th ed. p.173.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bright, then, this body of law too predates the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;John Bright, 1972, p. 166 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 4th ed. p.170+]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilton J. Blik writes that the phrasing in the Decalogue's instructions suggests that it was conceived in a mainly polytheistic milieu, evident especially in the formulation of the [[henotheistic]] "no-other-gods-before-me" commandment.&lt;ref&gt;"The point here being underscored is that the Decalogue represents an earlier stage in the development of this tradition, and the Ten Commandments, when critically viewed, do not only NOT demand a monotheistic adherence, they clearly presuppose and affirm a polytheistic reality! Those who attempt to impose a principle of monotheism on the Ten Commandments are simply anticipating the historical development of the tradition ahead of its time and are thus already assuming what they pretend to discover." (''Tyranny, Taboo, and the Ten Commandments: The Decalogue Decoded And Its Impact on Civil Society'', Hilton J. Bik, Xlibris Corporation 2008, p.199).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

Aaron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://huc.edu/chronicle/68/articles/EtchedInStone.pdf |title= "Etched in Stone: The Emergence of the Decalogue" |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111005145800/http://huc.edu/chronicle/68/articles/EtchedInStone.pdf |archivedate= 5 October 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&amp;nbsp;(99.8&amp;nbsp;KB), ''The Chronicle'', Hebrew Union College – Jewish Institute of Religion, Issue 68, 2006, p. 42. "a critical survey of biblical literature demonstrates no cognizance of the ten commandments prior to the post-exilic period (after 586 B.C.E.)"&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ritual Decalogue===
{{Main|Ritual Decalogue}}
Some proponents of the [[Documentary hypothesis]] have argued that the biblical text in Exodus 34:28&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|34:28|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; identifies a different list as the ten commandments, that of Exodus 34:11–27.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|34:11–27|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this passage does not prohibit murder, adultery, theft, etc., but instead deals with the proper worship of [[Yahweh]], some scholars call it the "[[Ritual Decalogue]]", and disambiguate the ten commandments of traditional understanding as the "Ethical Decalogue".&lt;ref&gt;''The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha''. Augmented Third Edition, New Revised Standard Version, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Hebrew Bible: A Brief Socio-Literary Introduction''. Norman Gottwald, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the Old Testament: Pentateuch''. T. Desmond Alexander and David Weston Baker, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Commentary on the Torah''. Richard Elliott Friedman, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

According to these scholars the Bible includes multiple versions of events. On the basis of many points of analysis including linguistic it is shown as a patchwork of sources sometimes with bridging comments by the editor (Redactor) but otherwise left intact from the original, frequently side by side.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott. ''[[The Bible with Sources Revealed]]'', 2003 p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Elliott Friedman]] argues that the Ten Commandments at Exodus 20:1–17 "does not appear to belong to any of the major sources. It is likely to be an independent document, which was inserted here by the Redactor."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, the [[Covenant Code]] follows that version of the Ten Commandments in the northern Israel E narrative. In the J narrative in Exodus 34 the editor of the combined story known as the Redactor (or RJE), adds in an explanation that these are a replacement for the earlier tablets which were shattered. "In the combined JE text, it would be awkward to picture God just commanding Moses to make some tablets, as if there were no history to this matter, so RJE adds the explanation that these are a replacement for the earlier tablets that were shattered."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

He writes that Exodus 34:14–26 is the J text of the Ten Commandments: "The first two commandments and the sabbath commandment have parallels in the other versions of the Ten Commandments. (Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5). … The other seven commandments here are completely different."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests that differences in the J and E versions of the Ten Commandments story are a result of power struggles in the priesthood. The writer has Moses smash the tablets "because this raised doubts about the Judah's central religious shrine".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott. "Who Wrote The Bible?" 1987 pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kaufmann, the Decalogue and the book of the covenant represent two ways of manifesting God's presence in Israel: the Ten Commandments taking the archaic and material form of stone tablets kept in the [[ark of the covenant]], while the book of the covenant took oral form to be recited to the people.&lt;ref name=Kaufmann1960 /&gt;

'''Quranic reference''' to the ten commandments can be found in chapter 2 verses 83 and 84 "And [recall] when We took the covenant from the Children of Israel, [enjoining upon them], "Do not worship except Allah (1) ; and to parents do good (2) and to relatives (3), orphans (4), and the needy (5). And speak to people good words (6) and establish prayer (7) and give Zakat (8)." Then you turned away, except a few of you, and you were refusing."

"And [recall] when We took your covenant, [saying], "Do not shed each other's blood (9) or evict one another from your homes (10)." Then you acknowledged [this] while you were witnessing"

European Protestants replaced some visual art in their churches with plaques of the Ten Commandments after the Reformation. In England, such "Decalogue boards" also represented the English monarch's emphasis on rule of royal law within the churches. The United States Constitution forbids establishment of religion by law; however images of Moses holding the tablets of the Decalogue, along other religious figures including Solomon, Confucius, and Mohamed holding the Qur'an, are sculpted on the north and south friezes of the [[United States Supreme Court Building|pediment of the Supreme Court building in Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Curator, {{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/northandsouthwalls.pdf |title=Courtroom Friezes: North and South Walls}} Supreme Court of the United States, 5/8/2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Images of the Ten Commandments have long been contested symbols for the relationship of religion to national law.&lt;ref name="moses.creighton.edu"&gt;Watts, {{cite web|url=http://moses.creighton.edu/jrs/2004/2004-13.pdf |title=Ten Commandments Monuments}} 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s the [[Fraternal Order of Eagles]] placed possibly thousands of Ten Commandments displays in courthouses and school rooms, including many stone monuments on courthouse property.&lt;ref&gt;Emmet V. Mittlebeeler,
(2003) "Ten Commandments." P. 434 in ''The Encyclopedia of American Religion and Politics''. Edited by P. A. Djupe and L. R. Olson. New York: Facts on File.&lt;/ref&gt; Because displaying the commandments can reflect a sectarian position if they are numbered (see above), the Eagles developed an ecumenical version that omitted the numbers, as on the monument at the Texas capitol (shown here). Hundreds of monuments were also  placed by [[film director|director]] [[Cecil B. DeMille]] as a [[publicity stunt]] to promote his 1956 [[film]] ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200109/10_schmitzr_laxten-m/ |title=MPR: The Ten Commandments: Religious or historical symbol? |publisher=News.minnesota.publicradio.org |date=2001-09-10 |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placing the plaques and monuments to the Ten Commandments in and around government buildings was another expression of mid-twentieth century U.S. [[civil religion]], along with adding the phrase "under God" to the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]].&lt;ref name="moses.creighton.edu" /&gt;

By the beginning of the twenty-first century in the U.S., however, Decalogue monuments and plaques in government spaces had become a legal battleground between religious as well as political liberals and conservatives. Organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. The ACLU has been supported by a number of religious groups (such as the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]],&lt;ref&gt;PCUSA Assembly Committee on General Assembly Procedures D.3.a http://apps.pcusa.org/ga216/business/commbooks/comm03.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Jewish Congress]]&lt;ref&gt;American Jewish Congress, "AJCongress Voices Opposition to Courtroom Display of ten Commandments," (May 16, 2003) http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03&lt;/ref&gt;), both because they do not want government to be issuing religious doctrine and because they feel strongly that the commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider [[culture war]] between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the [[Liberty Counsel]], have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation. Many Christian conservatives have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] as a threat to the expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings.

Those who oppose the posting of the ten commandments on public property argue that it violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|establishment clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]]. In contrast, groups like the Fraternal Order of Eagles who support the public display of the ten commandments claim that the commandments are not necessarily religious but represent the moral and legal foundation of society, and are appropriate to be displayed as a historical source of present-day legal codes. Also, some argue like Judge [[Roy Moore]] that prohibiting the public practice of religion is a violation of the first amendment's guarantee of [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name="moses.creighton.edu" /&gt;

[[File:1 Gebot (Lucas Cranach d A).jpg|thumb|''The Ten Commandments'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in the townhall of [[Wittenberg]], (detail)]]
U.S. courts have often ruled against displays of the Ten Commandments on government property. They conclude that the ten commandments are derived from [[Judeo-Christian]] religions, to the exclusion of others: the statement "Thou shalt have no other gods before me" excludes non-monotheistic religions like [[Hinduism]], for example. Whether the Constitution prohibits the posting of the commandments or not, there are additional political and civil rights issues regarding the posting of what is construed as religious doctrine. Excluding religions that have not accepted the ten commandments creates the [[appearance of impropriety]]. The courts have been more accepting, however, of displays that place the Ten Commandments in a broader historical context of the development of law.

One result of these legal cases has been that proponents of displaying the Ten Commandments have sometimes surrounded them with other historical texts to portray them as historical, rather than religious. Another result has been that other religious organizations have tried to put monuments to their laws on public lands. For example, an organization called [[Summum]] has won court cases against municipalities in [[Utah]] for refusing to allow the group to erect a monument of Summum [[aphorisms]] next to the ten commandments. The cases were won on the grounds that Summum's right to [[freedom of speech]] was denied and the governments had engaged in [[discrimination]]. Instead of allowing Summum to erect its monument, the local governments chose to remove their ten commandments.

Both ''[[Dekalog]]'', a 1989 Polish film series directed by [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]], and ''[[The Ten]]'', a 2007 American film, use the ten commandments as a structure for 10 smaller stories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811106/ The Ten (2007) – IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The receipt of the Ten Commandments by Moses was satirized in [[Mel Brooks]]'s movie ''[[History of the World Part I]]'' (1981), which shows Moses (played by Brooks, in a similar costume to [[Charlton Heston]]'s Moses in the [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|1956 film]]), receiving three tablets containing fifteen commandments, but before he can present them to his people, he stumbles and drops one of the tablets, shattering it. He then presents the remaining tablets, proclaiming Ten Commandments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah-WdAwVg9c/ |title=Fifteen Commandments |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2012-08-10 |accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'', a 1998 animated film that depicted the early life of Moses (voiced by [[Val Kilmer]]), the ending depicts him with the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai, accompanied by a reprise of [[Deliver Us (The Prince of Egypt)|Deliver Us]].

The story of Moses and the Ten Commandments is discussed in the Danish stageplay ''[[Biblen]]'' (2008).

'''Theology''' is the critical study of the nature of [[Divinity|the divine]]. It is taught as an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]], typically in universities and [[seminaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;s=theology&amp;h=000&amp;j=0#c |title=theology |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theology is basically the study of [[deity|deities]] or their [[scripture]]s&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.compellingtruth.org/definition-theology.html What is the definition of theology? from compellingtruth.org]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to discover what they have revealed about themselves. While theology has turned into a [[secular|secular field]], religious adherents still consider theology to be a discipline that helps them live and understand concepts such as life and love and that helps them lead lives of obedience to the deities they follow or worship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gotquestions.org/what-is-theology.html What is the definition of theology? from gotquestions.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{Main article|History of theology}}
''Theology'' translates into English from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''theologia'' (θεολογία) which derived from ''Τheos'' (Θεός), meaning "[[God]]", and ''-logia'' (-λογία),&lt;ref&gt;The accusative plural of the neuter noun λόγιον; cf. Walter Bauer, William F. Arndt, F. Wilbur Gingrich, Frederick W. Danker, ''A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament,'' 2nd ed., (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1979), 476. For examples of λόγια in the New Testament, cf. Acts 7:38; Romans 3:2; 1 Peter 4:11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Constantine B. Scouteris]], Ἡ ἔννοια τῶν ὅρων "Θεολογία", "Θεολογεῖν", "Θεολόγος", ἐν τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ τῶν Ἑλλήνων Πατέρων καί Ἐκκλησιαστικῶν συγγραφέων μέχρι καί τῶν Καππαδοκῶν, Ἀθῆναι 1972, pp. 187 - Αναδημοσίευση στη νέα ελληνική 2016 [The Meaning of the Terms "Theology", "to Theologize" and "Theologian" in the Teaching of the Greek Fathers up to and Including the Cappadocians; (in Greek), Athens 1972, pp. 187 - Republication in 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "utterances, sayings, or [[oracle]]s" (a word related to ''logos'' [λόγος], meaning "word, [[discourse]], account, or [[reasoning]]") which had passed into Latin as ''theologia'' and into French as ''théologie''. The English equivalent "theology" (Theologie, Teologye) had evolved by 1362.&lt;ref&gt;Langland, [[Piers Plowman]] A ix 136&lt;/ref&gt; The sense the word has in English depends in large part on the sense the Latin and Greek equivalents had acquired in [[patristics|patristic]] and [[history of theology#Medieval Christian theology|medieval]] Christian usage, although the English term has now spread beyond Christian contexts.

==Definition==
[[Augustine of Hippo]] defined the [[Latin]] equivalent, ''theologia'', as "reasoning or discussion concerning the Deity";&lt;ref name="Cityof"&gt;''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' [http://logicmuseum.googlepages.com/civitate-8.htm Book VIII. i.] "de divinitate rationem sive sermonem" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404123631/http://logicmuseum.googlepages.com/civitate-8.htm |date=4 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Hooker]] defined "theology" in [[English language|English]] as "the science of things [[Divinity|divine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anglicanhistory.org/hooker/3/368-377.pdf |title='&amp;#39;Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity'&amp;#39;, 3.8.11 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term can, however, be used for a variety of different disciplines or fields of study.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alister McGrath|McGrath, Alister]]. 1998. Historical Theology: An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. pp. 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theology begins with the assumption that the [[divine]] exists in some form, such as in [[physics|physical]], [[supernatural]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|mental]], or [[social construction|social realities]], and that evidence for and about it may be found via personal spiritual experiences or historical records of such experiences as documented by others.  The study of these assumptions is not part of theology proper but is found in the [[philosophy of religion]], and increasingly through the [[psychology of religion]] and [[neurotheology]].  Theology then aims to structure and understand these experiences and concepts, and to use them to derive normative prescriptions for [[meaning of life|how to live our lives]].

Theologians use various forms of analysis and argument ([[Spirituality|experiential]], [[philosophy|philosophical]], [[ethnography|ethnographic]], [[history|historical]], and others) to help [[understanding|understand]], [[explanation|explain]], test, [[critique]], defend or promote any myriad of [[List of religious topics|religious topics]].  As in [[philosophy of ethics]] and [[case law]], arguments often assume the existence of previously resolved questions, and develop by making analogies from them to draw new inferences in new situations.

The study of theology may help a theologian more deeply understand their own religious [[tradition]],&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Daniel L. Migliore]], ''Faith Seeking Understanding: An Introduction to Christian Theology'' 2nd ed.(Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; another religious tradition,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Michael S. Kogan, 'Toward a Jewish Theology of Christianity' in ''The Journal of Ecumenical Studies'' 32.1 (Winter 1995), 89–106; available online at [http://www.icjs.org/scholars/kogan.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615100029/http://www.icjs.org/scholars/kogan.html|date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or it may enable them to explore the nature of divinity without reference to any specific tradition. Theology may be used to [[Proselytism|propagate]],&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Duncan Dormor et al (eds), ''Anglicanism, the Answer to Modernity'' (London: Continuum, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; reform,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., John Shelby Spong, ''Why Christianity Must Change or Die'' (New York: Harper Collins, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Apologetics|justify]] a religious tradition or it may be used to [[Comparative religion|compare]],&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., David Burrell, ''Freedom and Creation in Three Traditions'' (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; challenge (e.g. [[biblical criticism]]), or oppose (e.g. [[irreligion]]) a religious tradition or [[world-view]]. Theology might also help a theologian to address some present situation or need through a religious tradition,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Timothy Gorringe, ''Crime'', Changing Society and the Churches Series (London:SPCK, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; or to explore possible ways of interpreting the world.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Anne Hunt Overzee's gloss upon the view of [[Paul Ricœur|Ricœur]] (1913–2005) as to the role and work of 'theologian': "Paul Ricœur speaks of the theologian as a hermeneut, whose task is to interpret the multivalent, rich metaphors arising from the symbolic bases of tradition so that the symbols may 'speak' once again to our existential situation." Anne Hunt Overzee ''The body divine: the symbol of the body in the works of Teilhard de Chardin and Rāmānuja'', Cambridge studies in religious traditions 2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), {{ISBN|0-521-38516-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-38516-9}}, p.4; Source: [https://books.google.com/books?id=EiYEktsURVAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false &lt;nowiki&gt;[2]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] (accessed: Monday 5 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Plato]] (left) and Aristotle in [[Raphael]]'s 1509 fresco, ''[[The School of Athens]]''.]]
Greek ''theologia'' (θεολογία) was used with the meaning "discourse on god" in the fourth century BC by [[Plato]] in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Book ii, Ch. 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057;query=entry%3D%2348216;layout=;loc=qeolo%2Fgia1 Liddell and Scott's ''Greek-English Lexicon']'.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] divided theoretical philosophy into ''mathematike'', ''physike'' and ''theologike'', with the last corresponding roughly to [[metaphysics]], which, for Aristotle, included discourse on the nature of the divine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/mirror/classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.6.vi.html Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', Book Epsilon.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216173401/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/mirror/classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.6.vi.html |date=16 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on Greek [[Stoicism|Stoic]] sources, the [[Latin]] writer [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] distinguished three forms of such discourse: [[Mythology|mythical]] (concerning the myths of the Greek gods), rational (philosophical analysis of the gods and of cosmology) and civil (concerning the rites and duties of public religious observance).&lt;ref&gt;As cited by Augustine, ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'', [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120106.htm Book 6], ch.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Theologos'', closely related to theologia, appears once in some [[biblical manuscript]]s, in the heading to the [[Book of Revelation]]: ''apokalypsis ioannoy toy theologoy'', "the revelation of John the ''theologos''". There, however, the word refers not to John the "theologian" in the modern English sense of the word but—using a slightly different sense of the root ''logos'', meaning not "rational discourse" but "word" or "message"—one who speaks the words of God, ''logoi toy theoy''.&lt;ref&gt;This title appears quite late in the manuscript tradition for the Book of Revelation: the two earliest citations provided in [[David Aune]]'s ''Word Biblical Commentary 52: Revelation 1–5'' (Dallas: Word Books, 1997) are both 11th century – Gregory 325/Hoskier 9 and Gregory 1006/Hoskier 215; the title was however in circulation by the 6th century – see Allen Brent 'John as theologos: the imperial mysteries and the Apocalypse', ''Journal for the Study of the New Testament'' 75 (1999), 87–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Latin Christian authors, such as [[Tertullian]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], followed Varro's threefold usage,&lt;ref&gt;See Augustine, ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'', [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120106.htm Book 6], ch.5. and Tertullian, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.iv.viii.ii.i.html ''Ad Nationes'', Book 2], ch.1.&lt;/ref&gt; though Augustine also used the term more simply to mean 'reasoning or discussion concerning the deity'&lt;ref name="Cityof" /&gt;

In [[Church Fathers|patristic]] Greek Christian sources, ''theologia'' could refer narrowly to devout and inspired knowledge of, and teaching about, the essential nature of God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory of Nazianzus]] uses the word in this sense in his fourth-century [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-07/Npnf2-07-42.htm#P4178_1277213 ''Theological Orations'']; after his death, he was called "the Theologian" at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] and thereafter in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]—either because his ''Orations''were seen as crucial examples of this kind of theology, or in the sense that he was (like the author of the Book of Revelation) seen as one who was an inspired preacher of the words of God. (It is unlikely to mean, as claimed in the [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-07/Npnf2-07-41.htm#P4162_1255901 ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers''] introduction to his ''Theological Orations'', that he was a defender of the divinity of Christ the Word.) See John McGukin, ''[[Gregory of Nazianzus|Saint Gregory of Nazianzus]]: An Intellectual Biography'' (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 2001), p.278.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin author [[Boethius]], writing in the early 6th century, used ''theologia'' to denote a subdivision of philosophy as a subject of academic study, dealing with the motionless, incorporeal reality (as opposed to ''physica'', which deals with [[Matter|corporeal]], moving realities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pvspade.com/Logic/docs/BoethiusDeTrin.pdf |title=Boethius, On the Holy Trinity |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boethius' definition influenced medieval Latin usage.&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Evans, ''Old Arts and New Theology: The Beginnings of Theology as an Academic Discipline'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980), 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[scholasticism|scholastic]] Latin sources, the term came to denote the rational study of the [[doctrine]]s of the [[Christian religion]], or (more precisely) the academic [[discipline]] which investigated the coherence and implications of the language and claims of the Bible and of the theological tradition (the latter often as represented in [[Peter Lombard]]'s ''[[Sentences]]'', a book of extracts from the Church Fathers).&lt;ref&gt;See the title of [[Peter Abelard]]'s [http://individual.utoronto.ca/pking/resources/abelard/Theologia_christiana.txt ''Theologia Christiana''], and, perhaps most famously, of [[Thomas Aquinas]]' ''[[Summa Theologica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Renaissance, especially with Florentine Platonist apologists of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s poetics, the distinction between "poetic theology" (''[[Theologia Poetica|theologia poetica]]'') and "revealed" or Biblical theology serves as steppingstone for a revival of philosophy as independent of theological authority.

It is in this last sense, theology as an academic discipline involving rational study of Christian teaching, that the term passed into English in the fourteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;See the 'note' in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] entry for 'theology'.&lt;/ref&gt; although it could also be used in the narrower sense found in Boethius and the Greek patristic authors, to mean rational study of the essential nature of God – a discourse now sometimes called [[theology proper]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Charles Hodge, ''Systematic Theology'', vol. 1, part 1 (1871).&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 17th century onwards, it also became possible to use the term theology to refer to study of religious ideas and teachings that are not specifically Christian (e.g., in the term [[natural theology]] which denoted theology based on reasoning from natural facts independent of specifically Christian revelation,&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', sense 1&lt;/ref&gt;) or that are specific to another religion (see below).

"Theology" can also now be used in a derived sense to mean "a system of theoretical principles; an (impractical or rigid) ideology".&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1989 edition, 'Theology' sense 1(d), and 'Theological' sense A.3; the earliest reference given is from the 1959 ''Times Literary Supplement'' 5 June 329/4: "The 'theological' approach to Soviet Marxism ... proves in the long run unsatisfactory."&lt;/ref&gt;

==In various religions==
The term theology has been deemed by some as only appropriate to the study of religions that worship a supposed [[deity]] (a ''theos''), i.e. more widely than [[monotheism]]; and presuppose a belief in the ability to speak and [[reason]] about this deity (in ''logia''). They suggest the term is less appropriate in religious contexts that are organized differently (religions without a single deity, or that deny that such subjects can be studied logically). ("[[Hierology]]" has been proposed as an alternative, more generic term.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., by Count E. Goblet d'Alviella in 1908; see Alan H. Jones, ''Independence and Exegesis: The Study of Early Christianity in the Work of Alfred Loisy (1857–1940), Charles Guignebert (1857 [i.e. 1867]–1939), and Maurice Goguel (1880–1955)'' (Mohr Siebeck, 1983), p.194.&lt;/ref&gt;)

In [[Jewish theology]], the historical absence of political authority has meant that most theological reflection has happened within the context of the Jewish community and [[synagogue]], including through [[Rabbinical]] discussion of [[Jewish law]] and [[Midrash|Jewish Biblical commentaries]].  Jewish theology is linked to [[ethics]] and therefore has implications for how one behaves.&lt;ref&gt;Libenson, Dan and Lex Rofeberg, hosts.

Judaism's fundamental beliefs are inextricable from their halakhic observance (that set of laws revealed to Jews by God), embedded and presupposed by that way of life as it is lived and learned."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity====
[[File:Carlo Crivelli 007.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Aquinas]] was the greatest Christian theologian of the Middle Ages.|217x217px]]
[[Christian theology]] is the study of Christian belief and practice. Such study concentrates primarily upon the texts of the Old Testament and the New Testament as well as on Christian tradition. Christian theologians use biblical exegesis, rational analysis and argument. Theology might be undertaken to help the theologian better understand Christian tenets, to make comparisons between Christianity and other traditions, to defend Christianity against objections and criticism, to facilitate reforms in the Christian church, to assist in the propagation of Christianity, to draw on the resources of the Christian tradition to address some present situation or need, or for a variety of other reasons.

====Islam====
[[File:Abul ala maududi.jpg|thumb|[[Allamah]] [[Abul A'la Maududi|Sayyid Abul A'la Maududi]] was the most influential Islamic theologian of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Lerman&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lerman|first1=Eran|title=Maududi's Concept of Islam|jstor=4282856|publisher=JSTOR|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|volume=17|number=4 |date=October 1981|pages=492–509 |quote=it is hard to exaggerate the importance of its [Pakistan's] current drift toward's Maududi's version of Islam|doi=10.1080/00263208108700487}}&lt;/ref&gt;|156x156px]]
[[Islamic theology|Islamic theological]] discussion that parallels Christian theological discussion is named "[[Kalam]]"; the Islamic analogue of Christian theological discussion would more properly be the investigation and elaboration of [[Sharia]] or [[Fiqh]]. "Kalam ... does not hold the leading place in Muslim thought that theology does in Christianity. To find an equivalent for 'theology' in the Christian sense it is necessary to have recourse to several disciplines, and to the usul al-fiqh as much as to kalam." (L. Gardet)&lt;ref&gt;L. Gardet, '[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ei2/kalam.htm Ilm al-kalam]' in ''The Encyclopedia of Islam'', ed. P.J. Bearman et al (Leiden: [[Brill Publishers|Koninklijke Brill NV, 1999]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian religions===
====Hinduism====
Within [[Hindu philosophy]], there is a tradition of philosophical speculation on the nature of the universe, of God (termed "[[Brahman]]", [[Paramatma]] and [[Bhagavan]] in some schools of Hindu thought) and of the [[atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul). The [[Sanskrit]] word for the various schools of Hindu philosophy is [[Darshana]] (meaning "view" or "viewpoint"). [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava theology]] has been a subject of study for many devotees, philosophers and scholars in [[India]] for centuries.  A large part of its study lies in classifying and organizing the manifestations of thousands of gods and their aspects.  In recent decades the study of Hinduism has also been taken up by a number of academic institutions in Europe, such as the [[Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies]] and [[Bhaktivedanta College]].&lt;ref&gt;See Anna S. King, 'For Love of Krishna: Forty Years of Chanting' in Graham Dwyer and Richard J. Cole, ''The Hare Krishna Movement: Forty Years of Chant and Change'' (London/New York: I.B. Tauris, 2006), pp. 134–167: p. 163, which describes developments in both institutions, and speaks of Hare Krishna devotees 'studying Vaishnava theology and practice in mainstream universities.'&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also: [[Krishnology]]''

====Buddhism====
Some academic inquiries within [[Buddhism]], dedicated to the investigation of a Buddhist understanding of the world, prefer the designation [[Buddhist philosophy]] to the term Buddhist theology, since Buddhism lacks the same conception of a ''theos''. Jose Ignacio Cabezon, who argues that the use of "theology" ''is'' appropriate, can only do so, he says, because "I take theology not to be restricted to discourse on God ... I take 'theology' not to be restricted to its etymological meaning. In that latter sense, Buddhism is of course ''a''theological, rejecting as it does the notion of God."&lt;ref&gt;Jose Ignacio Cabezon, 'Buddhist Theology in the Academy' in Roger Jackson and John J. Makransky's ''Buddhist Theology: Critical Reflections by Contemporary Buddhist Scholars'' (London: Routledge, 1999), pp. 25–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an academic discipline==
The history of the study of theology in institutions of higher education is as old as the [[University#History|history]] of such institutions themselves. For instance, [[Taxila]] was an early centre of Vedic learning, possible from the 6th century BC or earlier;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Reagan, ''Non-Western Educational Traditions: Alternative Approaches to Educational Thought and Practice'', 3rd edition (Lawrence Erlbaum: 2004), p.185 and Sunna Chitnis, 'Higher Education' in Veena Das (ed), ''The Oxford India Companion to Sociology and Social Anthropology'' (New Delhi: [[Oxford University Press]], 2003), pp. 1032–1056: p.1036 suggest an early date; a more cautious appraisal is given in Hartmut Scharfe, ''Education in Ancient India'' (Leiden: Brill, 2002), pp. 140–142.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Platonic Academy]] founded in Athens in the 4th century BC seems to have included theological themes in its subject matter;&lt;ref&gt;John Dillon, ''The Heirs of Plato: A Study in the Old Academy, 347–274BC (Oxford: OUP, 2003)''&lt;/ref&gt; the Chinese [[Taixue]] delivered Confucian teaching from the 2nd century BC;&lt;ref&gt;Xinzhong Yao, ''An Introduction to Confucianism'' (Cambridge: CUP, 2000), p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[School of Nisibis]] was a centre of Christian learning from the 4th century AD;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Adam H. |last=Becker |title=The Fear of God and the Beginning of Wisdom: The School of Nisibis and the Development of Scholastic Culture in Late Antique Mesopotamia |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]] |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nestorian.org/the_school_of_nisibis.html |title=The School of Nisibis |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231841/http://www.nestorian.org/the_school_of_nisibis.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |work=Nestorian.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nalanda]] in India was a site of Buddhist higher learning from at least the 5th or 6th century AD;&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Scharfe, ''Education in Ancient India'' (Leiden: Brill, 2002), p.149.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Moroccan [[University of Al-Karaouine]] was a centre of Islamic learning from the 10th century,&lt;ref&gt;The Al-Qarawiyyin mosque was founded in 859 AD, but 'While instruction at the mosque must have begun almost from the beginning, it is only ... by the end of the tenth-century that its reputation as a center of learning in both religious and secular sciences ... must have begun to wax.' Y. G-M. Lulat, ''A History of African Higher Education from Antiquity to the Present: A Critical Synthesis'' (Greenwood, 2005), p.71&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Al-Azhar University]] in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Beattie, ''Cairo: A Cultural History'' (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2005), p.101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the [[Latin Church]] by [[papal bull]] as ''[[Studium Generale|studia generalia]]'' and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible, however,  that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Leff, ''Paris and Oxford Universities in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries. An Institutional and Intellectual History'', Wiley, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Later they were also founded by Kings ([[University of Naples Federico II]], [[Charles University in Prague]], [[Jagiellonian University|Jagiellonian University in Kraków]]) or municipal administrations ([[University of Cologne]], [[University of Erfurt]]). In the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval period]], most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, P. (2000). The Renaissance : a short history. Modern Library chronicles (Modern Library ed.). New York: Modern Library, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Christian theological learning was therefore a component in these institutions, as was the study of Church or [[Canon law]]: universities played an important role in training people for ecclesiastical offices, in helping the church pursue the clarification and defence of its teaching, and in supporting the legal rights of the church over against secular rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Rüegg, "Themes" in Walter Rüegg, ''A History of the University in Europe'', vol.1, ed. H. de Ridder-Symoens, ''Universities in the Middle Ages'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 3–34: pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; At such universities, theological study was initially closely tied to the life of faith and of the church: it fed, and was fed by, practices of [[preaching]], [[prayer]] and celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Gavin D'Costa]], ''Theology in the Public Square: Church, Academy and Nation'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 2005), ch.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the High Middle Ages, theology was therefore the ultimate subject at universities, being named "The Queen of the Sciences" and serving as the capstone to the [[trivium (education)|Trivium]] and [[Quadrivium]] that young men were expected to study. This meant that the other subjects (including [[Philosophy]]) existed primarily to help with theological thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Albert (Tal) Howard|Thomas Albert Howard]], ''[https://global.oup.com/academic/product/protestant-theology-and-the-making-of-the-modern-german-university-9780199266852?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; Protestant Theology and the Making of the Modern German University]'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2006), p.56: '[P]hilosophy, the ''scientia scientarum'' in one sense, was, in another, portrayed as the humble "handmaid of theology".'&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian theology's preeminent place in the university began to be challenged during the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], especially in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Thomas Albert (Tal) Howard|Thomas Albert Howard]], ''[https://global.oup.com/academic/product/protestant-theology-and-the-making-of-the-modern-german-university-9780199266852?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; Protestant Theology and the Making of the Modern German University]'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2006):&lt;/ref&gt; Other subjects gained in independence and prestige, and questions were raised about the place of a discipline that seemed to involve commitment to the authority of particular religious traditions in institutions that were increasingly understood to be devoted to independent reason.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Thomas Albert (Tal) Howard|Thomas Albert Howard]]'s work already cited, and his discussion of, for instance, Immanuel Kant's ''Conflict of the Faculties'' (1798), and J.G. Fichte's ''Deduzierter Plan einer zu Berlin errichtenden höheren Lehranstalt'' (1807).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early nineteenth century, various different approaches have emerged in the West to theology as an academic discipline. Much of the debate concerning theology's place in the university or within a general higher education curriculum centres on whether theology's methods are appropriately theoretical and (broadly speaking) scientific or, on the other hand, whether theology requires a pre-commitment of faith by its practitioners, and whether such a commitment conflicts with academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Thomas Albert (Tal) Howard|Thomas Albert Howard]], ''[https://global.oup.com/academic/product/protestant-theology-and-the-making-of-the-modern-german-university-9780199266852?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; Protestant Theology and the Making of the Modern German University]'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2006); Hans W. Frei, ''Types of Christian Theology'', ed. William C. Placher and George Hunsinger (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1992); Gavin D'Costa, ''Theology in the Public Square: Church, Academy and Nation'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 2005); James W. McClendon, ''Systematic Theology 3: Witness'' (Nashville, TN: Abingdon, 2000), ch.10: 'Theology and the University'.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministerial training===
In some contexts, theology has been held to belong in institutions of higher education primarily as a form of professional training for Christian ministry. This was the basis on which [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], a liberal theologian, argued for the inclusion of theology in the new University of Berlin in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Schleiermacher, ''Brief Outline of Theology as a Field of Study'', 2nd edition, tr. Terrence N. Tice (Lewiston, NY: Edwin Mellen, 1990); [[Thomas Albert (Tal) Howard|Thomas Albert Howard]], ''[https://global.oup.com/academic/product/protestant-theology-and-the-making-of-the-modern-german-university-9780199266852?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; Protestant Theology and the Making of the Modern German University]'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2006), ch.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, in [[Germany]], theological faculties at state universities are typically tied to particular denominations, Protestant or Roman Catholic, and those faculties will offer denominationally-bound ''(konfessionsgebunden)'' degrees, and have denominationally bound public posts amongst their faculty; as well as contributing 'to the development and growth of Christian knowledge' they 'provide the academic training for the future clergy and teachers of religious instruction at German schools.'&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard G. Kratz, 'Academic Theology in Germany', ''Religion'' 32.2 (2002): pp.113–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, several prominent colleges and universities were started in order to train Christian ministers. [[Harvard]],&lt;ref&gt;'The primary purpose of Harvard College was, accordingly, the training of clergy.' But 'the school served a dual purpose, training men for other professions as well.' George M. Marsden, ''The Soul of the American University: From Protestant Establishment to Established Nonbelief'' (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 1994), p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]],&lt;ref&gt;Georgetown was a Jesuit institution founded in significant part to provide a pool of educated Catholics some of whom who could go on to full seminary training for the priesthood. See Robert Emmett Curran, Leo J. O'Donovan, ''The Bicentennial History of Georgetown University: From Academy to University 1789–1889 (Georgetown: Georgetown University Press, 1961), Part One.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boston University]], [[Yale]],&lt;ref&gt;Yale's original 1701 charter speaks of the purpose being 'Sincere Regard &amp; Zeal for upholding &amp; Propagating of the Christian Protestant Religion by a succession of Learned &amp; Orthodox' and that 'Youth may be instructed in the Arts and Sciences (and) through the blessing of Almighty God may be fitted for Publick employment both in Church and Civil State.' 'The Charter of the Collegiate School, October 1701' in Franklin Bowditch Dexter, ''Documentary History of Yale University, Under the Original Charter of the Collegiate School of Connecticut 1701–1745'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1916); available online at [https://archive.org/stream/documentaryhisto00dextrich]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]&lt;ref&gt;At Princeton, one of the founders (probably Ebeneezer Pemberton) wrote in c.1750, 'Though our great Intention was to erect a seminary for educating Ministers of the Gospel, yet we hope it will be useful in other learned professions – Ornaments of the State as Well as the Church. Therefore we propose to make the plan of Education as extensive as our Circumstances will admit.' Quoted in Alexander Leitch, [http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/founding_princeton.html ''A Princeton Companion''] (Princeton University Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; all had the theological training of clergy as a primary purpose at their foundation.

Seminaries and bible colleges have continued this alliance between the academic study of theology and training for Christian ministry. There are, for instance, numerous prominent US examples, including [[Catholic Theological Union]] in Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctu.edu/about/ctu-story |title=The CTU Story |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307174208/http://www.ctu.edu/about/ctu-story |archive-date=March 7, 2013 |work=[[Catholic Theological Union]] |accessdate=March 16, 2013 |quote=lay men and women, religious sisters and brothers, and seminarians have studied alongside one another, preparing to serve God's people}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Graduate Theological Union]] in Berkeley,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.gtu.edu/about 'About the GTU'] at The Graduate Theological Union website (Retrieved 29 August 2009): 'dedicated to educating students for teaching, research, ministry, and service.'&lt;/ref&gt; [[Criswell College]] in Dallas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criswell.edu/news--events/about-us/ |title=The Criswell Vision |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426034342/http://www.criswell.edu/news--events/about-us/ |archive-date=April 26, 2010 |work=[[Criswell College]] |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |quote=Criswell College exists to serve the churches of our Lord Jesus Christ by developing God-called men and women in the Word (intellectually and academically) and by the Word (professionally and spiritually) for authentic ministry leadership}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] in Louisville,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbts.edu/about/truth/mission/ |title=Mission Statement |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329082518/http://www.sbts.edu/about/truth/mission/ |archive-date=March 29, 2015 |work=[[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] |access-date=August 29, 2009 |quote=the mission of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary is ... to be a servant of the churches of the Southern Baptist Convention by training, educating, and preparing ministers of the gospel for more faithful service}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trinity Evangelical Divinity School]] in Deerfield, Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tiu.edu/divinity/connect/whoarewe/ |title=About Trinity Evangelical Divinity School |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830165955/http://www.tiu.edu/divinity/connect/whoarewe/ |archive-date=August 30, 2011 |work=[[Trinity Evangelical Divinity School]] |access-date=August 29, 2009 |quote=Trinity Evangelical Divinity School (TEDS) is a learning community dedicated to the development of servant leaders for the global church, leaders who are spiritually, biblically, and theologically prepared to engage contemporary culture for the sake of Christ's kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dallas Theological Seminary]],&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.dts.edu/about/ 'About DTS'] at the Dallas Theological Seminary website (Retrieved 29 August 2009): 'At Dallas, the scholarly study of biblical and related subjects is inseparably fused with the cultivation of the spiritual life.

===As an academic discipline in its own right===
In some contexts, scholars pursue theology as an academic discipline without formal affiliation to any particular church (though members of staff may well have affiliations to churches), and without focussing on ministerial training. This applies, for instance, to many university departments in the [[United Kingdom]], including the Faculties of Divinity at the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford]], the Department of Theology and Religion at the [[University of Exeter]], and the Department of Theology and Religious Studies at the [[University of Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;
See the [http://huss.exeter.ac.uk/theology/undergrad/ 'Why Study Theology?'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809201252/http://huss.exeter.ac.uk/theology/undergrad/ |date=9 August 2009 }} page at the University of Exeter (Retrieved 1 September 2009), and the [http://www.leeds.ac.uk//trs/aboutus.htm 'About us'] page at the University of Leeds.

===Religious studies===
In some contemporary contexts, a distinction is made between theology, which is seen as involving some level of commitment to the claims of the religious tradition being studied, and [[religious studies]], which by contrast is normally seen as requiring that the question of the truth or falsehood of the religious traditions studied be kept outside its field. Religious studies involves the study of historical or contemporary practices or of those traditions' ideas using intellectual tools and frameworks that are not themselves specifically tied to any religious tradition and that are normally understood to be neutral or secular.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Donald Wiebe, ''The Politics of Religious Studies: The Continuing Conflict with Theology in the Academy'' (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; In contexts where 'religious studies' in this sense is the focus, the primary forms of study are likely to include:
* [[Anthropology of religion]]
* [[Comparative religion]]
* [[History of religion]]s
* [[Philosophy of religion]]
* [[Psychology of religion]]
* [[Sociology of religion]]
Sometimes, theology and religious studies are seen as being in tension,&lt;ref&gt;See K.L. Knoll, [http://chronicle.com/article/The-Ethics-of-Being-a/47442/ 'The Ethics of Being a Theologian'], ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', 27 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and at other times, they are held to coexist without serious tension.&lt;ref&gt;See David Ford, 'Theology and Religious Studies for a Multifaith and Secular Society' in D.L. Bird and Simon G. Smith (eds), ''Theology and Religious Studies in Higher Education'' (London: Continuum, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally it is denied that there is as clear a boundary between them.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fitzgerald, ''The Ideology of Religious Studies'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism&lt;!--'Criticism of theology' redirects here--&gt;==
{{see also|Criticism of religion}}
===Before the 20th century===
Whether or not reasoned discussion about the divine is possible has long been a point of contention. [[Protagoras]], as early as the fifth century BC, who is reputed to have been exiled from Athens because of his agnosticism about the existence of the gods, said that "Concerning the gods I cannot know either that they exist or that they do not exist, or what form they might have, for there is much to prevent one's knowing: the ''obscurity of the subject'' and the shortness of man's life."&lt;ref&gt;Protagoras, fr.4, from ''On the Gods'', tr. Michael J. O'Brien in ''The Older Sophists'', ed. Rosamund Kent Sprague (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1972), 20, emphasis added. Cf.

Since at least the eighteenth century, various authors have criticized the suitability of theology as an academic discipline.&lt;ref name="Loughlin2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Loughlin|first=Gerard|authorlink=Gerard Loughlin|date=2009|chapter=11- Theology in the university|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=myz9IWlszzgC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq|title=The Cambridge Companion to John Henry Newman|editor1-last=Ker|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Merrigan|editor2-first=Terrance|location=Cambridge, England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/CCOL9780521871860.011|pages=221–240|ref=harv|isbn=9780521871860}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772, [[Baron d'Holbach]] labeled theology "a continual insult to human reason" in ''Le Bon sens''.&lt;ref name="Loughlin2009"/&gt; [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Lord Bolingbroke]], an English politician and political philosopher, wrote in Section IV of his ''Essays on Human Knowledge'', "Theology is in fault not religion. Theology is a science that may justly be compared to the [[Box of Pandora]]. Many good things lie uppermost in it; but many evil lie under them, and scatter plagues and desolation throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w25JAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA396&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;dq=theology+is+the+box+of+pandora+bolingbroke&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qhYZzpliQS&amp;sig=k5bTM79761fMV0JqzqYFqwuz6ng&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jJ4hUa05geryBN6EgcgI&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=theology%20is%20the%20box%20of%20pandora%20bolingbroke&amp;f=false  The philosophical works of Lord Bolingbroke] Volume 3, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Paine]], a [[Deism|Deistic]] American political theorist and [[pamphleteer]], wrote in his three-part work ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' (published in 1794, 1795, and 1807), "The study of theology, as it stands in Christian churches, is the study of nothing; it is founded on nothing; it rests on no principles; it proceeds by no authorities; it has no data; it can demonstrate nothing; and it admits of no conclusion. Not anything can be studied as a science, without our being in possession of the principles upon which it is founded; and as this is the case with Christian theology, it is therefore the study of nothing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Paine]], [[The Age of Reason]], from "The Life and Major Writings of Thomas Paine", ed. [[Philip S. Foner]], (New York, The Citadel Press, 1945) p. 601.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German atheist philosopher [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] sought to dissolve theology in his work ''Principles of the Philosophy of the Future'': "The task of the modern era was the realization and humanization of God – the transformation and dissolution of theology into anthropology."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Principles of the Philosophy of the Future]], trans. Manfred H. Vogel, (Indianapolis, Hackett Publishing Company, 1986) p5&lt;/ref&gt; This mirrored his earlier work ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (pub. 1841), for which he was banned from teaching in Germany, in which he had said that theology was a "web of contradictions and delusions".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Feuerbach]], ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'', trans. [[George Eliot]], (Amherst, New York, Prometheus Books, 1989) Preface, XVI.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American satirist [[Mark Twain]] remarked in his essay "[[The Lowest Animal]]", originally written in around 1896, but not published until after Twain's death in 1910,&lt;ref name="Twain1896"&gt;{{cite web|last=Twain|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Twain|date=1896|title=The Lowest Animal|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/the-lowest-animal-by-mark-twain-1690158|website=thoughtco.com|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "[Man] is the only animal that [[Great Commandment|loves his neighbor as himself]] and cuts his throat if his theology isn't straight.

Ayer]], a British former [[Logical positivism|logical-positivist]], sought to show in his essay "Critique of Ethics and Theology" that all statements about the divine are nonsensical and any divine-attribute is unprovable. He wrote: "It is now generally admitted, at any rate by philosophers, that the existence of a being having the attributes which define the god of any non-animistic religion cannot be demonstratively proved... [A]ll utterances about the nature of God are nonsensical."&lt;ref&gt;[[A.J. Ayer]], [[Language, Truth and Logic]], (New York, Dover Publications, 1936) pp. 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jewish atheism|Jewish atheist]] philosopher [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], in his essay "Against Theology", sought to differentiate theology from religion in general. "Theology, of course, is not religion; and a great deal of religion is emphatically anti-theological... An attack on theology, therefore, should not be taken as necessarily involving an attack on religion. Religion can be, and often has been, untheological or even anti-theological." However, Kaufmann found that "Christianity is inescapably a theological religion".&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], [[The Faith of a Heretic]], (Garden City, New York, Anchor Books, 1963) pp. 114, 127–128, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English atheist [[Charles Bradlaugh]] believed theology prevented human beings achieving liberty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/bradlaugh.htm |title=Charles Bradlaugh (1833-1891) |publisher=Positiveatheism.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501025921/https://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/bradlaugh.htm |archivedate=1 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although he also noted that many theologians of his time held that, because modern scientific research sometimes contradicts sacred scriptures, the scriptures must therefore be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/bradlo01.htm |title=Humanity's Gain from Unbelief |publisher=Positiveatheism.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717060256/https://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/bradlo01.htm |archivedate=17 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert G. Ingersoll]], an American agnostic lawyer, stated that, when theologians had power, the majority of people lived in hovels, while a privileged few had palaces and cathedrals. In Ingersoll's opinion, it was science that improved people's lives, not theology. Ingersoll further maintained that trained theologians reason no better than a person who assumes the devil must exist because pictures resemble the devil so exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/ingersoll.htm |title=Robert Green Ingersoll |publisher=Positiveatheism.org |date=1954-08-11 |accessdate=2012-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805171007/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/ingersoll.htm |archivedate=5 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] has been an outspoken critic of theology.&lt;ref name="Loughlin2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins1993"/&gt; In an article published in ''[[The Independent]]'' in 1993, he severely criticizes theology as entirely useless,&lt;ref name="Dawkins1993"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawkin|first=Richard|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/letter-scientific-versus-theological-knowledge-1498837.html|title=Letter: Scientific versus theological knowledge|date=20 March 1993|work=The Independent|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; declaring that it has completely and repeatedly failed to answer any questions about the nature of reality or the human condition.&lt;ref name="Dawkins1993"/&gt; He states, "I have never heard any of them [i.e. theologians] ever say anything of the smallest use, anything that was not either platitudinously obvious or downright false."&lt;ref name="Dawkins1993"/&gt; He then states that, if all theology were completely eradicated from the earth, no one would notice or even care.&lt;ref name="Dawkins1993"/&gt; He concludes: "The achievements of theologians don't do anything, don't affect anything, don't achieve anything, don't even mean anything. What makes you think that 'theology' is a subject at all?"&lt;ref name="Dawkins1993"/&gt;

The '''World Day of Peace''' is a feast day of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] dedicated to [[world peace|universal peace]], held on 1 January, the [[Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God]]. [[Pope Paul VI]] established it in 1967, being inspired by the encyclical ''[[Pacem in Terris]]'' of [[Pope John XXIII]] and with reference to his own encyclical ''[[Populorum Progressio]]''. The day was first observed on 1 January 1968.

World Day of Peace often has been an occasion on which the Popes made [[Magisterium|magisterial]] declarations of [[Catholic social teaching|social doctrine]]. [[Pope Paul VI]] and [[Pope John Paul II]] made important declarations on the Day in each year of their pontificates regarding the [[United Nations]], [[human rights]], [[women's rights]], [[labor union|labor unions]], [[economic development]], [[right to life|the right to life]], international [[diplomacy]], peace in the [[Holy Land]] ([[Israel]]), [[globalization]], and [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/60000705.html?dids=60000705:60000705&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Dec+19%2C+1990&amp;author=WILLIAM+D.+MONTALBANO&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Pope+Assails+Totalitarianism%2C+Intolerance+Religion%3A+John+Paul%2C+in+World+Day+of+Peace+message%2C+also+calls+fundamentalism+a+threat+to+peace.&amp;pqatl=google ''Pope Assails Totalitarianism, Intolerance of Religion: John Paul, in World Day of Peace Message, Also Calls Fundamentalism a Threat to Peace.''] ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England and Wales]], "Peace Sunday" is traditionally observed on the Second Sunday of Ordinary Time, which is the Sunday occurring between 14 and 20 January, inclusive. The British branch of the [[Pax Christi]] movement prepares suggested material for it annually.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Bishop Malcolm McMahon to Catholic Parishes in England and Wales for Peace Sunday 2012, partially quoted in [http://www.paxchristi.org.uk/press1.php].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yongming Yanshou''' ({{zh|t=永明延壽|p=|w=Yung-ming Yen-shou}}; {{CJKV|k=Yǒngmyǒng Yǒnsu|j=永明延寿 or Yōmyō Enju|v=Vĩnh Minh Diên Thọ}}) (904–975) was a prominent [[Buddhist]] monk during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] and early [[Song Dynasty]] in [[China]].

==Biography==
Yongming Yanshou is first mentioned in biographical form by Zanning (贊寧) in a work called the ''Song Biographies of Eminent Monks'' ({{zh|t=宋高僧傳|p=song gaoseng zhuan}}), which was produced in 988, 12 years after Yanshou's death.&lt;ref name=Wel&gt;{{citation|last=Welter|first=Albert|title=Yongming Yanshou's Conception of Chan in the Zongjing Lu: A Special Transmission Within the Scriptures|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-976031-2|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WelDis&gt;{{citation|last=Welter|first=Albert|title=The Meaning of Myriad Good Deeds: A Study of Yung-ming Yen-shou and the Wan-shan t'ung-kuei chi|year=1992|isbn=978-0-8204-1796-7|publisher=P. Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yanshou lived largely during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]], in the independent [[Wuyue|Wuyue kingdom]]. This age was characterized by nearly continuous warfare and political disorder. The future of Buddhism was especially uncertain during this time due to widespread [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China|suppression and sponsored destruction of temples]]. However, most of this activity took place in the north of China, while Yanshou resided in the independent [[Wuyue|Wuyue kingdom]] of the south, which was relatively stable during this time. Furthermore, unlike the trouble Buddhism faced in the north, the ruling [[Qian (surname)|Qian]] family heavily patronized Buddhist and other religious institutions.

He was born in either the capital city of Wuyue, modern-day [[Hangzhou]], or a suburb of it, [[Yuhang District|Yuhang]], in the year 904. He would have served as an official before becoming a monk, although the exact nature of the position is disagreed upon in biographical sources. He probably became a monk around 932 under the [[Zen]] teacher Ts'ui Yen. At some point he left his initial teacher and went to [[Tiantai Mountain|Mount Tiantai]], where his attainment was confirmed by the teacher Tiantai Dehshao. Around 952 he again moved, this time to Mount Xuědòu (雪窦山), where he served as a teacher and apparently attracted many students. He is said to have practiced [[Buddhist chant|seated chanting]] and [[Zazen|silent meditation]].

In 960, the King of Wuyue, [[Qian Chu]], assigned Yanshou to be the abbot of [[Lingyin Temple]], which the king had recently re-established. Only a year later in 961, the king relocated Yanshou to the newly constructed [[Jingci Temple|Yongming Temple]], from which he would take his name. Here Yanshou is said to have become very prominent. He received gifts from the King of Korea, [[Gwangjong of Goryeo]], and in return he ordained 36 Korean monks, who then returned home to teach. In 974 he returned to Mount Tiantai, and the following year he died.&lt;ref name=WelDis/&gt;

==Teachings and influence==
Yongming Yanshou is best known for attempting to synthesize the diverse and seemingly contradictory teachings of the various schools of Buddhism that existed in China. He is often associated with [[Pure Land Buddhism]] and [[Zen]], but Pure Land largely formed after his lifetime, and he is largely concerned with [[Hua Yan]] in his writings, equating Hua Yan as when the teachings on the One Mind relies on doctrine (Yi Jiao) and these teachings are in the form of Chan when this Mind is directly revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Zongmi on Chan&lt;/ref&gt;
Because he held views that conflicted with the [[Rinzai]] tradition, which came to be the dominant school of [[Japanese Zen]], he has been criticized or marginalized in many later accounts of Zen history. As a result of this, he was largely ignored by Western scholars of Chan in the 20th century, most of whom worked from a Japanese perspective. Nonetheless, recent Western scholarship recognizes his importance, and he has been an enduring influential figure in the eyes of [[Chinese Chán|Chinese]], Korean, and Vietnamese branches of Zen, and he is deeply revered in the Pure Land school.&lt;ref name=Heine_Wright&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-536764-5 | editor1 = Steven Heine | editor2 =  Dale Wright | title = Zen Masters | year = 2010 | last=Welter | first=Albert |contribution=Yongming Yanshou: Scholastic as Chan Master | pages = 59–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

See also the clarify reason in the Background section. |date=February 2018}} is a [[Chinese-culture]] concept traditionally used to indicate that something has gone wrong in [[Chinese spiritual world concepts|spiritual]] or [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]] training. The qigong community uses this term to describe a physiological or [[psychological disorder]] believed to result during or after [[qigong]] practice, due to "improper practice" of qigong and other self-cultivation techniques. The concept was highlighted in the social and political context of [[Qigong fever|mass popularization of qigong in China]].

==Background==

The Chinese word ''zǒuhuǒrùmó'' ({{zh|c=走火入魔}} "①be obsessed with sth. ②possessed by the Devil") combines ''zǒuhuǒ(r)'' ("①〈elec.〉 ⓐspark ⓑhave a short circuit ②〈coll.〉 discharge (a firearm) accidentally ③overstate ④catch fire; be on fire") and ''rùmó'' ("①be spellbound ②be infatuated/obsessed").&lt;ref&gt;Translation equivalents from [[Wenlin]], Version 4.2.2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times this syndrome has been known as {{clarify|text=''qìgōngpiānchā'' ({{zh|t=氣功偏差}} "qigong deviation/error").|reason=This second term is different than the second term used in the intro originally. Copied this term to the intro and also requested clarification there. |date=February 2018}}{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The term has traditionally been applied to indicate that something has gone wrong in one's martial arts training, interpreted as "imbalance of qi (life energy)". 

In more recent history, the term has been applied to refer to undesirable somatic or psychological effects experienced during or after the practice of the broad range of Chinese self-cultivation exercises known as [[qigong]].&lt;ref name=Nancy3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shan/&gt; Most cases do not last for an extended period of time, and are never brought to medical attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sing|title=Cultures in psychiatric nosology: the CCMD-2-R and international classification of mental disorders|journal=Cult Medicine Psychiatry|date=December 1996|volume=20|issue=4|pages=421–472|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00117087|accessdate=2013-05-14|doi=10.1007/bf00117087}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

While qigong could potentially act as a stressor in some vulnerable individuals, relations between qigong and disorders are manifold, and causal relationships have not been demonstrated.&lt;ref name=Ng1998&gt;Ng BY. 1998. "Qigong-induced mental disorders: a review." ''[[Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry]]'' 33(2):197-206.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar syndromes have been observed in other forms of self-cultivation practices such as [[yoga]] ([[Kundalini syndrome]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Upadhyaya |first= Pt.Rajnikant | year=2006|date= |title= Awake Kundalini | publisher= Lotus Press | isbn=81-8382-039-5
| pages = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[meditation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Nelson  |first= James M. | year=2009 |date= |title= Psychology, Religion, and Spirituality | publisher= Springer | isbn=0-387-87572-7 | pages = 470}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hypnosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Gibson  |first= Hamilton Bertie | year=1991 |date= |title= Hypnosis in therapy  | publisher= [[Psychology Press]] | isbn=0-86377-155-6 | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==

Symptoms are often identified as being in one of three categories: 
# panic, discomfort, and uncontrolled spontaneous movement;
# sensory problems, such as visual or auditory hallucination; and 
# irrational beliefs.&lt;ref name=Nancy3 &gt;{{cite book|last= Chen |first=Nancy N. | year=2003|date= |title= Breathing spaces: qigong, psychiatry, and healing in China |publisher= [[Columbia University Press]]  |isbn=0-231-12804-5 | chapter=Chapter 4.

Somatic symptoms can include sensations and pain in head, chest and back, abdomen, limbs, or whole body; whereas, mental and emotional symptoms can include [[neurasthenia]], [[affective disorder]], [[self-consciousness]], [[hallucination]], and [[paranoia]].&lt;ref name=Liu2013CMQ /&gt;{{rp|165–167}}

==Diagnosis==
While the Chinese Society of Psychiatry prefers the term "qigong deviation", the American Psychiatric Association uses psychosis terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Liu | first1 = Lydia He | title = Tokens of exchange: the problem of translation in global circulations | year = 1999 | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] | location = [[Durham, North Carolina]]  | isbn = 978-0-8223-2424-9 | pages =315 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TItoIpT8hFcC&amp;pg=PA315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some physicians believe that this disease can be categorized as a [[culture-bound syndrome]], but this point is debated.&lt;ref name=Shan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shan|first=HH|title=Culture-bound psychiatric disorders associated with qigong practice in China|journal=Hong Kong J Psychiatry|year=2000|pages=10–14|url=http://easap.asia/journal_file/0004_Culture_bound%2012_14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese psychiatry===
In the second edition of the [[Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders]] (CCMD-2) published by the [[Chinese Society of Psychiatry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = The Chinese Society of Psychiatry | title = 66. Qigong deviation syndrome | journal = Chinese Classification and diagnostic criteria of mental disorders (CCMD-2) | volume = CCMD-2  | location = Beijing | year = 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the diagnosis of “Qigong Deviation Syndrome” is based upon the following criteria:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | author = [[Human Rights Watch]] | title = Dangerous minds: political psychiatry in China today and its origins in the Mao era | year = 2002 | publisher = Human Rights Watch  | location = [[New York, New York]]  | isbn = 978-1-56432-278-4 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The subject being demonstrably normal before doing qigong exercises
* Psychological and physiological reactions appearing during or after qigong exercises (suggestion and autosuggestion may play an important role in these reactions)
* Complaints of abnormal sensations during or after qigong exercises
* Diagnostic criteria do not meet other mental disorders such as [[schizophrenia]], [[affective disorder]], and [[neurosis]].

===Western psychiatry===

In [[East-West dichotomy|the West]], there was no equivalent experience until the adoption of qigong practices by the public became more common. When the Western medical community encountered abnormal conditions presenting in patients practicing qigong, they used the term "Qi-gong psychotic reaction" and classified the disorder as a [[culture-bound syndrome]] in the 4th edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (DSM-IV) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].

In order to diagnose this disease in the West, practitioners determine the cultural formation of the patient; this includes their cultural reference group and how that culture might explain their illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hwang|first=Wei-Chin|title=Qi-gong Psychotic Reaction in a Chinese American Woman|journal=Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry|date=1 December 2007|volume=31|issue=4|pages=547–560|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11013-007-9065-z|accessdate=2013-05-14|doi=10.1007/s11013-007-9065-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[DSM-IV codes|DSM-IV classification]] has been criticized by other Western psychiatrists on the grounds that

''{{Quote|text=[i]t is not clear how the architects of the DSM-IV can logically defend labeling a syndrome as aberrant in the context of a diagnostic system while simultaneously placing that syndrome outside of conventional Western [[nosologic]] categories that serve as basis for determining whether a syndrome is or is not aberrant and therefore a disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Robinson | first1 = Bruce H. | title = Biomedicine: A Textbook for Practitioners of Acupuncture  &amp; Oriental Medicine | year = 2007 | publisher = Blue Poppy Press | location =  | isbn = 978-1-891845-38-3 | page = 434 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=bL4X1HiasqEC&amp;pg=PG434 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}''

==Medical causes==

The appearance of symptoms during or after qigong practice has been explained in various ways by the psychiatric community, in severe cases as an indication of latent [[psychosis]]. The Chinese medical literature includes a wider variety of symptoms associated with qigong deviation; the non-psychotic symptoms correspond to [[conversion disorder]] and [[histrionic personality disorder]] in Western classifications.&lt;ref name=rob435/&gt;

===Latent psychosis===
In cases of psychosis, a Western psychiatric belief is that qigong could be a precipitating stressor of a latent psychotic disorder to which the patient is predisposed, rather than erroneous qigong practice;&lt;ref name=rob435&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Robinson | first1 = Bruce H. | title = Biomedicine: A Textbook for Practitioners of Acupuncture  &amp; Oriental Medicine | year = 2007 | publisher = Blue Poppy Press | location =  | isbn = 978-1-891845-38-3 | page = 435 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=bL4X1HiasqEC&amp;pg=PG435 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a type of reactive psychosis or the precipitation of an underlying mental illness, such as [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]], or [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sing, Lee, &amp; Kleinman, Arthur | url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/reprint/30/1/120.pdf | title=Psychiatry in its Political and Professional Contexts: A Response to Robin Munro |journal=J Am Acad Psychiatry Law |volume=30:120–5 |year=2002 |page= 122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qigong community perspective==

Within the qigong community, Zou huo ru mo is believed to be caused by improper practice:&lt;ref name=Xu&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Xu | first1 = Xiangcai |  title = Qigong for Treating Common Ailments | year = 2000 | publisher = YMAA Publication Center | location =  | isbn = 978-1-886969-70-4 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inexperienced or unqualified instructor
* Incorrect instructions
* Impatience
* Becoming frightened, irritated, confused, or suspicious during the course of qigong practice
* Inappropriate focus, interpreted as "inappropriate channeling of qi (life energy)."

===Treatment===
Within the qigong community, there are specific treatments believed to be effective for addressing different forms of Zou huo ru mo.&lt;ref name=Xu /&gt; In particular, depending upon somatic versus psychological symptoms, and whether the condition is considered temporary or an intrinsic mental disorder, self-correction treatments can involve relaxation, walking, self-vibrating, self-patting, and self-massage. Clinical treatments can involve psychological counseling, expert guidance of practice, acupuncture, massage, "external qi" treatments, and symptomatic correction.&lt;ref name=Liu2013CMQ&gt;{{cite book|editor-last= Liu |editor-first=Tian Jun|editor-last2= Qiang |editor-first2=Xiao Mei | year=2013|title= Chinese Medical Qigong, Third Edition|publisher= Singing Dragon |isbn=978-1848190962}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|164–173}}

==Social and political context==

Qigong deviation became part of political controversy during the 1990s, when the [[Chinese government (disambiguation)|Chinese government]] became concerned about loss of state control due to [[Qigong fever|widespread popularity of qigong]], mass practice, and rise to power of charismatic qigong "grandmasters".&lt;ref name = Nancy3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownby&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ownby | first1 = David | title = Falun Gong and the future of China | year = 2008 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = [[Oxford]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]  | isbn = 978-0-19-532905-6 | pages = 181–186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
