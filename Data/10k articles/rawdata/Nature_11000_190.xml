The '''717th Tank Battalion''' was an [[Independent tank battalion]] which fought in the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European Theater of Operations]] during World War II. They were attached to the [[79th Infantry Division (United States)|79th Infantry Division]].

The Battalion entered the war against Germany [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|during its final stages]], with its first shot in combat during the crossing of the Rhine River on 24 March 1945.

A [[nymph]] in [[Greek mythology]], '''Adamanthea''' helped raise the infant [[Zeus]] to hide him from his father, [[Cronus]].  Her name comes from the Greek word {{lang|grc|ἀδάμας}} (''adamas''), meaning "untameable" and {{lang|grc|θεά}}, the Greek word for goddess.

==Mythology==
Adamanthea along with the goat-nymph [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]] are revered as the foster mothers of Zeus. Reacting to a [[prophecy]] from his mother [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] that his own offspring would overthrow his supreme position in the pantheon, Cronus swallowed all of his children immediately after birth.  [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], Zeus' mother and Cronus' wife, deceived Cronus by giving him a stone wrapped to look like a baby instead of Zeus, whom she instead gave to Adamanthea to nurse. Since Cronus ruled over the earth, the heavens and the sea, Adamanthea hid Zeus by dangling him on a rope from a tree, suspended between earth, sea and sky, and thus invisible to his father.

'''Biogeology''' is the study of the interactions between the Earth's [[biosphere]] and the [[lithosphere]].&lt;ref name="darwin"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darwincenter.nl/|title=Darwin Center for Biogeology|accessdate=September 16, 2007|publisher=Darwin Center for Biogeology|year=2007|author=Darwin Center for Biogeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogeology examines [[Biotic material|biotic]], [[Hydrology|hydrologic]], and [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] systems in relation to each other, to help understand the Earth's climate, oceans, and other effects on geologic systems.&lt;ref name="ucsb"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geol.ucsb.edu/Research/TopicsInfo/Biogeology.html |title=Biogeology research at UCSB |accessdate=September 16, 2007 |publisher=UCSB Geology |year=2007 |author=UCSB Geology |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810223337/http://www.geol.ucsb.edu/Research/TopicsInfo/Biogeology.html |archivedate=August 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[bacteria]] are responsible for the formation of some [[minerals]] such as [[pyrite]], and can concentrate economically important [[metals]] such as [[tin]] and [[uranium]]. Bacteria are also responsible for the [[chemical compound|chemical composition]] of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], which affects [[weathering]] rates of [[rock (geology)|rock]]s.

Prior to the late [[Devonian period]], there was little plant life beyond [[lichen]]s, and [[bryophyte]]s. At this time large [[vascular plants]] evolved, growing up to {{convert|30|m|ftin|1|sp=us}} in height. These large plants changed the atmosphere, and altered the composition of the [[soil]] by increasing the amount of [[organic matter|organic]] [[carbon]]. This helped prevent the soil being washed away through [[erosion]].

'''Bradyseism''' is the gradual uplift (positive bradyseism) or descent (negative bradyseism) of part of the Earth's surface caused by the filling or emptying of an underground [[magma chamber]] and/or hydrothermal activity, particularly in volcanic [[calderas]].

==Phlegraean Fields==
The area of [[Phlegraean Fields]] (Campi Flegrei), near [[Naples]], is a collapsed [[caldera]], namely a volcanic area formed by several volcanic edifices, which includes the [[Solfatara (volcano)|Solfatara volcano]], well known for its spectacular [[fumaroles]]. Campi Flegrei area is especially noted for bradyseismic uplift and subsidence. The inflation and deflation of this caldera is especially well documented due to its seaside location and a long history of habitation and construction in the area.

In particular, the town of [[Pozzuoli]] features the Roman [[Macellum of Pozzuoli]] in which three  marble columns show bands of boreholes or ''[[Gastrochaenolites]]'' left by marine ''[[Lithophaga]]'' molluscs.  These occur up to 7 metres up the columns, showing how bradyseism in the area lowered the land to at least this depth under the sea and subsequently raised it again.&lt;ref name="Scandone"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scandone|first1=R.|last2=Giacomelli|first2=L.|last3=Speranza|first3=F.F.|editor=De Vivo B.|title=Volcanism in the Campania Plain: Vesuvius, Campi Flegrei and Ignimbrites|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5SwfdvD1-yIC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=14 July 2011|series=Developments in volcanology|volume=9|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-52175-0|pages=7–9|chapter=1. The volcanological history of the volcanoes of Naples: a review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, between 1968 and 1972, the Campi Flegrei area suffered an episode of positive bradyseism and rose by 1.7 metres.  Another rise of 1.8 metres occurred between 1982 and 1984. This correlated with a shallow (4&amp;nbsp;km deep) [[earthquake swarm]] during the same period, which led to the evacuation of 30,000 people due to the perceived risk of imminent eruption.&lt;ref name="Lima"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lima|first=A. |author2=De Vivo B. |author3=Spera F.J. |author4=Bodnar R.J. |author5=Milia A. |author6=Nunziata C. |author7=Belkin H.E. |author8=Cannatelli C.|year=2009|title=Thermodynamic model for uplift and deflation episodes (bradyseism) associated with magmatic–hydrothermal activity at the Campi Flegrei (Italy)|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|publisher=Elsevier|volume=97|pages=44–58|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2009.10.001|url=http://magma.geol.ucsb.edu/papers/bradyESRpaper.pdf|bibcode = 2009ESRv...97...44L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gonâve microplate.png|thumb|right|250px|Mid-Cayman spreading centre as part of the trough, on the western edge of the [[Gonâve Microplate]]. ]]

The '''Cayman Trough''' (also known as the '''Cayman Trench''', '''Bartlett Deep''' and '''Bartlett Trough''') is a complex [[transform fault]] zone [[pull-apart basin]] which contains a small [[Divergent boundary|spreading ridge]], the [[Mid-Cayman Rise]], on the floor of the western [[Caribbean Sea]] between [[Jamaica]] and the [[Cayman Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Einsele, Gerhard| title=Sedimentary Basins: Evolution, Facies, and Sediment Budget| publisher=Springer |edition=2nd |year=2000|page=630 |isbn=978-3-540-66193-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the deepest point in the Caribbean Sea and forms part of the [[tectonics|tectonic]] boundary between the [[North American Plate]] and the [[Caribbean Plate]].  It extends from the [[Windward Passage]], going south of the [[Sierra Maestra]] of [[Cuba]] toward [[Guatemala]]. The transform continues onshore as the [[Motagua Fault]], which cuts across Guatemala and extends offshore under the Pacific Ocean, where it intersects the [[Middle America Trench]] subduction zone.

The relatively narrow trough trends east-northeast to west-southwest and has a maximum depth of {{convert|7686|m}}. Within the trough is a slowly spreading north-south [[Mid-ocean ridge|ridge]] which may be the result of an offset or gap of approximately {{convert|420|km}} along the main fault trace. The Cayman spreading ridge shows a long-term opening rate of {{nowrap|11–12 mm/yr.}}&lt;ref name=DeMets/&gt; The eastern section of the trough has been named the [[Gonâve Microplate]]. The Gonâve plate extends from the spreading ridge east to the island of [[Hispaniola]]. It is bounded on the north by the Oriente and Septentrional fault zones. On the south the Gonâve is bounded by the [[Walton fault zone]], the [[Jamaica]] restraining bend and the [[Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone]]. The two bounding [[strike slip fault]] zones are left lateral. The motion relative to the [[North American Plate]] is {{nowrap|11 mm/yr}} to the east and the motion relative to the Caribbean Plate is {{nowrap|8 mm/yr}}.&lt;ref name=DeMets&gt;{{cite journal| first1=C.|last1=DeMets|first2=M. |last2=Wiggins-Grandison|title=Deformation of Jamaica and motion of the Gonâve microplate from GPS and seismic data |journal=Geophys.

'''Chiquitania''' ("Chiquitos" or "Gran Chiquitania") is a region of [[tropical savanna]]s in the [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz Department]] in eastern [[Bolivia]].

"Chiquitos" is the colonial name for what is now essentially five of the six provinces that make up the Chiquitania, a region in Bolivia's Santa Cruz department. "Chiquitos" refers to a region, not a tribe. One of the many tribes inhabiting Chiquitos were the Chiquitano.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chiquitania.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126022600/http://www.chiquitania.com/ |date=2009-01-26 }}: The two names Chiquitos and Chiquitano should not be confused, the first is a place; that second a tribe.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Chiquitos means "little ones" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. It was chosen by the Spanish [[conquistadores]], when they found the small doors of the Indian huts in the region. Around 20 [[ethnic]] groups live in the Chiquitania.

A notable feature are the 18th century [[Jesuit reductions]] and [[Franciscan]] settlements scattered throughout the region. Six churches still remain in the zone and were selected in 1990 as [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] under the name ''[[Jesuit Missions of the Chiquitos]]''.

==History==
Written records, dating from as early as 1792, describe effects of offshore seeps in the Santa Barbara Channel. Oil and tar "slicks" have long been a trademark of the area.  In 1792, [[Captain Cook]]'s navigator [[George Vancouver]] recorded on passing through the channel:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sailing Directions for the West Coast of North America. Part 1.|last=Imray|first=James|publisher=James Imray, London.|year=1868|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The surface of the sea, which was perfectly smooth and tranquil, was covered with a thick, slimy substance, which when separated or disturbed by a little agitation, became very luminous, whilst the light breeze, which came principally from the shore, brought with it a strong smell of tar, or some such resinous substance.&lt;ref name=PP679&gt;US Geological Survey Professional Paper 679, 1969, ''Geology, Petroleum Development, and Seismicity of the Santa Barbara Channel Region, California.''  [https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp679 Full text and maps online]&lt;/ref&gt;
It had been commonly assumed that the local [[Chumash people|Chumash]] Native Americans used COP seep oil washed up on the beaches to seal their plank canoes and baskets. However, archaeologists assert that the mainland Chumash in fact used asphalt from nearby onshore seeps in beach cliffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnold|first=Jeanne E.|date=|year=1993|title=Chumash Technology: New Discoveries of Uses of Imported Redwood and Asphaltum on the Channel Islands|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Society for California Archaeology|volume=6|pages=277–285|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These seeps must be sourced from a similar subsurface reservoir system, but exposure to oxidation is required to make the material hard and useful.

== Scientific Investigations ==
The location of the COP seep field offshore from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB) has situated it as a natural laboratory for study of the phenomena of oil and gas introduced into the ocean from the sea bed, along with the role of geologic methane from seeps worldwide in the global methane budget. Since the 1990s almost a dozen UCSB researchers along with their graduate students have studied the geology, chemistry, oceanography and ecology of the marine seep system at COP. Many of these studies were in partnership with oil companies including [[Mobil]] and [[Venoco]], which produced oil from reservoirs below the seeps, and the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]] and [[California State Lands Commission]].

=== Mapping and quantification of discharge ===
The marine hydrocarbon seep system comprises a seabed source (vent) of oil and gas bubbles coated with oil, that transit the shallow water column while partially dissolving into the ocean. At the surface, various gases are discharged to the atmosphere and the oil volatilizes as it is transported by currents, leaving a tarry residue at the sea surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luyendyk|first=B. P.|last2=Kennett|first2=J. P.|last3=Clark|first3=J.|date=|year=2005|title=Hypothesis for Increased Atmospheric Methane Input from Hydrocarbon Seeps on Exposed Continental Shelves during Glacial Low Sea Level|url=|journal=Marine and Petroleum Geology|volume=22 |issue=4|pages=591–596|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the sea surface the seeps are marked by oil slicks, and in places, bubble froth. Since the 1970s and later, oil slicks from COP and others in the Santa Barbara Channel have been successfully mapped by remote sensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DiGiacomo|first=Paul M.|last2=Washburn|first2=Libe|last3=Holt|first3=Benjamin|last4=Jones|first4=Burton H.|date=|year=2004|title=Coastal pollution hazards in southern California observed by SAR imagery: stormwater plumes, wastewater plumes, and natural hydrocarbon seeps|url=|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=49| issue = 11–12|pages=1013–1024|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2004.07.016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the COP seeps are characterized by large visible gas bubble plumes they can be detected and mapped by sonar backscatter. The first attempts at this were made by Peter Fischer and colleagues of [[California State University, Northridge]] in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oil and tar seeps, Santa Barbara basin, California, in California offshore gas, oil, and tar seeps|last=Fischer|first=P.

J.|series=Annual Meeting Guidebook, Field Trip 3|location=|pages=17–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They produced reconnaissance level maps of bubble plumes at COP and at other locations in the [[Santa Barbara Channel]]. They noted that because the COP seeps were associated with a producing oil platform then operated by [[ARCO]], continued oil production might result in a decrease in volume of seep discharge.

Scott Hornafius and [[Bruce P. Luyendyk|Bruce Luyendyk]], along with graduate student Derek Quigley made sonar surveys of the COP field two decades later using 50&amp;nbsp;kHz sonar and 3.5&amp;nbsp;kHz sonar equipment that matched that used by Fischer and colleagues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They calibrated the sonar data with seafloor artificial sources to estimate the volume of gas discharge cited above. Using an estimate of the gas/oil ratio along with capture of oil with a floating boom,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clester|first=S. M.|last2=Hornafius|first2=J.

Comparing the surveys made in the mid 1990s with the early 1970s data of Fischer and colleagues they determined that seepage near the producing platform Holly had decreased by half.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This observation was supported by gas capture data recorded by two sea floor tent structures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rintoul|first=B.|date=|year=1982|title=ARCO Caps Santa Barbara Channel seep|url=|journal=Pacific Oil World|volume=74| issue =  11|pages=6–9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that covered one large seepage area.

Surveys continued over the 1990s and 2000s using more sophisticated sonars including [[chirp]] and [[Multibeam echosounder|multibeam]] sonars. These repeat sonar surveys did not detect further decrease in seepage, while during the same period oil production continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leifer|first=I.|last2=Kamerling|first2=M.

[[File:CoandaEffekt2.jpg|thumb|A spinning ping pong ball is held in a diagonal stream of air by the Coandă effect. The ball "sticks" to the lower side of the air stream, which stops the ball from falling down. The jet as a whole keeps the ball some distance from the jet exhaust, and gravity prevents it from being blown away.]]

The '''Coandă effect''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɑː|n|d|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|æ|-}}) is the tendency of a [[fluid]] [[Jet (fluid)|jet]] to stay attached to a convex surface. As described by the eponymous [[Henri Coandă]] in different patents:  "the tendency of a jet of fluid emerging from an orifice to follow an adjacent flat or curved surface and to entrain fluid from the surroundings so that a region of lower pressure develops." The pressure effect, which is usually not indicated, is fundamental for the comprehension of the Coandă effect.&lt;ref&gt;Tritton, D.J., Physical Fluid Dynamics, Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1977 (reprinted 1980), Section 22.7, The Coandă Effect.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Coanda%20effect&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle was named after [[Romanian people|Romanian]] aerodynamics pioneer Henri Coandă, who was the first to recognize the practical application of the phenomenon in aircraft development.&lt;ref&gt;"The Coanda effect is a phenomenon that was first observed in 1910 by a mathematician and engineer named Henri Coandă. He discovered that when air was ejected from a rectangular nozzle, it would attach itself to an inclined flat plate connected to the nozzle exit. Emphasizing the need for a sharp angle between the nozzle and the flat plate, Coandă then applied the principle to a series of deflecting surfaces, each at a sharp angle to the previous one, and succeeded in turning flows through angles as large as 180. He stated that "when a jet of fluid is passed over a curved surface, it bends to follow the surface, entraining large amounts of air as it does so," and this phenomenon has become known as the ''Coandă Effect''. ''On Some Recent Applications of the Coanda Effect'' Caroline Lubert International Journal of Acoustics and Vibration, Vol. 16, No. 3, 2011 http://www.iiav.org/ijav/content/volumes/16_2011_1739941303237209/vol_3/237_firstpage_856831320254369.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coandă effect. (2013). ''[[Columbia Encyclopedia|Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia]]'', 6th Edition. Digital version available here: http://www.answers.com/topic/coanda-effect archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118131611/http://www.answers.com/topic/coanda-effect archivedate=2012-01-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
An early description of this phenomenon was provided by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in a lecture given to [[The Royal Society]] in 1800:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The lateral pressure which urges the flame of a candle towards the stream of air from a blowpipe is probably exactly similar to that pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle. Mark the dimple which a slender stream of air makes on the surface of water. Bring a convex body into contact with the side of the stream and the place of the dimple will immediately
show the current is deflected towards the body; and if the body be at liberty to move in every direction it will be urged towards the current...&lt;ref&gt;
The pressure of the air jet is actually supplementing the pressure of the atmosphere, a.k.a. The Atmospheric Press, which at 14.7psi at sea level makes water or other liquids lay smooth. Blow on a part of the water and the pressure is increased a slight amount which naturally makes the water move away.   Direct a flame parallel over a liquid or submerge a candle almost to its wick and the liquid will be seen to rise slightly as the heat of the flame lessens the Atmospheric Press pressing on the water.
The hotter the flame and the closer to the surface the greater the effect will be seen.

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A hundred years later, Henri Coandă identified an application of the effect during experiments with his [[Coandă-1910]] aircraft, which mounted an unusual engine he designed. The motor-driven turbine pushed hot air rearward, and Coandă noticed that the airflow was attracted to nearby surfaces. In 1934 Coandă obtained a patent in [[France]] for a "method and apparatus for deviation of a fluid into another fluid." The effect was described as the "deviation of a plain jet of a fluid that penetrates another fluid in the vicinity of a convex wall." The first official documents that explicitly mention the Coandă effect were two 1936 patents by Henri Coandă.&lt;ref&gt;Coanda, H. "US Patent# 2,052,869." Device for Deflecting a Stream of Elastic Fluid Projected into an Elastic Fluid (1936).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coanda H. (1936a), US Patent n. 3,261,162, Lifting Device Coanda Effect, USA&lt;/ref&gt; This name was accepted by the leading aerodynamicist [[Theodore von Kármán]], who had with Coandă a long scientific relationship on aerodynamics problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Eisner|first=Thomas|title=For Love of Insects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ki9djoKOm-0C&amp;pg=PA177|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-01827-3|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coanda effect 6.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A diagram of a generic engine that harnesses the Coandă Effect to generate lift (or forward motion if tilted 90° on its side). The engine is approximately bullet or inverted bowl shaped, with fluid being expelled horizontally from a circular slit near the top of the bullet. A small step at the lower edge of the slit ensures that a low pressure vortex develops immediately below the point where the fluid exits the slit (see image 5 in the illustration on the left). From there on the Coandă effect causes the sheet of fluid to cling to the curved outer surface of the engine. The entrainment of the ambient fluid into the stream flowing over the bullet, causes a low pressure area above the bullet (see images 1-5 on the left) . This, together with the ambient ("high") pressure below the bullet causes lift, or, if mounted horizontally, forward motion in the direction of the apex of the bullet.&lt;ref name=Reba /&gt;]]

A jet of air will entrain molecules of air from its immediate surroundings, causing a "tube," or "sleeve," of low pressure around the jet (see image 1 in the diagram on the left). Ambient air from around this tube of low pressure will exert a force on the jet, which, when seen in cross section, is equal in all directions. The jet will therefore not deviate from moving in a straight line. However, if a solid surface is placed close, and approximately parallel, to the jet (see image 2 in the diagram on the left), the entrainment (and therefore removal) of air from between the solid surface and the jet causes a reduction in air pressure on that side of the jet that cannot be neutralized as rapidly as the low pressure region on the "open" side of the jet. The pressure difference across the jet causes the jet to deviate towards the nearby surface, and then to adhere to it (image 3 on the left).&lt;ref name=Reba /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thermofluids&gt;[http://www.thermofluids.co.uk/effect.php Coanda Effect] Retrieved 17 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The jet will then adhere to the surface even if it is curved (image 4 on the left), because each (infinitesimally small) incremental change in direction of the surface will bring about the effects described for the initial bending of the jet towards the surface.&lt;ref name=Thermofluids /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://karmak.org/archive/2003/02/coanda_effect.html Jeff Raskin: Coanda Effect: Understanding how wings work.] Retrieved 17 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; If the surface is not too sharply curved, the jet can, under the right circumstances, adhere to the surface even after flowing 180° round a cylindrically curved surface, and therefore be traveling in a direction opposite to its initial direction. The forces that cause these changes in the direction of flow of the jet cause an equal and opposite force on the surface along which the jet flows.&lt;ref name=Thermofluids /&gt; These Coandă effect induced forces can be harnessed to cause lift and other forms of motion, depending on the orientation of the jet and the surface to which the jet adheres.&lt;ref name=Reba&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reba |first1=Imants |date=June 1966 |title=Applications of the Coanda effect|journal= Scientific American|volume=214 |issue=6 |pages=84–921 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0666-84|bibcode=1966SciAm.214f..84R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small "lip" on the surface at the point where the jet starts to flow over that surface (see image 5 in the diagram on the left), enhances the initial deviation of the direction of flow of the jet, and its subsequent adherence to the surface. This results from the fact that a low pressure vortex forms behind the lip, promoting the dip of the jet towards the surface.&lt;ref name=Reba /&gt;

The Coandă effect can be induced in any fluid, and is therefore equally effective in water as in air.&lt;ref name=Reba /&gt;

==Conditions of existence==

Early sources provide information, both  theoretical and experimental, needed to derive by comparison a detailed explanation of the Coandă effect and its limits. Coandă effect may occur along a curved wall either in a ''free jet'' or a ''wall jet''.

On the left image of the preceding section: "The mechanism of Coanda effect", the effect as described, in the terms of T. Young as "the lateral pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle", represents a ''free jet'' emerging from an orifice and an obstacle in the surroundings. It includes the tendency of a free jet emerging from an orifice to entrain fluid from the surroundings confined with limited access, without developing any region of lower pressure when there is no obstacle  in the surroundings, as is the case on the opposite side where turbulent mixing occurs at ambient pressure.

On the right image, the effect occurs along the curved wall as a ''wall jet''. The image here on the right represents a ''two dimensional wall jet'' between two parallel plane walls, where the "obstacle" is a quarter cylindrical portion following the flat horizontal rectangular orifice, so that no fluid at all is entrained from the surroundings along the wall, but only on the opposite side in turbulent mixing with ambient air.

1. [[Wall jet]]. To compare experiment with a theoretical model, we first refer to a two-dimensional plane wall jet of width ''h'' along a circular wall of radius ''r''. A wall jet follows a flat horizontal wall, say of infinite radius,or rather  whose radius is the radius of the Earth ''without separation'' because the surface pressure as well as the external pressure in the mixing zone is everywhere equal to the atmospheric pressure and the boundary layer does not separate from the wall.
[[File:Surface pressure of a wall jet along a circular wall.png|thumb|Measurements of surface pressure along a circularly curved wall of radius r = 12 cm, deflecting a [[turbulent]] jet of air ([[Reynolds number]] = 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) of width h. The pressure begins to fall before the origin of the jet, due to local effects at the point of exit of the air from the nozzle which creates the jet. If the h/r ratio (ratio of the width of the jet to the radius of curvature of the wall) is less than 0.5, a true Coandă effect is observed, with the wall pressures along the curved wall remaining at this low (sub-ambient pressure) level until the jet reaches the end of the wall (when the pressure rapidly returns to ambient pressure). If the h/r ratio is more than 0.5, only the local effects occur at the origin of the jet, after which the jet immediately separates from the wall, and there is no Coandă effect. Experiments by M. Kadosch and J. Liermann in  M. Kadosch's  laboratory, SNECMA.&lt;ref name=kadosh /&gt;]]
With a much smaller radius (12 centimeters in the image on the right) a transverse difference arises between external and wall surface pressures of the jet, creating a pressure gradient depending upon ''h/r'', the relative curvature. This pressure gradient can appear in a zone before and  after the origin of the jet where it gradually arises, and disappear at the point  where the jet boundary layer separates from the wall, where the wall pressure reaches atmospheric pressure (and the transverse gradient becomes zero).

Experiments made in 1956 with [[turbulent]] air jets at a [[Reynolds number]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; at various  jet widths ({{mvar|h}}) show the pressures measured along a circularly curved wall (radius {{mvar|r}}) at a series of horizontal distance from the origin of the jet (see the diagram on the right).&lt;ref name=kadosh&gt;Kadosch M., ''Déviation d’un jet par adhérence à une paroi convexe'' in ''Journal de Physique et le Radium'', avril 1958, Paris, pp.1–12A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Gersten&gt;Kadosch M., ''"The curved wall effect"'' in 2nd Cranfield Fluidics Conference, Cambridge, 3 janvier 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

Above a critical {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} ratio of 0.5 only local effects at the origin of the jet are seen extending over a small angle of 18° along the curved wall. The jet then immediately separates from the curved wall. A Coandă effect is therefore not seen here but only a local attachment:  a pressure smaller than atmospheric pressure appears on the wall along a distance corresponding to a small angle of 9°, followed by an equal angle of 9° where this pressure increases up to atmospheric pressure at the separation of the boundary layer, subject to this positive longitudinal gradient. However, if the {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} ratio is smaller than the critical value of 0.5, the lower than ambient pressure measured on the wall seen at the origin of the jet continues along the wall (until the wall ends &amp;mdash; see diagram on the right). This is "a true Coandă effect" as the jet clings to the wall "at a nearly constant pressure" as in a conventional wall jet.

A calculation made by Woods in 1954&lt;ref&gt;L. C. Woods, ''Compressible subsonic flow in two-dimensional channels with mixed boundary conditions'', in ''Quart. Journ. Mech. And Applied Math.'', VII, 3, {{pp.|263–282}}, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; of an [[inviscid]] flow along a circular wall shows that an inviscid solution exists with any curvature {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} and any given deflection angle up to a separation point on the wall, where a singular point appears with an infinite  slope of the surface pressure curve. 
[[File:Pressure distribution along the circular wall of a wall jet.jpg|thumb|Pressure distribution along the circular wall of a wall jet]]

Introducing in the calculation  the angle at separation found in the preceding  experiments for each value of the relative curvature {{math|1=''h''/''r''}}, the image here was recently obtained,&lt;ref&gt;Kadosch M., Illusions créatrices, CreateSpace &amp; Kindle,2015, Ch. 8,  Coandă et le jet qui soulève les aeronefs, {{pp.|91 to 112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shows inertial effects represented by the inviscid solution: the calculated  pressure field is similar to the experimental one described above, outside the nozzle. The flow curvature is caused exclusively by the transverse pressure gradient, as described by T. Young. Then, viscosity only produces a boundary layer along the wall and turbulent mixing with ambient air as in a conventional wall jet—except that this boundary layer separates under the action of the difference between the finally ambient pressure and a smaller surface pressure along the wall. According to Van Dyke,&lt;ref&gt;M. Van Dyke (1969), ''Higher-Order Boundary-Layer Theory'', Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics&lt;/ref&gt; quoted in [[Lift (force)]] Wikipedia article, §10.3, the derivation of his equation (4c) also shows that the contribution of viscous stress to flow turning is negligible.

An alternative way would be to calculate the deflection angle at which the boundary layer subjected to the inviscid pressure field separates. A rough calculation has been tried that gives the separation angle as a function of {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} and the Reynolds number:&lt;ref name = Gersten/&gt; The results are reported on the image, e.g., 54° calculated instead of 60° measured for {{math|1=''h''/''r''=0.25}}. More experiments and a more accurate boundary layer calculation would be desirable.

Other experiments made in 2004 with a wall jet along a circular wall show that Coandă effect does not occur in a [[laminar flow]], and the critical h/r ratios for small Reynolds numbers are much smaller than those for turbulent flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=T. |last1=Vit |first2=F. |last2=Marsik |title=Experimental and Theoretical Study of Heated Coandă Jet |journal=XXI International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics |location=Warsaw, Poland |date=August 15–21, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; down to {{math|1=''h''/''r''=0.14}} if {{math|1=Re=500}} and {{math|1=''h''/''r''=0.05}} if {{math|1=Re=100}}.

2. [[Free jet]]. L. C. Woods also made the calculation of the inviscid two-dimensional flow of  a free jet of width h, deflected round a circularly cylindrical surface of radius r, between a first contact A and separation at B, including a deflection angle θ. Again a solution exists for any value of the relative curvature {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} and angle θ. 
Moreover in the case of a free jet the equation can be solved in closed form, giving the distribution of  velocity along the circular wall. The surface pressure distribution is then calculated using Bernoulli equation. Let us note {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} the pressure and {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} the velocity along the free streamline at the ambient pressure, and γ the angle along the wall which is zero in A and θ in B. Then the velocity {{mvar|v}} is found to be:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v}{v_a} = \exp\bigg[{2h \over\pi r} \tan^{-1}\bigg( \big[{\sinh^2 ({\pi\theta r \over 4h}) - \cosh^2({\pi\theta r \over 4h}) \tanh^2({\pi\gamma r \over 4h})}\big]^{1/2}\bigg)\bigg]&lt;/math&gt;

An image of the surface pressure distribution of the jet round the cylindrical surface using the same values of  the relative curvature h/r, and the same angle θ as those  found for the wall jet reported in the image on the right side here has been established: it may be found in reference (15) p. 104 and both images are quite similar : Coanda effect of  a free jet is  inertial, the same as Coanda effect of a wall jet. However, an experimental measurement of the corresponding surface pressure distribution is not known.

Experiments in 1959 by Bourque and Newmann&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bourque |first1=C. |last2=Newmann |first2=B. G. |title=Reattachment of a two-dimensional, incompressible jet to an adjacent flat Plate |journal=The Aeronautical Quarterly |volume=XI |date=August 1960 |pages=201 ''et seq''}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerning the reattachment of a two-dimensional turbulent jet to an offset parallel plate after enclosing a separation bubble where a low pressure vortex is confined (as in the image 5 in the preceding section) and also for a two-dimensional jet followed by a single flat plate inclined at an angle instead of the circularly curved wall in the diagram on the right here describing the experience of a wall jet: the jet separates from the plate, then curves towards the plate when the surrounding fluid is entrained and pressure lowered, and eventually reattaches to it, enclosing a separation bubble. The jet remains free if the angle is greater than 62°.

In this last case which is the geometry  proposed by Coanda, the claim of the inventor is that the quantity of fluid entrained by the jet  from the surroundings is increased when the jet is deflected, a feature exploited to improve the scavenging of internal combustion engines, and to increase the maximum lift coefficient of a wing, as indicated in the applications below.

The surface pressure distribution as well as the reattachment distance have been duly measured in both cases, and two approximate theories have been developed for the mean pressure within the separation bubble, the position of reattachment and the increase in volume flow from the orifice: the agreement with experiment was satisfactory.

==Applications==
The Coandă effect has important applications in various high-lift devices on [[aircraft]], where air moving over the wing can be "bent down" towards the ground using flaps and a jet sheet blowing over the curved surface of the top of the wing. The bending of the flow results in [[aerodynamic lift]].&lt;ref&gt;"Lift is a force generated by turning a moving fluid." Lift from Flow Turning NASA Glenn Research Center http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/right2.html&lt;/ref&gt; The flow from a high speed jet engine mounted in a [[podded engines|pod]] over the wing produces increased lift by dramatically increasing the velocity [[gradient]] in the [[shear flow]] in the boundary layer. In this velocity gradient, particles are blown away from the surface, thus lowering the pressure there. Closely following the work of Coandă on applications of his research, and in particular the work on his "Aerodina Lenticulară,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phys.ttu.edu/~cmyles/Phys5306/Talks/2004/Fluid%20Dynamics.ppt Fluid Dynamics by Mihaela-Maria Tanasescu, Texas Tech University]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[John Carver Meadows Frost|John Frost]] of [[Avro Canada]] also spent considerable time researching the effect, leading to a series of "inside out" [[hovercraft]]-like aircraft from which the air exited in a ring around the outside of the aircraft and was directed by being "attached" to a flap-like ring.
[[File:Avrocar at factory.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The first Avrocar being readied at the Avro factory in 1958]]
This is as opposed to a traditional hovercraft design, in which the air is blown into a central area, the ''plenum'', and directed down with the use of a fabric "skirt." Only one of Frost's designs was ever built, the [[Avrocar (aircraft)|Avrocar]].

The [[VZ-9 AV Avrocar]] (often listed as '''VZ-9''') was a Canadian [[vertical takeoff and landing|vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL)]] aircraft developed by [[Avro Canada|Avro Aircraft Ltd.]] as part of a secret United States military project carried out in the early years of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Yenne 2003, pp. 281–283.&lt;/ref&gt; The Avrocar intended to exploit the Coandă effect to provide lift and thrust from a single "turborotor" blowing exhaust out the rim of the disk-shaped aircraft to provide anticipated [[VTOL]]-like performance. In the air, it would have resembled a [[flying saucer]]. Two prototypes were built as "proof-of-concept" test vehicles for a more advanced [[USAF|U.S. Air Force]] fighter and also for a [[U.S. Army]] tactical combat aircraft requirement.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;Milberry 1979, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avro's 1956 [[Project 1794]] for the US military designed a larger-scale flying saucer based on the Coandă effect and intended to reach speeds between Mach 3 and Mach 4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/137505-us-air-forces-1950s-supersonic-flying-saucer-declassified, US Air Force's 1950s supersonic flying saucer declassified]&lt;/ref&gt; Project documents remained classified until 2012.
 
The effect was also implemented during the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]'s [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport|AMST]] project. Several aircraft, notably the [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems|Boeing]] [[Boeing YC-14|YC-14]] (the first modern type to exploit the effect), NASA's  [[Quiet Short-Haul Research Aircraft]], and the [[National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan]]'s [[Kawasaki C-1|Asuka]] research aircraft have been built to take advantage of this effect, by mounting [[turbofan]]s on the top of the wings to provide high-speed air even at low flying speeds, but to date only one aircraft has gone into production using this system to a major degree, the [[Antonov]] [[Antonov An-72|An-72 "Coaler."]] The [[Shin Meiwa US-1A]] flying boat utilizes a similar system, only it directs the propwash from its four turboprop engines over the top of the wing to generate low-speed lift. More uniquely, it incorporates a fifth turboshaft engine inside of the wing center-section solely to provide air for powerful [[blown flap]]s. The addition of these two systems gives the aircraft an impressive STOL capability.

Extended slats and flaps are used on commercial aircraft on landing and taking off; but are also used to great effect on fighter aircraft to allow slow airspeeds when necessary. This is not an engineering drawing, but a somewhat exaggerated diagram to emphasize the major points.]]
[[Image:C-17 no169 landing.jpg|thumb|left|300 px|The [[C-17 Globemaster III]] uses the Coandă effect in the same way as the [[Blackburn Buccaneer]] (depicted on the right), but with additional use of the exhaust from the engines over the upper surfaces of the wings to cause lift for a comfortable ride at low flying speeds]]

The [[McDonnell Douglas YC-15]] and its successor, the Boeing [[C-17 Globemaster III]], also employ the effect. The [[NOTAR]] helicopter replaces the conventional [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] tail rotor with a Coandă effect tail (diagram on the left).

An important practical use of the Coandă effect is for inclined [[hydropower]] screens,&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.harc.edu/Documents/EBS/CEDP/HydropowerPart1.pdf Hydropower in the U.S.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621110923/http://files.harc.edu/Documents/EBS/CEDP/HydropowerPart1.pdf |date=2010-06-21 }}, Coandă effect used in debris screen design.&lt;/ref&gt; which separate debris, fish, etc., otherwise in the input flow to the turbines. Due to the slope, the debris falls from the screens without mechanical clearing, and due to the wires of the screen optimizing the Coandă effect, the water flows through the screen to the [[penstock]]s leading the water to the turbines.

The Coandă effect is used in dual-pattern fluid dispensers in automobile windshield washers.&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|4210283|"Dual pattern windshield washer nozzle"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The operation principle of oscillatory flowmeters also relies on the Coandă phenomenon. The incoming liquid enters a chamber that contains two "islands." Due to the Coandă effect, the main stream splits up and goes under one of the islands. This flow then feeds itself back into the main stream making it split up again, but in the direction of the second isle. This process repeats itself as long as the liquid circulates the chamber, resulting in a self-induced oscillation that is directly proportional to the velocity of the liquid and consequently the volume of substance flowing through the meter. A sensor picks up the frequency of this oscillation and transforms it into an analog signal yielding volume passing through.&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer, David W. "Industrial Flow measurement." Instrument Society of America, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[air conditioning]], the Coandă effect is exploited to increase the [[throw (engineering)|throw]] of a ceiling mounted [[diffuser (thermodynamics)|diffuser]]. Because the Coandă effect causes air discharged from the diffuser to "stick" to the ceiling, it travels farther before dropping for the same discharge velocity than it would if the diffuser was mounted in free air, without the neighbouring ceiling. Lower discharge velocity means lower noise levels and, in the case of [[variable air volume]] (VAV) air conditioning systems, permits greater [[turndown ratio]]s. [[Linear diffuser]]s and [[slot diffuser]]s that present a greater length of contact with the ceiling exhibit a greater Coandă effect.

In [[cardiovascular medicine]], the Coandă effect accounts for the separate streams of blood in the [[fetal]] right [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashrafian H. The Coandă effect and preferential right atrial streaming.
Chest. 2006 Jul;130(1):300.&lt;/ref&gt; It also explains why eccentric [[mitral regurgitation]] jets are attracted and dispersed along adjacent left atrial wall surfaces (so called "wall-hugging jets" as seen on echocardiographic color-doppler interrogation). This is clinically relevant because the visual area (and thus severity) of these eccentric wall-hugging jets is often underestimated compared to the more readily apparent central jets. In these cases, volumetric methods such as the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method are preferred to quantify the severity of [[mitral regurgitation]].

In medicine, the Coandă effect is used in ventilators.&lt;ref&gt;http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/100/6/859.full&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fluidic+ventilator&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japi.org/june_2009/16_MP_Anaestheisa_and_Critical_Care.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[meteorology]], the Coandă effect theory has also been applied to some air streams flowing out of mountain ranges such as the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and [[Transylvanian Alps]], where effects on agriculture and vegetation have been noted. It also appears to be an effect in the [[Rhone Valley]] in France and near [[Big Delta]] in Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, B.D. Fluidics, The Coandă Effect, and some orographic winds. Arch.Met.Geoph.Biokl. Ser.A. 25, 1977, 273–279&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Formula One]] automobile racing, the Coandă effect has been exploited by the McLaren, Sauber, Ferrari and Lotus teams, after the first introduction by Adrian Newey (Red Bull Team) in 2011, to help redirect exhaust gases to run through the rear diffuser with the intention of increasing downforce at the rear of the car.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.formula1.com/news/technical/2012/0/939.html Formula 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to changes in regulations set in place by the [[FIA]] from the beginning of the [[2014 Formula One season]], the intention of redirecting exhaust gases to use the Coandă effect have been negated, due to the mandatory requirement that the car exhaust must not have bodywork directly behind the exit for use of aerodynamic effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/12877/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fluidics]], the Coandă effect was used to build [[bistable multivibrator]]s, where the working stream (compressed air) stuck to one curved wall or an other and control beams could switch the stream between the walls.

The Coandă effect is also used to mix two different fluids in a '''Coandă effect mixer'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hong|first=Chien-Chong|last2=Choi|first2=Jin-Woo|last3=Ahn|first3=Chong H.|date=2004|title=A novel in-plane passive microfluidic mixer with modified Tesla structures|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b305892a|journal=Lab on a Chip|volume=4|issue=2|pages=109|doi=10.1039/b305892a|issn=1473-0197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hong|first=Chien-Chong|title=A Novel In-Plane Passive Micromixer Using Coanda Effect|date=2001|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-010-1015-3_11|work=Micro Total Analysis Systems 2001|pages=31–33|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401038935|access-date=2018-08-10|last2=Choi|first2=Jin-Woo|last3=Ahn|first3=Chong H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical demonstration ==
The Coandă effect can be demonstrated by directing a small jet of air upwards at an angle over a ping pong ball. The jet is drawn to and follows the upper surface of the ball curving around it, due to the (radial) acceleration (slowing and turning) of the air around the ball. With enough airflow, this change in [[momentum]] is balanced by the equal and opposite force on the ball supporting its weight.  This demonstration can be performed using a vacuum cleaner if the outlet can be attached to the pipe and aimed upwards at an angle.

A common misconception is that Coandă effect is demonstrated when a stream of tap water flows over the back of a spoon held lightly in the stream and the spoon is pulled into the stream (for example, Massey in "Mechanics of Fluids"&lt;ref&gt;"Mechanics of Fluids, 4th edition 1979, Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York, {{ISBN|0-442-30245-2}}, Fig, 3.12&lt;/ref&gt; uses the Coandă effect to explain the deflection of water around a cylinder). While the flow looks very similar to the air flow over the ping pong ball above (if one could see the air flow), the cause is not really the Coandă effect. Here, because it is a flow of water into air, there is little entrainment of the surrounding fluid (the air) into the jet (the stream of water). This particular demonstration is dominated by [[surface tension]]. (McLean in "Understanding Aerodynamics"&lt;ref&gt;"Understanding Aerodynamics Arguing from the Real Physics" Doug McLean, 2013, John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. Chichester, {{ISBN|978-1-119-96751-4}}, Figure 7.3.6&lt;/ref&gt; states that the water deflection "actually demonstrates molecular attraction and surface tension.")

Another demonstration is to direct the air flow from, e.g., a vacuum cleaner operating in reverse, tangentially past a round cylinder. A waste basket works well. The air flow seems to "wrap around" the cylinder and can be detected at more than 180° from the incoming flow. Under the right conditions, flow rate, weight of the cylinder, smoothness of the surface it sits on, the cylinder actually moves. Note that the cylinder does not move directly into the flow as a misapplication of the Bernoulli effect would predict, but at a diagonal.

The effect can also be seen by placing a can in front of a lit candle. If one blows directly at the can, the air bends around it and extinguishes the candle.

==Problems caused==
The engineering use of Coandă effect has disadvantages as well as advantages.

In marine propulsion, the efficiency of a [[propeller]] or [[Bow thruster|thruster]] can be severely curtailed by the Coandă effect. The force on the vessel generated by a propeller is a function of the speed, volume and direction of
the water jet leaving the propeller. Under certain conditions (e.g., when a ship moves through water) the Coandă effect changes the direction of a propeller jet, causing it to follow the shape of the ship's [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]. The side force from a [[bow thruster|tunnel thruster]] at the bow of a ship decreases rapidly with forward speed.&lt;ref&gt;
This problem can be solved by an accurate design of both the propeller and the hull that is specifically optimized on a fluiddynamic point of view.

If the Coandă effect is applied to symmetrically shaped nozzles, it presents resonation problems. Those problems and how different spins couple has been analyzed in depth.&lt;ref name="Das, Shyam S. 2015"/&gt;

'''Earth-Two''' is a fictional universe appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. First appearing in ''The Flash'' #123 (1961), Earth-Two was created to explain differences between the original [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] and then-current [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] versions of characters such as [[Flash (comics)|the Flash]], and how the current ([[Earth-One]]) versions could appear in stories with their counterparts. This Earth-Two continuity includes DC Golden Age heroes, including the [[Justice Society of America]], whose careers began at the dawn of [[World War II]], concurrently with their first appearances in comics. Earth-Two, along with the four other surviving Earths of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]], were merged into one in the 1985 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. However, following the events of [[Infinite Crisis]], the Multiverse was reborn, although the subsequent Earth-Two was not the same as its pre-Crisis equivalent.

Following the events of [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]], Earth 2 underwent an additional reiteration. While it still houses a [[Justice Society of America|team of superheroes]], its membership is younger than before. Earth 2 also has a tragic backstory, having been invaded by a horde of alien invaders from [[Apokolips]] five years prior to the reboot, ahead of [[Darkseid]]'s attempted invasion of Prime Earth. In the process, this reality's [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Superman]], [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Batman]] and [[Wonder Woman (Earth-Two)|Wonder Woman]] all died, while its [[Supergirl]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] were swept through a dimensional warp to Prime Earth where they became known as [[Power Girl]] and [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]].

==Publication history==

===Introduction: Flash of two worlds===
[[File:Flash v1 123.jpg|thumb|upright|First appearance of Earth-Two in ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' #123 (September 1961). Art by [[Carmine Infantino]] and [[Murphy Anderson]].]]
Characters from [[DC Comics]] were originally suggestive of each existing in their own world, as superheroes never encountered each other. This was soon changed with alliances being formed between certain protagonists. Several publications, including ''[[All Star Comics]]'' (publishing tales of the [[Justice Society of America]]), ''[[Leading Comics]]'' (publishing tales of the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]) and other comic books introduced a "[[shared universe]]" among several characters during the 1940s. By the 1950s, as the popularity of superheroes was waning, comics shifted to horror, westerns and war. Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman were among the few DC continued to publish.

Beginning in the early 1960s, the popularity of superheroes began to grow. DC introduced more modern versions of its heroes, for example, [[Hawkman]] was an alien policeman instead of a reincarnated Egyptian prince. The older heroes were assigned to an alternative reality earth.

Alternative-reality Earths had been used in DC stories before, but were usually not referred to after that particular story.  Most of these alternative Earths were usually so vastly different that no one would confuse that Earth and its history with the so-called real Earth. That would change when the existence of another reliable Earth was established in a story titled "[[Flash of Two Worlds]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Gardner Fox|Fox, Gardner]]| penciller= [[Carmine Infantino|Infantino, Carmine]]| inker= [[Joe Giella|Giella, Joe]]| story= Flash of Two Worlds!| title= [[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]| issue= 123| date= September 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], the modern Flash later referred to as the Flash of [[Earth-One]] (the setting of the Silver Age stories) first travels to another Earth, accidentally vibrating at just the right speed to appear on Earth-Two, where he meets Jay Garrick, his Earth-Two counterpart. He claims Gardner Fox's dreams were tuned into Earth-Two, explaining their depiction as a fictional world in earlier Barry Allen stories.

===Expanding the concept: revisiting 40s superheroes===
[[Superman (Kal-L)|Superman]] was introduced in the 1930s and was the archetype for the modern superhero, and so is depicted in stories set on Earth-Two as the first major reliable costumed superhero on that world, discounting earlier part-time heroes and "mystery men" such as [[Dr. Occult]]. Most of the following costumed mystery men history is based on the Earth-Two Superman's initial appearance, where these previously independent operating heroes begin to reliably interact. In order to distinguish him from the later primary version of the character, this Superman was called "Kal-L", using the spelling of Superman's Kryptonian name in his early appearances. He was specifically introduced as an Earth-Two character in ''Justice League of America'' #73 (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Dennis O'Neil|O'Neil, Denny]]| penciller= [[Dick Dillin|Dillin, Dick]]| inker= [[Sid Greene|Greene, Sid]]| story= Star Light, Star Bright—Death Star I See Tonight| title= [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]| issue= 73| date= August 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most superheroes from the Golden Age later followed this trend of operating publicly, while wearing distinctive costuming and interacting in a largely shared universe. The primary characters of Superman and Batman still largely worked independent of team environments.

In the 1970s, as the now  annual team up between the [[Justice League of America]] and the [[Justice Society of America]] had proven popular, DC published the then present day adventures of the Justice Society in the revived [[All-Star Comics]] with issue 58, resuming the numbering from the series original run. The story continued in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #460- 465, which featured the death of the Earth-Two Batman. ''Mr and Mrs Superman'', a feature in ''[[Superman Family]]'' (1974–1982), featured stories of the adventures of married Superman and [[Lois Lane]] of Earth-Two. These stories were set at a time in which the Superman of Earth-Two was at a similar age to the then-present-day Superman of Earth-One. In the 1980s,  DC published ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' which covered the war time history of various superheroes during World War II.

''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'', a group made up of the children and heirs of the Justice Society, was introduced in  ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' #25 (September 1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 203 |quote = The children of the original Justice Society of America made their smash debut in this issue by writer Roy Thomas and penciler Jerry Ordway...''All-Star Squadron'' #25 marked the first appearances of future cult-favorite heroes Jade, Obsidian, Fury,&lt;!--Hippolyta "Lyta" Trevor made her first appearance in ''Wonder Woman'' #300 (Feb. 1983), ''All-Star Squadron'' #25 was her first appearance using the name "Fury"--&gt; Brainwave Jr., the Silver Scarab, Northwind, and Nuklon.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an eponymous comics series starring the group,&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 207: "Written by DC's Golden Age guru Roy Thomas and drawn by Jerry Ordway, ''Infinity, Inc.'' was released in DC's new deluxe format on bright Baxter paper."&lt;/ref&gt; which ran from March 1984 through June 1988.

===Abandonment: ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''===
''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (1985–1986) was an effort by DC Comics to clean up their continuity, resulting in the multiple universes combining into one. Since then, a handful of characters originating from Earth-Two have consistently remained part of the merged Earth, including [[Power Girl]], [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], and [[Alan Scott]]. Superman and Lois Lane from Earth-Two (along with [[Superboy-Prime|Superboy]] from [[Earth Prime]], and [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] from [[Earth-Three]]) were transported into a ghost-like "paradise dimension" tangential to the new universe.

Following the end of the known Multiverse, more alternate realities were discovered. Even though Earth-Three was destroyed in the [[Anti-Monitor]]'s anti-matter wave attacks, a new [[Crime Syndicate]] (called the "Crime Syndicate of Amerika") developed in the antimatter universe of [[Qward]], which was very different in background and power base from the pre-''Crisis'' Earth-Three group, though same in the number of members. After the [[The Kingdom (comics)|Kingdom event]], [[Hypertime]] and divergent realities were revealed, but never supposed to be accessed, as stated in the [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] event. They were later revealed when a directly-parallel Flash ([[Wally West#Walter West|Walter West]] aka the "Dark Flash") entered the mainstream DC Universe and threatened to destroy it. These alternate realities are usually addressed as "Elsewhere" and "Elseworld" stories.

===Reviving the Multiverse: ''Infinite Crisis''===
[[File:Crisis5p3.png|upright|Kal-L fighting Kal-El during the brief return of Earth-Two (Art from ''Infinite Crisis'' #5)|thumb]]
Kal-L, Lois Lane-Kent, [[Superboy-Prime]], and Alexander Luthor returned during ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. Unknown to Kal-L, Luthor's plan was to resurrect the pre-''Crisis'' Multiverse. He wanted to mix and match elements from each reality to create a "perfect world". The fallout of the conflict brought the short-lived return of an Earth-Two copy and the deaths of Kal-L, Lois Lane-Kent and Luthor Jr. of Earth-Two. It is unclear what happened to the aged Diana Trevor, the [[Wonder Woman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Wonder Woman]], though she faded from her ghostly existence. Inexplicably, Earth-Two was the only returning world that was devoid of most people, except the Justice Society, Kal-L, and his wife Lois Kent. This world was a copy, new and recently manufactured by [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] of pre-''Crisis'' Earth-Three, instead of resurrected. This copy Earth-Two was recombined with the primary Earth to form the primary DC reality termed as "New Earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Johns|first = Geoff|authorlink = Geoff Johns |author2=Jimenez, Phil |authorlink2=Phil Jimenez |title = [[Infinite Crisis]]|year = 2006|pages = 264| isbn = 1401209599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series, the realigned world is called "New Earth". In the final issue of the ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' weekly series, it is revealed that fifty-two duplicate worlds have been created and all but New Earth have been altered from the original incarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Johns, Geoff; [[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]; [[Greg Rucka|Rucka, Greg]]; [[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]]| penciller= [[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]]; [[Eddy Barrows|Barrows, Eddy]]; [[Chris Batista|Batista, Chris]]; [[Justiniano]]; [[Mike McKone|McKone, Mike]]; [[Pat Olliffe|Olliffe, Patrick]]; [[Darick Robertson|Robertson, Darick]]| inker= [[Drew Geraci|Geraci, Drew]]; Lanning, Andy; [[Rodney Ramos|Ramos, Rodney]]; Robertson, Darick; [[Walden Wong|Wong, Walden]]| story= A Year in the Life| title= [[52 (comics)|52]]| issue= 52| date= May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 made its first appearance in a single panel of ''52'' Week 52 where it resembled the pre-''Crisis'' Earth-Two, where a newspaper article says that this world's [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Superman]] and [[Power Girl]] are missing. The Flashes of New Earth ([[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] and [[Wally West]]) briefly glimpsed this world with [[Robin (comics)#52|Robin]] and [[Huntress (comics)#Other versions|Huntress]] in action (during their travel with the Cosmic Treadmill as shown in Justice Society (vol. 3) #11) and [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]] selected Jay Garrick of this Earth (amongst others) in a [[Countdown: Arena|Multiversal arena tournament]].
Based on comments by ''52'' co-writer [[Grant Morrison]], this alternate universe is not the pre-''Crisis'' Earth-Two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This separation between the pre-''Crisis'' Earth-Two and post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 is formally established in ''Justice Society of America Annual'' #1 (2008), with a story titled "Earth 2 Chapter One: Golden Age", in which the New Earth Power Girl arrives on post-''Crisis'' Earth-2. Thinking that she has returned home to her long destroyed pre-''Crisis'' Earth-Two. Power Girl crash lands and unconscious, on the closest parallel of the 52 Multiverse,  the post-''Crisis'' Earth-2, which appears similar to the pre-''Crisis'' Earth-Two. She is found by the post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Huntress, who thinks she is her long-missing best friend, the Power Girl native to this world. In this new reality, the Justice Society of America has merged with Infinity, Inc. and is now known as Justice Society Infinity. Initially, Power Girl believes she has returned home, until the missing post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Power Girl reappears and declares that the other Power Girl is an impostor, and has caused the disappearance of the post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Superman. This turn of events results in the post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Power Girl and the Justice Society Infinity to go after the New Earth Power Girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/237-jerry-ordway-traveling-back-to-dc-s-earth-2.html |title=Jerry Ordway – Traveling Back to DC's Earth 2 |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |date=June 23, 2008 |publisher=Newsarama |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ISaF0iPV?url=http://www.newsarama.com/237-jerry-ordway-traveling-back-to-dc-s-earth-2.html |archivedate=July 28, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Johns, Geoff|penciller= [[Jerry Ordway|Ordway, Jerry]]|inker= [[Bob Wiacek|Wiacek, Bob]]|story= Earth 2, Chapter One: Golden Age|title= Justice Society of America Annual|issue= 1|date= September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the confrontation, [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]] and [[Jade (comics)|Jade]] are initially confused when they see each other, as the post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Jade's father, Alan Scott, is dead, and New Earth's Jade is dead as well. The JSI interrogate Power Girl for information on the post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Superman's whereabouts. The post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Power Girl assumes that the Superman the New Earth Power Girl said was dead was the post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Superman (rather than Kal-L who was killed by [[Superboy-Prime]]) and that the New Earth Power Girl had killed him. The Justice Society of New Earth arrives to stop her torture.
[[Thom Kallor|Starman]] reveals that the re-creation of the Multiverse led to the creation of a Power Girl and Superman native to this new universe, post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 and that the post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Superman is still alive. The Power Girl of New Earth then returns home along with her Justice Society but with no apology from her counterpart nor from the post-''Crisis'' Earth-2 Huntress for their actions against her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Johns, Geoff; Ross, Alex|penciller= Eaglesham, Dale; Ordway, Jerry|inker= Massengill, Nathan; Wiacek, Bob|story= Earth Bound|title= Justice Society of America|volume= 3|issue= 20|date= December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the Earth-2 concept has been revived and is covered in two series; ''[[Worlds' Finest]]'', which focuses on the adventures of the [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]] and [[Power Girl]] on New Earth written by [[Paul Levitz]], and ''Earth 2'',&lt;!-- NOTE: the title of the comic book series is spelled ''Earth 2'' rather than ''Earth-Two'' per the Grand Comics Database--&gt; originally written by [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson]] and then by [[Tom Taylor (writer)|Tom Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb series|id= 63327|title= Earth 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which features the formation of the Justice Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kushins |first=Josh |title=DC Comics in 2012–-Introducing the "Second Wave" of DC Comics The New 52 |work=The Source |publisher=DC Comics |date=January 12, 2012 |url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2012/01/12/dc-comics-in-2012-–-introducing-the-“second-wave”-of-dc-comics-the-new-52/ |accessdate=January 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64hEz5q0J?url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2012/01/12/dc-comics-in-2012-%E2%80%93-introducing-the-%E2%80%9Csecond-wave%E2%80%9D-of-dc-comics-the-new-52/ |archivedate=January 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; James Robinson, the original writer of Earth 2, describes the new Earth 2 as a complete reboot of the concept, with superheroes only just now appearing, similar to the "young hero" concept for the New 52 continuity,&lt;ref name="earth2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/9164-repost-james-robinson-describes-the-new-52-s-earth-2.html |title=James Robinson Describes the New 52's ''Earth 2'' |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |date=March 5, 2012 |publisher=Newsarama |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ISabigj6?url=http://www.newsarama.com/9164-repost-james-robinson-describes-the-new-52-s-earth-2.html |archivedate=July 28, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and with revamped costume designs.

In ''Earth 2'', Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman seemingly gave their lives in order to repel the [[Apokolips|Apokoliptan]] invasion, leaving behind a world with no heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller= [[Nicola Scott|Scott, Nicola]]|inker= Scott, Trevor|story= The Price of Victory|title= Earth 2|issue= 1|date= July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supergirl and Robin (Helena Wayne) end up stranded in the mainstream universe towards the end of the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer= [[Paul Levitz|Levitz, Paul]]|penciller= [[George Pérez|Pérez, George]]; [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Maguire, Kevin]]|inker= Koblish, Scott|story= Rebirth| title= [[Worlds' Finest]]|issue= 1|date= July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Earth-2 [[Solomon Grundy (comics)#The New 52|Solomon Grundy]] threatens the world, three new heroes team up to defeat him: the [[Flash (Jay Garrick)#The New 52|Flash]] (Jay Garrick), Hawkgirl ([[Hawkgirl#The New 52|Kendra Saunders]]), and [[Alan Scott#The New 52|Green Lantern]] (Alan Scott).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://news.yahoo.com/green-lantern-relaunched-brave-mighty-gay-070052544.html|title= Green Lantern relaunched as brave, mighty and gay|first= Matt|last= Moore|date= June 1, 2012|publisher= [[Yahoo!

Villains include Solomon Grundy, a now-villainous [[Mister Terrific (Terry Sloane)#The New 52|Terry Sloan]], [[Wotan (comics)|Wotan]], [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]] and what was thought to be a surviving, Darkseid-brainwashed [[Superman (Earth Two)|Superman]], which turned out to be a very powerful but genetically unstable [[Bizarro]]-type clone. Writer James Robinson left the series with issue #16 and [[Tom Taylor (writer)|Tom Taylor]] became the new writer at #17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=45574|title= James Robinson Exits ''Earth 2,'' Leaves DC Comics|first= Stephen|last= Gerding|date= May 17, 2013|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6ISduEiD9?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=45574|archivedate= July 29, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= July 28, 2013|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other new characters introduced as the series progresses include a female [[Lois Lane#Red Tornado|Red Tornado]] (with the consciousness of [[Lois Lane]]), a hyper-intelligent knowledge-assimilator known as Accountable ([[Jimmy Olsen]]), a new Batman ([[Thomas Wayne]] using Miraclo), a new version of Aquawoman (Marella), and a new Superman (Val-Zod, a Kryptonian and a childhood friend of Power Girl's who had been imprisoned by Terry Sloan).

Towards the end of the series, Darkseid launches a second invasion of Earth, which is depicted in both ''Earth 2'' and the weekly series ''Earth 2: World's End''. Another weekly series, ''[[The New 52: Futures End]]'', depicts a possible future in which refugees from a destroyed Earth 2 come to Earth 0 and prompt society to fracture. Over the course of the series, several new characters are introduced, such as [[Yolanda Montez]], an Avatar of the Red who is a counterpart of Alan Scott; a second Red Arrow, an Earth 2 equivalent of [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]]; and [[Dick Grayson]], a journalist who goes on a mission to find his son after his wife [[Barbara Gordon]] is killed during the invasion. Others change alignment; Wonder Woman and Steppenwolf's daughter [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]] sides with Mister Miracle and the other heroes after Big Barda reveals her loyalty to Darkseid. Huntress and Power Girl return to Earth 2 as well to take part in a mad scramble to save the Earth and then later, to save its people along with a computerised record of human culture and life on Earth created by Bruce Wayne. In ''Earth 2: World's End'' #11, it is revealed that [[Highfather (comics)|Highfather]] made a deal with [[Darkseid]] that he would not interfere with Darkseid's plans for conquest so long as Darkseid only preyed upon one Earth of the Multiverse, which was Earth 2, explaining the recurrent tragedies faced by this world in comparison to others. In the end, Darkseid is successful, and the Earth is destroyed, and attempts to take Earth 2's refugees to Earth 0 are prevented by a time travelling [[Tim Drake]] in ''Futures End''. Just as the world ends, several of the Wonders are sent to the planet Telos by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], where they confront their counterparts from various parallel worlds, both present and extinct, in the ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' miniseries. Over the course of the series, Batman dies and Dick Grayson, inspired by his Batman counterparts from other worlds, takes up the mantle from Thomas Wayne. Ultimately, the planet Telos is terraformed into a new Earth-like planet and sent to the Earth 2 dimension as a new home for its refugees. The heroes' fraught attempts at forming a new society, rapidly augmented by Terry Sloan's technology, is depicted in the follow-on series ''Earth 2: Society'' (August 2015&amp;nbsp;– March 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb series|id= 89985|title= Earth 2: Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final arc of the series recreates Earth 2 again making it appear similar to their universe's first Earth through use of an Amazon artifact known as Pandora's Casket by [[Ultra-Humanite]]. This Earth has had no history of Wonders with Ultra-Humanite controlling the world behind the scenes. Following Ultra-Humanite's defeat, the Wonders becomes the world's new defenders and hopes that this Earth is the Earth they can protect.

==Characters==
{{main article|List of Earth-Two characters}}

A number of characters, heroes and villains, had counterparts on both Earth-One and Two. Generally speaking, the older Earth-Two versions were phased out or incorporated into their younger, Earth-One versions following ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. Several others were rebooted almost entirely, with their new versions having nothing in common with the old ones. For instance, [[Jim Corrigan#Jim Corrigan (1940s)|'''Jim Corrigan''' of Earth-Two]] was a murdered police detective who served as the human host for the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], while his [[Jim Corrigan#Jim Corrigan (1970s)|Earth-One counterpart]] was a [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] police officer who often assisted ''[[Daily Planet]]'' cub reporter [[Jimmy Olsen]] and superhero [[Black Lightning]]. Many characters would often travel from one Earth to the other and interact with its natives or even immigrate. For example, Larry Jordan, the first [[Air Wave#Larry Jordan|Air Wave]] and native of Earth-Two, traveled to Earth-One under yet-unexplained circumstances, married [[Air Wave#Helen Jordan|Helen]] (the second Air Wave) and raised a son, [[Air Wave#Harold Jordan|Hal]] (the third Air Wave).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer= [[Bob Rozakis|Rozakis, Bob]]|penciller= [[Alex Saviuk|Saviuk, Alex]]|inker= Colletta, Vince|story= Whatever Happened to the Original Air Wave?|title= [[DC Comics Presents]]|issue= 40|date= December 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unique features==
The history of Earth-Two is slightly different from both real world history and the history of other DC continuities. For example, in classic Earth-Two stories, by the 1970s, [[Quebec]] is shown to be an independent nation autonomous from [[Canada]]. [[South Africa]] abolished apartheid sooner than in the real world, Dukalia, Luxor, Napkan, Nastonia, Oxnalia, Thornia and others were on the Axis side in WW2 and in 1941 in Cliffland a part of the city was destroyed in a volcanic eruption, it rained icebergs that destroyed skyscrapers, and the city was flooded with seawater. Unlike other DCU depictions of Atlantis, the Atlantean countries of Poseidonis and Tritonis were ruled by a queen, not a king (along with its inhabitants displaying surface dweller features and no capacity for underwater survival, as the Atlantis continent had been raised).

In addition, masked crimefighters are introduced decades earlier than in other universes later identified within DC Comics, and these participated in such historic conflicts as World War II. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] founded both the Justice Society of America and the [[All-Star Squadron]]. Other events taking place decades earlier include the destruction of Krypton and the advent of advanced technology such as interstellar transportation and time travel.

Thousands of years ago, the [[Guardians of the Universe|Guardians of Earth-One's Universe]] expelled the vast majority of [[magic (fantasy)|magic]] from their universe, sending it to Earth-Two. This resulted in a predominance of magic and a weakening of scientific laws within Earth-Two's universe.

==Variants==
Because Earth-Two as presented didn't match up with the actual comics of DC's Golden Age other alternative Earths were used to explain the discrepancies.  

'''Earth-Two-A''' (also known as Alternate Earth-Two) was where Clark Kent worked for the ''Daily Planet'' under editor Parry White in the 1940s and 1950s (on regular Earth-Two Kent worked for the ''Daily Star'', his editor was George Taylor, and Perry White was a reporter).&lt;ref&gt;''The Official Crisis on Infinite Earths Index'' (March 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth-Two-B (aka '''Earth-Forty-Six''') is a world referenced but not described in the ''Crisis On Infinite Earths: Absolute Edition''.

Earth-E ('''Earth-216''') is the world where the [[Super-Sons]] adventures happened and was used to explain 1950s Batman and Superman stories that didn't fit with either Earth-One or Earth-Two history.  Mark Gruenwald assigned it to the 1951–1960 period of those books.&lt;ref&gt; Mark Gruenwald  "In Search of the Super-Sons Tangent" ''Omniverse'' #1, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===
* The season 3 episode "Tempus Anyone?" in ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', time traveler and author H.G. Wells takes the Lois Lane from Earth-One to a parallel universe Metropolis where there is a Clark Kent, but no Superman.  Here, she inspires him to become the Man of Steel to that world.  She also runs into familiar faces in unfamiliar roles: Jimmy Olsen is now James Olsen, owner of the Daily Planet; Perry White is running for Mayor; Clark Kent is engaged to High School sweetheart Lana Lang (who is keeping him from using his powers); she also realizes that the Lois Lane of that world died a few years earlier when she came upon her tombstone.  Needless to say, by the end of the episode, Earth-Two Clark Kent embraces his destiny as Superman, but loses his identity as Clark. Earth-Two Clark later arrives in Earth-One during the season 4 episode "Lois and Clarks".  This occurs after another encounter with Tempus that has the Earth-One Man of Tomorrow locked away in a moment of time that threatens to erase him from existence.
* The Earth-Two of the ''[[Smallville]]'' series is the home of [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]].
* Another version of Earth-Two is featured in season 2 of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', but it is more of an analogue of Earth-3. While possessing similarities to the 'Prime' Earth, this Earth-Two has several marked differences. The architecture, clothing fashions and entertainments are mixtures of contemporary 21st century and 1940s styles, and certain areas of science and technology are far more advanced than on Earth-One. In addition, people in this Earth-Two are typically opposite in personality and circumstances than their Earth-One doppelgangers. For instance, [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin Snow]] on Earth-One doesn't possess the metahuman gene and is a kind, soft-spoken person, whereas her Earth-Two counterpart is an amoral criminal named Killer Frost who has ice-generating powers. [[Iris West Allen]] is not a reporter on this world; instead, she is a police detective whose father (a cop on Earth-One) is a [[nightclub singer]]. (This aspect is similar to that depicted on the Earth shown in ''[[JLA: Earth 2]]''.) The two earths are originally connected through a wormhole created by [[Eobard Thawne|Eobard Thawne/"Harrison Wells"]] (the Prime Earth Reverse-Flash) in the season 1 finale, demonstrated by the appearance of the Earth-Two Flash's helmet. When the singularity is finally collapsed, the explosion causes 52 breaches throughout Central City that allow passage between the two worlds, but only by speedsters or through tehnological means. Doppelgangers from Earth-Two begin appearing on Earth-One, being forcibly brought by [[Hunter Zolomon|Zoom]], a criminal speedster. Zoom directs these metahumans to kill the Earth-One Flash or be stranded on Earth-One forever. Jay Garrick and the Harrison Wells of Earth-Two arrive separately to help Team Flash with the criminal metahumans and to defeat Zoom. Over time, Wells and Barry discover a way to close off the breaches permanently, and Barry and [[Vibe (comics)|Cisco]] travel to Earth-Two to help rescue Wells' daughter Jessie from Zoom (who was holding her prisoner to blackmail Wells to betray the Flash and steal his speed for Zoom). The final breach to Earth-Two beneath S.T.A.R. labs is then closed, cutting off access to both worlds, but not before Jay Garrick is seemingly killed by Zoom and his body drawn back through the portal. Barry later announces to Team Flash that they are not done with Earth-Two; they will find a way back there, avenge Jay's death, and stop Zoom for good. Later, when Jay is shown to actually be Zoom (his real name being Hunter Zolomon), Barry rededicates himself to returning to Earth-Two and defeating Zoom. After they reopen a breach, Zoom returns and kills Barry's father before setting up a doomsday machine that could set off a chain reaction that destroys the multiverse. Barry stops it, defeats Zoom, and rescues a man Zoom had kept in a glass prison all season, who is revealed to be Jay Garrick, the Flash of Earth-3, showing the show may be swapping Earth-2 and Earth-3 from the comics. During season 3, Savitar attacks Earth Two S.T.A.R. Labs and captures Earth One Iris West.
* Earth-Two of ''The Flash'' is referred to in the ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' crossover episode, "[[Worlds Finest]]". As Barry is explaining the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] to [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara]] and her friends, Winn asks about a possible Earth "where all of us are evil". Barry replies "Been there. It ''sucks''", referring to the Earth-Two he has visited ([[List of The Flash (2014 TV series) episodes|"Welcome to Earth-2/Escape from Earth-2"]]).

===Video games===
* An ''Earth 2'' skin pack was released as downloadable content for ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. It included alternate skins for the Flash, Hawkgirl, and Solomon Grundy based on the appearances of Jay Garrick, Kendra Saunders and Grundy in New 52.
* A pre-order skin pack for ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'' video game includes two Earth 2 skins for Batman, both based on the New 52. One depicts the original Batman Bruce Wayne and the other depicting the new black-and-red Batman Thomas Wayne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alexa Ray |last=Corriea |url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/7/4597178/batman-arkham-origins-skin-pack-adds-alternate-timeline-costumes |title=''Batman: Arkham Origins'' skin pack adds alternate timeline costumes |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=August 7, 2013 |accessdate=August 7, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IhTOfPt6?url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/7/4597178/batman-arkham-origins-skin-pack-adds-alternate-timeline-costumes |archivedate=August 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Chris|last= Begley|url= http://batman-news.com/2013/09/26/batman-arkham-origins-season-pass-announced-new-dlc-skins-revealed/|title= ''Batman: Arkham Origins'' season pass announced, new DLC and skins revealed|publisher= Batman-News.com|date=September 26, 2013|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140606221845/http://batman-news.com/2013/09/26/batman-arkham-origins-season-pass-announced-new-dlc-skins-revealed/|archivedate= June 6, 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate= October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3711">'''The Earth Science Education Unit (ESEU)''' develops and provides continuous professional development (CPD) workshops and resources for teachers and trainee teachers in [[Earth science]] Education across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthscienceeducation.com "The Earth Science Education Unit"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ESEU was first set up in 2002 with funding from the UK Offshore Operators Association (UKOOA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oilandgasuk.co.uk/news/news.cfm/newsid/127 "Training Scheme Takes Earth-y Approach to Teaching Skills"]&lt;/ref&gt; initially providing workshops in England and Scotland for secondary teachers. In January 2003, ESEU launched workshops in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keele.ac.uk/news/week/archive/2003/0131/0131-04.htm "ESEU - Launching Into Wales"]&lt;/ref&gt;  A second lot of funding from Oil and Gas UK, the umbrella organisation for the Oil and Gas industry in the UK, through OPITO, the Oil and Gas Academy, was secured in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opito.com/uk/component/content/article/21-education-and-industry-skills/325-education-activities.html "OPITO Education activities"]&lt;/ref&gt; enabling ESEU to develop primary workshops in England and Wales at Key Stage 2 in 2009 and to launch new workshops in Scotland, written specially for the Curriculum for Excellence in 2010.

==Workshops==
ESEU provides workshops at [[Key Stage]]s 2, 3 and 4, and for the Scottish [[Curriculum for Excellence]], to teachers and to trainee teachers. Workshop fees are not paid for by the school or university but by ESEU. A team of 46 facilitators are spread across the UK and travel to schools to give workshops, taking rock samples and other equipment with them.

Practical, hands on activities are used in the workshops, which use simple, easily available and cheap materials, such as party poppers, Potty Putty and Slinky springs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/resource/steal-the-show "'Flash bang demos' steal the show"]&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as activities for use in the classroom, ESEU also encourages teachers to make the most of the outdoor environment as a teaching resource, using a gradual approach, starting by using the view from a classroom window, then the school grounds, a local graveyard or building stones in the local town and finally any local quarry or outcrop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ase.org.uk/htm/members_area/journals/ssr/ssr_march-06/putting-53-060.pdf "Putting earth science teaching into its outdoor context"]&lt;/ref&gt;

ESEU workshops were found to have a long-term impact on those involved, even though the workshops only last for 90 minutes. This may be due to the practical and interactive activities which are used as the main part of the workshops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a908529094~db=all~jumptype=rss "Can a single, short continuing professional development workshop cause change in the classroom?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resources==
ESEU also provides online resources, including a virtual rock kit, Scottish virtual activities and a rock reference sheet as well as videos of salol crystallising at different rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthscienceeducation.com/resources/index.htm "ESEU Resources"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecotivity''' is an abbreviation, or blend, of the term, '''ecological activity'''.  An ecotivity is any activity that promotes the conservation or sustainability of [[ecosystems]] and [[bio-diversity]].

In more general terms, an ecotivity can be thought of as any ecologically friendly activity.  Ecotivities therefore make a positive contribution to averting the environmental crisis of the planet or means of effecting positive change.

Ecotivities include all associated values, actions, and choices either as a green consumer, or as an individual living a sustainable lifestyle, for example, by [[recycling]] or energy efficiency.  Ecotivity can also be of political, [[direct action]], hand-on [[environmental conservation]], and creative confrontational acts, that are a means to protect the environment.

== Types of ecotivity ==

* [[recycling]]
* energy conservation
* use of [[renewable energy]]
* [[ecotourism]]
* [[simple living]] / sustainable living
* use of alternative transport
* [[organic farming]] and other [[sustainable agriculture]]
* [[guerrilla gardening]] or [[permaculture]]
* [[Responsible Volunteering|conservation]] volunteering
* [[green politics]]
* eco blogging
* [[ecoterrorism]]
* green or [[environmental consumerism]]
* environment education &lt;ref name="environment education"&gt;{{

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4252">'''Evans Starzinger''' and Beth Leonard are among the leading blue water [[Cruising (maritime)|cruising]] sailors today.
   
During the 1990s they completed a [[Circumnavigation]] aboard a [http://www.shannonyachts.com/ Shannon] 37' ketch, using the typical tropical route but including Cape Hope.  During the 2000s they have taken a custom built [http://www.stadtdesign.com/products/stock.htm/ Van De Stadt] designed 47' aluminum fractional sloop on a second circumnavigation, above the [[Arctic Circle]] and around all five [[great capes]] - [[Cape Horn]], [[Cape of Good Hope]], [[Cape Leeuwin]], [[South West Cape, Tasmania]] and [[South West Cape, New Zealand]]. This included a 9000-mile, 59-day, non-stop leg sailing East in the [[Southern Ocean]] from Puerto Williams to Fremantle.  In 2007 they completed a second 65,000 miles circumnavigation, east about, under all the great capes and above the Arctic Circle. In 2008 they cruised again around Patagonia, the Falkland Islands and South Georgia, and then up the Atlantic in 2009 to St Helena, the Caribbean and back to the Chesapeake bay to return to the same slip from which they started the voyage on Hawk. Since the completion of these two circumnavigations they have been back and forth to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia several times.

Beth &amp; Evans have won a number of noteworthy awards for their cruising.  These include:

*The 2003 Vasey Vase by the Ocean Cruising club for 9000 miles/59-day non-stop passage in the southern ocean and 2009 Vasey Vase for 2008 cruise to South Georgia
*The Far Horizons Medal by the Cruising club of America for their voyages.
*The Seven Seas Award, which signifies the highest international recognition to a cruising sailor whose experiences on the sea demonstrate a deep commitment to good seamanship and an understanding of his ship and environment. In the 57 years of SSCA’s existence, this honor has only been awarded sixteen times
*Beth's book "Blue Horizons" has won the Outdoor Literature category of the 2007 National Outdoor Book Awards.  It's the first time a sailing book has won the Literature prize. The announcement is on the NOBA website

Previous to their first voyage they both worked for [[McKinsey &amp; Company]], a leading corporate strategy consulting firm.  In between the two voyages, Evans Starzinger was a Vice President at [[General Electric]] running an IT business unit and Beth wrote three books (The Voyager's Handbook, Blue Horizon's and Following Seas). Most recently Evans has been CEO of two start-ups (North Thin Ply Technology &amp; Augmented reality Labs) and the Offshore Safety Regulations advisor on two US Sailing accident investigation panels. Beth is Editor of Seaworthy Magazine and Director of Technical Services at BoatUS.

[[File:Founder effect.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Founder effect: The original population (left) could give rise to different founder populations (right).]]

In [[population genetics]], the '''founder effect''' is the loss of genetic variation that occurs when a new population is established by a very small number of individuals from a larger population. It was first fully outlined by [[Ernst Mayr]] in 1942,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15280221 |pmc=1470966 |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15280221 |year=2004 |author1=Provine |first1=W. B. |authorlink=Will Provine |title=Ernst Mayr: Genetics and speciation |journal=Genetics |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=1041–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using existing theoretical work by those such as [[Sewall Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=6777243 |pmc=1214177 |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6777243 |year=1980 |author1=Templeton |first1=A. R. |title=The theory of speciation via the founder principle |journal=Genetics |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=1011–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the loss of genetic variation, the new population may be distinctively different, both [[genotype|genotypically]] and [[phenotype|phenotypically]], from the parent population from which it is derived. In extreme cases, the founder effect is thought to lead to the [[speciation]] and subsequent [[evolution]] of new species.

In the figure shown, the original population has nearly equal numbers of blue and red individuals. The three smaller founder populations show that one or the other color may predominate (founder effect), due to random sampling of the original population. A [[population bottleneck]] may also cause a founder effect, though it is not strictly a new population.

The founder effect occurs when a small group of migrants that is not genetically representative of the population from which they came establish in a new area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Leland |last1=Hartwell |first2=Leroy |last2=Hood |first3=Michael |last3=Goldberg |first4=Ann E. |last4=Reynolds |first5=Lee |last5=Silver |first6=Ruth C |last6=Veres |year=2004 |title=Genetics: From Genes to Genomes |page=241 |isbn=978-0-07-121468-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Peter H. |last1=Raven |first2=Ray F. |last2=Evert |first3=Susan E. |last3=Eichhorn |year=1999 |title=Biology of Plants |page=241 |publisher=W H Freeman and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to founder effects, the new population is often a very [[small population size|small population]], so shows increased sensitivity to [[genetic drift]], an increase in [[inbreeding]], and relatively low [[genetic variation]].

==Founder mutation==
In [[genetics]], a '''founder mutation''' is a [[mutation]] that appears in the [[DNA]] of one or more individuals which are founders of a distinct population. Founder mutations initiate with changes that occur in the DNA and can be passed down to other generations.&lt;ref name=BSCS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bscs.org/pages/curriculumdevelopment/onco/glossary.htm |title=Bioinformatics Glossary |publisher=bscs.org |accessdate=2009-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325145659/http://bscs.org/pages/curriculumdevelopment/onco/glossary.htm |archivedate=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CIHR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mshri.on.ca/colorectalcancer/definitions.html |title=Colorectal Cancer Research Definitions |publisher=www.mshri.on.ca |accessdate=2009-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724072927/http://www.mshri.on.ca/colorectalcancer/definitions.html |archivedate=July 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mutation may occur in any organism that becomes a founder of the line of descendants containing that mutation, which could be as simple as a virus,&lt;ref name="pmid26052661"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Joseph, S.

Founder mutations originate in long stretches of DNA on a single [[chromosome]]; indeed, the original [[haplotype]] is the whole chromosome. As the generations progress, the proportion of the haplotype that is common to all carriers of the mutation is shortened (due to [[genetic recombination]]). This shortening allows scientists to roughly estimate the age of the mutation.&lt;ref name=SCIAM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=founder-mutations |title=Founder Mutations: Scientific American
|publisher=www.sciam.com |accessdate=2009-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
The founder effect is a special case of [[genetic drift]], occurring when a small group in a population splinters off from the original population and forms a new one. The new colony may have less genetic variation than the original population, and through the random sampling of [[allele]]s during reproduction of subsequent generations, continue rapidly towards [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixation]]. This consequence of inbreeding makes the colony more vulnerable to extinction.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

When a newly formed colony is small, its founders can strongly affect the population's genetic makeup far into the future. In humans, who have a slow reproduction rate, the population will remain small for many generations, effectively amplifying the drift effect generation after generation until the population reaches a certain size. Alleles which were present but relatively rare in the original population can move to one of two extremes. The most common one is that the allele is soon lost altogether, but the other possibility is that the allele survives and within a few generations has become much more dispersed throughout the population. The new colony can experience an increase in the frequency of [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]] alleles, as well, and as a result, an increased number who are [[homozygous]] for certain recessive traits.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The variation in gene frequency between the original population and colony may also trigger the two groups to [[genetic divergence|diverge]] significantly over the course of many generations. As the variance, or [[genetic distance]], increases, the two separated populations may become distinctively different, both [[genotype|genetically]] and [[phenotype|phenotypically]], although not only genetic drift, but also natural selection, gene flow and mutation all contribute to this divergence. This potential for relatively rapid changes in the colony's gene frequency led most scientists to consider the founder effect (and by extension, genetic drift) a significant driving force in the evolution of [[speciation|new species]]. [[Sewall Wright]] was the first to attach this significance to random drift and small, newly isolated populations with his [[shifting balance theory]] of speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wade |first1=Michael S. |last2=Wolf |first2=Jason |last3=Brodie |first3=Edmund D. |title=Epistasis and the evolutionary process |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2000 |page=330 |isbn=0-19-512806-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following behind Wright, [[Ernst Mayr]] created many persuasive models to show that the decline in genetic variation and small population size accompanying the founder effect were critically important for new species to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Systematics and the Origin of Species: on Ernst Mayr's 100th anniversary |author1=Mayr, Ernst | author1link=Ernst Mayr |author2=Hey, Jody |author3=Fitch, Walter M. |author4=Ayala, Francisco José |publisher=National Academies Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-309-09536-5 |page=367 |edition=Illustrated }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, much less support for this view is shown today, since the hypothesis has been tested repeatedly through experimental research, and the results have been equivocal at best.{{elucidate|date=April 2013}} Speciation by genetic drift is a specific case of [[peripatric speciation]] which in itself occurs in rare instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/VC1cPeripatric.shtml | title=Peripatric Speciation | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040423015847/http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/VC1cPeripatric.shtml | publisher= evolution.berkeley.edu | archivedate=April 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes place when a random change in genetic frequency of population favours the survival of a few organisms of the species with rare genes which cause reproductive mutation. These surviving organisms then breed among themselves over a long period of time to create a whole new species whose reproductive systems or behaviors are no longer compatible with the original population. {{elucidate|date=November 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Endless Forms |last=Howard |first=Daniel J. |last2=Berlocher |first2=Steward H. |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn= 978-0-19-510901-6 |page=470 |edition=Illustrated |location=United States |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serial founder effect==
Serial founder effects have occurred when populations migrate over long distances. Such long-distance migrations typically involve relatively rapid movements followed by periods of settlement. The populations in each migration carry only a subset of the genetic diversity carried from previous migrations. As a result, genetic differentiation tends to increase with geographic distance as described by the "isolation by distance" model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0507611102 |jstor=4143304 |pmid=16243969 |pmc=1276087 |title=Support from the relationship of genetic and geographic distance in human populations for a serial founder effect originating in Africa |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=102 |issue=44 |pages=15942–7 |year=2005 |last1=Ramachandran |first1=S. |last2=Deshpande |first2=O. |last3=Roseman |first3=C.

L. |bibcode=2005PNAS..10215942R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The migration of humans [[Recent African origin of modern humans|out of Africa]] is characterized by serial founder effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0903341106 |jstor=40485019 |pmid=19706453 |pmc=2752555 |title=Explaining worldwide patterns of human genetic variation using a coalescent-based serial founder model of migration outward from Africa |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=106 |issue=38 |pages=16057–62 |year=2009 |last1=Degiorgio |first1=M. |last2=Jakobsson |first2=M. |last3=Rosenberg |first3=N. A. |bibcode=2009PNAS..10616057D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Africa has the highest degree of genetic diversity of any continent, which is consistent with an African origin of modern humans. After the initial migration from Africa, the Indian subcontinent was the first major settling point for modern humans. Consequently, India has the second-highest genetic diversity in the world. In general, the genetic diversity of the Indian subcontinent is a subset of Africa, and the genetic diversity outside Africa is a subset of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12041-009-0020-3 |pmid=19417557 |title=Phylogeographic distribution of mitochondrial DNA macrohaplogroup M in India |journal=Journal of Genetics |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=127–39 |year=2009 |last1=Maji |first1=Suvendu |last2=Krithika |first2=S. |last3=Vasulu |first3=T.

==In island ecology==
Founder populations are essential to the study of [[island biogeography]] and [[island ecology]]. A natural "blank slate" is not easily found, but a classic series of studies on founder population effects was done following the catastrophic 1883 eruption of [[Krakatoa]], which erased all life on the island. Another continuing study has been following the biocolonization of [[Surtsey]], [[Iceland]], a new volcanic island that erupted offshore between 1963 and 1967. An earlier event, the [[Toba catastrophe theory|Toba eruption]] in Sumatra about 73,000 years ago, covered some parts of India with {{convert|3|-|6|m|0|abbr=on}} of ash, and must have coated the [[Nicobar Islands]] and [[Andaman Islands]], much nearer in the ash fallout cone, with life-smothering layers, forcing the restart of their [[biodiversity]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

However, not all founder effect studies are initiated after a natural disaster; some scientists study the reinstatement of a species that became locally extinct. Hajji and others, and Hundertmark &amp; Van Daele, studied the current population statuses of past founder effects in [[Corsican red deer]] and Alaskan elk, respectively. Corsican red deer are still listed as an [[endangered species|endangered]] species, decades after a severe bottleneck. They inhabit the Tyrrhenian islands and surrounding mainlands currently, and before the bottleneck, but Hajji and others wanted to know how the deer originally got to the islands, and from what parent population or species they were derived. Through molecular analysis, they were able to determine a possible lineage, with red deer from the islands of [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] being the most related to one another. These results are promising, as the island of Corsica was repopulated with red deer from the Sardinian island after the original Corsican red deer population became extinct, and the deer now inhabiting the island of Corsica are diverging from those inhabiting Sardinia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10531-007-9297-9 |title=Phylogeography and founder effect of the endangered Corsican red deer (Cervus elaphus corsicanus) |journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=659–73 |year=2007 |last1=Hajji |first1=Ghaiet M. |last2=Charfi-Cheikrouha |first2=F. |last3=Lorenzini |first3=Rita |last4=Vigne |first4=Jean-Denis |last5=Hartl |first5=Günther B. |last6=Zachos |first6=Frank E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10592-009-0013-z |title=Founder effect and bottleneck signatures in an introduced, insular population of elk |journal=Conservation Genetics |volume=11 |pages=139–47 |year=2009 |last1=Hundertmark |first1=Kris J. |last2=Van Daele |first2=Larry J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kolbe and others set up a pair of genetically sequenced and morphologically examined [[lizard]]s on seven small islands to watch each new population's growth and adaptation to its new environment. Specifically, they were looking at the effects on limb length and perch width, both widely varying phenotypic ranges in the parent population. Unfortunately, immigration did occur, but the founder effect and adaptive differentiation, which could eventually lead to peripatric speciation, were statistically and biologically significant between the island populations after a few years. The authors also point out that although adaptive differentiation is significant, the differences between island populations best reflect the differences between founders and their genetic diversity that has been passed down through the generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1209566 |pmid=22300849 |title=Founder Effects Persist Despite Adaptive Differentiation: A Field Experiment with Lizards |journal=Science |volume=335 |issue=6072 |pages=1086–9 |year=2012 |last1=Kolbe |first1=J.

==In human populations==
Due to various migrations throughout human history, founder effects are somewhat common among humans in different times and places. The [[French Canadians]] of [[Quebec]] are a classical example of founder population. Over 150 years of French colonization, between 1608 and 1760, an estimated 8,500 pioneers married and left at least one descendant on the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Hubert |last1=Charbonneau |first2=Bertrand |last2=Desjardins |first3=Jacques |last3=Légaré |first4=Hubert |last4=Denis |chapter=The Population of the St. Lawrence Valley 1608–1760 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPdgiysIVcgC&amp;pg=PA99 |pages=99–142 |editor1-first=Michael R. |editor1-last=Haines |editor2-first=Richard H. |editor2-last=Stecke |year=2010 |title=A Population History of North America |isbn=978-0-521-49666-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the takeover of the colony by the British crown in 1760, immigration from France effectively stopped, but descendents of French settlers continued to grow in number mainly because of high fertility rate. Intermarriage occurred mostly with the deported Acadians and migrants coming from the British Isles. Since the 20th century, immigration in Quebec and mixing of French Canadians involve people from all over the world. While the French Canadians of Quebec today may be partly of other ancestries, the genetic contribution of the original French founders is predominant, explaining about 90% of regional gene pools, while Acadians (descended from other French settlers in eastern Canada) explain 4%, British 2% and Native American and other groups contributed less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ajpa.21424 |pmid=21302269 |title=Admixed ancestry and stratification of Quebec regional populations |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=144 |issue=3 |pages=432–41 |year=2011 |last1=Bherer |first1=Claude |last2=Labuda |first2=Damian |last3=Roy-Gagnon |first3=Marie-Hélène |last4=Houde |first4=Louis |last5=Tremblay |first5=Marc |last6=Vézina |first6=Hélène }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=November 2011}}

In humans, founder effects can arise from cultural isolation, and inevitably, [[endogamy]]. For example, the [[Amish]] populations in the United States exhibit founder effects because they have grown from a very few founders, have not recruited newcomers, and tend to marry within the community. Though still rare, phenomena such as [[polydactyly]] (extra fingers and toes, a symptom of a condition such as&lt;ref name="ghr-nlm-nih-WAD"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/weyers-acrofacial-dysostosis

Around 1814, a small group of British colonists founded a settlement on [[Tristan da Cunha]], a group of small islands in the Atlantic Ocean, midway between Africa and South America. One of the early colonists apparently carried a rare, recessive allele for [[retinitis pigmentosa]], a progressive form of blindness that afflicts homozygous individuals. As late as 1961, the majority of the genes in the gene pool on Tristan were still derived from 15 original ancestors; as a consequence of the inbreeding, of 232 people tested in 1961, four were suffering from retinitis pigmentosa. This represents a prevalence of 1 in 58, compared with a worldwide prevalence of around 1 in 4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2906351/pdf/eugenrev00006-0016.pdf | pmc=2906351 | pmid=4864588 | volume=59 | title=Genetical changes in mice and men | year=1967 | journal=Eugen Rev | pages=78–96 | last1=Berry | first1=RJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buying fuelwood.jpeg|thumb|[[Wood]] is one of the first fuels used by [[human]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sgphv2ydAHwC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=wood+one+of+the+first+fuels+used+by+humans&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7lvX8n-LUAhVC4WMKHU2WB4IQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=wood%20one%20of%20the%20first%20fuels%20used%20by%20humans&amp;f=false|title=Chemistry of Fossil Fuels and Biofuels|last=Schobert|first=Harold|date=2013-01-17|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9780521114004|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''fuel''' is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases  energy as heat energy or to be used for [[work (physics)|work]]. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via [[nuclear fission]] and  [[nuclear fusion]]).

The heat energy released by reactions of fuels is converted into [[mechanical energy]] via a [[heat engine]]. Other times the heat itself is valued for warmth, [[cooking]], or industrial processes, as well as the illumination that comes with [[combustion]]. Fuels are also used in the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of [[organism]]s in a process known as [[cellular respiration]], where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy. [[Hydrocarbon]]s and related oxygen-containing molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans, but other substances, including radioactive metals, are also utilized.

Fuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy, such as those that directly release [[electrical energy]] (such as [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and [[capacitor]]s) or mechanical energy (such as [[flywheel]]s, springs, compressed air, or water in a reservoir).

==History==
The first known use of fuel was the combustion of wood or sticks by ''[[Homo erectus]]'' nearly two million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Origin of Humankind | author = [[Richard Leakey|Leakey, Richard]] | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=75-cwH1905QC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=%22first+use+of+Fire%22 | year = 1994 | publisher = [[Basic Books]] | isbn = 0-465-03135-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Throughout most of human history fuels derived from plants or animal fat were only used by humans. [[Charcoal]], a wood derivative, has been used since at least 6,000 BCE for melting metals. It was only supplanted by [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], derived from coal, as European forests started to become depleted around the 18th century. Charcoal briquettes are now commonly used as a fuel for [[barbecue]] cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Coal was first used as a fuel around 1000 BCE in China. With the energy in the form of [[chemical energy]] that could be released through [[combustion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|title=Fuel|volume=11|pages=274-286|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabrit11chisrich#page/274/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the concept 
development of the [[steam engine]] in the United Kingdom in 1769, coal came into more common use as a power source. Coal was later used to drive ships and [[locomotive]]s. By the 19th century, gas extracted from coal was being used for street lighting in [[London]]. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the primary use of coal is to generate [[electricity]], providing 40% of the world's electrical power supply in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Fossil fuels were rapidly adopted during the Industrial Revolution, because they were more concentrated and flexible than traditional energy sources, such as water power. They have become a pivotal part of our contemporary society, with most countries in the world burning fossil fuels in order to produce power.

Currently the trend has been towards renewable fuels, such as [[Renewable energy#Biofuel|biofuels]] like alcohols.

==Chemical==
Chemical fuels are substances that release energy by reacting with substances around them, most notably by the process of [[combustion]]. Most of the chemical energy released in combustion was not stored in the chemical bonds of the fuel, but in the weak double bond of molecular oxygen.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr 15"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt-Rohr | first1 = K | year = 2015 | title = Why Combustions Are Always Exothermic, Yielding About 418 kJ per Mole of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; | doi = 10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00333 | journal = J. Chem. Educ. | volume = 92 | issue = 12| pages = 2094–2099 | bibcode = 2015JChEd..92.2094S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical fuels are divided in two ways. First, by their physical properties, as a solid, liquid or gas. Secondly, on the basis of their occurrence: ''primary (natural fuel)'' and ''secondary (artificial fuel)''. Thus, a general classification of chemical fuels is:

===Solid fuel===
{{main|Solid fuel}}

[[File:Coal anthracite.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Coal is an important solid fuel]]

Solid fuel refers to various types of [[solid]] material that are used as fuel to produce [[energy]] and provide [[heating]], usually released through [[combustion]]. Solid fuels include [[wood]] , [[charcoal]], [[peat]], [[coal]], [[hexamine fuel tablet]]s, and pellets made from wood (see [[wood pellets]]), [[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[rye]] and other [[cereal|grains]]. [[Solid-fuel rocket]] technology also uses solid fuel (see [[Rocket fuel#Solid propellants|solid propellants]]). Solid fuels have been used by humanity for many years to [[making fire|create fire]]. Coal was the fuel source which enabled the [[industrial revolution]], from firing [[furnace]]s, to running [[steam engine]]s. Wood was also extensively used to run [[steam locomotive]]s. Both peat and coal are still used in [[electricity generation]] today.
The use of some solid fuels (e.g. coal) is restricted or prohibited in some urban areas, due to unsafe levels of toxic emissions. The use of other solid fuels as wood is decreasing as heating technology and the availability of good quality fuel improves. In some areas, [[anthracite|smokeless coal]] is often the only solid fuel used. In Ireland, peat [[briquette]]s are used as smokeless fuel. They are also used to start a coal fire.

===Liquid fuels===
{{main|Liquid fuel}}

[[File:Benzinepomp002.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A [[gasoline station]]]]

Liquid fuels are combustible or energy-generating molecules that can be harnessed to create [[mechanical energy]], usually producing [[kinetic energy]]; they also must take the shape of their container. It is the fumes of liquid fuels that are flammable instead of the fluid.

Most liquid fuels in widespread use are derived from the [[fossil fuels|fossilized remains]] of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure inside the Earth's crust. However, there are several types, such as hydrogen fuel (for [[automotive]] uses), ethanol, jet fuel and bio-diesel which are all categorized as a liquid fuel. [[Emulsified fuel]]s of oil-in-water such as [[orimulsion]] have been developed a way to make heavy oil fractions usable as liquid fuels. Many liquid fuels play a primary role in transportation and the economy.

Some common properties of liquid fuels are that they are easy to transport, and that can be handled easily. Also they are relatively easy to use for all engineering applications, and home use. Fuels like kerosene are rationed in some countries, for example available in government subsidized shops in India for home use.

Conventional diesel is similar to gasoline in that it is a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons extracted from petroleum. Kerosene is used in [[kerosene lamp]]s and as a fuel for cooking, heating, and small engines. [[Natural gas]], composed chiefly of [[methane]], can only exist as a liquid at very low temperatures (regardless of pressure), which limits its direct use as a liquid fuel in most applications. [[LP gas]] is a mixture of [[propane]] and [[butane]], both of which are easily compressible gases under standard atmospheric conditions. It offers many of the advantages of [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG), but is denser than air, does not burn as cleanly, and is much more easily compressed. Commonly used for cooking and space heating, LP gas and compressed propane are seeing increased use in motorized vehicles; propane is the third most commonly used motor fuel globally.

===Fuel gas===
{{main|Fuel gas}}

[[File:Propane tank 20lb.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A 20-pound ({{nowrap|9.1 kg}}) propane cylinder]]

Fuel gas is any one of a number of fuels that are [[gas]]eous under ordinary conditions. Many fuel gases are composed of [[hydrocarbons]] (such as [[methane]] or [[propane]]), [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], or mixtures thereof. Such gases are sources of potential [[heat energy]] or [[light energy]] that can be readily transmitted and distributed through pipes from the point of origin directly to the place of consumption. Fuel gas is contrasted with [[liquid fuels]] and from [[solid fuel]]s, though some fuel gases are [[Liquefaction of gases|liquefied]] for storage or transport. While their gaseous nature can be advantageous, avoiding the difficulty of transporting solid fuel and the dangers of spillage inherent in liquid fuels, it can also be dangerous. It is possible for a fuel gas to be undetected and collect in certain areas, leading to the risk of a [[gas explosion]]. For this reason, [[odorizer]]s are added to most fuel gases so that they may be detected by a distinct smell. The most common type of fuel gas in current use is [[natural gas]].

===Biofuels===
{{main|Biofuel}}

[[Biofuel]] can be broadly defined  as solid, liquid, or gas fuel consisting of, or derived from [[biomass]]. Biomass can also be used directly for heating or power—known as ''biomass fuel''. Biofuel can be produced from any carbon source that can be replenished rapidly e.g. plants. Many different plants and plant-derived materials are used for biofuel manufacture.

Perhaps the earliest fuel  employed by humans is wood. Evidence shows controlled fire was used up to 1.5 million years ago at [[Swartkrans]], South Africa. It is unknown which hominid species first used fire, as both ''[[Australopithecus]]'' and an early species of ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' were present at the sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Recently biofuels have been developed for use in automotive transport (for example [[Bioethanol]] and [[Biodiesel]]), but there is widespread public debate about how carbon efficient these fuels are.

===Fossil fuels===
{{main|Fossil fuel}}

[[File:Extraction of oil.jpg|thumb|Extraction of petroleum]]

Fossil fuels are [[hydrocarbon]]s, primarily [[coal]] and [[petroleum]] ([[liquid petroleum]] or [[natural gas]]), formed from the [[fossil|fossilized remains]] of ancient plants and animals&lt;ref name="elements1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Irene Novaczek|title=Canada's Fossil Fuel Dependency|url=http://www.elements.nb.ca/theme/fuels/irene/novaczek.htm|publisher=Elements|accessdate =2007-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; by exposure to high heat and pressure in the absence of oxygen in the [[Earth]]'s [[Crust (geology)|crust]] over hundreds of millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fossil fuel |url=http://oaspub.epa.gov/trs/trs_proc_qry.navigate_term?p_term_id=7068&amp;p_term_cd=TERM |publisher=[[EPA]] |accessdate=2007-01-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312054557/http://oaspub.epa.gov/trs/trs_proc_qry.navigate_term?p_term_id=7068&amp;p_term_cd=TERM |archivedate=12 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, the term fossil fuel also includes hydrocarbon-containing [[natural resource]]s that are not derived entirely from biological sources, such as [[tar sands]].  These latter sources are properly known as ''mineral fuels''.

Fossil fuels contain high percentages of [[carbon]] and include [[coal]], [[petroleum]], and [[natural gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fossil fuel|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/f/fossil_fuel.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510063436/https://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/f/fossil_fuel.htm|archivedate=10 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They range from [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]]  materials with low [[carbon]]:[[hydrogen]] ratios like [[methane]], to liquid petroleum to nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon, like [[anthracite]] coal. Methane can be found in [[hydrocarbon]] fields, alone, associated with oil, or in the form of [[methane clathrates]]. Fossil fuels formed from the [[fossil|fossilized remains]] of dead plants&lt;ref name="elements1"/&gt; by exposure to heat and pressure in the Earth's crust over millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fossil fuel|url=http://oaspub.epa.gov/trs/trs_proc_qry.navigate_term?p_term_id=7068&amp;p_term_cd=TERM|publisher=EPA|accessdate=2007-01-18|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070312054557/http://oaspub.epa.gov/trs/trs_proc_qry.navigate_term%3Fp_term_id%3D7068%26p_term_cd%3DTERM |archivedate = 12 March 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Petroleum#Biogenic theory|biogenic theory]] was first introduced by German scholar [[Georg Agricola]] in 1556 and later by [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] in the 18th century.

It  was estimated by the [[Energy Information Administration]] that in 2007 primary sources of energy consisted of petroleum 36.0%, coal 27.4%, natural gas 23.0%, amounting to an 86.4% share for fossil fuels in primary energy consumption in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm|title=U.S. EIA International Energy Statistics|accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-fossil sources in 2006 included [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] 6.3%, [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] 8.5%, and others ([[Geothermal power|geothermal]], [[Solar energy|solar]], [[Tidal power|tidal]], [[Wind power|wind]], [[Wood fuel|wood]], [[Waste-to-energy|waste]]) amounting to 0.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/iea/overview.html|title=International Energy Annual 2006|accessdate=2009-02-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205035658/http://www.eia.doe.gov/iea/overview.html|archivedate=5 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; World energy consumption was growing about 2.3% per year.

Fossil fuels are [[non-renewable resources]] because they take millions of years to form, and reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being made. So we must conserve these fuels and use them judiciously. The production and use of fossil fuels raise environmental concerns. A global movement toward the generation of [[renewable energy]] is therefore under way to help meet increased energy needs. The burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion [[tonnes]] (21.3 [[gigatonne]]s) of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) per year, but it is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year (one tonne of atmospheric carbon is equivalent to 44/12 or 3.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggccebro/chapter1.html|title=US Department of Energy on greenhouse gases|accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carbon dioxide is one of the [[greenhouse gas]]es that enhances [[radiative forcing]] and contributes to [[global warming]], causing the [[Instrumental temperature record|average surface temperature]] of the Earth to rise in response, which [[Scientific opinion on climate change|the vast majority of climate scientists]] agree will cause major [[Effects of global warming|adverse effects]].
Fuels are a source of energy.

===Energy===
The amount of energy from different types of fuel depends on the [[stoichiometric ratio]], the chemically correct air and fuel ratio to ensure complete combustion of fuel, and its [[specific energy]], the energy per unit mass.

==Nuclear==
{{main|Nuclear fuel}}

[[File:CANDU fuel bundles.jpg|right|thumb|350px|'''CANDU fuel bundles''' Two [[CANDU]] ("CANada Deuterium Uranium") fuel bundles, each about 50{{nbsp}}cm long and 10{{nbsp}}cm in diameter]]

Nuclear fuel is any material that is consumed to derive [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. Technically speaking, all matter can be a nuclear fuel because any element under the right conditions will release nuclear energy,{{dubious|date=October 2016}} but the materials commonly referred to as nuclear fuels are those that will produce energy without being placed under extreme duress. Nuclear fuel is a material that can be 'burned' by [[nuclear fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] to derive [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. ''Nuclear fuel'' can refer to the fuel itself, or to physical objects (for example bundles composed of '''fuel rods''') composed of the fuel material, mixed with structural, [[neutron moderator|neutron moderating]], or neutron reflecting materials.

Most nuclear fuels contain heavy [[fissile]] elements that are capable of nuclear fission.  When these fuels are struck by neutrons, they are in turn capable of emitting neutrons when they break apart.  This makes possible a self-sustaining [[chain reaction]] that releases energy with a controlled rate in a [[nuclear reactor]] or with a very rapid uncontrolled rate in a [[nuclear weapon]].

The most common fissile nuclear fuels are [[uranium-235]] (&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U) and [[Pu-239|plutonium-239]] (&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu). The actions of mining, refining, purifying, using, and ultimately disposing of nuclear fuel together make up the [[nuclear fuel cycle]]. Not all types of nuclear fuels create power from nuclear fission.  [[Plutonium-238]] and some other elements are used to produce small amounts of nuclear power by [[radioactive decay]] in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s and other types of [[atomic battery|atomic batteries]]. Also, light [[nuclide]]s such as [[tritium]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H) can be used as fuel for [[nuclear fusion]].
Nuclear fuel has the highest [[energy density]] of all practical fuel sources.

===Fission===

[[File:Nuclear fuel pellets.jpeg|thumb|[[Nuclear fuel]] pellets are used to release nuclear energy]]

The most common type of nuclear fuel used by humans is heavy [[fissile]] elements that can be made to undergo [[nuclear fission]] [[chain reaction]]s in a  [[nuclear reactor|nuclear fission reactor]]; ''nuclear fuel'' can refer to the material or to physical objects (for example fuel bundles composed of [[fuel rod]]s) composed of the fuel material, perhaps mixed with structural, [[neutron moderator|neutron moderating]], or neutron reflecting materials.  The most common fissile nuclear fuels are [[Uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]] and [[Pu-239|&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu]], and the actions of mining, refining, purifying, using, and ultimately disposing of these elements together make up the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], which is important for its relevance to [[nuclear power]] generation and [[nuclear weapon]]s.

===Fusion===
Fuels that produce energy by the process of [[nuclear fusion]] are currently not utilized by humans but are the main source of fuel for [[star]]s. Fusion fuels tend to be light elements such as [[hydrogen]] which will combine easily. Energy is required to start fusion by raising temperature so high all materials would turn into plasma, and allow nuclei to collide and stick together with each other before repelling due to electric charge. This process is called fusion and it can give out energy.

In stars that undergo nuclear fusion, fuel consists of [[atomic nuclei]] that can release energy by the absorption of a [[proton]] or [[neutron]]. In most stars the fuel is provided by hydrogen, which can combine to form [[helium]] through the [[proton-proton chain reaction]] or by the [[CNO cycle]]. When the hydrogen fuel is exhausted, nuclear fusion can continue with progressively heavier elements, although the net energy released is lower because of the smaller difference in nuclear binding energy. Once [[iron-56]] or [[isotopes of nickel|nickel-56]] nuclei are produced, no further energy can be obtained by nuclear fusion as these have the highest nuclear binding energies. The elements then on use up energy instead of giving off energy when fused. Therefore, fusion stops and the star dies. In attempts by humans, fusion is only carried out with hydrogen (isotope of 2 and 3) to form helium-4 as this reaction gives out the most net energy. Electric confinement ([[ITER]]), [[inertial confinement]](heating by laser) and heating by strong electric currents are the popular methods used. .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==World trade==
The [[World Bank]] reported that the USA was the top fuel importer in 2005 followed by the EU and Japan.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}&lt;!-- Is this specifically about petroleum imports? --&gt;

==Liquid fuels for transportation==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}
Most transportation fuels are liquids, because vehicles usually require high [[energy density]]. This occurs naturally in liquids and solids. High energy density can also be provided by an [[internal combustion engine]]. These engines require clean-burning fuels. The fuels that are easiest to burn cleanly are typically liquids and gases. Thus, liquids meet the requirements of being both energy-dense and clean-burning. In addition, liquids (and gases) can be pumped, which means handling is easily mechanized, and thus less laborious.

[[File:WW2-Holocaust-Poland.PNG|thumb|A map of Poland during its German Occupation.]]
The '''Gorlice Ghetto''' was established in the year 1940 after [[German occupation of Poland|German occupation of the Polish]] city began on September 7, 1939. As one of many ghettos created by [[Nazi Germany]] in the [[General Government]], its establishment meant further persecution and violence against the nearly 3,400 Jewish citizens that were settled in the area.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933–1945|The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos 1933-1945]]|last=Megargee|first=Geoffrey P.|authorlink=Geoffrey P. Megargee|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|year=2009|isbn=9780253002266|location=Bloomington, Indiana|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As German forces quickly seized hundreds of the young, able men of [[Gorlice]] in order to use them for forced labor, many Jews began hiding for their lives as their businesses were taken and the rapid spread of disease plagued the city. The ghetto was officially dissolved on September 14, 1942, and carried with its downfall the transportation of hundreds of Jews to the concentration camp located in [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==

&lt;!---[[File:FinatHeydrichDaluegeWolffBerlin1940.jpg|left|thumb|Heydrich and members of the German-SS.]]---&gt;
In Gorlice, the German occupation of September 7, 1939 marked the beginnings of establishing a ghetto in the city, as the [[Wehrmacht]] began taking Jews from their homes, robbing them of earthly possessions, and forcing them into labor-intensive work. Jewish businesses were taken over and implemented into fabricated "trustee" groups by the Germans. Though some owners were granted access to keep their businesses running, many women ended up taking over the establishments, as the Jewish men went into hiding, attempting to escape from a life of forced labor by the Reich.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Population and consumption ==

During the first year of occupation, the Jewish population of Gorlice actually increased, despite the increase of violence in the area and the initial move many residents took beginning at the outbreak of the war in Europe. Hundreds of refugees from Germany poured into the city following increases of violence instances within the country, most famously that of Kristallnacht. With this increase in community size, food shortages became a problem for families in the area. Soup kitchens, like those opened by [[Judenrat]] in 1940, were rare sources of nourishment for the thousands of refugees.

Smuggling food became a necessary part of survival for many Jews occupying Gorlice, many obtaining sustenance from the neighboring country of [[Slovakia]], nearly nineteen miles away from the location of the ghetto. The ghetto itself was guarded by Ukrainian police officials and, though they were firm in serving the local [[Gestapo]], some officers aided the Jews inside by helping them to smuggling food supplies like coffee, tea, and cocoa into Gorlice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This kind of desperation was indicative of the overarching Nazi motive behind ghettoization of so many parts of Europe, that being to drain all physical elements of worth from the Jewish people in hopes to drive them out of what was to become a greater German population. The hard conditions and starvation within the occupied areas was meant to force the Jews to sell all their earthly possessions in order to afford food and drink to survive. Soon, many families found themselves drained of all resources and food became a "luxury" of the "wealthy."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/427331887|title=The Oxford handbook of Holocaust studies|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Hayes, Peter, 1946 September 7-, Roth, John K.|isbn=9780199211869|location=Oxford [England]|oclc=427331887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conditions ==

The ghettos in [[German-occupied Poland|German occupied Poland]] in the early 1940s became overrun with sickness and fatal diseases. Due to lack of proper nutrition or resources, it became a common occurrence to have entire families ill to the point of no return with little means to cure their ailments. Until 1941, no Jewish doctors were given access to help patients leaving many dead from lack of proper healthcare. Late 1940 saw a small hospital open for affected Jews through funding from the [[Judenrat]] and Jewish doctors and physicians from the [[Kraków|Kraków]] district from the JSS (Jewish Self Help) organization. Though this was all set up with good intention, little funding translated into gaining access to vital medicines, leaving many with a lack of aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/warsaw_ghetto/organization.asp|title=The Albums of the Self-Help Oragnization|last=The Holocaust Remembrance Center|first=|date=|website=Photographs from the Warsaw Ghetto|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the Dr. Otstanki "put aside his antisemitic convictions" and attempted to attend to the sick of Gorlice, at great risk of being persecuted by Nazi SS forces. Other doctors, like Dr. Feldmaus arrived in 1941, and by fall there were two dental service posts opened within the ghetto.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Persecution in the ghetto ==

German SS forces controlled nearly every aspect of life for the Jews within the Gorlice Ghetto, and instances of intense violence or discrimination were common within the area. Beatings of Jewish men, women, and children on public streets became part of living in the ghetto, and vicious kidnapping of Jewish men in hiding happened more often than not, leading to more Jews being forced into going to labor camps. As the Judenrat became a bigger source of aid to the Jews in Gorlice, they began to feed into Nazi opposition. Rumors in 1942 flew about that the ghetto would soon be liquidated, and in an effort to enforce their control over the Jewish citizens of the occupied territory, Nazi forces ordered all the men of the ghetto to the town square. They demanded for 250,000 [[Polish złoty|złoty]], an amount unpayable by the starving and poor living in Gorlice. Many hid from the SS forces in an effort to escape this persecution, and all who were found hiding were shot on site. Some Jews from the square were selected to go to the Płaszow concentration camp, were forced to undress, and were shot against open mass graves. Members of the [[Jewish Ghetto Police|Jewish Police]] and the Judenrat were lined against buildings with their families and, one by one, were murdered. Some laborers whose work proved "essential" to the German forces were kept alive, transported to paper factories, and were continuously forced to work. All other Jews who were no longer needed were taken to a shoe factory miles away, being starved of for the three day journey.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Growing Up in the Universe''''' was a series of lectures given by [[Richard Dawkins]] as part of the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]], in which he discussed the [[evolution|evolution of life]] in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins]], ''[[Brief Candle in the Dark: My Life in Science]]'', [[Bantam Press]], 2015, chapter "Christmas Lectures", pages 105-117 ({{ISBN|978-0-59307-256-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The lectures were first broadcast in 1991, in the form of five one-hour episodes, on the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom. The [[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]] was granted the rights to the televised lectures, and a DVD version was released by the foundation on 20 April 2007.

Dawkins' book ''[[Climbing Mount Improbable]]'' developed from the ideas presented in the lectures, and the title itself is taken from the third lecture in the series.

==Parts==

===Part 1: Waking Up in the Universe===
To start off part one, Dawkins discusses the amazing capabilities of the [[human body]] and contrasts these with the limited capabilities of computers and other man-made machines. He uses a small [[totem pole]] (which is used in [[ancestor worship]]) to illustrate the importance of studying our ancestors to understand how we've evolved. To contrast ease of reproduction with the difficulty of becoming an ancestor, Dawkins uses the example of paper folding to explain [[exponential growth]]. Dawkins then tells the audience that exponential growth does not generally happen in the real world - natural factors come into play which control the population numbers, meaning that only an elite group of organisms will actually become distant ancestors. To be in this elite group, the organism must "have what it takes" to survive and pass on their genes to offspring.

The long chain of successful ancestors means that the probability of our existence is very small, and we are lucky to be alive. By turning down the lights and shining a small spotlight on a large ruler in front of him, Dawkins illustrates the darkness of the distant past and of the unknown future.

After expounding on how lucky we are to be alive, and urging us not to waste the precious time that we have, Dawkins brings up the usefulness of science in aiding our understanding of the universe. He mentions the reply that [[Michael Faraday]] gave to [[Sir Robert Peel]] when asked about the use of science. Faraday's response was "What is the use of a baby?" Dawkins explains that Faraday was either referring to the vast potential of a baby, or to the idea that there must be something more to life than growing up, working, getting old, and dying. There must be a point to it all; Perhaps science can uncover the answers to our biggest questions.

To shake off the "anesthetic of familiarity," Dawkins shows the audience a number of strange terrestrial organisms which he humorously nicknames "By-Jovians," playing off a term we might use to refer to living organisms from another planet, for instance Jupiter. He uses a [[scanning electron microscope]] to look at small organisms including mites, mosquitoes, and a bee being parasitized by a [[strepsiptera]]. Using a model of a [[eukaryotic]] cell, he discusses the [[mitochondria]] and presents the audience with a complicated diagram of the [[metabolic pathways]].

Dawkins suggests that we can also shake off the familiarity by stepping backwards in time. By using a single pace to represent going back 1000 years, he starts at year zero and takes four steps in front of his desk, going back to 4000 BCE. Pointing to a portrait of [[Homo habilis]], he states that to go back to the time of habilis, he would have to walk about two kilometers. He has audience members hold up portraits of other human ancestors, telling them how far he would have to walk to get back to the time of each one.

By imagining what an advanced alien species would think of humans if they were to arrive on Earth, Dawkins suggests that their science would be similar to ours. They would know about [[pi]], the [[Pythagorean theorem]], and the [[theory of relativity]]. However, Dawkins explains that the alien anthropologists would most likely scoff at our local, parochial religious beliefs. He then contrasts evidence-based beliefs with revealed, tradition-based, and authority-based beliefs.

To explain the problem with beliefs in the supernatural, Dawkins conducts a small experiment with the audience to "find the psychic." Using a coin, he assigns half the audience to will it to land on heads, and assigns the other half to will it to land on tails. After each flip, the section of the audience that was wrong is eliminated from the experiment, and he repeats the experiment using the remainder. After eight coin flips, only one boy in the audience remains. Dawkins then asks the question "Is he psychic?" Obviously, because of how the experiment was set up, one person was bound to have been correct about the result of each coin flip. Dawkins argues that this is exactly how seemingly supernatural events occur in the real world, especially when the "audience" is the entire population of the planet.

To conclude the lecture, Dawkins claims that there is nothing wrong with having faith in a proper scientific prediction. To illustrate this, he takes a cannonball which has been suspended from the ceiling with a rope, pulls it aside and touches it to his forehead. He announces that he is going to release the cannonball, letting it swing away from him, and that when it comes back to him, he is going to ignore his natural instinct to run because he has faith in his scientific prediction of what will happen - the cannonball should stop about an inch short of his forehead. He releases the cannonball, and his prediction is proved correct.

===Part 2: Designed and Designoid Objects===
Dawkins' second lecture of the series examines the problem of design. He presents the audience with a number of simple objects, such as [[rocks]] and [[crystals]], and notes that these objects have been formed by simple laws of physics and are therefore not designed. He then examines some designed objects - including a [[microscope]], an electronic [[calculator]], a [[pocket watch]],
and a clay pot - and notes that none of these objects could have possibly come about by sheer luck. Dawkins then discusses what he calls "designoid objects", which are complex objects that are neither simple, nor designed. Not only are they complex on the outside, they are also complex on the inside - perhaps billions of times more complex than a designed object such as a microscope.

Dawkins then shows the audience a number of designed and designoid objects, including the [[pitcher plant]], megalithic mounds built by the compass termite, and pots made by [[trapdoor spider]]s, [[potter wasp]]s, and [[mason bee]]s. He examines some designoid objects that use [[camouflage]], such as a [[grasshopper]] that looks like a stone, a [[sea horse]] that looks like sea weed, a [[leaf insect]], a green snake, a [[stick insect]], and a collection of [[butterflies]] that look like dead leaves when their wings are closed. Dawkins notes that many animals share similar types of camouflage or protection because of a process called [[convergent evolution]]. Examples of such designoid objects include the [[hedgehog]] and the [[spiny anteater]] (both of which evolved pointed spines along their back) and the [[marsupial wolf]] (which looks like a dog but is actually a marsupial). He illustrates the reason why convergent evolution occurs by using two small models of commercial aircraft. The reason they look similar isn't due to industrial espionage, it is due to the fact that they are both built to fly, so they must make use of similar design principles.

Using a camera and a model eye, Dawkins then compares the designed camera with the designoid eye. Both are involved in similar processes - using a lens to direct light onto a film or a retina. Both the camera and the eye also have an iris, which is used to control the amount of light which is allowed in. Using a volunteer from the audience, Dawkins demonstrates the contraction of the human
iris by shining a light into her right eye.

The lecture then moves into an explanation of [[natural selection]], which brings forth designoid objects. To explain natural selection, Dawkins first explains [[artificial selection]] by discussing the evolution of [[wild cabbage]] into [[broccoli]], [[cauliflower]], [[cabbage]], [[red cabbage]], [[kohlrabi]], and [[Brussels sprouts]]. He continues the discussion of artificial selection by explaining the evolution of the ancestral wolf into the many varieties of modern dog. Starting with the ancestral wolf, Dawkins imagines that everyone on one side of the room is breeding for small wolves, while everyone on the other side is breeding for big wolves. By selectively breeding the smallest or largest of each litter for a number of years, you may eventually end up with something like the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] on one side of the room, and something like a [[Great Dane]] on the other side of the room.

Dawkins then introduces an Arthromorphs computer program (similar to the Biomorphs program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phy.syr.edu/courses/mirror/biomorph/ Blind Watchmaker Applet]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wDmfapFG?url=http://www.phy.syr.edu/courses/mirror/biomorph/ |date=3 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), explaining how it works while a volunteer uses the computer to selectively breed more and more generations.

At this point, Dawkins switches from explaining artificial selection to explaining natural selection. To demonstrate natural selection in a computer program, Dawkins uses a program written by Peter Fuchs to simulate the evolution of the [[spiderweb]]. The program builds "genetic" variations of a parent web, as if the web was actually being built by a child spider. For each generation, a simulation is run which randomly generates flies - some of which will hit the web, and others that will miss it. The child web that is able to capture the highest number of flies is selected as the parent for the next generation of webs. Dawkins shows the audience the "fossil record" that the program recorded after simulating a large number of generations overnight. The web starts off very simple and inefficient, but by the end it has evolved into a web that is highly efficient and highly complex. This is the same process that has led to the existence of all designoid objects.

Dawkins now discusses the most popular alternative to natural selection, which is known as [[creationism]]. He explains that creationists mistakenly believe designoid objects to be designed objects created by a divine being. Quoting from [[William Paley]]'s ''Natural Theology'', Dawkins discusses the [[argument from design]] using the example of the watch and the watchmaker. Even though designoid objects appear to be designed, [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] proved that this is not the case. Although Darwin's theory was discovered well after Paley developed his watchmaker argument, Dawkins explains that the argument of a divine watchmaker was still a bad argument, even in Paley's day. Paraphrasing [[David Hume]], Dawkins explains that anything capable of creating humans must itself be highly complicated. Thus, the argument from design actually explains nothing - "shooting itself in the foot." While it is true that designoid objects cannot come about by chance, evolution provides a non-random method of creation - namely, natural selection.

After developing the argument against a divine creator, Dawkins examines a number of designoid objects that contain imperfections, which is something you would not expect to find in an object that is supposedly created by a divine being. Showing the audience a [[halibut]] flatfish, he explains how they evolved from an upright swimming ancestor with one eye on each side of the head into a bottom-hugging flatfish with a distorted set of eyes on one side of the body. Dawkins claims that this is poorly designed, as any proper engineer would design an organism more like a [[Skate (fish)|skate]], which flattened out on its belly instead of on its side. This is an example of something you would expect from an evolved/designoid object, but not something you would expect from a created/designed object.

Using labeled building blocks, Dawkins shows the audience how designed objects came to be. He starts off by placing the simple block on the bottom, and explaining that you don't have to start with a complex being, but can start with a very simple foundation. If you have a simple foundation, you can place the next block on top - the designoid block. From this block, you can get complex organisms. Only after complex designoid objects come to be can you get the final building block of design (microscopes, clay pots, etc.).

===Part 3: Climbing Mount Improbable===

Dawkins starts the lecture coming in with a [[Stick Insect|stick insect]] on his hand. He describes with how many details such a being imitates its environment, its almost like a [[key (lock)|key]] that fits a [[Lock (security device)|lock]]. He then shows another insect, namely a [[Leaf Insect]], which basically looks exactly like a dead leaf. He gives some more examples for this amazing imitation of the surrounding, e.g. a [[Potoo]], which looks like a branch of tree and a [[thorn bug]], which gains protection by looking like a [[rose]] [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorn]].

He, once again, makes the point that you can compare these beings with a key, which they represent themselves, whereas nature is the lock. Professor Richard Dawkins then explains that a key has to fit a lock exactly, and demonstrates this with a model of a lock. He mentions that a key is something very improbable. However it is hard to measure the probability of such a key, therefore Dawkins takes a [[bicycle lock]] for illustration, where you can calculate how likely it is to open the lock, because there is a fixed number of dials with a fixed number of positions. In Dawkin's case we have 3 dials, with 6 positions each, so the probability that you open the lock by sheer luck is one in 216.

Dawkins then shows the mechanism of the lock with a big model: Each dial has to be in the correct position in order to open up the lock. The model is then adapted to demonstrate a staged or gradualist solution to finding the right combination to open the lock. The probability of unlocking the combination in three separate phases falls to one in eighteen.

In this illustration, Dawkins identifies the role of sub-stages in Darwinian evolution. It is to increase the efficiency of mutation without affecting the probability of evolutionary success. The single stage requires 216, while the series of sub-stages requires only 18 non-random mutations at 100% probability of evolutionary success. That is an efficiency factor of 12 for mutations due to sub-staging without any change in probability. Similar efficiencies are achieved with random mutation without any change in probability.

After addressing the claim by [[Fred Hoyle]] that probability alone could not produce the complexity of a typed text by Shakespeare, Dawkins introduces the notion of inherited improvements over a number of generations. Nature proceeds through small evolutionary steps,rather than large leaps. This idea is  illustrated by a model of the ascent of Mount Improbable, which provides the title for this lecture.

Dawkins then illustrates the difference between the reproduction of inanimate phenomena, such as fires spread through sparks, with the inter-generational transmission of DNA in living structures. The gradual evolutionary adaption of these organisms is demonstrated through the examples of the eye, varieties of wings and protective camouflage.

The example of the gradual emergence of the eye is first shown: starting with a simple light sensitive flat surface and demonstrating the evolutionary benefits of a cone shaped proto-eye for detecting shadows and shapes. Dawkins then relates this model to the simple pinhole eye structure of a [[nautilus]] [[mollusc]].

The benefit of wing structures is illustrated by way of body flattening behaviour in tree snakes, the web like skin of flying squirrels and similar adaptions to be found on flying lizards.

===Part 4: The Ultraviolet Garden===
{{Expand section|date=October 2007}}
Dawkins begins by relating the story of asking a little girl "what she thought flowers were 'for'." Her response is anthropocentric, that flowers are there for our benefit. Dawkins points out that many people throughout history have thought that the natural world existed for our benefit, with examples from Genesis and other literature. Author [[Douglas Adams]], who is sitting in the audience, is called to read a relevant passage from his novel ''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''.

Dawkins then asks  his audience to put off the idea that the natural world exists for our benefit. He considers the question of flowers seen through the eyes of bees and other pollinators, and performs a series of demonstrations which use ultraviolet light to excite fluorescence in various substances.

===Part 5: The Genesis of Purpose===
{{Expand section|date=May 2011}}
Dawkins opens by talking how organisms “grow up” to understand the universe around them, which requires certain apparatus, such as a [[brain]]. But before brains can become large enough to model the universe they must develop from intermediate forms. Dawkins then discusses the [[Sphex|digger wasp]] and the set of experiments conducted by [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] of how the digger wasp models the local geography around its nest. He then talks about the limitations of the digger wasps’ brain and concludes that only the human brain is sufficiently developed to model large-scale phenomena about the world. He then shows a [[MRI]] scan of a human brain (later revealed to be his own brain) and describes how an image develops from the eye onto the [[visual cortex]].

Dawkins discusses how the image on the [[retina]] is upside-down and in two dimensions but the overlapping images from each of the eyes are [[stereopsis|composited]] to form a three-dimensional model in the brain. He shows this by asking the audience to focus on him while holding their hand at eye level which causes them to see two images of their hand; one from each eye. He then describes how using his finger to wriggle his [[eyeball]] that the outside world appears to move because he is moving the image on his retina. However this does not happen when he voluntary rolls his eyes from side to side. This is due to the brain using the internal model to compensate for the relative change in position of images on the retina. Dawkins gets someone to wear a [[virtual reality]] headset and move around in a 3-D computer generated world and draws an analogy between the model of the universe developed in one’s head with the virtual reality universe developed in the [[computer]].

He then goes on the show that the brain uses models to describe the universe by looking at how the brain interprets various optical illusions, such as the [[hollow-face illusion]] using a rotating hollow mask of [[Charlie Chaplin]], the "impossible" geometry of a [[Penrose triangle]], the shifting interpretations of the [[Necker cube]] and the ability of humans to find [[pareidolia|faces in random shapes]].

Dawkins then begins to discuss the evolution of the human brain. He shows an animation of the increasing skull size from ''[[Australopithecus]]'' to ''[[Homo habilis]]'' to ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and then finally to modern day [[humans]].

The ability of a brain to run complex simulations is a powerful evolutionary advantage. Dawkins talks about how this ability to model future events by showing a painting suggesting a hypothetical situation in which a female ''Homo erectus'' uses a mental model of a tree fallen across a gorge as a possible solution to crossing the gorge. The group then burns a tree so that it would create a bridge over the gap. He goes on to describe how the complex modelling ability of the brain may have developed due to this imaginative simulation of various possible scenarios or by the development of [[language]], which would allow ideas to be passed from generation to generation, or by technology, which is an extension of human hands and eyes; or, indeed, if it is a combination of all three.

Dawkins concludes that purpose has arisen in the [[Universe]] due to human brains. The simulations developed in our brain allow us to develop intent and purpose; and over time our collective understanding of the Universe will improve as we continue to study and exchange ideas.

==Quotations==
{{cquote|Life makes the wonders of technology seem commonplace. So where does life come from? What is it? Why are we here? What are we for? What is the meaning of life? There's a conventional wisdom which says that science has nothing to say about such questions. Well, all I can say is that if science has nothing to say, it's certain that no other discipline can say anything at all. But in fact, science has a great deal to say about such questions. And that's what these five lectures are going to be about. Life "grows up" in the universe by gradual degrees - evolution - and we grow up in our understanding of our origins and our meaning.}}

{{cquote|The present century is a tiny spotlight, inching its way along a gigantic ruler of time. Everything before the spotlight is the darkness of the dead past. Everything after the spotlight is in the darkness of the unknown future. We live in the spotlight. Of all the 200,000,000 centuries along the ruler of time, 199,999,999 centuries are in darkness. Only one is lit up, and that is the one in which we happen - by sheer luck - to be alive. The odds against our century happening to be the present century are the same as the odds against a penny tossed out at random on the road from London to Istanbul happening to fall on a particular ant.}}

{{cquote|We do of course, have an ordinary life to get on with. We do have a living to earn. We've got to earn our living being a solicitor or a lavatory cleaner or something like that. But nevertheless, it is worthwhile also from time to time shaking off the anaesthetic of familiarity and awakening to the wonder that is really all around us all the time.}}

{{cquote|Natural selection - nature - is constantly choosing which individual shall live, [and] which individual shall breed. And the result, after many generations of natural selection, is much the same as the result after many generations of artificial selection.}}

{{cquote|In any case, all creation, all design, all machines and houses and paintings and computers and airplanes, everything designed and made by us, everything made by other creatures, is only made possible because there are already brains put together as designoid objects - and designoid objects come about only through gradual evolution. Creation, when it does occur in the universe, is an afterthought. When creation appeared on this planet it came locally, and it came late. Creation does not belong in any account of the fundamentals of the universe. Creation is something that, rather late in the day, grows up in the universe.}}

==Place==
Jade Mountain should not be confused with any geographic places named [[Yushan (disambiguation)|Yushan]]. Also note, Jade Mountain and Feather Mountain ({{CJKV|t=羽山|s=羽山|p=Yǔshān}}) are both important places in Chinese mythology, but the Chinese word ''yu'' in both cases has a different character.

It has been suggested that the mountain corresponds to a location in the [[Kunlun Mountains]] and that 'jade mountain' is a common Chinese name to describe a snow-capped peak.&lt;ref name=jade&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ye 叶|first=Shuxian 舒宪|date=2014|title=《山海经》与白玉崇拜的起源———黄帝食玉与西王母献白环神话发微|trans-title=The Classic of the Mountains and Seas and the origin of white jade worship: the transmission of the legends of the Yellow Emperor eating jade and the Queen Mother of the West gifting a white bracelet|language=Chinese|journal=Minzu Yishu 民族艺术|issue=6|pages=19–26|doi=10.16564/j.cnki.1003-2568.2014.06.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan de Fuca Channel''' is a [[Deep-Sea Current|submarine channel]] (an [[ocean current]]), off the shore of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state, [[United States|USA]] and the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]].&lt;ref name="Puget Sound’s rich waters supplied by deep, turbulent canyon"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washington.edu/news/2014/04/14/puget-sounds-rich-waters-supplied-by-deep-turbulent-canyon/ | title=Puget Sound's rich waters supplied by deep, turbulent canyon | work=Puget Sound’s rich waters supplied by deep, turbulent canyon | date=April 14, 2014 | accessdate=24 September 2017 | author=Hickey, Hannah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The geography of Juan de Fuca Channel==

The Juan de Fuca Channel is a submarine canyon running from the [[shelf break]], off southern [[Vancouver Island]] to [[Juan de Fuca Strait]].&lt;ref name="On subinertial flow in submarine canyons' Effect of geometry"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://onlinelibrarystatic.wiley.com/store/10.1029/1999JC900240/asset/jgrc7948.pdf?v=1&amp;t=j84onzel&amp;s=c624c73e1a51abe34bcbc83b962f07722b2b98ca&amp;systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+7th+Oct+from+03.00+EDT+%2F+08%3A00+BST+%2F+12%3A30+IST+%2F+15.00+SGT+to+08.00+EDT+%2F+13.00+BST+%2F+17%3A30+IST+%2F+20.00+SGT+and+Sunday+8th+Oct+from+03.00+EDT+%2F+08%3A00+BST+%2F+12%3A30+IST+%2F+15.00+SGT+to+06.00+EDT+%2F+11.00+BST+%2F+15%3A30+IST+%2F+18.00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.+Apologies+for+the+inconvenience+caused+. | title=On subinertial flow in submarine canyons' Effect of geometry | journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans | volume=105 | pages=1285–1297 | date=January 15, 2000 | accessdate=28 September 2017 | author=Allen, Susan E.| doi=10.1029/1999JC900240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canyon is both narrow and deep and has sides that are steep. Over its {{convert|6|km|mi}} width it from at the rim it drops from {{convert|200|m|ft}} depth to over {{convert|500|m|ft}} deep at the [[Thalweg#Hydrology|thalweg]].&lt;ref name="Flow and mixing in Juan de Fuca Canyon, Washington"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://onlinelibrarystatic.wiley.com/store/10.1002/2013GL058967/asset/grl51395.pdf?v=1&amp;t=j8557ai7&amp;s=1d6abea01296862316bec852fcce2a06dcb91524&amp;systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+7th+Oct+from+03.00+EDT+%2F+08%3A00+BST+%2F+12%3A30+IST+%2F+15.00+SGT+to+08.00+EDT+%2F+13.00+BST+%2F+17%3A30+IST+%2F+20.00+SGT+and+Sunday+8th+Oct+from+03.00+EDT+%2F+08%3A00+BST+%2F+12%3A30+IST+%2F+15.00+SGT+to+06.00+EDT+%2F+11.00+BST+%2F+15%3A30+IST+%2F+18.00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.+Apologies+for+the+inconvenience+caused+. |title=Flow and mixing in Juan de Fuca Canyon, Washington |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=1608–1615 |last=Flow and mixing in Juan de Fuca Canyon, Washington|doi=10.1002/2013GL058967 |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along a 350-km track, [[seismic profile]]s over Juan de Fuca Channel show the canyon consists of two distinct parts. The upper canyon is narrow, extends [[southwest]]ward down the continental slope. This area has an average [[Gradient descent|gradient]] of 17 [[meter]]s per [[kilometer|km]]. It is there carved in [[Sedimentary rock|consolidated]] or semiconsolidated material of the slope.&lt;ref name="Submarine canyon flow feeds Strait of Juan de Fuca like an underwater Amazon River"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fondriest.com/news/submarine-canyon-puget-sound-juan-de-fuca.htm | title=Submarine canyon flow feeds Strait of Juan de Fuca like an underwater Amazon River | publisher=Environmental Wanderer | accessdate=24 September 2017 | author=Gillies, Jeff| date=2014-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lower part of the channel trends [[northwest]]ward, parallel to the [[continental shelf|shelf]] edge, with a gradient of only 7 meters per kilometer, terminating at the apex of [[Nitinat fan]]. The lower channel represents a small [[abyssal fan|fan]] and valley feature. Further, Nitinat Fan was constructed on the [[deep-sea floor]] at what is the presently the terminus of Juan de Fuca Channel.&lt;ref name="Seismic reflection profiles across Juan de Fuca Canyon"&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode=1969JGR....74.1052C |title=Seismic reflection profiles across Juan de Fuca Canyon |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=1052 |year=1969|last1=Carson |first1=Bobb |last2=McManus |first2=Dean A. |doi=10.1029/JB074i004p01052 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the shelf break canyons from [[Oregon (state)|Oregon]] and north cross only part of the [[continental shelf]], and cut from the [[shelf break]] toward the coast. Then well below the mixed layer, they end on the continental shelf. Different from other [[abyssal canyon|aquatic canyons]], the Juan de Fuca Channel, cuts the [[continental shelf]] and continues into the Strait of Juan de Fuca&lt;ref name="On subinertial flow in submarine canyons: Effect of geometry"&gt;{{cite journal | title=On subinertial flow in submarine canyons: Effect of geometry |journal = Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans|volume = 105|pages = 1285–1297| date=January 15, 2000 | author=Allen, Susan E.| doi=10.1029/1999JC900240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seismic reflection profiles across Juan de Fuca Canyon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="On subinertial flow in submarine canyons' Effect of geometry"/&gt;

==The amount of water in the channel==

[[File:Amazonrivermap.svg|200px|thumb|The Juan de Fuca Channel carries more water than the [[Amazon River]]. And the Amazon is [[Earth]]'s biggest river, by discharge volume of water.]]

The Juan de Fuca Channel reaches to the opening of the [[Juan de Fuca Strait]], which separates the United States and Canada. The canyon is just less than {{convert|4|mi|km}} wide and at least {{convert|450|yd|m}} deep, that is, twice the depth of the surrounding [[seafloor]].&lt;ref name="Puget Sound’s rich waters supplied by deep, turbulent canyon"/&gt;

===More detail===

For decades, it has been known that 20 to 30 times more [[deep water (ocean)|deep water]] flows into Puget Sound than from all Earth's rivers combined, far bigger than the [[Amazon River]].&lt;ref name="Puget Sound’s rich waters supplied by deep, turbulent canyon"/&gt; This flow is towards land, not away.&lt;ref name="Submarine canyon flow feeds Strait of Juan de Fuca like an underwater Amazon River"/&gt;

New (''as of 2017'')  measurements show this canyon may supply most the water coming into [[Puget Sound]], the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], and Canada’s [[Georgia Strait]].&lt;ref name="Puget Sound’s rich waters supplied by deep, turbulent canyon"/&gt; The pattern of [[water circulation]] sends a dense lower layer of ocean water ''into'' towards land, while the upper layer flows ''out'' to sea.

In the range of 20 to 30 times more [[deep water (ocean)|deep water]] flows into Puget Sound, than combined from all Earth's rivers. [[Tides (ocean)|Tides]] seem be obvious, but play a minor role.&lt;ref name="Puget Sound’s rich waters supplied by deep, turbulent canyon"/&gt;

==Its role==

Juan de Fuca Channel appears to be a [[ocean current|pathway]], bringing deep Pacific water into the [[Salish Sea]].&lt;ref name="Observations of Flow and Mixing in Juan de Fuca Canyon"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cedar.wwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1169&amp;context=ssec |title=Observations of Flow and Mixing in Juan de Fuca Canyon |last=MacCready |first=Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life within==

[[Puget Sound]] has famously [[Marine life|rich water]]. There is reason for this.

The channel pulls [[nutrient]]-rich water from the [[deep ocean]]. Recent [[scientific measurements|measurements]] (''as of 2017'') may explain why this canyon helps support the [[Pacific Northwest]]’s [[inland waters]]  support so many [[shellfish]], [[salmon run]]s and even [[pods of whales]].&lt;ref name="Puget Sound’s rich waters supplied by deep, turbulent canyon"/&gt;

Water surges up the channel, mixing at surprisingly high rates.

The intense [[Ocean Flow|flow]] and mixing measured inside the Juan de Fuca Channel may help explain the formerly mysterious productivity of the shores of Washington. Coastal winds usually bring in some nutrients, but the numbers don’t add up.

"Washington is several times more productive – has more [[phytoplankton]] – than [[Oregon (state)|Oregon]] or [[California (state)|California]], and yet the [[wind]]s here are several times weaker. That’s been kind of a puzzle, for years," observes Matthew Alford, an oceanographer with the [[University of Washington]]'s [[Applied Physics Laboratory]].

At 500 feet below the surface, water has flowed as fast as {{convert|1.3|ft|meter}}s per second, showing mixing up to 1,000 times the normal rate in the [[deep ocean]]. The flow is hydraulically-controlled, which means it flows smoothly over a shallow ridge just off [[Cape Flattery]] then on the other side forms a turbulent breaking [[undersea wave]], mixing with [[surface water]]s far above.

The [[deep water (ocean)|deep water]] forced up through the channel happens to be rich in nutrients, which support the growth of marine plants, which then feed other [[marine life]]. The water is more [[acid]]ic, and lower in [[oxygen]], both of which contribute to water conditions in the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]].&lt;ref name="Puget Sound’s rich waters supplied by deep, turbulent canyon"/&gt;

==Fishing in the Juan de Fuca Ccanyon==

"The location of this [[aquatic sill|sill]] would be an outstanding place to fish," observes Matthew Alford, the oceanographer with the University of Washington’s Applied Physics Laboratory. "People fish in Juan de Fuca Canyon pretty actively, and that’s probably no coincidence."&lt;ref name="Puget Sound’s rich waters supplied by deep, turbulent canyon"/&gt;

[[Nut (fruit)|Nut]] and tree of the [[coco de mer]], a rare species of [[Arecaceae|palm tree]] native to the [[Seychelles]] archipelago in the [[Indian Ocean]], is the subject of various legends and lore. Coco de mer is [[Endemism|endemic]] to the Seychelles islands of [[Praslin]] and [[Curieuse Island|Curieuse]]. Before the Seychelles were discovered and settled, nuts of this species were sometimes carried by the ocean currents to distant shores, such as those of the [[Maldives]], where the tree was unknown. These floating nuts did not [[germinate]]. The exceptional size and suggestive form of the nut, the circumstances of its discovery, and some unusual qualities of the trees have given rise to several legends.

==Context==
The nut of the coco de mer is very large (the largest seed in the plant kingdom) and is oddly shaped, being the shape and size of a woman's disembodied [[buttocks]] on one side, and a woman's belly and thighs on the other side. Not surprisingly, this nut was viewed by people in other parts of the world as a rare and fascinating object with [[mythological]] and even [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] properties. The nature and origin of this extraordinary nut was mysterious, and the [[plant propagation|propagation]] of the tree was not understood. A number of legends arose both about the nuts, and about the trees that produce them.

The coco de mer palm has separate male and female trees, unlike the [[coconut]] palm. And, unlike the more familiar fruit of the coconut tree, the coco de mer fruit is not adapted to disperse naturally by floating on the ocean water. When a coco de mer fruit falls into the sea, it cannot float because of its great weight and density; instead it sinks to the bottom. However, after the fruit has been on the sea bed for a considerable period of time, the husk drops off, the internal parts of the nut decay, and  the gases that form inside the nut cause the bare nut to rise up to the surface. At that time the nut can float, but is no longer [[fertility|fertile]], thus when the ocean currents cause the nut to wash up on a distant beach, for example in the Maldives, a tree cannot, and does not, grow from the nut. The name coco de mer is [[French language|French]], and means "coconut of the sea".

==Legends predating the discovery of the Seychelles==
[[Malay Peninsula|Malay]] seamen had seen coco de mer nuts "falling upwards" from the sea bed, and so they had reasoned that these nuts must grow on underwater trees, in a forest at the bottom of the [[Indian Ocean]]. According  to [[Antonio Pigafetta]]  and [[Georg Eberhard Rumphius]], Malay people believed  that the tree was also the home of the huge bird or bird-like creature [[Garuda]] (or [[Roc (mythology)|Rukh]] of the Arabs).&lt;ref name="Hobson-Jobson"/&gt; African priests believed that the Garuda was capable of hunting [[elephant]]s and [[tiger]]s. The [[Africa]]n priests also believe that sometimes the coco de mer trees rose up above the ocean surface, and when this happened, the waves that the trees created did not allow any ship nearby to sail away and the helpless sailors were eaten by the Garuda.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; 
[[File:Valleé de mai at Praslin.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Coco de Mar trees at the [[Vallée de Mai]] Nature Reserve]]

The nuts that were found in the ocean and on the beaches no longer had a [[husk]],  and resembled the dismembered lower part of a [[woman]]'s body, including the buttocks. This association is reflected in one of the plant's archaic botanical names, ''Lodoicea callipyge'' Comm. ex J. St.-Hil., in which ''callipyge'' is from the Greek words meaning "beautiful rump". Historically these floating "beautiful rumps" were collected and sold for a fortune in [[Arabia]] and in [[Europe]].

In the [[Maldives]], any coco de mer nuts that were found in the ocean or on the beaches were supposed to be given to the king, and keeping a nut for yourself or selling it could have resulted in the death penalty.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; However, [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] was able to purchase one of these nuts for 4,000 gold [[Florin (Italian coin)|florin]]s. The Dutch Admiral [[Wolfert Hermanssen]] also received a nut as a gift for his services, from the [[Sultanate of Banten|Sultan of Bantam]] in 1602, for fighting the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and protecting the capital of Bantam. However, the nut that the admiral was given was missing the top part; apparently the Sultan had ordered the top of the nut to be cut off, in order not to upset the noble admiral’s modesty.&lt;ref name="The Islands Of Paradise"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West Australian Nutgrowing Society"/&gt; [[João de Barros]] believed that coco de mer possessed amazing healing powers, superior even to those of "the precious stone [[Bezoar]]".&lt;ref name="West Australian Nutgrowing Society"/&gt; In one of his books, Dr.&amp;nbsp;[[Berthold Carl Seemann]] mentioned that many believed the nuts to be an antidote to all poisons.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; The nuts were praised not only by scientists and [[botanist]]s, but also by poets. [[Luís de Camões]] wrote: 
{{cquote|O'er lone Maldivia's islets grows the plant,&lt;br/&gt;beneath profoundest seas, of sov'reign might,&lt;br/&gt;whose [[pome]] of ev'ry [[Theriac]]k is confest,&lt;br/&gt;by cunning leech&lt;ref&gt;''Leech'': an archaic term for doctor.&lt;/ref&gt; of antidotes the best &lt;ref name="Works, Volume 2 By Luís de Camões"/&gt;}}

In 1769, [[Jean Duchemin]] sailed to [[Praslin]], the second largest island in the Seychelles, on the ship ''L’Heureuse Marie''. He loaded up with a cargo of these unusual nuts, which he later sold in [[India]]n markets. After his trip, coco de mer nuts never again held the same extraordinary value.&lt;ref name="West Australian Nutgrowing Society"/&gt;

==Legends after the discovery of the Seychelles==
[[File:Male and female coco-de-mer.jpg|350px|thumb|Photo collage showing the female [[coco de mer]] fruit with no [[husk]] as well as the male coco de mer [[catkin]]]]
New legends about the coco de mer came into existence after 1743, when the real coco de mer trees were discovered. Fruits of coco de mer are developed only on female trees. Male trees have long [[phallic]]-looking [[catkin]]s. Because of these unusual, [[erotic]] shapes, some people believed that the trees made passionate love on stormy nights.  According to the legend, male trees uproot themselves, and approach female trees. Apparently the love-making trees are rather shy, and the legend has it that whoever sees the trees mating will die or go blind. The fact that even  now the [[pollination]] of the coco de mer is not fully understood, is one of the factors behind the legend.&lt;ref name="Praslin's marvelous Coco de Mer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOVA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph"/&gt;

In the [[Victorian era]], General [[Charles George Gordon]], who visited the [[Seychelles]] in 1881, believed that the [[Vallée de Mai]] on the island of [[Praslin]] was the original [[Garden of Eden]] as described in the [[Bible]], and that the coco de mer was the [[forbidden fruit]] of the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]].&lt;ref name="Nature's strongholds"/&gt; General Gordon wrote:
{{cquote|externally the coco-de-mer represents the belly and thighs, the true seat of carnal desires&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph1"/&gt;}}
It occurred to at least some of Gordon's readers that if coco de mer was really the forbidden fruit, [[Eve]] would have had a very hard time handing this gigantic fruit (which weighs 15–30&amp;nbsp;kg) to [[Adam]].&lt;ref name="Wit, Wisdom and Foibles of the Great"/&gt;

'''''[[Berberis]]''''' and '''''[[Mahonia]]''''' are two widespread and common members of the [[Berberidaceae]], found in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;Ahrendt, Leslie Walter Allen. 1961. Journal of the Linnean Society 57: 1-410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loconte, H., &amp; J. R. Estes. 1989. Phylogenetic systematics of Berberidaceae and Ranunculales (Magnoliidae).

Pl. 1: 330. 1753. ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCain, J. W. and J. F. Hennen. 1982. Is the taxonomy of ''Berberis'' and ''Mahonia'' (Berberidaceae) supported by their rust pathogens ''Cumminsiella santa'' sp. nov. and other ''Cumminsiella'' species (Uredinales)? Systematic Botany 7: 48-59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moran, R. V. 1982. ''Berberis claireae'', a new species from Baja California; and why not ''Mahonia''. Phytologia 52: 221-226.&lt;/ref&gt; Botanists have for many years had no consensus on the classification, some preferring to treat the group as a single genus (''[[Berberis]]''), while others opt to separate the two groups into distinct genera. Therefore, many species have two scientific name, one in ''Berberis'', the other in ''Mahonia'', each used by botanists on one side the debate.

A third generic name, ''[[Odostemon]]'', can be found in older literature. It is considered by most authorities to be a rejected synonym for ''Mahonia'', yet [[the Plant List]] does accept a few species in this genus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Odostemon+ The Plant List, search for ''Odostemon'']&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an old argument not likely to be resolved soon, and certainly not here on Wikipedia. Our interest is in assisting readers find the web pages on the appropriate species, despite the dual nomenclature. Below are species accepted by The Plant List as members of one genus or the other, all alphabetized by specific epithet with links to synonyms in the other genus, if such a synonym exists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=berberis The Plant List, search for ''Berberis'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=mahonia The Plant List, search for ''Mahonia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Euphorbia]]'' is a highly diverse [[plant]] [[genus]], comprising some 5,000 currently accepted taxa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tropicos.org/NameSearch.aspx?name=Euphorbia Tropicos - Name Search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an alphabetical '''list of the ''Euphorbia'' species''' and notable infraspecific [[taxa]].

The list includes the former (and never generally accepted) genus ''Chamaesyce'', as well as the related genera ''Elaeophorbia'', ''Endadenium'', ''Monadenium'', ''Synadenium'' and ''Pedilanthus'' which according to recent [[DNA sequence]]-based [[phylogenetic]] studies are all nested within ''Euphorbia''&lt;ref name = dnaphylogeny&gt;Steinmann &amp; Porter (2002), Steinmann (2003), Bruyns ''et al.''

{{Dynamic list|date=April 2015}}

The following is a list of notable [[galaxy|galaxies]].

There are about 51 galaxies in the [[Local Group]] (see [[list of nearest galaxies]] for a complete list), on the order of 100,000 in our [[Virgo Supercluster|Local Supercluster]] and an estimated number of about one to two trillion in all of the [[observable universe]].

The discovery of the nature of galaxies as distinct from other [[nebula]]e ([[interstellar cloud]]s) was made [[Great Debate (astronomy)|in the 1920s]]. The first attempts at systematic catalogues of galaxies were made in the 1960s, with the [[Catalogue of Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies]] listing 29,418 galaxies and galaxy clusters, and with the [[Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies]], a putatively complete '''list of galaxies''' with [[photographic magnitude]] above 15, listing 30,642. In the 1980s, the [[Lyons Groups of Galaxies]] listed 485 galaxy groups with 3,933 member galaxies. [[Galaxy Zoo]] is a project aiming at a more comprehensive list: launched in July 2007, it has classified over one million galaxy images from The Sloan Digital Sky Survey, The Hubble Space Telescope and the Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey.&lt;ref name=GZ_numbers&gt;{{cite journal| first=B.D. |last=Simmons| display-authors=etal| title=Galaxy Zoo: CANDELS barred discs and bar fractions| date=2014| journal=MNRAS| volume=445| issue=4| bibcode=2014MNRAS.445.3466S| doi=10.1093/mnras/stu1817| pages=3466–3474|arxiv = 1409.1214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no universal naming convention for galaxies, as they are mostly catalogued before it is established whether the object is or isn't a galaxy. Mostly they are identified by their celestial coordinates together with the name of the observing project ([[Hubble Ultra-Deep Field|HUDF]], [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]], [[Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources|3C]], [[Canada-France-Hawaii High-z Quasar Survey|CFHQS]], [[New General Catalogue|NGC/IC]], etc.)

|[[File:Andromeda Galaxy (with h-alpha).jpg|frameless|upright=.32]]
|[[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda]]
|&lt;small&gt;[[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]&lt;/small&gt;
|''Andromeda'', which is shortened from "Andromeda Galaxy", gets its name from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda.
|Andromeda is the closest big galaxy to the [[Milky Way]] and is expected to collide with the Milky Way around 4 billion years from now.  The two will eventually merge into a single new galaxy called [[Milkomeda]].
|-
|[[File:Blackeyegalaxy.jpg|frameless|upright=.32]]
|[[Black Eye Galaxy]]
|&lt;small&gt;[[Coma Berenices]]&lt;/small&gt;
|It has a spectacular dark band of absorbing dust in front of the galaxy's bright nucleus, giving rise to its nicknames of the "Black Eye" or "Evil Eye" galaxy.

|
* [[Milky Way Galaxy]]
* [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]
* [[Small Magellanic Cloud]]
| 
| The [[Magellanic Clouds]] are being tidally disrupted by the [[Milky Way Galaxy]], resulting in the [[Magellanic Stream]] drawing a tidal tail away from the LMC and SMC, and the [[Magellanic Bridge]] drawing material from the clouds to our galaxy.

| 
* [[Messier 51]] ([[Arp 85]])
* [[Whirlpool Galaxy]] ([[NGC 5194]], [[M51a]])
* [[NGC 5195]] ([[M51b]])
| 
| The smaller galaxy NGC 5195 is tidally interacting with the larger Whirlpool Galaxy, creating its [[grand design spiral galaxy]] architecture. 
|-
| 
* [[Messier 81|M81]]
* [[Messier 82|M82]]
* [[NGC 3077]]
| 
| These three galaxies interact with each other and draw out tidal tails, which are dense enough to form star clusters. The bridge of gas between these galaxies is known as [[Arp's Loop]].&lt;ref&gt;Sky and Telescope, [http://www.skyandtelescope.com/community/skyblog/newsblog/13685257.html Stars in the Middle of Nowhere], 10 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mount Wilhelm.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Wilhelm]], highest peak of [[Papua New Guinea]]]]
This '''list of highest mountains of New Guinea''' shows all mountains on the island of [[New Guinea]] that are at least 3750&amp;nbsp;m high and have a [[topographic prominence]] of 500&amp;nbsp;m or more. These {{circa}} 50 peaks are also the '''highest mountains of [[Australasia]]''', where, outside New Guinea, the highest mountain is [[Aoraki / Mount Cook]] in New Zealand with a height of 3724 m.&lt;ref&gt;Aoraki was 3764 m high until 14 December 1991, when a massive rock/ice collapse broke off 10 meters. Subsequent erosion of the exposed ice cap reduced its height by a further 30 m as of November 2013.[http://www.otago.ac.nz/news/news/otago062651.html]&lt;/ref&gt; A list of '''highest mountains of [[Oceania]]''' with the same limitations is almost identical, with the addition of the Hawaiian volcanoes of [[Mauna Kea]] (4205 m) and [[Mauna Loa]] (4169 m) in 18th and 20th positions. The list also shows the 36 highest thus defined '''mountains of [[Indonesia]]''', except for the 3805 m high [[Gunung Kerinci]] on [[Sumatra]] (#29 in Indonesia), and the 16 '''highest mountains of [[Papua New Guinea]]'''.

==Limited topographical data==
Many mountains in New Guinea are poorly surveyed and some major summits remain unnamed on maps. 
Even well measured mountains have conflicting heights on otherwise authoritative maps. For example, the highest point in Oceania, [[Carstensz Pyramid]], was established to be 4884&amp;nbsp;m in 1973 when an Australian survey expedition put a beacon on the summit. This corresponded closely to the 4866&amp;nbsp;m estimate by the first [[Lorentsz Expedition]] in 1910 using repeated [[theodolite]] observations from the south coast. However, over time the mountain had grown in stature: measurements from northern observation peaks for the highest summit (each time Ngga Pulu) were 5000&amp;nbsp;m in 1910 by [[Ludolph Doorman]] and 5030&amp;nbsp;m in 1926 by [[Charles C.F.M. Le Roux]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles C.F.M. Le Roux, [http://www.papuaerfgoed.org/files/Le_Roux(I)_1948_Bergpapoea.pdf The Mountain Papuas of New Guinea and their environment], Volume 1, Leiden 1948, pp. 40 &amp; 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1936 [[Carstensz Expedition]] using barometric and boiling point measurements on the summit of Ngga Pulu also derived an elevation of 5030&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://7summits.com/pix/carstensz/pix/colijnmapbig7s2.jpg Colijn's map of the 1936 expedition].&lt;/ref&gt; After ascending the Pyramid in 1962, [[Heinrich Harrer]] even estimated that peak to be 17,096 feet or 5211&amp;nbsp;m high.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Harrer's [http://7summits.com/pix/carstensz/pix/hhcarmapnorm7s.gif sketch map] from ''Ich komme aus der Steinzeit''. Pinguin, Innsbruck 1976, {{ISBN|3-524-00331-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1973 survey established that the 1936 barometric estimates were consistently between 118 and 127&amp;nbsp;m too high. Nevertheless, the 5030&amp;nbsp;m height is still prevalent in most atlases and maps.&lt;ref&gt;Edward G. Anderson, [http://www.papuaweb.org/dlib/bk/hope1976/02.pdf Topographic survey and cartography], in Hope, Geoff S, et al (Editors) 1976, [http://www.papuaweb.org/dlib/bk/hope1976/ The Equatorial Glaciers of New Guinea] (Results of the 1971-1973 Australian Universities' Expeditions to Irian Jaya: survey, glaciology, meteorology, biology and palaeoenvironments), Rotterdam: A.A.

==Disappearing and disappeared glaciers of the Snowy Mountains ==
All mountains in [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]] are in the [[Maoke Mountains]], a translation of the name “Sneeuwgebergte” or '''Snowy Mountains''' endowed to them in 1623 by [[Jan Carstensz]], at which time many of the peaks indeed were covered by extensive ice caps. By the beginning of the 20th century, at least five such glaciated regions remained on the highest mountains. In 1913, the 4520–4550&amp;nbsp;m high Prins Hendrik-top (now [[Puncak Yamin]]) was named and reported to have some "eternal" snow.&lt;ref&gt;E.J. Brill, Tijdschrift van het Koninklijk Nederlandsch Aardrijkskundig Genootschap, 1913, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; The ice cap of [[Puncak Trikora|Wilhelmina Peaks]] vanished between 1939 and 1963, while the [[Puncak Mandala|Mandala / Juliana]] ice cap disappeared in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, A.G., Kincaid, J.L., 2008. On the disappearance of the Puncak Mandala ice cap, Papua.

[[Image:Klassieren.jpg|thumb|200px|Monocrystalline solar cell]]
This is a '''list of notable photovoltaics (PV) companies'''. 
 
Grid-connected solar [[photovoltaics]] (PV) is the fastest growing energy technology in the world, growing from a cumulative installed capacity of 7.7 GW in 2007, to 320 GW in 2016. In 2016, 93% of the global PV cell manufacturing capacity utilizes crystalline silicon (cSi) technology, representing a commanding lead over rival forms of PV technology, such as cadmium telluride (CdTe), amorphous silicon (aSi), and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS). In 2016, manufacturers in China and Taiwan met the majority of global PV module demand, accounting for 68% of all modules, followed by the rest of Asia at 14%. The United States and Canada manufactured 6%, and Europe manufactured a mere 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/ise/de/documents/publications/studies/Photovoltaics-Report.pdf|title=Fraunhofer Photovoltaic Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photovoltaics companies include PV capital equipment producers, [[solar cell|cell manufacturers]], [[solar panel|panel]] manufacturers and installers. The list does not include [[silicon]] manufacturing companies.

Solar modules, as the final products to be installed to generate electricity, are regarded as the major components to be selected by customers willing to choose solar PV energy. Solar module manufacturers must be sure that their products can be sustainable for application periods of more than 25 years. As a result, major solar module producers have their products tested by publicly recognized testing organizations and guarantee their durable efficiency rate for a certain number of years. The solar PV market has been growing for the past few years. According to solar PV research company [http://www.pvinsights.com PVinsights], worldwide shipments of solar modules in 2011 was around 25 GW, and the shipment year-over-year growth was around 40%. The top five solar module producers in 2011 were: Suntech, First Solar, Yingli, Trina, and Canadian. The top five solar module companies possessed 51.3% market share of solar modules, according to PVinsights' market intelligence report.

'''Top 10 solar cell producers'''

According to an annual market survey by the photovoltaics trade publication ''Photon International'', global production of photovoltaic cells and modules in 2009 was 12.3 GW. The top ten manufacturers accounted for 45% of this total.&lt;ref name=global&gt;Hirshman, W. P., "Surprise, surprise (cell production 2009: survey)," [http://www.photon-magazine.com Photon International], (March 2010), pp. 176-199.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2010, a tremendous growth of solar PV cell shipments doubled the solar PV cell market size. According to the solar PV market research company PVinsights,&lt;ref name="pvinsights.com"/&gt; Suntech topped the ranking of solar cell production. Most of the top ten solar PV producers doubled their shipment in 2010 and five of them were over one gigawatt shipments. The top ten solar cell producers dominated the market with an even higher market share, say 50~60%, with respect to an assumed twenty gigawatt cell shipments in 2010.

'''Quarterly ranking'''

Although yearly ranking is as listed above, quarterly ranking can indicate which company can sustain particular conditions such as severet price adjustment, government feed-in tariff change, and weather conditions. In 2Q11, First Solar regained the top spot in solar module shipments from Suntech. From the 2Q11 results, four phenomena should be noticed: thin film leader First Solar still dominates; more centralization in the solar module market; Chinese companies soared; and the giga-watt game is prevailing (according to the latest solar model shipment report by PVinsigts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pvinsights.com/Report/ReportPMM31A.php|title=PVinsights: Solar PV Module Shipment Ranking Reports in 2Q11|website=pvinsights.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar photovoltaic production by country==
China now manufactures more than half of the world's solar photovoltaics. Its production has been rapidly escalating. In 2001 it had less than 1% of the world market. In contrast, in 2001 Japan and the United States combined had over 70% of world production. By 2011 they produced around 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US-China Solar Trade Case Background|url=http://www.futureofuschinatrade.com/article/us-china-solar-trade-case-background|publisher=FutureofUSChinaTrade.com|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chelonoidis nigra''''' (the [[Galápagos tortoise]]) is a tortoise [[species complex]] endemic to the [[Galápagos Islands]]. It includes at least 12, and possibly up to 15, [[species]].&lt;ref name='ReferenceA'&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3094648 |author=Caccone |year=2002 |title=Phylogeography and history of the giant Galapagos tortoises |journal=Evolution |volume=56|issue=10|pages=2052–2066 |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb00131.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only twelve species now exist: one on each of the islands of [[Santiago Island (Galápagos)|Santiago]], [[Santa Cruz Island (Galápagos)|Santa Cruz]], [[San Cristóbal Island|San Cristóbal]], [[Pinzón Island|Pinzón]], and [[Española Island|Española]]; one on each of the five main volcanoes of the largest island, [[Isabela Island (Galápagos)|Isabela]] ([[Volcán Wolf|Wolf]], Darwin, [[Alcedo Volcano|Alcedo]], [[Sierra Negra (Galápagos)|Sierra Negra]], and [[Cerro Azul (Ecuador volcano)|Cerro Azul]]); and one, ''[[Geochelone nigra abingdoni|abingdoni]]'' from Pinta Island, which is considered [[extinct]] as of June 24, 2012. The species inhabiting [[Floreana Island]] (''Chelonoidis nigra'') is thought to have been hunted to extinction by 1850,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Broom |year=1929 |title=On the extinct Galápagos tortoise that inhabited Charles Island |work=Zoologica |pages=9:313–320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='S1986'&gt;{{citation|url=https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/5333/SCtZ-0413-Lo_res.pdf |author=Steadman |year=1986 |title=Holocene vertebrate fossils from Isla Floreana, Galápagos |work=Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology |number=413 |pages=1–103 |DOI=10.5479/si.00810282.413}}&lt;/ref&gt; only years after [[Charles Darwin]]'s landmark visit of 1835 in which he saw carapaces but no live tortoises on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Sulloway 1984.

Biological taxonomy is not fixed, and placement of taxa is reviewed as a result of new research. The current categorization of species of ''Chelonoidis nigra'' is shown below. Also included are synonyms, which are now discarded duplicate or incorrect namings. Common names are given but may vary, as they have no set meaning.

|  | [[Lonesome George]], the last living member, died June 2012. This species was severely depleted by whalers and fishermen, and the introduction of goats in 1958 resulted in massive destruction of vegetation. The carapace is shaped like a saddle, very narrow, compressed, and slightly upturned anteriorly, and wider and lower posteriorly with a rounded margin.

|  | {{lsc11amp|1139}} individuals. Northern Isabela (Albermarle) Island, northern and western slopes of Volcano Wolf.

Recent research indicates that the variation is caused by hybridization of native Isabela tortoises with about 40 descendents of tortoises from Floreana, a population thought to be extinct since the 1850s.&lt;ref name="live"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16467397 Extinct tortoise 'can live again'].

|  | Heavily exploited and completely eliminated over much of its original range. Trampling of nests by feral donkeys, and the predation of young by feral dogs decimated populations, but the breeding program had led to successful releases. It has a wide, black shell, its shape intermediate between the saddlebacked and domed species: adult males are rather saddlebacked, but females and young males are wider in the middle and more domed. A now extinct, more flat-shelled form occurred throughout the wetter and higher regions of the island most altered by man when the island was colonized. The type specimen was from this extinct population, so it is possible that the species currently designated ''C. chathamensis'' is mistakenly applied.&lt;ref name='P1979'/&gt;

|  | Large numbers of tortoises were removed from the island in the early nineteenth century by [[whaling]] vessels, and introduced goats reduced the coastal lowlands to deserts, restricting the remaining tortoises to the interior. The sex ratio is strongly imbalanced in favour of the males and most nests and young are destroyed by [[feral]] pigs. Some nests are now protected by lava corrals and since 1970 eggs have been transported to the Charles Darwin Research Station for hatching and rearing. Release programs and measures for nest protection from feral pigs have been successful.&lt;ref name='Cayot 1994'&gt;Cayot 1994.

The wild reproduction is successful in the east but in the western-southwestern area pigs, dogs, rats and cats are present as [[predator]]s. It is one of the most threatened of the existing species, and 20 adults were taken into captivity for a breeding program in 1998 following the threat of a volcanic eruption from the nearby Cerro Azul Volcano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tortoise.org/news/1998s29.html |title=Turtle Action News |publisher=Tortoise.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species is intermediate in shape between domed and saddlebacked, with a distinctive 'tabletop' appearance.

The 2 males and 11 females were initially brought to the Darwin Station. Fortuitously, a third male was discovered at the San Diego Zoo and joined the others in a captive breeding program.

'''Michael Wutky''' (1739, [[Krems an der Donau]] - 28 September 1822/23, [[Vienna]]) was an Austrian landscape painter in the [[Rococo]] style who specialized in Italian scenes.

==Biography==
In 1759, he studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna]], with [[Martin van Meytens]].&lt;ref name="B"&gt;[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/BLK%C3%96:Wutky,_Michael Brief biography] from the [[Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich]] @ German Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt;
He was originally a [[history painter]], but was not very successful. In 1770, he became a member of the Academy and went to Italy on its behalf. Once there, he turned to landscape painting, which proved to be his true forté.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie|44|379|379|Wuttky, Michael|Hermann Arthur Lier|ADB:Wuttky, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He is best known for the paintings he produced during a stay in [[Naples]]. [[Mount Vesuvius]] was especially active at that time, and he took the opportunity to capture close-up scenes of the eruptions and lava flows.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; Accompanied by the English diplomat and [[volcanologist]], [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]], he even made risky trips close to the volcano's crater. Until the advent of photography, his paintings were considered to be the most scientifically accurate representations of a volcanic eruption.

He later spent some time painting the ruins in Rome, then returned to Vienna, where he became a Professor at the Academy. He revisited Italy for a short time in 1805, to collect new material.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; His stepbrother, Franz Neumann (1744-1816), the Director of the "Royal Coin and Antiquities Gallery", left him 40,000 [[Florin]]s, but he continued to earn his living by painting. Many years earlier, [[Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol|Lord Bristol]] had offered to buy two of his Italian landscapes for 1,200 [[Ducat]]s apiece, but died before the sale was completed.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

[[File:Colophospermum mopane - Seeds.jpg|thumb|right|The fruit are [[legume]]s which contain one seed each]]

'''''Colophospermum mopane''''', commonly called '''mopane''',&lt;ref name=GRIN&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate = 15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''mophane, mopani''',{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} '''balsam tree''',&lt;ref name=GRIN/&gt; '''butterfly tree''',&lt;ref name=GRIN/&gt; or '''turpentine tree''',&lt;ref name=GRIN/&gt; is a tree in the [[legume]] family ([[Fabaceae]]), that grows in hot, dry, low-lying areas, {{convert|200|to|1150|m|ft}} in elevation, in the far northern parts of [[southern Africa]]. The tree only occurs in Africa and is the only [[species]] in [[genus]] ''Colophospermum''. Its distinctive [[butterfly]]-shaped (bifoliate) leaf and thin [[legume|seed pod]] make it easy to identify. In terms of human use it is, together with [[Acacia erioloba|camel thorn]] and [[Combretum imberbe|leadwood]], one of the three regionally important [[firewood]] trees.

==Range and habit==
It is native to [[Angola]] and [[Malawi]]. It is found growing in [[alkali soil|alkaline]] (high lime content) soils which are shallow and not well drained. It also grows in alluvial soils (soil deposited by rivers). In small portions of South Africa and larger adjacent areas of Botswana and Zimbabwe, the trees tend to vary between {{convert|4|and|18|m|ft|abbr=on}}, often called "mopane scrub" ([[shrub]]) but also sometimes taller and forming woodland, where further north the trees are taller and form tall woodlands referred to as cathedral mopane. This tree does not grow well outside hot, frost-free areas with summer rainfall.

===Mopane ecoregions===
There are two [[ecoregion]]s where mopane is the predominant vegetation. The [[Angolan Mopane woodlands]] are in southwestern Angola and northern Namibia, and the [[Zambezian and mopane woodlands]] extend over the lowlands of the [[Zambezi River]] and its tributaries in Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi, South Africa, and Swaziland.

== Uses ==
[[File:Mopane worm on mopane tree.jpg|thumb|[[Gonimbrasia belina|Mopane worm]] on a mopane branch. Immediately below the caterpillar, a pair of distinctive, butterfly-shaped leaves have survived.]]

[[File:Mophane_leaf.jpg|thumb|Mopane butterfly shaped leaf]]
Mopane wood is one of southern Africa's heaviest and is difficult to work because of its hardness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wood-database.com/lumber-identification/hardwoods/mopane/ The Wood Database] Mopane. Retrieved 24 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this also makes it [[termite]] resistant. For this reason it has long been used for building houses and fences, as railway sleepers and as [[mining|pit props]]. The termite-resistance and rich, reddish colouring also make it popular for flooring. Outside Africa, mopane is gaining popularity as a heavy, decorative wood, its uses including aquarium ornaments, bases for lamps or sculptures, and garden accents.
[[File:Mopane_seed_and_leaves.JPG|thumb|Mopane in Namibia]]

It is also increasingly being used in the construction of musical instruments, particularly [[woodwind instruments|woodwind]]. Suitable quality African blackwood (''[[Dalbergia melanoxylon]]''), traditionally used for [[clarinet]]s, is becoming harder to find. Mopane is fairly oily, seasons very well with few splits or shakes, and produces instruments of a warm, rich tone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prosono.co.za/en/woods-for-woodwinds.shtml Prosono International] Woods for woodwinds. Retrieved 23 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mopane twigs have been traditionally used as tooth brushes, bark to make twine and for [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]], and leaves for healing wounds. The wood is also used to make charcoal and for [[braai]] wood.

The tree is a major food source for the mopane worm, the [[caterpillar]] of the [[moth]] ''[[Gonimbrasia belina]]''. The caterpillars are rich in protein and are eaten by people. The tree also acts as a foodplant for a [[wild silk]] moth, ''[[Gonometa|Gonometa rufobrunnea]]''. Cocoons of the moth are harvested as wild [[silk]], to make cloth.

The mopane tree also serves as a host plant for the mopane [[Psyllidae|psyllid]] ''Retroacizzia mopani''.&lt;ref&gt;Oppong, C.K., Addo-Bediako, A., Potgieter, M.J. &amp; Wessels, D.C.J. 2009.

==Etymology==
''Colophospermum'' is Latinised Greek for "oily seed", in reference to the [[resin]]ous [[seed]] (i.e. ''spermum'') which has a [[turpentine]] smell. [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]] was the birthplace of [[Homer]] in [[Ionia]], and was famous for its [[rosin]], a substance obtained from turpentine or the gummy exudate of some trees.&lt;ref&gt;A reference to the species' resinous seed: 'Origins and Meanings of Names of South African Plant Genera' - W.P.U. Jackson (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; The species name ''mopane'' is taken from the local name for the tree.

[[File:LocationTrinidadAndTobago.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Location of Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean|alt=map of Caribbean with Trinidad and Tobago highlighted]]
Trinidad and Tobago are continental islands with a geologically very recent history of direct land bridge connection to South America. As a result, unlike most of the Caribbean Islands, Trinidad and Tobago supports a primarily [[South America]]n [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] and has greater diversity of plant and animal species than the [[Antilles]]. However, rates of [[endemic (ecology)|endemism]] are lower than in the rest of the Caribbean because there has been less time for genetic isolation from mainland populations because of the history of land bridge connections and hence fewer opportunities for speciation, and so a greater proportion of the species in Trinidad and Tobago are also found on the South American mainland. Trinidad is nearer to mainland South America and has been directly connected to the mainland via land bridges more often and for longer periods than Tobago. This, as well as Trinidad's larger size and more varied topography and hydrology compared to that of Tobago allow greater species and ecosystem diversity on the former compared to that on the later of the islands.

== Terrestrial animal communities ==

=== Mammals ===
: ''See also:'' [[List of mammals of Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Hunting#Trinidad_and_Tobago]]

Trinidad and Tobago is home to about 99 species of terrestrial mammals. About 65 of the mammalian species in the islands are bats (including cave roosting, tree and cavity roosting bats and even foliage-tent-making bats; all with widely differing diets from nectar and fruit, to insects, small vertebrates such as fish, frogs, small birds and rodents and even those that consume vertebrate blood). The next most diverse group of mammals in the islands are the rodents. The largest of these rodents are the [[lowland paca]], the [[Brazilian porcupine]], and the [[red-rumped agouti]] (of these, only the agouti remains extant on Tobago). One squirrel (the [[red-tailed squirrel]]) and several native rats and mice are also part of the rodent fauna. A few species of opossums including the [[common opossum]] may be found on both islands. Two anteaters, the [[southern tamandua]] and the [[silky anteater]] are found in Trinidad (but not in Tobago). The [[nine-banded armadillo]] can still be found on both islands. Native mammals of the order [[Carnivora]] include the [[ocelot]], the [[tayra]], the [[Neotropical river otter]] and the [[crab-eating raccoon]] (all four being found on Trinidad, with only the raccoon still extant on Tobago). The [[small Asian mongoose]] was introduced to Trinidad (but not to Tobago) during the later part of the 19th century and is now [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]]. The two native hoofed-mammals still found in Trinidad include the [[red brocket]] deer and the [[collared peccary]] (in Tobago, the deer is thought to be extirpated and the peccary is now fairly rare). The [[Guyanan red howler|red howler monkey]] and the [[white-fronted capuchin]] are Trinidad's two native non-human primate species. The [[tufted capuchin]] monkey was introduced to the northwestern peninsula of Trinidad during World War II and is now naturalized there. No monkeys remain extant on Tobago. For comments on native aquatic mammals (namely manatees) and native marine mammals (whales and dolphins), see the appropriate sections below.

=== Birds ===

[[File:Trinidad and Tobago hummingbirds composite.jpg|thumb|hummingbirds of Trinidad and Tobago]]
: ''See also: [[List of birds of Trinidad and Tobago]]''

472 species of birds have been recorded in Trinidad and Tobago (and the list of recorded species seems be still slowly increasing from year to year). There are few places in the world where so many birds can be seen in such a small area (with probably one of the highest bird species to area ratios of any country). Many of the species are very rare or are of particular interest. They range from the many species of [[hummingbird]]s to the primitive cave-dwelling [[oilbird]] (that uses sonar to fly in the dark) to the spectacularly beautiful [[scarlet ibis]]. The islands are within a few miles of [[Venezuela]], and the species are therefore typical of tropical [[South America]]. However, the variety (although quite exceptional for such a small geographic area) is somewhat impoverished compared to the mainland, as would be expected with small islands.

The resident breeding birds are augmented in the northern winter by [[bird migration|migrants]] from [[North America]].

Tobago has only about half the number of bird species of Trinidad, but about 22 birds have been reported only from Tobago, including 12 breeding species.

The country hosts a few endemic avian subspecies and two endemic species (the critically endangered [[Trinidad Piping Guan]] found only in Trinidad, and the [[Trinidad Motmot]] found on both islands, but more common in Tobago).

===Amphibians and reptiles ===
: '' See also: [[List of snakes of Trinidad and Tobago]]''

The best sources of information regarding the recorded amphibians and reptiles of Trinidad and Tobago to date are Murphy (1997) and Boos (2001). Since those publications, a few new records as well as several taxonomic changes have been made (Murphy and Downie, 2012). The herpetofaunal list is at present in a state of flux, as taxonomy and systematics continue to be revised. To date (July 2014), the generally accepted recorded numbers of species of the various major groups of amphibians and reptiles are as follows:

Frogs and toads ([[Anura (frog)|Anura]]): 37 species in total for the country.  (33 recorded from Trinidad and 15 recorded on Tobago, with 4 of those from Tobago not known from Trinidad, and 2 of those from Trinidad known from just one specimen each. There is one introduced species, known on both Trinidad and Tobago).

Caecilians ([[Gymnophonia]]): 1 species in total from Trinidad only. (Recorded from only 1 specimen).

Turtles, terrapins and tortoises ([[Turtle|Chelonii]]): 14 species recorded in total for the country (All 14 recorded for Trinidad, and possibly 6 recorded for Tobago. Four species are marine, with at least 4 being noted off Tobago, with at least 3 of those regularly breeding on both islands. Four are confirmed native terrestrial system species of Trinidad (1 of these is possibly a waif on Tobago). One is possibly a long introduced species on both islands that is still present in the wild in some areas of Trinidad, but unconfirmed in the wild in Tobago. One is very recently introduced in Trinidad from North America and it is unconfirmed if it is breeding in the wild. Three are possibly occasional waifs to Trinidad from the nearby continent with no verified local breeding populations).

Crocodiles and alligators ([[Crocodylia]]): 4 species recorded in total for the country (two are known to be native and breeding on Trinidad, with one of those breeding in Tobago, while the other 2 were occasionally historically recorded as waifs).

Legless lizards ([[Amphisbaenia]]): 2 species from Trinidad only.

Lizards ([[Sauria]]): 31 confirmed records for the country in total (2 of those not yet 'officially' documented). (Of the 31 confirmed records, 27 are from Trinidad, with at least 7 relatively recent historical introductions with 1 of these subsequently assumed to have been extirpated. Nineteen are from Tobago, with at least 3 relatively recent historical introductions there.  Four of those from Tobago are not found on Trinidad. In addition to the 31 confirmed records, there are at least 3 species records that are dubious). 

Snakes ([[Serpentes]]): 50 accepted records for the country in total (1 of these not yet 'officially' documented). (Of these 50 records, 45 are from Trinidad and 22 are from Tobago, with 5 of those from Tobago not being recorded from Trinidad. Of the 50 records for the country, 7 species are known from just 1 or 2 records. In addition to the 50 generally accepted confirmed records, there are at least 2 dubious records).

A number of frogs and toads inhabit the islands, including the well known huge marine or cane toad (''[[Rhinella marina]]'') locally known as the crapaud (pronounced crah-poh) on both islands, and the tiny colourful rare endemic species known as the El Tucuche golden tree frog (''[[Phytotriades auratus]]'') found only in the giant epiphitic bromeliads at the mist-shrouded summits of Trinidad's two highest peaks. The strangest of all Trinidad's frogs is the highly aquatic [[Suriname toad]] or pipa toad (''Pipa pipa''), the tadpoles of which develop in the skin tissue of the mother's back, before bursting out and emerging as miniature replicas of the adult frogs. The giant tree frog (''[[Hypsiboas boans]]'') known locally as the giant flying frog is commonly heard calling after dusk from the vegetation along forest-lined streams in Trinidad. The two frog species of the genus ''[[Mannophryne]]'' found diurnally active in forests along fast flowing mountain streams (one of which is endemic to Trinidad and the other endemic to Tobago) both demonstrate a degree of parental care as the tadpoles are transported on the backs of the adult males before a suitable fairly predator-free body of water is found where they may be left to develop. The relatively recently introduced Grenadian 'tink' frog (''[[Eleutherodactylus johnstonei]]'') can be heard at night in loud metallic 'tinking' choruses in urban residential neighbourhood yards and parks from Diego Martin to Sangre Grande in Trinidad, and more recently in southwestern Tobago. The tungara frog or locally called the ''pung-la-la'' (''[[Engystomops pustulosus]]'') is commonly heard at night calling from wet grassy ditches in open habitats in both urban and rural areas on both islands and their foam nests are found even in small road and trail side puddles during the rainy season. The southwestern peninsula of Trinidad is home to a rather diverse community of frogs, with at least one (''[[Leptodactylus nesiotus]]'') being known only from that area (an endemic). Trinidad may also be home to a caecilian (''[[Typhlonectes]]'' species) (a legless highly aquatic amphibian with an eel-like body that is rarely observed due to its habitat specifications) although only one specimen has ever been scientifically documented from Trinidad.

Terrapins, tortoises and marine turtles make their homes on and around these islands. The giant leatherback sea turtle (''[[Dermochelys coriacea]]''), the hawksbill turtle (''[[Eretmochelys imbricata]]''), the loggerhead turtle (''[[Caretta caretta]]''), the olive ridley turtle (''[[Lepidochelys olivacea]]'') and the green sea turtle (''[[Chelonia mydas]]'') are marine species that either nest on the islands' beaches or frequent their coastal waters.  The land dwelling yellow-footed tortoise (''[[Geochelone denticulata]]'') or Morrocoy as it is locally known is threatened by high levels of poaching in Trinidad. The odd mata-mata turtle (''[[Chelus fimbriata]]'') is known as a waif (and is possibly a rare inhabitant) of the [[Nariva Swamp]] and other southern and eastern coastal river systems in Trinidad. The wood-turtle locally known as the Galap (''[[Rhinoclemmys punctularia]]'') is found in and near rivers, streams and swamps in Trinidad, and has appeared on occasion as a waif on Tobago. 

All the marine turtle species are threatened by illegal hunting activity and as the bycatch of gillnet fishing. Never-the-less there has been great success achieved by measures taken to educate the public and ensure species conservation since the 1970s. Beaches on Trinidad's northern and eastern coasts are noted among the top 3 internationally most important nesting grounds for [[leatherback sea turtle]]s and a few community run conservation organizations help to maintain the nesting habitats, deter poaching and to bring sustainable revenue generated via ecotourism into their communities.

The spectacled caiman (''[[Caiman crocodilus]]'') which may grow up to a maximum of about {{convert|8|ft|m}} in length, but are usually somewhat smaller are to be found throughout both islands in slow moving freshwater (including reservoirs) or brackish water along the coasts. They are shy creatures and pose no real threat to humans unless intentionally provoked or approached while nesting. It is generally considered that the few records of both the American crocodile (''[[Crocodylus acutus]]'') as well as the Orinoco crocodile (''[[Crocodylus intermedius]]'') in the waters and on the coasts of Trinidad and Tobago were, for the most part, waifs from mainland South America.

There are two species of legless lizards ''[[Amphisbaena alba]]'' and ''[[Amphisbaena fuliginosa]]'' known as 'two headed' snakes on Trinidad. They spend much of their lives burrowing in the soil in forest or forest-edge areas and are often associated with the nests of leaf-cutter ants ''[[Atta (genus)|Atta]]'', which form part of their diet.

There are a number of lizards ranging in size from just over an inch or two in length to the huge {{convert|6|ft|m|sing=on}} long green iguana (''[[Iguana iguana]]''). The so-called luminous lizard (''[[Riama shrevei]]'') makes its home in primary lower montane and montane forest at the mouths of caves and cool stream banks on the high peaks, ridges and high valleys of the [[Northern Range]] of Trinidad and is found nowhere else on earth. Found in forest, forest edge and savanna habitats, the large tegu (''[[Tupinambis teguixin]]'') or matte/salipenta as it is locally called and the [[green iguana]] (still fairly common, even in some sub-urban areas) are considered delicacies on both Trinidad and Tobago. A number of [[anole]] species (''Anolis'') may be easily observed, even in suburban areas. Only ''[[Anolis chrysolepis]]'' is a Trinidad native, with all other anoles being relatively recently or historically introduced.  Other common lizards include macro-teiids (or whip-tailed lizards) such as the ''[[Ameiva atrigularis]]'' (locally called the zandolie or ground lizard and common even in suburban gardens) and ''[[Cnemidophorus lemniscatus]]'' (most readily seen along some coastal areas of southwestern Tobago and on Trinidad's east and south coasts and on the islands of [[Chacachacare]], [[Huevos]], [[Little Tobago]] and [[Goat Island (Trinidad and Tobago)|Goat Island]]). Nocturnally active geckos of the genera ''[[Thecadactylus]]'' and ''[[Hemidactylus]]'' are common in old and rural buildings on both islands and are commonly referred to as mabouias and wood slaves respectively. There are a number of small colourful diurnal geckos of the genus ''[[Gonatodes]]'' present. One of them, ''[[Gonatodes]] ocellatus'' is endemic to forests and edge habitats of northeastern Tobago while another, ''[[Gonatodes]] vittatus'' or the streak lizard as it is locally known, is very common and can be seen in most suburban and even urban backyards in Trinidad (and is probably relatively recently introduced to some parts Tobago associated with human occupation). The tiny Mole's gecko ''[[Sphaerodactylus]] molei'' is found on both islands and is among the smallest of lizards in the world.

Included among the country's snake fauna are some of the very smallest in the world (the [[fossorial]] [[thread snakes]] in the genus ''Epictia'' and other [[blind snakes]]), to the very largest of snakes in the world (the [[green anaconda]]). Anacondas (locally called the huille) have been historically found around streams, rivers and swamps in southern and eastern Trinidad, and recently also in the Caroni River drainage system. They have not been reported from Tobago. Three other boas, namely ''[[Boa constrictor]]'' (locally called the macajuel), ''[[Corallus ruschenbergerii]]'' (a tree boa locally called the cascabel dormilon) and ''[[Epicrates maurus]]'' (a rainbow boa) are found in forest and forest edge habitats throughout both islands (with the last even being common in some urban areas). Several harmless snakes in the subfamilies [[Colubrinae]] and [[Dipsadinae]] are found throughout the islands. Some of the larger examples of the diurnal Colubrinae include ''[[Spilotes pullatus]]'' (locally called the tigre in Trinidad and the black snake in Tobago) found in forest and forest edge habitats, and the rarer more forest dwelling ''[[Drymarchon corais]]'' (or yellow-tailed cribo) can be found on both islands. Smaller well known members of the subfamily include the machete couesse (''[[Mastigodryas boddaerti]]'' on Trinidad, and ''Mastigodryas dunni'' endemic to Tobago) and the horsewhip (''[[Oxybelis aeneus]]'') and are common in forest and forest edge habitats, even in some suburban areas of both islands. Among the Colubrinae, the loras ''[[Leptophis stimsoni]]'' and ''[[Leptophis]] haileyi'' are endemics to Trinidad's Northern Range and Tobago's Main Ridge respectively. Many of the members of the subfamily [[Dipsadinae]] are typically nocturnal and some of the more commonly observed species present even in suburban areas on both islands are the false mapipire (''[[Leptodeira annulata]] ashmeadi'') and the slug-eating snake (''[[Sibon nebulata]]''). Other interesting [[Dipsadinae]] include the water mapipire (''[[Helicops angulatus]]'') a habitat specialist of freshwater and brackish water systems of lowland Trinidad, the mainly diurnal beh belle chemin (''[[Erythrolamprus melanotus]] nesos'') of forest and edge habitats on both islands and the rare crepuscular red snake (''[[Erythrolamprus]] ocellatus'') endemic to the forest and edge habitats of northeastern Tobago. There are no dangerous venomous snakes on Tobago. There are only four dangerous venomous snakes on Trinidad. These include two vipers, and two coral snakes. The vipers (the true mapipires) are the mapipire balsain (''[[Bothrops]]'' cf. ''atrox'') and the mapipire zanana (''[[Lachesis muta]] muta''). The former is fairly common in primary and secondary forested areas of Trinidad (particularly so in the Northern Range), and the later is a very rarely encountered primary rainforest specialist in Trinidad. The two coral snakes are the small coral snake (''[[Micrurus circinalis]]'', and the large coral snake (''[[Micrurus lemniscatus]] diutius''), both associated with forested areas, and the later sometimes being associated with swampy habitats in Trinidad.

Fatal venomous snake bite accidents in Trinidad are fairly uncommon. It is unfortunate to note that although all snakes (with the exception of the potentially dangerous vipers and corals) are protected by law in Trinidad and Tobago, the human population at large is not generally tolerant of snakes, and even harmless snakes found near human dwellings, farms and gardens are often killed on sight. More public awareness is needed to dispel misconceptions about snakes as well as to sensitize the population to the ecological importance of snakes.

=== Invertebrates ===
{{seealso|List of butterflies of Tobago|List of non-marine molluscs of Trinidad and Tobago|List of scorpions of Trinidad and Tobago|List of opiliones of Trinidad and Tobago|List of mantids of Trinidad and Tobago}}
[[Image:Tropical butterfly.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Morpho peleides'' (morpho butterfly)]]
Trinidad and Tobago are extremely rich in neotropical invertebrate fauna. Several hundred species of butterflies, including the brilliant blue emperor butterfly (''[[Morpho peleides]]''), and beetles are to be found on the islands, many in the tropical forests. Barcant (1970) lists 617 species of butterfly for the two islands of which 123 occur on Tobago. The leaf cutter ant (''[[Atta (genus)|Atta]]'') is easily observed, even in sub-urban environments. Soldier ants may be observed in forested areas. The largest specimens of centipedes (genus ''[[Scolopendra]]'')(over {{convert|10|in|mm}} long) may be found particularly in the drier forests of the Northwestern Peninsular of Trinidad (the Chaguaramas Peninsular) as well as the nearby tiny off shore islands. A few species of large tarantulas may be found in forested areas and even in houses at the forest edge. The arthropod life of Trinidad and Tobago has not been well studied and it is an entomologist's paradise waiting to be discovered, with many species remaining undocumented.

There are approximately 70 species of land snails ranging in size from the giant South American land snail (''[[Megalobulimus oblongus]]'') to the tiny [[Gastrocopta]] snails.

Many species of crustaceans (terrestrial, freshwater and marine) are among the other invertebrates that may be easily observed in Trinidad and Tobago.

There are nine species of scorpions in Trinidad and Tobago including the medically important ''[[Tityus (genus)|Tityus]] trinitatis''.

== Aquatic communities ==

There are a number of wetland habitats on both Trinidad and Tobago that foster vital aquatic ecosystems.

The Bon Accord Lagoon on Tobago is a vital mangrove habitat and home to a population of spectacled caimans as well as a number of wetland bird species.

The Caroni Swamp on the west coast of Trinidad has a fairly high level of salinity (compared to other major wetlands on the island) and is an important breeding and feeding habitat for several bird species (including magnificent flocks of [[scarlet ibis]] (one of the National Birds)) and several marine fishes and invertebrates.

The Nariva Swamp of the east coast is the largest freshwater swamp on Trinidad and has a [[Ramsar Convention]] status of wetland of international importance. It and its associated river system of canals and rivers is home to a vast array of aquatic life, including a very small population of the highly endangered [[West Indian manatee]], the [[green anaconda]], the [[spectacled caiman]], the [[mata mata]] turtle and the [[common Suriname toad]]. The plant community in the swamp include various mangroves, [[moriche palm]]s and bloodwood trees.

There are many small rivers and streams throughout the islands. Over 40 species of freshwater fish have been recorded in Trinidad and Tobago. The world-famous [[guppy]] is a common native fish; particularly so in the mountain streams of Trinidad, where it has served as a model organism for several important ecological and evolutionary studies.

== Marine communities ==

Trinidad's western and southern coastal waters are highly influenced by the outflow of freshwater from the adjacent Orinoco River of Venezuela which is less than {{convert|8|mi|km}} away from Trinidad at the closest point. As such, the waters here are fairly low in salinity and high in sediment/nutrient content and relatively shallow. These facts coupled with the highly sheltered nature of the Gulf of Paria and the Columbus Channel respectively, create ideal breeding/spawning grounds for many marine fishes and invertebrates, including shrimp.

Various 'sporting' fish are present in the waters of both islands and include huge grouper, marlin, barracuda and dolphin-fish. Fish popularly caught and eaten include carite, kingfish and red snapper.

As mentioned in the section above on the reptilian fauna of Trinidad and Tobago, a number of species of marine turtles including the leatherback turtle, hawksbill turtle, loggerhead turtle, olive ridley turtle and green sea turtle frequent the waters around and/or nest on some of the beaches of both islands.

Whales and dolphins were far more common to Trinidad and Tobago's waters in earlier times, but the very rigorous whaling industry of the 19th century decimated the population of whales in the Gulf of Paria (called 'Golfo de Balena' or Gulf of Whales by Christopher Columbus). Today, dolphins may still be regularly observed, particularly off the shore of the northwestern [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]] peninsula. Pilot whales have been observed to beach themselves on a few occasions during the 1990s and a small pod of killer whales were caught in a fisherman's net during the 1980s. ''See also: [[List of mammals of Trinidad and Tobago]]''

Whale sharks (the largest of all fishes) have been observed around the oil rigs in the southern part of the Gulf of Paria. Hammerhead sharks are commonly caught by fishermen and shark flesh is unfortunately considered a delicacy among the human population of both islands.

The waters of Tobago are less affected by the outflow of fresh water from the Orinoco and as such are far more saline and clearer than that of Trinidad. A number of coral reefs are thus able to exist around Tobago, the most famous being the Buccoo Reef. Tobago's reefs are reputedly home to the largest examples of brain coral. Also present are huge and gentle manta rays, impressive moray eels, parrot fish, angel fish and a host of other colourful tropical coral reef species.

'''Nature-based solutions''' ('''NBS''' or '''NbS''') refers to the [[sustainable management]] and use of nature for tackling socio-environmental challenges. The challenges include issues such as [[climate change]], [[water security]], [[water pollution]], [[food security]], [[human health]], and [[disaster]] [[risk]] management. 

A definition by the [[European Union]] states that these solutions are "inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build [[Resilience (engineering and construction)|resilience]]. The [http://www.naturebasedsolutionsinitiative.org/about/ Nature-based Solutions Initiative] meanwhile defines them as "actions that work with and enhance nature so as to help people adapt to change and disasters". Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.think-nature.eu/|title=thinknature|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With NBS, healthy, resilient and diverse [[ecosystems]] (whether natural, managed or newly created) can provide solutions for the benefit of societies and overall [[biodiversity]].

For instance, the restoration or protection of [[mangroves]] along coastlines utilizes a nature-based solution to accomplish several things. Mangroves moderate the impact of waves and wind on coastal settlements or cities and sequester CO&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt; . They also provide safe nurseries for marine life that can be the basis for sustaining populations of fish that local populations may depend on. Additionally, the mangrove forests can help control coastal erosion resulting from sea level rise. Similarly, in cities [[green roofs]] or walls are nature-based solutions that can be used to moderate the impact of high temperatures, capture storm water, abate [[pollution]], and act as carbon sinks, while enhancing [[biodiversity]].

Conservation approaches and environment management initiatives have been carried out for decades. What is new is that the benefits of such nature-based solutions to human well-being have been articulated well more recently. Even if the term itself is still being framed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-12|title=‘Nature-based solutions’ is the latest green jargon that means more than you might think|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/541133b|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=541|issue=7636|pages=133–134|doi=10.1038/541133b|bibcode=2017Natur.541R.133.}}&lt;/ref&gt; examples of nature-based solutions can be found all over the world, and imitated. Nature-based solutions are on their way to being mainstreamed in national and international policies and programmes (e.g. climate change policy, law, infrastructure investment and financing mechanisms).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} For example, the theme for [[World Water Day]] 2018 was "Nature for water" and by [[UN-Water]]'s accompanying [[UN World Water Development Report]] had the title "Nature-based Solutions for Water".&lt;ref&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018: Nature-based Solutions for Water], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

Societies increasingly face challenges such as [[climate change]], [[urbanization]], jeopardized [[food security]] and [[water resource]] provision, and [[disaster]] [[risk]]. One approach to answer these challenges is to singularly rely on technological strategies. An alternative approach is to manage the [[Socio-ecological system|(socio-)ecological systems]] in a comprehensive way in order to sustain and potentially increase the delivery of ecosystem services to humans. In this context, nature-based solutions (NBS) have recently been put forward by practitioners and quickly thereafter by [[policymakers]]. These solutions stress the sustainable use of nature in solving coupled environmental-social-economic challenges. 

While [[ecosystem services]] are often valued in terms of immediate benefits to human well-being and economy, NBS focus on the benefits to people and the environment itself, to allow for sustainable solutions that are able to respond to environmental change and [[hazard]]s in the long-term. NBS go beyond the traditional biodiversity conservation and management principles by "re-focusing" the debate on humans and specifically integrating societal factors such as human well-being and [[poverty reduction]], [[Socioeconomic development|socio-economic development]], and [[governance]] principles. 

With respect to water issues, NBS can achieve the following, according to the [[World Water Development Report]] 2018 by [[UN-Water]]:&lt;ref&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Use natural processes to enhance water availability (e.g., [[soil]] moisture retention, [[groundwater recharge]]),  
* Improve [[water quality]] (e.g., [[Wetland|natural wetlands]] and [[constructed wetlands]] to treat [[wastewater]], [[riparian buffer]] strips), and  
* Reduce risks associated with water‐related disasters and climate change (e.g., [[floodplain restoration]], [[green roofs]]).

These organisations refer to "policies and measures that take into account the role of ecosystem services in reducing the vulnerability of society to climate change, in a multi-sectoral and multi-scale approach".&lt;ref name="Cowan3" /&gt;

Similarly, the concept of [[ecological engineering]] generally refers to "protecting, restoring (i.e. ecosystem restoration) or modifying ecological systems to increase the quantity, quality and sustainability of particular services they provide, or to build new ecological systems that provide services that would otherwise be provided through more conventional engineering, based on non-renewable resources".&lt;ref name="Borsje8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barot9" /&gt;

== Objectives and framing ==

The general objective of NBS is clear, namely the sustainable management and use of nature for tackling societal challenges.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2016. Resolution 077 World Conservation Congress 2016, Hawai’i (https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/077)
17. European Commission. 2016. Horizon2020 Work Programme 2016–2017 – 12. Climate action, environment, resource efficiency &amp; raw materials, 99 pp. (http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-climate_en.pdf)
&lt;/ref&gt; However, different stakeholders view NBS from other perspectives.&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"&gt;Eggermont, H., E. Balian, J. M.N. Azevedo, V. Beumer, T. Brodin, J. Claudet, B. Fady, M. Grube, H. Keune, P. Lamarque, K. Reuter, M. Smitt, C. Van Ham, W.W. Weisser, X. Le Roux. 2015. Nature-based solutions: New influence for Environmental Management and Research in Europe. GAIA Ecological Perspectives 24/4: 243–248.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[IUCN]]&lt;ref name="IUCN16"&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2016. Resolution 077 World Conservation Congress 2016, Hawai’i (https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/077)&lt;/ref&gt; defines NBS as "actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems, which address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits". This framing puts the need for well-managed and restored ecosystems at the heart of NBS, with the overarching goal of "Supporting the achievement of society's development goals and safeguard human well-being in ways that reflect cultural and societal values and enhance the resilience of ecosystems, their capacity for renewal and the provision of services". 

In the context of the ongoing political debate on jobs and growth (main drivers of the current EU policy agenda), the European Commission underlines that NBS can transform environmental and societal challenges into innovation opportunities, by turning [[natural capital]] into a source for green growth and sustainable development.&lt;ref name="European Commission 2015" /&gt; In their view, NBS to societal challenges are "solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;European Commission. 2016. Horizon2020 Work Programme 2016–2017 – 12. Climate action, environment, resource efficiency &amp; raw materials, 99 pp. (http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-climate_en.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;" 

This framing is somewhat broader, and puts economy and social assets at the heart of NBS as importantly as sustaining environmental conditions. It shares similarities with the definition proposed by Maes and Jacobs (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Maes, J., S. Jacobs. 2015. Conservation Letters {{doi|10.1111/conl.12216}}&lt;/ref&gt; defining NBS as "any transition to a use of ES with decreased input of non-renewable natural capital and increased investment in renewable natural processes". In their view, development and evaluation of NBS spans three basic requirements: (1) decrease of fossil fuel input per produced unit; (2) lowering of systemic trade-offs and increasing synergies between ES; and (3) increasing labor input and jobs. Here, nature is seen as a tool to inspire more systemic solutions to societal problems.

Whatever definition used, promoting sustainability and the increased role of natural, self-sustained processes relying on [[biodiversity]], are inherent to NBS. They constitute actions easily seen as positive for a wide range of stakeholders, as they bring about benefits at environmental, economic and social levels. As a consequence, the concept of NBS is gaining acceptance outside the conservation community (e.g. urban planning) and is now on its way to be mainstreamed into policies and programmes (climate change policy, law, infrastructure investment and financing mechanisms).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Types ==

[[File:Fig 2 NbS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.46|Schematic presentation of the NBS typology.&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"/&gt;]]

In 2015,&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"/&gt; the European network [http://www.biodiversa.org BiodivERsA] mobilized a range of scientists, research donors and stakeholders and proposed a typology characterizing NBS along two gradients. 1. "how much engineering of biodiversity and ecosystems is involved in NBS", and 2. "how many ecosystem services and stakeholder groups are targeted by a given NBS". The typology highlights that NBS can involve very different actions on ecosystems (from protection to management and even creation of new ecosystems) and is based on the assumption that the higher the number of services and stakeholder groups targeted, the lower the capacity to maximize the delivery of each service and simultaneously fulfil the specific needs of all stakeholder groups. As such, three types of NBS are distinguished (Figure 2):

=== Type 1 – Minimal intervention in ecosystems ===
Type 1 NBS consists of no or minimal intervention in ecosystems, with the objectives of maintaining or improving the delivery of a range of ES both inside and outside of these conserved ecosystems. Examples include the protection of mangroves in coastal areas to limit risks associated to extreme weather conditions and provide benefits and opportunities to local populations; and the establishment of marine protected areas to conserve biodiversity within these areas while exporting biomass into fishing grounds. This type of NBS is connected to, for example, the concept of [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|biosphere reserves]] which incorporates core protected areas for nature conservation and buffer zones and transition areas where people live and work in a sustainable way.

=== Type 2 – Some interventions in ecosystems and landscapes ===
Type 2 NBS corresponds to management approaches that develop sustainable and multifunctional ecosystems and landscapes (extensively or intensively managed). These types improve the delivery of selected ES compared to what would be obtained with a more conventional intervention. Examples include innovative planning of agricultural landscapes to increase their multi-functionality; and approaches for enhancing tree species and genetic diversity to increase forest resilience to extreme events. This type of NBS is strongly connected to concepts like natural systems agriculture,&lt;ref name="Jackson1" /&gt; agro-ecology,&lt;ref&gt;Alteri, M.A. 1989. Agroecology – a new research and development paradigm for world agriculture. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment 27: 37–36.&lt;/ref&gt; and evolutionary-orientated forestry.&lt;ref&gt;Lefèvre F. et al. 2014. Considering evolutionary processes in adaptive forestry. Annals of Forest Science 71: 723 – 739.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Type 3 – Managing ecosystems in extensive ways ===
Type 3 NBS consists of managing ecosystems in very extensive ways or even creating new ecosystems (e.g., artificial ecosystems with new assemblages of organisms for green roofs and walls to mitigate city warming and clean polluted air). Type 3 is linked to concepts like green and blue infrastructures and objectives like restoration of heavily degraded or polluted areas and greening cities.

Type 1 and 2 would typically fall within the IUCN NBS framework, whereas Type 2 and moreover Type 3 are often exemplified by EC for turning natural capital into a source for green growth and sustainable development.

=== Hybrid solutions ===
Hybrid solutions exist along this gradient both in space and time. For instance, at landscape scale, mixing protected and managed areas could be needed to fulfil multi-functionality and sustainability goals. Similarly, a [[constructed wetland]] can be developed as a type 3 but, when well established, may subsequently be preserved and surveyed as a type 1.

== Examples ==

Demonstrating the benefits of nature and healthy ecosystems and showcasing the return on investment they can offer is necessary in order to increase awareness, but also to provide support and guidance on how to implement NBS. A large number of initiatives around the world already highlight the effectiveness of NBS approaches to address a wide range of societal challenges.

==== East Kolkata wetlands ====
In 2018, [[The Hindu]] reported that the [[East Kolkata wetlands]], the world's largest organic sewage treatment facility had been used to clean the sewage of Kolkata in an organic manner by using algae for several decades. In use since the 1930s, the natural system was discovered by Dhrubajyoti Ghosh, an ecologist and a municipal engineer in the 1970s while working in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/wetlands-will-weep-today-1502586927.html|title=The wetlands will weep today|last1=Ghatak|first1=Aditi Roy|date=17 February 2018|accessdate=8 March 2018|publisher=The Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghosh worked for decades to protect the wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhrubajyoti.net/publ/Dr.%20Ghosh_changemaker.pdf|title=The Calcutta Wetlands: turning bad water into good|last1=Ghosh|first1=Dhrubajyoti|website=www.dhrubajyoti.net|publisher=Changemakers (issue October 2008)|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been a practice in [[Kolkata]], one of the five largest cities in [[India]], for the municipal authorities to pump sewage into shallow ponds (''bheris'').&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dhrubajyoti.net/Final%20Ecosystem%20Book.pdf|title=Ecosystem management – towards merging theory and practice|last1=Ghosh|first1=Dhrubajyoti|date=2 October 2014|publisher=Nimby books|isbn=9788190657044|location=New delhi|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the heat of the tropical sun, algae proliferated in them, converting the sewage into clean water, which in turn was used by villagers to grow paddy and vegetables. This system has been in use in the region since the 1930s and treats 750 million litres of [[wastewater]] per day, giving livelihood to 100,000 people in the vicinity.&lt;ref name="kol"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aseem|first1=Shrivastava|title=The ecologically subsidised city: on Kolkata's wetland communities|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-ecologically-subsidised-city/article22970933.ece|accessdate=8 March 2018|publisher=The Hindu|date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For his work, Ghosh was included in the UN Global 500 Roll of Honour in 1990 and received the [[Luc Hoffmann]] award in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global500.org/index.php/year/1990?start=100|title=Global 500 environmental forum|website=www.global500.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical implementation ==
{{refimprove|section|date=March 2018}}
There is currently no accepted basis on which a government agency, municipality or private company can systematically assess the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of a particular nature-based solution. However, a series of principles are proposed to guide effective and appropriate implementation, and thus to upscale NBS in practice. For example, NBS embrace and are not meant to replace nature conservation norms. Also, NBS are determined by site-specific natural and cultural contexts that include traditional, local and scientific knowledge. NBS are an integral part of the overall design of policies, and measure or actions, to address a specific challenges. Finally, NBS can be implemented alone or in an integrated manner with other solutions to societal challenges (e.g. technological and engineering solutions) and they are applied at the landscape scale.

Implementing NBS requires political, economic, and scientific challenges to be tackled. First and foremost, private sector investment is needed, not to replace but to supplement traditional sources of capital such as public funding or [[philanthropy]]. The challenge is therefore to provide a robust evidence base for the contribution of nature to economic growth and jobs, and to demonstrate the economic viability of these solutions – compared to technological ones – on a timescale compatible with that of global change. Furthermore, it requires measures like adaptation of economic subsidy schemes, and the creation of opportunities for [[conservation finance]], to name a few. Indeed, such measures will be needed to scale up NBS interventions, and strengthen their impact in mitigating the world's most pressing challenges.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Projects supported by the European Union ===
Since 2016, the EU is supporting a multi-stakeholder dialogue platform (called ThinkNature) to promote the co-design, testing and deployment of improved and innovative NBS in an integrated way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Creation of such science-policy-business-society interfaces could promote the market uptake of NBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolaidis|first=Nikolaos P.|last2=Kolokotsa|first2=Dionyssia|last3=Banwart|first3=Steven A.|date=2017-03-16|title=Nature-based solutions: business|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7645/full/543315d.html?foxtrotcallback=true|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=543|issue=7645|pages=315–315|doi=10.1038/543315d|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2017Natur.543..315N}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is part of the EU’s Horizon 2020 – Research and Innovation programme, and will last for 3 years. There are a total of 17 international partners involved, including the Technical University of Crete (Project Leader), the University of Helsinki and BiodivERsA.

In 2017, as part of the Presidency of the [[Estonia|Estonian Republic]] of the [[Council of the European Union]], a conference called “Nature-based Solutions: From Innovation to Common-use” was organized by the Ministry of the Environment of Estonia and the University of Tallinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nbs2017.eu/|title=Nature-Based Solutions, Tallinn, 24–26 October 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conference aimed to strengthen synergies among various recent initiatives and programs related to NBS launched by the European Commission and by the EU Member States, focusing on policy and governance of NBS, and on research and innovation.

=== Nature-based Solutions in the Paris Agreement ===
In recognition of the importance of natural ecosystems for mitigation and adaptation, the [http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf Paris Agreement] calls on all Parties to acknowledge “the importance of the conservation and enhancement, as appropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of the greenhouse gases” and to “note the importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including oceans, and the protection of biodiversity, recognized by some cultures as Mother Earth”. It then includes in its Articles several references to nature-based solutions. For example, Article 5.2 encourages Parties to adopt “…policy approaches and positive incentives for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the role of conservation and sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries; and alternative policy approaches, such as joint mitigation and adaptation approaches for the integral and sustainable management of forests, while reaffirming the importance of incentivizing, as appropriate, non-carbon benefits associated with such approaches”. Article 7.1 further encourages Parties to build the resilience of socioeconomic and ecological systems, including through economic diversification and sustainable management of natural resources. In total, the Agreement refers to nature (ecosystems, natural resources, forests) in 13 distinct places. An in-depth analysis &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbspolicyplatform.org/|title=Nature-Based Solutions Policy Platform|website=www.nbspolicyplatform.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; of all Nationally Determined Contributions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/process/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions/ndc-registry|title=Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) {{!}} UNFCCC|website=unfccc.int|language=en|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; submitted to UNFCCC, revealed that around 130 NDCs or 65% of signatories commit to nature-based solutions in their climate pledges, suggesting broad consensus for the role of nature in helping meet climate change goals. However, high-level commitments rarely translate into robust, measurable actions on-the-ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=July 2016|title=Ecosystem-based adaptation: a win–win formula for sustainability in a warming world?|url=http://pubs.iied.org/17364IIED/?k=Ecosystem-based+Adaptation+EbA&amp;p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The term NBS was put forward by practitioners in the late 2000s (in particular the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] and the [[World Bank]]) and thereafter by policymakers in Europe (most notably the [[European Commission]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faivre|first=Nicolas|last2=Fritz|first2=Marco|last3=Freitas|first3=Tiago|last4=Boissezon|first4=Birgit de|last5=Vandewoestijne|first5=Sofie|title=Nature-Based Solutions in the EU: Innovating with nature to address social, economic and environmental challenges|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.032|journal=Environmental Research|volume=159|pages=509–518|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.032|bibcode=2017ER....159..509F}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "nature-based solutions" was first used in the late 2000s.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon11"&gt;MacKinnon, K., C. Sobrevila, V. Hickey. 2008. Biodiversity, climate change and adaptation: nature-based solutions from the Word Bank portfolio. Washington D.C.: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittermeier12"&gt;Mittermeier, R. et al. 2008. A Climate For Life: Meeting the Global Challenge. Arlington, VA: International League of Conservation Photographers.&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in the context of finding new solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change effects, whilst simultaneously protecting biodiversity and improving sustainable livelihoods. 

The IUCN referred to NBS in a position paper for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2009. No time to lose – make full use of nature-based solutions in the post-2012 climate change regime. Position paper on the Fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 15). Gland: IUCN.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also adopted by European policymakers, in particular by the European Commission in a report&lt;ref name="European Commission 2015"&gt;European Commission. 2015. Towards an EU Research and Innovation policy agenda for nature-based solutions &amp; re-naturing cities. Final Report of the Horizon2020 Expert Group on Nature-Based Solutions and Re-Naturing Cities. Brussels: European Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; stressing that NBS can offer innovative means to create jobs and growth as part of a green economy. The term started to make appearances in the mainstream media around the time of the Global Climate Action Summit in California in September 2018 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nathalieseddon.blogspot.com/2018/09/global-climate-action-summit-kicks-off.html|title=Global Climate Action Summit kicks off today in San Francisco with nature-based solutions high on the agenda|website=Global Climate Action Summit kicks off today in San Francisco with nature-based solutions high on the agenda|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OSCAR IV''' ({{aka}} OSCAR 4) is the fourth [[amateur radio satellite]] launched by Project [[OSCAR]] and the first targeted for [[Geostationary orbit]] on 12 December 1965.  The satellite was launched piggyback with three United States Air Force satellites on a [[Titan IIIC]] launch vehicle.  The satellite was [[regular tetrahedron]], 48&amp;nbsp;cm on each side. It had four independent monopole antennas and like [[OSCAR 3]] contained a tracking beacon transmitter and a communications repeater. It was powered by a solar cell array and batteries.

The launch vehicle suffered a partial failure and placed OSCAR IV in an unplanned 161&amp;nbsp;km × 33000-km orbit preventing the planned coverage. OSCAR IV was built by the TRW Radio Club of Redondo Beach, California. It had a 3 Watt 10&amp;nbsp;kHz wide linear transponder (144&amp;nbsp;MHz uplink and 432&amp;nbsp;MHz downlink).  The satellite remained in operation for 85 days, until March 16, 1966.
The satellite eventually re-entered Earth's atmosphere on April 12, 1976. Only 12 two-way communications were established through the linear transponder, but one on December 22, 1965 was the first direct satellite communication between the United States and the USSR.&lt;ref name="NASA Oscar 4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1965-016F |title=Oscar 4 |publisher=NASA National Space Science Data Center |date=30 June 1977 |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/oscar-4.htm |title=OSCAR 4|publisher=Gunter's Space Page |date=31 December 1999 |accessdate=15 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project OSCAR==
Project OSCAR Inc. started in 1960 with the TRW Radio Club of Redondo Beach, California and radio amateurs who worked at TRW and other California defense companies, to investigate the possibility of putting an amateur satellite in orbit.  Project OSCAR was responsible for the construction of the first Amateur Radio Satellite OSCAR-1, that was successfully launched from Vandenberg AFB in California . [[OSCAR 1]] orbited the earth for 22 days, transmitting the “HI” greeting you see in Morse Code above.
&lt;br&gt;Project OSCAR was responsible for launching of 3 other amateur radio satellites during the 1960s: [[OSCAR 1]], [[OSCAR 2]], and [[OSCAR 3]].

In 1969, AMSAT-NA was founded by radio amateurs working at NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] and the Baltimore-Washington DC region, to continue the efforts begun by [[OSCAR|Project OSCAR]].
&lt;br&gt;Its first project was to coordinate the launch of [[Australis-OSCAR 5]], constructed by students at the [[University of Melbourne]].&lt;ref name="HIST"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/AboutAmsat/amsat_history.php | title=Space Satellites from the World's Garage – The Story of AMSAT | publisher=AMSAT-NA | accessdate=14 February 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005160332/http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/AboutAmsat/amsat_history.php | archivedate=5 October 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, over fifty years later, Project OSCAR still exists as part of the San Jose (CA) Amateur Radio Club.  Its mission is “To initiate and support activities that promote the Satellite Amateur Radio Hobby”. The primary goal is to reach out and provide logistical support, training and in some cases equipment to amateur radio associations, schools and the public at large.

==Firsts==
Oscar IV was the first attempt for a High Earth Orbit (HEO) or GeoStationary Earth Orbit (GEO) amateur radio satellite, later categorized by AMSAT as Phase 3 and Phase 4.

Improvements included:
* First higher power (3 Watt) 10&amp;nbsp;kHz wide linear transponder (144&amp;nbsp;MHz uplink and 432&amp;nbsp;MHz downlink), due to higher planned orbit.
* First direct satellite communication between the United States and the USSR.
* Successful development of innovative workaround procedures for satellite usage, based on launch vehicle partial failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/AboutAmsat/amsat_history.php |title=Space Satellites from the World's Garage -- The Story of AMSAT |last1=Baker |first1=Keith |last2=Jansson |first2=Dick |date=23 May 1994 |accessdate=15 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005160332/http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/AboutAmsat/amsat_history.php |archivedate=5 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5140">A '''Pickering emulsion''' is an [[emulsion]] that is stabilized by solid particles (for example [[colloidal]] [[silica]]) which adsorb onto the [[interface (chemistry)|interface]] between the two [[phase (matter)|phase]]s.  This type of [[emulsion]] was named after [[Percival Spencer Umfreville Pickering|S.U. Pickering]], who described the phenomenon in 1907, although the effect was first recognized by Walter Ramsden in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1039/CT9079102001| title=Emulsions | volume=91 | journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions | pages=2001-2021| year=1907 | last1=Pickering | first1=Spencer Umfreville }} S.U. Pickering, J. Chem. Soc. 91 (1907) 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1098/rspl.1903.0034 | title=Separation of Solids in the Surface-layers of Solutions and 'Suspensions' | volume=72 | issue=477–486 | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London | pages=156–164| year=1903 | last1=Ramsden | first1=W }} W. Ramsden, Proc. R. Soc. London 72 (1903) 156&lt;/ref&gt;

If oil and water are mixed and small oil droplets are formed and dispersed throughout the water, eventually the droplets will coalesce to decrease the amount of energy in the system.  However, if solid particles are added to the mixture, they will bind to the surface of the interface and prevent the droplets from coalescing, making the emulsion more stable.

Properties such as [[hydrophobicity]], shape, and size of the particle can have an effect on the stability of the emulsion.  The particle’s [[contact angle]] to the surface of the droplet is a characteristic of the hydrophobicity.  If the contact angle of the particle to the interface is low, the particle will be mostly [[wetted]] by the droplet and therefore will not be likely to prevent coalescence of the droplets.  Particles that are partially hydrophobic (i.e. contact angle of approximately 90°) are better stabilizers because they are partially wettable by both liquids and therefore bind better to the surface of the droplets. The stabilization energy is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E\ = \pi r^2\gamma_{OW}(1-|cos{\theta_{OW}}|)^2&lt;/math&gt;
where r is the particle radius, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{OW}&lt;/math&gt; is the interfacial tension, and &lt;math&gt;\theta_{OW}&lt;/math&gt; is the contact angle. 

When the contact angle is approximately 90°, the energy required to stabilize the system is at its minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Velikov|first1=Krassimir P.|title=Colloid Stability|last2=Velev|first2=Orlin D.|year=2014|pages=277–306|doi=10.1002/9783527631193.ch35|isbn=9783527631193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Generally, the phase that preferentially wets the particle will be the continuous phase in the emulsion system.

Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the stability of the Pickering emulsions can be improved by the use of amphiphilic  "[[Janus particles]]", namely particles that have one hydrophobic and one hydrophilic side, due to the higher adsorption energy of the particles at the liquid-liquid interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Binks|first1=B. P.|last2=Fletcher|first2=P. D. I.|title=Particles Adsorbed at the Oil−Water Interface:  A Theoretical Comparison between Spheres of Uniform Wettability and "Janus" Particles|journal=Langmuir|volume=17|issue=16|year=2001|pages=4708–4710|issn=0743-7463|doi=10.1021/la0103315}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident when observing [[Emulsion Stabilization Using Polyelectrolytes|emulsion stabilization using polyelectrolytes]].

Homogenised milk is an example of a Pickering-stabilized emulsion. Casein (protein) units are adsorbed at the surface of milk fat globules and act as a surfactant. The casein replaces the milkfat globule membrane, which is damaged during homogenisation.

It is possible to use latex particles for Pickering stabilization and then fuse these particles to form a permeable shell or capsule, called a colloidosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dinsmore|first1=A. D.|title=Colloidosomes: Selectively Permeable Capsules Composed of Colloidal Particles|journal=Science|volume=298|issue=5595|year=2002|pages=1006–1009|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.1074868|pmid=12411700|bibcode=2002Sci...298.1006D|citeseerx=10.1.1.476.7703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Pickering emulsion droplets are also suitable templates for [[micro-encapsulation]] and the formation of closed, non-permeable capsules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.slideshare.net/jorissalari/joris-salari-phd|title=Pickering emulsions, colloidosomes &amp;micro-encapsulation|publisher=Slideshare|author=Joris Salari|date=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of encapsulation can also be applied to water-in-water emulsions (dispersions of phase-separated aqueous polymer solutions), and can also be reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poortinga|first1=Albert T.|title=Microcapsules from Self-Assembled Colloidal Particles Using Aqueous Phase-Separated Polymer Solutions|journal=Langmuir|volume=24|issue=5|year=2008|pages=1644–1647|issn=0743-7463|doi=10.1021/la703441e|pmid=18220438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These complementary pits are called "pit pairs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Introduction to Plant Cell Development |author= Jeremy Burgess |edition= |publisher= CUP Archive |year= 1985 |isbn= 9780521316118 |page= 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pits are composed of three parts: the pit chamber, the pit aperture, and the pit membrane. The pit chamber is the hollow area where the secondary layers of the cell wall are absent. The pit aperture is the opening at either end of the pit chamber. The pit membrane is the primary cell wall and [[middle lamella]], or the membrane between adjacent cell walls, at the middle of the pit chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Esau's Plant Anatomy: Meristems, Cells, and Tissues of the Plant Body: Their Structure, Function, and Development |author= Ray F. Evert |edition= third, illustrated |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |year= 2006 |isbn= 9780470047378 |page= 76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary cell wall at the pit membrane may also have depressions similar to the pit depressions of the secondary layers. These depressions are primary pit-fields, or primary pits. In the primary pit, the primordial pit provides an interruption in the primary cell wall that the [[plasmodesmata]] can cross. The primordial pit is the only aperture in the otherwise continuous primary cell wall.&lt;ref name=PlantAnat&gt;{{cite book |title=Anatomy of Seed Plants |series=Plant Anatomy |edition=2nd |author=Katherine Easu |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=51 |year= 1977 |isbn=0-471-24520-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pit pairs are a characteristic feature of the [[xylem]], as [[sap]] flows through the pits of xylem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Three-dimensional Structure of Wood: A Scanning Electron Microscope Study; Volume 2 of Syracuse wood science series |author= B. A. Meylan, Brian Geoffrey Butterfield |edition= illustrated |publisher= Syracuse University Press |year= 1972 |isbn= 9780815650300 |page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of pits==
[[File:Simple Pit Pair.jpg|thumb|A simplified diagram of a simple pit pair]]

Though pits are usually simple and complementary, a few more pit variations can be formed:

*Simple pits: A pit pair in which the diameter of the pit chamber and the diameter of the pit aperture are equal.

*Bordered pits: A pit pair in which the pit chamber is over-arched by the cell wall, creating a larger pit chamber and smaller pit aperture.

*Half bordered pits: A pit pair in which a bordered pit has a complementary simple pit. Such a pit pair is called half bordered pit pair.

*Blind pits: A pit pair in which a simple pit has no complementary pit.

*Compound pits: A pit pair in which one cell wall has a large pit and the adjacent cell wall has numerous, small pits.

==Plasmodesmata==
{{Main|Plasmodesma}}

Plasmodesmata are thin sections of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] that traverse pits and connect adjacent cells. These sections provide an avenue of transport through the pits and facilitate communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= An Introduction to Plant Structure and Development: Plant Anatomy for the Twenty-First Century |author= Charles B. Beck |edition= second, revised |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2010 |isbn= 9781139486361 |page= 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasmodesmata are not restricted to pits however, as plasmodesmata often cross a cell wall of constant width and occasionally the cell wall is even wider in areas where plasmodesmata traverse it.&lt;ref name=PlantAnat/&gt;

==Torus and margo==
[[File:Torus and Margo.png|thumb|A simplified diagram of a bordered pit-pair with a torus and margo. The top shows an unobstructed pit and the bottom shows an aspirated pit, with the margo flexing under stress.]]
The torus and margo are characteristic features of bordered pit-pairs in [[gymnosperms]], such as [[Coniferales]], ''[[Ginkgo]]'', and ''[[Gnetales]]''. In other [[vascular plants]], the torus is rare. The pit membrane is separated into two parts: a thick impermeable torus at the center of the pit membrane, and the permeable margo surrounding it. The torus regulates the functions of the bordered pit, and the margo is a cell wall-derived porous membrane that supports the torus. The margo is composed of bundles of [[microfibril]]s that radiate from the torus.&lt;ref name=PlantAnat/&gt;

The margo is flexible and can move towards either side of the pit while under stress. This allows the thick, impermeable torus to block the pit aperture. When the torus is displaced so that it blocks the pit aperture, the pit is said to be aspirated.

{{Geological eon}}
	
The '''Proterozoic''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˌ|p|r|oʊ|t|ər|ə|ˈ|z|oʊ|ɪ|k|,_|p|r|ɔː|-|,_|-|t|r|ə|-}}{{refn|{{cite web |url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Proterozoic |title=Proterozoic – definition of Proterozoic in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |access-date=2016-01-20 }}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Proterozoic}}}}) is a [[eon (geology)|geological eon]] spanning the time from the appearance of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere to just before the proliferation of complex [[life]] (such as [[Trilobite|trilobites]] or [[Coral|corals]]) on the Earth. The name Proterozoic combines the two forms of ultimately Greek origin: ''protero-'' meaning "former, earlier", and ''-zoic'', a suffix related to ''zoe'' "life". The Proterozoic Eon extended from 2500 mya to 541 mya (million years ago), and is the most recent part of the [[Precambrian]] "supereon". The Proterozoic is the longest eon of the Earth's [[geologic time scale]] and it is subdivided into three geologic [[era (geology)|era]]s (from oldest to youngest): the [[Paleoproterozoic]], [[Mesoproterozoic]], and [[Neoproterozoic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Speer|first1=Brian|title=The Proterozoic Eon|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/precambrian/proterozoic.php|website=University of California Museum of Paleontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The well-identified events of this eon were the [[Great Oxygenation Event|transition to an oxygenated atmosphere]] during the [[Paleoproterozoic]]; several [[glacier|glaciations]], which produced the hypothesized [[Snowball Earth]] during the [[Cryogenian]] Period in the late [[Neoproterozoic]] Era; and the [[Ediacaran]] Period (635 to 541 Ma) which is characterized by the evolution of abundant soft-bodied [[multicellular organism]]s and provides us with the first obvious fossil evidence of life on earth.

==The Proterozoic record==
{{Life timeline}}
The geologic record of the Proterozoic Eon is more complete than that for the preceding [[Archean]] Eon. In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean, the Proterozoic features many [[stratum|strata]] that were laid down in extensive shallow [[Epeiric Sea|epicontinental seas]]; furthermore, many of those rocks are less [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] than are Archean ones, and many are unaltered.&lt;ref name=Stanley&gt;{{cite book| last=Stanley| first=Steven M.| title=Earth System History| location=New York| publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company| year=1999| isbn=0-7167-2882-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|315}} Studies of these rocks have shown that the eon continued the massive [[continent]]al accretion that had begun late in the Archean Eon. The Proterozoic Eon also featured the first definitive [[supercontinent cycle]]s and wholly modern mountain building activity ([[orogeny]]).&lt;ref name=Stanley/&gt;{{rp|315–18, 329–32}}

There is evidence that the first known glaciations occurred during the Proterozoic. The first began shortly after the beginning of the Proterozoic Eon, and evidence of at least four during the Neoproterozoic Era at the end of the Proterozoic Eon, possibly climaxing with the hypothesized [[Snowball Earth]] of the [[Sturtian]] and [[Marinoan]] glaciations.&lt;ref name=Stanley/&gt;{{rp|320–1, 325}}

==The accumulation of oxygen==
One of the most important events of the Proterozoic was the [[oxygen catastrophe|accumulation of oxygen]] in the Earth's atmosphere. Though oxygen is believed to have been released by [[photosynthesis]] as far back as [[Archean]] Eon, it could not build up to any significant degree until mineral sinks of [[Oxidation|unoxidized]] [[sulfur]] and [[iron]] had been filled. Until roughly 2.3 billion years ago, oxygen was probably only 1% to 2% of its current level.&lt;ref name=Stanley/&gt;{{rp|323}} The [[Banded iron formation]]s, which provide most of the world's [[iron ore]], are one mark of that mineral sink process. Their accumulation ceased after 1.9 billion years ago, after the iron in the oceans had all been oxidized.&lt;ref name=Stanley/&gt;{{rp|324}}

[[Red bed]]s, which are colored by [[hematite]], indicate an increase in atmospheric oxygen 2 billion years ago. Such massive iron oxide formations are not found in older rocks.&lt;ref name=Stanley/&gt;{{rp|324}} The oxygen buildup was probably due to two factors: a filling of the chemical sinks, and an increase in [[carbon burial]], which sequestered [[organic compound]]s that would have otherwise been oxidized by the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Stanley/&gt;{{rp|325}}

==Subduction processes==
&lt;!---[[File:Stromatolites Cochabamba.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Stromatolites]] Bolivia, South America]]---&gt;
The Proterozoic Eon was a very tectonically active period in the Earth’s history. The late Archean Eon to Early Proterozoic Eon corresponds to a period of increasing crustal recycling, suggesting [[subduction]]. Evidence for this increased subduction activity comes from the abundance of old granites originating mostly after 2.6&amp;nbsp;Ga.&lt;ref name=Kearey&gt;Kearey, P., Klepeis, K., Vine, F., Precambrian Tectonics and the Supercontinent Cycle, Global Tectonics, Third Edition, pp. 361–377, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The appearance of [[eclogite]]s, which [[metamorphic rocks]] created by high pressure (&gt;1&amp;nbsp;GPa), are explained using a model that incorporates subduction. The lack of eclogites that date to the Archean Eon suggests that conditions at that time did not favor the formation of high grade metamorphism and therefore did not achieve the same levels of subduction as was occurring in the Proterozoic Eon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bird|first1=P.|title=An updated digital model of plate boundaries|journal=Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems|date=2003|volume=4|issue=3|doi=10.1029/2001GC000252|bibcode=2003GGG.....4.1027B}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of remelting of [[basalt]]ic [[oceanic crust]] due to subduction, the cores of the first continents grew large enough to withstand the crustal recycling processes. The long-term tectonic stability of those [[craton]]s is why we find [[continental crust]] ranging up to a few billion years in age.&lt;ref&gt;Mengel, F., Proterozoic History, Earth System: History and Variablility, volume 2, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed that 43% of modern continental crust was formed in the Proterozoic, 39% formed in the Archean, and only 18% in the [[Phanerozoic]].&lt;ref name=Kearey/&gt;  Studies by Condie 2000{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} and Rino et al. 2004{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} suggest that crust production happened episodically. By isotopically calculating the ages of Proterozoic granitoids it was determined that there were several episodes of rapid increase in continental crust production. The reason for these pulses is unknown, but they seemed to have decreased in magnitude after every period.&lt;ref name=Kearey/&gt;

==Tectonic history (supercontinents)==
&lt;!---[[File:ZebRivStromatolites 2010.3.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Stromatolites]] Zebra River Canyon, Western Namibia]]---&gt;
Evidence of collision and rifting between continents raises the question as to what exactly were the movements of the Archean cratons composing Proterozoic continents. [[Paleomagnetism|Paleomagnetic]] and geochronological dating mechanisms have allowed the deciphering of Precambrian Supereon tectonics.  It is known that tectonic processes of the Proterozoic Eon resemble greatly the evidence of tectonic activity, such as [[orogenic belt]]s or [[ophiolite]] complexes, we see today. Hence, most geologists would conclude that the Earth was active at that time. It is also commonly accepted that during the Precambrian, the Earth went through several supercontinent breakup and rebuilding cycles ([[Wilson cycle]]).&lt;ref name=Kearey/&gt;  In the late Proterozoic (most recent), the dominant supercontinent was [[Rodinia]] (~1000–750&amp;nbsp;Ma). It consisted of a series of continents attached to a central craton that forms the core of the North American Continent called [[Laurentia]]. An example of an orogeny (mountain building processes) associated with the construction of Rodinia is the [[Grenville orogeny]] located in Eastern North America. Rodinia formed after the breakup of the supercontinent [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]] and prior to the assemblage of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]] (~500&amp;nbsp;Ma).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Condie|first1=K. C.|last2=O'Neill|first2=C.|title=The Archean-Proterozoic boundary: 500 my of tectonic transition in Earth history|journal=American Journal of Science|date=2011|volume=310|issue=9|pages=775–790|doi=10.2475/09.2010.01|bibcode=2010AmJS..310..775C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defining orogenic event associated with the formation of Gondwana was the collision of Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia forming the [[Pan-African orogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;Huntly, C., The Mozambique Belt, Eastern Africa: Tectonic Evolution of the Mozambique Ocean and Gondwana Amalgamation. The Geological Society of America. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbia was dominant in the early-mid Proterozoic and not much is known about continental assemblages before then. There are a few plausible models that explain tectonics of the early Earth pre-Columbia, but the current most plausible theory is that prior to Columbia, there were only a few independent craton formations scattered around the Earth (not necessarily a supercontinent formation like Rodinia or Columbia).&lt;ref name=Kearey/&gt;

The first advanced single-celled, [[eukaryotes]] and multi-cellular life, [[Francevillian Group Fossil]]s, roughly coincides with the start of the accumulation of free oxygen.&lt;ref name="albani"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=El Albani|first1= A. |last2=Bengtson|first2= S. |last3=Canfield|first3= D.

The blossoming of eukaryotes such as [[acritarch]]s did not preclude the expansion of cyanobacteria; in fact, [[stromatolites]] reached their greatest abundance and diversity during the Proterozoic, peaking roughly 1200 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Stanley/&gt;{{rp|321–3}}

Classically, the boundary between the Proterozoic and the [[Phanerozoic]] eons was set at the base of the [[Cambrian]] [[period (geology)|Period]] when the first fossils of animals including [[trilobite]]s and [[archaeocyatha|archeocyathids]] appeared. In the second half of the 20th century, a number of fossil forms have been found in Proterozoic rocks, but the upper boundary of the Proterozoic has remained fixed at the base of the Cambrian, which is currently placed at 541&amp;nbsp;Ma.

'''Residuum''' is often used to refer to the [[soil]] and [[subsoil]] that forms as the result of long weathering over [[carbonate rocks]] ([[limestone]] and [[dolostone|dolomite]]) [[bedrock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cs_isKFPJTwC&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;ots=Pi-qaM_7fz&amp;dq=residuum%20chert&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q=residuum%20chert&amp;f=false |title=Soil survey of Polk County, Missouri - Larry E.

Parent material is classified by mode of transport.

Parent material is one of the [[Clorpt|soil forming factors]] defined as “unconsolidated organic and mineral materials in which soils form”. Making Parent material an important part of the soil forming process. The other soil forming factors are climate, organisms, relief and time. Parent materials are classified by their mode of transport into a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://passel.unl.edu/pages/informationmodule.php?idinformationmodule=1130447021&amp;topicorder=3&amp;maxto=7&amp;minto=1|title=Plant and Soil Sciences eLibrary|website=passel.unl.edu|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; These modes of transport are by wind ([[Aeolian processes|aeloian]]), water, ice ([[Till|glacial till]]), lakes ([[Lake|lacustrine]]), oceans ([[Marine sediment|marine]]) or in place (non transported)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://passel.unl.edu/pages/informationmodule.php?idinformationmodule=1130447021&amp;topicorder=7&amp;maxto=7&amp;minto=1|title=Plant and Soil Sciences eLibrary|website=passel.unl.edu|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Soils derived from residuum are called residual soils. These soils are expected to mineralogically  similar to their underlying bedrock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=PLASTER|first=R. W.|last2=SHERWOOD|first2=W. C.|date=1971|title=Bedrock Weathering and Residual Soil Formation in Central Virginia|url=https://doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1971)82%5B2813:BWARSF%5D2.0.CO;2|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|language=en|volume=82|issue=10|pages=2813|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1971)82[2813:bwarsf]2.0.co;2|issn=0016-7606}}&lt;/ref&gt; While residuum is similar to the term [[regolith]], it is more specific. While [[regolith]] refers to all unconsolidated earth materials above the solid bed rock, including transported sediments such as sand or [[alluvium]], residuum is strictly a non transported parent material. However, parent materials formed in place or "[[In situ|in-situ]]" can further be classified as [[saprolite]] or residuum. Residuum differs from [[saprolite]] through its structure and degree of weathering. Saprolite is commonly referring to weathered material retaining details or structural features of the bedrock. The distinguishing feature between these is that residuum no longer retains the structural features or details of its bed rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-09-27|title=Residuum (geology)|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Residuum_(geology)&amp;oldid=802657832|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has undergone greater transformation and experienced a decrease in volume from its origins as saprolite and bedrock. This is what is known as [[Consolidation (soil)|consolidation]].

Residuum and their associated residual soils are a produced through chemical weathering of their bedrock. These soils and subsoils typically have their origins in hot humid tropical locations.

In limestone terrains the boundary between bedrock and residuum is commonly very sharp, but may be highly irregular, defining pinnacles and even isolated blocks of fresh bedrock surrounded by reddish residual [[silt]]s and [[clay]]s derived from its decomposition.  Resistant materials such as [[chert]], silicified [[fossil]]s, or beds of [[sandstone]] remain and may concentrate on the surface as float.

American Antiquity 54: 292-326.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone lines and stone zones are known to occur in [[soils]], [[paleosols]] (buried soils), and in non-soil geologic-stratigraphic sequences. Where present in stratigraphic sequences, if the units were deposited by running water, the stones are usually imbricated (individual stones are lapped, or leaning, upon one another in the direction of water flow). This is strong evidence that such stone lines are geogenic. On the other hand, a stone line that is present in a soil or a paleosol is invariable non-imbricated and follows (mimics) the surface topography of the soil, or the [[paleosurface]] of a paleosol. This is strong evidence that such stone lines are pedogenic, and produced by soil forming processes. As it turns out, experience has shown that most stone lines are indeed associated with soils and paleosols, and most are consequently assumed to be pedogenic.

'''''The Elephant Whisperer''''' published in April 2009 by Pan Macmillan in London and in July 2009 by Thomas Dunne/St Martin's Press in New York, is the second book written by South African author and [[conservation movement|conservationist]] [[Lawrence Anthony]] along with journalist Graham Spence.

==Overview==
This bestselling book tells the story of a herd of wild [[African elephant]]s on an African game reserve. The herd is destined to be shot for dangerous behaviour when Anthony intervenes to try to save their lives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2051">{{short description|The upper boundary of the thermosphere}}
The '''thermopause''' is the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] boundary of Earth's energy system, located at the top of the [[thermosphere]].&lt;ref name="Torres"&gt;Torres, Rafael Escribano (ed.)[https://books.google.com/books?id=7wNOoL-Lco8C&amp;pg=PA21 ''Spectroscopy of the Atmospheres''.] Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 2010. {{ISBN|978-84-00-09209-2}}. Retrieved January 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The temperature of the thermopause could range from absolute zero to {{convert|987.548|C|F|0}}.

Below this, the atmosphere is defined to be active on the [[insolation]] received, due to the increased presence of heavier gases such as monatomic oxygen.  The [[solar constant]] is thus expressed at the thermopause.  Beyond (above) this, the [[exosphere]] describes the thinnest remainder of atmospheric particles with large mean free path, mostly hydrogen and helium. As a limit for the exosphere this boundary is also called ''exobase''.&lt;ref name="Torres"/&gt;

The exact altitude varies by the energy inputs of location, time of day, solar flux, season, etc. and can be between {{convert|500|and|1000|km|mi}} high at a given place and time because of these.  A [[South Atlantic Anomaly|portion]] of the [[magnetosphere]] dips below this layer as well.

Although these are all named layers of the atmosphere, the pressure is so negligible that the chiefly-used definitions of [[outer space]] are actually below this altitude.  Orbiting satellites do not experience significant atmospheric heating, but their orbits do decay over time, depending on orbit altitude.  Space missions such as the [[International space station|ISS]], [[space shuttle]], and [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz]] operate under this layer.
