      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1380">'''The Acronym Institute for Disarmament Diplomacy''' was founded in 1995 by Dr. [[Rebecca Johnson (diplomat)|Rebecca Johnson]], senior advisor to the [[United Nations]]' ''[[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]]'' chaired by Dr. [[Hans Blix]] from January 2000 to June 2003.  It states as its goal "to promote effective approaches to international security, disarmament and arms control. ... Engaging with governments and civil society, Acronym provides reporting, analysis and strategic thinking on a range of issues relevant to peace and security, with special emphasis on treaties and multilateral initiatives."

The Acronym Institute has published the journal ''Disarmament Diplomacy'' since 1997 on a [[bi-monthly]] basis, with an overview of events relating to weapons proliferation and [[disarmament]].

The Acronym Institute was founded by Dr. Johnson as continuation of her work for ''The Acronym Consortium'' ([[VERTIC]], [[International Security Information Service|ISIS]], [[British American Security Information Council|BASIC]] and [[Dfax]]), which had dissolved into its constituent parts in October 1995.

The '''Athletic–Barcelona clásico''' refers to football matches between [[Athletic Bilbao]] and [[FC Barcelona]], two clubs competing in [[Football in Spain|Spanish football competitions]].

The two clubs are among the oldest in the country, and have participated in every season of the national championship, [[La Liga]]. Owing to this, as well as contesting eight finals of the [[Copa del Rey]]&lt;ref name=coperas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfef.es/noticias/copa-del-rey/barcelona-athletic-clasico-finales-coperas|title=FC Barcelona-Athletic Club, un clásico de las finales coperas|trans-title=FC Barcelona-Athletic Club, a cup final classic|language=Spanish|publisher=[[Royal Spanish Football Federation|RFEF]]|date=5 March 2015|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rivalidad&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amp.lne.es/deportes/2015/05/30/athletic-barcelona-vieja-rivalidad-copa/1765026.html|title=Athletic y Barcelona, una vieja rivalidad en la Copa |trans-title=Athletic and Barcelona, an old rivalry in the Cup|language=Spanish|work=[[La Nueva España]]|date=30 May 2015|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in which they are the two most successful clubs),&lt;ref name=otrogran/&gt; it is the third most-played football fixture in Spain, after the meetings of each with the third constant member of the league, [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]].

The relationship between Athletic and Barcelona has historically been fairly healthy aside from certain periods when competitiveness became hostility, such as in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=bitterest84/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://as.com/videos/2010/09/24/portada/1285279225_870215.html|title=La historia de la rivalidad entre Athletic y Barcelona|trans-title=The history of the rivalry between Athletic and Barcelona|language=Spanish|work=[[Diario AS]]|date=24 September 2010|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anotherway&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theblizzard.co.uk/article/other-rival-another-way|title=The Other Rival, Another Way|website=The Blizzard|author=Scott Oliver|date=1 March 2012|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the 21st century, the rivalry had largely become a historical concept due to the disparity in the fortunes of the clubs and the lack of a local element,&lt;ref name=march18&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/deportes/futbol/abci-barcelona-athletic-liga-santander-201803181500_directo.html|title=El Barça arrasa y se echa a dormir la siesta|trans-title=Barça cleans up and takes a nap|language=Spanish|quote=A game of old rivalry, so old that neither of the two teams seemed to remember.|work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|date=19 March 2018|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their frequent meetings in matches of importance, including three Copa del Rey finals,&lt;ref name=copa16&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/barca/todos-los-precedentes-del-athletic-club-barcelona-copa-del-rey-4818597|title=Todos los precedentes del Athletic Club - FC Barcelona en Copa del Rey|trans-title=All the precedents of Athletic Club - FC Barcelona in Copa del Rey|language=Spanish|work=Sport|date=15 January 2016|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; restored some relevancy to the fixture.

As the most successful clubs in their native regions (the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] for Athletic and [[Catalonia]] for Barcelona)&lt;ref name=anotherway/&gt; and seen by many of their supporters as the sporting embodiment of the native population, the clubs have important and similar roles in the national football culture, with Athletic's adherence to a unique [[Athletic Bilbao signing policy|'Basque only' player policy]] and Barcelona's efforts to become the world's best while maintaining and promoting a distinct Catalan identity exemplifying two diverse approaches to being a sporting symbol of their homelands.

Barcelona in particular have a far more intense rivalry with Real Madrid – perceived to represent the dominant [[Castile (historical region)|Castile region]] and the [[Spanish royal family]]&lt;ref name=interplay&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/game-politics-football-interplay-spain-180403172920861.html|title=More than a game: How politics and football interplay in Spain|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|author=David Child|date=18 April 2018|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; – sometimes known as the ''Gran Clásico'', it has become simply [[El Clásico]]; they also contest a [[List of association football club rivalries in Europe#Spain|local derby]] in [[Àrea Metropolitana de Barcelona|Greater Barcelona]] against  [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] which too has political aspects.&lt;ref name=where/&gt; Athletic Bilbao's [[El Viejo Clásico|attitude towards Real Madrid]] is also more frosty than their relationship with Barcelona due to the differences in the political and cultural identity of the clubs, and they have a significant local rivalry in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque autonomous region]] with [[Real Sociedad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espndeportes.espn.com/noticias/nota/_/id/2453031/las-rivalidades-en-la-liga-espanola|title=Las rivalidades en la liga española|trans-title=The rivalries in the Spanish league|language=Spanish|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=21 August 2015|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=special&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/3312276/athletic-bilbao-real-sociedad-ready-to-renew-a-special-basque-derby-rivalry|title=Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad ready to renew a special Basque derby rivalry|last=[[Sid Lowe|Lowe]]|first=Sid|publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=15 December 2017 |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The date of the first meeting between the two clubs is a matter of debate. The final of the [[1902 Copa de la Coronación]] was played between Barcelona and [[Bizcaya (football team)|Club Biscaya]] (a combined team of Athletic Club and [[:es:Bilbao FC|Bilbao FC]], which merged the following year); Biscaya won the match 2–1. Athletic regard themselves as the successor to the Biscaya team and the Copa Coronación as the first edition of the Copa del Rey, including it with later wins in their official honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.athletic-club.eus/en/honours.html|title=Honours; Mens Team; Cup |publisher=Athletic Bilbao|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|Spanish Federation]] gives 1903 as the commencement date for the Copa del Rey, disregarding the previous year's tournament in its records, so it has never been fully established if they regard Biscaya and Athletic as the same club or not. Barcelona's team in the final also included players from [[Football in Catalonia#Earliest Clubs|Hispania AC]], meaning theirs was also something of a combined force rather than a single club entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cihefe.es/cuadernosdefutbol/2009/11/la-copa-de-1902/ |title=Cuadernos de Fútbol: La Copa de 1902|trans-title=Football Notebooks: The 1902 Cup|publisher=[[:es:Centro de Investigaciones de Historia y Estadística del Fútbol Español|CIHEFE]]|language=Spanish|date=17 October 2009|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletic and Barcelona were both successful in the early years of the national cup: between 1903 and 1920, the Basques won seven ''Copas'' and the Catalans three (including wins for both in the [[1910 Copa del Rey|1910 edition]] where two competitions were held, both considered official retrospectively), but they did not face each other at any stage of the tournament until their first undisputed meeting in the [[1920 Copa del Rey Final|1920 Final]] held in [[Gijón]], which Barcelona won 2–0.&lt;ref name=copa16/&gt;&lt;ref name=rivalidad/&gt; In the following edition, Barcelona withdrew in protest after the federation changed the venue of [[1921 Copa del Rey Final|the final]] to Bilbao, and it was the 'home' club who eventually took the trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/spancup1921.html|title=Spain - Cup 1921 |author=José Vicente Tejedor |date=12 February 2001|publisher=[[RSSSF]] |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional qualifying leagues were introduced, and Athletic became the dominant club in the [[Biscay Championship]] (from 1913) while Barça were the strongest in the [[Catalan football championship]] (its earliest version was held in 1901). In that period, the two clubs introduced measures which led to them becoming important symbols of their respective homelands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/02/barcelona-in-strange-and-symbolic-eye-of-a-storm-over-catalonia|title=Barcelona in the strange and symbolic eye of a storm over Catalonia |newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 October 2017|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FourFourTwo06&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/basque-bone-why-athletic-bilbao-vs-real-sociedad-more-game?page=0%2C3|title=Basque to the bone?

===La Liga beginnings and Franco era===

[[File:A4467.jpg|thumb|left|Athletic's [[Telmo Zarra]] set the scoring record in the fixture in the 1940s and 50s]]
In the domestic league, the performances of Barcelona and Athletic were comparable until the 1960s, with the Basques winning only two titles during the period from 1939 to 1960 compared to seven for the Catalans, but both finishing near the top of the table most years. Athletic won seven cups to Barcelona's six, although the finals between them in [[1942 Copa del Generalísimo Final|1942]] and [[1953 Copa del Generalísimo Final|1953]] both went the way of the ''Blaugrana''.&lt;ref name=coperas/&gt;&lt;ref name=rivalidad/&gt; The Barça coach in the latter match, [[Ferdinand Daučík]], soon took over at Athletic, and won trophies with both clubs. 

Daučík had moved to Spain at the same time as his son-in-law and the club's star of the period, the Hungarian [[László Kubala]], who was the first of several foreign imports to make an impact (although the vast majority of players would remain Spanish until much later), winning the league several times plus two [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]]s and a [[Latin Cup]], and enduring a narrow defeat in the [[1961 European Cup Final]]; during his stay, the club also opened their massive ambitious [[Camp Nou]] stadium,&lt;ref name="fcbarcelona6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.es/club/noticias/2015-2016/24-de-septiembre-de-1957-inauguracion-del-camp-nou |title=24 de septiembre de 1957: Inauguración del Camp Nou|trans-title=24 September 1957: Inauguration of Camp Nou |publisher=FC Barcelona |language=Spanish|date=24 September 2015 |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cost of which would weaken the club economically for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/facilities/card/camp-nou-the-history |title=Camp Nou: the history|publisher=FC Barcelona |date=|accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real Madrid had moved to [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|a larger ground]] a few years earlier, and they too signed talent from Eastern Europe and South America as well as from around Spain which propelled them to further domestic and continental success, with the positive international exposure pleasing the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/franco-real-madrid-and-spanish-football-s-eternal-power-struggle-1-2564913|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Richard |title=Franco, Real Madrid and Spanish football’s eternal power struggle|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=7 October 2012|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletic and Barcelona both took part in the [[1976–77 UEFA Cup]] having won only one league title between them in almost two decades (Barça in [[1973–74 La Liga|1974]]), and both eager for glory in Europe. They were drawn together in the quarter-finals; it was the first time Athletic had played another Spanish team in a continental tournament. The two clubs had already played both league fixtures that season, the Catalans winning 3–1 in Bilbao and the Basques claiming a 2–0 victory at the [[Camp Nou]] ten days before their UEFA Cup tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/e1.html?cat=-&amp;temp=1976-77&amp;rival=6&amp;cas=0&amp;for=0|title=Barcelona matches (vs Athletic Club, season 1976-77)|publisher=BDFutbol|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tie was played in an unusually friendly atmosphere due to the similar regional identity of the two clubs, whose supporters were excited by the prospect of a [[Spanish transition to democracy|brighter future]] for their respective territories after the death of dictator [[General Franco]] and the weakening of [[Francoist Spain|his regime]]. By that point, the clubs' original names and identity were restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CRkIAcCB_0EC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=franco+atletico+name+1975&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YdlABzJ9Hy&amp;sig=Xg0TewP8ll3a1LtY-rDBv_PpC6E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5o5XkkufYAhXnBcAKHcKGBaIQ6AEIQjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=franco%20atletico%20name%201975&amp;f=false|title=The World's Game: A History of Soccer|last=Murray|first=William J.|ISBN=9780252067181|year=1998|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tie, Athletic held on for a 2–1 lead at San Mamés and led by the same scoreline by half time in the second leg thanks to a brace of away goals from [[Javier Irureta]], requiring Barça to score three more times in the last 45 minutes.

===Violence in 1983–84===
====Background====
By the early 1980s, Barcelona were becoming desperate for major success. They had still not won La Liga since 1974,&lt;ref name=eltel&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/thirty-years-how-el-tel-tamed-orwellian-beast-barcelona-and-won-la-liga|title=Thirty years on, how El Tel tamed the Orwellian beast of Barcelona and won La Liga|work=[[FourFourTwo]]|date=20 May 2014|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in addition to Real Madrid and [[Atlético Madrid]] who usually had talented squads, Real Sociedad from the Basque city of [[San Sebastián]] had assembled a strong team composed entirely of local homegrown talent, who finished above Barça in [[1978–79 La Liga|1979]] and continued to improve, being runners-up the following year before winning back-to-back titles in [[1980–81 La Liga|1981]] and [[1981–82 La Liga|1982]], overtaking Barcelona in the closing stages of the latter campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bdfutbol.com/en/t/t1981-82.html|title=Season 1981-82 First Division (table, results and progress chart)|website=BDfutbol|date=|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anotherway/&gt; The Catalans hired famous coaches [[Helenio Herrera]] and [[Udo Lattek]], but were left unsatisfied even with Copa victories in [[1978 Copa del Rey Final|1978]] and [[1981 Copa del Rey Final|1981]] (after overcoming Athletic in the semi0-finals)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hemeroteca-paginas.mundodeportivo.com./EMD01/HEM/1981/06/14/MD19810614-004.pdf|title=El soberbio marcaje de Manolo a Dani due clave|trans-title=The superb marking on Dani by Manolo was key|language=Spanish|newspaper=[[Mundo Deportivo]]|date=14 June 1981|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]s in [[1979 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1979]] and [[1982 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1982]].&lt;ref name=anotherway/&gt; They had paid a world record transfer fee to bring Argentina star [[Diego Maradona]] to the club, followed in 1983 by his compatriot and mentor [[César Luis Menotti]] as head coach.&lt;ref name=bitterest84&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beyondthelastman.com/2012/11/01/bilbao-v-barcelona-the-bitterest-rivalry/|title=Bilbao v Barcelona 1984: the bitterest rivalry|website=Beyond the last man|author=Craig McCracken|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, besides Real Sociedad (who were weakened when midfielder [[Miguel Ángel Alonso|Perico Alonso]] moved to Barça after their second title), it was also a strong period for Athletic Bilbao, who developed a group of talented but highly aggressive and physical players under coach [[Javier Clemente]].&lt;ref name=anotherway/&gt;&lt;ref name=bitterest84/&gt;&lt;ref name=eltel/&gt; Athletic took the title in [[1982–83 La Liga|1983]] (their first championship for 27 years)&lt;ref name=anotherway/&gt;&lt;ref name=clemente25&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eldiario.es/canariasahora/deportes/Clemente-anos-despues_0_221878224.html|title=Clemente, 25 años después|trans-title=Clemente, 25 years later|publisher=[[eldiario.es|El Diario (Canarias Ahora)]]|language=Spanish|date=15 September 2008|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; just ahead of Real Madrid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bdfutbol.com/en/t/t1982-83.html|title=Season 1982-83 First Division (table, results and progress chart)|website=BDfutbol|date=|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://footballrepublik.com/la-liga-seasons-athletic-bilbao-conquer-spain-198283/|title=La Liga seasons: Athletic Bilbao’s Basque Glory – 1982/83|work=Football Republik|date=24 August 2013|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Barcelona defeated their biggest rivals from the capital in the [[1983 Copa del Rey Final|cup final]].&lt;ref name=anotherway/&gt; It was clear that the following season could be a close affair between the three clubs, with the added elements of a clash in style and personality between Menotti and Clemente,&lt;ref name=bitterest84/&gt;&lt;ref name=eltel/&gt; who were not afraid of expressing their opinions to the press,&lt;ref name=anotherway/&gt;&lt;ref name=bitterest84/&gt;&lt;ref name=encendio/&gt; and the pervading feeling in Barcelona that their 1982 title bid had been ruined by a serious knee injury to influential midfielder [[Bernd Schuster]] sustained in a challenge from Athletic defender [[Andoni Goikoetxea Olaskoaga|Andoni Goikoetxea]].&lt;ref name=SZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=anotherway/&gt;&lt;ref name=bitterest84/&gt;&lt;ref name=encendio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com.mx/noticias/nota?s=esp&amp;id=1909591&amp;type=story|title=Encendió la rivalidad Athletic-Barça|trans-title=It sparked the Athletic-Barça rivalry|language=Spanish|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=24 September 2013|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maradona and Goiko====
[[File:Javier Clemente.jpg|thumb|left|[[Javier Clemente]] put together an Athletic side who were noted for their aggressive style]]
The season would be remembered for two of the most notorious incidents in Spanish football history, amidst a backdrop of serious tension in society, much of it due to terrorism committed by Basque separatists [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]].&lt;ref name=anotherway/&gt;&lt;ref name=SZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=bitterest84/&gt; The league schedule paired Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao at Camp Nou in the fourth round of fixtures in September 1983, and the home side were two goals ahead by the interval; early in the second half, Goikoetxea was angered by a hard tackle from Schuster, prompting Maradona to suggest that he calm down,&lt;ref name=SZ&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/fussball-historie-wie-holz-das-bricht-1.686363|title=Wie Holz, das bricht|trans-title=Like wood, it breaks|newspaper=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|last1=Cáceres|first1=Javier|language=German|date=17 May 2010|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a short time later, Maradona dribbled into space in midfield and was tackled crudely from behind by Goikoetxea, who appeared to make little attempt to play the ball and snapped Maradona's ankle.&lt;ref name=anotherway/&gt;&lt;ref name=bitterest84/&gt;&lt;ref name=encendio/&gt;&lt;ref name=hotfunks&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/dec/05/joy-of-six-scott-murray|title=The Joy of Six: hot football funks|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 December 2008|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the recklessness of the challenge, Goikoetxea was only cautioned. Barcelona went on to win 4–0, but lost Maradona until January 1984.&lt;ref name=encendio/&gt; The Athletic bus was stoned as it left the city.&lt;ref name=SZ/&gt; Goikoetxea, from then on widely referred to as the ''Butcher of Bilbao'' after the incident became widely publicised,&lt;ref name=SZ/&gt; was given an 18-match ban&lt;ref name=bitterest84/&gt; which was then reduced to nine then six,&lt;ref name=anotherway/&gt;&lt;ref name=encendio/&gt; meaning he returned in the November, and his importance to the team was underlined by the fact those were the only league matches he missed all season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/j2676.html?temp=1983-84|title=Matches of Andoni Goikoetxea in Season 1983-84|website=BDfutbol|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither player took part in either leg of the autumn [[1983 Supercopa de España]] between the sides, won 3–2 by Barcelona on aggregate,&lt;ref name=anotherway/&gt; but both were back in place for the league game at San Mamés in late January, in which Maradona, still recovering from the injury, scored both his team's goals in their 2–1 victory.&lt;ref name=greatgames/&gt;&lt;ref name=bitterest84/&gt;&lt;ref name=hotfunks/&gt; However, points dropped by the Catalans in other matches meant they were never able to pull ahead of Real Madrid or Athletic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bdfutbol.com/en/t/t1983-84.html|title=Season 1983-84 First Division (table, results and progress chart)|website=BDfutbol|date=|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in one of the tightest finishes in the competition's history, the Basques retained the title by dint of a superior head-to-head record over the ''Merengues'', with both a point ahead of Barcelona in the final table,&lt;ref name=anotherway/&gt;&lt;ref name=bitterest84/&gt; leading their followers to ponder how many they might have collected with Maradona available and fully fit;&lt;ref name=hotfunks/&gt; they would have only required one to overtake Athletic having won both meetings with them.

====Cup final====

A week later, the [[1984 Copa del Rey Final]] brought Athletic and Barcelona together at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium]] for their fifth meeting of the campaign. In a predictably physical game, Athletic won 1–0 through [[Endika Guarrotxena|Endika]] to clinch the [[Double (association football)|double]] for the first time since 1956.&lt;ref name=palos&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.es/20120524/deportes-futbol/abci-final-athletic-barcelona-1984-201205241339.html|title=Athletic-Barça 1984, la final de los palos|trans-title=Athletic-Barça 1984, the sticks final|language=Spanish|newspaper=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|date=25 May 2012|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goal84/&gt; Upon the final whistle, Maradona (who had been insulted by Clemente in the build-up and was fouled repeatedly during the match, particularly by his marker [[Iñigo Liceranzu]])&lt;ref name=anotherway/&gt;&lt;ref name=hotfunks/&gt;&lt;ref name=painful&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog/espn-fc-united/68/post/3059866/real-madrid-napoli-diego-maradona-returns-to-the-bernabeu-a-place-of-thrilling-and-painful-memories|title=Maradona returns to the Bernabeu, a place of thrilling and painful memories|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=13 February 2017|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was goaded by [[Miguel Ángel Sola|Miguel Sola]]&lt;ref name=bitterest84/&gt; and reacted by launching a flying kick.

====Aftermath====
The following campaign brought change for both clubs. At that time, the Supercopa was given automatically to any 'double' winners (rather than meeting the cup runners-up again, as was the case in later eras), thus Athletic were given the 1984 honour and another potentially hostile clash between the sides early in the season was avoided. Barcelona, having replaced Maradona and Menotti with Scottish striker [[Steve Archibald]] and English manager [[Terry Venables]],&lt;ref name=eltel/&gt; finally won the [[1984–85 La Liga|league title]]. Athletic reached the [[1985 Copa del Rey Final|cup final]] again but lost to Atlético Madrid, and they would not reach another for a generation as a gradual decline set in.&lt;ref name=clemente25/&gt;

The [[1985–86 Copa del Rey#Semi-finals|1986 Copa semi-finals]] again saw Athletic and Barcelona drawn together, and the second leg at San Mamés (won 2–1 by Barcelona)&lt;ref name=hell/&gt; saw incidents of objects being thrown by the crowd, a pitch invasion and insults made to the referee by Bilbao staff members, resulting in their stadium being closed for the next fixture, the first time this had occurred;&lt;ref name=closes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/1986/04/11/deportes/513554411_850215.html|title=El Comité de Competición sanciona a Dani y De Andrés y clausura el campo del Athlétic por un partido|trans-title=The Competition Committee sanctions Dani and De Andrés and closes the Athlétic ground for one match |language=Spanish|newspaper=[[El País]]|date=11 April 1986|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the hostile environment and disorder resulted largely from anger at the decisions and behaviour of the officials (who appeared to miss a foul during a Barça goal and failed to award a penalty to the home side)&lt;ref name=hell&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hemeroteca-paginas.mundodeportivo.com./EMD01/HEM/1986/04/10/MD19860410-003.pdf|title=1-2: Del infierno a la final|trans-title=1-2: From hell to the final|language=Spanish|newspaper=[[Mundo Deportivo]]|date=10 April 1986|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=closes/&gt; rather than hostility towards the opposition.

A month later, Barcelona made it to the [[1986 European Cup Final]] held on Spanish soil, but unexpectedly lost to [[FC Steaua București|Steaua București]]. They had just confirmed the signing of Athletic's goalkeeper [[Andoni Zubizarreta]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/diario/1986/05/03/deportes/515455211_850215.html|title=El Barcelona ficha a Zubizarreta por 150 millones|trans-title=Barcelona sign Zubizarreta for 150 million|newspaper=[[El País]]|language=Spanish|date=3 May 1986|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who would be an important figure in the years to come. Thereafter, both clubs suffered as Real Madrid, led by '[[La Quinta del Buitre]]', won five championships in a row.&lt;ref name=marcaquinta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2017/05/22/5922e820ca4741256a8b462d.html|title=The Real Madrid of La Quinta|work=Marca|date=22 May 2017|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
By the 1990s, the clubs were no longer competing at the same level of performance. Under Johan Cruijff as coach, Barcelona introduced innovative methods to be used at all levels of the club, which would still be in effect decades later.&lt;ref name="SidLowe"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/24/johan-cruyff-barcelona-legacy |author=[[Sid Lowe|Lowe, Sid]] |title=Barcelona were transformed by Johan Cruyff not once but twice, and for ever |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="FCB_Cruyff88-96"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/history/card/johan-cruyff-1988-96 |title=FC Barcelona: Johan Cruyff (1988–96) |publisher= FC Barcelona |accessdate=16 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to four successive league titles, they won another Cup Winners' Cup in [[1989 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1989]] then finally achieved their aim of winning the European Cup in [[1992 European Cup Final|1992]] (defeating [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] on both occasions); the ''Dream Team'' built by Cruijff included several Basques, such as [[Ernesto Valverde|Valverde]] (whose next move was to Bilbao and later coached both clubs),&lt;ref name=whoishe&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/sport/barcelona-have-named-ernesto-valverde-as-their-new-head-coach-but-who-is-he-791664.html|title=Barcelona have named Ernesto Valverde as their new head coach ... but who is he?|work=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=29 May 2017|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the former Athletic players [[José Ramón Alexanko|Alexanko]], Zubizarreta and [[Julio Salinas]], and a winger known as [[Ion Andoni Goikoetxea|Andoni Goikoetxea]] (a different man from the defender who had injured Maradona). Athletic, who finished above Barcelona only once following their double win – in [[1987–88 La Liga|1988]] – continued to produce some good players, with [[Julen Guerrero]] considered the best of the era,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://athletic.elcorreo.com/leyendas/guerrero.html|title=Leyendas del Athletic Club de Bilbao:Guerrero|trans-title=Legends of the Athletic Club of Bilbao: Guerrero|language=Spanish|newspaper=[[El Correo]]|date=|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=warns&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/news/2015-2016/former-athletic-legend-julen-guerrero-warns-athletic-will-be-no-pushovers|title=Former Athletic legend Julen Guerrero warns Basques will be no pushovers |publisher=FC Barcelona|date=26 January 2016|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but usually had to content themselves with finishing mid-table.

Following the 1996 [[Bosman ruling]], the gap widened further; with no limitations on signing players from the [[European Union]], clubs such as Barcelona could and did bring in the best talent from across the continent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2010/09/25/futbol/1285423275.html|title=Bosman, el jugador mediocre que cambió el fútbol moderno|trans-title=Bosman, the mediocre player who changed modern football|language=Spanish|work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|date=14 December 2015|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; – their [[1998–99 FC Barcelona season|squad in 1999, their centenary season]] included eight [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch internationals]] as well as three Brazilians, an Argentine, a Portuguese and five who had represented [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. Both clubs competed in the [[1998–99 UEFA Champions League group stage]] after [[1997–98 La Liga|the previous domestic league]] was won by Barça with Athletic runners-up (in their centenary year), marking their best finish since 1984 which they have not matched since as the league took on an increasingly international profile, becoming the [[UEFA coefficient#Top leagues by period|strongest in Europe]] by the end of the turn of the millennium.

===21st century===
Entering the 21st century, Athletic endured some [[History of Athletic Bilbao#The "black biennium"|struggles with relegation]] while Barcelona also had a [[History of FC Barcelona#The Gaspart Era (2000–2003)|relatively disappointing period]] but then recovered and continued to grow increasingly more [[Forbes' list of the most valuable football clubs|rich]], [[Supporters of FC Barcelona|popular]] and [[International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics#Club World Ranking|successful]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = World Football: The 11 Most Successful European Clubs in History | url = http://bleacherreport.com/articles/510011-world-football-the-11-most-successful-european-clubs-in-history/page/12 | accessdate =16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; attracting several of the world's top players and drawing among the biggest crowds in Europe to their stadium.&lt;ref name=att&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn.htm|title=Attendances (Filter: Europe)|website=European Football Statistics|date=|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Frank Rijkaard]], Barcelona won the Champions League in [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final|2006]] while also developing a highly talented group from their Cruijff-inspired [[La Masia|youth system]] who would lead them to even greater success including three more continental titles, led by forward [[Leo Messi]] who [[Football records in Spain#Goalscoring|broke virtually all]] of Zarra's longstanding records.&lt;ref name=messistats/&gt;&lt;ref name=zarra14/&gt;&lt;ref name=zarra15/&gt;&lt;ref name=zarra17/&gt;&lt;ref name=zmnightmare/&gt;&lt;ref name=zarra18/&gt; At international level, the revived [[Basque Country national football team|Basque]] and [[Catalonia national football team|Catalan]] representative teams (described as [[State of Origin]] squads)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/spain/10541466/Catalonia-and-Basque-Country-reignite-call-for-independent-national-football-identities.html|title=Catalonia and Basque Country reignite call for independent national football identities|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 December 2013|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; met four times between 2006 and 2015, with several Barcelona and Athletic players involved each time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eff-fvf.eus/pub/verFichaPartido.asp?idioma=ca&amp;idPartido=146|title=Catalunya 2–2 Euskadi|language=Spanish|publisher=[[Basque Football Federation]]|date=8 October 2006|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eff-fvf.eus/pub/verFichaPartido.asp?idioma=ca&amp;idPartido=149|title=Euskal Herria 1–1 Catalunya |language=Spanish|publisher=[[Basque Football Federation]]|date=29 December 2007|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mundodeportivo.com/20141228/futbol/1-1-euskadi-y-catalunya-empatan-a-goles-en-el-partido-del-centenario_54422189959.html|title=1–1: Euskadi y Catalunya empatan a goles en el partido del Centenario|trans-title=1–1: Basque Country and Catalonia draw in the Centenary match|language=Spanish|work=[[Mundo Deportivo]]|date=29 December 2014|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://as.com/futbol/2015/12/26/mas_futbol/1451170418_459821.html|title=Aduriz da un nueva victoria de Euskadi ante Cataluña|trans-title=Aduriz gives a new victory for the Basques against Catalonia|language=Spanish|work=[[Diario AS]]|date=27 December 2015|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Basque nationalism|Basque independence]] is an issue which continues to occupy the political scene in that region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-44431122|title=Spain's Basques form human chain calling for independence vote|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=10 June 2018|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with nationalist parties consistently receiving high percentages in elections. As with Barcelona, independence is a concept which is favoured by many of the Athletic Bilbao supporters in a wider context,&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; but its implementation could result in their club being the largest in a hypothetical 'Basque League' with only a small number of professional teams, as well as bringing to an end their proud record of longevity competing in the Spanish league.

Relegation (which has not concerned Barcelona for many years) is the other, more straightforward, issue for Athletic which could end that sequence. The club's poor performance in the [[2017–18 La Liga]] recalled more serious concerns over losing their league place a decade earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/dec/04/europeanfootball.sport1|title=Are Bilbao about to bow out? |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=4 December 2006|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to so few eligible players being available under the limitations of their policy, they cannot simply buy their way out of trouble in a bad run of form.&lt;ref name=policy&gt;{{cite web|author=Pete Jenson |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/pete-jenson-athletic-bilbao-s-locals-only-transfer-policy-shows-success-does-not-need-to-be-bought-9692663.html |title=Pete Jenson: Athletic Bilbao's locals-only transfer policy shows success does not need to be bought |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=26 August 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous surveys with supporters indicated the vast majority would rather see the team relegated than abandon their self-imposed restrictions on players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1940809-athletic-bilbao-vs-real-madrid-a-tale-of-two-transfer-policies|title=Athletic Bilbao vs. Real Madrid: A Tale of 2 Transfer Policies |website=Bleacher Report|date=31 January 2014|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Senatsglocke.jpg|thumb|The Senate Bell]]
The '''Bavarian Senate''' (German ''Bayerischer Senat'') was the corporative [[upper house|upper chamber]] of [[Free State of Bavaria|Bavaria's]] parliamentary system from 1946 to 1999, when it was abolished by a [[Referendum|popular vote]] (referendum) changing the constitution of this State of the German federation.

== Composition ==
The 60 members of the Senate had to be 40 years of age and could not be a member of the [[Landtag of Bavaria|Landtag]] (the other and more important chamber of the Bavarian parliament). Every other year, a third of the Senate's members would be elected by corporations representing social, economic, municipal or cultural groups or appointed by religious denominations for a term of six years. The number of seats representing each group was fixed by the constitution of Bavaria:

* 11 representatives of [[agriculture]] or [[forestry]]
* 5 representatives of [[industry]] and [[trade (occupation)|trade]]
* 5 representatives of [[Artisan|craftsmen]]
* 11 representatives of [[trade union|unions]]
* 4 representatives of [[profession]]s
* 5 representatives of [[cooperatives]]
* 5 representatives of [[religious denomination]]s
* 5 representatives of [[social welfare]] organisations
* 3 representatives of [[university|universities]] and [[college]]s
* 6 representatives of [[municipality|municipal]]ities and municipal associations

Internationally, the Senate's composition was similar to the [[Vocational panel]]s in the [[Seanad Éireann|Irish senate]]. It also bore remnants of [[council communism|council-democratic]] ideas.

== Role ==
The Senate's main role was consulting other state institutions and delivering legal opinion. It also had the power to delay state [[legislation]] passed by the Landtag within a month (one week for urgent acts). However, the Landtag could overturn the veto by a [[Plurality (voting)|simple majority]], the same majority required to pass a law in the first place.

== Criticism and dissolution ==
In the 1990s, public opinion in [[Germany]] turned towards [[lean Government|leaner government]]. The Senate, due to being essentially powerless, was regarded by many as an unnecessary expenditure.

In June 1997, a [[popular initiative]] petition sponsored by the [[Ecological Democratic Party]] gained 927,047 signatures (10.5% of those entitled to vote). In the following [[referendum]] on 8 February 1998, which yielded a turnout of 39.9%, a majority of 69.2% voted for the law amending the State Constitution to abolish the Senate. A counter-proposal by the ruling [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]], which would have changed the composition of the Senate, only received 23.6%.

On 1 January 2000, the law abolishing the Senate came into effect.

{{Update|date=May 2017}}

The '''Partido Cannabis por la Legalización y la Normalización''' (PCLYN; {{lang-en|Cannabis Party for Legalisation and Normalisation}}) was formed at the end of 2003 in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], Spain, although its first Congress was held in January 2004. At the beginning it was promoted by a Spanish association called Cannabis Culture Association (Asociación de la Cultura Cannábica also called ''La Barraca de María''), the Cannabis internet cafe association,  A.I.C.C. (Asociación de Internautas Cannabis Café -Association of Cannabis Caffe Internauters), and the Federation of Cannabis Associations (F.A.C. Federación de Asociaciones Cannábicas - Federation of associations) among others.

In its early days the party suffered a split, with those belonging to the AICC resigning from the party in February 2004. Other members became dissatisfied with the leadership of the party and its internal electoral processes following the partys first general meeting in May 2003. The splits caused logistical problems for the party which also suffered external attacks such as a denial of service attack on their web host on 16 May 2004. Nonetheless the party continued its activities, holding meetings with groups such as Republican Left ([[ERPV]]) or the [[Confederation of the Greens]] and with [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] members. Subsequently, the party was reformed and reorganised.

In October 2006, the original members of the party announced its reformation. They were led by the afiliated nº155 called [[deLambsy]], a surrealist artist who had been a member of the party since July 2004 when he was studying Arts in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]].

== Elections results of Cannabis Party in Spain ==

* Municipal Elections of 25-05-2003 (Valencia): 4,176 votes.

'''Chen Duxiu''' ({{zh|t=陳獨秀|w=Ch'en Tu-hsiu}}; October 8, 1879 – May 27, 1942) was a Chinese [[revolutionary socialist]], educator, philosopher, and author, who co-founded the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] (with [[Li Dazhao]]) in 1921, serving from 1921 to 1927 as its first [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]]. Chen was a leading figure in the [[Xinhai Revolution]] that overthrew the [[Qing dynasty]] and the [[May Fourth Movement]] for scientific and democratic developments in [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|early Republic of China]]. Expelled from the Communist Party in 1929, he was for a time the leader of China's small [[Trotskyist]] movement.

Chen's [[Ancestral home (China)|ancestral home]] was in [[Anqing]], [[Anhui]], where he established the influential [[vernacular Chinese]] [[periodical]] ''[[New Youth (Xin Qingnian)]]''.

==Biography==

===Life in the Qing dynasty===
Chen Duxiu was born in the city of [[Anqing]], in [[Anhui]] province. He was born to a wealthy family of officials, the youngest of four children. In his youth, he was described as volatile, emotional, intuitive, non-intellectual, and a defender of the underdog.{{sfn|Spence|1999|p=303}}  His father died when Chen was two years old, and he was raised primarily by his grandfather; and, later, by his older brother.

Chen was given a traditional [[Confucian]] education by his grandfather, several private tutors, and his elder brother.{{sfn|Chow|2009}} A thorough knowledge of Confucian literary and philosophical works was the pre-requisites for civil service in Imperial China. Chen was an exceptional student, but his poor experiences taking the [[Imperial examination|Confucian civil service exams]] resulted in a lifelong tendency to advocate unconventional beliefs and to criticize traditional ideas.

Chen took and passed the county-level [[imperial examination]] (乡试/鄉試) in 1896, and succeeded in the provincial-level examination (省试/省試) the following year.{{sfn|Chow|2009}} He later wrote a sardonic memoir in which he reminisced about the filthy conditions, the dishonesty, and the incompetence that he observed when taking the official examinations.{{sfn|Spence|1999|p=303}}  1898, he passed the entrance exam and became a student of [[Qiushi Academy]] (currently [[Zhejiang University]]) in [[Hangzhou]], where he studied French, English, and naval architecture.{{sfn|Chow|2009}} He moved to [[Nanjing]] in 1902, after he was reported to have given speeches attacking the Qing government, and then to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] the same year under a scholarship from the government to study at the [[Tokyo Shimbu Gakko]], a military preparatory academy. It was in Japan where Chen became influenced by [[socialism]] and the growing Chinese dissident movement. While studying in Japan, Chen helped to found two radical political parties, but refused to join [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s [[Tongmenghui]] Revolutionary Alliance, which he regarded as narrowly racist.{{sfn|Spence|1999|p=303}} In 1908, he accepted a teaching position at the Army Elementary School in [[Hangzhou]].{{sfn|Chow|2009}}{{sfn|Chao|2009}}{{Page needed|date=March 2018}}

===Life in the early republic===

[[File:Hu Hsen Hsu and Hu Shih.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Chen Duxiu]](left) and [[Hu Shih]](right)]]

From the late 19th century through the early the 20th century, the [[Qing Dynasty]] had suffered a series of military defeats against the colonial foreign powers, most recently in the [[First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895)]] and the war against the [[Alliance of Eight Nations]] that invaded China in reaction to the 1901 [[Boxer Rebellion]]. At the same time, widespread corruption within the Qing bureaucracy had left the empire in a state of total economic paralysis. Against this background Chen Duxiu became an increasingly influential activist in the revolutionary movement against both foreign imperialism and the Qing government itself.

Influenced by his time in Japan, Chen founded the [[Anhui Patriotic Association]] in 1903 and the [[Yuewang Hui]] in 1905. He was an outspoken writer and political leader by the time of the [[Wuchang Uprising]] of 1911, which started the [[Xinhai Revolution]] and led to the collapse of the Qing Dynasty. In 1912, Chen became secretary general to the new military governor of Anhui, while also serving as the dean of a local high school. However, Chen fled to Japan again in 1913 following the short-lived "Second Revolution" against [[Yuan Shikai]], but returned to China soon afterwards.{{sfn|Chow|2009}}

In 1915, Chen founded the journal "Youth" in Shanghai. In 1916 the name was changed to "New Youth." It quickly became the most popular and widely distributed journal in China. This journal published articles attacking conservative Chinese morality and promoting individualism. The journal was highly critical of Confucianism, and carried articles promoting the adoption of a Western moral system valuing human rights, democracy, and science, which he believed Confucianism opposed. Chen used the journal to promote vernacular writing at the expense of traditional Confucian writing conventions.{{sfn|Spence|1999|pp=303-304}}

Chen joined the faculty of [[Peking University]] in 1917 as the university's dean, at the invitation of [[Cai Yuanpei]], who also paid for moving Chen's journal to Beijing.{{sfn|Spence|1999|p=303}} A Marxist study group at the university, led by [[Li Dazhao]], attracted his attention in 1919. At the time, ''New Youth'' was highly popular, and Chen decided to run a special edition on Marxism with Li Dazhao as the edition's general editor. The edition of this magazine was the most detailed analysis of Marxism then published in China, and achieved wide readership due to the journal's popularity. Chen's decision to run this edition, and his activities in the [[May Fourth Movement]] that same year, motivated conservative opponents within the university to force his resignation in the fall of 1919.{{sfn|Spence|1999|p=296}} Around the time that he was forced out of Peking University, he was jailed for three months for distributing literature that Peking authorities considered inflammatory, demanding that all pro-Japanese ministers resign, and that the government guarantee freedom of speech and assembly. After his release, Chen moved to [[Shanghai]] and became more interested in Marxism and the promotion of rapid social change.{{sfn|Spence|1999|p=304}} His settlement in the [[French Concession]].{{sfn|Spence|1999|p=309}} allowed him to pursue his intellectual and scholarly interests free from official persecution.

===Career within the Chinese Communist Party===

====Founding the Chinese Communist Party====
In 1921, Chen Duxiu, [[Li Dazhao]] and other prominent revolutionary leaders founded the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC). It has been generally asserted that Chen, Li and the other Chinese radicals of the time (including future chairman [[Mao Zedong]]) formed the CPC out of diligent study of Marxist theories, inspired by the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].{{sfn|Chow|2009}} Many of the prominent members of the party in 1920 had a very poor understanding of Marxist theory. Over time, the more prominent revolutionaries attracted to the early Chinese Communist Party eventually adopted a more orthodox interpretation of Communism, and were organized through the influence of a [[Comintern]] advisor, [[Grigori Voitinsky]], who made a tour of China during 1920-21.{{fact|date=March 2016}}

At the [[1st National Congress of the Communist Party of China|First Congress of the Communist Party in Shanghai]], Chen was elected (in absentia) as the party's first General Secretary; and, with the assistance of [[Li Dazhao]], he developed what would become a crucial cooperative relationship with the International Communist Movement, the Comintern. This cooperation with the Comintern would later prove to be a problem for the fledgling CPC over the next decade, as aggressive foreign Comintern advisors would try to force policy according to the wishes of [[Moscow]] and against the will of many prominent CPC leaders, often for the national interest of the [[USSR]].{{sfn|Columbia|2001}}  By 1922, the size of the entire Communist Party in China was only about 200 members, not counting those overseas.{{sfn|Spence|1999|p=312}}  Chen remained as the undisputed leader of the Chinese Communist Party until 1927, and was often referred to as "China's Lenin" during this period.{{sfn|Chow|2009}}

====Subsequent efforts to spread communism====
Soon after the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, in 1921, Chen accepted an invitation from [[Chen Jiongming]] to serve on the education board in [[Guangzhou]] in the aftermath of the [[June 16 Incident]], but this position dissolved when Guangzhou was recaptured by the Kuomintang. At the direction of the Comintern, Chen and the Chinese Communists formed an alliance with [[Sun Yat-sen]] and the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT or Nationalist Party) in 1922. Although Chen was not convinced of the utility of collaborating with the Kuomintang, he reluctantly carried out the Comintern's orders to do so. Pursuing collaboration with the Kuomintang, he was elected into that party's Central Committee in January, 1924.{{sfn|Chow|2009}}

In 1927, he and other high-ranking Communists, including [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Mikhail Borodin]], collaborated closely with [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Nationalist government in Wuhan, convincing Wang's regime to adopt various proto-Communist policies. The Wuhan government's subsequent land reform policies were considered provocative enough to influence various KMT-aligned generals to attack Wang's regime, suppressing it.{{sfn|Spence|1999|pp=338-339}} Chen was forced to resign as General Secretary in 1927, due to his public dissatisfaction with the Comintern order to disarm during the [[April 12 Incident]], which had led to the deaths of thousands of Communists - now known as the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927]], and because of his disagreement with the Comintern's new focus on peasant rebellions.

====Conflict with Mao====
Chen came into conflict with [[Mao Zedong]] in 1925 over Mao's essay "An Analysis of Classes in Chinese Society". Mao, promoted by [[Stalin]] against the old leadership of the party from the time of Lenin,{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} opposed Chen's analyses of China. While Chen believed that the focus of revolutionary struggle in China should primarily concern the workers, Mao had started to theorize about the primacy of the peasants. According to [[Han Suyin]] in ''Mortal Flower'', Chen "opposed the opinions expressed [in Mao's analysis], denied that a radical land policy and the vigorous organization of the rural areas under the Communist party was necessary, and refused the publication of the essay in the central executive organs of publicity."

Although he recognized the value of Mao's interpretation of Marxism in inciting the Chinese peasants and labourers to revolution, Chen opposed Mao's rejection of the strong role of the bourgeoisie that Chen had hoped to achieve. During the last years of his life, Chen denounced Stalin's dictatorship, and held that various democratic institutions, including independent judiciaries, opposition parties, a free press, and free elections, were important and valuable. Because of Chen's opposition to Mao's interpretation of Communism, Mao believed that Chen was incapable of providing a robust [[historical materialism|historical materialist]] analysis of China. This dispute would eventually lead to the end of Chen and Mao's friendship and political association.{{sfn|Chow|2009}}

====Expelled by the Party====
After the collaboration between the Communist Party and the KMT fell apart in 1927, the Comintern blamed Chen, and systematically removed him from all positions of leadership. In November 1929, he was expelled. Afterwards, Chen became associated with the [[International Left Opposition]] of [[Leon Trotsky]]. Like Chen, Trotsky opposed many of the policies of the Comintern, and publicly criticized the Comintern's effort to collaborate with the Nationalists. Chen eventually became the voice of the Trotskyists in China, attempting to regain support and influence within the party, but failed.{{sfn|Chow|2009}} Chen continued to oppose measures like "New Democracy" and the "Bloc of Four Classes" advocated by [[Mao Zedong]].

===Last years===

In 1932, Chen was arrested by the government of the [[Shanghai International Settlement]], where he had been living since 1927, and extradited to Nanjing. Chen was then tried and sentenced to fifteen years in prison by the Nationalist government. Chen was released on parole in 1937, after the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].{{sfn|Chow|2009}}

Chen was one of the few early leaders of the Communist party to survive the turmoil of the 1930s, but he was never able to regain any influence within the party he had founded. For the last decade of his life, he faded into obscurity. 
At the time that he was released, both the supporters of Chen and the pro-Comintern leaders who opposed him had either been killed or had fallen out of favor with the Communist membership. The Chinese Communist Party only managed to survive the purges by fleeing to the northern frontier in the [[Long March]] of 1934-5, during which Mao Zedong emerged as leader. If only for sheer survival, the Communists had to flee the cities where China's fledgling industrial working class was concentrated, seek refuge in remote rural areas, and there mobilize the support of peasants; this was naturally taken as a vindication of Mao's position in his debate with Chen. Mao and this new generation of Communists would lead the party in China for the next fifty years.

On August 23rd Chen was released from prison and refused multiple offers of positions from the Guomindang saying that despite the importance of the war effort "Chiang Kai-shek killed many of my comrades he also killed my two sons, he and I are absolutely irreconcilable". In August 1937, Chen met with the heads of the Chinese Communist Party Office in Nanjing. This led to a concerted attempt by [[Luo Han]] and [[Ye Jianying]] to allow Chen to return to the Party. In September Mao responded saying that Chen could rejoin the party if he agreed to publicly renounce Trotskyism and express support for the United Front against Japan. Chen responded by letter to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party that he agreed with its line of resistance but would not renounce Trotskyism. This was the end of the last serious attempt to rejoin the CCP.{{sfn|Benton|2017|pp=97-98}}

Chen then travelled from place to place until the summer of 1938, when he arrived at the wartime capital of [[Chongqing]] and took a position teaching at a junior high school.  In poor health and with few remaining friends, Chen Duxiu later retired to [[Jiangjin]], a small town west of Chongqing, where he died in 1942 at the age of 62.{{sfn|Chow|2009}}  Today, he is buried at his birthplace of Anqing.

===Legacy===
After the founding of the PRC in 1949, Chen's example was used to warn Communist Party members not to deviate from party orthodoxy. In the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]], the example of Chen in collaborating with [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Wuhan government, leading to the ostracism of his peers and the failure of Communist policies at the time, was used by [[Peng Zhen]] as a warning never to "forgive" anti-Maoists.{{sfn|Spence|1999|p=543}} After Mao died in 1976, [[Hua Guofeng]] gave a speech praising Mao's suppression of "Right and 'Left' Opportunist lines of the Party" as one of the late Chairman's greatest achievements: Chen was the first person to be named as being correctly suppressed; [[Deng Xiaoping]] was the last.{{sfn|Spence|1999|p=615}}

In 1951 [[Hu Qiaomu]]'s "Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party" was published and deemed by the Party to be its authoritative history.{{sfn|Weigelin-Schwiedrzik|1993|p=154}}  In it Chen was denounced as: 1) Bourgeois democracy opportunist 2) Right opportunist 3) Right capitulationist 4) Factionalist 5) anti-Soviet 6) anti-Comintern 7) Anti-Party 8) Counter-revolutionary 9) [[Hanjian|Traitor to China]] and 10) Turncoat. In 1956 Mao Zedong said that Chen represented the gravest of all of the Right deviations in the party's history to that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-5/mswv5_52.htm ''U.S. Imperialism is a paper tiger''] Interview with Chairman Mao ''[[Marxists Internet Archive]]'' 14 July 1956&lt;/ref&gt;  Chen's contributions to the Party have subsequently been reassessed, however. Hong Kong historian Tang Baolin called Hu's verdict on Chen the greatest miscarriage of justice in the Party's history&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinanews.com/cul/2013/11-15/5508420.shtml "Chen Biography Author: Mao Zedong's 'Nobility'"] ''[[Shenzhen Daily]]'' 15 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and although his reassessment of Chen has not been officially endorsed by the Party, it was published in 2009 by the Chinese Literature and History Press which is run by the National Committee of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.people.com.cn/n/2012/0903/c198865-18901199.html The greatest injustice in the history of the CPC: Chen's nine charges all groundless] in ''Declassified documents in the broad historical picture'' Ye Kuangzheng ed. ''Chinese Literature and History Press'' February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==

===Writing style===
Chen felt that his articles should reflect the needs of society. He believed that the progress of society could not be achieved without those who accurately report social weaknesses and sicknesses.

Chen's articles were always expressive. He criticized the traditional Chinese officials as [[Political corruption|corrupt]] and guilty of other wrongdoings. He was under constant attack from conservatives in China, and had to flee to Japan four times. In China, he spent much of his life in the [[French Concession]] and the [[Shanghai International Settlement]] in order to pursue his writing and scholarly activities free from official harassment.

Chen's articles strove to attract publicity, and often arouse discussion by using [[hyperbole]]. He emphasized his sadness about the backwardness and corruption in China so that people suffering would be willing to send him their opinions. In ''New Youth'', he wrote various articles using [[pseudonym]]s to form "discussions", in order to arouse public interest.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Chen's publications emphasized the responses from their audience. In ''New Youth'' there were forums and citizens' columns. On average, there were 6 letters from the public in each issue. Whether in praise or strong opposition, Chen encouraged all to write. He also thought that teamwork was very important in journalism, and consequently asked for help from many talented authors and journalists, including [[Hu Shih]] and [[Lu Xun]].

===Journalistic works===

====''Anhui Suhua Bao''====
On March 31, 1904, Chen founded ''[[Anhui Suhua Bao]]'', a newspaper that he established with [[Fang Zhiwu]]  and [[Wu Shou]]  in Tokyo to promote revolutionary ideas using [[vernacular Chinese]], which was simple to understand and easy for the general public to read. While Chen was the chief secretary of the newspaper, its circulation increased from only a thousand copies to more than three times that figure in less than half a year, becoming one of the most popular [[vernacular Chinese]] newspapers in print at that time. During 1904 and 1905, a total of twenty-three issues were published. Each issue had 40 pages - about 15,000 words. However, due to political pressures, the paper was barred from publishing in 1905.

Chen had three main objectives in publishing ''Anhui Suhua Bao'': to let his countrymen in Anhui keep abreast of the politics of the Qing Dynasty; to spread knowledge to the paper's readers through vernacular Chinese; and, to promote revolutionary ideas to the public. Chen believed that most Chinese believed that the importance of the family was greater than that of the state, and that this limited their interest in political events. He also found Chinese people in general to be excessively [[superstitious]]. Chen urged Chinese people to participate in politics through the publication of ''Anhui Suhua Bao''. After its sixteenth issue, the newspaper added an extra 16 columns; the most popular were on military events, Chinese philosophy, hygiene, and astronomy. Almost all of these additional topics were written by Chen. His pen-name was San'ai (三爱/三愛). At least 50 articles were published under this name.

====''Tokyo Jiayin Magazine''====
In early 1914, Chen went to Japan, where he worked as an editor and writer in the ''Tokyo [[Jiayin Magazine]]'', which was published by [[Zhang Shizhao]]. Chen once wrote an article entitled "Self Consciousness on Patriotism" (爱国心与自觉/愛國心與自覺) which conveyed a strong sense of patriotism and encouraged people to fight for their freedom. It promoted the idea that those who love their country should spare no pains to protect it, and should fight for the rights of its citizens. This group of people should work together towards the same goal [[:wikt:harmony|harmonious]]ly. The article was threatening to Yuan Shikai's government, as it tried to arouse the self-consciousness of the Chinese people. This preliminary magazine was released for 10 issues in total, before it was prevented from publishing. The magazine was resumed in 1925 in Beijing with the new name ''[[Tokyo Jiayin Weekly]]''.

====''New Youth'' magazine====
In 1915, Chen started an influential monthly periodical in the [[French Concession]] of Shanghai, ''The Youth Magazine'' (青年杂志/青年雜誌), which was later renamed ''[[New Youth (Xin Qingnian)]]'' (新青年, literally ''New Youth''). It became one of the most influential magazines among the students who participated in the [[May Fourth Movement]]. Chen was the chief editor of this periodical. It was published by [[Qunyi shushe]], and ended publication in 1926. The magazine mainly advocated the use of [[vernacular language]], socialism, and Marxism, and was strongly against [[feudalism]].

In 1917, Chen became a lecturer of [[Chinese Literature]], and a Dean of [[Peking University]]. Having the approval from the [[Cai Yuanpei]], the Chancellor of the [[Peking University]], Chen collected the writings of the students which he appreciated most, which especially included [[Li Dazhao]], [[Hu Shih]], [[Lu Xun]] and [[Qian Yuan]]. In order to expand the editorial department, ''New Youth'' was moved to Beijing at this time, and in February 1917, Chen used ''New Youth'' to promote science, democracy and modern literature, and to discourage the study of [[paleography]] and classical Chinese literature. The magazine began to advocate the use of the [[scientific method]] and [[Logical argument]]s towards the achievement of political, economic, [[Social issues|social]], ethical, and democratic goals.

''New Youth'' focused on different concerns during various phases of its development. From 1915 to 1918 it opposed Chinese conservatism (especially conservatism associated with Confucianism) and promoted the development of democracy. During this phase, it became influential among the [[New Culture Movement]]. From 1919 to 1921, until the formation of the Chinese Communist Party, it focused on promoting socialism, and Marxism. From 1921 to 1926, it published and disseminated the prevailing views of the members of the Communist Party.

====Minor publications====

The Shanghai local government banned the sale of a publication called "''Guomin Ribao''" (国民日报/國民日報) on December 1, 1903. After this, Chen twice planned to found a paper called "''[[Aiguo Xinbao]]''"  but failed because of pressure from different groups. Chen continued to express his discontent towards the government in his later publications. When ''Anhui Suhua Bao''  was published on March 31, 1904, Chen was responsible for all editing and distribution.

On November 27, 1918, Chen started another magazine, the ''[[Weekly Review]]'' (每周评论/每週評論) with [[Li Dazhao]] in order to criticize the politics of his time in a more direct way and to promote democracy, science, and modern literature. Chen also edited ''Tokyo Jiayin Magazine'' (甲寅杂志/甲寅雜誌) and ''Science Magazine'' (科学杂志/科學雜誌). Later, he became the Editor-in-Chief of the newspapers ''Minli Bao'' (民立报/民立報) and ''Shenzhou Daily'' (神州日报/神州日報).

From 1908 to 1910, two students at Peking University, [[Deng Zhongxia]] and [[Xu Deheng]], founded the [[Guomin magazine|''Guomin'' magazine]]  and invited [[Li Dazhao]]  to be a consultant for the magazine. From 1912 to 1913, Chen, with the assistance of [[Luo Jialun]] and [[Fu Sinian]], published a paper named ''[[Xinchao She]]''.

====Chen's contribution to Chinese journalism====
Chen set a precedent for future writers via the intentionally controversial nature of his publications. He insisted on telling the truth to the Chinese people and strengthening the Chinese media for later generations. By publishing newspapers and magazines concerning political issues, Chen provided a channel for the general public to express their ideas or discontent towards the existing government. Chen believed that the purpose of mass media was to reveal the truth. At a young age, Chen had already established his first periodical, [[Guomin Ribao]], in which he criticized many social and political problems evident in the late Qing Dynasty. With a view to the things mentioned above, his contribution was said to be influential to journalism as a whole. Chen's writing brought the standards of [[Chinese journalism]] closer to those of other, more [[liberalism|liberal]] societies of his time.

===Poetry===
In 1918, ''New Youth'' published contemporary poetry by [[Hu Shih]] and [[Liu Bannong]], written in [[vernacular Chinese]], becoming one of the first publications in China to encourage poetry in vernacular Chinese. Eventually, every article in ''New Youth'' was written in vernacular Chinese. ''New Youth'' was one of the first publications in China to adopt and use punctuations marks, and popularized their use through its popularity and wide readership.

===Final letters and articles===
Gregor Benton compiled and translated into English the last of Chen Duxiu's writings, publishing them under the title "Chen Duxiu's last articles and letters, 1937-1942".{{sfn|Benton|1998}}

==Intellectual contributions and disputes==

===Crisis with Cai Yuanpei===
In the second edition of ''New Youth,'' Chen prepared to publish [[Cai Yuanpei]]'s speech, the "[[Speech on Freedom of Religion]]" (蔡元培先生在信教自由会之演说/蔡元培先生在信教自由會之演說), along with an editorial interpreting its meaning and significance. Before its appearance in ''New Youth'', Cai criticized Chen for misinterpreting this speech. Chen later admitted that "the publication of my speech in ''[[New Youth]]'' included a number of mistakes." Fortunately, Cai did not become angry with Chen and the publication was then amended before publishing.

===Crisis with Hu Shih===

This crisis was about the political stand of ''[[New Youth]]''. [[Hu Shih]] insisted that ''[[New Youth]]'' should be politically neutral and the publication should be concerned with [[Chinese philosophy]]. Chen attacked his rationale by publishing "Talking Politics" (谈政治/談政治) in the 8th edition. Because Chen was invited by [[Chen Jiongming]] to be the [[Education officer]] in Guangzhou in mid-December 1920, he decided to assign the publication to [[Mao Dun]], who belonged to the [[Shanghai Communist Party]].

Hu Shih was dissatisfied with this responsibility and their friendship and professional relationship ended. Later, Chen wrote to Hu Shih about his dissatisfaction with Hu's intimacy with many conservative faculty members of Peking University. Especially troubling to Chen was Hu's relationship with [[Liang Qichao]], a supporter of the [[Duan Qirui]] government and their anti-new wave ideology, which made Chen greatly dissatisfied.

===Views towards Confucianism and traditional values===
Chen suggested six guiding principles in ''New Youth'' with an article called "Warning the youth" (敬告青年). This article was aimed at removing the old beliefs of Confucianism. "Warning the Youth" promoted six values:

#Independence instead of servility;
#Progressivism instead of conservatism;
#Aggression instead of passivity;
#Cosmopolitanism instead of isolationism;
#Utilitarian beliefs instead of impractical traditions;
#Scientific knowledge instead of visionary insight.

''[[New Youth]]'' was one of the most influential magazines in early modern Chinese history. Chen introduced many new ideas into popular Chinese culture, including [[individualism]], [[democracy]], [[humanism]], and the use of the [[scientific method]], and he advocated the abandonment of [[Confucianism]] for the adoption [[Communism]].

Seen in this light, ''New Youth'' found itself in a position to provide an alternative intellectual influence for many young people. Under the banners of democracy and science, traditional Confucian ethics became the target of attack from ''[[New Youth]]''. In its first issue, Chen called for young generation to struggle against Confucianism by "theories of literary revolution" (文学革命论/文學革命論).

To Chen, [[Confucianism]] was to be rooted out because:

#It advocated superfluous ceremonies and preached the morality of meek compliance, making the Chinese people weak and passive, unfit to struggle and compete in the modern world.
#It promoted family values and rejected the idea that the individual was the basic unit of society.
#It upheld the inequality of the status of individuals.
#It stressed filial piety, which made men subservient and dependent.
#It preached orthodoxy of thought, disregarding freedom of thinking and expression.

Chen called for the destruction of tradition, and his attacks on traditionalism gave new options to the youth of his time. New Youth was a major influence within the [[May Fourth Movement]].

The '''Committee of 100''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[anti-war]] group. It was set up in 1960 with a hundred public signatories by [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ralph Schoenman]]&lt;ref name=ringsleben&gt;[https://archive.is/20121223213037/http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/maryringsleben.html Papers of Mary Ringsleben]&lt;/ref&gt; and Reverend [[Michael Scott (Reverend)|Michael Scott]] and others.  Its supporters used mass [[nonviolent]] resistance and [[civil disobedience]] to achieve their aims.

==History==

The idea of a mass civil disobedience campaign [[anti-nuclear|against nuclear weapons]] emerged early in 1960 in discussions between Ralph Schoenman (an activist in the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND)),  and [[Hugh Brock]], [[April Carter]] (both of the [[Direct Action Committee]] against nuclear war), [[Ralph Miliband]], Alan Lovell and [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]. Schoenman approached Bertrand Russell, the president of CND, with the idea.&lt;ref name=carroll&gt;Carroll, S.J., [http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/6910/1/Carroll%2C_Samantha_Jane.pdf ''Fill the Jails: Identity, Structure and Method in the Committee of 100, 1960 – 1968''], University of Sussex, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell resigned from the presidency of CND in order to form the Committee of 100, which was launched at a meeting in London on 22 October 1960 with a hundred signatures.  Russell was elected as president&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt; and [[Michael Randle]] of the Direct Action Committee was appointed secretary.

Russell explained his reasons for setting up&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.lse.ac.uk/library/archive/online_resources/cnd/cnd_1.aspx LSE.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108135211/http://www2.lse.ac.uk/library/archive/online_resources/cnd/cnd_1.aspx |date=2011-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Committee of 100 in an article in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' in February 1961:

{{quote|The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament has done and is doing valuable and very successful work to make known the facts, but the press is becoming used to its doings and beginning to doubt their news value.  It has therefore seemed to some of us necessary to supplement its campaign by such actions as the press is sure to report.  There is another, and perhaps more important reason for the practice of civil disobedience in this time of utmost peril.  There is a very widespread feeling that however bad their policies may be, there is nothing that private people can do about it.  This is a complete mistake.  If all those who disapprove of government policy were to join massive demonstrations of civil disobedience they could render government folly impossible and compel the so-called statesmen to acquiesce in measures that would make human survival possible.  Such a vast movement, inspired by outraged public opinion is possible, perhaps it is imminent.  If you join it you will be doing something important to preserve your family, compatriots and the world.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, B., "Civil Disobedience", ''New Statesman'', 17 February 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, including some of its founders, supported the Committee of 100's campaign of civil disobedience and in its first year it received more in donations than CND had received in its first year.&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt; Several of the early CND's activists, including some members of its executive committee, had been supporters of the Direct Action Committee and in 1958 CND had cautiously accepted direct action as a possible method of campaigning;&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt; but, largely under the influence of [[Canon John Collins]], the CND chairman, the CND leadership opposed any sort of unlawful protest, and the Committee of 100 was created as a separate organisation partly for that reason and partly because of personal animosity between Collins and Russell.  It has been suggested&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; that this separation weakened the campaign against nuclear weapons.

The Committee's campaign tactic was to organise sit-down demonstrations, which were not to be undertaken without at least 2,000 volunteers pledging to take part.&lt;ref name=ringsleben/&gt;  Many eminent people participated in the sit-downs but few of the 100 signatories took part in the Committee's activities.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Demonstrators were required to adopt a discipline of non-violence. In a briefing document the Committee of 100 said, "We ask you not to shout slogans and to avoid provocation of any sort.  The demonstrations must be carried out in a quiet, orderly way.  Although we want massive support for these demonstrations, we ask you to come only if you are willing to accept this non-violent discipline."&lt;ref name=leaflet&gt;''Mass Resistance - Wethersfield - Ruislip'', Committee of 100, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;  Demonstrators were recommended to remain limp if arrested and to refuse to co-operate in any way until inside the police station.

At first, the Committee of 100 differed from CND only in its methods, and they had the same objectives.  Within the Committee, however, there were different ideas about civil disobedience, direct action and non-violence. Bertrand Russell saw mass civil disobedience merely as a way of getting publicity for the unilateralist cause. Those from the Direct Action Committee were absolute pacifists (some of them Christians)&lt;ref name=shelley/&gt; who followed [[Gandhi]], and they regarded direct action as a way of creating a non-violent society. Ralph Schoenman and others, including the [[anarchism|anarchists]] who later led the organisation,&lt;ref name=shelley/&gt; saw direct action as a sort of insurrection that could force the state to give up nuclear weapons. These factions argued among themselves about whether non-violence was a matter of principle or just a tactic&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; and whether the Committee should limit itself to demonstrations or adopt a more thoroughgoing anarchist programme.&lt;ref name=shelley/&gt; [[Nicolas Walter]], a prominent member of the Committee, said later that it had been an anarchist organisation from its inception and that the hundred signatories were, in effect, a front.&lt;ref&gt;Walter, Nicolas, ''Damned Fools in Utopia'', PM Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1961===

The Committee's first act of civil disobedience on 18 February 1961 was a sit-down demonstration at the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in Whitehall, London, to coincide with the expected arrival of {{USS|Proteus|AS-19|6}} on the [[River Clyde]].&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt; ([https://web.archive.org/web/20081012030105/http://www.topfoto.co.uk/gallery/CND/ppages/ppage66.html Picture]) Between 1,000 and 6,000 people took part.&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt;&lt;ref name=fromprotest&gt;''From Protest to Resistance'', a ''Peace News'' pamphlet, Mushroom Books, Nottingham, 1981, p.18 {{ISBN|0-907123-02-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   Somewhat to the surprise of the Committee, there were no arrests.&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt;  At the next sit-down demonstration, on 29 April in Parliament Square, the police arrested 826 people.&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt;  There were also marches and sit-downs against nuclear testing and demonstrations at the [[Embassy of the United States in London|US]] and Soviet embassies in London and at the [[Polaris missile|Polaris]] [[submarine base]].&lt;ref name=fromprotest/&gt;

On 17 September, [[Battle of Britain]] Day, supporters blocked the pierheads at [[Holy Loch]] and the approaches to [[Trafalgar Square]]. ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110929195234/http://www.topfoto.co.uk/gallery/CND/ppages/ppage95.html Picture])  The September demonstration is regarded as the high-water mark of the Committee of 100.&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;  A week before the demonstration, the hundred committee members were summoned to court without charge under the Justices of the Peace Act of 1361&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Edw3/34/1 Justices of the Peace Act, 1361.&lt;/ref&gt; because they "incited members of the public to commit [[breach of the peace|breaches of the peace]]" and were likely to continue to do so. The court bound them to a promise of good behaviour for twelve months; thirty-two, including Bertrand Russell, then aged 89, refused and chose to go to prison instead. It is estimated that 12,000 to 15,000 attended the demonstration despite the invocation of the Public Order Act, which effectively made it illegal to be in the vicinity of central London that day. Several thousand sat down&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt;&lt;ref name=shelley/&gt; and there were 1,314 arrests, but no violence from demonstrators despite allegations of police brutality.&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt;

The success of the September demonstration encouraged the Committee to move from symbolic sit-down demonstrations in London to mass direct action at the places where nuclear weapons would be deployed, and they planned simultaneous demonstrations on 9 December to walk on to air force bases at [[RAF Wethersfield|Wethersfield]], [[RAF Northolt|Ruislip]], [[RAF Brize Norton|Brize Norton]], [[RAF Cardiff|Cardiff]]&lt;ref name=fromprotest/&gt; to sit on the runways and to prevent planes from taking off, and street sit-downs in [[Bristol]], [[Manchester]] and [[York]].&lt;ref name=leaflet/&gt;&lt;ref name=shelley&gt;Shelley, Diana, "Influx or exodus? Anarchists and the Committee of 100", ''Anarchy'', No. 50, April 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;  By this time the authorities had begun to take the Committee of 100 more seriously.  The official response had escalated from prosecution for incitement to breach of the peace to prosecution for the much more serious offences of conspiracy and incitement to breach the Official Secrets Act. Six organisers, the "Wethersfield Six",  were charged with these offences and five later imprisoned for eighteen months: [[Ian Dixon]], [[Terry Chandler]], [[Trevor Hatton]], Michael Randle, [[Pat Pottle]]; and the sixth, [[Helen Allegranza]], to twelve months.&lt;ref name=Driver&gt;Driver, Christopher, ''The Disarmers: A Study in Protest'', London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor, R., ''Against the Bomb'', Oxford University Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080706031129/http://www.topfoto.co.uk/gallery/CND/ppages/ppage52.html Picture]) Bertrand Russell said that he was equally responsible, but the authorities ignored him and concentrated on the six young, unknown Committee of 100 officers.&lt;ref name=fused&gt;[http://digitalcollections.mcmaster.ca/case-study/fused-fizzing-and-ready-go-bertrand-russell-takes-streets ''Fused, Fizzing and Ready to Go Off''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706185301/http://digitalcollections.mcmaster.ca/case-study/fused-fizzing-and-ready-go-bertrand-russell-takes-streets |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chandler&gt;[https://archive.is/20130420072301/http://www.britishcaselaw.co.uk/chandler-terence-norman-v-dpp-no-1-1962-ukhl-2-12-july-1962 Chandler (Terence Norman) v DPP (No 1).]&lt;/ref&gt; 3,000 military and civilian police were mobilised at Wethersfield.  5,000 demonstrated there and 850 were arrested.&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt;  The Wethersfield demonstration was regarded by many as a failure&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt;&lt;ref name=shelley/&gt;&lt;ref name=peers/&gt; and it was the Committee's last act of large-scale civil disobedience. There were recriminations within the Committee,&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt; one internal memorandum saying that its policies had turned it into "a public spectacle, a group isolated from the general body of public opinion and feeling."&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt;  [[Herbert Read]] resigned from the Committee, saying that the action was "strategically foolish".&lt;ref name=shelley/&gt;  The Committee was weakened by the imprisonment of its officers.

The force used by the police at sit-down demonstrations surprised many of the demonstrators, which, with the Committee's insistence on nonviolence and the use of pre-emptive arrests for conspiracy, discouraged many, and support dwindled.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, F.E., "Civil Disobedience and Organizational Change: The British Committee of 100", ''Political Science Quarterly,'' Vol. 86, No. 1. (March 1971), pp. 92-112.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee's plan to "fill the jails" by means of mass civil disobedience, and thus compel the government to respond to their demands, was frustrated by the authorities imprisoning a few important members and ignoring the rest.&lt;ref name=carroll/&gt; The harsh sentences on the Wethersfield Six "brought home to the Committee its inadequacy when faced with the might of the State,"&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; and some of the Committee's leaders were not willing to "fill the jails", mounting strenuous appeals against conviction&lt;ref name=chandler/&gt; or, in the case of Pat Pottle, going on the run.&lt;ref name=shelley/&gt;&lt;ref name=fromprotest/&gt;

===1962–1968===

By 1962, half of the original 100 signatories had resigned and had been replaced.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;  The Committee was in debt&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt; and had to face the failure of its mass civil-disobedience campaign.&lt;ref name=peers/&gt;  It was dissolved and the campaign was decentralized,&lt;ref name=ringsleben/&gt; thirteen regional committees, each with a hundred members, becoming responsible for organizing demonstrations, with a co-ordinating National Committee. Of the regional committees, the London Committee of 100 was the most active and influential.  A national magazine was launched by the London Committee in April 1963, published under the name ''Resistance'' from January 1964. Like CND, the Committee of 100 had begun with a self-appointed and unelected leadership, and, like CND, it faced pressure for greater participation by supporters.  This re-organisation was intended to involve more people in decision making and to spread demonstrations throughout the country&lt;ref name=carroll/&gt; and had been anticipated in the creation of a number of subgroups in December 1961.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Although Bertrand Russell opposed it,&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; he wrote that "The Committee has found that its support, named and on file, is so extensive that regional committees are required to accommodate this strength,"&lt;ref&gt;Russell, B. ''Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell'', Open Court, Chicago and La Salle, 2001, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; But supporters became exhausted by the number of demonstrations they attended&lt;ref name=carroll/&gt;&lt;ref name=shelley/&gt; and "neither London nor the regional committees had their full complement of a hundred."&lt;ref name=shelley/&gt;

In March 1962 Russell addressed a sit-down demonstration in Parliament Square against the sentences on the Wethersfield Six. All the 1,172 protesters were arrested, but there was a growing feeling that such demonstrations were becoming an end in themselves&lt;ref&gt;London Committee of 100, ''Beyond Counting Arses'', 1963.  Cited in Gopodway, David ''[[Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow]]'', Liverpool University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and would not now create a mass movement against nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; (Contemporary research showed that public support for the unilateralist cause actually declined in the period when the Committee of 100 was most active.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, W.P., ''The Politics of British Defense Policy, 1945-1962,'' Ohio University Press, 1964, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;) A sit-down of 7,000 outside the Air Ministry planned for the following September had to be called off because of lack of support,&lt;ref name=fused/&gt;&lt;ref name=peers&gt;Peers, Dave, [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/1963/no012/peers.htm "The impasse of CND"], ''International Socialism'', ''International Socialism'', No. 12, Spring 1963, pp. 6–11.&lt;/ref&gt; a "public assembly" being held instead.&lt;ref name=fromprotest/&gt;

To underline its opposition to Russian nuclear weapons as well as those of the West, the Committee held a demonstration in [[Red Square]], [[Moscow]], at an international congress of the [[World Peace Council]] in the summer of 1962 calling for the abolition of all nuclear weapons and attacking the Soviet system.&lt;ref name=driver&gt;Christopher Driver, ''The Disarmers'', London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Sectariana/SFReply.html Review: Solidarity Forever.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 12 July 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1962 onwards, the Committee became increasingly radical and extended its campaigns to issues other than nuclear weapons.  [[Peter Cadogan]], an officer of the Committee, said it was "trying to go in 12 directions at once", including campaigning for civil liberties in [[Greece]], against [[Harold Wilson]]'s failure to produce a promised [[Vietnam War|Vietnam peace initiative]] and against siting [[London Stansted Airport|London's third airport]] at Stansted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1571755/Peter-Cadogan.html Obituary of Peter Cadogan.]&lt;/ref&gt; Diana Shelley, a member of the London Committee of 100, said that as the Committee adopted objectives other than nuclear disarmament it became "less non-violent".&lt;ref name=shelley/&gt;  In 1963 Russell resigned, though he remained in sympathy with the early aims and activities of the Committee and was careful not to denigrate it publicly.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;  Following his departure, the public image of the Committee deteriorated, many signatories also resigned and "the Committee of 100 ventured even further into the wilderness of libertarian politics".&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;

Members of the Committee were responsible for the [[Spies for Peace]]&lt;ref&gt;Camley, N., ''Cold War Secret Bunkers'', Pen &amp; Sword Books, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; revelations in 1963 about the [[Regional Seat of Government|Regional Seats of Government]], a network of secret government bunkers, and later for the escape of [[George Blake]]&lt;ref&gt;Pottle, P., and Randle M., ''The Blake Escape'', Sphere Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs Prison]].

The Committee's interest in Greek politics was sparked by the banning of a march by the Greek "Bertrand Russell Committee of 100" in Easter 1963, by the expulsion of some of the British Committee of 100's members when they attempted to join the march, and by the murder of [[Grigoris Lambrakis]], a Greek MP and peace activist.&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt;  Plans to protest against the London visit by [[Paul of Greece|King Paul]] and [[Frederika of Hanover|Queen Frederika]] in July 1963 were met by official attempts to prevent the demonstrations&lt;ref name=ewing/&gt; and draconian prison sentences on demonstrators. The government was criticized in the press for the severity of its treatment of the demonstrators and eventually there were embarrassing climb-downs.  Some of the sentences were overturned on appeal and the Home Secretary, [[Henry Brooke, Baron Brooke of Cumnor|Henry Brooke]], had to offer financial compensation.  One of the demonstrators, [[Donald Rooum]], proved that an offensive weapon had been planted on him and forced a public inquiry that criticized the police and led to the eventual imprisonment of three officers.&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt;  But a nine-months sentence on Terry Chandler, secretary of the London Committee, was upheld on appeal.&lt;ref name=ewing&gt;Ewing, K.

Ewing and Adam Tomkins (eds), ''The Legal Protection of Human Rights'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Diana Shelley said that the imprisonment of Chandler, "the force which had driven" the Committee throughout the summer,&lt;ref name=shelley/&gt; had a profoundly damaging effect. Four years after these events, following the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|1967 military coup]] in Greece, a "non-violent invasion" of the Greek embassy resulted in prison sentences of up to fifteen months for Committee of 100 demonstrators.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;

The Committee of 100 was wound up in October 1968.

==Name==
According to Christopher Driver, the name was suggested by [[Gustav Metzger]] and Ralph Schoenman, who derived it from the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] Council of 100.&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt;

==Legacy==
Before the Committee of 100 came on the scene, civil disobedience on this scale was virtually unknown in Britain, although the researches of its advocates uncovered it as a strand of protest throughout the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Cadogan, Peter, "Non-violence as a reading of history", ''Anarchy'', No. 20, October 1962, London, Freedom Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Committee of 100, and comparable movements outside the UK (not least the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the United States), made it a common method of social action, now familiar in environmental, animal rights and peace protests. However, the Committee's strict insistence on nonviolence is rare.  The Committee also popularized a new method of organization derived from anarchism and hitherto unfamiliar to those in traditional political parties: without formal membership and based on decentralization and autonomous, self-selected "working groups" rather than elected executive committees.&lt;ref name=shelley/&gt;&lt;ref name=peers/&gt;

'''Common-interest development''' ('''CID''') is the fastest growing form of housing in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Living in a California Common Interest Development| publisher=State of California Department of Real Estate| url=http://www.dre.cahwnet.gov/pub_re39.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Evan| last= McKenzie| title=Privatopia: Homeowner Associations and the Rise of Residential Private Governments| publisher= Yale University Press| isbn= 0-300-06638-4| pages= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are commonly known as [[condominium]]s, [[timeshare]]s, and [[planned development]]s. The ownership benefits of a CID are having rights to an undivided interest in common areas and amenities which might prove to be too expensive to be solely owned. For example, an owner would like to have a pool but cannot afford one. When buying a [[condominium]] with a pool in a CID of one hundred units, an owner would have use of that pool for basically one-hundredth the cost due to sharing the cost with the other 99 owners. [[Timeshare]], or vacation ownership, is the same concept. Where buying a second home for vacation purposes might not be financially possible, buying a week or two can be when sharing the overall costs with other participants.

Within the United States, when a CID is developed, the developer is required to incorporate (in form) a [[homeowner association]] (HOA) prior to any property sales. The role of the HOA is to manage the CID once control is transferred from the developer. The HOA governs the CID based upon the incorporated [[restrictive covenant|covenants, conditions, and restrictions]] (CC&amp;Rs) which were recorded when the property was subdivided. The CC&amp;Rs will outline the financial [[budgeting]] guideline for the HOA in determining the dollar amount in maintenance fees for assessing the owners. In a wholly owned CID, maintenance fees would normally be assessed on a monthly basis.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The '''Comptroller and Auditor General''' ('''C&amp;AG''') ({{lang-ga|An tArd-Reachtaire Cuntas agus Ciste}}) is the constitutional officer responsible for public audit in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is the public audit body for the Republic of Ireland and is headed by the C&amp;AG.

The Comptroller and Auditor General is ex-officio member of the [[Standards in Public Office Commission]] and of the [[Referendum Commission]].

The C&amp;AG is a member of the [[International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions]].

The current Comptroller and Auditor-General is [[Seamus McCarthy]] (since 28 May 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audgen.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/aboutus/Biography_EN.htm |title=Biography of Comptroller and Auditor General|publisher=Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional officer and independence==
The office of Comptroller and Auditor General was established under Article 33 of the [[Constitution of Ireland]].  The C&amp;AG is appointed by the [[President of Ireland|President]] on the nomination of [[Dáil Éireann]]. The office has its  origins in Article 62 of the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] of 1922 as implemented by the '''Comptroller and Auditor-General Act 1923''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1923/en/act/pub/0001/index.html |title=Comptroller and Auditor-General Act 1923 |publisher=Office of the Attorney General |date=1923 |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provided that the Comptroller and Auditor-General ({{lang-ga|Árd-Scrúdóir}}) (as the office was then known) was to be appointed by [[Dáil Éireann]]. The 1923 Act and the '''Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0008/index.html |title=Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 |publisher=Office of the Attorney General |date=1993 |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the two principal legislative instruments governing the C&amp;AG.  Both the Constitutional and legislative provisions ensure the absolute independence of the C&amp;AG and the Office of the C&amp;AG to operate independently of government. The C&amp;AG makes reports to [[Dáil Éireann]] on the accounts of bodies falling within its remit, essentially the State or State bodies and certain specified agencies or bodies receiving State funds.  The reports are examined in detail by the [[Public Accounts Committee (Ireland)|Dáil Committee of Public Accounts]] ({{lang-ga|An Coiste um Chuntais Phoiblí}}).&lt;ref&gt;For the terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts see Appendix 1 to {{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/committees/pac/reports2014/2014-Composite-report.pdf |title=Composite Report of the Public Accounts Committee 2014 | date=October 2014 |publisher=Houses of the Oireachtas |location=Dublin |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The Comptroller and Auditor General audits and reports on the use of public funds.  It establishes that they are legal and used appropriately.  It also examines the internal audit systems of public bodies and applies tests for value for money and effectiveness.

The bodies to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General are laid down by law.  The Comptroller and Auditor General may receive new audit mandates from time to time regarding specific State bodies.  It may lose its functions when bodies are dissolved, merged or rationalised.

The C&amp;AG may not audit all recipients of State funding but only where audits of the recipient bodies are permitted or required by law.  As a result, some bodies which receive a large amount of State funding or even are reliant on it, may not be subject to audit by the C&amp;AG.  This also has consequences for the remit of the Dáil [[Public Accounts Committee (Ireland)|Dáil Committee of Public Accounts]].

===Annual Reports on the Accounts of the Public Service===
The C&amp;AG makes an Annual Report under the heading "Accounts of the Public Services" on funding granted by the [[Oireachtas]].  This includes the accounts of 41 Government Departments and offices, including the establishment of the [[President of Ireland]], as well as bodies such as the [[Garda Síochána]], prisons service, and the secret service.  It publishes the relevant annual Appropriation Accounts together with the Annual Reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audgen.gov.ie/documents/annualreports/2013/report/en/Report2013.pdf |title=Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2013 | date=2014 |publisher=Comptroller and Auditor General |location=Dublin |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health Sector===
The C&amp;AG is responsible for auditing institutions in the health sector such as the Health Service Executive (HSE) and all Regional Health Boards.  It also audits specified hospitals, and a variety of health-related State agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audgen.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=1579&amp;CatID=34&amp;StartDate=1+January+2015|title=Health Sector |publisher=Comptroller and Auditor General |location=Dublin |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It does not audit privately owned hospitals even though they may be in receipt of, or even reliant on, public funds.

If the C&amp;AG considers problematic issues arise in relation to a Regional Health Board which merit a public accountability, it may issue what is known as a Section 6 Report, authorised by Section 6 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audgen.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=-1&amp;CatID=24&amp;UserLang=EN&amp;m=6|title=Section 6 Reports|publisher=Comptroller and Auditor General |location=Dublin |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational Sector===
In the education sector, the C&amp;AG audits all Irish Universities, Institutes of Technology and other specified third-level educational institutions such as the [[National College of Art and Design]].  It audits all Vocational Educational Committees.  It also audits specified State bodies related to education such as the Higher Education Authority and the [[Royal Irish Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audgen.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=-1&amp;CatID=34&amp;UserLang=EN&amp;m=34 |title=Audited Bodies|publisher=Comptroller and Auditor General |location=Dublin |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the C&amp;AG considers problematic issues arise in relation to a Vocational Education Committee which merit a public accountability, it may issue what is known as a Section 7 Report, authorized by Section 7 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audgen.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=-1&amp;CatID=25&amp;UserLang=EN&amp;m=6 |title=Section 7 reports|publisher=Comptroller and Auditor General |location=Dublin |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial Sector===
The Comptroller and Auditor General audits 25 State bodies in the financial sector including the [[National Treasury Management Agency]] ([[NTMA]]) and the [[National Asset Management Agency]] (NAMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audgen.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=1584&amp;CatID=34&amp;StartDate=1+January+2015 |title=Financial Sector|publisher=Comptroller and Auditor General |location=Dublin |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Audited Bodies===
The Comptroller and Auditor General audits a very wide variety (115 in 2012) of State bodies or agencies as diverse as the [[National Library of Ireland]], the [[Road Safety Authority]] and the [[Abbey Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audgen.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=1585&amp;CatID=34&amp;StartDate=1+January+2015 |title=Accounts Audited|publisher=Comptroller and Auditor General |location=Dublin |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It audits all 35 County Enterprise Boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audgen.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=1587&amp;CatID=34&amp;StartDate=1+January+2015 |title=Country Enterprise Boards|publisher=Comptroller and Auditor General |location=Dublin |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North/South Bodies===
The Comptroller and Auditor General carries out audits of the annual accounts of designated North/South public bodies with cross-border functions or activities relating to both the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]].  These reports are prepared jointly with the [[Comptroller and Auditor General for Northern Ireland]].

Where it is considered that an issue of public accountability arises, a report is drawn up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audgen.gov.ie/documents/specialreports/north_south/Accountability_of_North_South_Bodies_1999-2007.pdf |title=Accountability of North South Bodies 1999-2007|publisher=Comptroller and Auditor General|date=2 July 2008 |location=Dublin |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An interesting example of cross-border cooperation between the two Comptrollers and Auditors General is seen in the Bytel cross-border broadband project where the Northern Ireland Audit Office and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of Ireland made a coordinated examination of the Bytel project.  Although the two Comptrollers and Auditors General issued separate reports, they were issued simultaneously on 3 March 2015 and the report of each Comptroller and Auditor General was annexed to the report of the other.  This coordinated examination was the first time this approach has been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audgen.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=2074&amp;CatID=17&amp;StartDate=1+January+2015 |title=Press Release by the Comptroller and Auditor General of Ireland |publisher=Comptroller and Auditor General|date=3 March 2015 |location=Dublin |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niauditoffice.gov.uk/index/publications/recent_reports/bytel_media_release_25_feb_15.pdf |title=Press Release by the Northern Ireland Audit Office |publisher=Comptroller and Auditor General of Northern Ireland|date=3 March 2015 |location=Belfast |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value for Money Reports===
The Office publishes special reports on Value for Money according to orthodox value for money criteria (efficiency, economy, effectiveness evaluation systems, procedures, practices) used by public audit bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audgen.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=-1&amp;CatID=5&amp;UserLang=EN&amp;m=13 |title=Value for Money Reports|publisher=Comptroller and Auditor General |location=Dublin |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Reports===
The C&amp;AG from time to time publishes Special Reports on specific or general issues arising from audits, inspections or examinations carried out by him or his Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audgen.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=-1&amp;CatID=4&amp;UserLang=EN&amp;m=13 |title=Special Reports|publisher=Comptroller and Auditor General |location=Dublin |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bodies not audited==
The C&amp;AG does not audit commercial semi-State bodies even when these are overwhelmingly owned by the State.  Examples include the ESB (Electricity Supply Board)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esb.ie/main/about-esb/ESB_Annual_Report_and_Accounts_2013.pdf?v=3 |title=ESB Annual Report 2013 | date=2013 |publisher=ESB |location=Dublin |accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or [[Bord na Móna]] (the Peat Board) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bordnamona.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Annual-Report-2014-English.pdf|title=Bord na Móna Annual Report 2014 | date=2014 |publisher=Bord na Móna |location=Dublin |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are 95% owned by the State. Likewise it does not audit the accounts of [[Irish Water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0006/print.html#part1 |title=Water Services Act 2013 |publisher=Office of the Attorney General |date=20 March 2013 |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corruption in [[Singapore]]''' is generally perceived as low. Cases are mostly handled by the Singapore [[Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau]] (CPIB), a government agency in Singapore that investigates and prosecutes corruption in the public and private sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chong|first1=Elena|title=Ex-police officer charged with warning dance clubs on raids|url=http://mypaper.sg/top-stories/ex-police-officer-charged-warning-dance-clubs-raids-20151204|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151206061833/http://mypaper.sg/top-stories/ex-police-officer-charged-warning-dance-clubs-raids-20151204|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 December 2015|accessdate=4 December 2015|publisher=my paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 6th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/cpi2015/|title=2015 Corruption Perceptions Index: Results|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest corruption risk area are identified by Government Defence Anti-Corruption Index as Operations followed by Finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore|url=http://government.defenceindex.org/countries/singapore/|website=Government Defence Anti-Corruption Index|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business executives surveyed in the [[World Economic Forum]]'s 2014–2015 [[Global Competitiveness Report]] reported no problems doing business in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014|url=http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2014-2015/economies/#indexId=GCI&amp;economy=SGP|publisher=The World Economic Forum|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political reasoning behind why Singaporean corruption is perceived as being low is due to the fact that compared to neighboring nations such as Thailand or Indonesia, there is a theory that the powers of the state were able to pressure private interests into funneling capital into sectors that would ultimately benefit the public in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doner|first=Richard F.|last2=Ritchie|first2=Bryan K.|last3=Slater|first3=Dan|date=April 2005|title=Systemic Vulnerability and the Origins of Developmental States: Northeast and Southeast Asia in Comparative Perspective|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/systemic-vulnerability-and-the-origins-of-developmental-states-northeast-and-southeast-asia-in-comparative-perspective/EBFBFEDDFEFC2384B2273DD95F186302|journal=International Organization|language=en|volume=59|issue=2|pages=327–361|doi=10.1017/S0020818305050113|issn=1531-5088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases of corruption==
===SLA (2011)===
Former [[Singapore Land Authority]] (SLA) deputy director of technology and infrastructure, Koh Seah Wee, and former SLA manager, Christopher Lim Chai Meng, were sentenced to jail by the High Court on cheating and money laundering charges. Koh was sentenced to 22 years of jail after admitting to 59 charges and Lim was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment after admitting to 49 charges. Of the $12.2 million laundered, $7.5 million was recovered from Koh. Koh and Lim cheated SLA by using false invoices issued by ex-swim coach Ho Yen Teck who set up seven sole proprietorships to provide fake IT maintenance services and goods that were not delivered. Ho was jailed for 10 years for the conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;https://sg.news.yahoo.com/two-former-sla-employees-plead-guilty-to-laundering--12-2-million.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===SCDF and CNB (2012)===
In January 2012, two senior civil servants were arrested under graft charges. Former head of the [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]] (SCDF), Peter Lim Sin Pang,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gallery: Corruption trial of ex-SCDF chief Peter Lim underway|url=http://www.todayonline.com/photos/gallery-corruption-trial-ex-scdf-chief-peter-lim-underway|accessdate=13 January 2015|publisher=MediaCorp Press Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was arrested on 19 December 2011, while [[Central Narcotics Bureau]] (CNB) chief, Ng Boon Gay, was taken in for questioning on 4 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/The-Big-Story/The-Big-Story-3/Story/STIStory_759501.html | title=CPIB: Top men were arrested, being probed for graft | author=Leonard Lim | publisher=Straits Times| date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both men were arrested in connection with the Prevention of Corruption Act relating to an IT contract,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20120128-324386.html| title=Woman in centre of CPIB probe leads double life | publisher=AsiaOne| date=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in late January 2012, it was announced that both men are also facing disciplinary action by the Public Service Commission, which oversees the conduct of civil servants. After being interdicted, a step only taken when an individual “faces serious offences for which 'criminal proceedings or proceedings for his dismissal or reduction in rank are being contemplated'”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/The-Big-Story/The-Big-Story-3/Story/STIStory_760299.html | title=CPIB probe: Duo facing civil service disciplinary proceedings as well | author=Toh Yong Chuan | publisher=Straits Times| date=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the case provoked comment from Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] who promised to punish both men if they are guilty of misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/The-Big-Story/The-Big-Story-3/Story/STIStory_759999.html

The CPIB’s silence on this investigation came under the scrutiny of a number of MPs during a parliamentary sitting in February 2012. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs, [[Teo Chee Hean]] then defended the CPIB, stating that any announcement on the outcome of the probe would have been premature and may have compromised the investigation. He also assured concerned MPs that all the findings of the investigation would be publicly reported once they had been finalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20120214-327884.html | title= Premature announcement would have compromised CPIB investigations: DPM Teo | author= AsiaOne | publisher= AsiaOne | date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Peter Lim Sin Pang was eventually dismissed from service formally in August 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-SCDF chief Peter Lim dismissed from service|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/ex-scdf-chief-peter-lim-dismissed-service|accessdate=13 January 2015|publisher=MediaCorp Press Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and found guilty while Ng Boon Gay retired&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-CNB chief Ng Boon Gay retired from public service: MHA|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/ex-cnb-chief-ng-boon-gay-retired-public-service-mha|accessdate=13 January 2015|publisher=MediaCorp Press Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being acquitted.

===NParks (2012)===
In July 2012, [[National Parks Board]]'s (NParks) purchase of 26 [[Brompton Bicycle|Brompton bikes]] costing $2,200 each sparked a nationwide uproar after it was revealed by a whistleblower on online forum [[HardwareZone]] of possible corruption due numerous red flags in the way the procurement was done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiaone.com/print/News/Latest%252BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20120802-362835.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029045642/http://www.asiaone.com/print/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20120802-362835.html |archivedate=2017-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khaw, who initially defended NPark's purchase of the high-end foldable bikes, was criticised for handling the saga poorly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mothership.sg/2013/10/hardwarezone-forum-broke-brompton-bike-fiasco/|title=How Hardwarezone Forum broke the Brompton bike fiasco|website=Mothership.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent investigation by the [[Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau]] resulted in National Parks Board assistant director Bernard Lim Yong Soon being fined $5,000 for lying to auditors about his relationship with the bicycle firm which was awarded the tender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/brompton-bikes-case-nparks-officer-fined-maximum-5000-for-lying-to-auditors|title=Brompton bikes case: NParks officer fined maximum $5,000 for lying to auditors|last=migration|date=2014-06-10|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2017-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CPIB (2013)===
On 23 July 2013, Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) assistant director Edwin Yeo Seow Hionh was charged with misappropriating at least $1.7 million from the anti-graft agency between 2008 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/cpib-officer-facing-21-charges-of-fraud-involving-at-least-17-million&lt;/ref&gt; Yeo was interdicted from his position as head of field research and technical support at CPIB to assist in a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) probe into his suspected financial impropriety. Eight of the charges were for misappropriating funds and [[Penal Code (Singapore)#Criminal breach of trust|criminal breach of trust]], one was for forgery and the rest were in using part of his ill-gotten gains to gamble at the [[Marina Bay Sands]] (MBS) casino.&lt;ref&gt;https://sg.news.yahoo.com/senior-cpib-officer-charged-with-embezzling-s-1-7-million-015009043.html&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 February 2014, Yeo was sentenced to 10 years jail.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/former-cpib-assistant-director-jailed-10-years-0&lt;/ref&gt;

===MFA (2014)===

On 20 February 2014, former Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) protocol chief Lim Cheng Hoe, 61, was sentenced to 15 months' jail for cheating. From February 2008 to May 2012, Lim made false claims for $89,000 worth of pineapple tarts and wine as gifts for foreign diplomats.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ex-mfa-protocol-chief-lim-cheng-hoe-sentenced-to-15-months-jail-for-cheating&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/former-mfa-protocol-chief-lim-cheng-hoe-pleads-guilty-10-counts-fraud&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ang Mo Kio Town Council (2016)===
General manager and secretary of [[Ang Mo Kio]] Town Council (AMKTC), Victor Wong Chee Meng, was removed from his position and placed under investigation by CPIB, after a complaint was lodged in September 2016 over "the way he handles contracts and dealings in the town council". Wong, a [[Pingat Bakti Masyarakat|Public Service Medal]] recipient, was concurrently an employee of [[CPG Corporation|CPG]] Facilities Management, which is the appointed managing agent of the town council.&lt;ref&gt;https://sg.news.yahoo.com/ang-mo-kio-town-council-general-manager-investigated-by-cpib-234748175.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/12/30/general-manager-of-pap-town-council-removed-from-duties-and-placed-under-cpib-investigations/&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 March 2018, Wong is charged with 55 counts of corruption offence for receiving some $107,000 in bribes from Chia Sin Lan and Yip Fong Yin, directors of two building and repair companies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2018/03/14/former-general-manager-of-ang-mo-kio-town-council-charged-in-court-for-alleged-corruption/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keppel Corporation (2017)===

According to US prosecutors, [[Keppel Corporation|Keppel]]’s offshore and marine arm, Keppel O&amp;M, agreed to pay a US$422 million settlement to avoid a criminal trial for bribing Brazilian officials.

[[File:White-tailed_deer.jpg|thumb|350px|Due to the deer's prevalence across different types of terrain, importance as a game animal and free and unrestricted nature the animal is a popular component of country symbolism.]]

'''Country''', as an [[Self-concept| identity]] or descriptive quality, is the state or character of being rural regardless of environment. It can be at direct odds with  quantitative measures of ruralness such as [[Rural area| those used by governments for statistical analysis]]. Country is [[Subjectivity| subjective]] and often [[intuitive]]. It encompasses a broad base of ideas and perceptions that may differ at local, regional or national levels. The term country can be used to refer to individuals both in singular and plural, while the term '''countryfolk''' is exclusively used collectively.

==Social development==
Identity has the tendency to be more localized within relatively isolated populations. Such populations, having distinct traditions of their own, can often be viewed as an [[Ingroups_and_outgroups| outgroup]] and marginalized by the dominant culture. Accordingly, contrast between rural and urban realities not only produces measurable differences politically and economically, but also affects populations in terms of social identification.&lt;ref name="knowingyourplace"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Country conceptualization shifts the focus away from the prevailing forces in society (usually centered in larger, metropolitan regions) and towards those on the periphery of society (remote areas and small towns). Consequently, this transition causes rural populations to feel less ignored, better connected with rural [[diaspora]] and significantly more empowered. By extension this transition highlights that rural culture is pervasive and does not necessarily depend on residing in a rural area. As a result country conceptualization  often assists in reversing the psychological consequences of frequent marginalization.
[[File:Town_mouse_country_mouse.png|left|{{largethumb}}|An illustration of [[The_Town_Mouse_and_the_Country_Mouse| "The Town Mouse and Country Mouse"]] of  ''Aesop's Fables'' an early parable of urban and rural equality/divide.]]
==Cognitive definitions== 
Country is a [[Subjectively| subjective state]] that perceives the [[rural area| rural]] [[experience]] as focal and inseparable to ones [[collective identity| identity]], regardless of location. This is often expressed in the [[social exclusion| demarginalization]] of ideas, values or lifestyles held as being representative of such a character. A concise understanding of Country as an overarching concept is difficult due to the tendency by observers to equate it with frequently  associated elements. As well, by individuals and groups denoting Country with classification that limits in such terms (IE "rural working-class culture" or "southern culture").  However it is perhaps best epitomized not in objective elements, as place, class or [[Natural environment|environment]], but rather in its subjective symbolism and by the perception that individuals can continue to retain a sense of ''ruralness'' even in urbanized areas. As there is no definitive, scholarly consensus on precisely what constitutes as Country, much of its discourse can be attributed to the artistic community who describe it in [[Romanticism| romanticized]] ways. In her master thesis, ''Manifestations of Collective Identity in Country Music - Cultural, Regional, National'', Stephanie Schäfer denotes that [[country music]] is important tool for reinforcing this collective identity.
&lt;ref name="schafer"&gt;{{ cite thesis | last=Schäfer | first=Stephanie | authorlink=  | ISBN=978-3-8428-2301-3 | publisher=Diplomica Verlag GmbH | title=Manifestations of Collective Identity in Country Music - Cultural, Regional, National | url= | year=2011 | degree=MA }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite Schäfer's analysis of country music as losing much of its "ground" in recent years through commercialization, even modern songs such as ''[[How Country Feels]]'' (Randy Houser), ''[[A Little More Country Than That]]'' (Easton Corbin), ''I'm Country'' (Craig Morgan), ''[[She's Country]]'' (Jason Aldean), etc. continue to, directly or indirectly, address the topic of Country conceptualization.  For example, Luke Bryan in ''[[Doin'_My_Thing| What Country Is]]'' illustrates Country by contrasting it with what it is not. He elaborates that:

{{quotation|"It [Country] ain't a jacked up truck that's never seen a pasture,

It's cars pulling over for a no cap tractor,

It's homemade peach ice cream on sun-burnt lips, 

No, it can't be bought it's somethin' you're born with, 

That's what country is."}}

This emphasis of non-material culture over material resonates with the rural experience as being represented through material elements rather than solely consisting of them.  Within the United States country frequently transcends a close relationship with the [[Culture of the Southern United States]] as a source of unity and empowerment of local, marginalized peoples who feel left out from the dominant culture. The preference to identify as country before more tradition means of classification, such as race or class, is reflected of [[self-determination theory]]. As human beings have an inherent drive to better their association with others they consistently try to do so more effectively. Country identification is one way in that an individual strives for this realization by identifying in ways that are more advantageous to rural populations and not necessarily in ways dictated by mainstream society.

'''Dmitry Vladimirovich Karakozov''' (''Дми́трий Влади́мирович Карако́зов'' in [[Russian language|Russian]]) (October 23 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|Old Style]] (November 4 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|New Style]]), 1840 &amp;ndash; September 3 Old Style (September 15 New Style), 1866) was the first [[Russia]]n [[revolutionary]] to make an attempt on the life of a [[tsar]]. The attempt to assassinate tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] failed and Karakozov was executed.

== Early life and studies ==
Karakozov was born in the family of a minor [[nobility]] in [[Kostroma]]. He grew to hate his class because all they did was "suck the peasants' blood." He studied at [[Kazan University]] 1861-64 and at [[Moscow State University]] 1864-66. He was expelled from both which led to depression and a suicide attempt. In early 1866 he became a member of the "revolutionary wing" of the [[Ishutin Society]], founded by his cousin [[Nikolai Ishutin]] in [[Moscow]] in 1863. 

==Attempted assassination of Alexander II==
In the spring of 1866, Karakozov arrived in [[St Petersburg]] to assassinate [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. He circulated his hand-written [[proclamation]] called ''"Друзьям-рабочим"'' ("To Friends-Workers"), in which he incited people to revolt. He wrote a manifesto to the St Petersburg governor blaming the Tsar for the suffering of the poor:
"I have decided to destroy the evil Tsar, and to die for my beloved people."&lt;ref&gt;Ana Siljak, ''Angel of Vengeance'', page 79&lt;!-- publishing info needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This note never reached anyone; it was lost in the mail.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Siljak, ''Angel of Vengeance'', page 110&lt;!-- publishing info needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible 1866 was the year chosen because of the character of Rakhmetov in [[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|''What Is to Be Done?'']]. This fictional inspiration of revolutionary youth plans for a revolution to coincide with the apocalypse according to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]-1866.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Siljak, ''Angel of Vengeance'', page 82&lt;!-- publishing info needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I have long been tormented by the thought and given no rest by my doubts why my beloved simple Russian people has to suffer so much! ... Why next to the eternal simple peasant and labourer in his factory and workshop are there people who do nothing – idle nobles, a horde of officials and other wealthy people, all living in shining houses? I have looked for the reason for all this in books, and I have found it. The man really responsible is the Tsar. ... the Tsar is the first of the nobles. He never holds out his hand to the people because he is himself the people's worst enemy.|Karakozov|manifesto addressed to "Friends-Workers" (found in Karakozov's pocket)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1866: Dmitry Karakozov|url=http://www.executedtoday.com/2012/09/15/1866-dmitry-karakozov/|work=ExecutedToday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hosking1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey A. Hosking|title=Russia: People and Empire, 1552-1917|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0plOWLcq3UC&amp;pg=PA347|year=1997|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-78118-4|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 4 April 1866, Dmitry Karakozov made an unsuccessful attempt on the life of Tsar Alexander II at the gates of the [[Summer Garden]] in St Petersburg. As the Tsar was leaving, Dmitry rushed forward to fire. The attempt was thwarted by Ossip Komissarov, a peasant-born hatter's apprentice, who jostled Karakozov's elbow just before the shot was fired.{{Ref|Komissarov}} Contemporary monarchists argued that Komissarov's action proved the people's love for their tsar, while contemporary radicals and later [[Soviet historians]] argued that Komissarov's involvement in the event was either an accident or an outright government fabrication. Komissarov was ennobled and given a generous allowance, but proved to be an embarrassment to the government due to his boorishness and incoherence and had to be politely removed to the countryside.{{Ref|Aftermath}}

Karakozov tried to flee instead of using the second cartridge in his double-barrelled gun, but was easily caught by the guards. He kept one hand in his jacket. It was revealed later to be holding [[morphine]] and [[strychnine]] to kill himself and [[prussic acid]] to disfigure his face. Alexander asked him "What do you want?" "Nothing, nothing," he replied.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Siljak, ''Angel of Vengeance'', page 79&lt;!-- publishing info needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Karakozov was taken to the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]].  He begged for forgiveness and converted to [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]]. The Supreme Criminal Court sentenced him to death by [[hanging]] and he was executed in St. Petersburg on 3 September 1866. Ten of his accomplices were sentenced to hard labor, another 25 were acquitted. As a result of the assassination attempt, the Tsar punished [[St Petersburg University]]. Students could no longer form any kind of organisation, no matter how harmless (Ishutin's organisation had officially been to set up sewing [[cooperatives]]). They were subjected to constant surveillance and periodic searches.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

Karakozov was an inspiration for the radical [[nihilists]] [[Sergei Nechaev]] and [[Vera Zasulich]].&lt;ref&gt;Ana Siljak, ''Angel of Vengeance'', p. 92&lt;!-- publishing info needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander II was assassinated in 1881.

The '''European Institute of Cultural Routes''' is a non-profit association based in [[Luxembourg]] whose aim is to help the [[Council of Europe]], as a technical body, in the establishment of [[European Cultural Route]]s.

It was established in 1998 and its role is:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/e/cultural_co%2Doperation/heritage/european_cultural_routes/_Summary.asp   Council of Europe Cultural Routes]&lt;/ref&gt;
* to examine applications for new projects;
* to monitor activities in the field and co-ordinate the work of partner organizations;
* to disseminate and archive information documents.

The Council of Europe:
:'' entrusted the Institute to follow up the already elected routes, to co-ordinate and provide technical aid to networks, in particular in their development in Central and Eastern Europe, to initiate new proposals as well as to disseminate information and set up a database that will constitute the memory of the programme of the cultural routes.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture-routes.lu/php/fo_index.php?lng=en&amp;dest=bd_pa_det&amp;unv=qs&amp;PHPSESSID=b24ba209aa34a60d8b5926f310540d44 European Institute of Cultural Route - Who are we?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614223213/http://www.culture-routes.lu/php/fo_index.php?lng=en&amp;dest=bd_pa_det&amp;unv=qs&amp;PHPSESSID=79953ec9b359b9db14bf01bb6d416bcd |date=2006-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The European Institute of Cultural Routes'''

The European Institute of Cultural Routes (EICR) was established as a European public service and technical body as part of a political agreement between the Council of Europe and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (Ministry of Culture, Further Education and Research). Since 1988 the Institute has worked in close collaboration with the Council of Europe in carrying out its responsibilities, namely to ensure the continuity and development of the programme of the Cultural Routes in the 51 signatory countries of the [[European Cultural Convention]] and, depending on the geographical and historical requirements of the themes, in those countries which have had and continue to have close relations with Europe.

The EICR resides in the [[Neumünster Abbey|Centre Culturel de Rencontre – Abbaye de Neumünster]], in Luxembourg. It retains all relevant documentation and maintains a specialist library on the routes. The Institute regularly welcomes those in charge of the networks of the routes as well as project managers, researchers, students and members of the general public. The EICR is also charged with participating in European training, research and analysis programmes concerning cultural tourism, for the European Commission and various governments and project managers. The Institute organises themed symposiums and specialist training, collaborates in the setting up and running of the Routes, and participates in specialist exhibitions while promoting a greater awareness of the links between culture, tourism and the environment.

From 2004 to 2006 the Institute managed the visibility and communication work of the European research programme PICTURE (Proactive management of the impact of cultural tourism on urban resources and economies).

In 2008 the [[European Commission]] (Directorate-General Education and Culture) named the EICR as a body active on a European level in the field of Culture, in recognition for its essential role in creating a coherent programme of sustainable cultural tourism initiatives promoting the “Destination Europe” and encouraging Europeans to discover their common roots and history through travel and the exploration of material and immaterial heritage.

The Institute is a member of NECSTOUR, an association of European regions working to develop competitive and sustainable tourism, and has signed an agreement with the Cité de la Culture et du Tourisme durable to provide distance-learning and to study the sustainability of introducing tourism to the cultural routes. The Institute is currently working with the Council of Europe and the Tourism Unit of the European Commission on a study into the impact of the cultural routes on small and medium businesses.

In 2011 the Institute welcome a Partial Agreement aimed at combining the voluntary contributions of those member countries of the Council of Europe who wish to increase the funds available to the cultural routes.

Since the opening up of Europe to the East, the Cultural Routes have enabled, and continue to enable (particularly by expanding to include the Southern Caucasus), the creation of a real dialogue between Eastern and Western Europeans. The opening of a resource centre for the Cultural Routes in Sibiu, in the Casa Luxembourg, in liaison with the European Institute of Cultural Routes in Luxembourg and the Mioritics Association is testament to this.

Stefano DOMINIONI  is the current Director of the Institute and Executive Secretary of the Enlarged Partial Agreement on Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe. Michel Tomas Penette and Penelope Denu directed the Institute from 1998 to 2011 and from 2011 to 2015 respectively.

[[Colette Flesch|Colette FLESCH]] is President of the Institute since 2013. She replaced [[Erna Hennicot-Schoepges]] and Guy Dockendorf.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1287">'''Fourth Polish Republic''' ({{lang-pl|IV Rzeczpospolita}} or ''IV RP''), a plan for moral revolution and political change put forth in 1997 by the Polish conservative philosopher Rafał Matyja in the magazine "Nowe Państwo" ("New Country"). "Fourth Republic" was a political [[slogan]] used by the right-leaning [[Law and Justice|Prawo i Sprawiedliwość]] (PiS) party in the [[Polish parliamentary election, 2005|2005 Polish parliamentary election]].

According to PiS, the current [[Third Polish Republic]] is a post-communist creation whose very foundations must be changed to create a truly democratic state free of its past.

“IV RP”, along with it's derivate, “V RP” (''Fifth Polish Republic''), has also been used by the critics to satirize the concept of unnecessary constitutional changes made for arbitrary reasons.

'''Gamla Riksarkivet''' (Old National Archives) is a building at Arkivgatan 3 on [[Riddarholmen]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. [[National Archives of Sweden|Riksarkivet]], the Swedish National Archives, were located in the building until 1968.

The 19th century [[Brick Romanesque]] architecture of the building is alluding to the medieval history of Riddarholmen. The plan of the building is, however, typical for public buildings of its era, the grand style central portion clearly articulated in the façade together with the huge windows of the reading-room.  The building is connected to the [[Stenbock Palace]] where the archive was once started in 1863.  It is also similar in style to the [[Norstedt Building]] located just north of it.&lt;ref name="guide-136"&gt;{{cite book

{{main article|Kuomintang}}
The '''Kuomintang''' (Traditional Chinese: 中國國民黨; Simplified Chinese: 中国国民党; Hanyu Pinyin: Zhōngguó Guómíndǎng; Initials: '''KMT''' or '''GMD''') is a [[Politics of the Republic of China|Chinese political party]] that ruled China 1927–48 and then moved to [[Taiwan]].  The name translates as "China's National People's Party" and was historically referred to as the Chinese Nationalists. The Party was initially founded on 25 August 1912, by [[Sun Yat-sen]] but dissolved in November 1913. It reformed on October 10th 1919, again led by Sun Yat-sen, and became the ruling party in China. After Sun's death, the party was dominated from 1927 to 1975 by [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Though the KMT lost the civil war with the [[Communist Party of China]] in 1949, the party took control of Taiwan and remains a major political party of the [[Republic of China]] based in Taiwan.

Founded in 1912 by [[Sun Yat-sen]], the KMT helped topple the Qing Emperor and promoted modernization along Western lines. The party played a significant part in the first Chinese first National Assembly where it was the majority party. However the KMT failed to achieve complete control. The post of president was given to [[Yuan Shikai]] (1859–1916) as reward for his part in the revolution. Yuan Shikai abused his powers, overriding the constitution and creating strong tensions between himself and the other parties. In July 1913, the KMT staged a 'Second Revolution' to depose Yuan. This failed and the following crack down by Yuan led to the dissolution of the KMT and the exile of its leadership, mostly to Japan. Subsequently, Yuan Shikai had himself made Emperor of China.

In exile, Sun Yat-sen and other former KMT members founded several revolutionary parties under various names but with little success. These parties were united by Sun in 1919 under the title "The Kuomintang of China". The new party returned to Guangzhou in China in 1920 where it set up a government but failed to achieve control of all of China. After the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916, China fractured into many regions controlled by warlords. To strengthen the party's position, it accepted aid and support from the Soviet Union and its Comintern. The fledgling Communist Party of China was encouraged to join the KMT and thus formed the First United Front. The KMT gradually increased its sphere of influence from its Guangzhou base. Sun Yat-sen died in 1925 and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] (1887–1975) became the KMT strong man. In 1926 Chiang led a military operation known as the [[Northern Expedition]] against the warlords that controlled much of the country. In 1927, Chiang instigated the [[April 12 Incident]] in Shanghai in which the Communist Party of China and Communist elements of the KMT were purged.&lt;ref&gt;The event is also known as the Shanghai Massacre of 1927. See Tien-wei Wu,  "A Review of the Wuhan Debacle: the Kuomintang-Communist Split of 1927." '' Journal of Asian Studies'' 1969 29(1): 125–143&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Expedition proved successful and the KMT party came to power throughout China (except Manchuria) in 1927 under the leadership of Chiang. The capital of China was moved to [[Nanjing]] in order to be closer to the party's strong base in southern China.

The party was always concerned with strengthening Chinese identity at the same time it was discarding old traditions in the name of modernity. In 1929, the KMT government suppressed the textbook ''Modern Chinese History,'' widely used in secondary education. The Nationalists were concerned that, by not admitting the existence of the earliest emperors in ancient Chinese history, the book would weaken the foundation of the state. The case of the ''Modern Chinese History'' textbook reflects the symptoms of the period: banning the textbook strengthened the Nationalists' ideological control but also revealed their fear of the New Culture Movement and its more liberal ideological implications.  The KMT tried to destroy the Communist party of [[Mao Zedong]], but was unable to stop the invasion by Japan, which controlled most of the coastline and major cities, 1937–1945. Chiang Kai-shek secured massive military and economic aid from the United States, and in 1945 became one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, with a veto. The KMT governed most of China until it was defeated in the civil war by the Communists in 1949.

The leadership, the remaining army, and hundreds of thousands of businessmen and other supporters, two million in all, fled to Taiwan. They continued to operate there as the "[[Republic of China]]" and dreamed of invading and reconquering what they called "Mainland China". The United States, however, set up a naval cordon after 1950 that has since prevented an invasion in either direction.  The KMT regime kept the island under martial law for 38 years, killing up to 30,000 opponents during its dictatorial rule by Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo (1910–1988).  As the original leadership died off, it had to hold elections, allowed democracy, with full election of parliament in the early 1990s and first direct presidential election in 1996.  After a defeat by the Democratic Progressive Party in 2000, the KMT returned to power in the elections of 2008 and 2012.

==Early years==
[[File:Chiang Kai-shek.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], who assumed the leadership of the Kuomintang (KMT) after the death of [[Sun Yat-sen]] in 1925]]
The Kuomintang traces its roots to the [[Revive China Society]], which was founded in 1895 and merged with several other anti-monarchist societies as the [[Revolutionary Alliance]] in 1905.  After the overthrow of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]] and the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], the Kuomintang was formally established on 25 August 1912 at the [[Huguang Guild Hall]] in [[Beijing]] where the Revolutionary Alliance and several smaller revolutionary groups joined together to contest the first [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] elections.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Strand|Strand 2002]] 59–60&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Whampoa3.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Sun Yat-sen]] [middle] and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] [on stage in uniform] at the founding of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] in 1924.]]
[[Sun Yat-sen]], who had just stepped down as provisional [[president of the Republic of China]], was chosen as its overall leader under the title of [[premier]] ({{zh|t=總理 |p=zǒnglǐ}}), and [[Huang Xing]] was chosen as Sun's deputy. However, the most influential member of the party was the third ranking [[Song Jiaoren]], who mobilized mass support from gentry and merchants for the KMT on a platform of promoting constitutional parliamentary democracy. Though the party had an overwhelming majority in the first National Assembly, [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Yuan Shikai]] started ignoring the parliamentary body in making presidential decisions, counter to the Constitution, and assassinated its parliamentary leader Song Jiaoren in [[Shanghai]] in 1913. Members of the KMT led by Sun Yat-sen staged the [[Second Revolution (China)|Second Revolution]] in July 1913, a poorly planned and ill-supported armed rising to overthrow Yuan, and failed. Yuan dissolved the KMT in November (whose members had largely fled into exile in Japan) and dismissed the parliament early in 1914. [[Yuan Shikai]] proclaimed himself emperor in December 1915.
While exiled in Japan in 1914, Sun established the [[Chinese Revolutionary Party]], but many of his old revolutionary comrades, including [[Huang Xing]], [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Hu Hanmin]] and [[Chen Jiongming]], refused to join him or support his efforts in inciting armed uprising against [[Yuan Shikai]]. In order to join the Chinese Revolutionary Party, members must take an oath of personal loyalty to Sun, which many old revolutionaries regarded as undemocratic and contrary to the spirit of the revolution. Thus, many old revolutionaries did not join Sun's new organization, and he was largely sidelined within the Republican movement during this period. Sun returned to China in 1917 to establish a rival government in [[Guangzhou]], but was soon forced out of office and exiled to Shanghai. There, with renewed support, he resurrected the KMT on 10 October 1919, but under the name of the ''Chinese'' Kuomintang, as the old party had simply been called the Kuomintang. In 1920, Sun and the KMT were restored in Guangdong. In 1923, the KMT and its government accepted aid from the [[Soviet Union]] after being denied recognition by the western powers. Soviet advisers – the most prominent of whom was [[Mikhail Borodin]], an agent of the [[Comintern]] – began to arrive in China in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of the KMT along the lines of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], establishing a [[Leninism|Leninist]] party structure that lasted into the 1990s. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was under Comintern instructions to cooperate with the KMT, and its members were encouraged to join while maintaining their separate party identities, forming the First United Front between the two parties.

Soviet advisers also helped the Nationalists set up a political institute to train propagandists in mass mobilization techniques, and in 1923 [[Chiang Kai-shek]], one of Sun's lieutenants from the [[Tongmenghui]] days, was sent to Moscow for several months' military and political study. At the first party congress in 1924, which included non-KMT delegates such as members of the CCP, they adopted Sun's political theory, which included the [[Three Principles of the People]] – nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood.

==War with Communists==
[[File:kmtarmy.JPG|200px|thumb|[[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalist soldiers]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].]]

Following the death of [[Sun Yat-sen]], General [[Chiang Kai-shek]] emerged as the KMT leader and launched the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]] in 1926  to defeat the [[Warlord era (China)|northern warlords]] and unite China under the party. He halted briefly in [[Shanghai]] in 1927  to [[April 12 Incident|purge the Communists]] who had been allied with the KMT, which sparked the [[Chinese Civil War]]. When Kuomintang forces took Beijing, as the city was the ''[[de jure]]'' internationally recognized capital, though previously controlled by the feuding warlords, this event allowed the Kuomintang to receive widespread diplomatic recognition in the same year. The capital was moved from Beijing to Nanjing, the original capital of the [[Ming Dynasty]], and thus a symbolic purge of the final Qing elements. This period of KMT rule in China between 1927 and 1937 became known as the [[Nanjing decade]].

In sum, the KMT began as a heterogeneous group advocating American-inspired federalism and provincial independence. However, after its reorganization along Soviet lines, the party aimed to establish a centralized [[one-party state]] with one ideology – [[Three Principles of the People]]. This was even more evident following Sun's elevation into a cult figure after his death. The control by one single party began the period of "political tutelage," whereby the party was to control the government while instructing the people on how to participate in a democratic system. After several military campaigns and with the help of German military advisors (German planned fifth "extermination campaign"), the Communists were forced to withdraw from their bases in southern and central China into the mountains in a massive military retreat known famously as the [[Long March]], an undertaking which would eventually increase their reputation among the peasants. Out of the 86,000 Communist soldiers that broke out of the pocket, only 20,000 would make the 10,000&amp;nbsp;km march to Shaanxi province.  The Kuomintang continued to attack the Communists. This was in line with Chiang's policy of solving internal conflicts (warlords and communists) before fighting external invasions (Japan). However, [[Zhang Xueliang]], who believed that the Japanese invasion constituted the greater prevailing threat, took Chiang hostage during the [[Xi'an Incident]] in 1937 and forced Chiang to agree to an alliance with the Communists in the total war against the Japanese.  The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] had officially started, and would last until the Japanese surrender in 1945. However, in many situations the alliance was in name only; after a brief period of cooperation, the armies began to fight the Japanese separately, rather than as coordinated allies. Conflicts between KMT and communists were still common during the war, and documented claims of Communist attacks upon the KMT forces, and vice versa, abound.

In these incidents, it should be noted that The KMT armies typically utilized more traditional tactics while the Communists chose guerilla tactics, leading to KMT claims that the Communists often refused to support the KMT troops, choosing to withdraw and let the KMT troops take the brunt of Japanese attacks.  These same guerilla tactics, honed against the Japanese forces, were used to great success later during open civil war, as well as the Allied forces in the Korean War and the U.S. forces in the Vietnam War.

===1945–49===
Full-scale civil war between the Communists and KMT resumed after the defeat of Japan. The Communist armies, previously a minor faction, grew rapidly in influence and power due to several errors on the KMT's part:  first, the KMT reduced troop levels precipitously after the Japanese surrender, leaving large numbers of able-bodied, trained fighting men who became unemployed and disgruntled with the KMT as prime recruits for the Communists.

Second, the collapse of the KMT regime can in part be attributed to the government's economic policies, which triggered capital flight among the businessmen who had been the KMT's strongest supporters.  The cotton textile industry was the leading sector of Chinese industry, but in 1948, shortages of raw cotton plunged the industry into dire straits. The KMT government responded with an aggressive control policy that directly procured cotton from producers to ensure a sufficient supply and established a price freeze on cotton thread and textiles. This policy failed because of resistance from cotton textile industrialists, who relocated textile facilities and capital to Hong Kong or Taiwan around the end of 1948 and early 1949 when prices soared and inflation spiraled out of control. Their withdrawal of support was a shattering blow to the morale of the KMT.

Among the most despised and ineffective efforts it undertook to contain inflation was the conversion to the gold standard for the national treasury and the [[Gold Standard Script]] ({{zh|t=金圓券 |p=jīn yuán quàn}}) in August 1948, outlawing private ownership of gold, silver, and foreign exchange, collecting all such precious metals and foreign exchange from the people and issuing the Gold Standard Script in exchange.  The new script became worthless in only ten months and greatly reinforced the nationwide perception of KMT as a corrupt or at best inept entity. Third, Chiang Kai-shek ordered his forces to defend the urbanized cities. This decision gave the Communists a chance to move freely through the countryside. At first, the KMT had the edge with the aid of weapons and ammunition from the United States. However, with [[hyperinflation]] and other economic ills, widespread corruption, the KMT continued to lose popular support.  At the same time, the suspension of American aid and tens of thousands of deserted or decommissioned soldiers being recruited to the Communist cause tipped the balance of power quickly to the Communist side, and the overwhelming popular support for the Communists in most of the country made it all but impossible for the KMT forces to carry out successful assaults against the Communists. By the end of 1949, the Communists controlled almost all of [[mainland China]], as the KMT retreated to [[Taiwan]] with a significant amount of China's national treasures and 2 million people, including military forces and refugees. Some party members stayed in the mainland and broke away from the main KMT to found the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang]], which still currently exists as one of the [[list of political parties in the People's Republic of China|eight minor registered parties]] in the [[People's Republic of China]].

==Ideology in Mainland China (1920s–1950s)==

===Chinese nationalism===
The Kuomintang was a nationalist revolutionary party, which had been supported by the [[Soviet Union]]. It was organized on [[Leninism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTgEPrlfvG4C&amp;pg=PA337&amp;dq=chiang+portraits+streets&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UGCaTKLlBsGB8gbyyeBX&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=leninist%20chiang%20democracy&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=504|isbn=0786714840|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kuomintang had several influences left upon its ideology by revolutionary thinking. The Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek used the words [[feudal]] and [[counterrevolutionary]] as synonyms for evil, and backwardness, and proudly proclaimed themselves to be [[revolutionary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYUABRj8IDwC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=kuomintang+anti+feudal&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1DamTObUKIaBlAfLu5gX&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kuomintang%20anti%20feudal&amp;f=false|title=Red Star Over China – The Rise of the Red Army|author=Edgar Snow|year=2008|publisher=READ BOOKS|location=|page=89|isbn=1443736732|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IDbvAzXCBH8C&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=Dear+Ah+Feng,+the+Chinese+Revolution+is+yet+to+be+completed.+But+I,+a+revolutionary,+feel+down-hearted+and+am+unable+to+devote+my+full+energy+to+our+country.+I+only+want+you+to+promise+me+one+thing+and+then+I+shall+find+strength+again+to+work+hard+for+the+revolution.&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fTqmTPHmH8L7lwe7lp0Z&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Dear%20Ah%20Feng%2C%20the%20Chinese%20Revolution%20is%20yet%20to%20be%20completed.%20But%20I%2C%20a%20revolutionary%2C%20feel%20down-hearted%20and%20am%20unable%20to%20devote%20my%20full%20energy%20to%20our%20country.%20I%20only%20want%20you%20to%20promise%20me%20one%20thing%20and%20then%20I%20shall%20find%20strength%20again%20to%20work%20hard%20for%20the%20revolution.&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai-shek's secret past: the memoir of his second wife, Chʻen Chieh-ju|author1=Jieru Chen |author2=Lloyd E.

Chiang Kai-shek, the head of the Kuomintang, warned the Soviet Union and other foreign countries about interfering in Chinese affairs. He was personally angry at the way China was treated by foreigners, mainly by the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States.&lt;ref name="google65"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C&amp;dq=generalissimo+and+he+lost&amp;q=chiang+american+motives#v=snippet&amp;q=chiang%20did%20not%20like%20ally%20american%20motives&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=413|isbn=0786714840|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his [[New Life Movement]] called for the crushing of Soviet, Western, American and other foreign influences in China. Chen Lifu, a [[CC Clique]] member in the KMT, said "Communism originated from Soviet imperialism, which has encroached on our country."  It was also noted that "the white bear of the North Pole is known for its viciousness and cruelty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gnmxDpX7ZlsC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=Can+we+now+call+these+disguised+warlords+and+new+feudalists+genuine+revolutionaries&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SjmmTPKiI4Wdlgen2bwY&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=soviet%20imperialism%20country%20the%20white%20bear%20of%20the%20North&amp;f=false|title=Image, perception, and the making of U.S.-China relations|author1=Hongshan Li |author2=Zhaohui Hong |year=1998|publisher=University Press of America|location=|page=268|isbn=0761811583|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Blue Shirts Society]], a fascist paramilitary organization within the Kuomintang modeled after Mussolini's blackshirts, was anti-foreign and [[Anticommunism|anticommunist]], and stated that its agenda was to expel foreign (Japanese and Western) imperialists from China, crush Communism, and eliminate feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYYYQYK6FAYC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=blueshirts+red+bandits+foreign+insults&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gWmaTKa2L8G88gaF0rSxAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Spymaster: Dai Li and the Chinese secret service|author=Frederic E.

Kuomintang leaders across China adopted nationalist rhetoric. The Chinese Muslim general [[Ma Bufang]] of [[Qinghai]] presented himself as a Chinese nationalist to the people of China, fighting against British imperialism, to deflect criticism by opponents that his government was feudal and oppressed minorities like Tibetans and Buddhist Mongols. He used his Chinese nationalist credentials to his advantage to keep himself in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC&amp;dq=ma+bufang+chinese+nationalism&amp;q=patriotism#v=onepage&amp;q=patriotism%20ma%20bufang%20british&amp;f=false|title=Dilemmas The Mongols at China's edge: history and the politics of national unity |author=Uradyn Erden Bulag|year=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=|page=48|isbn=0742511448|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC&amp;dq=ma+bufang+chinese+nationalism&amp;q=patriotism#v=onepage&amp;q=patriotism%20ma%20bufang%20family%20feudalism&amp;f=false|title=Dilemmas The Mongols at China's edge: history and the politics of national unity |author=Uradyn Erden Bulag|year=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=|page=49|isbn=0742511448|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kuomintang pursued a [[sinicization]] policy, it was stated that "the time had come to set about the business of making all natives either turn Chinese or get out" by foreign observers of Kuomintang policy. It was noted that "Chinese colonization" of "Mongolia and Manchuria" led to the conclusion "to a conviction that the day of the barbarian was finally over."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=z37kTZKwH-b40gGG2pGIBw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=Qb0pAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=The+Kuomintang+urged+that+the+time+had+come+to+set+about+the+business+of+making+all+natives+either+turn+Chinese+or+get+out.+The+Kuomintang+has+but+little+political+power+in+Chinese+Turkistan%2C+because+the+ruling+Chinese+faction&amp;q=kuomintang+business|title=The new Orient; a series of monographs on Oriental culture ...|year=1933|publisher=|edition=|location=|page=116|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=R3_kTcf7AoXi0QG11e20Bw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=rrjQAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=The+Kuomintang+urged+that+the+time+had+come+to+set+about+the+business+of+making+all+natives+either+turn+Chinese+or+get+out.+The+Kuomintang+has+but+little+political+power+in+Chinese+Turkistan%2C+because+the+ruling+Chinese+faction&amp;q=The+Kuomintang+urged+that+the+time+had+come+to+set+about+the+business+of+making+all+natives+either+turn+Chinese+or+get+out.+The+Kuomintang+has+but+little+political+power+in+Chinese+Turkistan%2C+because+the+ruling+Chinese+faction|title=The Open court, Volume 47|editor=Paul Carus|year=1934|publisher=The Open Court Pub.

===New Guangxi Clique===
Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]], the founding father of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] and of the Kuomintang party praised the Boxers in the [[Boxer Rebellion]] for fighting against Western Imperialism. He said the Boxers were courageous and fearless, fighting to the death against the Western armies, Dr. Sun specifically cited the [[Battle of Yangcun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I0kvN9LDHP0C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=yangcun+battle#v=onepage&amp;q=yangcun%20battle&amp;f=false|title=Critical Zone 3: A Forum of Chinese and Western Knowledge|author=Douglas Kerr|year=2009|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|location=|page=151|isbn=9622098576|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang incited anti-foreign, anti-western sentiment. Portraits of Sun Yatsen replaced the crucifix in several churches, KMT posters proclaimed- "Jesus Christ is dead. Why not worship something alive such as Nationalism?". Foreign missionaries were attacked and anti foreign riots broke out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C&amp;dq=chiang+kai-shek+democracy&amp;q=emocracy+absolutely+impossible#v=onepage&amp;q=portraits%20crucifixes%20anti&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=126|isbn=0786714840|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kuomintang branch in Guangxi province, led by the [[New Guangxi Clique]] implemented anti-imperialist, anti-religious, and anti-foreign policies.

During the Northern Expedition, in 1926 in Guangxi, Muslim General [[Bai Chongxi]] led his troops in destroying Buddhist temples and smashing idols, turning the temples into schools and Kuomintang party headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=onepage&amp;q=pai%20smashing%20idols%20decapitating%20statues&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=98|isbn=0521202043|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that almost all of Buddhist monasteries in Guangxi were destroyed by Bai in this manner. The monks were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LxDUeWdMubkC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=bai+chongxi+buddhist+temples&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qvukTJfKO4OB8gb-mamEAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bai%20chongxi%20buddhist%20temples&amp;f=false|title=Toward a modern Chinese Buddhism: Taixu's reforms|author=Don Alvin Pittman|year=2001|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=|page=146|isbn=0-8248-2231-5|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bai led an anti-foreign wave in Guangxi, attacking American, European, and other foreigners and missionaries, and generally making the province unsafe for non-natives. Westerners fled from the province, and some Chinese Christians were also attacked as imperialist agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=snippet&amp;q=missionary%20crowd&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=99|isbn=0521202043|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three goals of his movement were anti-foreign, anti-imperialism, and anti-religion. Bai led the anti-religious movement, against superstition. [[Huang Shaoxiong]], also a Kuomintang member of the New Guangxi Clique, supported Bai's campaign, and Huang was not a Muslim, the anti religious campaign was agreed upon by all Guangxi Kuomintang members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=onepage&amp;q=pai's%20as%20a%20moslem%20other%20religions&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=99|isbn=0521202043|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Kuomintang member, Bai and the other Guangxi clique members allowed the Communists to continue attacking foreigners and smash idols, since they shared the goal of expelling the foreign powers from China, but they stopped Communists from initiating social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=onepage&amp;q=provincial%20kuomintang%20iconoclastic%20foreign&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=100|isbn=0521202043|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General Bai also wanted to aggressively expel foreign powers from other areas of China. Bai gave a speech in which he said that the minorities of china were suffering under foreign oppression. He cited specific examples, such as the Tibetans under the British, the Manchus under the Japanese, the Mongols under the Outer [[Mongolian People's Republic]], and the Uyghurs of Xinjiang under the Soviet Union. Bai called upon China to assist them in expelling the foreigners from those lands. He personally wanted to lead an expedition to seize back Xinjiang to bring it under Chinese control, in the style that [[Zuo Zongtang]] led during the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=onepage&amp;q=pai%20minority%20tibetans%20british%20foreign&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=124|isbn=0521202043|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General Ma Bufang, a Sufi, who backed the [[Yihewani]] Muslims, and persecuted the [[Fundamentalist]] [[Salafi]]/[[Wahhabi]] Muslim sect. The Yihewani forced the Salafis into hiding. They were not allowed to move or worship openly. The Yihewani had become secular and Chinese nationalist, and they considered the Salafiyya to be "Heterodox" (xie jiao), and people who followed foreigner's teachings (waidao). Only after the Communists took over were the Salafis allowed to come out and worship openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wEih57-GWQQC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=ma+bufang+secret+war&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Lh6YTKKkLYT68AbGy7iKAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20bufang%20secret%20war&amp;f=false|title=Guide to Islamist Movements|author=BARRY RUBIN|year=2000|publisher=M.E.

===Socialism and anti-capitalist agitation===
{{main article|Socialist ideology of the Kuomintang|Canton Merchant Volunteers Corps Uprising}}
The Kuomintang had a left wing and a right wing, the left being more radical in its pro Soviet policies, but both wings equally persecuted merchants, accusing them of being counterrevolutionaries and reactionaries. The right wing under Chiang Kaishek prevailed, and continued radical policies against private merchants and industrialists, even as they denounced communism.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

One of the [[Three Principles of the People]] of the Kuomintang, Mínshēng, was defined as socialism as Dr. Sun Yatsen. He defined this principle of saying in his last days "it's socialism and it's communism.". The concept may be understood as [[social welfare]] as well. Sun understood it as an industrial economy and equality of land holdings for the Chinese peasant farmers. Here he was influenced by the American thinker [[Henry George]] (see [[Georgism]]) and German thinker [[Karl Marx]]; the [[land value tax]] in Taiwan is a legacy thereof. He divided livelihood into four areas: food, clothing, housing, and transportation; and planned out how an ideal (Chinese) government can take care of these for its people.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The Kuomintang was referred to having a socialist ideology. "Equalization of land rights" was a clause included by Dr. Sun in the original Tongmenhui. The Kuomintang's revolutionary ideology in the 1920s incorporated unique Chinese [[Socialism]] as part of its ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-aGLEtx7AYC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=the+program+rested+the+origins+of+the+rather+unique+socialism+of+the+Guomindang+and+of+Sun+Yat-sen&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IkCpTJDXFsT7lwehtpCPDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20program%20rested%20the%20origins%20of%20the%20rather%20unique%20socialism%20of%20the%20Guomindang%20and%20of%20Sun%20Yat-sen&amp;f=false|title=The Marxism in the Chinese revolution|author=Arif Dirlik|year=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=|page=20|isbn=0742530698|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHnmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=the+program+rested+the+origins+of+the+rather+unique+socialism+of+the+Guomindang+and+of+Sun+Yat-sen&amp;dq=the+program+rested+the+origins+of+the+rather+unique+socialism+of+the+Guomindang+and+of+Sun+Yat-sen&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RkCpTK-OIcT_lge-xYnVDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAQ|title=Studies in comparative communism, Volume 21|author=Von KleinSmid Institute of International Affairs, University of Southern California.

The Soviet Union trained Kuomintang revolutionaries in the [[Moscow Sun Yat-sen University]]. In the West and in the Soviet Union, Chiang was known as the "Red General".&lt;ref name="Hannah Pakula 2009 346"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZpVntUTZfkC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;dq=chiang+was+then+known+as+the+red+general+movies&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TXiaTISmAcT38Abi7fyWAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=chiang%20was%20then%20known%20as%20the%20red%20general%20movies&amp;f=false|title=The last empress: Madame Chiang Kai-Shek and the birth of modern China|author=Hannah Pakula|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=|page=346|isbn=1439148937|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Movie theaters in the Soviet Union showed newsreels and clips of Chiang, at Moscow Sun Yat-sen University Portraits of Chiang were hung on the walls, and in the Soviet May Day Parades that year, Chiang's portrait was to be carried along with the portraits of Karl Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and other socialist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_5R2fnVZXiwC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=chiang+portraits+streets&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UGCaTKLlBsGB8gbyyeBX&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBg#v=snippet&amp;q=chiang%20portraits%20marx&amp;f=false|title=The Generalissimo's son: Chiang Ching-kuo and the revolutions in China and Taiwan|author=Jay Taylor|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=|page=42|isbn=0674002873|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kuomintang attempted to levy taxes upon merchants in [[Guangzhou|Canton]], and the merchants resisted by raising an army, the Merchant's volunteer corps. Dr. Sun initiated this anti merchant policy, and Chiang Kai-shek enforced it, Chiang led his army of [[Whampoa Military Academy]] graduates to defeat the merchant's army. Chiang was assisted by Soviet advisors, who supplied him with weapons, while the merchants were supplied with weapons from the Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C&amp;dq=chiang+kai-shek+democracy&amp;q=emocracy+absolutely+impossible#v=onepage&amp;q=merchants%20militia&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=71|isbn=0786714840|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZpVntUTZfkC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=I+have+often+thought+that+i+am+the+most+clever+woman+that+ever+lived,+and+others+cannot+compare+with+me&amp;cd=1#v=snippet&amp;q=merchants%20levy%20taxes&amp;f=false|title=The last empress: Madame Chiang Kai-Shek and the birth of modern China|author=Hannah Pakula|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=|page=128|isbn=1439148937|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kuomintang were accused of leading a "Red Revolution"in Canton. The merchants were [[conservative]] and [[reactionary]], and their Volunteer Corp leader Chen Lianbao was a prominent [[comprador]] trader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C&amp;dq=chiang+kai-shek+democracy&amp;q=emocracy+absolutely+impossible#v=onepage&amp;q=merchants%20compradoer%20reactionaries%20conservatives%20red&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=71|isbn=0786714840|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The merchants were supported by the foreign, western Imperialists such as the British, who led an international flotilla to support them against Dr. Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZpVntUTZfkC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=I+have+often+thought+that+i+am+the+most+clever+woman+that+ever+lived,+and+others+cannot+compare+with+me&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=customs%20surplus%20merchants%20levy%20taxes&amp;f=false|title=The last empress: Madame Chiang Kai-Shek and the birth of modern China|author=Hannah Pakula|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=|page=128|isbn=1439148937|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang seized the western supplied weapons from the merchants, and battled against them.

In 1948, the Kuomintang again attacked the merchants of Shanghai, Chiang Kaishek sent his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] to restore economic order. Ching-kuo copied [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] methods, which he learned during his stay there, to start a social revolution by attacking middle class merchants. He also enforced low prices on all goods to raise support from the [[Proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C&amp;dq=soong+slap+chiang&amp;q=chiang+middle+class+social+revolution+soviet#v=snippet&amp;q=middle%20class%20social%20revolution%20soviet&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=485|isbn=0786714840|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As riots broke out and savings were ruined, bankrupting shopowners, Ching-kuo began to attack the wealthy, seizing assets and placing them under arrest. The son of the gangster [[Du Yuesheng]] was arrested by him. Ching-kuo ordered Kuomintang agents to raid the Yangtze Development Corporation's warehouses, which was privately owned by [[H.H. Kung]] and his family. H.H. Kung's wife was [[Soong Ai-ling]], the sister of [[Soong Mei-ling]] who was Ching-kuo's stepmother. H.H. Kung's son David was arrested, the Kung's responded by blackmailing the Chiang's, threatening to release information about them, eventually he was freed after negotiations, and Ching-kuo resigned, ending the terror on the Shanghainese merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C&amp;pg=PA339&amp;dq=soong+slap+chiang&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r4SmTLqoMoSKlwemtZQY&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ching-kuo%20turned%20on%20rich%20assets%20agents%20raided&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=486|isbn=0786714840|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kuomintang also promotes [[Government-owned corporation]]s. The Kuomintang founder [[Sun Yat-sen]], was heavily influenced by the economic ideas of [[Henry George]], who believed that the rents extracted from [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] or the usage of land belonged to the public.  Dr. Sun argued for [[Georgism]] and emphasized the importance of a mixed economy, which he termed "The Principle of Minsheng" in his [[Three Principles of the People]].

"The railroads, public utilities, canals, and forests should be nationalized, and all income from the land and mines should be in the hands of the State.  With this money in hand, the State can therefore finance the social welfare programs."&lt;ref&gt;Simei Qing "From Allies to Enemies", 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kuomintang Muslim Governor of [[Ningxia]], [[Ma Hongkui]] promoted state owned monopoly companies. His government had a company, Fu Ning Company, which had a monopoly over commercial and industry in Ningxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=2p-qTNjVLIL-8Ab984CIBw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=kt0gAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=ma+hung-k%27uei&amp;q=In+short%2C+the+developmental+and+reconstruction+activities+of+Ma+Hung-k%27uei%27s+government+follow+the+same+lines+as+in+Chinghai|title=China on the eve of Communist takeover|author=A.

The Kuomintang Muslim Governor of [[Qinghai]], General [[Ma Bufang]] was described as a socialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nDgbAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=ma+bufang+taiwan&amp;dq=ma+bufang+taiwan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QBHJTJXABML7lwfXne3nAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwATgK|title=Covering China: the story of an American reporter from revolutionary days to the Deng era|author=John Roderick|year=1993|publisher=Imprint Publications|location=|page=104|isbn=1879176173|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; An American scholar and government advisor, [[A.

While most of China is bogged down, almost inevitably, by Civil War, Chinghai is attempting to carry our small-scale, but nevertheless ambitious, development and reconstruction schemes on its own initiative"

General Ma started a state run and controlled industrialization project, directly creating educational, medical, agricultural, and sanitation projects, run or assisted by the state. The state provided money for food and uniforms in all schools, state run or private. Roads and a theater were constructed. The state controlled all the press, no freedom was allowed for independent journalists. His regime was dictatoral in its political system. Barnett admitted that the regime had "stern authoritarianism" and "little room for personal freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Caknr1VAqMC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=ma+bufang+communist+saw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dYegTcupA-iO0QHU4OWEBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=China's communist revolutions: fifty years of the People's Republic of China|author1=Werner Draguhn |author2=David S.

Corporations such as [[CSBC Corporation, Taiwan]], [[CPC Corporation, Taiwan]] and [[Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation]] are owned by the state in the [[Republic of China]].

[[Marxist]]s also existed in the Kuomintang party. They viewed the Chinese revolution in different terms than the Communists, claiming that China already went past its feudal stage and in a stagnation period rather than in another mode of production. These Marxists in the Kuomintang opposed the Chinese communist party ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usOMZjTWrJ0C&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=china+stagnated+feudalism+political&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AvO4TPjFE4T6lwfa5oWwDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=guomindang%20marxists&amp;f=false|title=Feudalism and non-European societies|author1=T.

When the Northern Expedition was complete, Kuomintang Generals led by Chiang Kaishek paid tribute to Dr. Sun's soul in heaven with a sacrificial ceremony at the Xiangshan Temple in Beijing in July 1928, among the Kuomintang Generals present were the Muslim Generals Bai Chongxi and Ma Fuxiang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ubcpress.ca/books/pdf/chapters/2006/tibetandnationalistchina'sfrontier.pdf|title=Tibet and nationalist China's frontier: intrigues and ethnopolitics, 1928–49|author=Hsiao-ting Lin|year=2006|publisher=UBC Press|location=|page=29|isbn=0774813016|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kuomintang backed the [[New Life Movement]], which promoted Confucianism, and it was also against westernization.

The Kuomintang leaders also opposed the [[May Fourth Movement]]. [[Chiang Kai-shek]], as a nationalist, and Confucianist, was against the iconoclasm of the May Fourth Movement. He viewed some western ideas as foreign, as a Chinese nationalist, and that the introduction of western ideas and literature that the May Fourth Movement wanted was not welcome. He and [[Dr. Sun Yat-sen]] criticized these May Fourth intellectuals for corrupting morals of youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc4UAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=chiang+may+iconoclastic+nationalist&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=P2yaTIiKJsKB8ga-oPVK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The May fourth movement in Shanghai: the making of a social movement in modern China|author=Joseph T.

Imams sponsored by the Kuomintang called for Muslims to go on [[Jihad]] to become [[Shahid|shaheed]] (Muslim term for martyr) in battle, where Muslims believed they would go automatically to heaven. Becoming a shaheed in the Jihad for the country was encouraged by the Kuomintang, which was called "glorious death for the state" and a [[hadith]] promoting nationalism was spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJzB6wrz6Q4C&amp;dq=ma+fuxiang+military+academy&amp;q=anti+japanese#v=snippet&amp;q=anti%20japanese%20hadith&amp;f=false|title=Intellectuals in the modern Islamic world: transmission, transformation, communication|author1=Stéphane A.

The Kuomintang also incorporated [[Confucianism]] in its [[jurisprudence]]. It pardoned [[Shi Jianqiao]] for murdering [[Sun Chuanfang]], because she did it in revenge since Sun executed her father Shi Congbin, which was an example of [[Filial piety]] to one's parents in Confucianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxG188kNRWUC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=Shi+Jianqiao+confucianism+filial&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MkapTI_DDoGglAeD-6zHDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=nationalist%20pardoned&amp;f=false|title=Public passions: the trial of Shi Jianqiao and the rise of popular sympathy in Republican China|author=Eugenia Lean|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=|page=148|isbn=0520247183|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kuomintang encouraged filial revenge killings and extended pardons to those who performed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxG188kNRWUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Shi+Jianqiao&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V0WpTMqpOoa8lQfLz8SqDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=filial%20pardons%20motive%20endorsement%20of%20revenge&amp;f=false|title=Public passions: the trial of Shi Jianqiao and the rise of popular sympathy in Republican China|author=Eugenia Lean|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=|page=150|isbn=0520247183|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modernization====
Historians until the 1990s often portrayed the KMT simply as a band of corrupt leaders who colluded with rich financiers and industrialists and cared little for China's workers and peasants, contrasting it with the supposed broad base of popular support for the communists.  However, as Bodenhorn (2002) shows, scholars are coming to an appreciation of its efforts to build a vibrant and dynamic state, before it lost on the battlefield to the Communists, but then had a second chance on Taiwan where they did succeed.&lt;ref&gt;
Terry Bodenhorn, ed. ''Defining Modernity: Guomindang Rhetorics of a New China, 1920–1970'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The KMT promoted science and industry, and tried to eradicate such traditional practices as footbinding, and extravagant marriage and funerary customs.  The KMT had a complicated relationship to Christian missionary activity.  Many high officials (including Chiang) were Christians and American public opinion that favored China was based on the missionaries. At the same time in the villages the KMT  criticized missionary activity as an egregious example of imperialism. No significant action against the churches was taken but criticizing them was a much safer way to spread the anti-imperialist message of the KMT than taking on foreign firms or the U.S. The anti-Christian movements were important tactically for gaining the support of students and others in society who were angry at the influence of outsiders in China.

The Kuomintang purged China's education system of western ideas, introducing [[Confucianism]] into the curriculum.

==KMT in Taiwan==
[[File:KMT Headquarters, Taipei.JPG|300px|thumb|The former KMT headquarters in [[Taipei City]]; the imposing structure directly faced the [[Presidential Building (Taiwan)|Presidential Building]], was seen as a symbol of the party's wealth and dominance.]]

In 1895, Taiwan, including the [[Pescadores]], became a Japanese colony, a concession by the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing Empire]] after it lost the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. After Japan's defeat at the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, [[General Order No. 1]] instructed Japan, who surrendered to the US, to surrender its troops in Taiwan to the forces of the Republic of China Kuomintang.

Taiwan was placed under the administrative control of the Republic of China by the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA), and the ROC put Taiwan under military occupation.  Tensions between the local Taiwanese and [[Mainland Chinese|mainlander]]s from [[mainland China]] increased in the intervening years culminating in a flashpoint on 27 February 1947 in [[Taipei]] when a dispute between a female cigarette vendor and an anti-smuggling officer triggered civil disorder and protests that would last for days.  The uprising turned bloody and was shortly put down by the [[Military of the Republic of China|ROC Army]] in the [[February 28 Incident]].

Following the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] ([[People's Republic of China|PRC]]) on 1 October 1949, the commanders of the PRC People's Liberation Army believed that [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] had to be taken before a final assault on Taiwan. KMT fought the [[Battle of Kuningtou]] and stopped the invasion. In 1950  Chiang took office in [[Taipei]] under the [[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]]. The provision declared [[martial law in Taiwan]] and halted some democratic processes, including presidential and parliamentary elections, until the mainland could be recovered from the Communists. KMT estimated it would take 3 years to defeat the Communists.  The slogan was "prepare in the first year, start fighting in the second, and conquer in the third year." However, various factors, including international pressure, are believed to have prevented the KMT from militarily engaging the Communists full-scale. A cold war with a couple of minor military conflicts was resulted in the early years. The various government bodies previously in [[Nanjing]] were re-established in Taipei as the KMT-controlled government actively claimed sovereignty over all China. The [[Republic of China]] in Taiwan retained [[China and the United Nations|China's seat in the United Nations]] until 1971 .
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Chiang Ching-kuo.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Chiang Ching-kuo]], was the son of Chiang Kai-shek and Leader of the Kuomintang (KMT) between 1975 – 1988.]] --&gt;
Until the 1970s, KMT successfully pushed ahead with land reforms, developed the economy, implemented a democratic system in a lower level of the government, improved cross-Taiwan Strait relations, and created the [[Taiwan economic miracle]]. However KMT controlled the government under a one-party authoritarian state until reforms in the late 1970s through the 1990s. As a result of the [[February 28 Incident]] in 1947, Taiwanese people had to endure what is called the "[[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]]", a KMT-led political repression. The ROC in Taiwan was once referred to synonymously with the KMT and known simply as "Nationalist China" after its ruling party. In the 1970s, the KMT began to allow for "supplemental elections" in Taiwan to fill the seats of the aging representatives in parliament. Although opposition parties were not permitted, [[Tangwai]] (or, "outside the party") representatives were tolerated. In the 1980s, the KMT focused on transforming the government from a one-party system to a [[multi-party]] democracy one and embracing "[[Taiwanese localization movement|Taiwanizing]]". With the founding of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) in 1986, the KMT started competing against the DPP in Parliamentary elections. In 1991, [[martial law]] ceased when President [[Lee Teng-Hui]] terminated the [[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]]. All parties started to be allowed to compete at all levels of elections, including the presidential election. [[Lee Teng-hui]], the ROC's first democratically elected President and the leader of the KMT during the 1990s, announced his advocacy of "special state-to-state relations" with the PRC. The PRC associated it with [[Taiwan independence]].

The KMT faced a split in 1994  that led to the formation of the [[New Party (Republic of China)|Chinese New Party]], alleged to be a result of Lee's "corruptive ruling style". The New Party has, since the purging of Lee, largely reintegrated into KMT. A much more serious split in the party occurred as a result of the [[ROC presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential election]]. Upset at the choice of [[Lien Chan]] as the party's presidential nominee, former party Secretary-General [[James Soong]] launched an independent bid, which resulted in the expulsion of Soong and his supporters and the formation of the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People's First Party]] (PFP). The KMT candidate placed third behind Soong in the elections. After the election, Lee's strong relationship with the opponent became apparent. In order to prevent defections to the PFP, Lien moved the party away from Lee's pro-independence policies and became more favorable toward [[Chinese reunification]]. This shift led to Lee's expulsion from the party and the formation of the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]].

==Current issues and challenges==
{{Update|date=November 2010}}
[[File:Kuomintang nanjing.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Lien Chan]] [middle] and [[Wu Po-hsiung]] [second left] and the Kuomintang touring the [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum]] in [[Nanjing]], the [[People's Republic of China]]. The [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China|Pan-Blue coalition visited the mainland]] in 2005.]]
As the ruling party on Taiwan, the KMT amassed a vast business empire of banks, investment companies, petrochemical firms, and television and radio stations, thought to have made it the world's richest political party, with assets once estimated to be around US$2–10 billion.&lt;ref name="KMT_asset"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=898158|publisher=Economist|title= Taiwan's Kuomintang On the brink|date=6 Dec 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this war chest appeared to help the KMT until the mid-1990s, it later led to accusations of corruption (see [[Black gold (politics)]]). After 2000, the KMT's financial holdings appeared to be more of a liability than a benefit, and the KMT started to divest its assets. However, the transactions were not disclosed and the whereabouts of the money earned from selling assets (if it has gone anywhere) is unknown. There were accusations in the [[ROC presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]] that the KMT retained assets that were illegally acquired. Currently, there is a law proposed by the DPP in the [[Legislative Yuan]] to recover illegally acquired party assets and return them to the government; however, since the pan-Blue alliance, the KMT and its smaller partner PFP, control the legislature, it is very unlikely to be passed. The KMT also acknowledged that part of its assets were acquired through extra-legal means and thus promised to "retro-endow" them to the government. However, the quantity of the assets which should be classified as illegal are still under heated debate; [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]], in its capacity as ruling party from 2000–2008, claimed that there is much more that the KMT has yet to acknowledge. Also, the KMT actively sold assets under its title in order to quench its recent financial difficulties, which the DPP argues is illegal. Former KMT Chairman [[Ma Ying-Jeou]]'s position is that the KMT will sell some of its properties at below market rates rather than return them to the government and that the details of these transactions will not be publicly disclosed.

In December 2003, then-KMT chairman (present chairman emeritus) and presidential candidate [[Lien Chan]] initiated what appeared to some to be a major shift in the party's position on the linked questions of Chinese reunification and Taiwan independence. Speaking to foreign journalists, Lien said that while the KMT was opposed to "immediate independence," it did not wish to be classed as "pro-reunificationist" either.

At the same time, [[Wang Jin-pyng]], speaker of the [[Legislative Yuan]] and the Pan-Blue Coalition's campaign manager in the [[ROC presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], said that the party no longer opposed Taiwan's "eventual independence." This statement was later clarified as meaning that the KMT opposes any immediate decision on unification and independence and would like to have this issue resolved by future generations. The KMT's position on the cross-strait relationship was redefined as hoping to remain in the current neither-independent-nor-united situation.
[[File:Ma Ying-jeou Berkeley 2006 (cropped).jpg|210px|left|thumb|[[Ma Ying-jeou]], the former ROC President and was the former chairman of the Kuomintang from 2005 to 2007.]]
In 2005, then-party chairman [[Lien Chan]] announced that he was to leave his office. The two leading contenders for the position include [[Ma Ying-jeou]] and [[Wang Jin-pyng]]. On 5 April 2005, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said he wished to lead the opposition Kuomintang with Wang Jin-pyng. On 16 July 2005, Ma was elected as KMT chairman in the [[KMT chairmanship election, 2005|first contested leadership in Kuomintang's 93-year history]]. Some 54 percent of the party's 1.04 million members cast their ballots. [[Ma Ying-jeou]] garnered 72.4 percent of vote share, or 375,056 votes, against [[Wang Jin-pyng]]'s 27.6 percent, or 143,268 votes. After failing to convince Wang to stay on as a vice chairman, Ma named holdovers [[Wu Po-hsiung]] (吳伯雄), [[Chiang Pin-kung]] (江丙坤), and [[Lin Cheng-chi]] (林澄枝), as well as long-time party administrator and strategist [[John Kuan]] (關中), as vice-chairmen; all appointments were approved by a hand count of party delegates.

There has been a recent warming of relations between the [[pan-blue coalition]] and the PRC, with prominent members of both the KMT and PFP in active discussions with officials on the Mainland. In February 2004, it appeared that KMT had opened a campaign office for the Lien-Soong ticket in [[Shanghai]] targeting Taiwanese businessmen. However, after an adverse reaction in Taiwan, the KMT quickly declared that the office was opened without official knowledge or authorization. In addition, the PRC issued a statement forbidding open campaigning in the Mainland and formally stated that it had no preference as to which candidate won and cared only about the positions of the winning candidate.

On 28 March 2005, thirty members of the Kuomintang (KMT), led by KMT vice chairman [[Chiang Pin-kung]], [[2005 Kuomintang visits to Mainland|arrived in mainland China]].  This marked the first official visit by the KMT to the mainland since it was defeated by communist forces in 1949 (although KMT members including Chiang had made individual visits in the past). The delegates began their itinerary by paying homage to the revolutionary martyrs of the Tenth Uprising at [[Huanghuagang]]. They subsequently flew to the former ROC capital of [[Nanjing]] to commemorate Sun Yat-sen. &lt;!-- The ''[[China Times]]'', a Taiwan-based newspaper, said the group was to meet Thursday with [[Jia Qinglin]], nominally fourth-ranking CPC politician and a deputy head of the cabinet-level [[Taiwan Affairs Office]]. A top agenda item for Chiang was the anti-secession law, passed by China's parliament earlier in the month that authorized the use of "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan if it were to move towards formal independence.--&gt; During the trip KMT signed a 10-points agreement with the CPC. The opponents regarded this visit as the prelude of the third KMT-CPC cooperation. Weeks afterwards, in May, Chairman [[Lien Chan]] visited the mainland and met with [[Hu Jintao]]. No agreements were signed because [[Chen Shui-bian]]'s government threatened to prosecute the KMT delegation for treason and violation of R.O.C. laws prohibiting citizens from collaborating with Communists.

On 13 February 2007, Ma was indicted by the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office on charges of allegedly embezzling approximately NT$11 million (US$339,000), regarding the issue of "special expenses" while he was mayor of Taipei. Shortly after the indictment, he submitted his resignation as chairman of the Kuomintang at the same press conference at which he formally announced his candidacy for President.  Ma argued that it was customary for officials to use the special expense fund for personal expenses undertaken in the course of their official duties.  In December 2007, Ma was acquitted of all charges and immediately filed suit against the prosecutors who are also appealing the acquittal.

The '''honors music''' for a person, office or rank is music played on formal or ceremonial occasions in the presence of the person, office-holder, or rank-holder, especially by a [[military band]]. The [[head of state]] in many countries is honored with a prescribed piece of music; in some countries the [[national anthem]] serves this purpose, while others have a separate '''royal''', '''presidential''', or, historically, '''imperial anthem'''. Other officials may also have anthems, such as the '''vice-regal salute''' in several [[Commonwealth realm]]s for the [[Governor-General]], Governor, or Lieutenant Governor. [[Ruffles and flourishes]] may be played instead of, or preceding, honors music.

==Current honors music==
Countries where the national anthem is also the royal anthem include [[Jamaica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kingshouse.gov.jm/protocol|title=National Anthem |publisher=[[King's House, Jamaica|King's House]] |location=Jamaica |accessdate=2012-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malaysia]],&lt;ref name="malaysia1968"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%208/Act%20390.pdf |format=PDF |title=Act 390: National Anthem Act 1968; Incorporating all amendments up to 1 January 2006 |year=2006 |publisher=Commissioner of Law Revision |location=Malaysia |accessdate=2 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref name=mindefnl /&gt; [[Norfolk Island]], [[Spain]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Jordan]], [[Brunei]] and [[Cambodia]].

The Project is presently based at [[Simon Fraser University]]'s School for International Studies at [[Harbour Centre]] in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report Project: [http://www.hsrgroup.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=342&amp;Itemid=68 About the Project] (accessed March 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; having formerly been based at the [[University of British Columbia]]'s [[Liu Institute for Global Issues]] in the Human Security Centre.[[Image:HSRP Logo.png|thumb|Human Security Report Project (HSRP)]]

== Publications and services ==
The Project is known primarily for the ''[[Human Security Report 2005]]'', which provided evidence that, according to the Project's data and definitions, there had been a large decline in the number of [[war]]s, [[genocide]]s, and international crises since the end of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005:  [http://www.humansecurityreport.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=69 The HSR In the News] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516033240/http://www.humansecurityreport.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=69 |date=2008-05-16 }} (accessed May 25, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005: [http://www.humansecurityreport.info/HSR2005_PDF/Overview.pdf Overview] (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Project adopts the 'narrow' conception of [[Human Security]]. The distinction between the 'narrow' and 'broad' concepts of Human Security, is summarized [[Human security#Freedom from Fear vs Freedom from Want and beyond|here]] on the Human Security page.&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in armed conflict in recent history has been referred to as the [[Long Peace]],&lt;ref name="Gaddis1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaddis|first=John Lewis|title=The Long Peace: Inquiries Into the History of the Cold War|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-504335-9|url=https://www.amazon.com/Long-Peace-Inquiries-Into-History/dp/0195043359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freedman|first1=Lawrence|title=Stephen Pinker and the long peace: alliance, deterrence and decline|journal=Cold War History|volume=14|issue=4|year=2014|pages=657–672|issn=1468-2745|doi=10.1080/14682745.2014.950243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is general agreement among experts that the frequency of war has declined since at least the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Freedman2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HSC2013"/&gt; despite a widespread misperception that the world has become more dangerous.&lt;ref name="HSC2013"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Human Security Report 2013: The Decline in Global Violence| author = Human Security Research Group, [[Simon Fraser University]]| date = 2013| access-date = 11 November 2018| url = https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/HSRP_Report_2013_140226_Web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fettweis2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fettweis|first1=Christopher J.|title=Unipolarity, Hegemony, and the New Peace|journal=Security Studies|volume=26|issue=3|year=2017|pages=423–451|issn=0963-6412|doi=10.1080/09636412.2017.1306394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the Project published the ''Human Security Brief 2006'', updating the core global trend data from the 2005 ''Report'', and the ''Human Security Brief 2007''. The 2007 ''Brief'' demonstrated that there had been a sharp decline in the incidence of [[Terrorism|terrorist]] violence (measured in terms of numbers of fatalities) around the world. If fatalities from [[political violence]] against [[civilian]]s perpetrated by [[Non-state actor|non-state groups]] in [[Iraq]] are counted as deaths from terrorism, the decline dated mid-2007. This claim was disputed in a press release from the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]'s [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism]] (START).&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Brief 2007: [http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter1.pdf Chapter 1- Dying to Lose: Explaining the Decline in Global Terrorism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120005915/http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter1.pdf |date=2008-11-20 }} (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of Maryland Newsdesk: [http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/sociss/release.cfm?ArticleID=1667 Terrorism Fatalities Up, Not Down UMD Analysis Disputes New Report] (accessed March 22, 2009). {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621114431/http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/sociss/release.cfm?ArticleID=1667 |date=June 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, START at that time only had incident data to 2004. Subsequent START reports confirmed the large decline in fatalities from terrorism in 2007. One problem with the START project's dataset is that it counts politically motivated killings of civilians in [[civil war]] by non-state actors as terrorism in some contexts, but not in others.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} In Iraq, for example, such killings are counted as acts of terrorism, but the very large number of comparable killings in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]'s civil wars in the 1990s are not. Subsequent to the publication of the 2007 ''Brief'', the incidence of global terrorism has again increased, with most of the increase being in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. Further, the 2007 ''Brief'' suggested positive change in Sub-Saharan Africa's security landscape; the number of conflicts being waged in the region more than halved between 1999 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Brief 2007: [http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter2.pdf Chapter 2- Towards A New Peace in Africa?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120000129/http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter2.pdf |date=2008-11-20 }} (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2008, the Project published, in conjunction with the [[World Bank]], the ''miniAtlas of Human Security''.&lt;ref name="atlas of human security"&gt;[http://www.miniatlasofhumansecurity.info/en/ miniAtlas of Human Security] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311073705/http://miniatlasofhumansecurity.info/en/ |date=2009-03-11 }} (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; This publication was produced in three languages and is an "at-a-glance guide to global security issues", using a selection of maps and graphics to illustrate security trends, and is part of the World Bank's ''miniAtlas'' series.&lt;ref name="atlas of human security" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.worldbank.org/ecommerce/catalog/simple-search?has_results_p=1&amp;search_type_to_pass=title&amp;search_text=miniAtlas World Bank miniAtlas Series] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717075252/http://publications.worldbank.org/ecommerce/catalog/simple-search?has_results_p=1&amp;search_type_to_pass=title&amp;search_text=miniAtlas |date=2011-07-17 }} (accessed March 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; There have been subsequent translations of the ''miniAtlas'' into Russian, Japanese, and Arabic.

In 2010, the Project launched the ''Human Security Report 2009/2010'' at the [[United Nations]]. Part I of the ''Report'' examines "The Causes of Peace" since the end of [[World War II]]. Part II examines "The Shrinking Costs of War", paying particular attention to "indirect deaths" from war-exacerbated disease and [[malnutrition]]. Part III reviews recent trends in organized violence around the world. A hard copy version of the ''Report'' was published by [[Oxford University Press]] early in 2011. The text of the ''Report'' is freely available online at www.hsrgroup.org.

In addition to its publications, the Project runs several free e-services available in a number of delivery formats:

== Funding and collaboration ==
The Project works closely with a number of the world's leading research groups in peace and conflict studies, including:&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report Project: [http://www.hsrgroup.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=56 Partners] (accessed March 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]], based in [[Norway]]
*The [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]], based in [[Sweden]]

It has received funding from a number of governments, including:

*Canada's [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]]
*The [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Department for International Development]]
*The [[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]
*The [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]]
*The [[Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]]

The Project is a principal partner of the [[International Relations and Security Network]].

== Criticism ==

Lack of robust conflict data remains a major problem with all attempts to track conflict numbers and fatality trends. The Uppsala Conflict Data Program's has an acknowledged tendency to undercount fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005: [http://www.humansecurityreport.info/HSR2005_PDF/Part2.pdf Part II- The Human Security Audit] (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; But the tendency to undercount does not obscure trends, and both researchers and policymakers who focus on the causes of war and peace are more concerned with trends––are the number of wars/battle deaths increasing or decreasing?––than in absolute numbers. For [[truth and reconciliation commission]]s, the reverse is true. There are various methodologies that can be used to estimate war deaths––incident-based reporting like that undertaken by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, nationwide retrospective mortality surveys like those undertaken in Iraq and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and censuses. Each has strengths and weaknesses. Uppsala's methodology is, however, the only one that permits timely annual updates for all conflict-affected countries. There are ongoing debates on the validity of data compiling and counting methodology. Part III of the ''Human Security Report 2009/2010'' contains a discussion of these debates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23279">{{Roman government}}
The '''legislative assemblies of the Roman Republic''' were political institutions in the ancient [[Roman Republic]].  According to the contemporary historian [[Polybius]], it was the people (and thus the assemblies) who had the final say regarding the election of magistrates, the enactment of [[Roman law]]s, the carrying out of capital punishment, the declaration of war and peace, and the creation (or dissolution) of alliances. Under the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic]], the people (and thus the assemblies) held the ultimate source of sovereignty.

Since the Romans used a form of [[direct democracy]], citizens, and not elected representatives, voted before each assembly. As such, the citizen-electors had no power, other than to cast a vote. Each assembly was presided over by a single [[Roman Magistrate]], and as such, it was the presiding magistrate who made all decisions on matters of procedure and legality. Ultimately, the presiding magistrate's power over the assembly was nearly absolute. The only check on that power came in the form of vetoes handed down by other magistrates.

In the Roman system of [[direct democracy]], two primary types of gatherings were used to vote on legislative, electoral, and judicial matters. The first was the Assembly (''comitia''), which was a gathering that was deemed to represent the entire Roman people, even if it did not contain all of the Roman citizens or, like the ''comitia curiata'', excluded a particular class of Roman citizens (the plebs). The second was the Council (''concilium''), which was a gathering of citizens of a specific class. In contrast, the Convention was an unofficial forum for communication. Conventions were simply forums where Romans met for specific unofficial purposes, such as, for example, to hear a political speech. Voters always assembled first into Conventions to hear debates and conduct other business before voting, and then into Assemblies or Councils to actually vote.

== Assembly procedure ==
[[Image:Platner - Ancient Rome city growth.jpg|thumb|left|Growth of the city region during the kingdom]]

There were no set dates to hold assemblies, but notice had to be given beforehand if the assembly was to be considered formal. Elections had to be announced 17 days before the election took place. Likewise, 17 days had to pass between the proposal of legislation and its enactment by an assembly.&lt;ref name="Lintott, 44"&gt;Lintott, 44&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In addition to the presiding magistrate, several additional [[magistrate]]s were often present to act as assistants.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 63"&gt;Taylor, 63&lt;/ref&gt; There were also religious officials known as [[augur]]s either in attendance or on-call, who would be available to help interpret any signs from the gods ([[omen]]s).&lt;ref name="Taylor, 63" /&gt; On several known occasions, presiding magistrates used the claim of unfavorable omens as an excuse to suspend a session that was not going the way they wanted.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 96"&gt;Taylor, 96&lt;/ref&gt; Any decision made by a presiding magistrate could be [[veto]]ed by a magistrate known as a ''[[Plebeian Tribune]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In addition, decisions made by presiding magistrates could also be vetoed by higher-ranking magistrates.

On the day of the vote, the electors first assembled into their conventions for debate and campaigning.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 2"&gt;Taylor, 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the Conventions, the electors were not sorted into their respective units (''[[curia]]'', ''[[Centuria|centuries]]'' or ''[[Roman tribe|tribes]]''). Speeches from private citizens were only heard if the issue to be voted upon was a legislative or judicial matter.&lt;ref name="Lintott, 45"&gt;Lintott, 45&lt;/ref&gt; If the purpose of the ultimate vote was for an election, no speeches from private citizens were heard, and instead, the candidates for office used the Convention to campaign.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 16"&gt;Taylor, 16&lt;/ref&gt; During the Convention, the bill to be voted upon was read to the assembly by an officer known as a "Herald". Then, if the assembly was composed of Tribes, the order of the vote had to be determined. A [[Plebeian Tribune]] could use his veto against pending legislation until the point when the order of the vote was determined.&lt;ref name="Lintott, 46"&gt;Lintott, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The electors were then told to break up the Convention and assemble into the formal Assembly or Council. The electors voted by placing a pebble or written ballot into an appropriate jar.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lintott, 46&amp;ndash;47"&gt;Lintott, 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; The baskets that held the votes were watched by specific officers, who then counted the ballots, and reported the results to the presiding magistrate. The majority of votes in any Curia, Tribe, or Century decided how that Curia, Tribe, or Century voted. Each Curia, Tribe, or Century received one vote, regardless of how many electors each Tribe or Century held. Once a majority of Curiae, Tribes, or Centuries voted in the same way on a given measure, the voting ended, and the matter was decided.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 40"&gt;Taylor, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

If a law was passed in violation of proper procedures (such as failing to wait 17 days before voting on a law), the Senate could declare the law nonbinding.&lt;ref name="Lintott, 62"&gt;Lintott, 62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assembly of the Curiae==
{{main|Curiate Assembly}}

The ''Curiate Assembly'' (''comitia curiata'') was the principal assembly during the first two decades of the [[Roman Republic]]. The Curiate Assembly was organized as an Assembly, and not as a Council even though only [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] were members. During these first decades, the People of Rome were organized into thirty units called ''[[Curia]]e''.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 33"&gt;Byrd, 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor, 3, 4"&gt;Taylor, 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; The Curiae were ethnic in nature, and thus were organized on the basis of the early Roman family, or, more specifically, on the basis of the thirty original ''[[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]]'' (aristocratic) clans.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 250"&gt;Abbott, 250&lt;/ref&gt; The Curiae assembled into the Curiate Assembly, for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. The Curiate Assembly passed laws, elected ''[[Roman Consul|Consuls]]'' (the only elected magistrates at the time),&lt;ref name="Abbott, 253"&gt;Abbott, 253&lt;/ref&gt; and tried judicial cases. Consuls always presided over the assembly.&lt;ref name="Holland, 5"&gt;Holland, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the founding of the republic, most of the powers of the Curiate Assembly were transferred to the ''[[Centuriate Assembly]]'' and the ''[[Tribal Assembly]]''.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 33" /&gt; While it then fell into disuse, it did retain some theoretical powers, most importantly, the power to ratify elections of the top-ranking [[Roman Magistrates]] (Consuls and [[Praetors]]) by passing the statute that gave them their legal command authority, the ''[[lex curiata de imperio]]''. In practice, however, they actually received this authority from the Centuriate Assembly (which formally elected them), and as such, this functioned as nothing more than a reminder of Rome's regal heritage.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 3, 4"/&gt; Other acts that the Curiate Assembly voted on were mostly symbolic and usually in the affirmative.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 3, 4"/&gt; At one point, possibly as early as 218 BC, the Curiate Assembly's thirty Curia were abolished, and replaced with thirty [[lictors]], one from each of the original [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]] clans.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 3, 4" /&gt; Since the Curia had always been organized on the basis of the Roman family,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 250" /&gt; the Curiate Assembly actually retained jurisdiction over clan matters even after the fall of the [[Roman Republic]] in 27 BC.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 253" /&gt; Under the presidency of the [[Pontifex Maximus]],&lt;ref name="Byrd, 33" /&gt; it witnessed wills and ratified adoptions,&lt;ref name="Byrd, 33" /&gt; inaugurated certain priests, and transferred citizens from Patrician class to Plebeian class (or vice versa). In 44 BC, for example, it ratified the will of [[Julius Caesar]], and with it Caesar's adoption of his nephew Gaius Octavian (the future [[Roman emperor]] [[Augustus]]) as his son and heir.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 3, 4" /&gt; However, this might not have been the ''comitia curiata'' but instead the ''[[Comitia Calata|comitia calata]]''.

The ''Centuriate Assembly'' (''comitia [[centuria]]ta'' or "Army Assembly") of the [[Roman Republic]] was originally the democratic assembly of the Roman soldiers. The Centuriate Assembly organized the Roman citizens into classes, which were defined by a means test and were economic in nature.&lt;ref name="McCullough, 943"&gt;McCullough, 943&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman army was divided into units called "Centuries", and these gathered into the Centuriate Assembly for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. However, since the number of centuries in each class was fixed, centuries could contain far more than 100 men. Only this assembly could declare war or elect the highest-ranking [[Roman Magistrates]]: ''[[Roman consul|Consuls]]'', ''[[Praetors]]'' and ''[[Roman Censor|Censors]]''.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 257"&gt;Abbott, 257&lt;/ref&gt; The Centuriate Assembly could also pass a statute that granted constitutional command authority to Consuls and Praetors, and Censorial powers to Censors.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 257" /&gt; In addition, the Centuriate Assembly served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases, and ratified the results of the Census.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 3, 4" /&gt; While the voters in this assembly wore white undecorated togas and were unarmed, while taking part in the Assembly they were classified as soldiers, and as such they could not meet inside of the [[pomerium|physical boundary of the city of Rome]].&lt;ref name="Abbott, 257" /&gt; The president of the Centuriate Assembly was usually a Consul (although sometimes a Praetor). Only Consuls (the highest-ranking of all Roman Magistrates) could preside over the Centuriate Assembly during elections because the higher-ranking Consuls were always elected together with the lower-ranking Praetors. Once every five years, after the new Consuls for the year took office, they presided over the Centuriate Assembly as it elected the two Censors.

The Centuriate Assembly was supposedly founded by the legendary [[Roman King]] [[Servius Tullius]], less than a century before the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 BC. As such, the original design of the Centuriate Assembly was known as the "[[Servian constitution|Servian organization]]". Under this organization, the assembly was supposedly designed to mirror the Roman army during the time of the [[Roman Kingdom]]. Soldiers in the Roman army were classified on the basis of the amount of property that they owned, and as such, soldiers with more property had more influence than soldiers with less property. The 193 Centuries in the assembly under the Servian Organization were each divided into one of three different grades: the officer class, the enlisted class, and a class of unarmed adjuncts.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 85"&gt;Taylor, 85&lt;/ref&gt; The officer class was grouped into eighteen Centuries.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 85" /&gt; The enlisted class was grouped into five separate property classes, for a total of 170 Centuries.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 87"&gt;Taylor, 87&lt;/ref&gt; The unarmed soldiers were divided into the final five Centuries.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 21"&gt;Abbott, 21&lt;/ref&gt; Of five enlisted classes, the wealthiest controlled 80 of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;E. S. Staveley. ''Greek and Roman Voting and Elections''. Cornell University Press, 1972 pg. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; During a vote, all of the Centuries of one class had to vote before the Centuries of the next lower class could vote.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 86"&gt;Taylor, 86&lt;/ref&gt; The first candidate to reach a majority of 97 votes was victorious.  When a measure or candidate received 97 votes, a majority of the centuries, the voting ended, and as such, many lower ranking Centuries rarely if ever had a chance to actually vote. Combined the 18 equites and the 80 centuries of the first property class had one more century than needed, and a unanimous vote from the elite would thus elect a candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Feig Vishnia. ''Roman Elections in the Age of Cicero: Society, Government, and Voting.'' Routledge, Mar 12, 2012 pg. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman constitution.png|thumb|right|Chart Showing the Checks and Balances of the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic]]]]

In 241 BC, the assembly was reorganized, though the exact details are uncertain. Some sources have a new total of 373 Centuries,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 75"&gt;Abbott, 75&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Cicero]] still writes of 193 centuries in his era, and most scholars still use that number&lt;ref&gt;E. S. Staveley. ''Greek and Roman Voting and Elections''. Cornell University Press, 1972 pg. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; It known that the first property class was reduced form 80 to 70 centuries, and the order of voting was changed so that the first class would go first, and be followed by the equites.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Feig Vishnia. ''Roman Elections in the Age of Cicero: Society, Government, and Voting.'' Routledge, Mar 12, 2012 pg. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The lowest ranking Century in the Centuriate Assembly was the fifth Century (called the ''proletarii'') of the unarmed adjunct class. This Century was the only Century composed of soldiers who had no property, and since it was always the last Century to vote, it never had any real influence on elections. In 107 BC, in response to high unemployment and a severe manpower shortage in the army, the general and Consul [[Gaius Marius]] [[Marian reforms|reformed the organization of the army]], and allowed individuals with no property to enlist. As a consequence of these reforms, this fifth unarmed Century came to encompass almost the entire Roman army.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 86" /&gt; This mass disenfranchisement of most of the soldiers in the army played an important role in the chaos that led to the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 86" /&gt;

During his [[Roman Dictator|dictatorship]] from 82 BC until 80 BC, [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] restored the old Servian Organization to this assembly. Sulla died in 78 BC, and in 70 BC, the Consuls [[Pompey|Pompey Magnus]] and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] repealed Sulla's constitutional reforms, including his restoration of the Servian Organization to this assembly. Thus, they restored the newer organization that had originated in 241 BC. The organization of the Centuriate Assembly was not changed again until its powers were all transferred to the [[Roman Senate]] by the first [[Roman Emperor]], [[Augustus]], after the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 107"&gt;Abbott, 107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assembly of the Tribes==
{{main|Tribal Assembly}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Gaius Gracchus Flees.jpg|thumb|right|Gaius Gracchus flees after failing to win reelection to the tribunate]] --&gt;
The ''Tribal Assembly'' (''comitia populi tributa'') of the [[Roman Republic]] was the democratic assembly of Roman citizens. The Tribal Assembly was organized as an Assembly, and not as a Council. During the years of the Roman Republic, citizens were organized on the basis of thirty-five Tribes which included patricians and plebeians. The Tribes gathered into the Tribal Assembly for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. The president of the Tribal Assembly was usually either a ''[[Roman consul|Consul]]'' (the highest ranking [[Roman Magistrate]]) or a ''[[Praetor]]'' (the second-highest ranking Roman Magistrate). The Tribal Assembly elected three different magistrates: ''[[Quaestor]]s'', ''[[aedile|Curule Aediles]]'', and ''[[tribune|Military Tribunes]]''.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 7"&gt;Taylor, 7&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribal Assembly also had the power to try judicial cases.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 261"&gt;Abbott, 261&lt;/ref&gt;

The thirty-five Tribes were not ethnic or kinship groups, but rather a generic division into which Roman citizens were distributed. When the Tribes were created the divisions were geographical, similar to modern [[Parliamentary constituencies]]. However, since one joined the same Tribe that one's father belonged to, the geographical distinctions were eventually lost.&lt;ref name="Lintott, 51"&gt;Lintott, 51&lt;/ref&gt; The order that the 35 Tribes voted in was selected randomly by lot. The order was not chosen at once, and after each Tribe had voted, a lot was used to determine which Tribe should vote next.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 77"&gt;Taylor, 77&lt;/ref&gt; The first Tribe selected was usually the most important Tribe, because it often decided the matter. It was believed that the order of the lot was chosen by the Gods, and thus, that the position held by the early voting Tribes was the position of the Gods.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 76"&gt;Taylor, 76&lt;/ref&gt; Once a majority of Tribes had voted the same way, voting ended.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 40" /&gt;

==Plebeian Council==
{{main|Plebeian Council}}
The ''Plebeian Council'' (''concilium plebis'') was the principal popular gathering of the [[Roman Republic]]. As the name suggests, the Plebeian Council was organized as a Council, and not as an Assembly. It functioned as a gathering through which the [[Plebeian]]s (commoners) could pass laws, elect magistrates, and try judicial cases. This council had no political power until the offices of ''[[tribune|Plebeian Tribune]]'' and ''[[aedile|Plebeian Aedile]]'' were created in 494 BC, due to the ''[[secessio|Plebeian Secession]]'' that year.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 261" /&gt;

According to legend, the [[Roman King]] [[Servius Tullius]] enacted a series of constitutional reforms in the 6th century BC. One of these reforms resulted in the creation of a new organizational unit with which to divide citizens. This unit, the ''Tribe'', was based on geography rather than family, and was created to assist in future reorganizations of the [[Roman army|army]].&lt;ref name="Abbott, 21" /&gt; In 471 BC,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 196"&gt;Abbott, 196&lt;/ref&gt; a law was passed which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Before this point, they had organized on the basis of the ''Curia''.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 261" /&gt; The only difference between the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary ''[[Tribal Assembly]]'' (which also organized on the basis of the Tribes) was that the Tribes of the Plebeian Council only included Plebeians, whereas the Tribes of the Tribal Assembly included both Plebeians and Patricians.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 261" /&gt;

The Plebeian Council elected two 'Plebeian Magistrates', the ''Plebeian Tribunes'' and the ''Plebeian Aediles''.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 196" /&gt; Usually the Plebeian Tribune presided over the assembly, although the Plebeian Aedile sometimes did as well. Originally, statutes passed by the Plebeian Council ("[[Plebiscites]]") only applied to Plebeians.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 31"&gt;Byrd, 31&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 449 BC, a statute of an Assembly was passed which gave Plebiscites the full force of law over all Romans (Plebeians and Patricians).&lt;ref name="Abbott, 51"&gt;Abbott, 51&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 287 BC, however, that the last mechanism which allowed the [[Roman Senate]] to [[veto]] acts of the Plebeian Council was revoked. After this point, almost all domestic legislation came out of the Plebeian Council.

==Fiction==
These films are about fictional events.  They are selected on the criteria based on either (1) the plots involve the use of actual or fictitious terror groups and events, or (2) the overall storyline incorporates the essence of a terror attack.  (i.e. ''Goldfinger'' ''(1964)'' was not a terror attack on Ft. Knox, but rather a means for financial gains.  ''Thunderball (1965)'', although is also based on financial gains, the plot involved the use of ransom and terror to achieve this goal.)

'''Lok Adalat''' (People's Court) is one of the [[Alternative dispute resolution]] mechanisms in India, it is a forum where cases pending or at pre litigation stage in a court of law  are settled. They have been given statutory status under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. Under this Act, the award (decision) made by the Lok Adalats is deemed to be a decree of a civil court and is final and binding on all parties and no appeal against such an award lies before any court of law. If the parties are not satisfied with the award of the Lok Adalat (though there is no provision for an appeal against such an award), they are free to initiate litigation by approaching the court of appropriate jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;https://nalsa.gov.in/lok-adalat&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first lok adalat was held in Gujarat in 1982.
* First time held in Chennai in 1986.
* Accepts cases pending in regular court under their jurisdiction.
* The Lok Adalat are presided over by Members of Lok Adalat; they have the role of statutory conciliators only and do not have any judicial role, therefore they can only persuade the parties to come to a settlement
* Main condition of the Lok Adalat is that both parties in dispute should agree for settlement. 
* There is no court fee and if a matter pending in the court of law is referred to the Lok Adalat and is settled subsequently, the court fee originally paid in the court on the complaints/petition is also refunded back to the parties.
* The procedural laws and the [[Indian Evidence Act|Evidence Act]] are not strictly followed while assessing the merits of the claim by the Lok Adalat.
* The decision of the Lok Adalat is binding on the parties to the dispute and its order is capable of execution through legal process.

Lok Adalat is very effective in settlement of money claims. Disputes like partition suits, [[damages]] and [[Matrimonial law|matrimonial]] cases can also be easily settled before Lok Adalat, as the scope for compromise through an approach of give and take is high in these cases. A Lok Adalat can take up civil cases (including marriage, and family disputes) and compoundable criminal cases.

'''Lucjan Żeligowski''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈlut͡sjan ʐɛliˈɡɔfskʲi}}; 1865–1947) was a [[Poles|Polish]] [[general]], politician, military commander and veteran of [[World War I]], the [[Polish-Soviet War]] and [[World War II]]. He is mostly remembered for his role in  [[Żeligowski's Mutiny]] and as head of a short-lived [[Republic of Central Lithuania]].

==Biography==
Lucjan Żeligowski was born on October 17, 1865, in [[Oszmiana]], in the [[Russian Empire]] (modern [[Ashmiany]] in [[Belarus]]) to Polish parents Gustaw Żeligowski and Władysława Żeligowska née Traczewska. Before the [[Partitions of Poland]] in the late 18th century the town was part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. After graduating from military officers' school located in [[Riga]] (1885), Żeligowski joined the [[Imperial Russian Army]], where he served at various staff and command posts. He then married Tatiana Pietrowna and had two children.
 
Żeligowski fought in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-1905. During the [[First World War]] he served as a [[lieutenant colonel]] and commanding officer of an Imperial Russian rifle regiment.

===Fighting against the Bolsheviks===
After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, Żeligowski became one of the organizers of the [[Polish Army]] in the former [[Russian Empire]]. Initially commander of an infantry regiment in the ranks of the [[Polish I Corps in Russia|Polish 1st Corps]], he was quickly promoted and given command over a brigade. In 1918 he started the creation of a Polish unit in the area of [[Kuban]], which eventually became the [[4th Polish Rifle Division]]. As part of the Polish Army, his unit fought alongside the [[Anton Denikin|Denikin's]] [[White movement|Whites]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]. In October of the same year he became the Commander in Chief of all the Polish units fighting in Russia.

After the outbreak of the [[Polish-Bolshevik War]] and the defeat of Denikin, Żeligowski's unit was ordered to retreat to [[Romania]]n [[Bessarabia]], where it took part in defence of the border against [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] raids. Finally, in April 1919, the division was withdrawn to the newly established [[Second Polish Republic]], where it was incorporated into the Polish Army and renamed to [[Polish 10th Infantry Division]].

During the [[Polish-Bolshevik War|war against the Bolshevist Russia]], Żeligowski, a personal friend of Polish Marshal [[Józef Piłsudski]], was quickly promoted to general and given the command over an [[operational group]] of his name, composed of his 10th division and additional units, mostly of partisan origin. As such, he soon became the commanding officer of the entire ''Lithuanian-Belarusian Front'', operating in the area of [[Polesie]] and the [[Pinsk Marshes]]. During the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] in 1920 his unit was attached to the 3rd Polish Army and took part in the pursuit of fleeing Bolshevik and Soviet forces at the [[Battle of the Niemen River|Battle of the Niemen]].

===Republic of Central Lithuania===
[[File:Portret-general-broni-lucjan-zeligowski-8230-mal-r-kawecki,340,duzy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lucjan Żeligowski, 1932]]
[[File:Herb Łabędź 1.svg|thumb|90px|right|Żeligowski's family coat-of-arms, ''[[Łabędź coat of arms|Łabędź]]'' ("Swan").]]
In October 1920, Żeligowski, a native of [[Lithuania proper|historical lands of Lithuania]], was chosen to command the [[1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Infantry Division]], composed mainly of [[Polska Organizacja Wojskowa|P.O.W.]] members, volunteers and partisans from the territory of modern Belarus and Lithuania. On October 8, 1920, after [[Żeligowski's Rebellion|a staged coup]], he defected with his unit and took control over the city of [[Wilno]] (modern-day Vilnius) and its area. The coup, named after him, would be remembered as the defining moments of his life. On October 12 he proclaimed independence of the said area as Republic of Central Lithuania, with Wilno as its capital. Initially a ''de facto'' military dictator, after the parliamentary elections he passed his powers to the newly elected [[Sejm|parliament]], which in turn decided to submit the area to [[Poland]].

===Later life===
After the annexation of Central Lithuania to Poland, Żeligowski continued his service in the Polish Army. Promoted to [[three-star general]] in 1923, he served as an ''army inspector'', or a commander of a military district of the capital city of [[Warsaw]]. In 1925 he also became the Polish [[Minister of Military Affairs]]. Ousted by Piłsudski's [[coup d'état]] (the [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]]), he was soon returned to the post. He retired the following year and settled in his family manor in Andrzejewo near [[Wilno]].

In 1930 he published a book containing his memoirs of the Polish-Bolshevik War named ''War of 1920: Memories and thoughts'' (''Wojna w roku 1920. Wspomnienia i rozważania''). He also wrote numerous articles on the conflicts of early 20th century for a variety of Polish newspapers. In 1935 he was elected a [[member of parliament]] and remained in the [[Sejm]] until the outbreak of World War II in 1939.

====World War II and death====
During the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Invasion of Poland]], Żeligowski volunteered for the [[Polish Armed Forces]], but was not accepted due to his old age (he was 74 at that time) and poor health. Nevertheless, he served as an advisor to the command of the Polish southern front. After the Polish defeat, he evaded being captured by the Germans and the Soviets and managed to reach France, where he joined the [[Polish Government in Exile]] headed by General [[Władysław Sikorski]]. An active member of the ''Polish National Council'', an advisory body, he escaped to [[London]] after the [[Battle of France|French defeat]] in 1940.

After the end of [[Second World War]] Żeligowski declared he would return to Poland, but he suddenly died on July 9, 1947, in London. His body was brought back to Poland, and Żeligowski was buried in the [[Powązki Military Cemetery]] in Warsaw.

The title '''Man of Peace''' was created in 1999 by the annual [[World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates]] in [[Rome]]. The purpose of the award is to recognize individuals who "from personalities from the world of culture and entertainment who have stood up for human rights and for the spread of the principles of Peace and Solidarity in the world, made an outstanding contribution to international social justice and peace".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobelforpeace-summits.org/peace-summit-award/ The Peace Summit Award]&lt;/ref&gt;

An initiative by former Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], himself a winner of a [[Nobel Peace Prize]], the award is presented in Rome's Campidoglio ([[Capitoline Hill]]) by President Gorbachev, [[Walter Veltroni]], Mayor of Rome, and the Nobel Peace Prize Laureates attending the annual summit meeting. 

In its early years the award was referred to as both the "Man for Peace" in Europe and "Man of Peace" in the United States. In 2006 its title was officially changed to "Man of Peace", also "[[Peace Summit Award]]".

'''May First/People Link (MF/PL)''' is a [[non-profit]] [[membership organization]] that uses [[Mutual aid (politics)|mutual aid]] to provide [[Internet]] services, such as [[web hosting]] to progressive organizations and individuals. Founded in 1995 and based in [[New York City]], MF/PL is one of the Internet's oldest progressive organizations. A member of [[Association for Progressive Communications]], MF/PL directors, leaders, and members agree upon principles of progressive use of technology, outlined by a Statement of Unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://mayfirst.org/unity |title=Statement of Unity |publisher=May First/People Link |date= |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the MF/PL website:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...an organization that redefines the concept of "Internet Service Provider" in a collective, progressive and collaborative way. The members of May First/People Link are like a coop: we pay dues, buy equipment and then we all use that equipment as we need to for websites, email, email lists, and just about everything else we do on the Internet...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
May First/People Link, Local 1180 CWA [[AFL-CIO]] members, was formed from the merge between two progressive providers in 2005. People Link began providing organizations with hosting in 1995. May First Technology Collective supported progressive organizations' technology needs in 1999. MF/PL's history as one of the world's oldest and largest politically progressive [[Information and communication technologies]] (ICTs) began in support of [[alternative media]] during the years leading up to the [[anti-globalization movement]].

==Leadership==
The current co-directors of May First/People Link are [[Alfredo Lopez]] and [[Jamie McClelland]]. Founding members and other members of MF/PL leadership are represented by organizations including The Praxis Project, [[NACLA]], [[Progressive Technology Project]], and The [[Brecht Forum]].

==Membership==
Notable MF/PL members include [[The Yes Men]], [[Independent Media Center]]s, [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]], and ''[[Left Turn]]'' magazine. Over 500 members represent organizations such as [[food cooperative]]s, [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] networks, [[grassroots]] organizations, unions, and schools.

==Projects==
MF/PL organized collaborative technology for the 2009 [[World Social Forum]] in [[Belem, Brazil]]. For the [[United States Social Forum]], MF/PL was included in the leadership of technology organizing for [[Atlanta, Georgia]] in 2007 and National Planning Committee members for the Information, Communications, and Technology working group leading up to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]'s event in 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4549">'''Michel Roussin''' (born May 3, 1939 in [[Rabat]], [[Morocco]]) was the chief of staff of [[Alexandre de Marenches]], who directed the [[Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage|SDECE French secret service]] until the May 1981 election of [[François Mitterrand]] as President of [[France]]. Michel Roussin has also been chief of staff of [[Jacques Chirac]] when he was mayor of [[Paris]] and also when he was prime minister.

Roussin then became minister of cooperation under [[Edouard Balladur]]'s government. However, he had to resign, in accordance with the so-called [[Balladur jurisprudence]] because of suspected involvement in various affairs concerning the illegal funding of Chirac's [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR) party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Michel Roussin mis en examen | publisher=[[L'Humanité]] | date=November 15, 1994 | url=https://www.humanite.fr/journal/1994-11-15/1994-11-15-712083|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jailed for a time, Roussin was afterwards acquitted. However, on October 26, 2005, he was condemned to four years of prison on probation and a 50,000 EUR fine for his role in the [[Corruption scandals in the Paris region|corruption affair concerning high schools in the Paris region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Michel Giraud, Michel Roussin, Louise-Yvonne Casetta, Guy Drut...: jugés coupables | publisher=Libération | date=October 26, 2005 | url=http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=333857|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=

Named to the direction of [[SAE International]], a construction firm linked to [[Paribas]] bank, Roussin in 1997 followed this function with his presidency of the Africa committee of the [[MEDEF]], the French employers organization;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medefinternational.fr/afrique_prog.html Medef Africa program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720110830/http://www.medefinternational.fr/afrique_prog.html |date=2006-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[francophonie]]'' delegation at Paris's municipal hall. He also presented himself as candidate to the presidency of the [[Elf Aquitaine]] oil company. Roussin is also allegedly a member of the [[free masonry|masonic lodge]] ''[[Grande Loge Nationale Française]]'' (GLNF).

The Ministry was first created in 2000 through a merger of the [[Ministry of Agriculture (Austria)|Ministry of Agriculture]] (''Landwirtschaftsministerium'') and the [[Ministry of Environment (Austria)|Ministry of Environment]] (''Umweltministerium''); it gained responsibility for the energy sector, mining, and tourism under the [[Kurz government|Kurz cabinet]] in 2018.

== History ==

The Ministry's earliest precursor was the [[Cisleithania]]n [[Ministry of Agriculture (Austria)|Ministry of Agriculture]] (''Ackerbauministerium''), created in 1867. In additional to agriculture, the Ministry was responsible for regulating hunting, fishing, and hydraulic engineering, excluding hydraulic engineering of military importance.&lt;ref name="m1"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bmnt.gv.at/ministerium/geschichte-LM/geschichteLM.html | title = Geschichte des Ministeriums | accessdate = 2018-05-06 | date = January 16, 2018 | publisher = BMNT | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="geschichte"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bmnt.gv.at/ministerium/geschichte-LM/150-jahre-landwirtschaftsministerium.html | title = 150 Jahre Landwirtschaftsminiterium | accessdate = 2018-05-06 | date = April 4, 2018 | language = German | publisher = BMNT }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The organization was renamed to Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (''Ministerium für Land- und Forstwirtschaft'') in 1918 and was briefly called a department (''Staatsamt'') rather than a ministry during the two periods of constitutional transition following the two World Wars. Except for the name, however, the Ministry survived mostly in its original form until 2000.

In 1972, Austria established the [[Ministry of Health (Austria)|Ministry of Health and the Environment]] (''Ministerium für Gesundheit und Umweltschutz'', usually called ''Gesundheitsministerium'' or ''Umweltministerium'' for short). In 1987, family affairs were added to its portfolio, turning it into the Ministry of Environment, Youth and Family Affairs (''Ministerium für Umwelt, Jugend und Familie'') &lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bmnt.gv.at/english/ministry/History-of-the-Ministry/History-of-the-Ministry.html | title = History of the Ministry | accessdate = 2018-05-06 | publisher = BMNT | date = January 16, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the two ministries were combined to form the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management (''Ministerium für Land- und Forstwirtschaft, Umwelt und Wasserwirtschaft'', although often called ''Lebensministerium'').&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Responsibility for family affairs was moved to the Ministry of Social Affairs (''Sozialministerium'') at the time.

When the [[Kurz government|Kurz cabinet]] took office in December 2017, the ministry was put in charge of the energy sector, mining, and tourism in addition to its existing powers and duties; it also gained its current designation.&lt;ref name="geschichte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="angelobt"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://diepresse.com/home/innenpolitik/5349890/Acht-Minister-erneut-angelobt | title = Acht Minister neu angelobt | publisher = Die Presse | language = German | date = January 8, 2018 | accessdate = 2018-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The additional responsibilities created an institution with exceptionally broad authority; the new ministry has been described as a "super ministry" (''Superministerium'') &lt;ref name="supermin"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/5356687/Warum-Landwirtschaft-im-Superministerium-von-Koestinger-keinen | title = Warum Landwirtschaft im Superministerium von Köstinger keinen Platz hat | date = January 19, 2018 | accessdate = 2018-05-06 | publisher = Die Presse | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "behemoth" (''Riese''); the cabinet had difficulties finding a new name that would adequately reflect its extensive purview, the present minister has noted.&lt;ref name="supermin"/&gt;
The move was not completely uncontroversial.&lt;ref name="unmut"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://diepresse.com/home/innenpolitik/5339713/Kurz-Minister_Wie-sie-wurden-was-sie-nun-sind | accessdate = 2016-05-08 | date = December 16, 2017 | title = Kurz' Minister: Wie sie wurden, was sie nun sind | publisher = Die Presse | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Agrarian Party''' ({{lang-ro|Partidul Național-Agrar}} or ''Partidul Național-Agrarian'', PNA) was a right-wing [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] party active in [[Romania]] during the early 1930s. Established and led by poet [[Octavian Goga]], it was originally a schism from the more moderate [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]], espousing [[national conservatism]], [[monarchism]], [[agrarianism]], [[antisemitism]], and [[Germanophilia]]; Goga was also positively impressed by [[fascism]], but there is disagreement in the scholarly community as to whether the PNA was itself fascist. Its antisemitic rhetoric was also contrasted by the PNA's acceptance of some [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] members, including [[Tudor Vianu]] and [[Henric Streitman]]. The group was generally suspicious of Romania's other [[Minorities of Romania|ethnic minorities]], but in practice accepted members and external collaborators of many ethnic backgrounds, including the [[romani people in Romania|Romani]] [[Gheorghe A. Lăzăreanu-Lăzurică]].

The National Agrarianist economic and social program rested on the protection of [[Smallholding|smallholders]], with echoes of [[dirigisme]] and promises of [[debt relief]]. It was strongly opposed to the more left-wing [[National Peasants' Party]], describing it as corrupt and denouncing its autonomist-regionalist tendencies. In [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], PNA representatives, largely inherited from the People's Party, collaborated mostly with two other anti-establishment groups: the [[National Liberal Party-Brătianu|Georgist Liberals]] and the [[Peasants' Party–Lupu|Lupist Peasantists]]. The PNA was able to absorb some National Peasantist sections, primarily in [[Bucharest]] and [[Transylvania]].

The PNA registered its best result nationally in the [[Romanian general election, 1933|December 1933 election]], when it took 4.1% of the vote. Despite its relative insignificance, its leader Goga was often perceived as a likely contender for the office of [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]]. The PNA had contacts in [[Nazi Germany]], who regarded it as a political ally. While cautious about the Nazis' take on international politics, Goga traveled to [[Berlin]] in late 1933, meeting [[Adolf Hitler]] and returning as an enthusiastic admirer. Moving closer to the [[far-right]] and abandoning his own membership in the [[Freemasonry in Romania|Romanian Freemasonry]], Goga sought alliances with the more radical movements. The PNA tried but failed to unite with the [[Iron Guard]] and the [[Romanian Front]], finally merging with the slightly more powerful [[National-Christian Defense League]] in July 1935. 

The resulting [[National Christian Party]] offered a venue for conservative antisemites with fascist sympathies, but was rejected by PNA moderates, as well as by some of the League's radicals. A splinter group, led by [[Ion Al. Vasilescu-Valjean]] and centered on [[Romanați County]], continued to call itself PNA, surviving to at least 1937.

==History==
===Emergence===
The party emerged with a split in the more mainstream People's Party (PP), which was led by General [[Alexandru Averescu]]. This followed a major dispute between Averescu and Goga, prompted by the latter's unconditional support for Romania's authoritarian [[King of the Romanians|King]], [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]. Historian Adolf Minuț argues that Carol personally intervened to create a rift between the two men, this being one of a "web of Carlist machinations" to isolate his constitutionalist adversaries.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), pp. 267–268&lt;/ref&gt; The same is noted by memoirist Vasile Netea, who describes Carol as performing "[[Fission (biology)|scissiparity]]" on the old parties.&lt;ref&gt;Netea, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1932, Goga had vaguely announced his bid for the PP chairmanship, while also hinting that he was prepared to leave with his partisans if his candidacy were to be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), pp. 268–269&lt;/ref&gt; On March 3, Averescu formally denounced Goga's maneuvers in a circular letter to regional affiliates, noting that a conspiracy was in place to break up the PP.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Goga accused Averescu of tarnishing the crown's prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), p. 269; Moldovan, pp. 273–275&lt;/ref&gt; 

The split also consecrated the independence of Goga's faction of the PP, which was also situated on the extreme of [[Romanian nationalism]], with "some sympathies toward fascism".&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; However, the new group was also able to absorb more moderate sections of the PP, leaving Averescu's group severely weakened.&lt;ref&gt;Butaru, p. 102; Netea, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Averescu and his colleague, [[Grigore Trancu-Iași]], fought back by asking for all dissidents still holding seats in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]] to be deposed. This proposal was eventually defeated by a vote, during which the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] voted in Goga's favor.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

Goga's party originated with a PP congress at Enescu restaurant on March 12, attended by 45 of 65 sections, which proclaimed Goga as People's Party chairman. By March 21, Averescu was able to regain control over most PP chapters, though he lost all presence in places such as [[Argeș County|Argeș]], [[Cluj County|Cluj]], and [[Mehedinți County|Mehedinți]].&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Following this confrontation, Goga announced he would take on the "painful task" of leaving Averescu's group.&lt;ref&gt;Moldovan, pp. 274–275&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by scholar Armin Heinen, the National Agrarians' genesis coincided with the parallel rise of the [[Nazi Party]] in [[Weimar Germany]]: the PNA began organizing during [[German presidential election, 1932|Weimar's presidential election]], in which [[Adolf Hitler]] came second.&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; 

Goga's "general staff" included former minister [[Ion Petrovici]], alongside [[Ion Al. Vasilescu-Valjean]] and C. Brăescu, who had been Vice Presidents of the Deputies' Assembly.&lt;ref name="trrturt"&gt;Tr. R., "Știri—Note—Comentarii. Marea întrunire Național-Agrară ținută la Turtucaia", in ''Farul'', Issue 14/1933, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Three other prominent Averescu supporters, [[Leon Scridon]],&lt;ref&gt;Moldovan, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silviu Dragomir]] and [[Ioan Lupaș]],&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), pp. 273, 274; Nastasă, p. 87. See also Netea, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; also joined Goga during his departure. Early defectors also included a large part of the PP eminences in [[Transylvania]] and the [[Banat]]: Eugen P. Barbul, Sebastian Bornemisa, Laurian Gabor, and Petru Nemoianu.&lt;ref&gt;Netea, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; This remained "the most painful" of all schisms endured by the PP.&lt;ref name="hchm197"&gt;Hans-Christian Maner, "Despre elite și partide politice din România interbelică", in Vasile Ciobanu, Sorin Radu (eds.), ''Partide politice și minorități naționale din România în secolul XX'', Vol. III, p. 197. Sibiu: TechnoMedia, 2008.  {{isbn|978-973-739-261-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, 1932, this dissidence held its congress at Rio Cinema, [[Bucharest]]. Its first presidium included Lupaș, General [[Constantin Iancovescu]], [[Stan Ghițescu]], Ilie Rădulescu, and Iancu Isvoranu; Goga was reconfirmed as People's Party chairman, before the party changed names.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; The "PNA" name was adopted hours later, following a motion submitted by deputy D. D. Burileanu—having been first submitted for discussion a week earlier, during a more private meeting of party leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), pp. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; The group registered as its electoral symbol "two dots within a circumference",&lt;ref&gt;Radu, p. 578&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes described as a circle with "two eyes".&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), p. 274; Netea, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; Whether intentionally or not, this symbol closely resembled the circle used by a more democratic agrarian group, the [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ).&lt;ref&gt;Radu, pp. 578–579&lt;/ref&gt; Transylvanian defectors from the PNȚ initially organized some of the PNA branches, but, in June 1932, returned to their old party.&lt;ref&gt;"Conștiința Ardealului. Glasul vremii îndreaptă lumea pe calea adevărului", in ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'', Issue 50/1932, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; More dedicated support came from the former PNȚ chapters in [[Ilfov County]] and the "Black" (northeastern) [[Sectors of Bucharest|sector of Bucharest]], which were absorbed into Goga's new movement.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; 

PNA cadres included four important figures in Romania's commercial and industrial life, who, as Netea writes, were especially treasured by Goga. These were Ghițescu, [[Tilică Ioanid]], I. D. Enescu, and Leon Gigurtu.&lt;ref&gt;Netea, pp. 249–250&lt;/ref&gt; The group also reached out of its PP constituency, and had traction among people not previously involved in party politics, such as [[Virgil Molin]], a journalist and president of the [[Craiova]] chamber of labor.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Gagea, "Virgil Molin – un tipograf și ziarist de excepție (27 nov. 1898 – 28 ian. 1968)", in ''Biblioteca Bucureștilor'', Issue 11/1998, pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; Also joining the PNA were the literary critic [[Tudor Vianu]]&lt;ref name="boia"&gt;[[Lucian Boia]], ''Capcanele istoriei. Elita intelectuală românească între 1930 și 1950'', pp. 102–103. Bucharest: [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], 2012.  {{isbn|978-973-50-3533-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his brother, the essayist Alexandru Vianu, alongside poet [[Sandu Tudor]] and philosopher [[Alexandru Mironescu]].&lt;ref name="emvianu"&gt;Emilia Motoranu, "Un scriitor uitat: Alexandru Vianu", in ''Sud. Revistă Editată de Asociația pentru Cultură și Tradiție Istorică Bolintineanu'', Issues 1–2/2016, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Țara Noastră]]'', put out from Transylvania by [[Ion Gorun]], endured as the central party organ, with another party newspaper of the same name appearing at [[Buzău]].&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; While establishing itself regionally, Goga's party took over or established several regional newspapers: ''Cuvântul Poporului'', put out by Elie Mărgeanu of [[Sibiu]]; ''Agrarul Vâlcei'', published by Dumitru Zeana in [[Râmnicu Vâlcea]]; ''Cârma Vremii'' of [[Iași]] and ''Chemarea'' of [[Vaslui]]; as well as two sheets in [[Brăila]] and [[Constanța]], both named ''Brazda Nouă''.&lt;ref&gt;Ileana-Stanca Desa, Elena Ioana Mălușanu, Cornelia Luminița Radu, Iuliana Sulică, ''Publicațiile periodice românești (ziare, gazete, reviste).

===Platform===
====Conservatism, radicalism, agrarianism====
As Heinen notes, the PNA was one of several groups channeling popular discontent following the [[Great Depression]]; it was also the most authentic, and a "remarkable force."&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Stanley G. Payne]] describes the splinter group as authoritarian nationalist and "rightist", or "rather more overtly right radical" than [[Mihail Manoilescu]]'s own dissident faction.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, pp. 279, 284&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of its labeling has caused some disputes in the community of experts. [[Nicholas Nagy-Talavera]] viewed Goga as a "bourgeois fascist", but his assessment was challenged by Heinen, according to whom the PNA's "radical nationalism" was "entirely devoid of that revolutionary pathos which set apart all the fascist parties."&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, "too many PNA members were still tied to the People's Party directives in both manners and ideas of political combat."&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to scholar [[Irina Livezeanu]], Goga was in the process of migrating "across the conservative-radical divide".&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; 

While reaching out to the far-right, the PNA was also staunchly monarchist—according to Heinen, Goga was a "[[National conservatism|national conservative]]" among the "Carlists".&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, pp. 142–143, 175&lt;/ref&gt; The National Agrarians adopted ''Dumnezeu, Patrie, Rege'' ("God, Fatherland, King") as their slogan, a rallying cry already associated with Goga before the party's formation.&lt;ref&gt;Levy ''et al.'', p. 279; Veiga, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; The group's rejection of democracy had its roots in Goga's 1927 book, ''Mustul care fierbe'' ("The Frothing Must"), which argued that the masses needed a "moral eminence" to "inspire in them tranquility and safety."&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; The PNA suggested modifying Romania's [[1923 Constitution of Romania|Constitution of 1923]], reducing [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] to an "orderly and useful instrument", reformed around a [[Corporatism|corporative representation]].&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (2001), p. 427&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, the PNA adopted another slogan: ''Rod mult, bun și cu preț'' ("More, better, valuable bearings"). This notion reflected its commitment to an agrarian economy, which Goga identified as the core of Romania's potential for export, in tandem with the [[Romanianization]] of labor and capital.&lt;ref name="algh1"&gt;[[Al. Gherghel]], "Octavian Goga și partidul său", in ''Farul'', Issue 18/1933, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; Goga's agrarianism rested on the notion that peasants were a unifying factor, their shared culture transcending regional divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p. 160; Minuț (2001), pp. 424–425&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, Valjean similarly proclaimed that all classes were "subordinate to the plowmen".&lt;ref name="botar"&gt;Dumitru Botar, "Din presa romanațeană de altădată (III)", in ''Memoria Oltului și Romanaților'', Issue 4/2017, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; His PNA intended to make the smallholders key players in Romania's economy, encouraging [[credit union]]s and land purchase, as well as describing a future in which labor and its product would be more expensive; it also promised to enact agricultural [[dirigisme]], with tools such as a state plan for developing agriculture, [[pomology]], [[sericulture]], and handicrafts.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), pp. 270–271 &amp; (2001), pp. 425, 427&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Mustul care fierbe VR 10, 33.jpg|thumb|300px|Goga acknowledging his thirst for "frothing must", as the prelude to a "great agitation", in an imaginary interview. Cartoon published by the left-wing review ''[[Viața Românească]]'' in 1933]]
While seeking ways to improve the peasants' economic status, the party pledged itself to administrative reform and a full clampdown on corruption.&lt;ref name="hchm197"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; By October 1932, its deputies were engaged in a public confrontation with the PNȚ cabinet, headed by [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]], over the issue of [[debt relief]]. Goga wanted most of the small- and mid-sized plots to be cleared of debt with state support, and wanted to extend that principle to public debt held by urban localities.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (2001), pp. 425, 427&lt;/ref&gt; Such proposals were balanced out by the PNA's adversity toward decentralizing projects, in which Goga saw evidence of pushes for Transylvanian autonomism, as endorsed by the PNȚ.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (2001), p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Oltea Rășcanu Gramaticu, who focused on the politics of [[Tutova County]], noted that the PNA enjoyed "some popularity", due to its "radical solutions for revitalizing small plots owned by the peasants".&lt;ref&gt;Oltea Rășcanu Gramaticu, "Viața politică interbelică în județul Tutova", in ''Acta Moldaviae Meridionalis'', Vol. XXXVI, 2015, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; However, as argued by researchers Cornel Popescu and George Daniel Ungureanu, the PNA was agrarian "in name", and had a mostly right-wing program.&lt;ref&gt;Cornel Popescu, George Daniel Ungureanu, "Romanian Peasantry and Bulgarian Agrarianism in the Interwar Period: Benchmarks for a Comparative Analysis", in ''The Romanian Review of Social Sciences'', Issue 16, 2014, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

====The PNA on minorities====
The party's stances evidenced Goga's conversion to antisemitism, which he had not explicitly embraced before 1932; within that framework, Goga was arguing that Jews were endorsing "[[Magyarization]]" in Transylvania.&lt;ref name="roots157"&gt;[[William I. Brustein]], ''Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe Before the Holocaust'', p. 157. Cambridge etc.: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2003.  {{isbn|0-521-77478-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, already in the 1910s Goga was modelling himself on [[Karl Lueger]], [[Cisleithania]]'s antisemitic doctrinaire.&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p. 85; Veiga, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, his ''Țara Noastră'' had expressed sympathy with the growing antisemitic trend among students, and indirectly with the [[Iron Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;Butaru, p. 161; Heinen, pp. 111, 161–162; Livezeanu, pp. 230–231&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Mustul care fierbe'', Goga further hinted that Jews were to blame for the ills of modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, pp. 160, 161–162&lt;/ref&gt; He voiced alarm about [[Greater Romania]] being invaded by "parasites" and "guess... who". However, he framed his support for the students in terms of social rejuvenation, and noted that violent antisemitism was perhaps an "incorrect slogan".&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, pp. 230–231&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Romanian general election, 1926|elections of 1926]], Goga, as [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Minister of the Interior]], had obtained favors for [[A. C. Cuza]]'s [[National-Christian Defense League]] (LANC), which was virulently antisemitic. However, his assistance proved a moderating influence, obliging Cuza to purge the LANC of radicals such as [[Ion Zelea Codreanu]], [[Valer Pop]], and [[Traian Brăileanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, pp. 112–113, 115–116, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Goga was still reassuring his readers that he was not an antisemite.&lt;ref&gt;Butaru, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; According to Minuț, his subsequent drift was a consequence of his taking money from antisemitic industrialists, and  in particular from [[Ion Gigurtu]].&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobic radicalization was additionally enhanced by the PNA–PNȚ conflict: Goga castigated his adversaries for their alleged [[Graft (politics)|grafting]] during the "[[Škoda Affair]]", which had profited the Polish industrialist [[Bruno Seletzky]]. However, Minuț notes, Goga was "contradictory" even at this late stage, sometimes stating his belief in the minorities' integration, but often decrying their participation in public life.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (2001), pp. 423–424, 426&lt;/ref&gt;

The PNA nevertheless had at least three Jewish affiliates: the Vianus, who probably believed that membership would compliment their [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]],&lt;ref name="boia"&gt;[[Lucian Boia]], ''Capcanele istoriei. Elita intelectuală românească între 1930 și 1950'', pp. 102–103. Bucharest: [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], 2012.  {{isbn|978-973-50-3533-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and journalist [[Henric Streitman]], who was primarily motivated by anticommunism.&lt;ref name="gbuzp1919"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[G. Brătescu]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20130927200143/http://js.mesagerul.ro/2009/12/11/uniunea-ziaristilor-profesionisti-1919-2009 "Uniunea Ziariștilor Profesioniști, 1919 – 2009. Compendiu aniversar"], in ''Mesagerul de Bistrița-Năsăud'', December 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; While Tudor Vianu co-chaired the PNA Studies Circle, alongside Petrovici,&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), pp. 273–274&lt;/ref&gt; Streitman was appointed on the PNA's Executive Committee.&lt;ref name="gbuzp1919"/&gt; 

The party remained open to other ethnic minorities: its branch in [[Durostor County]], organized by M. Magiari and [[Pericle Papahagi]], counted [[Turks of Romania|Turks]], [[Bulgarians in Romania|Bulgarians]] and [[Aromanians|Aromanians]] among its members.&lt;ref name="trrturt"/&gt; PNA sections in [[Bukovina]] were led by Petro Ivanciuc, Andriv Zemliuc and Necolai Palli, who were probably [[Ukrainians in Romania|Ukrainian]].&lt;ref&gt;Florin-Răzvan Mihai, "Dinamica electorală a candidaților minoritari din Bucovina la alegerile generale din România interbelică", in Vasile Ciobanu, Sorin Radu (eds.), ''Partide politice și minorități naționale din România în secolul XX'', Vol. V, pp. 96, 100. Sibiu: TechnoMedia.  {{isbn|978-973-739-261-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goga also had contacts within the [[Romani people in Romania|Romani community]], including activist [[Gheorghe A. Lăzăreanu-Lăzurică]], who acted as an electoral agent for both the PNA and the Iron Guard.&lt;ref&gt;Oprescu, pp. 32–33; Varga, p. 631&lt;/ref&gt; This issue highlighted the schism between the two Romani organizations, respectively led by Lăzăreanu and [[Calinic Șerboianu]]. At the time, Șerboianu accused his rival of being Goga's puppet.&lt;ref&gt;Varga, p. 631&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections===
According to Heinen, the PNA can be grouped into an "antisemitic [and] markedly right-wing" segment, alongside the LANC and the [[Citizen Bloc]]—but distinct from the more radical Iron Guard. The three parties had 9% of the vote in the [[Romanian general election, 1932|July 1932 election]], with the PNA itself at 3.64%&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; (or 4% and 108,857 ballots, in Minuț's count).&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; The leading candidates included Dragomir, Ghițescu, Gorun, Ioanid, Lupaș, Nemoianu, Scridon, Valjean, [[Sergiu Niță]], I. C. Atanasiu, Dumitru Topciu, as well as the party leader and his brother [[Eugen Goga]]. Eight were elected, including Octavian Goga for [[Mureș County|Mureș]], Ioanid for Mehedinți, Ghițescu for [[Teleorman County|Teleorman]], Pavel Cuciujna for [[Orhei County (Romania)|Orhei]], and Valjean for [[Romanați County|Romanați]];&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), pp. 274–275&lt;/ref&gt; Scridon also entered the Assembly by taking the second seat in [[Năsăud County]], with 2,069 votes.&lt;ref&gt;Moldovan, pp. 276–277, 306&lt;/ref&gt; According to Netea's first-hand account, Goga's victory was hard-won: peasants rounded up to mock him during his campaign tour at [[Deda, Mureș|Deda]].&lt;ref&gt;Netea, pp. 250–252&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking for his party, Ghițescu accused Premier Vaida of having falsified the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (1999), p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; The PNA chose not to compete in the by-elections of September, announcing that it was too caught up organizing its base. Vaida's paper, ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'', ridiculed this decision, noting that Goga had been "shamed" and was not risking further embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;"Sunt acri strugurii. Gogiștii nu candidează la alegerile parțiale", in ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'', Issue 70/1932, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In December, Carol asked Vaida to step down, and the National Liberals took over, with [[Ion G. Duca]] at the helm. Duca then approached the PNA leadership to establish a coalition, conditioned on Goga toning down his nationalism; Goga refused.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (2001), p. 426&lt;/ref&gt; The National Agrianists had cultivated a relationship with two other splinter groups of the classical parties: the [[National Liberal Party-Brătianu|Georgist Liberal Party]] and the [[Peasants' Party–Lupu|Lupist Peasantists]]. It developed into a working alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (2001), p. 430&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 1933, the PNA held a large rally on a high plain outside [[Târgoviște]]. Goga used this venue to announce his contempt for the PNȚ, describing its leader, [[Iuliu Maniu]], as "responsible for all misfortunes that have fallen upon this country."&lt;ref&gt;"Intrunirea gogistă dela Târgoviște", in ''[[Adevĕrul]]'', June 27, 1933, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The 1932 performance was closely mirrored in the [[Romanian general election, 1933|December 1933 election]], when the PNA managed 4.1%, with its family of parties again at 9%.&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p. 153; Minuț (2001), p. 428&lt;/ref&gt; The PNA had nine mandates: Goga, Scridon, Ioanid and Ghițescu held on to their seats; Valjean was also elected, but for [[Caraș County|Caraș]], with Petrovici taking his post in Romanați.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (2001), pp. 427–428&lt;/ref&gt; Topciu also won a seat, at [[Tighina County (Romania)|Tighina]], while physician [[Gheorghe Banu]] was elected at [[Ialomița County|Ialomița]]. Another new recruit, [[Vasile Goldiș]], failed to win the race for [[Arad County|Arad]], as did Ion Demetrescu-Agraru in [[Baia County|Baia]], while Lupaș lost at [[Sibiu County|Sibiu]] and Nemoianu at [[Severin County|Severin]].&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (2001), pp. 427–428&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the PNA had some 122,000 votes, which was enough to earn it an extra seat.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (2001), pp. 428, 430&lt;/ref&gt;

Between these two races, [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Germany had come under Nazi control]], and the PNA found itself intensely courted by the new regime, which pursued Eastern European alliances. Goga was a regular guest at the German Legation, and accepted offers for collaboration; however, he also insisted that [[Nazi Germany]] vouch for Greater Romania's borders.&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; During those months, the PNA, represented by Valjean, joined the "Antirevisionist League", a civic movement for the [[Little Entente]] and against [[Hungarian irredentism]].&lt;ref&gt;Livia Dandara, "Considerații privind fondarea Ligii antirevizioniste române", in ''Memoria Antiquitatis (Acta Musei Petrodavensis)'', Vols. XV–XVII, 1987, pp. 209–211&lt;/ref&gt; In its electoral program of 1933, the PNA proposed measures to supervise Romania's minorities, and in particular their "ideological imports".&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (2001), pp. 426–427&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, in March 1933, the Nazi agent of influence, Friedrich Weber, described Goga as a "man of the future", one who could bring Hitler's ideology to Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; A far-right politico, [[Nae Ionescu]], allegedly regarded Goga as a potential [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] of an Iron Guard cabinet. According to this version, Goga was tasked with enacting the "Hitlerian" program, including antisemitism and [[anti-Masonry]].&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; This pronouncement anticipated Goga's own departure from the [[Freemasonry in Romania|Romanian Freemasonry]], of which he was still a member in summer 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In September, Goga and [[Ștefan Tătărescu]] of the [[National Socialist Party (Romania)|Romanian National Socialists]] were both received by Hitler in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, pp. 228, 230&lt;/ref&gt; As historian Francisco Veiga notes, visits to Germany and the [[Kingdom of Italy]] made Goga "enthusiastic" and "completed [his] political evolution".&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merger and splinters===
The PNA and the LANC both repeatedly tried, but failed, to persuade the Iron Guard into a merger.&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; King Carol also proposed that the Guard be co-opted into a government coalition of "national forces", centered on the PP and the PNA.&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency was curbed by Premier Duca, who outlawed the Guard. Goga and the PNA reacted with public protests, viewing the measure as unwarranted.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (2001), p. 430&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, after Duca's assassination by Guardist ''[[Iron Guard death squads|Nicadori]]'', Goga sent boots to all those convicted for the murder.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; PNA deputies publicly called for an end to the anti-Guard wave of arrests, suggesting that it was unjustified.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (2001), p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, according to writer [[Al. Gherghel]], in August 1933 the PNA still viewed itself as standing against "right- and left-wing extremes", its platform one of "moderate progress".&lt;ref name="algh1"/&gt; In mid 1935, Goga also approached Vaida's new far-right party, called [[Romanian Front]] (FR), with offers of alliance or merger. Reportedly, Goga offered to fuse the PNA group into the FR, asking that he be assigned vice-chairmanship; Vaida refused, since he had promised that role to a long-time collaborator of his, [[Aurel Vlad]].&lt;ref&gt;Netea, pp. 253–254&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Agrarianists held their second and final congress on April 7, 1935, again at Rio Cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Minuț (2001), p. 430&lt;/ref&gt; On July 14,&lt;ref&gt;Butaru, p. 102; Minuț (1999), p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; the PNA merged with the LANC to form the [[National Christian Party]], a hard-line antisemitic group. It used as its most popular symbol the LANC swastika, which Goga himself acknowledged as standing for the "[[Aryan race]]".&lt;ref&gt;Radu, pp. 583–584&lt;/ref&gt; This new party had a shared presidency, with Cuza and Goga as co-chairs. It sought to challenge the Iron Guard whilst remaining close to more mainstream conservative forces.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; The merger was partly motivated by Cuza's political calculations, since the LANC had only taken 4.5% of the vote in 1933.&lt;ref name="roots157"/&gt; [[Nichifor Crainic]], who oversaw the LANC's paramilitary youth (or ''[[Lăncieri]]''), boasted an important role in negotiating the Goga–Cuza rapprochement.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Heinen suggests, Carol was also directly involved in pushing for the merger.&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, pp. 242, 249&lt;/ref&gt; Additional pressure had come from the office of [[Alfred Rosenberg]] in Nazi Germany, where a stronger antisemitic party in Romania was seen as desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 117; Levy, p. 158. See also Heinen, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; 

As noted by historian Lucian T. Butaru, Goga proved a worthy replacement for Cuza's first associate, [[Nicolae Paulescu]], who had died after disease in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Butaru, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the new party faced immediate difficulties. A far-left antifascist, [[Scarlat Callimachi]], noted in September 1935 that the PNC was made up from regional chapters that had no common ideological ground, the entire enterprise having been engineered by Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Ion Maximiuc, "Publiciști de vază în ziarul ''Clopotul'' din Botoșani", in ''Hierasus'', Vol. VI, 1986, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; The fusion resulted in another split: after being sidelined in favor of a Goga favorite, Ion V. Emilian quit the PNC and formed his own movement, called "Fire Swastika".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 118; Heinen, p. 250; Veiga, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Valjean also opposed the merger, and made a point of not attending the PNC's constitutive congress.&lt;ref&gt;"Ziarul ''Porunca Vremii'' scrie", in ''Înainte'', Issue 7/1935, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; His own National Agrarian Party, centered on Romanați, counted among its members poet [[Horia Furtună]], sculptor Dumitru Pavelescu-Dimo, and businessman Sterie Ionescu (formerly of the [[League Against Usury]]).&lt;ref name="botar"/&gt; Valjean's party still existed during the [[Romanian general election, 1937|general election of December 1937]], when it ran under a "T" logo, the old PNA symbol having been withdrawn and made unavailable for use.&lt;ref&gt;See list published alongside N. Papatansiu, "Războiul electoral", in ''[[Realitatea Ilustrată]]'', Issue 569, December 1937, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; 

Of the PNA moderates, Lupaș no longer joined the PNC, whereas his colleague Dragomir did.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Tudor Vianu left before the unification and the adoption of full-on antisemitism,&lt;ref name="boia"/&gt; with his brother resigning in 1935;&lt;ref name="emvianu"/&gt; by contrast, Streitman remained an outside ally, serving as the PNC's electoral agent.&lt;ref name="gbuzp1919"/&gt; Goga himself became more explicitly antisemitic. Appointed Carol's Prime Minister after the 1937 election, he introduced a [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|set of antisemitic laws]]. However, he continued to view himself as a moderate, censuring PNC radicals—including [[Gheorghe Cuza]], who took pride in fomenting violence.&lt;ref&gt;Butaru, pp. 271–272&lt;/ref&gt; Virulent antisemitism was also embraced by the Romani caucus of Craiova, whose leader, Lăzăreanu-Lăzurică, finally joined the PNC in February 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Oprescu, p. 33; Varga, pp. 633–634&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''neutral country''' is a [[sovereign state|state]] which is neutral towards [[belligerent]]s in a specific [[war]], or holds itself as permanently neutral in all future conflicts (including avoiding entering into [[military alliance]]s such as [[NATO]]). As a type of [[non-combatant]] status, neutral nationals enjoy protection under the [[law of war]] from belligerent actions to a greater extent than other non-combatants such as enemy [[civilian]]s and [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. The exact nature of neutrality can differ between the interpretations of various countries. Some, such as [[Costa Rica]], have demilitarized; whereas [[Switzerland]] holds to "armed neutrality" in which it deters aggression with a sizeable military, while barring itself from foreign deployment. Not all neutral countries avoid any foreign deployment or alliances, however, as [[Austria]], [[Ireland]], [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]] have active UN peacekeeping forces and a political alliance within the [[European Union]]. Sweden is not a truly "neutral" country: the traditional Swedish policy is not to participate in military alliances, with the intention of staying neutral in the case of war. Immediately before World War II, the Nordic countries stated their neutrality, but Sweden changed its position to that of non-belligerent at the start of the Winter War.

== Terminology ==
* A ''neutral country'' in a particular [[war]], is a [[sovereign state]] which officially declares itself to be neutral towards the belligerents. The rights and duties of a neutral power are defined in Sections 5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague05.asp|title=The Avalon Project - Laws of War : Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land (Hague V); October 18, 1907|website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 13&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague13.asp|title=The Avalon Project - Laws of War : Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War (Hague XIII); October 18, 1907|website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention of 1907]].
* A ''permanently neutral power'' is a sovereign state which is bound by [[international treaty]] to be neutral towards the belligerents of all future wars. An example of a permanently neutral power is Switzerland. The concept of neutrality in war is narrowly defined and puts specific constraints on the neutral party in return for the internationally recognised right to remain neutral.
* ''Neutralism'' or a "neutralist policy" is a [[foreign policy]] position wherein a state intends to remain neutral in future wars. A sovereign state that reserves the right to become a belligerent if attacked by a party to the war is in a condition of [[armed neutrality]].
* A [[non-belligerent]] state is one that indirectly participates in a war, politically and / or materially helping one side of the conflict and thus not participating militarily.  For example it may allow its territory to be used for the war effort.

== Rights and responsibilities of a neutral power ==
[[Belligerent]]s may not invade neutral territory,&lt;ref&gt;Hague Convention, §5 Art.1&lt;/ref&gt; and a neutral power's resisting any such attempt does not compromise its neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;Hague Convention, §5 Art.10&lt;/ref&gt;

A neutral power must [[internment|intern]] belligerent troops who reach its territory,&lt;ref&gt;Hague Convention, §5 Art.11&lt;/ref&gt; but not escaped [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].&lt;ref&gt;Hague Convention, §5 Art.13&lt;/ref&gt; Belligerent armies may not recruit neutral citizens,&lt;ref&gt;Hague Convention, §5 Art.4,5&lt;/ref&gt; but they may go abroad to enlist.&lt;ref&gt;Hague Convention, §5 Art.6&lt;/ref&gt; Belligerent armies' personnel and material may not be transported across neutral territory,&lt;ref&gt;Hague Convention, §5 Art.2&lt;/ref&gt; but the wounded may be.&lt;ref&gt;Hague Convention, §5 Art.14&lt;/ref&gt; A neutral power may supply communication facilities to belligerents,&lt;ref&gt;Hague Convention, §5 Art.8&lt;/ref&gt; but not war material,&lt;ref&gt;Hague Convention, §13 Art.6&lt;/ref&gt; although it need not prevent export of such material.&lt;ref&gt;Hague Convention, §13 Art.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Belligerent [[naval]] vessels may use neutral ports for a maximum of 24 hours, though neutrals may impose different restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;Hague Convention, §13 Art.12&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions are to make repairs—only the minimum necessary to put back to sea&lt;ref&gt;Hague Convention, §13 Art.14&lt;/ref&gt;—or if an opposing belligerent's vessel is already in port, in which case it must have a 24-hour head start.&lt;ref&gt;Hague Convention, §13 Art.16&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Prize (law)|prize]] ship captured by a belligerent in the [[territorial waters]] of a neutral power must be surrendered by the belligerent to the neutral, which must intern its crew.&lt;ref&gt;Hague Convention, §13 Art.3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition and codification==
Neutrality has been recognised in different ways, and sometimes involves a formal guarantor. For example, Austria has its neutrality guaranteed by its four former occupying powers, Switzerland by the signatories of the [[Congress of Vienna]] and Finland by the Soviet Union during the [[Cold War]]. The form of recognition varies, often by bilateral treaty (Finland), multilateral treaty (Austria) or a UN declaration (Turkmenistan). These treaties can in some ways be forced on a country (Austria's neutrality was insisted upon by the Soviet Union) but in other cases it is an active policy of the country concerned to respond to a geopolitical situation ([[Irish neutrality during World War II|Ireland in the Second World War]]).&lt;ref name="nato notes"/&gt;

For the country concerned, the policy is usually codified beyond the treaty itself. Austria and Japan codify their neutrality in their constitutions, but they do so with different levels of detail. Some details of neutrality are left to be interpreted by the government while others are explicitly stated, for example Austria may not host any foreign bases and Japan cannot participate in foreign wars. Yet Sweden, lacking formal codification, was more flexible during the Second World War in allowing troops to pass through its territory.&lt;ref name="nato notes"/&gt;

==Armed neutrality==
[[File:Schweizer Armee Füs Gr.jpg|thumb|Switzerland is a key example of a country outside of any military alliance, but maintaining a strong deterrent force]]
Armed neutrality is the posture of a state or group of states that has no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from any party.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim, ''International Law: War and Neutrality,'' 1906, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; This may include:

*Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any [[belligerent]] power.&lt;ref name="Armed Neutrality Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Armed Neutrality|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/armed%20neutrality|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a [[neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] power, during said war, to hold itself ready to resist by force, any aggression of either belligerent. &lt;ref name="USLegal Armed Neutrality Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Armed Neutrality Law &amp; Legal Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/a/armed-neutrality/#|publisher=USLegal|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Neutrality maintained while weapons are kept available.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionaries Definition of Armed Neutrality"&gt;{{cite web|title=Armed Neutrality|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/armed-neutrality|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Armed neutrality makes a seemingly-neutral state take up arms for protection to maintain its neutrality.

Sweden and Switzerland are, independent of each other, famed for their armed neutrality, which they maintained throughout both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Bissell and Gasteyger, ''The Missing link: West European Neutrals and Regional Security,'' 1990, p. 117; Murdoch and Sandler, "Swedish Military Expenditures and Armed Neutrality," in ''The Economics of Defence Spending,'' 1990, p. 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss have a long history of neutrality: it has not been in a state of war internationally since 1815 and did not join the [[United Nations]] until 2002. It pursues, however, an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world.&lt;ref name="American Foreign Relations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Switzerland - Knowledge Encyclopedia|url=http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/knowledge/Switzerland.html#ixzz2zljr1fa9|publisher=Knowledge Encyclopedia|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Edwin Reischauer]], "To be neutral you must be ready to be highly militarized, like Switzerland or Sweden."&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, Emerson. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DC163AF931A3575AC0A966958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=edwin+o+reischauer&amp;st=nyt "Edwin Reischauer, Diplomat and Scholar, Dies at 79,"] ''New York Times''. September 2, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, other neutral states may [[List of countries without armed forces|abandon military power]] (examples of states doing this include [[Costa Rica]] and [[Liechtenstein]]) or reduce it, but rather uses it for the express purpose of home defence and the maintenance of its neutrality. But not having a military does not result in neutrality as many countries, such as [[Iceland]], replaced a standing military with a military guarantee from a stronger power.

===Leagues of Armed Neutrality===
The phrase "armed neutrality" sometimes refers specifically to one of the "Leagues of Armed Neutrality".

*The [[First League of Armed Neutrality]] was an alliance of minor [[naval]] powers organized in 1780 by [[Catherine II of Russia]] to protect neutral shipping in the [[War of American Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, Scott, ''The Armed Neutralities of 1780 and 1800: A Collection of Official Documents Preceded by the Views of Representative Publicists,'' 1918; Karsh, ''Neutrality and Small States,'' 1988, p. 16-17; Jones, ''Crucible of Power: A History of American Foreign Relations to 1913,'' 2009, p. 15-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the First League of Armed Neutrality was viewed by Americans as a mark of Russian friendship and sympathy. This league had a lasting impact of Russian-American relations, and the relations of those two powers and Britain. It was also the basis for [[Admiralty law|international maritime law]], which is still in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vinarov|first=Mikhail|title=The First League of Armed Neutrality|url=http://www.citelighter.com/history/history/knowledgecards/the-first-league-of-armed-neutrality|publisher=CiteLighter|accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of political science, this is the first historical example of armed neutrality, however, scholars like Dr. Carl Kulsrud argue that the concept of armed neutrality was introduced even earlier. Within 90 years before the First League of Armed Neutrality was established, neutral powers had joined forces no less than three times. As early as 1613, [[Free City of Lübeck|Lubeck]] and [[County of Holland|Holland]] joined powers to continue their maritime exploration without the commitment of being involved in wartime struggles on the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kulsrud|first=Carl|title=Armed Neutralitys to 1780|publisher=American Journal of International Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**The [[Second League of Armed Neutrality]] was an effort to revive this during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, Scott, ''The Armed Neutralities of 1780 and 1800: A Collection of Official Documents Preceded by the Views of Representative Publicists,'' 1918; Karsh, ''Neutrality and Small States,'' 1988, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; It was an alliance with [[Denmark–Norway|Denmark-Norway]], [[Prussia]], Sweden and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. It occurred during 1800 and 1801. The idea of this second league was to protect neutral shipping from the British [[Royal Navy]]. However, Britain took this as the alliance taking up sides with France, thus attacking Denmark. The alliance was forced to withdraw from the league.
*A potential Third League of Armed Neutrality was discussed during the [[American Civil War]], but was never realised.&lt;ref&gt;Bienstock, ''The Struggle for the Pacific,'' 2007, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peacekeeping==
[[File:Best 15 (11419866795).jpg|thumb|Irish units on UN patrol in the [[Golan Heights]], [[Syria]].]]
For many states, such as Ireland and Sweden, neutrality does not mean the absence of any foreign interventionism. [[Peacekeeping]] missions for the United Nations are seen as intertwined with it.&lt;ref name="Irish peacekeeping"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/protecting-neutrality-in-a-militarised-eu-1.915577|title=Protecting neutrality in a militarised EU|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss electorate rejected a 1994 proposal to join UN peacekeeping operations. Despite this, 23 Swiss observers and police have been deployed around the world in UN projects.&lt;ref&gt;

==Points of debate==
The legitimacy of whether some states are as neutral as they claim has been questioned in some circles, although this depends largely on a state's interpretation of its form of neutrality.

===European Union===
There are five members of the [[European Union]] that still describe themselves as a neutral country in some form: [[Austria]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Finland]], [[Malta]] and [[Sweden]]. With the development of the EU's [[Common Security and Defence Policy]], the extent to which they are, or should be, neutral is debated. For example former [[Finnish Prime Minister]], [[Matti Vanhanen]], on 5 July 2006, stated that Finland was no longer neutral:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''[[Tobias Pflüger|Mr Pflüger]] described Finland as neutral. I must correct him on that: Finland is a member of the EU. We were at one time a politically neutral country, during the time of the Iron Curtain. Now we are a member of the Union, part of this community of values, which has a common policy and, moreover, a common foreign policy.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+CRE+20060705+ITEM-002+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN Presentation of the programme of the Finnish presidency (debate)] 5 July 2006, [[European Parliament]] Strasbourg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Finnish Prime Minister [[Juha Sipila]] on 5 December 2017 still described the country as "militarily non-aligned" and that it should remain so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-finland-independence/finland-should-stay-militarily-non-aligned-prime-minister-idUSKBN1DY2K3|title=Finland should stay militarily non-aligned: prime minister|date=4 December 2017|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland, which sought guarantees for its neutrality in EU treaties, argues that its neutrality does not mean that Ireland should avoid engagement in international affairs such as peacekeeping operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dfa.ie/our-role-policies/international-priorities/peace-and-security/neutrality/|title=Neutrality - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|first=Department of Foreign|last=Affairs|website=www.dfa.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the enactment of the [[Lisbon Treaty]], EU members are bound by [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title V: General Provisions on the Union's External Action Service and Specific Provisions on the Common Foreign and Security Policy#SECTION 2: PROVISIONS ON THE COMMON SECURITY AND DEFENCE POLICY|TEU, Article 42.7]], which obliges states to assist a fellow member that is the victim of armed aggression. It accords 
"an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in [other member states'] power" but would "not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States" (neutral policies), allowing members to respond with non-military aid.

With the launch of [[Permanent Structured Cooperation]] (PESCO) in defence at the end of 2017, the EU's activity on military matters has increased. The policy was designed to be inclusive and allows for states to opt in or out of specific forms of military cooperation. That has allowed most of the neutral states to participate, but opinions still vary. Some members of the Irish Parliament considered Ireland's joining PESCO as an abandonment of neutrality. It was passed with the government arguing that its opt-in nature allowed Ireland to "join elements of PESCO that were beneficial such as counter-terrorism, cyber security and peace keeping... what we are not going to be doing is buying aircraft carriers and fighter jets". Malta, as of December 2017, is the only neutral state not to participate in PESCO. The Maltese government argued that it was going to wait and see how PESCO develops to see whether it would compromise Maltese neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/europe/83085/malta_to_wait_and_see_before_deciding_on_pesco_defence_pact_muscat_says#.Wje3pN9l-Co|title=Malta to ‘wait and see’ before deciding on PESCO defence pact, Muscat says|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moldova===
The neutrality of [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]] is an interesting case. According to Ion Marandici, Moldova has chosen neutrality in order to avoid Russian security schemes and Russian military presence on its territory.&lt;ref name=Marandici&gt;{{cite web|last=Marandici |first=Ion |title=Moldova's neutrality: what is at stake? |publisher=IDIS-Viitorul and the Center for European Studies |location=Lviv |year=2006 |url=http://www.viitorul.org/public/866/en/IonM%20-%20studiu_neutralitate__eng_.doc |format=[[MS Word]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030085827/http://www.viitorul.org/public/866/en/IonM%20-%20studiu_neutralitate__eng_.doc |archivedate=2008-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if the country is constitutionally neutral, some researchers argue that de facto this former Soviet republic never was neutral, because [[14th Army involvement in Transnistria|parts of the Russian 14th army are present]] at [[Bendery]].&lt;ref name=Marandici/&gt; The same author suggests that one solution in order to avoid unnecessary contradictions and deepen at the same time the relations with [[NATO]] would be "to interpret the concept of permanent neutrality in a flexible manner".&lt;ref name=Marandici/&gt;

Many countries made neutrality declarations during [[World War II]]. Most, however, became occupied, and in the end only the states of [[Andorra]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]], [[Francoist Spain|Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] (with [[Liechtenstein]]), and [[Vatican City|Vatican]] (the [[Holy See]]) remained neutral of the European countries closest to the war.  Their fulfillment to the letter of the rules of neutrality have been questioned: Ireland supplied important secret information to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]; for instance, the date of [[D-Day]] was decided on the basis of incoming Atlantic [[meteorology|weather information]] secretly supplied to them by Ireland but kept from Germany. Axis or Allied pilots who crash landed in Ireland were interned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13924720|title=The WWII camp where Allies and Germans mixed|date=28 June 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden and Switzerland, as embedded within [[Nazi Germany]] and its occupied territory, similarly made some concessions to Nazi requests as well as to Allied requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2db.com/country/sweden|title=Sweden in World War II|first=C. Peter|last=Chen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden was also involved in intelligence operations with the Allies, including listening stations in Sweden and espionage in Germany, as well as secret military training of Norwegian and Danish soldiers in Sweden.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Spain also pursued a policy of "non-alignment" and sent a [[Blue Division|volunteer combat division]] to aid the Nazi war effort.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Portugal officially stayed neutral, but actively supported both the Allies by providing overseas naval bases and Germany by keeping its war machine alight with the extensive sale of [[tungsten]].

The United States was initially neutral during the war and was initially bound [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]] of 1936 not to sell war materiels to belligerents. Once war broke out, [[US President]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] succeeded in getting Congress to replace the act with the [[Cash and carry (World War II)|Cash and carry program]] that allowed the US to provide military aid to the allies, despite opposition from isolationist members.&lt;ref name="Neutrality Acts"&gt;{{cite book| last=Brinkley | first= Dougals| last2= Rubel | first2=David | title= World War II: The Axis Assault, 1939-1940 | year= 2003 | publisher= MacMillan | location= USA | pages= 99–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of '''official [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]''' can be taken by larger political parties who do not participate in Northern Ireland's [[consociational]] power-sharing [[Northern Ireland Executive|Executive]]. Forming an '''Assembly Opposition''' empowers opposition parties to scrutinise the work of government,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://education.niassembly.gov.uk/post_16/the_work_of_the_assembly/scrutinise/committees/official-opposition|title=Official Opposition {{!}} Northern Ireland Assembly Education Service|website=education.niassembly.gov.uk|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving them financial assistance, enhanced speaking rights in the chamber and the right to chair certain [[Northern Ireland Assembly#Organisation|committees]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While the Assembly and Executive had been in operation since 1998 and 1999, respectively (following the [[Good Friday Agreement]]), the Assembly Opposition was only established in 2016, as part of the [[Stormont House Agreement|Fresh Start Agreement]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The opportunity was first taken by the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] and [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] for the Assembly's [[Members of the 5th Northern Ireland Assembly|fifth term]], following the [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2016|May 2016 assembly election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/northern-irelands-first-official-opposition-%E2%80%93-step-towards-%E2%80%98normal-politics%E2%80%99|title=Northern Ireland's first official Opposition – a step towards ‘normal politics’? {{!}} The Institute for Government|website=www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposition in previous legislatures ==
Northern Ireland was governed from 1921 to 1972 by a bicameral [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]], where in the lower [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland|House of Commons]] the largest and therefore the governing party was consistently the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. It could have been expected, following the Westminster system, that the role of official Opposition would be taken by largest party outside of government,{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} which was consistently an [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] party (jointly [[Sinn Féin]] and the [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist Party]] in the Parliament's [[Members of the 1st Northern Ireland Parliament|first term]] from 1921 to 1925, and thereafter the Nationalist Party). However, during this time members of the nationalist opposition often practised a policy of [[abstentionism]] where they would run for seats in the parliament but refuse to take them if elected, in order not to give legitimacy to British rule or the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]]. Nationalist Party members refused to take their seats in the legislature until 1924, and resumed the abstentionist policy in the 1930s to protest the abolition of [[proportional representation]]. From 1937, [[Thomas Joseph Campbell]] and [[Richard Byrne (politician)|Richard Byrne]] were the only Nationalist MPs to take their seats until Byrne's death in 1942 and Campbell's resignation in 1945.

It was not until February 1965 that the Nationalist Party agreed to accept recognition as the Official Opposition in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=6hFEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26|title=Northern Ireland: Conflict and Change|last=Tonge|first=Jonathan|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317875185|location=London/New York|pages=26–27|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/pageview.html?volumeno=59&amp;pageno=128|title=The Stormont Papers: 'The Parliamentary Debates (Official Report).

[[Roderick O'Connor (politician)|Roderick O'Connor]] succeeded McAteer as Nationalist Party leader but the party again withdrew from its role as Official Opposition for the [[Members of the 12th Northern Ireland Parliament|twelfth and final term]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The majority-rule Parliament was abolished and replaced in 1973 by a unicameral [[Northern Ireland Assembly (1973)|Northern Ireland Assembly]]. An [[Executive of the 1974 Northern Ireland Assembly|Executive]] was formed in which unionist, nationalist and cross-community parties shared power for the first time. However, that government only lasted from January to May 1974, and from then until the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 Northern Ireland was [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|ruled directly]] by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]].

== Participation ==
The legal basis for the Assembly Opposition was established by the Assembly and Executive Reform (Assembly Opposition) Act (Northern Ireland) 2016.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2016/10/contents|title=Assembly and Executive Reform (Assembly Opposition) Act (Northern Ireland) 2016|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under section 2,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2016/10/section/2|title=Section 2, Assembly and Executive Reform (Assembly Opposition) Act (Northern Ireland) 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; a party may join the official Opposition if it meets one or both of two criteria:
* It is entitled to one or more ministerial roles following the [[D'Hondt method]] (as described in the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]], section 18(2)–(6)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/47/section/18|title=Northern Ireland Act 1998|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;) but declines them;
* It holds 8% or more of the total number of seats in the Assembly. This amounted to nine out of 108 seats in the Assembly's [[Members of the 5th Northern Ireland Assembly|fifth term]] (2016–2017), but eight out of 90 from the [[Members of the 6th Northern Ireland Assembly|sixth term]] (2017–) when five rather than six MLAs were returned from each constituency. It would equate to 7 out of 85 seats in future under a proposed reduction in the number of constituencies from 18 to 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boundarycommission.org.uk/2018-review|title=2018 Review|date=2016-02-16|work=Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The UUP and SDLP consistently fulfil both criteria, while [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance]] fulfilled the second in the 2017 election having returned eight members. Meanwhile, the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and Sinn Féin would currently be excluded from entering opposition if they wished to, because as the largest unionist and largest nationalist party they must participate in the Executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/47/section/16A|title=Section 16A, Northern Ireland Act 1998|last=|first=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assembly Opposition Act recognises the offices of Leader of the Largest Non-Executive Party and Leader of the Second-Largest Non-Executive Party, although these positions may be given alternative names (section 5).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2016/10/section/5|title=Section 5, Assembly and Executive Reform (Assembly Opposition) Act (Northern Ireland) 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits of official status ==
Following the Assembly Opposition Act, the standing orders which regulate how the Assembly conducts its business were amended on 14 March 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/assembly-business/standing-orders/recent-amendments/|title=Recent Amendments to Standing Orders|website=www.niassembly.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide the Assembly Opposition with:
* official recognition (Standing Order 45A);
* the right to ask the first Topical Question (Standing Order 20A,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/assembly-business/standing-orders/standing-orders/#a20a|title=Standing Order 20A, Standing Orders as amended 4 October 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=www.niassembly.gov.uk|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; following section 6 of the Act);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2016/10/section/6|title=Section 6, Assembly and Executive Reform (Assembly Opposition) Act (Northern Ireland) 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a period for Opposition Business (Standing Order 10).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/assembly-business/standing-orders/standing-orders/#a10|title=Standing Order 10, Standing Orders as amended 4 October 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=www.niassembly.gov.uk|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Assembly Opposition Act also required standing orders to grant:
* enhanced speaking rights "including a minimum of 10 days per year set aside for Opposition business" (section 8);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2016/10/section/8|title=Section 8, Assembly and Executive Reform (Assembly Opposition) Act (Northern Ireland) 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the right to chair the Public Accounts Committee (section 9);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2016/10/section/9|title=Section 9, Assembly and Executive Reform (Assembly Opposition) Act (Northern Ireland) 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* membership of the Business Committee (section 10);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2016/10/section/10|title=Section 10, Assembly and Executive Reform (Assembly Opposition) Act (Northern Ireland) 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and amended the Financial Assistance for Political Parties Act (Northern Ireland) 2000 to give Assembly Opposition parties additional funding (section 11).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2016/10/section/11|title=Section 11, Assembly and Executive Reform (Assembly Opposition) Act (Northern Ireland) 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3852">[[Image:Tungro study Indonesia 2002.jpg|frame|right|Indonesian farmers carrying out their own research into control of ''tungro'' disease on rice (Photo by FAO Community IPM Programme)]]'''Participatory technology development (PTD)''' is an approach to learning and innovation that is used in [[international development]] as part of projects and programmes relating to [[sustainable agriculture]]. The approach involves collaboration between researchers and farmers in the analysis of agricultural problems and testing of alternative farming practices.

== Origins ==

The origins of Participatory Technology Development can be found in a number of approaches, concepts and techniques that became popular in the 1970s and 1980s: 

* [[Farming systems research and extension]], an approach that introduced social-economic issues into organisations previously dominated by biological and chemical scientists. FSR/E also promoted the idea on 'on-farm' trials;
* [[Appropriate technology]], a concept that recognises the importance of matching the design of technology to the resources and culture of the user.
* [[Indigenous technical knowledge]], a concept that recognised the importance of local expertise and traditional wisdom;
* [[Participatory rural appraisal]], a set of techniques that promoted the involvement of rural people in decision-making.

== Process ==

One of the leading authorities on this process is the [http://www.ileia.org ''Centre for learning on sustainable agriculture - ILEIA''] based in the Netherlands. ILEIA has described PTD as “a process between local communities and outside facilitators which involves: 

* gaining a joint understanding of the main characteristics and changes of that particular agro-ecological system;
* defining priority problems;
* experimenting locally with a variety of options derived both from indigenous knowledge … and from formal science, and
* enhancing farmer’s experimental capacities and farmer-to-farmer communication”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agriculturesnetwork.org/resources/pubs/1992-farming-for-future |title='''Farming for the Future: An Introduction to Low-External-Input and Sustainable Agriculture''' |author= Coen Reijntjes, Bertus Haverkort and Ann Waters-Bayer|publisher=ILEIA, Leusden |date=1992 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Facilitators ==

PTD facilitators are usually researchers, sometimes consisting of a team that includes both biological and social scientists. While PTD is closely linked to research, it often crosses the boundary into [[agricultural extension]] because it involves learning activities with farmers.

[[File:PcGdns2062.jpg|thumb|The Peace Gardens looking East towards St Paul's development]]

The '''Peace Gardens''' are an [[inner city]] square in [[Sheffield]], [[England]].  It was created as part of the [[Heart of the City (development)|Heart of the City]] project by [[Sheffield City Council]].{{fact|date=August 2016}}

The Gardens themselves front onto Sheffield's [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] [[Sheffield Town Hall|town hall]]—not to be confused with the [[Sheffield City Hall]], a concert venue.

==History==
The Gardens were first laid out in 1938, following the demolition of [[St Paul's Church, Sheffield|St Paul's Church]].  Originally named '''St Paul's Gardens''', they were immediately nicknamed the "Peace Gardens", marking the contemporary signing of the [[Munich Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Harman and John Minnis, ''Pevsner Architectural Guides: Sheffield''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Gardens were originally intended to be replaced by an extension to the Town Hall, but due to [[World War II]], this was never built.&lt;ref name="council"&gt;[https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/out--about/parks-woodlands--countryside/gardens/the-peace-gardens.html The Peace Gardens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920044302/https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/out--about/parks-woodlands--countryside/gardens/the-peace-gardens.html |date=2015-09-20 }}, [[Sheffield City Council]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985, the space was formally renamed the "Peace Gardens".&lt;ref&gt;Chen Chao, ''[http://jusnews.group.shef.ac.uk/peacegardens.php Sights in Sheffield: The Peace Gardens]''{{dead link|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sheffield gardens are a fine example of the network of similar gardens created between the two world wars and presage later gardens and community spaces in London and other urban centres.&lt;ref&gt; Gough, P.J. (2007) ''Planting peace: the Greater London Council and the community gardens of central London'', International Journal of Heritage Studies, Vol. 13, No. 1, pp. 22–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 work commenced to remove the former St Pauls graveyard, and the whole space was re-modeled.  Water features and a central fountain were introduced, with the channels representing the rivers of Sheffield.  The construction work was carried out by Tilbury Douglas Construction (now Interserve) under a Management form of Contract, with the design work carried out mainly by Sheffield City Council. The "topping out ceremony" was carried out by Prince Charles, and a plaque on Pinstone Street was unveiled to mark this event. The Peace Gardens were substantially completed by the end of 1998, then the Sheffield Millennium Galleries works commenced and the old egg-box council offices were then demolished. This allowed the remained of the Peace Gardens to be completed in a second phase.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

==Features==
[[File:HolberryCascade.jpg|thumb|upright|One of the cascades]]
Public Consultation showed strong support for a garden rather than the multi purpose open square which had been earlier advised by architectural consultants.{{fact|date=August 2016}} It has [[Fountain|fountains]] at the centre, and cascades around the outside.  These are to represent the flowing molten [[steel]], which made Sheffield famous, and also the water of Sheffield's [[rivers]], the [[River Sheaf|Sheaf]], [[River Don, South Yorkshire|River Don]], [[River Rivelin]], [[River Loxley]] and [[Porter Brook]], which were used to power the mills which drove [[Sheffield]]'s industry.

The site contains several memorials for Sheffielders who served in wars, including in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and another plaque commemorating Sheffielders who gave their lives in all conflicts, including the [[Korean War]]. It also contains a memorial to [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]], unveiled on Hiroshima Day, 8 August 1985, in the presence of three survivors of the atomic devastation.&lt;ref&gt;13. "The New Peace Gardens" in More Sheffield Curiosities by Duncan &amp; Trevor Smith.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other memorials include the Holberry Cascades, named for local [[Chartism|Chartist]] leader [[Samuel Holberry]], the [[Bochum]] Bell, donated by Sheffield's German twin city [[Bochum]], and a set of standard measures.&lt;ref name="council" /&gt;

A '''public hospital''' or '''government hospital''' is a [[hospital]] which is owned by a [[government]] and receives government funding. In some countries, this type of hospital provides medical care free of charge, the cost of which is covered by government reimbursement.

==Australia==
In Australia, public hospitals are operated and funded by each individual state's health department. The federal government also contributes funding. Services in public hospitals for all Australian citizens and permanent residents are fully subsidized by the federal government's [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] [[Universal Healthcare]] program. Hospitals in Australia treat all Australian citizens and permanent residents regardless of their age, income, or social status.

[[Emergency Department]]s are almost exclusively found in public hospitals. Private hospitals rarely operate emergency departments, and patients treated at these private facilities are billed for care. Some costs, however (''pathology, X-ray'') may qualify for billing under Medicare.

Where patients hold private [[health insurance]], after initial treatment by a public hospital's emergency department, the patient has the option of being transferred to a private hospital.

==Brazil==
The Brazilian health system is a mix composed by public hospitals, non-profit philanthropic hospitals, and private hospitals. The majority of the low and medium-income population uses services provided by public hospitals run by either by the State or the municipality. Since the inception of 1988 Federal Constitution, health care is a universal right for everyone living in Brazil: citizens, permanent residents, and foreigners. To provide this service, the Brazilian government created a national public health insurance system called SUS (Sistema Unico de Saúde, Unified Health System) in which all publicly funded hospitals (public and philanthropic entities) receive payments based on the number of patients and procedures performed. The construction and operation of hospitals and health clinics are also a responsibility of the government.

The system provides universal coverage to all patients, including emergency care, preventive medicine, diagnostic procedures, surgeries (except cosmetic procedures) and medicine necessary to treat their condition. However, given budget constraints, these services are often unavailable in the majority of the country with the exception of major metropolitan regions, and even in those cities access to complex procedures may be delayed because of long lines. Despite this scenario, some patients were able to successfully sue the government for full SUS coverage for procedures performed in non-public facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trf-4.jusbrasil.com.br/jurisprudencia/17506771/apelacao-civel-ac-8092-rs-20027108008092-4-trf4|title=ADMINISTRATIVO. RESSARCIMENTO DE DESPESAS MÉDICAS PARTICULARES. IMPOSSIBILIDADE DE ATENDIMENTO PELO SUS. LEGITIMIDADE PASSIVA. NÃO COMPROVAÇÃO DA CARÊNCIA DE RECURSOS FINANCEIROS DO PACIENTE.

Recently, new legislation has been enacted forbidding private hospitals to refuse treatment to patients with insufficient funds in case of life-threatening emergencies. The law also determines that the healthcare costs in this situation are to be paid by the SUS.

==Canada==
In Canada all hospitals are funded through [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]], [[Canada]]'s [[Public sector|publicly funded]] [[universal health care|universal health insurance system]] and operated by the provincial governments.&lt;ref name=Medicare&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitals in Canada treat all Canadian citizens and permanent residents regardless of their age, income, or social status.

==India==
In India, public hospitals (called Government Hospitals) provide health care free at the point of use for any Indian citizen. These are usually individual state funded. However, hospitals funded by the central (federal) government also exist. State hospitals are run by the state (local) government and may be dispensaries, peripheral health centers, rural hospital, district hospitals or medical college hospitals (hospitals with affiliated medical college). In 
many states (like Tamil Nadu) the hospital bill is entirely funded by the state government with patient not having to pay anything for treatment. However, other hospitals will charge nominal amounts for admission to special rooms and for medical and surgical consumables.  The reliability and approachability of doctors and staff in private hospitals have resulted in preference of people from the public to private health centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/friendly-service-modern-facilities-draw-people-to-private-healthcare-centres/article18734394.ece|title=Friendly service, modern facilities draw people to private healthcare centres|newspaper=The Hindu|date=7 June 2017|accessdate=13 September 2018|last1=Reporter|first1=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; However state owned hospitals in India are known for high patient load and there is persistent claims of incident relating to physical abuse on doctors and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/2-mamc-doctors-assaulted-fir-registered/article22872367.ece|title=2 MAMC doctors assaulted, FIR registered|newspaper=The Hindu|date=28 February 2018|accessdate=13 September 2018|last1=Reporter|first1=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norway==
In Norway, all public hospitals are funded from the national budget&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and run by four Regional Health Authorities (RHA) owned by the Ministry of Health and Care Services. In addition to the public hospitals, a few privately owned health clinics are operating. The four Regional Health Authorities are: [[Northern Norway Regional Health Authority]], [[Central Norway Regional Health Authority]], [[Western Norway Regional Health Authority]], and [[South-eastern Norway Regional Health Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==South Africa==
South Africa has private and public hospitals. Public hospitals are funded by the Department of Health. The majority of the patients use public hospitals in which patients pay a nominal fee, roughly $3–5. The patients point of entry usually is through primary health care (Clinics) usually run by nurses. The next level of care would be district hospitals which have General Practitioners and basic radiographs. The next level of care would be Regional hospitals which have general practitioners, specialists and ICU's, and CT SCANS. The highest level of care is Tertiary which includes super specialists, MRI scans, and nuclear medicine scans.

Private patients either have healthcare insurance, known as medical aid, or have to pay the full amount privately if uninsured.

==United Kingdom==
In the UK public hospitals provide health care free at the point of use for the patient. Private health care is used by less than 8&amp;nbsp;percent of the population. The UK system is known as the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) and has been funded from general taxation since 1948.

==United States==
[[File:BenTaubHospitalHoustonTX.JPG|thumb|[[Ben Taub General Hospital]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]]]
In the United States, two thirds of all urban hospitals are non-profit. The remaining third is split between for-profit and public, public hospitals not necessarily being [[Non-profit hospital|not-for-profit hospital corporations]].

=== History ===
The safety-net role of public hospitals has evolved since 1700s when the first U.S. public hospital sheltered and provided medical healthcare to the poor.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/17619|title=The Health Care Safety Net in a Post-Reform World|last=Hall|first=Mark A.|last2=Rosenbaum|publisher=Sara|year=2012|isbn=|location=Rutgers University Press|pages=|chapter=Chapter 8: The Safety-Net Role of Public Hospitals and Academic Medical Centers: Past, Present, and Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the late 20th century, public hospitals represented the "poor house" that undertook social welfare roles. The "poor house" also provided secondarily medical care, specifically during epidemics. For this reason, these "poor houses" were later known as "pest" houses. Following this phase was the "practitioner period" during which, the then welfare oriented urban public hospitals changed their focus to medical care and formalized nursing care. This new phase was highlighted by the private physicians providing care to patients outside their private practices into inpatient hospital settings. To put into practice the demands of the [[Flexner Report]] published in 1910, public hospitals later benefitted from the best medical care technology to hire full-time staff members,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; instruct medical and nursing students during the "academic period".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The privatization of public hospitals was often contemplated during this period and stalled once an infectious disease outbreak such as [[influenza]] in 1918, [[tuberculosis]] in the early 1900s, and the [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] epidemic in the 1950s hit the U.S.. At this time, with the goal to improve people's health and welfare by allowing for effective health planning and the creation of neighborhood health centers, health policies like the [[Social Security Act]] were enacted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was followed by [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and Medicaid Act in 1965 that gave poor people in the U.S., access to inpatient and outpatient medical care&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; from public hospitals after racial segregation ended in the South. With their mandate to care for low income patients, the public hospital started engaging in leadership roles in the communities they care for since the 1980s.

=== Repercussions of accumulated uncompensated care ===
In the U.S., public hospitals receive significant funding from local, state, and/or federal governments.  Currently, many urban public hospitals in the U.S. playing the role of [[Safety net hospital|safety-net hospitals]], which do not turn away the underinsured and uninsured such as the vulnerable ethnic minorities,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Becker|first=Gay|date=2004-06-01|title=Deadly Inequality in the Health Care "Safety Net": Uninsured Ethnic Minorities' Struggle to Live with Life-Threatening Illnesses|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=258–275|doi=10.1525/maq.2004.18.2.258|issn=1548-1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; may charge [[Medicaid]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and private insurers for the care of patients. Public hospitals, especially in urban areas, have a high concentration of uncompensated care and graduate medical education as compared to all other American hospitals. 23% of emergency care, 63% of burn care and 40% of trauma care are handled by public hospitals in the urban cities of the United States.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ko|first=Michelle|last2=Needleman|first2=Jack|last3=Derose|first3=Kathryn Pitkin|last4=Laugesen|first4=Miriam J.|last5=Ponce|first5=Ninez A.|date=2013-12-19|title=Residential Segregation and the Survival of U.S. Urban Public Hospitals|journal=Medical Care Research and Review|language=en|volume=71|issue=3|pages=243–260|doi=10.1177/1077558713515079|pmid=24362646}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many public hospitals also develop programs for illness prevention with the goal of reducing the cost of care for low-income patients and the hospital, involving Community Health Needs Assessment and identifying and addressing the social, economic, environmental, and individual behavioral determinants of health.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

For-profit hospitals were more likely to provide profitable medical services and less likely to provide medical services that were relatively unprofitable.  Government or public hospitals were more likely to offer relatively unprofitable medical services.  Not-for-profit hospitals often fell in the middle between public and for-profit hospitals in the types of medical services they provided. For-profit hospitals were quicker to respond to changes in profitability of medical services than the other two types of hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Horwitz J.R. |title=Making Profits And Providing Care: Comparing Nonprofit, For-Profit, And Government Hospitals |journal=Health Affairs |volume=24 |issue=3 |year=2005 |pages=790–801 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.3.790 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/3/790 |format=Abstract |accessdate=2007-05-14 |pmid=15886174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public hospitals in America are closing at a much faster rate than hospitals overall. The number of public hospitals in major suburbs declined 27% (134 to 98) from 1996 to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washtimes.com/business/20050816-102614-7824r.htm|title=Public hospitals decline swiftly|author=Higgins, M.|date=17 August 2005|accessdate=2007-05-14|publisher=The Washington Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much research has proven the increase in uninsured and Medicaid enrollment entwined to unmet needs for  disproportionate share subsidies to be associated with the challenges faced by public hospitals to maintain their financial viability as they compete with the private sector for paying patients. Since the creation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010, 15 million of the 48 million previously uninsured receive Medicaid. It is projected that this number will grow to about 33 million by 2018.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The provision of good quality ambulatory specialty care for these uninsured and Medicaid enrolled patients has particularly been a challenge for many urban public hospitals. This accounts for many factors ranging from a shortage of specialists who are more likely to practice in the more profitable sectors than in the safety-net, to the lack of clinical space. To overcome this challenge, some public hospitals have adopted disease prevention methods, the increase of specialty providers and clinics, deployment of nurse practitioners and physician assistants in specialty clinics, asynchronous electronic consultations, [[telehealth]], the integration of [[Primary care|Primary Care Providers]] (PCP) in the specialty clinics, and referral by PCP's to specialists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makaroun|first=Lena K.|last2=Bowman|first2=Chelsea|last3=Duan|first3=Kevin|last4=Handley|first4=Nathan|last5=Wheeler|first5=Daniel J.|last6=Pierluissi|first6=Edgar|last7=Chen|first7=Alice Hm|date=2017-02-24|title=Specialty Care Access in the Safety Net—the Role of Public Hospitals and Health Systems|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/648778|journal=Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved|volume=28|issue=1|pages=566–581|doi=10.1353/hpu.2017.0040|pmid=28239019|issn=1548-6869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---soft copy and hard copy are NOT the same article but contain essentially the same information as stated---&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6130">The '''Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h103-3841&amp;tab=summary IBBEA summary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-103hr3841enr/pdf/BILLS-103hr3841enr.pdf IBBEA full text (final version)]&lt;/ref&gt; [IBBEA] amended the laws governing federally chartered banks in order to restore the laws' competitiveness with the recently relaxed laws governing ''state''-chartered banks. The goal was the return to a balance between the benefits of a state bank charter versus a federal bank charter. Among other notable changes, the Act stipulated that a federally chartered bank wishing to expand must first undergo a review of its [[Community Reinvestment Act]] compliance.&lt;ref&gt;IBBEA sections 107 and 110&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Expansion of the Community Reinvestment Act==
{{Copy section to Wikisource}}
Three sections of the IBBEA address and expand the [[Community Reinvestment Act]].

In section 107&lt;ref&gt;H.R.3841 (final version) page 24&lt;/ref&gt; ("EQUALIZING COMPETITIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN BANKS"):
:(f) MEETING COMMUNITY CREDIT NEEDS.
::Section 5(a) of the International Banking Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3103(a)) (as amended by section 104 of this Act) is amended by inserting after paragraph (7) the following new paragraph:
:::(8) CONTINUING REQUIREMENT FOR MEETING COMMUNITY CREDIT NEEDS AFTER INITIAL INTERSTATE ENTRY BY ACQUISITION.
::::(A) IN GENERAL.—If a foreign bank acquires a bank or a branch of a bank, in a State in which the foreign bank does not maintain a branch, and such acquired bank is, or is part of, a regulated financial institution (as defined in section 803 of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977), the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 shall continue to apply to each branch of the foreign bank which results from the acquisition as if such branch were a regulated financial institution.

In section 109&lt;ref&gt;H.R.3841 (final version) pages 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; ("PROHIBITION AGAINST DEPOSIT PRODUCTION OFFICES"):
:(b) GUIDELINES FOR MEETING CREDIT NEEDS. Regulations issued under subsection (a) shall include guidelines to ensure that interstate branches operated by an out-of-State bank in a host State are reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities which the branches serve.
:(c) LIMITATION ON OUT-OF-STATE LOANS.
::(1) LIMITATION.—Regulations issued under subsection (a) shall require that, beginning no earlier than 1 year after establishment or acquisition of an interstate branch or branches in a host State by an out-of-State bank, if the appropriate Federal banking agency for the out-of-State bank determines that the bank’s level of lending in the host State relative to the deposits from the host State (as reasonably determinable from available information including the agency’s sampling of the bank’s loan files during an examination or such data as is otherwise available) is less than half the average of total loans in the host State relative to total deposits from the host State (as determinable from relevant sources) for all banks the home State of which is such State--
:::(A) the appropriate Federal banking agency for the out-of-State bank shall review the loan portfolio of the bank and determine whether the bank is reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank in the host State; and
:::(B) if the agency determines that the out-of-State bank is not reasonably helping to meet those needs
::::(i) the agency may order that an interstate branch or branches of such bank in the host State be closed unless the bank provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the appropriate Federal banking agency that the bank has an acceptable plan that will reason ably help to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank in the host State, and
::::(ii) the out-of-State bank may not open a new interstate branch in the host State unless the bank provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the appropriate Federal banking agency that the bank will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the community that the new branch will serve.
:[...]
::(2) CONSIDERATIONS.—In making a determination under paragraph (1)(A), the appropriate Federal banking agency shall consider—
:::(A) whether the interstate branch or branches of the out-of-State bank were formerly part of a failed or failing depository institution;
:::(B) whether the interstate branch was acquired under circumstances where there was a low loan-to-deposit ratio because of the nature of the acquired institution’s business or loan portfolio;
:::(C) whether the interstate branch or branches of the out-of-State bank have a higher concentration of commercial or credit card lending, trust services, or other specialized activities;
:::(D) the ratings received by the out-of-State bank under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977;
:[...]

Section 110&lt;ref&gt;H.R.3841 (final version) page 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; ("COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT EVALUATION OF BANKS WITH INTERSTATE BRANCHES") amends the Community Reinvestment Act itself to include a new section regarding the method of evaluating the compliance of banks with branches in more than one state.

==Effect==
Newly formed firms used less outside debt financing and invested less, suggesting that greater banking competition increased financial constraints for these firms. These effects diminished and ultimately reversed as firms aged.&lt;ref name="Zarutskie paper"&gt;R. Zarutskie, ''Evidence on the effects of bank competition on firm borrowing and investment'', Journal of Financial Economics 81, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate on extending the franchise==
Since the 1990s there have been proposals to allow emigrants to vote in elections to the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] (lower house) or Seanad, generally via a dedicated ([[single transferable vote]] multi-seat) [[constituency]].&lt;ref name="Honohan2011"&gt;Honohan 2011 p.14 of preprint&lt;/ref&gt; Groups established by [[economic migrant|economic emigrant]]s leaving the [[Economic history of the Republic of Ireland#1980 to early 1990s|1980s recession]] have advocated for change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/abroad/generation-emigration/why-it-is-finally-time-to-give-irish-emigrants-the-vote-1.2420289|title=Why it is finally time to give Irish emigrants the vote|last=Hickman|first=Mary|date=10 November 2015|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related issue is a proposed right of people in [[Northern Ireland]] to vote in the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Oireachtas All-party committee on the Constitution p.40&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments in favour of expatriates voting include the economic and cultural importance of the [[Irish diaspora]] and the potential benefits of increasing its engagement with the state, and a moral debt owed to reluctant emigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Honohan 2011 pp.15–16 of preprint&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments against include the possibility of the emigrant vote swamping residents, and that emigrants' views may conflict with residents', as evinced by [[Irish American]] support for [[NORAID]] during [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="Honohan16"&gt;Honohan 2011 p.16 of preprint&lt;/ref&gt; Of 70 million nonresidents claiming Irish ancestry, 3 million have [[Irish nationality law|Irish citizenship]] including 1 million who have lived in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Honohan16"/&gt; Most proposals would enfranchise only the subset of this 1 million who left Ireland a limited time before. The number is still large relative to a resident population (including children) of 4.8 million;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/pme/populationandmigrationestimatesapril2017/|title=Population and Migration Estimates|date=April 2017|publisher=[[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]]|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however,  Iseult Honohan suggests that swamping could be prevented by making emigrants vote in a dedicated emigrants' constituency rather than in the constituency of their last Irish residence, so that expatriates would have lower [[apportionment (politics)|apportionment]] than residents.&lt;ref name="Honohan16"/&gt; The [[Government of Ireland|Irish government]] is [[Responsible government|responsible]] to the Dáil, so proposals to allow expatriates to vote for the Seanad or the [[figurehead]] office of [[President of Ireland|President]] would provide symbolic inclusion without jeopardising government stability.

==Official consideration==
The [[Oireachtas]] (parliament) committee on the constitution considered the matter in 2002; it recommended no extension of the franchise, but that among the [[Nominated members of Seanad Éireann|senators nominated by the Taoiseach]] (prime minister) should be "a person or persons with an awareness of emigrant issues".&lt;ref&gt;Oireachtas All-party committee on the Constitution p.59&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitutional Convention (Ireland)|Constitutional Convention]] in 2013 recommended allowing expatriate citizens to vote in [[Irish presidential election|presidential election]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.constitution.ie/AttachmentDownload.ashx?mid=bf489ec7-9556-e311-8571-005056a32ee4|title=Fifth Report: Amending the Constitution to give citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in Presidential elections at Irish embassies, or otherwise|date=November 2013|publisher=Convention on the Constitution|accessdate=23 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106112520/https://www.constitution.ie/AttachmentDownload.ashx?mid=bf489ec7-9556-e311-8571-005056a32ee4|archivedate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the government agreed to this, published a [[position paper]] listing seven options for eligibility criteria and associated implementation measures, and promised a [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|constitutional referendum]] on whichever option it would select, to be held alongside the [[Irish local elections, 2019|2019 local election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://merrionstreet.ie/en/News-Room/Releases/Coveney_publishes_an_Options_Paper_on_extending_the_eligibility_for_citizens_resident_outside_the_State_to_vote_at_presidential_elections.html |title=Coveney publishes an Options Paper on extending the eligibility for citizens resident outside the State to vote at presidential elections |date=22 March 2017|work=MerrionStreet|publisher=Government of Ireland|accessdate=23 April 2018}}; {{Cite press release |url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/News/Taoiseach's_Press_Releases/Announcement_by_the_Taoiseach_on_Voting_Rights_in_Presidential_Elections_for_Irish_Citizens_outside_the_State.html |title=Announcement by the Taoiseach on Voting Rights in Presidential Elections for Irish Citizens outside the State |last=Ruth |first=Maguire |publisher=Department of the Taoiseach |access-date=2017-03-23}}; {{cite web|url=https://www.kildarestreet.com/wrans/?id=2018-04-17a.4040#g4046.r|title=Postal Voting|date=17 April 2018|work=Written answers|publisher=KildareStreet.com|accessdate=23 April 2018|quote=the proposed referendum on extending the franchise at presidential elections to Irish citizens resident outside the State which it is intended will be held on the same date as the local and European elections in late May/early June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Oireachtas joint committee on [[European Union]] affairs considered a [[European Commission]] communication on "the consequences of disenfranchisement of Union citizens exercising [[Citizens’ Rights Directive|their right to free movement]]", and recommended that Irish citizens abroad should have the right to vote in Dáil elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/committees/euaffairs/archiveeuaffairs/Final-Voting-Rights-report_07112014.pdf |format=PDF|title=Report on Voting Rights of Irish Citizens Abroad‌‌|author=Joint Committee on European Union Affairs|date=November 2014|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=23 April 2018}}; {{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/irish-emigrants-should-have-right-to-vote-report-says-1.1999308|title=Irish emigrants should have right to vote, report says|last=Kenny|first=Ciara|date=13 November 2014|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a report on reform of the Seanad commissioned by the [[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]] recommended that senators on [[vocational panel]]s should be directly rather than [[indirect election|indirectly]] elected, from an electorate extended "to Irish citizens in [[Northern Ireland]] and to holders of [[Irish passport]]s living overseas".&lt;ref&gt;Working Group On Seanad Reform 2015, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudolf Elmer''' (born 1 November 1955) is a Swiss private banker, [[whistleblower]], and activist. He worked as a banker at [[Julius Baer Group|Julius Bär]] from the 1980s to his dismissal in 2002. At the time of his leaving, he was head of the bank's [[Caribbean]] operations for eight years. After initial, unsuccessful attempts to disclose client information in 2005, he was arrested by Zürich authorities and held for 30 days.&lt;!-- The lack of citations is purposeful.

In 2008, Elmer illegally disclosed confidential bank documents to [[WikiLeaks]] detailing the activities of Julius Bär in the [[Cayman Islands]] and its role in alleged [[tax evasion]]. In January 2011, he was convicted in [[Switzerland]] of breaching secrecy laws and other offenses. He was rearrested immediately thereafter for having again distributed illegally obtained data to WikiLeaks. Julius Bär as well as select Swiss and German newspapers alleges that Elmer has doctored evidence to suggest the bank engaged in tax evasion.

== Julius Bär ==
[[File:Zürich - Augustinergasse IMG 2046.JPG|thumb|Elmer worked in [[Julius Baer Group|Julius Bär]]'s [[Zürich]] offices until he was fired for stealing documents in 2002.]]
Elmer was hired by Swiss bank [[Julius Baer Group|Julius Bär]] during the early 1980s as a private banker in their [[Zürich]] offices. He worked at the bank as a private banker throughout the 1980s and 1990s before leading the bank's [[Caribbean]] operations from 1994 to 2002. In late 2001, Julius Bär internal security discovered that internal data had been stolen and required that every employee take a [[polygraph|lie detector test]] for involvement. Elmer did not take the test the first time around due to his health and then later failed. He was then released from employment on these grounds, although he was still in possession of backup copies of data. According to the bank it was "data theft committed with criminal intent".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srf.ch/player/video?id=5d70a102-0940-4bb5-af77-77602a5d2781 Gestohlene Bankdaten] Video in: [[Rundschau (SRF)|Rundschau]] vom 2.

April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After his resignation, he sent documents to various media, whereupon the bank called for an investigation of him and his family. In 2005, Elmer sold a Swiss business newspaper a CD with 169 megabytes of customer data, but was arrested shortly afterwards in Zurich on suspicion of violating [[Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks|Swiss banking secrecy law]]. He sat 30 days in custody. Soon after his parole he started a website for whistleblowers.&lt;ref name="zeit_nest"&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2011-01/wikileaks-schweiz-bankgeheimnis-2/komplettansicht ''Vom Banker zum Nestbeschmutzer.''] from: ''[[Zeit Online]].'' 18. January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 2008 the German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' revealed that Elmer was the source of documents that appeared some weeks earlier on WikiLeaks; ''Der Spiegel'' referred to them as partly authentic and partly fake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-56047401.html Spiegel, 2008-03-03, German]&lt;/ref&gt; A California judge had the service provider of WikiLeaks block the site's domain (wikileaks.org) on behalf of Julius Bär on 18 February 2008, although the bank only wanted the documents to be removed. According Swiss television documentary show [[Rundschau]], Elmer accused his bank of evading taxes by declaring bank work to have been carried out in the Cayman Islands, whereas the work was actually done in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="spon" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srf.ch/player/tv/rundschau/video/gestohlene-bankdaten?id=5d70a102-0940-4bb5-af77-77602a5d2781 Rundschau documentary 2008-02-04, german]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Elmer released internal bank documents with customer data and other sensitive details to the Wikileaks website.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.parlament.ch/d/suche/seiten/geschaefte.aspx?gesch_id=20083121 Bank Julius Bär, die Cayman-Inseln und der Whistleblower Rudolf Elmer] auf: ''parlament.ch'', 19. März 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to these allegations, Julius Bär held their customers funds by funneling through investment frameworks of offshore accounts to increase profits for themselves and circumvent the Swiss tax authorities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Julius Bär denied this in a statement saying that all of its activities in the [[Cayman Islands]] were legal and did not violate of Swiss banking regulations.&lt;ref name="spon" /&gt; On 17 January 2011, Elmer met with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks at a press conference at London's [[Frontline Club]] to hand over two disks in public view of reporters. The records included information on 2000 account holders and came from three financial institutions, including Julius Bär. Assange said the data would be reviewed and published in full.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzz.ch/julian_assange_unterstuetzt_banker_rudolf_elmer_video_1.9138649.html|title=Julian Assange unterstützt Banker Rudolf Elmer|date=18 January 2011|work=[[NZZ Online]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122111328/http://www.nzz.ch/julian_assange_unterstuetzt_banker_rudolf_elmer_video_1.9138649.html|archive-date=22 January 2011|type=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dw"&gt;[http://www.dw.de/schweizer-%C3%BCbergibt-bankdaten-an-wikileaks/a-14772150-1 ''Schweizer übergibt Bankdaten an Wikileaks.''] In: ''[[DW-World.de]]'', 17.

=== First trial ===
[[File:Zürich_Paradeplatz.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Z%C3%BCrich_Paradeplatz.jpg|thumb|Elmer faced his first trial at the Zurich District Court. ]]

On 19 January 2011, Elmer was ordered to answer before the Zurich District Court for breach of banking and business secrecy laws as well as a charge of coercion.&lt;ref name="spon" /&gt; Elmer was accused several times by bank employees to have harmed "by violence and the threat of serious consequences" and supposedly a bomb threat against the main building of the bank. In addition, he was tried for 2004 accusations of attempting to blackmail the bank of [[United States dollar|US$]]50,000, which did not respond to his offer.&lt;ref name="spon" /&gt; The publications on WikiLeaks were not part of the prosecution.&lt;ref name="sf"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110810223758/http://www.tagesschau.sf.tv/Nachrichten/Archiv/2011/01/12/Schweiz/Wikileaks-Star-kommt-vor-Zuercher-Gericht Wikileaks-Star kommt vor Zürcher Gericht] in: [[Schweizer Fernsehen]] vom 12. Januar 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor demanded a prison term of eight months without parole and a fine of 2,000 Swiss francs.&lt;ref name="tagi"&gt;[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/schweiz/standard/Richter-Elmer-ist-ein-Whistleblower-aus-Rache/story/27297908 Richter: Elmer ist ein Whistleblower aus Rache] In: ''[[Tages-Anzeiger]].'' 19. Januar 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Elmer was sentenced to probation for a period of two years and fined about 5,600 euros on multiple counts of attempted coercion, threats and breaching of banking secrecy. He also was ordered to pay three-quarters of the court fees in the amount of 5,000 francs (about 3,900 euros).&lt;ref name="tagi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sf_zweiteinstanz"&gt;[http://www.srf.ch/player/tv/news-clip/video/fall-elmer-schlappe-fuer-zuercher-staatsanwalt?id=5f3a8f54-4661-4aac-9729-d561c7cd6135 Fall Elmer: Schlappe für Zürcher Staatsanwalt.] In: [[Schweizer Fernsehen]] vom 17. November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The presiding judge believed that Elmer had not become a whistleblower for ethical reasons, but for personal revenge: "You were for many years part of the banking world and have benefited from it."&lt;ref name="tagi" /&gt; On the same day of his conviction Elmer was arrested on renewed suspicion of violation of Swiss banking secrecy. Elmer had two days earlier handed over two disks with data of suspected bank customers to Julian Assange of WikiLeaks for publication as well as remanded data collection, which was published on WikiLeaks. On 22 January 2011, Elmer was brought into custody on the grounds of urgent suspicion and risk of collusion. Elmer appealed to the Supreme Court of the Canton of Zurich against the detention order. Elmer was summoned on 16 February 2011 before the court and testified that the disks were empty and thus contained no bank customer data. The court found Elmer's presentation as "totally unbelievable" and rejected the appeal due to the danger of collusion. In July 2011, the remanding was extended until October 2011. On 25 July 2011, Elmer was released from custody.&lt;ref name="berufung"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111123232938/http://www.tagesschau.sf.tv/Nachrichten/Archiv/2011/01/20/Schweiz/Ex-Banker-legt-Berufung-gegen-Urteil-ein Ex-Banker legt Berufung gegen Urteil ein] in: [[Schweizer Fernsehen]] vom 20.

März 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; After he left court he was re-arrested in connection with handing data to WikiLeaks only two days earlier, a move that was described by the prosecutor of the first case as [[contempt of court]]. On 25 July 2011, Elmer was set free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.aargauerzeitung.ch/ipad/articleView.htm?article=bGluZTJfTkFUX2xpbmUyLTE0XzA4XzIwMTFfU29ubnRhZ19SZWRha3Rpb25fdjFfNjQxMjgx Rudolf Elmer ist frei] in: [[Der Sonntag (Schweiz)|Der Sonntag]] vom 14. August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second trial===
[[File:Inside the Reef Cayman.jpg|thumb|Elmer alleged that [[Julius Baer Group|Julius Bär]] noted activities done in Switzerland as if they were done in the [[Cayman Islands]].]]
On 17 November 2011, an appeal hearing was held at the Supreme Court of the Canton of Zurich. The Court made no judgment and sent the indictment back to the prosecutor and that it must review the investigation and supplement if necessary. As justification, the court stated that besides Elmer and the Bank, no one knew if this data actually existed in reality on the disks. It was difficult to decipher what data was actually on the disks. The judgment depends on whether the data from Swiss customers are from Switzerland, or those of the Cayman Islands, where the Swiss banking secrecy rights could not be applied. Thus, the bank was asked to explain the exact content of the CDs, which it had not done before.&lt;ref name="sf_zweiteinstanz" /&gt; If Elmer is correct and dealing with "Cayman - data" he would be acquitted of charges of bank secrecy violation. Banking secrecy in the Cayman Islands is potentially punishable, although not ''per se'' in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="tagi_berufungsverhandlung" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/startseite/kein-schweizer-recht-auf-den-cayman-inseln-1.13356548 Kein Schweizer Recht auf den Cayman-Inseln.] In: ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]].'' 19. November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the court found that there was insufficient evidence that Elmer authored a "significant threat" against a legal services employee of the bank. In an e-mail from Mauritius, the sender threatened the employee, and claimed he was a killer and recognized him. It was not enough that Elmer had then lived and worked in Mauritius. It must be clarified where the email was sent directly from and who sent it. It is up to the prosecutor to obtain the necessary evidence.&lt;ref name="tagi_berufungsverhandlung" /&gt; Elmer began a protest display outside the bank. While outside the bank he was routinely under surveillance by private detectives. It is alleged that the bank offered Elmer a monetary incentive to end his display.&lt;ref name="tagi_berufungsverhandlung"&gt;[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/gemeinden/Schlappe-fuer-Anklaeger-im-Fall-Elmer/story/13907541 Schlappe für Ankläger im Fall Elmer.] In: ''[[Tages-Anzeiger]].'' 22.

November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, the Zurich High Court ruled in an interim decision that three CDs that Elmer is said to have sent to the tax authorities or the business newspaper "Cash" may be unsealed and evaluated by the prosecution. The bank renounced the possibility of lodging an appeal against this decision.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Knellwolf: [http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/ipad/wirtschaft/Der-lange-Weg-einer-JuliusBaerCD-/story/18824837 Der lange Weg einer Julius-Bär-CD.] In: ''[[Tages-Anzeiger]].'' 8. Juni 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme Court of Switzerland===
The criminal chamber of the Federal Court on 10 October 2018 - after a public hearing before judges (lasting 150 minutes - without the parties present) - by 3 votes to 2 gave a groundbreaking judgment in the case of Rudolf Elmer regarding violation of bank secrecy, and other matters. Most importantly, the charge of violation of Swiss bank secrecy alleged against the well-known whistleblower Elmer brought by the Higher Prosecution Office of the canton of Zurich was rejected by the Federal court and the acquittal of Rudolf Elmer by the High Court of the Canton of Zurich was confirmed. The Federal Court also upheld the complaint by Rudolf Elmer concerning the imposition of an advance payment for the release of confiscated data and documents as well as the modalities for the return of the personal data of the Elmer family. His complaint against the imposition of three-quarters of the costs of the case, including the investigation costs, in the amount of CHF 320,000, and against the penalty for convictions for document forgery and threatening behaviour, were rejected by the Federal court.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-10/baer-whistleblower-to-learn-fate-in-war-over-cayman-data-leak, https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/10/18/a-court-ruling-knocks-another-hole-in-swiss-banking-secrecy

==Impact==
The Swiss newspaper ''Der Sonntag'' wrote in a December 2010 article that Elmer had confessed to threatening to kill several bank employees. Elmer said: "I have certainly made mistakes. My emotions have been out of control."&lt;ref name="sf" /&gt; The newspaper also alleged that Elmer had forged several documents, which would damage his credibility as a whistleblower.&lt;ref name="sf" /&gt; Also, the bank alleged that erroneous data about customers was given to WikiLeaks.&lt;ref name="sf" /&gt; WikiLeaks had to apologize in at least one case to an individual involved.&lt;ref name="sf" /&gt; On his computer a letter to the right-wing party NPD in Germany was found, in which Elmer offered the party certain documents. Elmer reported the letter was never sent.&lt;ref name="sf" /&gt;

Constantin Seibt wrote in the ''Tages-Anzeiger'': "Rudolf Elmer is the model case of a whistleblower. He is no angel. Almost all whistleblowers are complex cases. They betray their companies not only from a sense of justice, but also for other reasons, such as wounded pride and grievances. And get caught up in it. The more that the case involves their lives, the more destructive is their struggle: dismissal, years of court cases, divorces, financial ruin - the impact of whistleblowing has similar consequences to a serious crime than a good deed".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/schweiz/standard/Elmer-und-die-Uiguren-Bank-of-Switzerland/story/20502212 ''Elmer und die Uiguren Bank of Switzerland.''] In: ''[[Tages-Anzeiger]].'' 22. Januar 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, the Swiss Press Council received a complaint from Elmer on the weekly magazine ''World Week'' (WW). Journalist Alex Baur dubbed Elmer as a "thief" and "blackmailer" and sought to confront him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blick.ch/news/wirtschaft/beschwerde-rudolf-elmers-gegen-weltwoche-teilweise-gutgeheissen-id1960303.html Beschwerde Rudolf Elmers gegen «Weltwoche» teilweise gutgeheissen.] auf: ''[[blick.ch]]'', 12.

''For the films, see [[Short Time (film)|Short Time]].''

'''Short-time working''', '''short time''', or '''short-timers''' are terms used in both civilian employee and in U.S. military contexts.

==Civilian usage==

'''Short-time working''' or '''short time''' is a situation or system in which civilian employees agree to or are forced to accept a reduction in [[working time]] and pay.&lt;ref name="oxforddictionaries.com"&gt;http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/short-time?q=short+time&lt;/ref&gt;  The term can refer to short-term, [[recession]]-related programs operating in several European countries in which companies have entered into an agreement to avoid laying off any of their employees by instead reducing the working hours of all or most of their employees, with the government making up some of the employees' lost income. Employees who undergo training programs during their extra time off can often maintain their former incomes.

In [[Austria]], the introduction of short time (''{{lang|de|Kurzarbeit}}'' in German) requires a special arrangement between what are called the 'social partners' of Austrian collective bargaining (which is to say, the [[Chamber of Commerce]] and the [[labour union]]s), who negotiate on behalf of the employer and affected staff the scope of the ''{{lang|de|Kurzarbeit}}'' arrangement in terms of the staff covered, the maximum period of its application, the conditions for any lay-offs during the arrangement, and the scope of any professional training or re-training courses included.&lt;ref name="ILO report"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.internationallawoffice.com/Newsletters/detail.aspx?g=607c619c-c36b-4f41-b914-25db79c7c482 | title = ''Kurzarbeit'': an Alternative to Lay-Offs | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2010-09-20 | publisher = International Law Office |author=Jakob Widner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Germany|German]] government had budgeted 5.1 billion euros on the program, which replaced some of the lost income of over 1.4 million workers. The program was favorably cited in a 2009 [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) report, which stated that it had saved nearly 500,000 jobs during the recession.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/employment/emp/43707146.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GermanInfo1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.german-info.com/press_shownews.php?pid=1638 | title = Germany's 'Kurzarbeit' program a possible role model for other countries | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2010-09-24 | publisher = German Information Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research?|date=July 2013}} Besides helping to avoid mass layoffs, proponents of the program also cite its keeping skilled work groups together and avoiding the atrophy of their skills during extended layoffs, while critics have expressed concerns about its expense and that it might prop up non-viable firms.&lt;ref name="GermanInfo2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.german-info.com/business_workingermany_shownews.php?pos=Reduced%20hours%20save%20jobs,%20for%20now&amp;pid=37 | title = Reduced hours save jobs, for now | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2010-09-24 | publisher = German Information Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research?|date=July 2013}}

==U.S. military usage==
In U.S. military parlance, the term [[The Short-Timers#.22Short.22 vs. .22lifer.22 vs. .22poge.22|"'''short'''" or "'''short-timer'''"]] was coined during the [[Vietnam War]] era to describe personnel approaching the end of their tour and/or term of service. In ''Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans'' (1984), Specialist 5 Harold "Light Bulb" Bryant, Combat Engineer with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] of the U.S. Army in [[An Khe District|An Khe]] from February 1966-February 1967 relates:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Terry|first=Wallace|title=Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans|location=New York|publisher=Random House|year=1984|isbn=0-394-53028-4|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''We were in a fire fight one morning. We had our [[mad minute]] at six o'clock. We received some fire, and so we just started shooting.  I guess maybe about eight o'clock a [[Dustoff|dust-off]] came in to take out a wounded guy.  And they came and asked for me, and they told me that I was rotating.  Going home right in the middle of the fire fight.  I hadn't kept up with my days.  I didn't have a short-time calendar.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{distinguish|Economic, social and cultural rights}}

'''Social rights''' are those [[rights]] arising from the [[social contract]], in contrast to [[natural rights]] which arise from the [[natural law]], but before the establishment of [[legal rights]] by [[positive law]]. For example, [[James Madison]] advocated that a right such as [[trial by jury]] arose neither from nature nor from a [[constitution]] of government, but from [[Concretization|reified]] implications of the [[social contract]].&lt;ref&gt;Introduction of the Bill of Rights in congress, 1789 Jun 8, Jul 21, Aug 13, 18-19; Annals 1:424-50, 661-65, 707-17, 757-59, 766.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cecile Fabre]] argues that "it is legitimate to constrain democratic majorities, by way of the constitution, to respect and promote those fundamental rights of ours that protect the secure exercise of our autonomy and enable us to achieve well-being. Insofar as, by virtue of Ch. 1, social rights are such fundamental rights, it follows that they should be constitutionalized."&lt;ref&gt;Fabre, Cecile. "3. Constitutional Social Rights." Social Rights Under the Constitution 1: 67-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a legal standpoint several approaches exercise and guarantee social rights; social rights under the constitution are rights of subjects or "subject rights". This assures that the public receives equal distribution of collective and private interests.&lt;ref&gt;Societies Without Borders; Jul2009, Vol. 4 Issue 2, p158-174, 17p&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=April 2011}}

'''''Symphony of Dialogue''''' (2009) by the [[Turkey|Turkish]] composer [[Evrim Demirel]] reflects the composer's influences on both contemporary Western and traditional Turkish music.  The piece based on the dialogue of diverse cultures; it embraces Christianity, Judaism and Islam in one work of art and conveys their peaceful messages through the music. The novelty of the “Symphony of Dialogue” is having a traditional Qur'an singer in a western way of composed music.

“Symphony of Dialogue” is a pure message of peace and love through the music, which is entirely humanistic in its nature.

==Composition==
Musical voyage starts on a steady sustained chord which appears throughout the piece. Stationary chord is interrupted by the timpani hits amplified with the piano. Interruptions evolve new textures and drag the piece into the more anxious musical territories. Steady and unsteady musical structures interact each other through the piece and the singers endeavor to keep music in a more restful atmosphere.

==Form==
A symbolic expression from the birth to the death of the human being is moulded the form of the work. First tenor solo salutes people by singing a masnavi poem “ Merhaba” which is a part of Mawlid written by Süleyman Çelebi, refers to the observance of the birth of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. Then soprano delivers the message from the Bible that says “ I become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal if I have no love”. Restful messages of the religions continues through the voice of the baritone who vocalize a Psalm from the Old Testament that expresses, “love will follow me all the days of my life”. Eventually three vocalists conclude the music with a poem by [[Yunus Emre]].

:''“Let us be lovers and the loved ones,”''
:''“The earth shall be left to no one.”''

'''''The Rats''''' is a [[government simulation game]] and [[survival horror]] [[Interactive fiction|text adventure]] game that runs on the [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] computers. It is based on the [[The Rats (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[James Herbert]]. The game was programmed by GXT (Five Ways Software),&lt;ref name=crafrt /&gt; and published by [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]], who were the publishers of [[James Herbert|James Herbert's]] book ''[[The Rats (novel)|The Rats]]''.&lt;ref name=sinuse /&gt; An [[Amstrad CPC]] version was planned, but was never released.

==Gameplay==
The game is generally played as a simulation that allow the player to strategically send emergency forces (rat exterminators, police men, fire men and eventually army troops) to areas where the rat threat has spread and provide them with available equipment. Also the player can get ten available researchers to develop addition weapons, defences and super weapons to keep the rats at bay and to provide useful information to progress in the game. Should the rat threat reach beyond the London limits, the Research centre, the Government centre or Harris' apartment or if all emergency forces are lost, the game is over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mocagh.org/miscgame/rats-manual.pdf |title=James Herbert's The Rats |work=[[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In between the simulation game play, the game will suddenly switch to the role of a playable character in a randomly chosen text adventure scenario. The player has to select one or more verbal options to perform actions to allow the character to survive against the rat threat and avoid getting killed. While it is not crucial to keep the characters alive, saving them grants the player additional reinforcements and research to aid against the rat threat. However, if one of the main characters Harris, Howard or Foskins dies, the game is over.&lt;ref name=crafrt /&gt;

'''Thurrock Independents''' is a [[Political faction|group]] of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[politician]]s in [[Thurrock]], [[Essex]] that was formed after its members broke away from the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) in January 2018.  The group had seventeen members, including UKIP [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Tim Aker]], and forms the opposition group on [[Thurrock Council]].  The group was created after all seventeen members of the council's UKIP group left the party, saying they had "had enough of the aggressive and bitter reality of party politics". 

In 2018, the former party leadership defected to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] party; and were followed soon after by two incumbent councillors who joined the Conservative Group in November 2018. Following losses in the [[2018 local election]], this left the party with just ten councillors. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-42830757 |title=Thurrock's 17 UKIP councillors all resign from party |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=26 January 2018 |accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Tim Aker joined his council colleagues in the new group, he subsequently stated that he would continue to represent UKIP in the [[European Parliament]] for the purposes of [[Brexit]]: "UKIP has a job to do in the European Parliament in seeing we get the Brexit we voted for. I will stay as a UKIP MEP. But to better represent my constituents in Aveley, I had no choice but to follow my colleagues and represent the Thurrock Independents." This situation led to some uncertainty about the status of some of the group's members as a number of them work for Aker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yourthurrock.com/2018/01/26/tim-aker-remain-ukip-mep-member-new-thurrock-independent-party/|title=Tim Aker to remain a UKIP MEP and a member of the new Thurrock Independents |work=Your Thurrock|publisher=|date=26 January 2018|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
