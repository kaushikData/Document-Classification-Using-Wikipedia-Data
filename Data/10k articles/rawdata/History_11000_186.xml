{{Campaignbox Falklands War}}

On 2 April 1982, [[Military of Argentina|Argentine forces]] launched the '''invasion of the Falkland Islands''' ({{lang-es|Islas Malvinas}}), beginning the [[Falklands War]]. The Argentines mounted amphibious landings, and the invasion ended with the surrender of [[Government House (Falkland Islands)|Government House]].

==Defence==
Governor [[Rex Hunt (governor)|Rex Hunt]] was informed by the [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]] of a possible Argentine invasion on 1 April 1982. At 3:30 pm that day he received a telegram from the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] stating:

{{quote|We have apparently reliable evidence that an Argentine task force could be assembling off Stanley at dawn tomorrow. You will wish to make your dispositions accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/uk/2002/falklands/my_story/hunt.stm | publisher = BBC | title = Hunt: My Falklands Story | year = 2002 | accessdate=2009-12-31 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Forces involved===
The Governor summoned the two senior [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] officers of Naval Party 8901 to Government House in Stanley to discuss the options for defending the Falklands. He said during the meeting: "Sounds like the buggers mean it".&lt;ref name = "Bound"&gt;Bound, Graham, ''Falkland Islanders at war'', Pen and Sword Books Limited, {{ISBN|1-84415-429-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major Mike Norman was given overall command of the Marines due to his seniority, while Major Gary Noott became the military advisor to Governor Hunt. The total strength was 68 Marines and 11 sailors, which was greater than would normally have been available because the garrison was in the process of changing over – both the replacements and the troops preparing to leave were in the Falklands at the time of the invasion.&lt;ref name="Battles: The Argentine Invasion"&gt;[http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.5874 Battles: The Argentine Invasion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908175426/http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.5874 |date=2007-09-08 }} royalnavy.mod.uk. Accessed 26 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was decreased to 57 when 22 Royal Marines embarked aboard the [[Antarctic]] patrol ship HMS ''[[HMS Endurance (1967)|Endurance]]'' to observe Argentine soldiers based at [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]]. The [[Royal Navy]], and author Russell Phillips state that a total of 85 marines were present at Stanley.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070203170641/http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.5874 The Argentine Invasion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"Consequently, there were 85 Royal Marines on the islands, with 25 men of the Falkland Islands Defence Force, although some retired members of the FIDF also reported for duty that around 40 men were available for the FIDF."'' A Damn Close-Run Thing, Russell Phillips, Shilka Publishing, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Their numbers were reinforced by at least 25 [[Falkland Islands Defence Force]] (FIDF) members.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Graham Bound, an islander who lived through the [[Occupation of the Falkland Islands|Argentine occupation]], reports in his book ''Falkland Islanders At War'' that the higher figure of 40&lt;ref&gt;''"Meanwhile the Falkland Islands Defence Force (FIDF) was preparing for the invasion quite independently of the Marines. Their OC, Major Phil Summers, had tasked the approximately forty parttime militiamen to guard such key points as the telephone exchange, the radio station and the power station."'' Invasion 1982: The Falkland Islanders' Story, Graham Bound, Page 45,  Casemate Publishers, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (including 15 ex-FIDF members&lt;ref&gt;''"Consequently, there were 85 Royal Marines on the islands, with 25 men of the Falkland Islands Defence Force, although some retired members of the FIDF also reported for duty that around 40 men were available for the FIDF."'' A Damn Close-Run Thing, Russell Phillips, Shilka Publishing, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) members of the FIDF reported for duty at their drill hall. Their commanding officer, Major Phil Summers, tasked the volunteer militiamen (including his son Brian Summers) with guarding such key points as the [[telephone exchange]], the [[radio station]] and the [[power station]]. Skipper Jack Sollis, on board the civilian coastal ship ''Forrest'', operated his boat as an improvised radar screen station off Stanley. Two other civilians, former Royal Marines Jim Fairfield and a Canadian citizen, Bill Curtiss, also offered their services to the governor.&lt;ref name= Insight/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Mutch |first=James |title=Britain's secret weapon in the Falklands War reunited with former comrades |url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/15211816.Britain_s_secret_weapon_in_the_Falklands_War_reunited_with_former_comrades/ |date=10 April 2017 |publisher=The Bolton News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the main Argentine landings, the British sailors under orders from the Chief Secretary, Dick Baker, rounded up 30 Argentine nationals living in Port Stanley, placing them in protective custody.&lt;ref&gt;''Led by Colour Sergeant J. Noone RM, and accompanied by the Chief Secretary as the representative of the civil power, they had rounded up thirty Argentine nationals residents in Port Stanley by 4.00am, placing them in protective custody.''

==Operation ''Rosario''==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of military operations]] --&gt;
[[File:ARASantísimaTrinidadD-2.jpg|thumb|300px|The Argentine [[Type 42 destroyer|Type-42 destroyer]] ARA ''Santísima Trinidad'']]

The Argentine amphibious operation began in the late evening of Thursday 1 April, when the [[destroyer]] [[ARA Santísima Trinidad (1974)|ARA ''Santisima Trinidad '']] disembarked special naval forces south of Stanley. The bulk of the Argentine force was to land some hours later from the [[tank landing ship|amphibious warfare ship]] [[ARA Cabo San Antonio (Q-42)|ARA ''Cabo San Antonio'']] near the airport, on a beach previously marked by frogmen from the submarine [[ARA Santa Fe (S-21)|ARA ''Santa Fe'']].&lt;ref name=may/&gt;

The operation had been called ''Azul'' (Blue) during the planning stage, but it was finally renamed ''Rosario'' ([[Rosary]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz Moreno, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===ARA ''Santa Fe''===
Operation ''Rosario'' began with the reconnaissance of [[Port William, Falkland Islands|Port William]] by the submarine ARA ''Santa Fe'' and the landing of 14 members of the [[Buzos Tácticos|tactical divers group]] near Cape Pembroke, including the commander of this elite unit, Lieutenant-Commander Alfredo Raúl Cufré. The reconnaissance mission began as early as 31 March, when the trawler ''Forrest'' was spotted through the periscope at 10:00 PM off Port Stanley. The next day, ''Santa Fe'' learned that the authorities in Stanley were aware of the Argentine plans, so a change was necessary. Instead of landing right on Pembroke, the commandos would initially take a beach near Menguera Point, south of [[Kidney Island]].&lt;ref name="Bóveda, Jorge 2007 pp. 56"&gt;Bóveda, Jorge (2007). ''La Odisea del submarino Santa Fe''. IPN editores, pp. 56, 75–76. {{ISBN|978-950-899-073-0}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nuestromar.org"&gt;[http://www.nuestromar.org/noticias/mar_calmo9269_072007_valio_la_pena_alfredo_cufre_primer_soldado_que_piso_malvinas#prof''La Voz del Interior'' newspaper, 1 April 2007] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commandos left ''Santa Fe'' at 1:40 PM. From the beach, the special troops headed towards Pembroke peninsula in [[Inflatable boat|Zodiac boat]]s. They reached [[Yorke Bay]] at 4:30 AM of 2 April. After planting beacons for the main landing, they took over the airstrip and the lighthouse without resistance. Argentine sources claim that they captured a few prisoners. After the British surrender at Port Stanley, this team was given the task of gathering the Royal Marines and taking them into custody.&lt;ref name="Bóveda, Jorge 2007 pp. 56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nuestromar.org"/&gt;

===Attack on Moody Brook barracks===
On the night of 1-2 April 1982, ''Santísima Trinidad'' halted 500 metres off Mullet Creek and lowered 21 [[Rigid-hulled inflatable boat|Gemini assault craft]] into the water. They contained 84 special forces troopers&lt;ref&gt;Busser, ''Operación Rosario''. The force was composed of 76 Amphibious Commandos and 8 members of the ''[[Buzos Tácticos]]'' (tactical divers) elite group.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Lieutenant-Commander]] Guillermo Sánchez-Sabarots's [[Comandos Anfibios|1st Amphibious Commandos Group]] and a small party&lt;ref&gt;The so-called ''Patrulla Techo'' (''Roof patrol'').&lt;/ref&gt; under Lieutenant-Commander [[Pedro Giachino]], who was normally second-in-command of the [[Argentine Marine Corps|1st Marine Infantry Battalion]], that was to capture Government House.&lt;ref name=small&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Falklands/NP8901.html#prof|title=Naval Party 8901 And the Argentine Invasion (Britain's small wars)|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010080020/http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Falklands/NP8901.html#prof|archivedate=2006-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Argentine Rear Admiral [[Jorge Allara]], through a message radioed from ''Santisima Trinidad'', had requested to Rex Hunt a peaceful surrender, but the proposal was rejected.&lt;ref name=small/&gt;

Giachino's party had the shortest distance to go: two and a half miles due north. [[Moody Brook]] Barracks, the destination of the main party, was six miles away, over rough terrain. Lieutenant-Commander Sánchez-Sabarots, in the book ''The Argentine Fight for the Falklands'', describes the main party's progress in the dark:

{{quote|It was a nice night, with a moon, but the cloud covered the moon for most of the time. It was very hard going with our heavy loads; it was hot work. We eventually became split up into three groups. We only had one [[Night vision goggles|night sight]]; the lead man, Lieutenant Arias had it. One of the groups became separated when a vehicle came along the track we had to cross. We thought it was a military patrol. Another group lost contact, and the third separation was caused by someone going too fast. This caused my second in command, Lieutenant Bardi, to fall. He suffered a hairline fracture of the ankle and had to be left behind with a man to help him. We were at Moody Brook by 5.30 a.m., just on the limits of the time planned, but with no time for the one hour's reconnaissance for which we had hoped.&lt;ref name=mil/&gt;}}

The main party of Argentine Marines assumed that the Moody Brook Barracks contained sleeping Royal Marines. The barracks were quiet, although a light was on in the office of the Royal Marine commander. No sentries were observed, and it was a quiet night, apart from the occasional animal call. Lieutenant-Commander Sánchez-Sabarots could hear nothing of any action at Government House, nor from the distant landing beaches; nevertheless, he ordered the assault to begin. Lieutenant-Commander Sánchez-Sabarots continues his account:

{{quote|It was still completely dark. We were going to use tear-gas to force the British out of the buildings and capture them. Our orders were not to cause casualties if possible. That was the most difficult mission of my career. All our training as commandos was to fight aggressively and inflict maximum casualties on the enemy. We surrounded the barracks with machine-gun teams, leaving only one escape route along the peninsula north of Stanley Harbour. Anyone who did get away would not able to reach the town and reinforce the British there. Then we threw the gas grenades into each building. There was no reaction; the barracks were empty.&lt;ref name=mil/&gt;}}

The noise of the grenades alerted Major Norman to the presence of Argentines on the island, and he thus drove back to Government House. Realising that the attack was coming from Moody Brook, he ordered all troop sections to converge on the house to enable the defence to be centralised.&lt;ref name = "Bound"/&gt;

Although there were no Royal Marine witnesses to the assault, British descriptions of the state of Moody Brook barracks afterwards contradict the Argentine version of events. After the Royal Marines were allowed to return to barracks to collect personal items. Major Norman describes walls of the barracks as riddled with machine gun fire and bearing the marks of [[white phosphorus]] grenades—"a classic houseclearing operation".&lt;ref name = "Bound" /&gt; The Argentines maintain that the barracks were destroyed in an air attack on 12 June (involving Flight Lieutenant Mark Hare and Wing Commander Peter Squire) that killed three conscripts (Privates  Mario Gustavo Rodriguez, Carlos Gustavo Mosto and Ignacio Maria Indino from 10th Brigade Headquarters) and wounded their commander, Major José Rodolfo Banetta.&lt;ref&gt;''"El día anterior el fuego británico había alcanzado los cuarteles de Moody Brook, donde mató a tres soldados e hirió al mayor José Rodolfo Banetta, de la compañía comando de la Brigada X."'' Isidoro J. Ruiz Moreno, La Lucha Por La Capital (chapter), Comandos en Acción: El Ejercito en Malvinas, Emece, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"El Jefe de Personal del Comando de las Fuerzas Terrestres que, hasta ese entonces, había permanecido con su Sección en el Cuartel de los Marines (Moody Brook), el Mayor del Ejército Don José R. Banetta, que debía replegarse de las instalaciones mencionadas hacia su Puesto de Comando Principal en la localidad, al incendiarse y destruirse los cuarteles, por un efectivo y preciso ataque de la aviación enemiga."'' Carlos H. Robacio, Jorge Hernández, p. 216, Desde el Frente: Batallón de Infantería de Marina No. 5, Centro Naval, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"Los ataques aéreos continuaban pero en forma cada vez más esporádica, quizá el último bombardeo importante fue sobre el ex-cuartel de los Royal Marines en Moody Brooki donde funcionaba el PC Ret de la Agr Ej a órdenes del My Banetta. Produjo bajas y grandes daños en el cuartel."'' Horacio Rodríguez Mottino, p. 182, La Artillería Argentina en Malvinas, Clio, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amphibious landing at Yorke Bay===
There was a more pressing action on the eastern edge of [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]]. Twenty US-built [[Amphibious Assault Vehicle|LVTP-7A1]] Argentine tracked amphibious armoured personnel carriers from Lieutenant-Commander Guillermo Cazzaniga's 1st Amphibious Vehicles Battalion, carrying D and E Companies of the 2nd Marine Infantry Battalion (BIM-2) from [[Puerto Belgrano]], had been landed from the tank landing ship ARA ''Cabo San Antonio'' at Yorke Bay, and were being watched by a section of Royal Marines under the command of Lieutenant Bill Trollope. Two Argentine-built landing crafts (Numbers 09 and 23), also took part in the landings later that morning and would fall into British hands at the end of the fighting in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aposmalvinas.com.ar/ftoumh01.htm|title=Free Web Hosting, Domain Hosting, Reliable Web Hosting Provider, Domain registration, Inexpensive, Low Cost, Affordable, Reseller Program, PHP, MySQL, Linux, Ecommerce|website=www.aposmalvinas.com.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The armoured column trundled along the Airport Road into Stanley, with three Amtracs (Numbers 05, 07 and 19) in the vanguard, and, near the Ionospheric Research Station, at exactly 7:15 am, was engaged by a section of Royal Marines with anti-tank rockets and machine guns. This is from Lieutenant-Commander Hugo Santillán's official post-battle report:

{{quote|We were on the last stretch of the road into Stanley. A machine-gun fired from one of the three white houses about 500 metres away and hit the right-hand Amtrac. The fire was very accurate. Then there were some explosions from a rocket launcher, but they were inaccurate, falling a long way from us. We followed our standard operating procedure and took evasive action. The Amtrac on the right returned fire and took cover in a little depression. Once he was out of danger, I told all three vehicles to disembark their men. I ordered the crew with the [[recoilless rifle]] to fire one round of [[HEAT|hollow charge]] at the ridge of the roof of the house where the machine-gun was, to cause a bang but not an explosion. We were still following our orders not to inflict casualties. The first round was about a hundred metres short, but the second hit the roof. The British troops then threw a purple [[smoke grenade]]; I thought it was their signal to withdraw. They had stopped firing, so Commander Weinstabl started the movement of the two companies around the position. Some riflemen in one of the houses started firing then; that was quite uncomfortable. I couldn't pinpoint their location, but one of my other Amtracs could and asked permission to open up with a [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] which he had. I authorized this, but only with three rounds and only at the roofs of the houses. Two rounds fell short, but the third hit right in the centre of the roof; that was incredible. The British ceased firing then.&lt;ref name=mil&gt;Middlebrook, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Amtrac on the right manoeuvred itself off the road into a little depression and as it did so, disembarked the Marines inside (including one wounded, Private Horacio Tello&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacionsoldados.com.ar/modelismo/modelismo-010.html|title=Fundación Soldados|website=www.fundacionsoldados.com.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;) out of view. This encouraged the Royal Marines to think that Gibbs had scored a direct hit on the passenger compartment of the APC.

Lieutenant Bill Trollope, with No. 2 Section, describes the action:

{{quote|Six Armoured Personnel Carriers began advancing at speed down the Airport Road. The first APC was engaged at a range of about 200 to 250 metres. The first three missiles, two 84 mm and one 66 mm, missed. Subsequently one 66 mm fired by Marine Gibbs, hit the passenger compartment and one 84 mm Marines [George] Brown and [Danny] Betts hit the front. Both rounds exploded and no fire was received from that vehicle. The remaining five APCs which were about 600 to 700 metres away deployed their troops and opened fire. We engaged them with GPMG, SLR and sniper rifle [Sergeant Ernie Shepherd] for about a minute before we threw a white phosphorus smoke grenade and leap-frogged back to the cover of gardens. Incoming fire at that stage was fairly heavy, but mostly inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;Bound, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Governor Hunt in his ''memoirs'', Marines Brown and Betts brought the leading Amtrac to a screeching halt with a direct hit in one of the forward tracks while Marine Gibbs scored another hit in the passenger compartment:

{{quote|About this time, we received the heartening news that the section led by Mike's second-in-command, Bill Trollope, had knocked out the first APC. They put an 84mm rocket into the tracks and a 66mm rocket into the passenger compartment. They stood ready to shoot anybody who got out, but nobody did.&lt;ref&gt;My Falkland Days, Rex Hunt, p. 238, David &amp; Charles, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lieutenant Trollope and his men withdrew along Davis Street, running behind the houses with Argentine Marines in hot pursuit, and went to ground firing up the road when it became obvious they could not reach Government House.&lt;ref&gt;Bound, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporal Lou Armour, commanding '1 Section', was positioned at Hookers Point when the invasion began. Shortly after the attack on Moody Brook, he was ordered to withdraw to Government House, meeting up with Corporal David Carr's section along the way.

{{quote|The marines, now numbering sixteen, decided to try and work their way around to the back of the ridge where the Argentinians were positioned, and then charge down to Government House, hopefully taking the enemy by surprise. But as they moved through the edges of the town they came under fire at every street corner and it was eventually so heavy they had to abandon their plan.&lt;ref&gt;The Sunday Times Insight Team, 1982 p. 12. Sphere Books Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As both sections headed off to find Lieutenant Trollope's men, Corporal Armour decided to have one more try at getting into Government House. Using fire and maneuver to cross a football pitch they then crawled along the hedgerow leading to the gardens where they experienced [[Friendly fire]]. According to Corporal Armour:

{{quote|I had a running battle with a bunch of Argentines in armored vehicles who were chasing me and my section back toward Stanley. When we eventually got to government house, we were taking fire from three directions: the Argentines who were attacking the house, both behind and in front, and our own guys, who were in the house and thought we were another Argentine snatch squad trying to get in. So that was a bit hairy. An Argentine was killed that day and a few more wounded.&lt;ref name="vice.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7bmz4d/minefield-royal-court-theatre-falkland-war-876|title=Soldiers Who Fought Each Other in the Falklands War Are Now Sharing a Stage|website=Vice}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

They eventually made it to safety via the kitchen door. Corporal Armour again:

{{quote|One Section pepper-potted down the road towards the wood where we knew Government House to be. Movement was slow as we had to crawl and monkey run until we reached the hospital. It was now broad daylight. From there the section fired and manoeuvred behind the nurses' home and across the football pitch until we reached a hedgegrow. I informed Marine Parker to call out, 'Royal Marines!' as we approached the house. We were eventually heard by Corporal Pares, who told us where the enemy were. The section, under cover from Corporal Pares, then dashed into the house where we were deployed upstairs by Major Noott.&lt;ref name="Graham Bound p. 54"&gt;Graham Bound, Invasion 1982: The Falkland Islanders' Story, p. 54, Casemate Publishers, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the meantime, Corporal Stefan York and No 6 Section had been patiently manning their hide on the western end of Navy Point. As the Argentine landing crafts approached Stanley Harbour, Marine Rick Overall fired a [[Carl Gustaf recoilless rifle|Carl Gustav anti-tank]]  round that the British claimed penetrated the side of an Argentine Marine [[Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel|LCVP]], killing all on board.&lt;ref&gt;Operation Corporate (Viking, 1985), Martin Middlebrook, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Government House and surrender===
Lying on a small hillock south of Government House, Lieutenant-Commander [[Pedro Giachino]] faced the difficulty of capturing this important objective with no radio and with a force of only 16 men. He split his force into small groups, placing one on either side of the house and one at the rear. Unknown to them, the governor's residence was the main concentration point of the Royal Marines, who outnumbered the commandos by over two to one.

The first attack against this building came at 6.30 a.m., barely an hour before the Yorke Bay amphibious landing, when one of Giachino's squads, led by Lieutenant Gustavo Adolfo Lugo,&lt;ref&gt;Busser, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; started to exchange fire with the British troops inside the house. At the same time, Giachino himself, with four of his subordinates, entered the servants' annexe, believing it to be the rear entrance to the residence. Four Royal Marines, [[Corporal]]s Mick Sellen and Fleet and Marines Harry Dorey and Murray Paterson,&lt;ref&gt;''"Corporal Mick Sellen, who with Marine Paterson had shot the three Argentines in the chicken run, had reported to Gary that he had seen three others make for the staff quarters, and he suspected that they were still there."'' My Falkland Days, Rex Hunt, p. 233, David &amp; Charles, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; who were placed to cover the annexe, beat off the first attack. Giachino was hit instantly as he burst through the door, while Lieutenant Diego Garcia Quiroga was shot in the arm. The remaining three retreated to the maid's quarters.

Giachino was not dead, but very badly wounded. An Argentine combat medic, Corporal Ernesto Urbina, attempted to get to Giachino but was wounded by a grenade. Giachino, seeing what had happened, pulled the pin from a hand grenade and threatened to use it. The Royal Marines then attempted to persuade the officer to get rid of the grenade so that they could give him medical treatment, but he refused, preventing them from reaching his position. After the surrender of the British forces at Government House, some three hours later, Major Giachino was taken to Stanley Hospital but died from loss of blood.&lt;ref&gt;Busser, page 277&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:P33ARAGranville.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Drummond class corvette|ARA ''Granville'']]]]
At the governor's office, Major Norman received a radio report from Corporal York's section, which was positioned at Camber peninsula, observing any possible Argentine ship entering Stanley Harbour. The corporal proceeded to report on three potential targets in sight and which should he engage first. ''What are the targets?'' the major enquired. ''Target number one is an aircraft carrier, target number two is a cruiser'', at which point the line went dead.

Corporal York decided to withdraw his section and proceeded to [[booby trap]] their [[Carl Gustav recoilless rifle]], before paddling their [[Rigid-hulled inflatable boat|Gemini assault boat]] north across Port William. As he did so, York claimed an Argentine destroyer began pursuing them (the [[D'Estienne d'Orves class|corvette]] ARA ''Granville'' according to Argentine sources). His initiative led to the Gemini reaching an anchored [[People's Republic of Poland|Polish]] fishing vessel, hiding the small assault boat under her shadow. They patiently waited for a chance, before moving to the shore and landing on a small beach.&lt;ref name=small/&gt;

Back at Government House, the Argentine commandos' pressure continued unabated. There is some evidence that their use of stun grenades, mistaken as high-explosive rifle-grenades and/or mortars,&lt;ref&gt;''"The noise for a while was deafening. It numbed the senses, like an anaesthetic, and made thinking a conscious effort. We surmised later that the Argentines were throwing stun grenades but, at the time, we thought we were being mortared. Outbursts of automatic and rifle fire interspersed the bangs. My first rational thought was surprise that the windows had not shattered. My second was to wonder why we had no pieces of metal flying round."'' My Falkland Days, Rex Hunt, p. 226, David &amp; Charles, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and their continuous shift of firing positions during the battle led the Royal Marines inside to believe they were facing a large company of marines and were hopelessly outnumbered. Actually, after the failure of Giachino's small platoon to break into the residence, the British were surrounded by only a dozen amphibious commandos. These men were under Lieutenant Lugo, Giachino's [[Second-in-Command|second-in-command]]. The [[Land Rover]]s used by the Royal Marines were disabled by [[Automatic firearm|automatic gunfire]] from the commandos.&lt;ref&gt;Insight team Sunday Time (1982), Chapter VIII: ''An Ungentlemanly Act'', p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Hunt called Patrick Watts (at the radio station, Radio Stanley), by telephone and said he believed the assaulting force to be the equivalent of a reinforced company:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We're staying put here, but we are pinned down. We can't move.(...) They must have 200 around us now. They've been throwing rifle grenades at us; I think there may be mortars, I don't know. They came along very quickly and very close, and then they retreated. Maybe they are waiting until the APCs [Amtracs] come along and they think they'll lose less casualties that way.&lt;ref&gt;Bound, page 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Way, p. 134, increases the number of Argentine troops around the House to 600.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Insight team Sunday Time (1982), Chapter VIII: ''An Ungentlemanly Act'', p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Corporals Geordie Gill and Terry Pares, both snipers, also claimed to have shot several Argentines through the chest and head as they attempted to scatter along the hillside overlooking Government House:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We dropped a number of Argentinians as they approached and I had a couple in my sights and made sure they were taken out of the game. It was initially estimated that we had killed five and injured seventeen, but we only counted the bodies that we saw drop in front of us.&lt;ref&gt;David Reynolds, p. 21, Task force: The Illustrated History of the Falklands War, Sutton, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Major Norman's estimate is that Corporals Pares and Gills killed or wounded some four or five Argentine special forces:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Corporals Pares and Gill, were doing an excellent job. Gill would look through his sniper scope and tell Pares where the enemy were and Pares would fire ten rounds rapid, and as soon as that got them on the move, Gill would take them out with the sniper rifle. They took out four or five this way and all the time they were giving the rest of us a running commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Max Arthur, p. 17, Above All, Courage: The Falklands Front Line: First-Hand Accounts, Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, 1985
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the official history of both sides, Argentine casualties are listed as one killed and three badly wounded outside Government House. Another three Argentine Marines (Private Horacio Tello, Padre Ángel Maffezini and Lieutenant-Commander Hugo Santillan) were slightly wounded or injured taking cover in the skirmishes in and around Port Stanley.

Around 7.30 a.m., the local police commander Ronnie Lamb, had to order two RFIP (Royal Falkland Islands Police) officers to nearby Government House, in order to rescue a civilian, Henry Halliday, as he blissfully  headed off to work, despite the fierce gun-battle taking place all around him.&lt;ref&gt;"Yesterday morning Ronnie Lamb, the police chief, had to get his officers to rescue old Henry Halliday from the front road, as he had set off for work as usual, through the main part of the invasion, just after seven." 74 Days: An Islander's Diary of the Falklands Occupation, John Smith, p. 33. Century, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Hunt decided to enter talks with Argentine commanders around 8:30 am after Major Norman warned him ''"that our defence would be determined, unrelenting-but would be relatively short-lived"''.&lt;ref&gt;''"At 0830 Major Norman advised the Governor on various military options. He realised that the enemy had overwhelming numerical superiority and although he would have liked to break out, taking the Governor with him, and set up a seat of Government elsewhere in the
Islands, he had no doubt that if they continued as they were, they would be soon overrun. He told the Governor 'that our defence would be determined, unrelenting-but would be relatively short-lived'. The Governor got in touch with Vice Commodore Hector Gilobert, the Argentine representative of Lade, and asked his help in contacting the Argentine Commander, Admiral Carlos Busser."'' [https://theroyalmarinescharity.org.uk/news/this-weeks-globe-laurel-julyaugust-1982/ THIS WEEK'S GLOBE &amp; LAUREL - July/August 1982]&lt;/ref&gt;The liaison was Vice-Commodore Hector Gilobert, the head in the islands of [[LADE]], the Argentine government's airline company. Gilobert and a governor's deputy went to the Argentine [[headquarters]] displaying a white flag. A de facto ceasefire was put in place at that time which was occasionally breached by small arms fire.&lt;ref&gt;Insight team Sunday Time (1982), Chapter I: ''Surrender (I)'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The governor's envoys found the Argentine command post at Stanley's town hall. The Argentine commander accepted the British offer of a face to face meeting with Hunt at his battered office.

While the negotiations were still going on, another incident occurred inside the residence. Three Argentine amphibious commandos who survived the first skirmish along the compound inadvertently alerted Major Noott to their presence, while they had been preparing to leave their hiding place. The Major fired his [[Sterling submachine gun]] into the ceiling of the maid's room. According to British reports, the stunned commandos tumbled down the stairs, laying their weapons on the ground. They became the first Argentine [[Prisoner of War|prisoners of war]] of the Falklands War, although by then Governor Hunt had already been in contact with Argentine officials negotiating the terms of surrender.&lt;ref name="Busser, page 40"&gt;Busser, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The version of Lieutenant Commander Cufré, who was then at Stanley airport, is that the three Amphibious Commandos supporting Giachino's party kept their positions right to the end of the hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;Insight team Sunday Time (1982), Chapter I: ''Surrender (I)'', page 20. Instead, in an article published by an Argentine newspaper, the 1982 commander of the Tactical Divers Group (''Buzos Tácticos'') states that the three men withstood a fierce three-hour gun battle with the Royal Marines.[http://www.nuestromar.org/noticias/mar_calmo9269_072007_valio_la_pena_alfredo_cufre_primer_soldado_que_piso_malvinas#prof ''La Voz del Interior'' newspaper, 1 April 2007] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiral Carlos Büsser, commander in chief of the operation, states that a ceasefire was already in place when the three commandos, after realising that the battle was coming to a close and that any loss of life at the time would be futile, laid down their arms to the marines in order to assist the wounded. Just a few minutes after this event, Government House capitulated.&lt;ref name="Busser, page 40" /&gt;

====Surrender====
Meanwhile, the Royal Marines in the house saw the approaching Amtracs that had been engaged earlier by Lieutenant Trollope and his section. The Amtracs were Rex Hunt's biggest problem, because they could take up positions outside the  range of the Royal Marines and blast Government House to pieces.&lt;ref&gt;''"The Amtracks were the Marines' biggest problem, because they could stand off outside the British troops' range and blast Government House to pieces. After telephoning various people in Port Stanley to ascertain the outside situation, Governor Hunt reluctantly agreed to see the commander of the Argentine forces present, Admiral Busser."'' The World's Elite Forces, Bruce Quarrie, p. 64, Berkley Books, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicles pushed on toward Moody Brook to link up with Sánchez-Sabarots. His amphibious commandos were plodding slowly along the road to reinforce their colleagues besieging Government House after taking some prisoners near the racecourse.&lt;ref&gt;''En su trayecto [el grupo de comandos] recibió la rendición de una patrulla de ocho soldados ingleses, en proximidades del Hipódromo, y momentos después se encontraron, de acuerdo con lo previsto y como hemos visto, con la Vanguardia de la Fuerza de Desembarco, que debía rastrillar la parte norte de la península de Camber''. Mayorga, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These troops seem to have been FIDF men on patrol around Stanley's racecourse in order to prevent helicopter landings ([https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/04/02/wfalk02.xml#prof Telegraph.co.uk]).&lt;/ref&gt; Major Norman had earlier advised Governor Hunt that the Royal Marines and the governor could break out to the countryside and set up a 'seat of government' elsewhere, but when he finally met the commander of the Argentine seaborne forces, Admiral Büsser, he agreed to surrender his troops to the now overwhelming Argentine forces at 9:30 am. It was a hard decision for Governor Hunt to make:
&lt;blockquote&gt; With a heavy heart, I turned to Mike and told him to give the order to lay down arms. I could not bring myself to use the word 'Surrender'. Mike's face was a mixture of relief and anguish: it was not part of his training to surrender, but his good sense told him that there was no real alternative. As Gary accompanied Busser to tend the wounded round Government House, Mike told his radio operator to instruct all sections to down arms and wait to be collected.&lt;ref&gt;Rex Hunt, p. 234, My Falkland Days, David &amp; Charles, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While Major Noott accompanied Busser outside Government House, the British officer applied morphine and the tourniquet on the Argentine wounded that would staunch the heavy bleeding and, Lieutenant Diego García Quiroga would later say Noott saved his life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lagaceta.com.ar/nota/330678/la-gaceta-literaria/buena-manana-para-morir.html Una buena mañana para morir]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt would later state in mid-April that the defenders fired 6,000 rounds in the fighting at Government House and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lak_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XlYMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6645,5386718&amp;dq=|title=The Robesonian |website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Falklands Governor disputed Argentine claims that the seaborne assault resulted in only one Argentine dead and two wounded; telling ''Time Magazine'' reporters Briton Hadden and Henry Robinson Luce in their 12 April 1982 article that at least five and possibly 15 invaders were killed and 17 were wounded in the invasion. According to Port Stanley resident John Pole Evans the napalm bombings on 21 April were part of the mock battles in Stanley Common that coincided with General Cristino Nicolaides&lt;ref&gt;''Cabe acotar que justo antes de la visita de los Comandantes fue a la isla el general Nicolaides y pasó la noche allí. Fue a visitar la Brigada de Infantería Mecanizada X perteneciente al Cuerpo de Ejército a su mando, y conversó con el general Jofre y conmigo. Visitó las unidades en sus emplazamientos, conversó con los jefes, etcétera.'' Malvinas: Testimonio de Su Gobernador, Mario Benjamín Menéndez, Carlos M. Túrolo, Page 100, Editorial Sudamericana, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;' visit as commander of the Argentine Army's 1st Corps:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We knew what sort of damage they could do, because during April whilst we were still in our homes, they'd bombed the Tussock Island in the harbour with napalm and it burned for a couple of days. This was like a warning of what they were capable of—that they could destroy the settlement if they wanted to. For them it was probably just some sort of target practice.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh McManners, Forgotten Voices of the Falklands: The Real Story of the Falklands War, Random House, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fearing that British had established an Observation Post on Tussock Island, Major Mario Castagneto's 601st Commando Company was sent to clear the island of enemy special forces, but returned empty handed and completely covered in black soot due to another Pucara napalm bombing on 1 May.&lt;ref&gt;''La Compañía de Comandos 601 era usada para las más variadas actividades. Por la mañana, y dado que se creía que desde allí se dirigía a los bombarderos, se habían dirigido a la isla Tussac, a la que le dieron el nombre de Isla Quemada porque un avión había arrojado una bomba de napalm sobre ella y regresaron negros de hollín de la turba que pisaron.'' Compilación Malvinas, Joaquín A Boccazzi, Page 138, Gráfica Sur, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

After the surrender, the Royal Marines and two rifle sections under Corporals Gerald Cheek and Pat Peck from the FIDF were then herded onto the playing fields.&lt;ref&gt;''We watched sadly as Argentine soldiers assembled our Royal Marines on the lawn in front of us. We were alarmed to see some members of the FIDF. They were Gerald Cheek's and Pat Peck's sections, who had been caught between the Argentines attacking Moody Brook and those surrounding Government House.'' My Falkland Days, Rex Hunt, Page 238, David &amp; Charles, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;Pictures and film were taken of the British prisoners arranged face-down on the ground. This was probably an attempt to demonstrate the lack of British casualties,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} but it backfired: The images galvanised the British public when they were broadcast on television and increased public opposition to the invasion. Corporal Armour's section had fought on the second floor&lt;ref name="Graham Bound p. 54"/&gt; at Government House and was taken prisoner: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;There were three casualties lying in the garden of Government House. You think: What sort of mood are they going to be in when their [[wikt:oppo|oppos]] are shot up? When we were actually lying down I felt a bit humiliated but I also felt apprehensive about what was going to happen next. One of the Argentine officers came along and actually struck one of the guards and told us to stand up. We stood up and he shook my hand and a few other guys' hands and said that we shouldn't lie down, that we should be proud of what we'd done."''&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bilton, Peter Kosminsky, p. 233, Speaking Out: Untold Stories From The Falklands War, Andre Deutsch, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Royal Marines had fought with bravery and skill for they had killed one of his best officers, Carlos Busser said.&lt;ref&gt;"The marines had fought with bravery and skill, Busser said. They had killed one of his best captains. Now they should lay down their arms. The appeal succeeded in that the governor decided he had no choice but to accept the inevitable." War in the Falklands: The Full Story, p. 20, Harper &amp; Row, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Now they could lay down their arms with their military honor intact. The appeal succeeded in that the governor decided he had no choice but to accept the inevitable. The Royal Marines were allowed, 10 at a time, to return to Moody Brook Barracks under armed guard and were given ten minutes to pack their personal belongings.&lt;ref&gt;"The Royal Marines were allowed, 10 at a time, to return to Moody Brook under supervision and were given ten minutes to pack non-service kit." [https://theroyalmarinescharity.org.uk/news/this-weeks-globe-laurel-julyaugust-1982/ THIS WEEK'S GLOBE &amp; LAUREL - July/August 1982]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The captured British servicemen were then allowed to collect personal items (but no uniform) from Moody Brook and were flown out to Comodoro Rivadavia that evening." The Royal Navy and Falklands War, David Brown, p.59, Pen &amp; Sword, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterward, the Royal Marines were moved to a [[C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft, which would take them to [[Comodoro Rivadavia]], where they were to be picked up by another airliner to [[Uruguay]] and on to the [[United Kingdom]]. Members of the FIDF were not taken to Argentina along with members of NP 8901; instead they were disarmed and returned to their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Bound, pp. 35 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Marines were being taken to [[Montevideo]], one of them said to an Argentine guard "don't make yourself too comfy here mate, we'll be back".&lt;ref name=small/&gt;

Corporal York's section remained at large. On 4 April, they reached Long Island Farm owned by a Mrs Watson. York had no radio, and due to worries about possible civilian deaths, chose to surrender to Argentine forces. They gave their position to the Argentine Army using a local islander's radio, and York subsequently ordered his men to destroy and then bury their weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Middlebrook, Martin (1985). ''Operation Corporate: the Falklands War, 1982''. Viking, p. 52. {{ISBN|0-670-80223-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major Patricio Dowling and a platoon from the 181 Military Police Company platoon were helicoptered forward and after roughly handling Yorke's men and posing for pictures, locked up the Royal Marines men in Stanley Police Station. Yorke's section would then be held in Comodoro Rivadavia along with Lieutenant Keith Mill's 22-man platoon and supporting 13-man British Antarctic Survey (BAS) detachment under Steve Martin captured in South Georgia.

In [[Buenos Aires]], huge flag-waving crowds flooded the [[Plaza de Mayo]] upon hearing the news. Argentina's losses in the operation were one dead and three wounded. In [[London]], where the bad news was fully known from Argentine sources, the government was in a state of shock. The crisis prompted the resignation of the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]], [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]].&lt;ref&gt;Theakston, Kevin (2004). ''British foreign secretaries since 1974''. Routledge, p. 134. {{ISBN|0-7146-5656-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|1982 invasion of South Georgia}}

The next day, Argentine forces captured the island chain of South Georgia, 1350&amp;nbsp;km to the east of the Falklands. In that action, the Argentines suffered one sailor from the corvette [[ARA Guerrico (P-32)|ARA ''Guerrico'']] and two marines killed (Navy Corporal Patricio Guanca and marine [[conscript]]s Mario Almonacid and Jorge Aguila). One British Royal Marine was wounded in an exchange of fire with the Argentine troops. The Marines eventually surrendered when this position was bracketed by the ''Guerrico's'' main 100mm gun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Falklands/South-Georgia.html#prof Argentine Invasion of South Georgia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014125543/http://britains-smallwars.com/Falklands/South-Georgia.html |date=2007-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his stay in Comodoro Rivadavia, Corporal Lou Armour befriended two English-speaking Argentine conscripts, Edgardo Blaguerman and Mariano Tantignone at the Liceo Militar ''General Roca'' that had been converted into a Prisoner of War Camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diariopublicable.com/malvinas-30-anos/68-la-amistad-en-los-tiempos-de-la-guerra.html|title=La amistad en los tiempos de la guerra|first=|last=diariopublicable.com|website=www.diariopublicable.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Armour agreed to return to Argentina to take part in the Argentine play ''Minefield'' that brought the former enemies together in a reconciliation move.&lt;ref name="vice.com"/&gt;

==Resistance==

[[Terry Peck]], former Port Stanley Chief-of-Police and former member of the FIDF, set up a resistance base near Estancia House in April. He was soon joined by ex-Sergeant Neil Watson, Patrick Minto, Patrick Witney  and other ex-FIDF soldiers who armed themselves with the rifles and 66mm anti-tank rockets that Corporal Stefan York and his Marines had buried at Long Island Farm. Peck, Minto, Witney and others would later join Captain Matthew  Selfridge's D (Patrols) Company from 3 PARA at Douglas Settlement and help SAS/SBS teams secure Mounts Kent and Estancia.&lt;ref&gt;Newsweek (Volume 99, 1982), Newsweek Incorporated, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Terry Peck and Vernon Steen would act as guides in the 3 PARA patrols at Murrell Bridge sent out to reconnoitre the Argentine Mount Longdon stronghold.

==Reaction in the United Nations==
On 3 April 1982, the [[United Nations Security Council]] comprising the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]] and with Poland, Spain, Ireland, Panama, Guyana, Japan, Jordan, Uganda, Zaire, and Togo) passed the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 502|Resolution 502]] demanding an immediate withdrawal of all Argentine forces from the islands and called on the governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to seek a diplomatic solution to the situation and refrain from further military action. Panama voted against this resolution, with China, Poland, Spain and the Soviet Union abstaining. All 10 remaining members voted for the resolution.&lt;ref name="UN_SRES5021982"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-502(1982) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=1982 |resolution_number=502 |accessdate=2008-07-20|date=3 April 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informing London==
At 16:30 local time on 2 April 1982, the last [[telex]] conversation between the operator in the Falklands and an operative in London, announced that the islands were under Argentine control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Communications Cut With the Falklands |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/03/world/communications-cut-with-the-falklands.html |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=3 April 1982 |accessdate=2014-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Operation Azul.svg|center|600px|Operation ''Rosario''|thumb]]
The timeline of the operation was as follows:&lt;ref name=may&gt;Mayorga, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ordered list|
| list_style_type=upper-alpha
| 21:30 1 April – The [[Type 42 destroyer]] [[ARA Santísima Trinidad (1974)|ARA ''Santisima Trinidad '']] begins loading naval commandos of the [[Amphibious Commandos Group]] into 21 small inflatable motor boats. These set out for Mullet Creek but sail too far north and are caught up in beds of [[kelp]], which cause problems for the boats. They decide to head for the nearest beach, which is near Lake Point.
| 23:00 1 April – The first group of 84 men lands on an unnamed beach at Lake Point. The group splits into a smaller force led by Lieutenant-Commander Giachino which heads towards Government House, and a larger force commanded by Lieutenant-Commander Sabarots which heads towards Moody Brook barracks.
| 04:30 2 April – A small advanced team of the [[Buzos Tácticos|Tactical Divers Group]] is landed undetected from the Submarine [[ARA Santa Fe (S-21)|ARA ''Santa Fe'']] near Yorke Bay.
| 05:30 2 April – Lieutenant-Commander Sabarots' force reaches and surrounds the barracks. They throw grenades into the buildings and storm the buildings with heavy machine gun fire. They find the buildings deserted.
| 06:00 2 April – 20 [[FMC Amtrac]]s and several [[LARC-V]] stores-carrying vehicles land on Yorke Bay from the [[Landing Ship, Tank|LST]] [[ARA Cabo San Antonio (Q42)|ARA ''Cabo San Antonio'']]. The force splits into 3 groups:{{unordered list
 | A four Amtrac vanguard. Including one carrying the Army Platoon.
 | The main force of 14 Amtracs.
 | The second in command, a recovery Amtrac and LARC vehicles.
}}
| 06:30 2 April – The first Amtracs meet no resistance. The Army platoon secures the deserted airport, previously swept by Navy tactical divers.
| 06:30 2 April – An Argentine force of 16 naval commandos reaches Government House, where they are stopped by 31 Royal Marines, 11 armed Royal Navy personnel and 1 local. Three Argentines are wounded, including the leader of the platoon, Lieutenant-Commander Giachino, who later dies. Another three are later captured inside the House, although by then (around 8:00) talks with Argentine officials about the surrender had already begun.
| 07:15 2 April – Having met no resistance, the Argentine Amtracs advance on Stanley, when they are ambushed from a house about 500 metres from the road. Royal Marines use rockets and machine guns. The Royal Marines fall back to government house. One of the Amtracs is scarred by machine gun fire, and there is one minor injury.
| 08:30 2 April – The Argentine Amtrac force secures Stanley.
| Lieutenant Colonel Seineldín's Regiment 25th platoon begin to clear the runway, while Navy tactical divers provide security on the airport and seize the lighthouse.

'''Arthur Thomas Daniel Porter III''' (born 1924) is a retired [[Sierra Leone Creole people|Creole]] professor, historian, and author. His book on the Sierra Leone Creole people, ''Creoledom: A study of the development of Freetown society'', examines their society in a way in which few books of their time period had, and it is one of the most quoted books on the [[Sierra Leone Creole people|Creole]]s. He has also been published in East Africa and the UK.

==Early life==
Arthur Porter was born in 1924 in [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate|British Sierra Leone]], to Guy Hardesty Porter and Adelina Porter. Guy Porter was an electrical engineer who died as a civil servant. Adelina Porter was a school teacher at the Freetown Secondary School for Girls, which was attended by Porter's sister, Iyatunde Harriet Maria Palmer (''née'' Porter). Porter attended the Cathedral School in Freetown.

==Background==
Like many Creoles, Porter is of West Indian, [[Jamaican Maroon]], [[Sierra Leone Liberated Africans|Liberated African]], and [[Nova Scotian Settlers|Nova Scotian settler]] descent. His paternal grandfather was Arthur Thomas Porter I (1834–1908), a successful Creole businessman of West Indian and Jamaican Maroon parentage. The father of A. T. Porter I was Guy Porter, a West Indian immigrant to Sierra Leone via England, who became a headman of Kent Village. Guy Porter married a Maroon colonist. The Porter family house owned by A. T. Porter I was at No. 11 Wilberforce Street in the heart of Settler Town and near Zion Methodist Church.

Porter is also of "Settler" or Nova Scotian stock, by way of a [[Virginia]]n ancestor who had arrived in Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia. The Virginian had occupied a house in what the Nova Scotians called [[Settler Town, Sierra Leone|Settler Town]], Sierra Leone, and was one of the founders of Freetown. He is a graduate of the Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine in Cambridge, England.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120210130456/http://www.muhcfoundation.com/en/arthur_porter_e "Hon. Dr. Arthur T. Porter, P.C., M.D."], MUHC Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Porter married a woman from Denmark and had two children, Arthur and Emma. He is the grandfather of four girls: Gemma, Fiona, Adina and Charlotte. He lives in [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada, and he makes frequent trips back to his homeland, Sierra Leone. Porter's son, [[Arthur Porter (physician)|Arthur Porter IV]], was a Canadian physician and former Director General (CEO) of the [[McGill University Health Centre]].

==Legacy==
Porter's work on Sierra Leonean history is considered to be among the most scholarly work done on the people of his native Sierra Leone. Porter's analysis of the stratification of Creole society is considered the most authoritative work on the development of Creole society, and most scholars reference his book when researching the Creole people. The work he accomplished during his tenure at [[Fourah Bay College]] has made many look upon Porter as one in the mould of historian [[Christopher Fyfe]], Professor [[Eldred D. Jones]], Professor [[Akintola J. G. Wyse]], and linguist [[Leo Spitzer]].

After leaving his post as Vice-Principal of Fourah Bay College, Porter moved to [[East Africa]] and became Principal of the [[University College, Nairobi]], one of the three colleges of the [[University of East Africa]]. His term there ended in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;"Proceedings &amp; Papers of the International Conference on African Bibliography, Nairobi, 4-8 Dec. 1967", Patterson, J. D. and Jones, R. (eds).

The house of '''Baban''' (1649–1850) ruled a [[Kurdish principality]] which encompassed areas of present-day [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] and western Iran from the early 17th century until 1850. The Baban principality played an active role in Ottoman-Persian conflict. The founder of the princely Baban family is thought to be Ahmad Faqih or Faqi Ahmad from the district of Pijder.&lt;ref&gt;W. Behn, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baban-2 Baban], [[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Babans claimed descent from a [[Franks|Frankish]] woman, Keghan, who was taken prisoner in a battle by the Ottomans. According to the ''[[Sharafnama]]'' the clan's first chief was Pir Badak Babe, who is believed to have lived around 1500.&lt;ref&gt;M. Th. Houtsma, A.J. Wensinck, H.A.R. Gibb, W. Heffening and E. Levi-Provencal, First encyclopaedia of Islam (1993), Vol.VII, p.538, BRILL Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--The founder of the dynasty and its first ruler was Fakih Ahmed ({{lang-ar|Ahmad al-Fakih}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}). He also had a brother named Khidder Ahmed who lived with him. Fakih Ahmed Bey who was of a bold and proud spirit&lt;ref&gt;Serinity Young (1993), An Anthology of sacred texts by and about women, p. 124, crossroad&lt;/ref&gt; took a Frankish princess as his wife whom he met in Constantinople (present-day [[Istanbul]]), the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan{{Who|date=August 2011}} gave Fakih enormous hereditary land holdings in [[Kurdistan]]{{Clarify|date=August 2011}} as well as his blessing to wed his new bride, before his death he added the areas of [[Mergeh]] and [[Mawutt]] to his land and thus laid the foundation of the principality his descendents would build and rule.--&gt;

Baban princes retained some autonomy in return for providing security for the [[Ottoman Empire]] along the Iranian border. [[Sulaiman Baba|Sulaiman Beg]] was the first Baban prince to gain control of the province of Shahrizor and its capital, [[Kirkuk]]. He invaded Iran, defeating forces from the principality of [[Ardalan]] in 1694. Ottoman Sultan [[Mustafa II]] assigned him the district of Baban, which included the town of Kirkuk.&lt;ref&gt;Gábor Ágoston, Bruce Alan Masters (2009), ''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire'', p.70, Infobase Publishing, {{ISBN|9781438110257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Sulaimaniyah]] was founded by Baban prince Mahmud Pasha in 1781.&lt;ref&gt;W. Behn, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baban-2 Baban], [[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]&lt;/ref&gt; Baban rulers encouraged cultural and literary activities in their domain. During the first half of the 19th century a school of poetry was established under Baban patronage, of which classical Kurdish poet [[Nalî|Nali]] was the central figure.&lt;ref&gt;Farhad Shakely, ''The Kurdish Qasida'' in Stefan Sperl, P. M. Kurpershoek, C. Shackle (1996), ''The Poetry of Ad-Dindān: A Bedouin Bard in Southern Najd'', p.337, BRILL&lt;/ref&gt;
 
&lt;!--Their grandson became powerful in central and southern Kurdistan. Ahmad's successor, Baba Sulaiman extended his influence to [[Kirkuk]]. During the reign of Sulaiman Pasha, Baban rule was extended to [[Koi Sanjaq|Koya]], [[Khanaqin]], [[Arbil]], Harir, [[Altun Kupri]], [[Badra, Iraq|Badra]] and some areas of Eastern [[Kurdistan]] (western [[Iran]]). The headquarters of Baban was initially based at ''Qala Chuwalan'', and later it was moved to the newly founded city of [[Sulaimaniya]] in 1781 during the reign of Mahmud Pasha Baban. The region under Baban rule stretched from the [[Little Zab]] river to the [[Diyala River|Sirwan]].--&gt;
Baban princes aided Ottoman forces in Iranian wars from 1723–1746. From 1750 to 1847, Baban history was dominated by rivalries with other Kurdish principalities (such as [[Soran Emirate|Soran]] and [[Bohtan]]) and its opposition to centralization by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and the [[Qajars]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Behn, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baban-2 Baban], [[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]&lt;/ref&gt; The principality was destroyed during the mid-19th century Ottoman modernization period. The Baban revolt lasted for three years, but was defeated by a coalition of Ottoman forces and Kurdish tribes. [[Ahmed Pasha Baban]], the last Baban ruler, was defeated near Koya in 1847 and the region of [[Shahrazur]] was annexed to the Ottoman Empire. The last Baban prince left Sulaimaniya in 1850, after fighting the Turks for the independence of southern Kurdistan.&lt;ref&gt;Ely Banister Soane (2007), ''To Mesopotamia and Kurdistan in Disguise'', p.371, Cosimo, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian theological praxis''' is a term used by most [[liberation theology|liberation theologians]] to express how the [[Gospel]] of [[Jesus Christ]] is to be lived in the world. 

==Description==
Christian praxis is something that goes beyond practices, actions, or behaviors. Praxis is described as a combination of reflection and action that realizes the [[historicity]] of human persons. In this sense actions are realized in light of the way they affect history. History has to be seen as a whole, combining in an incarnational way, our [[salvation]] history and our "human" history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Sobrino]], "Communion, Conflict and Ecclesial Solidarity," Mysterium Liberationis (1993): 616.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expression==
Most liberation theologians see Christian theological praxis mainly as lived and expressed in the life of community. "Any discourse of faith starts from, and takes its bearings from, the Christian life of Community".&lt;ref name=Gutierrez&gt;[[Gustavo Gutierrez]], We drink from our own wells (Maryknoll/ Melbourne: Orbis Books/ Dove Communications, 1984), 37-8.&lt;/ref&gt; This is where a community is said to become an expression of the presence of the Kingdom of God, so long as it is being true to its calling to Christian praxis. This has been the vision shared by the [[basic ecclesial communities]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcelo Azevedo]], "Basic Ecclesial Communities, "Mysterium Liberationis (1993): 650.&lt;/ref&gt; which follow a pattern of Christian praxis based on what [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] said: "To be followers of Jesus requires that [we] walk with and be committed to the poor; when [we] do, [we] experience an encounter with the Lord who is simultaneously revealed and hidden in the faces of the poor".&lt;ref name=Gutierrez/&gt;

'''''Cyclops''''', "The First English Adult Comic Paper," was a "[[comic-strip]]" [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] published in [[London]] in 1970 by former International Times art editor Graham Keen working with Matt Hoffman an American, handling advertising and distribution. Published by Innocence &amp; Experience, ''Cyclops'' had national distribution and a large print run, but lasted only four issues.

In addition to reprinting comics by [[Spain Rodriguez]], [[Vaughn Bodē]], and [[Gilbert Shelton]], ''Cyclops'' also published original work by U.K. artists like Raymond Lowry, Edward Barker (also called "Edweird"), Mal Dean, David Jarrett, and Australian [[Martin Sharp]], a poster artist from ''[[OZ magazine|OZ]]'' magazine. Some early [[Alex Raymond]] ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' comics from the 1930s were reprinted as well.

Novelist [[M. John Harrison]], who would go on to become an exponent of the British [[New Wave science fiction|New Wave]], and literary editor of ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'', scripted comic stories which were illustrated by Richard Glynn Jones. American novelist [[William S. Burroughs]] scripted ''The Unspeakable Mr. Hart'', illustrated by Malcolm McNeill.

== History ==
Keen's photographs had appeared in ''IT'' and he became art editor in 1968. One of ''IT's'' founders, [[Barry Miles]], was an art college friend from Cheltenham College of Art.   In 1969/71 Keen lodged with Miles and his wife Sue in Lord North Street, London, and ran ''Cyclops'' from there.&lt;ref name="huxley"&gt;{{cite book | last=Huxley | first=David | title=Nasty Tales | publisher=Critical Vision (Headpress) | year=2001 | page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He managed to bring in [[William S. Burroughs]], who contributed ''The Unspeakable Mr. Hart''. Burroughs wanted Malcolm McNeill — at the time a senior student at the [[Hornsey College of Art]] who had not read much Burroughs — to do the artwork.

Price may have been a factor in the demise of ''Cyclops'': it cost three shillings (3/-) for 20p. of material, whereas the ''International Times'', with app. 24 pages cost 1/6 d; an average paperback 3/6 d., and an American comic 1/-.&lt;ref&gt;In 1971-72, the ''International Times'' published seven issues of another comic book, ''Nasty Tales'', concentrating on American reprints.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==

== ''Ah Pook Is Here'' ==
McNeill and Burroughs continued to work together for years, but only eleven pages (of an intended 120) of their ''[[Ah Pook Is Here]]'' were published, in ''Rush Magazine'' in 1976. [[John Calder]] and Viking produced a text-only version in the collection ''Ah Pook Is Here: And Other Texts.'' Burroughs admired the [[Maya codices]] and he and McNeill wanted to create "an unprecedented, full blown word/image novel." Only fragments of this project have been published and only online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burroughsmcneillart.com/history.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204015827/http://www.burroughsmcneillart.com/history.html |date=4 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlib.us/beats/malcolmmcneill.html |title=Malcolm McNeill Interview &amp;#124; William Burroughs, Ah Puch Is Here Artwork - Ah Pook&amp;#124; The Unspeakable Mr. Hart &amp;#124; London 1970s &amp;#124; by George Laughead, Beats In Kansas |publisher=Vlib.us |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigbridge.org/MCN-INT.HTM |title=Interview with Malcolm McNeill conducted by Larry Sawyer |publisher=Bigbridge.org |date=2008-01-20 |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realitystudio.org/interviews/interview-with-malcolm-mc-neill/ |title=Interview with Malcolm Mc Neill |publisher=RealityStudio |date=2007-09-05 |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Damaschin Bojincă''' (1802–1869) was an [[Habsburg Monarchy|Imperial Austrian]]-born [[Moldavia]]n writer and jurist.

Born into an [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] family in [[Goruia|Gârliște]], [[Caraș-Severin County]], he attended primary school in [[Oravița]] and [[Vršac]] (''Vârșeț''), finishing high school in [[Timișoara]]. Entering the Vršac theological seminary, he soon left the institution, preferring to study philosophy and later law in Timișoara, [[Oradea]] and [[Budapest]]. After receiving his law degree in 1824 and taking up work as a lawyer, he also began a cultural activity, working as an editor at ''Biblioteca românească'' in [[Buda]] under [[Zaharia Carcalechi]]. His preferred subjects were philology and history, in the latter field publishing ''Istoria românilor'' ("The History of the Romanians"), ''Istorie a lumii pe scurt'' ("Short History of the World"), and studies of rulers such as [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], [[Radu Șerban]] and [[Michael the Brave]]. The work to which he devoted the most time, that he considered his most important and that essentially capped his career in historiography was the 1832-1833 ''Anticile românilor'' ("Antiquities of the Romanians"). Moving to Moldavia in 1833, he remained there for the rest of his life, working as a lawyer, as rector of [[Iași]]'s [[Socola Monastery]] seminary and as a teacher at [[Academia Mihăileană]]. In 1860-1861, during the [[United Principalities]] period, he served as Justice Minister at Iași.&lt;ref&gt;Ionel Maftei, ''Personalități ieșene'', p.69.

[[Image:Chyträus,-David-2.jpg|thumb|David Chytraeus]]
'''David Chytraeus''' or '''Chyträus''' (26 February 1530, [[Ingelfingen]] &amp;ndash; 25 June 1600, [[Rostock]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Lutheran]] [[theologian]], reformer and [[historian]]. He was a disciple of Melancthon.

His real surname was Kochhafe, which in [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] is χυτρα, from where he derived the Latinized pseudonym "Chyträus".

Chytraeus was professor of the [[University of Rostock]] and one of the co-authors of the [[Formula of Concord]]. He is known for his work as the author of a Protestant catechism. His original Latin text was published in 1554, then reprinted in 1599. Now it has been translated for the first time in German. It has been published, together with editorial notes and commentary by Michael.&lt;ref&gt;Michael, Susi-Hilde. 2016. ''Der Katechismus des David Chytraeus''. Evangelische Verlagsanstalt.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author of a treatise on music, ''De Musica''.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Burmeister, ''Poétique musicale. Suivi de David Chytraeus – De la Musique'', translation, introduction, notes and lexicon by Agathe Sueur and Pascal Dubreuil, Rhuthmos, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dev-Kesken''', or '''Dev Kesken''' ''qala'', is an [[archaeological site]] in the [[Daşoguz Province|Dashoguz]] region of northern [[Turkmenistan]], 62&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Koneurgench]]. Its name means the "''castle carved out by demons''". It is located on a 30 or 40&amp;nbsp;km-long peninsula of the [[Ustyurt Plateau]] that is part of the [[Karakum Desert]], surrounded by a vast and bleak wilderness. It cannot be reached from the main road and the area itself requires an escort from soldiers at a local checkpoint. Dev-Kesken, specifically, is the remains of a citadel (a fortified town) within the larger site of the ruined city of Vazir. Little is known about Vazir's early history, but the ruins collectively date back to the 4th to 3rd centuries BCE.

== Site description ==
Dev-Kesken is part of the larger archaeological complex of Vazir which is best described as having an upper town and a lower town. To the South-West corner of upper town are the ruins of a large, rectangular citadel. Roughly 100 meters in size, Dev-Kesken is an unfired mud brick castle that looks almost as if it is part of its surrounding landscape. The walls of the citadel have regularly spaced rectangular towers with two square towers at the corners. Topping these walls are also fluted pilasters, or fluted rectangular columns that are ejecting from the wall. Between the walls were, at one time, two galleries - a lower and an upper with loopholes for archers along the wall and in the towers. Sometime later the loopholes along the upper gallery were filled and new outer walls were added. New semicircular towers were also added to the citadel at a later point in time. Dev-Kesken fell into decay roughly at the beginning of 4th century A.D.

== History of Dev-Kesken ==
First settled between 4th or 3rd century BCE, little is known about the history of Dev-Kesken. It was eventually abandoned, supposedly after it entered a time of environmental and social change. The already arid desert climate worsened as the levels of nearby rivers lowered and even the [[Aral Sea]] had contracted into a series of pools. Later in time, people of the nearby city Gurganji supposedly dammed what may have been a crucial river to the city of Visar. This may have also affected the climate of the region. Evidence from the local archaeological record suggests that other nearby rivers flowing into the Sarykamysh Lake may have begun to dry out at sometime around the 4th century while urban centers of nearby cities declined. Further excavation and study is needed to better understand why Dev-Kesken declined into ruin.

'''Elimar Klebs''' (15 October 1852 &amp;ndash; 16 May 1918) was a [[Germany|German]] [[historian]] of [[ancient history]]. He was the brother of [[botanist]] [[Georg Klebs]].

== Biography ==
Klebs was born in [[Braniewo|Braunsberg (Braniewo)]], [[Province of Prussia|Prussia]]. He studied in [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] under [[Theodor Mommsen]] and [[Heinrich von Treitschke]], receiving his doctorate in 1876 and his [[habilitation]] in 1883.&lt;ref name=HE&gt;[http://lagis-hessen.de/de/subjects/rsrec/sn/bio/register/person/entry/klebs%252C%2Belimar Hessische Biografie] biographical sketch&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he served as a [[privatdozent]] in Berlin.

Along with [[Hermann Dessau]] and [[Paul von Rohden]], he was involved in producing the first edition of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]]' ''[[Prosopographia Imperii Romani]]''. Klebs prepared the first volume, letters A-C, which appeared in 1897.&lt;ref name=WS&gt;[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Elimar_Klebs  Elimar Klebs] at de.WikiSource&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1906, he was a professor for ancient history at the [[University of Marburg]]. Because of a serious illness, he was put on leave in 1913 and discharged from his academic duties the following year. He died in Marburg.&lt;ref name=HE/&gt;

== Published works ==
Klebs focused on [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] history, such as the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', the ''[[Historia Apollonii]]'' and also studies involving the [[courtier]] [[Petronius]]. In addition, he made significant contributions to the ''[[Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft]]''. The following are some of his principal literary efforts:
* "Prosopographia Imperii Romani" saec. I. II. III. Band 1 A–C, Reimer, Berlin 1897. 
* "Die Erzählung von Apollonius aus Tyrus. Eine geschichtliche Untersuchung über ihre lateinische Urform und ihre späteren Bearbeitungen". Berlin 1899.

[[File:1990 Marosvasarhely.jpg|thumb|Târgu Mureș during the ethnic clashes (20 March 1990)]]

The '''ethnic clashes of [[Târgu Mureș]]''' (also called ''Black March'')&lt;ref&gt;Ildikó Lipcsey, Sabin Gherman, Adrian Severin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AkppAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Romania+and+Transylvania+in+the+20th+Century&amp;dq=Romania+and+Transylvania+in+the+20th+Century&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aLq5UfmkLMHHPJr6gfgI&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA Romania and Transylvania in the 20th Century], Corvinus Pub., 2006, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; refer to violent incidents between the [[Romanians|Romanian]] and [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] ethnic groups in [[Transylvania]], [[Romania]] in the early 1990s. The clashes were the bloodiest inter-ethnic incidents of the [[History of Romania since 1989|post-communist era]] in Transylvania.&lt;ref name='Dutceac'/&gt; Târgu Mureș ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Marosvásárhely'') is a Romanian town, with an ethnically mixed population that was almost equally distributed between Romanians and Hungarians after the [[Romanian Revolution|fall]] of the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] in December 1989. It has been an important cultural and political center for the Hungarian minority in Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Guntram Henrik Herb,David H. Kaplan (editors): ''Nested Identities: Nationalism, Territory, and Scale'', Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, 1999 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ikVCJQIJsNoC&amp;pg=PA279&amp;dq=%22Marosvasarhely+has+remained+an+important+cultural+and+political+center+for+Hungarians+in+Transylvania%22&amp;hl=hu&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a7HNUceWJrDS4QTI44CwCA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Marosvasarhely%20has%20remained%20an%20important%20cultural%20and%20political%20center%20for%20Hungarians%20in%20Transylvania%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1990, brief but violent clashes occurred there between the two ethnic groups in the town, involving ethnic Romanians from neighboring villages. The clashes left 6 people dead and 300 injured.&lt;ref name='Dutceac'/&gt; The riots were broadcast nationally on [[Televiziunea Română|Romanian television]] and were covered by media around the world.

The exact cause is still widely disputed. The roles of the media and the Romanian government are also questioned.

==The events==
{{One source|section|date=June 2013}}
[[File:Demonstration for Hungarian education, Targu Mures, 1990.jpg|thumb|200px|Demonstration for Hungarian education]]
[[File:Fekete marcius 1.jpg|thumb|200px|Romanian troops on the streets of Târgu Mureș]]
[[File:Fekete marcius 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Destroyed buses]]
At the beginning of March 1990, two episodes involving Romanian statues occurred. Graffiti was found on the statue of the Romanian historical figure [[Avram Iancu]], and a statue of another Romanian personality in a neighboring town was stolen. A Romanian newspaper referred to events of the same kind that took place before the 1940 Romanian-Hungarian conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ethnic Struggle, Coexistence, and Democratization in Eastern Europe |last= Stroschein|first=Sherrill |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2012|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= London|isbn=1-107-00524-8 |page=104 |pages= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the celebrations of the Hungarian community on the national day of the Hungarians ([[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|15th of March]]), accusations of [[nationalism]] and [[separatism]] began to be heard from Romanians.&lt;ref name='Dutceac'&gt;Anamaria Dutceac Segesten, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BNCWS_r8QpwC&amp;pg=PT32&amp;dq=%22backdrop+of+celebrations%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OGO4Ud_4FofhOralgEA&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAg Myth, Identity, and Conflict: A Comparative Analysis of Romanian and Serbian Textbooks ], Lexington Books,  2011, {{ISBN|9780739148679}}&lt;/ref&gt;


The next day, groups of heavily-intoxicated Romanians began to attack state-owned stores in which ethnic Hungarians had changed the signage to include Hungarian.&lt;ref name='Dutceac'/&gt; Students sang anti-Hungarian songs and pillaged a Hungarian Protestant church.&lt;ref name='Dutceac'/&gt;

On 20 March, Romanian villagers, dispatched by coach and train, arrived to the city and violently attacked the headquarters of  the [[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania]].&lt;ref name='Dutceac'/&gt; The local Hungarians tried to defend it, and the area fell into violence.&lt;ref name='Dutceac'/&gt; The involvement of the Romanian government in connection with the stimulation of ethnic violence is not completely unfounded (Andreescu 2001, Gallagher, 2005).&lt;ref name='Dutceac'/&gt;

The media enlarged the tensions and contributed, by inflammatory discourse, to the worsening of the situation.&lt;ref name='Dutceac'/&gt; The parliamentary report on the events confirmed that the media reported falsely about the heavy influx of Hungarians to help their co-nationals in their fight for a separate Transylvania.&lt;ref name='Dutceac'/&gt; Incitements about "separatist" trends were used in an effort to manufacture ethnic conflict.&lt;ref name='Dutceac'/&gt;

===Media issues===
The events are viewed differently by the sides that were involved. The 16 March incident at "Pharmacy no. 28" is an example of the capacity of the media to present the same event with opposite connotations. A news brief was presented, by both the Romanian and the Hungarian press, both using it to draw attention to the danger represented by the actions of "the others". Romanian media announced that the pharmacist wiped inscriptions in Romanian, and the Hungarian press wrote that the Romanians wiped the Hungarian inscription.&lt;ref&gt;(Romanian) http://adevarul.ro/locale/targu-mures/targu-mures-conflictul-martie-90-fost-fortat-presa-1_50bd3ed47c42d5a663c8fcef/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Romanian media====
{{incoherent|date=June 2013}}
According to the correspondent of the Romanian television, in the neighbouring town of [[Sovata]], a statue of [[Nicolae Bălcescu]] was knocked down, generating vehement protests of [[Vatra Românească]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napocanews.ro/2010/03/corespondentul-tvr-dorin-suciu-despre-revolutie-si-incidentele-din-martie-1990-de-la-tg-mures.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629094515/http://www.napocanews.ro/2010/03/corespondentul-tvr-dorin-suciu-despre-revolutie-si-incidentele-din-martie-1990-de-la-tg-mures.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 June 2013|title=Corespondentul TVR Dorin Suciu, despre Revoluţie şi incidentele din martie 1990 de la Tg. Mureş|publisher=|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several teams of cameramen from the Romanian army filmed numerous episodes of an explicitly anti-Romanian turn. There were shown groups of Hungarians who chanted "[[Horthy]], Horthy!", "Death to Romanians!" and "Transylvania to Hungary!" A 2010 article from [[Jurnalul Național]] talks about the influx of 10,000 Hungarian "tourists" who were officially coming to commemorate the Revolution of 1848. There are accounts in the same period of the desecration of the statues of [[Avram Iancu]], [[Nicolae Bălcescu]] and some arson attempts on Romanian houses in [[Sovata]]. Such acts have generated counter-manifestations by the Romanian population.&lt;ref name='Jurnalul'&gt;(Romanian) http://jurnalul.ro/special-jurnalul/escaladarea-conflictelor-din-targu-mures-farmacia-si-trabantul-538671.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the "road signs war" started and would continue for years throughout Transylvania. One of the ''Târgu Mureș'' signs at the entry into the city was replaced with a ''Marosvasarhely'' Hungarian sign. The change sparked anger from [[Azomureş]] Romanian employees, who restored the Romanian sign.&lt;ref name='Jurnalul'/&gt;

====Hungarian media====
{{expand section|date=June 2013}}

===1990 Human Rights Watch report===
&lt;blockquote&gt;In March, violence broke out between ethnic Hungarians and Romanians in the Transylvanian city of Târgu Mureș. On March 19, the headquarters of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR) was attacked by a large group of ethnic Romanians. The police and army did not respond to the UDMR's calls for protection until several hours after the attack began. Many ethnic Hungarians trapped inside were seriously injured.&lt;p&gt;

On the following morning, some 15,000 ethnic Hungarians gathered in the town square to protest the previous day's events. A group of approximately 3,000 ethnic Romanians hostile to the Hungarians' demands for autonomy began to gather on one side of the square in the early afternoon. Tensions escalated as word spread that buses of ethnic Romanian peasants from neighboring villages were heading toward town to support the Romanians in the square. By 2:30 p.m., the Chief of Police gave assurances to ethnic Romanian and Hungarian leaders in the square that the police had blocked off entrances to the city. However, unconfirmed reports indicated that the police allowed buses of ethnic Romanians through the roadblocks. Romanian peasants from villages outside Târgu Mureş arrived in the town center long after the roads should have been closed, and joined the Romanians already in the square.&lt;p&gt;

Around 5:00 p.m., violence erupted between ethnic Romanians and ethnic Hungarians, breaking the single line of 50 police that the authorities had sent to divide the two groups. Although the police and army had been made aware of the potential for violence by both Hungarian and Romanian leaders, who had made numerous reports of the escalating tensions in the square, the authorities once again failed to respond in an adequate manner to protect the citizens of Târgu Mureș.&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;Human Rights Watch World Report for the year 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the US State Department Human Rights Report for 1993:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania|UDMR]] condemned the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice|Supreme Court]]'s June 7 rejection of an appeal in the case of Pal Cseresznyés, an ethnic Hungarian serving a 10-year sentence for attempted murder as a result of his involvement in the Târgu Mureș incidents of March 1990. Cseresznyés participated in the savage beating of an ethnic Romanian, which an international journalist captured on film. The UDMR's complaint centered on the length of his sentence and on the fact that he was the only one of those filmed who was brought to trial. The court maintained that, regardless of the fates of the others involved, Cseresznyes had received a fair trial and was guilty as charged. Thus it found no legal reason to grant an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Report, January 31, 1994, US State Department.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Casualties and legal consequences==
There were 5 dead (three ethnic Hungarians and two ethnic Romanians) and 278 injured.
During the penal investigation and the court trials that followed, two ethnic Hungarians (Pál Cseresznyés and Ernő Barabás) and seven others were convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SK7Yy6KAUCYC&amp;pg=PA665&amp;dq=Cseresznyes+Pal+et+de+Barabas+Ern%C3%B6&amp;hl=ro&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oWWvUfPPH4GH4AT0-ICIAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Cseresznyes%20Pal%20et%20de%20Barabas%20Ern%C3%B6|title=Les relations roumano-hongroises dans la perspective de la construction ...|publisher=|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emblematic victims===
[[File:Andras Suto.JPG|thumbnail|Hungarian writer András Sütő]]
There were victims on both sides, two of which received particular attention:
* On 19 March 1990, the Hungarian writer [[András Sütő]] was seriously beaten when Romanians attacked the offices of the [[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania|Democratic Union of Hungarians]] (UDMR). With several bones broken and being blinded in one eye, he was carried to the Bucharest Military Hospital, then, later, by a military aircraft to [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], where his life was saved, but he retained a permanent eye injury. The attackers were never officially identified, or convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/04/AR2006100402032.html|title=Ethnic Hungarian Writer and Activist Andras Suto, 79|publisher=|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 20 March 1990, Mihăilă Cofariu, a Romanian from [[Ibănești, Mureș|Ibănești]] village was severely beaten even after he fell unconscious. Following that he remained neurologically disabled. The event was presented in international media as a Hungarian being beaten by Romanians. He was brought in coma to the county's emergency hospital and spent several months in hospitals in Romania and Germany. One of the perpetrators, ethnic Hungarian Pál Cseresznyés, was tried, convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison, but he was released in 1996 by Romanian President [[Emil Constantinescu]], as an act of reconciliation. The other convicted perpetrator, Ernő Barabás, emigrated to Hungary. He has also received a 10-year imprisonment sentence, but the Hungarian authorities denied all requests for extradition from the Romanian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/a93382/procurorii-unguri-nu-vor-sa-l-dea-pe-agresorul-lui-cofariu.html|title=Romania libera - stiri iesite din tipar - actualitate, investigatii, politica, cultura, diaspora, video, anunturi de mica publicitate|work=RomaniaLibera.ro|accessdate=10 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211005138/http://www.romanialibera.ro/a93382/procurorii-unguri-nu-vor-sa-l-dea-pe-agresorul-lui-cofariu.html|archive-date=11 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispute over causes==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
The prevalent opinion in the Romanian public is that the incidents were triggered by direct attacks by Hungarians against Romanian institutions, symbols, statues and policemen. They{{Who|date=February 2010}} claim that the riots were part of a plan to separate part of [[Transylvania]] from Romania to reintegrate it with [[Hungary]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Most Hungarians maintain, however, that rumours about Hungarian violence against Romanians and/or state institutions were unjustified or widely exaggerated. Hungarians also state that rumours about Hungarian violence were spread to undermine legitimate Hungarian demands (such as language, cultural rights or possible ethnic-based regional autonomy).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Involvement of Romanian government==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
[[File:Ion Iliescu (2004).jpg|thumbnail|Ion Iliescu, President of Romania at the time of the incident]]
The nature of the involvement of the Romanian government is also disputed. The official account is that the government quickly succeeded in calming the situation and ended the clashes. However, that has been disputed:
* Many Hungarians claim that the government was slow to act and failed to stem the violence at the beginning and thus responsible for its escalation. They support their arguments with filmed scenes in which police or other representatives of the authorities overlook events. They also criticise the fact that the vast majority of those taken under custody after the events were ethnic Hungarians, which suggests an ethnic bias.
* Many ethnic Romanians claim that the government did not intervene fast enough to protect the population and that clearly-identified Hungarians involved in the violence were not persecuted.
According to a 1990 report by [[Human Rights Watch]], "the authorities... failed to respond in an adequate manner to protect the citizens of Târgu Mureș".&lt;ref name="nine"/&gt; In this sense, the riots can be seen as a symptom of the fact that police, and the law enforcement agencies in general were very weak and morally compromised at the time because of how the communist regime had fallen. That opinion is reinforced by the similar pattern in some subsequent events (Piaţa Universităţii and the [[Mineriad|miners' invasion]] of [[Bucharest]]).

==Involvement of Western media==
The quality of the Western media's coverage of the riots is contested by many Romanians. An often-cited example is the gruesome footage of Mihăilă Cofariu, who was presented as a Hungarian being beaten by Romanians in the documentary ''And the walls came tumbling down: Bad Neighbours'', directed by Peter Swain and produced by ethnic Hungarian Paul Neuberg.&lt;ref name="adevarul"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/eveniment/Operatiunea_-Cofariu_0_224977912.html|title=Culisele manipulării conflictului româno-maghiar din 20 martie 1990|date=2010-03-14|accessdate=2010-03-15|publisher=Adevărul|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to its director, the filming crew arrived in Transylvania after the events, and most footage, including that of Mihăilă Cofariu, were provided by the Hungarian producer team, who let them believe that Cofariu was really a Hungarian being beaten by Romanians.&lt;ref name="adevarul"/&gt;

Also, during filming, the crew had no contact at all with any ethnic Romanian, and all documentation was gathered only from Hungarian sources, including some Hungarian contacts from the political scene.&lt;ref name="adevarul"/&gt;

Western media, picking up the story from the documentary, presented the Mihăilă Cofariu footage in the same way: as a Hungarian being beaten by Romanians. That falsehood is often used in Romanian media to link various similar cases of [[anti-Romanian]] falsehoods in Hungarian and Western media.&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;Artificial tensions from Budapest, article in Ziua, 2006 (reference below).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4824">'''Mohamed Fathi Osman''' (March 17, 1928 &amp;ndash; September 11, 2010) was an [[Egypt]]ian author and scholar who advocated on behalf of cooperation between Islam and other religions and whose writings include an overview of the [[Koran]] for the general public.

==Biography==

Osman was born on March 17, 1928, in [[Minya, Egypt]]. He joined the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in the 1940s and worked on its weekly journal. Osman was awarded an undergraduate degree in 1948 from [[Cairo University]] where he majored in history in 1948. He broke with [[Sayyid Qutb]] and the Muslim Brotherhood during the 1950s and wrote the 1960 book ''Islamic Thought and Change'', which presented a more progressive view of the religion, earned a law degree in 1960 from [[Alexandria University]] in 1960 and returned to Cairo University where he received a master's degree in Islamic-Byzantine relations in 1962. He was on the faculty of [[Al-Azhar University]] during the 1960s, where he worked on restructuring the teaching of Islam at universities and colleges in Egypt. He was granted a doctorate in [[Near Eastern studies]] in 1976 from [[Princeton University]], where he wrote a dissertation on the subject of Islamic land ownership and taxation and later taught history at [[Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University]] in [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Grimes, William. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/20/us/20osman.html "Fathi Osman, Scholar of Islam, Dies at 82"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 19, 2010. Accessed September 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Osman's writings, including 40 books written in English and Arabic, were aimed at making Islamic civilization and culture more understandable to non-Muslims and at showing followers of Islam that the religion provided the flexibility to adapt to modern times. ''[[The New York Times]]'' cited Osman's "monumental" 1997 book ''Concepts of the Quran: A Topical Reading'' as "his most important work in English", in which he explicated concepts in Islam for non-Muslims.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the book "a milestone in Islamic scholarship that has made the central text of the Muslim religion more accessible to English speakers".&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt; Other works written by Osman covered subjects such as [[Sharia]] and civil law, the rights of women, [[religious pluralism]] and the applicability of Western ideas by Muslims, topics he covered in Arabic in the 1963 text ''The Individual in Muslim Society: Mutual Rights and Obligations'' and ''Human Rights in Western Thought and Islamic Law'' in 1981. English language publications include the 1990 publication ''Muslim Women in the Family and the Society'' and the 1995 releases ''Islamic Law in the Contemporary Society: Shari'a Dynamics of Change'' and ''Children of Adam: An Islamic Perspective on Pluralism''.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

He moved to [[Los Angeles]] in 1987, where he was chosen as a scholar in residence at the Islamic Center of Southern California. There he helped establish the Institute for the Study of Islam in the Contemporary World and served as a senior scholar at the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; Dafer M. Dakhil of the Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement called Osman someone who believed that "Islam is a dynamic and flexible religion able to engage modernity and the issues of human rights and women's issues".&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;

Osman died at age 82 on September 11, 2010, at his home in [[Montrose, California]] due to [[congestive heart failure]].&lt;ref name=LATObit&gt;Woo, Elaine.

'''Female education in STEM''' includes child and adult [[female]] represented in the fields of [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM ). In 2017, 33% of students in STEM fields were women.

The organization [[UNESCO]] has stated that this gender disparity is due to [[discrimination]], [[Bias|biases]], [[Norm (social)|social norms]] and expectations that influence the quality of [[education]] women receive and the subjects they study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; UNESCO also believes that having more women in STEM fields is desirable because it would help bring about [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002534/253479e.pdf|title=Cracking the code: Girls' and womens' education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100233-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender differences in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] education participation are already visible in [[Early childhood education|early childhood care and education]] in science- and math-related play, and become more pronounced at higher levels of [[education]]. Girls appear to lose interest in STEM subjects with age, particularly between early and late adolescence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This decreased interest affects participation in advanced studies at the secondary level and in [[higher education]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Female students represent 35% of all students enrolled in STEM-related fields of study at this level globally &lt;!-- Needs clear source --&gt;. Differences are also observed by disciplines, with female enrollment lowest in engineering, manufacturing and construction, natural science, mathematics and statistics and ICT{{fix|text=what?}} fields. Significant regional and country differences in female representation in STEM studies can be observed, though, suggesting the presence of contextual factors affecting girls’ and women’s engagement in these fields. Women leave STEM disciplines in disproportionate numbers during their higher education studies, in their transition to the world of work and even in their career cycle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/priority-areas/gender-and-science/improving-%20measurement-of-gender-equality-in-stem/stem-and-gender-advancement-saga/|title=STEM and Gender Advancement (SAGA) {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PISA 2015 Results (Volume I): Excellence and Equity in Education|last=|first=|publisher=OECD|year=2016|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/international-results/advanced/|title=TIMSS ADVANCED 2015 INTERNATIONAL RESULTS REPORT – TIMSS 2015 INTERNATIONAL RESULTS REPORT|website=timssandpirls.bc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/|title=UIS Statistics|last=UIS|website=data.uis.unesco.org|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Engineering Indicators 2014|last=|first=|publisher=National Science Board|year=2014|isbn=|location=Arlington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Learning achievement in STEM education ===
Data on gender differences in learning achievement present a complex picture, depending on what is measured (subject, knowledge acquisition against knowledge application), the level of education/age of students, and geographic location. Overall, women's participation has been increasing, but significant regional variations exist. For example, where data are available in [[Africa]], [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], the gender gap is largely in favour of boys in mathematics achievement in secondary education. In contrast, in the Arab States, girls perform better than boys in both subjects in primary and secondary education. As with the data on participation, national and regional variations in data on learning achievement suggest the presence of contextual factors affecting girls’ and women’s engagement in these fields. Girls’ achievement seems to be stronger in science than mathematics and where girls do better than boys, the score differential is up to three times higher than where boys do better.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} girls tend to outperform boys in certain sub-topics such as [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] but do less well in [[physics]] and [[earth science]].

The gender gap has fallen significantly in science in secondary education among [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study|TIMSS trend countries]]: 14 out of 17 participating countries had no gender gap in science in 2015, compared to only one in 1995. However, the data is less well known outside of these 17 countries. The gender gap in boys' favour is slightly bigger in mathematics but improvements over time in girls’ favour are also observed in certain countries, despite the important regional variations. Gender differences are observed within mathematic sub-topics with girls outperforming boys in topics such as [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] but doing less well in "number". Girls’ performance is stronger in assessments that measure knowledge acquisition than those measuring knowledge application. Country coverage in terms of data availability is quite limited while data is collected at different frequency and against different variables in the existing studies. There are large gaps in our knowledge of the situation in low- and middle-income countries in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], Central [[Asia]], and South and West Asia, particularly at secondary level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Trends in Mathematics and Science Achievement, Curriculum and Instruction|last=Mullis, I.

== Factors influencing girls' and women's participation and achievement in STEM education ==
[[File:Expectations of a ICT career, by gender (PISA 2015).svg|thumb|upright=2|According to [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA]] 2015 results 4.8% of boys and 0.4% of girls expect a ICT career&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Catherine André/VoxEurop/EDJNet |author2=Marzia Bona/OBC Transeuropa/EDJNet |title=The ICT sector is booming.

According to UNESCO, there are multiple and overlapping factors which influence girls' and women's participation, achievement and progression in STEM studies and careers, all of which interact in complex ways, including: 
* '''Individual level:''' biological factors that may influence individuals’ abilities, skills, and [[Behavior|behaviour]] such as brain structure and function, [[Hormone|hormones]], [[genetics]], and cognitive traits like spatial and linguistic skills. It also considers psychological factors, including self-efficacy, interest and motivation.
* '''Family and peer level:''' parental beliefs and expectations, parental [[education]] and socioeconomic status, and other household factors, as well as peer influences.
* '''School level:''' factors within the [[learning environment]], including teachers’ profile, experience, beliefs and expectations, [[Curriculum|curricula]], learning materials and resources, [[Teaching method|teaching strategies]] and student teacher interactions, assessment practices and the overall school environment.
* '''Societal level:''' social and cultural [[norm (social)|norm]]s related to [[gender equality]], and gender stereotypes in the media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Individual level ===
{{see also|Sex differences in psychology|Sex differences in intelligence}}
The question of whether there are differences in cognitive ability between men and women has long been a topic of debate among researchers and scholars. Some studies have found no differences in the neural mechanism of learning based on sex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spearman, J. and Watt, H.|first=|date=2013|title=Perception shapes experience: The influence of actual and perceived classroom environment dimensions on girls’  motivations for science|url=|journal=Learning Environment Research|volume=16|pages=217-238|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolmos, A., Mejlgaard, N., Haase, S. and Holgaard, J.E.|first=|date=2013|title=Motivational factors, gender and engineering in education|url=|journal=European Journal of Engineering Education|volume=38|pages=340-358|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDaniel, A.|first=|date=2015|title=The role of cultural contexts in explaining cross-national gender gaps in STEM Expectations|url=|journal=European Sociological Review|volume=32|pages=122-133|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Su, R., Rounds, J. and Armstrong, P.I.|first=|date=2009|title=Men and things, women and people: A meta-analysis of sex differences in interests|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=135|pages=859|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss of interest has been the major reason cited for girls opting out of STEM. However, some have stated that this choice is influenced heavily by the socialization process and stereotyped ideas about gender roles, including stereotypes about gender and STEM. Gender stereotypes that communicate the idea that STEM studies and careers are male domains can negatively affect girls’ interest, engagement and achievement in STEM and discourage them from pursuing STEM careers. Girls who assimilate such stereotypes have lower levels of self-efficacy and confidence in their ability than boys. Self-efficacy affects both STEM education outcomes and aspirations for STEM careers to a considerable extent. Some studies have shown that girls appear to lose interest in STEM subjects with age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Family and peer level ===
Parents, including their beliefs and expectations, play an important role in shaping girls’ attitudes towards, and interest in, STEM studies. Parents with traditional beliefs about gender roles and who treat girls and boys unequally can reinforce stereotypes about gender and ability in STEM. Parents can also have a strong influence on girls' STEM participation and learning achievement through the family values, environment, experiences and encouragement that they provide. Some research finds that parents’ expectations, particularly the mother’s expectations, have more influence on the [[higher education]] and career choices of girls than those of boys&lt;!-- Needs source if referring to "some research" --&gt;. Higher socio-economic status and parental educational qualifications are associated with higher scores in [[mathematics]] and science for both girls and boys. Girls’ science performance appears to be more strongly associated with mothers’ higher educational qualifications, and boys’ with their fathers’. Family members with STEM careers can also influence girls’ STEM engagement. The broader socio-cultural context of the family can also play a role. Factors such as ethnicity, the language used at home, immigrant status and family structure may also have an influence on girls’ participation and performance in STEM. Peers can also impact on girls’ motivation and feeling of belonging in STEM education. Influence of female peers is a significant predictor of girls’ interest and confidence in mathematics and science.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== School level ===
Qualified teachers with specialization in STEM can positively influence girls’ performance and engagement with STEM education and their interest in pursuing STEM careers. Female STEM teachers often have stronger benefits for girls, possibly by acting as role models and by helping to dispel stereotypes about sex-based STEM ability. Teachers’ beliefs, attitudes, behaviours and interactions with students, as well as [[Curriculum|Curricula]] and learning materials, can all play a role as well. Opportunities for real-life experiences with STEM, including hands-on practice, apprenticeships, career counselling and mentoring can expand girls’ understanding of STEM studies and professions and maintain interest. Assessment processes and tools that are gender-biased or include gender [[stereotype]]s may negatively affect girls’ performance in STEM. Girls’ learning outcomes in STEM can also be compromised by psychological factors such as mathematics or test anxiety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A 2018 study found that while girls perform better or equal to boys in two out of three countries, in nearly all countries more girls were qualified to college-level{{Clarify|reason=is university level STEM study meant? Native English speaker help needed.|date=March 2018}} study than had enrolled. Researchers found that female enrolment to STEM subjects was relatively lower in countries with a high degree of gender equality – a [[gender-equality paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719|title=The Gender-Equality Paradox in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education|last=G. Stoet, D. C. Geary|first=|date=14 February 2018|website=SAGE Publishing|access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180214150132.htm|title=Countries with greater gender equality have a lower percentage of female STEM graduates: Findings could help refine education efforts and policies geared toward girls and science, technology, engineering and mathematics|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Societal level ===
Cultural and [[Norm (social)|social norms]] influence girls’ perceptions about their abilities, role in society and career and life aspirations.The degree of gender equality in wider society influences girls’ participation and performance in STEM. In countries with greater gender equality, girls tend to have more positive attitudes and confidence about mathematics and the gender gap in achievement in the subject is smaller. Targeted measures to promote gender equality, such as gender mainstreaming legislation or policies such as quotas, financial incentives or other, can increase girls’ and women’s participation in STEM education and careers. Gender stereotypes portrayed in the media are internalized by children and [[Adult|adults]] and affect the way they see themselves and others. Media can perpetuate or challenge [[gender stereotypes]] about STEM abilities and careers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4224">The '''Geneva International Discussions''' ('''GID''') are international talks, launched in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], in October 2008, to address the consequences of the 2008 [[Russo–Georgian War|conflict in Georgia]]. Co-chaired by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), the [[European Union]] (EU), and the [[United Nations]] (UN), the Geneva process brings together representatives of the participants of the conflict—[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Russia]], and Georgia's breakaway [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]]—as well as the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=civ1&gt;{{cite news|title=At Geneva Talks Russia Says Georgia’s NATO Integration Poses Security Threat to Region|url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=28403|accessdate=8 July 2015|work=Civil Georgia|date=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OSCE1&gt;{{cite web|title=Press releases related to the Geneva International Discussions|url=http://www.osce.org/home/104211|publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the cessation of the UN and OSCE missions in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, respectively, following the August 2008 Russo–Georgian war, the GID remain the only platform for all interested sides to discuss security-related issues and humanitarian needs of the conflict-affected population.&lt;ref name=civ1/&gt;&lt;ref name=OSCE1/&gt;

The commitment of non-use of force is one of the principal issues at point discussed at several GID rounds. Georgia had made a unilateral pledge of non-use of force on 23 November 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Georgia Makes 'Unilateral Pledge' of Non-Use of Force|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=22880|accessdate=8 July 2015|work=Civil Georgia|date=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since insisted Russia should do the same. The Russian government refuses to follow the suit, alleging it is not a party to the conflict. Instead, it wants Georgia to sign treaties envisaging non-use of force directly with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which Georgia refuses on account of the entities being part of its sovereign state.&lt;ref name=civ1/&gt; Russia has also expressed its concerns over the [[Georgia–NATO relations|Georgians relations]] with [[NATO]] and military cooperation with the United States.&lt;ref name=civ1/&gt;

Another major source of disagreement is the issue of return of [[internally displaced persons]] (IDPs) and refugees, mostly ethnic Georgians, which the Abkhaz and South Ossetian representatives, with Russian backing, reject to discuss as long as Georgia is able to secure the yearly resolutions on IDPs at the [[UN General Assembly]]. Among topics touched upon the talks are those related to language of instruction in schools in predominantly ethnic Georgian areas of Abkhazia (such as the [[Gali District, Abkhazia|Gali district]]) as well as freedom of movement and mobility, missing persons, environmental and cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=civ1/&gt;

In the summer of 2016, the Abkhaz Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Kan Taniya, said in an interview with the German newspaper [[junge Welt]] that the discussions in the Geneva International Discussions are locked in a standstill.&lt;ref&gt;David X.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42982">'''History of swimwear''' traces the changes in the styles of men's and women's [[swimwear]] over time and between cultures, and touches on the social, religious and legal attitudes to swimming and swimwear.

In [[classical antiquity]] and in most cultures, swimming was either in the nude or the swimmer would merely strip to their underwear. In the [[Middle Ages]], swimming was strongly discouraged, and into the 18th century swimming was regarded as of doubtful morality, and had to be justified on health grounds. In the [[Victorian era]] swimwear was of a style of outer clothing of the time, which were cumbersome and even dangerous in the water, especially in the case of dress-style swimwear for women. Since the early 20th century, swimming came to be regarded as a legitimate leisure activity or pastime and clothing made specifically for swimming became the norm. Since then, swimwear has become increasingly more scanty and form-fitting, despite the objections of conservative elements in the community and moral campaigners, and the use of hi-tech materials has become more common.

==Classical ages==
In [[classical antiquity]] swimming and bathing were done [[Nudity|naked]]. There are Roman murals which show women playing sports and exercising wearing two-piece suits covering the areas around their breasts and hips in a fashion remarkably similar to the present-day bikini. However, there is no evidence that they were used for swimming. All classical pictures of swimming show nude swimmers.

In various cultural traditions one swims, if not in the nude, in a version in suitable material of a garment or undergarment commonly worn on land, e.g. a [[loincloth]] such as the Japanese man's [[fundoshi]].

==Middle Ages==
In the [[Middle Ages]], swimming and outdoor bathing were discouraged in the [[Christian West]] and there was little need for a bathing or swimming costume{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}.

==17th century==
Female bathing costumes were derived from those worn at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and other spas. It would appear that until the 1670s nude female bathing in the spas was the norm and that after that time women bathed clothed. Celia Fiennes gave a detailed description of the standard ladies' bathing costume in 1687:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Ladyes go into the bath with Garments made of a fine yellow canvas, which is stiff and made large with great sleeves like a parson’s gown; the water fills it up so that it is borne off that your shape is not seen, it does not cling close as other linning, which Lookes sadly in the poorer sort that go in their own linning. The Gentlemen have drawers and wastcoates of the same sort of canvas, this is the best linning, for the bath water will Change any other yellow.&lt;ref name="Bryde1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrde|first= Penelope|title=That Frightful Unbecoming Dress: Clothes for Spa Bathing at Bath|journal=Costume|volume=21|issue=1|date=1987|pp=48–49|doi=10.1080/cost.1987.0007|issn=0590-8876|url=https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.1080/cost.1987.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==18th century==
The [[bathing gown]] in the 18th century was a loose ankle-length full-sleeve [[chemise]]-type gown made of wool or flannel, so that modesty or decency was not threatened.&lt;ref name=claud&gt;Claudia B. Kidwell, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/37586/37586-h/37586-h.htm Women's Bathing and Swimming Costume in the United States]'', Smithsonian Institution Press, City of Washington, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom until the mid-19th century there was no law against nude swimming, and each town was free to make its own laws. For example, the [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] Corporation official bathing dress code of 1737 prescribed, for men:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is Ordered Established and Decreed by this Corporation that no Male person above the age of ten years shall at any time hereafter go into any Bath or Baths within this City by day or by night without a Pair of [[Undergarment|Drawers]] and a [[Waistcoat]] on their bodies.&lt;ref name="Bryde1987" /&gt;{{rp|50}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In rivers, lakes, streams and the sea men swam in the nude, where the practice was common. Those who did not swim in the nude, stripped to their underwear.

The Bath Corporation official bathing dress code of 1737 prescribed, for women:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No Female person shall at any time hereafter go into a Bath or Baths within this City by day or by night without a decent [[Chemise|Shift]] on their bodies.&lt;ref name="Bryde1987" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The Expedition of Humphry Clinker]]'' was published in 1771 and its description of ladies’ bathing costume is different from that of Celia Fiennes a hundred years earlier:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ladies wear jackets and petticoats of brown linen, with chip hats, in which they fix their handkerchiefs to wipe the sweat from their faces; but, truly, whether it is owing to the steam that surrounds them, or the heat of the water, or the nature of the dress, or to all these causes together, they look so flushed, and so frightful, that I always turn my eyes another way.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last=Smollett |first=Tobias George |date=1906 |title=The Expedition of Humphry Clinker |url= |location=New York |publisher=The Century Company |pages=38-39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==19th century==
[[File:Bathing suit MET 1979.346.18ab.jpeg|thumb|1870s American bathing suit for women, made of wool and covering arms and legs]]
[[File:BathingMachineDontBeAfraid.jpg|thumb|Man and woman in swimsuits, c. 1910; she is exiting a [[bathing machine]]]]
The English practice of men swimming in the nude was banned in the United Kingdom in 1860. Drawers, or [[caleçon]]s as they were called, came into use in the 1860s. Even then there were many who protested against them and wanted to remain in the nude. [[Francis Kilvert]] described men's bathing suits coming into use in the 1870s as "a pair of very short red and white striped drawers".&lt;ref name="Cinder1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cinder|first=Cec |title=The Nudist Idea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0upAAAACAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Ultraviolet Press|isbn=978-0-9652085-0-5|p=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 19th century the top became knee-length while an ankle-length drawer was added as a bottom. By the second half of the 19th century, in France, the sleeves started to vanish, the bottom became shorter to reach only the knees and the top became hip-length and both became more form fitting.&lt;ref name=claud/&gt;&lt;ref name="A Brief History Of Bathing Suits"&gt;Herbert Sanchez, [http://www.articlegarden.com/Article/A-Brief-History-Of-Bathing-Suits/23798 A Brief History Of Bathing Suits], Article Garden&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1900s women wore wool dresses on the beach that were made of up to {{convert|9|yd}} of fabric.&lt;ref name=sydelle&gt;{{cite web|last=Sydelle|first=John|title=The Swimsuit Industry|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/swimsuit-industry-18779.html|publisher=Chron|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penelope Byrde points out that Smollett's description may not be accurate, for he describes a two-piece costume, not the one piece shift or smock that most people describe and is depicted in contemporary prints. His description does, however, tally with Elizabeth Grant's description of the guide's costume at Ramsgate in 1811. The only difference is in the fabric the costumes are made of. Flannel, however, was a common fabric for sea bathing costumes as many believed the warmer fabric was necessary in cold water.&lt;ref name=Austen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jasa.net.au/seaside/Bathing.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514035307/http://www.jasa.net.au/seaside/Bathing.htm|title=Bathing - Jane Austen at the seaside|archivedate=14 May 2013|work=jasa.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, in the 19th century women wore a [[bathing gown]] in the water. These were loose ankle-length full-sleeve [[chemise]]-type gown made of wool or flannel, so that modesty or decency was not threatened.&lt;ref name="claud"/&gt; They were long dresses of fabrics that would not become transparent when wet, with weights sewn into the hems so that they would not rise up in the water. The men's swim suit, a rather form-fitting wool garment with long sleeves and legs similar to long [[underwear]], was developed and would change little for a century.

In the 19th century, the woman's double suit was common, comprising a gown from shoulder to knees plus a set of trousers with leggings going down to the ankles. In the first half of the 19th century the top became knee-length while an ankle-length drawer was added as a bottom. By the second half of the 19th century, in France, the sleeves started to vanish, the bottom became shorter to reach only the knees and the top became hip-length and both became more form fitting.&lt;ref name=claud/&gt;&lt;ref name="A Brief History Of Bathing Suits"/&gt; In the 1900s women wore wool dresses on the beach that were made of up to {{convert|9|yd}} of fabric.&lt;ref name=sydelle /&gt;

In the [[Victorian era]], Western cultures deplored nudity of any degree, and people took great pains to cover themselves, even bare chested male swimmers at ocean beaches.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Popular beach resorts were commonly equipped with [[bathing machine]]s designed to avoid the exposure of people in swimsuits, especially to people of the opposite sex.

In the United States, [[beauty pageant]]s of women in bathing costumes became popular from the 1880s. However, such events were not regarded as  respectable. Beauty contests became more respectable with the first modern "[[Miss America]]" contest held in 1921, though less respectable beauty contests continued to be held.

==Early 20th century==
{{double image|right|Annette Kellerman.jpg|130|Fanny Durack and Mina Wylie-1-.jpg|140|[[Annette Kellerman]]'a form-fitting one-piece [[Maillot|tank suit]] (1907) inspired the women's swimwear in the early [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] (1912).}}

In 1907, the swimmer [[Annette Kellerman]] from Australia visited the United States as an "underwater ballerina", a version of [[synchronised swimming]] involving diving into glass tanks. She was arrested on a [[Boston]] beach for [[indecent exposure]] because her swimsuit showed arms, legs and the neck, a costume she adopted from England,&lt;ref name=claud/&gt; and which was similar to men's swimsuits of the time. Kellerman changed the suit to have long arms and legs and a collar, still keeping the close fit that revealed the shapes underneath. Kellerman marketed a line of bathing suits and her style of one-piece suits came to be known as "the Annette Kellerman". The one-piece swimming tights became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Liz Conor, ''The spectacular modern woman: feminine visibility in the 1920s'', page 152, Indiana University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-253-34391-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' praised the Kellerman swimsuit, writing in June 1920 (vol. 55, no. 6, p.&amp;nbsp;138) "Annette Kellerman Bathing Attire is distinguished by an incomparable, daring beauty of fit that always remains refined." The following year, in June 1921 (vol. 54, no. 2504, p.&amp;nbsp;101) it wrote that these bathing suits were "famous&amp;nbsp;... for their perfect fit and exquisite, plastic beauty of line."&lt;ref name=claud/&gt;

==1910s==
{{double image|left|Old Time Swimming Photograph crop.jpg|210|Bathing-apparel-maillot-nyt-1916.png|124|[[Maillot|Maillot-style]] swimwear on the beach (1915) and on magazines (1916).}}

Despite opposition from some groups, the form-fitting style proved popular. It was not long before swimwear started to shrink further. At first arms were exposed and then legs up to mid-thigh. Necklines receded from around the neck down to around the top of the bosom. The development of new fabrics allowed for new varieties of more comfortable and practical swimwear.

Female swimming was introduced at the [[Swimming at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Summer Olympics]]. Competitors from 17 countries took part, with women from nine countries wearing swimsuits similar to Kellerman's swimsuit, which were similar to swimsuits worn by the male swimmers. In 1913, inspired by the breakthrough, the designer [[Carl Jantzen]] made the first functional two-piece swimwear, a close-fitting one-piece with shorts on the bottom and short sleeves on top.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/web/20060705-bikini-swimming-suit-louis-reard-micheline-bernardini-paris-brigitte-bardot.shtml|accessdate=13 November 2007|publisher=American Heritage Inc.|title=60 Years of Bikinis|author=Hoover, Elizabeth D.|date=5 July 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909195749/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/web/20060705-bikini-swimming-suit-louis-reard-micheline-bernardini-paris-brigitte-bardot.shtml |archivedate=9 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silent films such as ''[[The Water Nymph]]'' (1912) saw [[Mabel Normand]] in revealing attire, and this was followed by the daringly dressed ''[[Mack Sennett#Sennett Bathing Beauties|Sennett Bathing Beauties]]'' (1915–1929). The name "swim suit" was coined in 1915 by Jantzen Knitting Mills, a sweater manufacturer who launched a swimwear brand named the Red Diving Girl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.globalintimatewear.com/FashionStyle/6810/3/The_Beginning_History_of_Swimwear.html The Beginning History of Swimwear], Global Intimate Wear, 08-07-2012&lt;/ref&gt; The first annual bathing-suit day at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1916 was a landmark.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Preer, "[https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1990/spring/esquire-v-walker-1.html The Postmaster General and "The Magazine for Men]"''Prologue Magazine'', page 1, Spring 1990, Vol. 23, No. 1, U.S. National Archives and Records Administration&lt;/ref&gt; The swimsuit apron, a design for early swimwear, disappeared by 1918, leaving a tunic covering the shorts.&lt;ref name=carnival/&gt;

Public nudity was a major concern in designing early swimwear. It was a major factor behind the non-participation of American women in the 1912 Olympics.&lt;ref name=us&gt;Shelton, Sandi Kahn (4 August 2012) [http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20120804/women-swimmers-bucked-tide-of-sexism-to-compete-in-olympics-100-years-ago-scsu-librarians-book-says-competition-deemed-too-unfemale-video Women swimmers bucked tide of sexism to compete in Olympics 100 years ago; SCSU librarian's book says competition deemed 'too unfemale' (video)]. nhregister.com&lt;/ref&gt; At those Games, British women wore full-body silk suits of such a volume that they could be passed through a wedding ring. The suits were complemented by [[Brassiere|bras]] and [[bikini]]-style briefs as they became transparent when wet. Women's coaches were rare at early Olympics, and to further reduce the chances of harassment women were accompanied by [[Chaperone (social)|chaperones]].&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;Manning, Jo (11 August 2008) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7554196.stm First champ 'would be thrilled'].

==1920s==
[[Image:BathingSuit1920s.jpg|thumb|250px|American 1920s woman's bathing suit]]
During the 1920s and 1930s, people began to shift from "taking in the water" to "taking in the sun", at bathhouses and spas, and swimsuit designs shifted from functional considerations to incorporate more decorative features. [[Rayon]] was used in the 1920s in the manufacture of tight-fitting swimsuits,&lt;ref name=sydelle /&gt; but its durability, especially when wet, proved problematic,&lt;!-- Rayon also had the lowest elastic recovery of any fiber.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Kadolph"&gt;{{cite book|title=Textiles|edition=9|author1=Kadolph, Sara J.  |author2=Langford, Anna L.|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-025443-6|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] and [[silk]] also sometimes being used.&lt;ref name=glamoursurf&gt;{{cite web|title=Vintage Swimwear Timeline|url=http://www.glamoursurf.com/swimwear_timeline.html|publisher=Glamoursurf.com|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Longina Phillips Design"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vintage Swimwear |url=https://longinaphillipsdesigns.com/vintage-swimwear/|accessdate=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Burlesque]] and [[vaudeville]] performers wore two-piece outfits in the 1920s. The 1929 film ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]'' shows Russian women wearing early two-piece swimsuits which expose their midriff, and a few who are topless. Films of holidaymakers in Germany in the 1930s show women wearing two-piece suits,&lt;ref name=metm/&gt; In 1928, [[Speedo]] introduced their racerback silk suit that was optimized to fit the body shape.&lt;ref name=Speedo1&gt;[http://www.speedo.com.au/history Our History]. speedo.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daily News, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==1930s==
[[File:Jane Wyman,1935.jpg|thumb|[[Academy Award]] winner actress [[Jane Wyman]] lounging on a California beach, 1935]]
By the 1930s men began to go without shirts for swimming,&lt;ref name=Hess&gt;{{cite web|author=Meagan Hess |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma04/hess/fashion/inthiscorner3.html |title=Skirting the Skirts at the Bathing Beach |publisher=Xroads.virginia.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and barechestedness in male swimwear became the norm by the end of the 1940s, including in competitive swimming events, in which men are not only barechested, but wear a swimming suit that is intended merely to meet public decency requirements. The norm of male barechestedness in swimwear extended to other competitive sports, such as professional boxing and professional wrestling.

By the 1930s, necklines plunged at the back, sleeves disappeared and sides were cut away and tightened. With the development of new clothing materials, particularly [[latex]] and [[nylon]], through the 1930s&lt;!--1934 is too specific a date--&gt; swimsuits gradually began hugging the body, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning.&lt;ref name=carnival&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnaval.com/bikini/#In%20Brazil |title=History of the Bikini |publisher=Carnival}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood endorsed the new glamour with films such as ''[[Neptune's Daughter (1949 film)|Neptune's Daughter]]'' (1949) in which [[Esther Williams]] wore provocatively named costumes such as "Double Entendre" and "Honey Child".&lt;ref name=notting&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Sandhu |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/sunandsea/728059/Nottingham-Bathed-in-nostalgia.html |title=Nottingham: Bathed in nostalgia |publisher=The Telegraph |date=August 4, 2003 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams, who also was an [[Amateur Athletic Union]] champion in the 100 meter [[Freestyle swimming|freestyle]] (1939)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/adec_0001_0004_0/adec_0001_0004_0_01367.html THE 1930s: Sports: Overview], Novel Guide&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/e2node/Esther%2520Williams Esther Williams], Everything2&lt;/ref&gt; also portrayed Kellerman in the 1952 film ''[[Million Dollar Mermaid]]'' (titled as ''The One Piece Bathing Suit'' in UK).&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Anzovin]] &amp; Janet Podell, ''Famous First Facts'', page 51, H.W.

==1940s==
Wartime production during [[World War II]] required vast amounts of [[cotton]], [[silk]], [[nylon]], [[wool]], [[leather]], and [[rubber]]. In 1942, the United States  [[War Production Board]] issued Regulation L-85, cutting the use of natural fibers in clothing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World War II|url=http://amhistory.si.edu/militaryhistory/printable/section.asp?id=9&amp;sub=3|work=The Price of Freedom: Americans at War|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mandating a 10% reduction in the amount of fabric in women's beachwear.&lt;ref name=HistC&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=VideoArticle&amp;id=6949 Bikini Introduced] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419083213/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=VideoArticle&amp;id=6949 |date=2009-04-19 }}, This Day in History, ''[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]''&lt;/ref&gt; To comply with the regulations, swimsuit manufacturers produced two-piece suits with bare midriffs.&lt;ref name=fashionencyc&gt;{{cite web|title=Bikini|url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/Modern-World-1946-1960/Bikini.html|publisher=Fashion Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fabric shortage continued for some time after the end of the war.

Women's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of [[midriff exposure]]. Teen magazines of late 1940s and 1950s featured similar designs of midriff-baring suits and tops. However, midriff fashion was stated as only for beaches and informal events and considered indecent to be worn in public.&lt;ref name="girl"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Claudia Mitchell |author2=Jacqueline Reid-Walsh |title=Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide Volume 1 of Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn= 9780313339097|page=702|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arQy0v_PBx4C&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=cheerleader+midriff&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_wyAT--XCoTprQeL5NTrBQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=midriff&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the figure-hugging nature of these garments, [[glamour photography]] since the 1940s and 1950s has often featured people wearing swimsuits. This type of glamour photography eventually evolved into swimsuit photography exemplified by the annual ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]''. Beauty contests also required contestants to wear form-fitting swimsuits.

Two-piece swimsuits without the usual [[skirt panel]] and other superfluous material started appearing in the U.S. when the government ordered the 10% reduction in fabric used in woman's swimwear in 1943 as wartime rationing.&lt;ref name="HistC"/&gt; By that time, two-piece swimsuits were ubiquitous on American beaches. The July 9, 1945, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' shows women in [[Paris]] wearing similar items. [[Hollywood]] stars like [[Ava Gardner]], [[Rita Hayworth]] and [[Lana Turner]] tried similar swimwear or [[beachwear]].&lt;ref name=ArtCent&gt;James Kitchling, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20171017205003/http://www.articles-central.info/Art/22681/48/Short-History-of-Bikinis-and-Swimsuits.html Short History of Bikinis and Swimsuits]", Articles Central, 2008-08-02&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pin-up girl|Pin ups]] of Hayworth and [[Esther Williams]] in the costume were widely distributed.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt; The most provocative swimsuit was the 1946 Moonlight Buoy, a bottom and a top of material that weighed only eight ounces. What made the Moonlight Buoy distinctive was a large [[Cork (material)|cork]] [[buckle]] attached to the bottoms, which made it possible to tie the top to the cork buckle and splash around [[Naturism|''au naturel'']] while keeping both parts of the suit afloat. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine had a [[photo essay]] on the Moonlight Buoy and wrote, "The name of the suit, of course, suggests the nocturnal conditions under which nude swimming is most agreeable."&lt;ref name=WOJSI/&gt;

==1950s==
Swimwear of the 1940s, 50s and early 60s followed the [[Silhouette#Fashion and fitness|silhouette]] mostly from the early 1930s whereas after [[World War II]], a new wardrobe and style of vacation-swimwear arose, coupled with an increase of leisure time and bustling postwar resorts.&lt;ref name="Stevenson, N. J. 2012"&gt;Stevenson, N. J. (2012). Fashion: A visual history from regency &amp; Romance to retro &amp; revolution. New York: The Ivy Press Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1951, A huge celebration called "The Festival of Britain" was promoted of everything new and modern and cast a line into the future, building on a feeling of hope.&lt;ref name="Kennedy2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=Sarah |title=The Swimsuit: A History of Twentieth-century Fashions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=77AlPwAACAAJ|year=2010|publisher=Carlton Books|isbn=978-1-84732-382-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beachwear style were very popular in U.S and Europe,&lt;ref name="Stevenson, N. J. 2012"/&gt; but this fashion originated on the [[French Riviera]], which people was quoted this place as "A sunny place for shady people".&lt;ref name="Kennedy2010" /&gt; Keeping in line with the ultra-feminine look dominated by [[Christian Dior SA|Dior]] which brought out his one and only collection of swimwear for the Cole of California in 1955.&lt;ref name="Kennedy2010" /&gt; He designed a series of floral printed swimsuits with halter neckline style. It evolved into a dress followed his New Look silhouette with cinched waists and constructed bustlines, accessorized with earrings, bracelets, hats, scarves, sunglasses, hand bags and cover-ups.&lt;ref name=asseen&gt;Daniel Delis Hill, ''As Seen in Vogue'', page 63, Texas Tech University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-89672-616-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Women inspired by Hollywood’s film stars For example, Doris Day offering  a” girl-next-door’ look and the accession and coronation of the young Queen Elizabeth in February 1952 and June 1953 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Laver, J. (2012). Costume and fashion: A concise history. London: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Early 50s, despite the reaction to the [[2-pieces swimsuit]] worn by Brigitte Bardot in [[Manina, the Girl in the Bikini]] in 1952, most women in the 1950s still wore one-piece suits.&lt;ref name="Stevenson, N. J. 2012"/&gt; To increasing female emancipation and realized the commercial possibilities of beauty pageants, big companies launched beauty contests to find girls who could help promote products, believing that a picture of a pretty girl in a swimsuit was the best promotion. Instead of swimsuits, these contests popularized the [[Playsuit (ladies' clothing)|playsuit]], but swimsuits remained the highlight in the beauty contest.&lt;ref name="Kennedy2010" /&gt;

The first [[bikinis]] appeared just after [[World War II]]. Early examples were not very different from the women's two pieces common since the 1920s, except that they had a gap below the breast line allowing for a section of bare midriff. They were named after [[Bikini Atoll]], the site of several nuclear weapons tests, for their supposed explosive effect on the viewer. Beside [[Christian Dior]], some designers also launched the swimwear collection, such as Bob and Bill Meistrell of body glove and Robert and Jack O’Neill of the surf brand O’Neill.&lt;ref name="Kennedy2010" /&gt; Many of these pre-bikinis had fancy names like Double Entendre, Honey Child (to maximize [[Breast|small bosoms]]), Shipshape (to minimize [[Breast|large bosoms]]), Diamond Lil (trimmed with [[rhinestone]]s and [[lace]]), Swimming In Mink (trimmed with [[Fur clothing|fur]] across the [[bodice]]) and Spearfisherman (heavy [[poplin]] with a [[rope belt]] for carrying a knife), Beau Catcher, Leading Lady, Pretty Foxy, Side Issue, Forecast, and Fabulous Fit.&lt;ref name=WOJSI&gt;William Oscar Johnson , "[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1068171/3/index.htm In The Swim]", ''Sports Illustrated'', 1989-02-07&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bikini was banned from the [[Miss World contest]], following the crowning of [[Miss Sweden]]. Some people declared the bikini to be morally ‘indecent’. Even in Europe in 1950, there was an Italian magazine also declared that the Bikini should be worn purely for the sunbathing purposes or on board boats.&lt;ref name="Kennedy2010" /&gt;

According to ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' the swimwear had become more of "state of dress, not undress" by the mid-1950s.&lt;ref name=asseen/&gt; Bikini had a colorful period on the cinema screens and made an impact in the late 50s, inspired by the film such as [[And God Created Woman (1956 film)|And God Created Woman]] by [[Roger Vadim]], launched Bardot into the spotlight and became the benchmark for bikini on celluloid. Also, her outfit sets a whole new trend for sex symbols.&lt;ref name="Kennedy2010" /&gt;

Starting in the 1940s, the manufacturing advances enabled swimsuits to fit without the help of elastic, and aid as performance aid in competitive swimming.&lt;ref name="Kennedy2010" /&gt; In the early 1950s, other synthetics beside the screen print technique was being developed, such as polyester and acrylic, with quick-drying properties. In U.S, the [[Hawaii]]an -[[Japan]]ese- inspired prints were often used. In Europe, [[Emilio Pucci]] moved swimwear textile on a generation when he began to design prints for Rose Marrie Reid swimwear.&lt;ref name="Stevenson, N. J. 2012"/&gt;  By the late 1950s, new materials were developed and applied on the [[corsetry swimwear]], such as [[Lastex]], a fabric woven from artificial chromspun acetate that used for a more tightly fitted appearance. 

[[Speedo]] produced the wool and cotton swimwear for the Melbourne Olympics in 1956.&lt;ref name="Kennedy2010" /&gt; In 1956, Speedo became the first company to introduce [[nylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Daily News, pp. 9, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Men's swimsuits developed roughly in parallel to women's during this period, with the shorts covering progressively less. Racing-style "speedo" suits became popular, as did  [[Thong (clothing)|thongs]], [[G-string]]s, and [[bikini]] style briefs. Typically these are more popular in more [[tropical]] regions; however, they may also be worn at public [[swimming pool]]s and inland lakes. But in the 1990s, longer and baggier shorts became popular, with the hems often reaching to the knees. Often called boardshorts and swim trunks, these were worn lower on the hips than regular shorts.

==1960s==
In 1964 designer [[Rudi Gernreich]] conceived and produced the [[monokini]],&lt;ref name=alac&gt;{{cite book|last=Alac|first=Patrik|title=Bikini Story|year=2012|publisher=Parkstone International|ISBN=1780429517|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIj_GBl5sAoC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68}}&lt;/ref&gt; a revolutionary and controversial design included a bottom that "extended from the midriff to the upper thigh"&lt;ref name="everything"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everythingbikini.com/monokini.html |title= Bikini Styles: Monokini |publisher= Everything Bikini |accessdate=13 January 2013 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was "held up by shoestring laces that make a halter around the neck."&lt;ref name=nangle&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nangle|first1=Eleanore|title=Topless Swimsuit Causes Commotion|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/06/10/page/65/article/topless-swimsuit-causes-commotion|accessdate=20 August 2015|publisher=Chicago Tribute|date=June 10, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alac/&gt;

==1970s==
In the 1970s Speedo added [[Spandex|elastane]] to their swimsuits that improved their elasticity, durability and reduced water drag&amp;nbsp;– 21 out of 22 records at the 1972 Olympics were broken using nylon/elastane suits.&lt;ref name=Speedo1/&gt;

At the same Olympics, East German swimmers adopted suits that were tightly following the body shape, the so-called "skinsuits". They were initially made of cotton and became virtually transparent when wet. The revealing shape and transparency caused outrage among US swimmers; meanwhile, at the [[1973 World Aquatics Championships]], East German women won 10 of 14 events and set seven world records. Those championships became the turning point for the world to adopt the skinsuit, modified with novel synthetic materials, as a standard competitive swimwear.&lt;ref name=si&gt;Campbell, Jule (12 August 1974)  [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1088870/index.htm Light, Tight And Right For Racing]. sportsillustrated.cnn.com&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same era, East Germany became noteworthy for its nude beaches, an unusual freedom allowed in the regimented communist bloc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/06/travel/naked-germany/&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s==
In 1985, Gernreich unveiled the lesser known [[pubikini]], a bathing suit meant to expose [[pubic hair]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Gunther Stewart, Paula Spencer &amp; Dawn Danby, ''The V Book: A Doctor's Guide to Complete Vulvovaginal Health'', page 104, Bantam Books, 2002, {{ISBN|0-553-38114-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pubikini is a small piece of fabric that hugs the hips and buttocks but leaves the pubic region exposed,&lt;ref name="Metrwax" /&gt; described as a tiny V-shaped fabric strip and a piece de resistance totally freeing the human body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DP&amp;p_theme=dp&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB1DA884A3D966C&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Catalog adds options for overweight girls Article 1 of 1 found], ''Denver Post'', 1992-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; It featured a thong-style bottom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Recent acquisitions: A Selection, 1985-1986 |editor=Ellen Shultz|date=1986|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=978-0870994784|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the front was a tiny V-shaped strip of fabric that dipped below the woman's [[mons pubis]], exposing her [[pubic hair]] and portions of her [[vulva]].&lt;ref name="Metrwax"&gt;{{cite web |author=overzero.com |url=http://www.metroland.net/guides/2007_sum_guide/sum_waxing.html |title=Metroland |publisher=Metroland |accessdate=2012-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729120714/http://metroland.net/guides/2007_sum_guide/sum_waxing.html |archivedate=2012-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Gunther Stewart, Paula Spencer and Dawn Danby, ''The V Book'', page 104, Bantam Books, 2002, {{ISBN|0553381148}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was his last design, four weeks before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Honnef, Helmut Newton and Carol Squiers, ''Portraits: Photographs from Europe and America'', page 21, Schirmer, 2004, {{ISBN|382960131X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Horn, "Rudi Revisited", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 1991–11–17, page 03&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990s==
[[Tankini]] and the concept of mix-and-match [[swimwear]]s were the two major innovations in that genre in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Steele, ''Encyclopedia of Clothing and Fashion'', page 255, Charles Scribner's Sons, 2005, {{ISBN|0-684-31397-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designer [[Anne Cole]], the US swimwear mogul, was the originator of this style.&lt;ref name=homan&gt;Becky Homan, "[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB05184B3196071&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Tankini goes over the top]", Page 42, ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', 1999-04-03&lt;/ref&gt; Hailed as the first major innovation in women's swimsuit design in several decades, the two-piece tankini blended the freedom of a bikini with the more modest coverage of a one-piece bathing suit, and quickly captured nearly a third of the swimwear market.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Avery, ''Newsmakers '07: Cumulation'' page 117, Thomson Gale, 2007, {{ISBN|0-7876-8091-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose Apodaca Jones, "[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-10764345_ITM Five decades in the swim]", ''WWD'', Fairchild Publications, 2001-04-23&lt;/ref&gt; Aimed at closing a gap in the swimwear market, the popularity of tankini largely came from Cole's tapping into women's anxieties about swimwear.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Avery &amp; Thomson Gale, ''Newsmakers: Cumulation'', page 118, Thomson Gale, 2007, {{ISBN|0-7876-8091-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following its introduction tankinis diversified in style and range, adding other big name designers such as [[Ralph Lauren]], [[Donna Karan]], [[Nautica (clothing company)|Nautica]], and [[Calvin Klein]].&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Quinn, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/06/17/DI2005061700951_pf.html Stickline: Swimsuit Fashion for Women]", ''Washington Post'', 2005-06-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000s==
In 2005, a controversy broke out when [[Buddhist]]s complained against swimwear manufacturer Ondade Mar and lingerie giant [[Victoria's Secret]] started marketing tankinis featuring Buddhist iconography.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Nakamura, ''Digitizing Race'', page 186, University of Minnesota Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-8166-4613-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s breast cancer awareness swimwear collection featured four different cuts of tankini.&lt;ref&gt;Samantha Critchell, "[http://www.sptimes.com/2005/09/29/Floridian/Cancer_charities_pink.shtml Cancer charities pink at heart]", ''St. Petersburg Times'', 2005-09-29&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Speedo launched the [[Fastskin]] suit series that mimicked shark skin. Their surface contained bumps and ridges that channeled the water over the swimmer's body approximately 3% more efficiently than traditional materials.&lt;ref name=shark&gt;[http://www.epo.org/learning-events/european-inventor/finalists/2009/fairhurst.html A revolutionary swimsuit].

In July 2009, [[FINA]] voted to ban non-textile (non-woven) swimsuits in competitive events from 2010. The new policy was implemented to combat the issues associated with performance enhancing costumes, hindering the ability to accurately measure the performance of swimmers. Subsequently, the new ruling states that men's swimsuits may maximally cover the area from the navel to the knee, and women's' counterparts from the shoulder to the knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fina.org/project/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2537&amp;Itemid=49 |title=Fédération Internationale de Natation - fina.org - FINA GENERAL CONGRESS |author=Administrator |work=fina.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923103550/http://www.fina.org/project/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2537&amp;Itemid=49 |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/swimming/8161867.stm FINA bans hi-tech suits from 2010] BBC, 31 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In Search of...''''' is an American television series that was broadcast weekly from 1977 to 1982, devoted to mysterious phenomena. It was created after the success of three one-hour TV documentaries produced by creator [[Alan Landsburg]]: ''In Search of Ancient Astronauts'' in 1973 (based on the book ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'' by [[Erich von Däniken]]), ''In Search of Ancient Mysteries'' and ''[[The Outer Space Connection]]'', both in 1975 (later adapted into popular paperbacks written by Landsburg). All three featured narration by [[Rod Serling]], who was the initial choice to host the spin-off show. Serling died before production started, with [[Leonard Nimoy]] then selected to be the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3334003/r-p-leonard-nimoy-passes-away-age-83/|title=R.I.P. Leonard Nimoy Passes Away At Age 83|website=bloody-disgusting.com|accessdate=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was revived with host [[Mitch Pileggi]] in 2002 and again in 2018 with [[Zachary Quinto]], currently airing on the [[History Channel]].

== Format ==
The program conducted investigations into the controversial and [[paranormal]] (e.g., [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]s, [[Bigfoot]], and the [[Loch Ness Monster]]). Additionally, it featured episodes about mysterious historical events and personalities such as [[Anna Anderson]]/[[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]], the [[Abraham Lincoln#Assassination|Lincoln Assassination]], the [[Jack the Ripper]] murders, infamous cults (e.g., [[Jim Jones]]), and missing persons, cities, and ships (e.g., [[Amelia Earhart]], [[Jimmy Hoffa]], [[D. B. Cooper]], the ''[[Mary Celeste]]'', the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'', the lost [[Roanoke Colony]]). Because the show often presented offbeat subjects and controversial theories, each episode's opening credits included a verbal disclaimer about the conjectural nature of the evidence and theories to be presented:

{{cquote|This series presents information based in part on theory and conjecture. The producer's purpose is to suggest some possible explanations, but not necessarily the only ones, to the mysteries we will examine.}}

The production values were fairly typical of the period, with interviews, reenactments and scenic footage shot on film, all voiced over by Nimoy. The music was composed by Laurin M. Rinder and W. Michael Lewis. A soundtrack album was released on AVI (American Variety International) Records in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Release catalog number AVL 6008 by American Variety International Records Distributing Corp. 9220 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, California 90069.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nimoy's popularity among [[science fiction]] fans (due to his role as [[Spock]] in the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' television series) won the show a following in [[fandom]] circles. Nimoy wrote an episode about the turbulent life of artist [[Vincent van Gogh]], having earlier played the artist's brother Theo in a one-man show. As part of his research, Nimoy found records in the archives of the hospital where Van Gogh was treated that suggested that he suffered from [[epilepsy]] rather than insanity.

The show also spawned at least six spin-off books, all written by Landsburg with forewords by Nimoy: ''In Search of Lost Civilizations,'' ''In Search of Extraterrestrials,'' ''In Search of Magic and Witchcraft,'' ''In Search of Strange Phenomena,'' ''In Search of Missing Persons,'' and ''In Search of Myths and Monsters,'' with an additional book that collected the best segments from these existing volumes.

In 1978, Landsburg produced a Bigfoot documentary using portions of two ''In Search of...'' episodes ("The Monster Hunters" and "The Yeti") called ''Manbeast! Myth or Monster,'' based on his book ''In Search of Myths and Monsters.'' Though Nimoy had written the foreword to Landsburg's book, he did not narrate this documentary.

Reruns of the ''In Search of...'' series aired during the early 1990s on the [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E Network]]. In the later 1990s, the show aired on another of the [[A&amp;E Television Networks]]' properties, the [[History (U.S. TV network)|History Channel]]. The licensing agreement expired in the early 2000s, ending the show's run. When the show aired on A&amp;E, a re-recording of the original theme music was used plus a new alternate theme. The original opening titles were also modernized. In this incarnation virtually all of Nimoy's on-camera appearances in the series were replaced with reused footage, so viewers could hear Nimoy but not see him.

A short-lived revival of the show, featuring [[Mitch Pileggi]], aired on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in 2002.

In January 2018, it was announced that [[Zachary Quinto]], who, like Nimoy, stars as [[Spock]] in the rebooted [[Star Trek (film series)#Reboot (Kelvin Timeline) films|''Star Trek'' films]], will host the revived version of the show on History Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2018/01/history-in-search-of-zachary-quinto/|title=Zachary Quinto investigates the paranormal on History’s revival of In Search Of – reality blurred|date=January 30, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4804">'''Jacob Leib Talmon''' ([[Hebrew]]: יעקב טלמון; June 14, 1916 &amp;ndash; June 16, 1980) was Professor of Modern History at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He has been categorised as a '[[Cold War liberal]]' because of the [[anti-Marxism]] which permeates his main works.

He studied the [[genealogy]] of [[totalitarianism]], arguing that political [[Messianism]] stemmed from the [[French Revolution]], and stressed the similarities between [[Jacobinism]] and [[Stalinism]]. He coined the terms "[[totalitarian democracy]]" and "[[Messianic democracy]]/[[political Messianism]]".

==Biography==
Talmon was born in [[Rypin]], a town in central Poland, into an orthodox [[Jewish]] family. He left in 1934 to study at the Hebrew University in [[Jerusalem]], then in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], now [[Israel]]. He continued his studies in France but left for London after the Nazi invasion; in 1943 he was awarded a [[PhD]] from the [[London School of Economics]]. His main works are ''The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy'' and ''Political Messianism: The Romantic Phase''. Talmon argued that [[Rousseau]]'s position may best be understood as "totalitarian democracy", a philosophy in which liberty is realized "only in the pursuit and attainment of an absolute collective purpose." Following the [[1967 Six-Day War]], Talmon engaged in a debate with [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] on the role of Jews and Zionism in history.&lt;ref&gt;Hedva Ben-Israel, "Debates With Toynbee: Herzog, Talmon, Friedman," ''[[Israel Studies]]'' (Spring 2006), pp. 83ff; and two newspaper reports in Hebrew: Jacob Talmon, "Arnold Toynbee and His Relationship to the Jews," ''[[Haaretz]]'', Sept. 5, 1956 and "The Exchange of Letters Between Professor Arnold Toynbee and Professor Y. Talmon following the Six-Day War," ''[[Maariv]]'', Aug. 4, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Talmon died in [[Jerusalem]] on June 16, 1980, two days after his 64th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[[David K. Shipler]], "J.L. Talmon is dead; an Israeli historian," ''[[The New York Times]]'', 18 June 1980, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 1957, Talmon was awarded the [[Israel Prize]], for [[social sciences]].&lt;ref name=prize&gt;{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site - Recipients in 1956 (in Hebrew)| url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashtaz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16749">{{about|the ''nengō'' element of the Japanese era calendar scheme|the computer software known as "NENGO"|Neural Engineering Object}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2016}}
{{more footnotes|date=January 2010}}

The {{nihongo|'''Japanese era name'''|年号|nengō|"year name"}}, also known as {{nihongo|''gengō''|元号}}, is the first of the two elements that identify years in the '''Japanese era calendar scheme'''. The second element, a number, counts the years since the era began; as in many other systems, there is no [[year zero]]. For example, the first year of the [[Heisei period]] was {{nowrap|1989 [[Common Era|CE]]}}, or "Heisei 1", so the year {{CURRENTYEAR}} CE in this scheme is "Heisei {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1988}}".

As elsewhere in East Asia, the use of ''nengō'' was originally derived from [[Chinese era name|Chinese Imperial practice]], although the Japanese system is independent of the [[Chinese era name|Chinese]], [[Korean era name|Korean]], and [[Vietnamese era name|Vietnamese]] era-naming systems. Unlike some of these other similar systems, Japanese era names are still in use. Government offices usually require era names and years for official papers.

The four era names used since the end of the [[Edo period]] in 1868 can be abbreviated by taking the first letter of their [[Hepburn romanization|romanized]] names. For example, S55 means Shōwa 55 (i.e. 1980), and H22 stands for Heisei 22 (2010). At 62 years and 2 weeks, [[Shōwa period|Shōwa]] is the longest era to date.{{update after|{{#expr:1988+64}} }}

== Current ==
The current period is known as {{Nihongo|"[[Heisei]]"|平成}}. It started on 8 January 1989, the day after the death of the [[Emperor Hirohito]]. His son, the 125th [[Emperor Akihito]], [[Enthronement of the Japanese Emperor|acceded to the throne]]. It is scheduled to end on 30 April 2019, his planned date of [[Abdication]].

== Overview ==
{{External timeline|Template:Timeline of Japanese era names|Timeline of Japanese era names}}

The system on which the Japanese era names are based originated in China in 140 BCE, and was adopted by Japan in 645 CE, during the reign of [[Emperor Kōtoku]].

The first era name to be assigned was {{nihongo|"Taika"|大化}}, celebrating the political and organizational changes which were to flow from the great {{nihongo|[[Taika reform]]|大化の改新}} of 645. Although the regular practice of proclaiming successive era names was interrupted in the late seventh century, it was permanently re-adopted in 701 during the reign of Emperor Monmu (697–707). Since then, era names have been used continuously up through the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Delmer ''et al.'' (1979). ''Gukanshō,'' p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical ''nengō''===
Prior to the [[Meiji period]], era names were decided by court officials and were subjected to frequent change. A new era name was usually proclaimed within a year or two after the ascension of a new emperor. A new era name was also often designated on the first, fifth and 58th years of the [[sexagenary cycle]], because they were inauspicious years in [[Onmyōdō]]. These three years are respectively known as ''[[wiktionary:革令|kakurei]]'', ''[[wiktionary:革運|kakuun]]'', and ''[[wiktionary:革命|kakumei]]'', and collectively known as ''[[wiktionary:三革|sankaku]]''. Era names were also changed due to other felicitous events or natural disasters.

In historical practice, {{nihongo|the first day of a nengō|元年|gannen}} starts whenever the emperor chooses; and the first year continues until the next lunar new year, which is understood to be the start of the nengō's second year.&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1956). ''Kyoto: the Old Capital of Japan, 794–1869,'' p. 321.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Era names indicate the various reasons for their adoption. For instance, the nengō {{nihongo|Wadō|和銅}}, during the Nara period, was declared due to the discovery of copper deposits in [[Chichibu]]. Most nengō are composed of two [[kanji]], except for a short time during the [[Nara period]] when four-kanji names were sometimes adopted to follow the Chinese trend. {{nihongo|Tenpyō Kanpō|天平感宝}}, {{nihongo|Tenpyō Shōhō|天平勝宝}}, {{nihongo|Tenpyō Hōji|天平宝字}} and {{nihongo|Tenpyō Jingo|天平神護}} are some famous nengō names that use four characters. Since the [[Heian period]], [[Confucian]] thoughts and ideas have been reflected in era names, such as {{nihongo|Daidō|大同}}, {{nihongo|Kōnin|弘仁}} and {{nihongo|Tenchō|天長}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}  Although there currently exist a total of 247 Japanese era names, only 72 kanji have been used in composing them. Out of these 72 kanji, 30 of them have been used only once, while the rest have been used repeatedly in different combinations.

===''Nengō'' in modern Japan===
[[Mutsuhito]] assumed the throne in 1867, during the third year of the {{nihongo|[[Keiō]]|慶応}} era. On 23 October 1868, the era name was changed to {{nihongo|"[[Meiji period|Meiji]]"|明治}}, and a {{nihongo|"one reign, one era name"|一世一元|issei-ichigen}} system was adopted, wherein era names would change only upon immediate imperial succession. This system is similar to the now-defunct Chinese system used since the days of the [[Ming Dynasty]]. The Japanese nengō system differs from Chinese practice, in that in the Chinese system the era name was not updated until the year following the emperor's death.

In modern practice, {{nihongo|the first year of a nengō|元年|gannen}} starts immediately upon the emperor's accession and ends on 31 December. Subsequent years follow the [[Gregorian calendar]].

For example, the Meiji Era lasted until 30 July 1912, when the Emperor died and the {{nihongo|[[Taishō]]|大正}} era was proclaimed. 1912 is therefore known as both "Meiji 45" and {{nihongo|"Taishō 1"|大正元年|Taishō gannen}}, although Meiji technically ended on 30 July with Mutsuhito's death.

This practice, implemented successfully since the days of Meiji but never formalized, became law in 1979 with the passage of the {{nihongo|Era Name Law|元号法|gengō-hō}}. Thus, since 1868, there have only been four era names assigned: Meiji, Taishō, Shōwa and Heisei, each corresponding with the rule of only one emperor. Upon death, the emperor is thereafter referred to by the era of his reign. For example, Mutsuhito is posthumously known as {{nihongo|"[[Emperor Meiji]]"|明治天皇|Meiji Tennō}}.
 
It is protocol in Japan that the reigning emperor be referred to as {{nihongo|''Tennō Heika''|天皇陛下|"His Imperial Majesty the Emperor"}} or {{nihongo|''Kinjō Tennō''|今上天皇|"current emperor"}}. To call the current emperor by the current era name, i.e. "Heisei", even in English, is a faux pas, as this is—and will be—his posthumous name. Use of the emperor's given name (i.e., "Akihito") is rare, and is considered vulgar behaviour in Japanese.

The current Emperor is scheduled to abdicate on 30 April 2019, necessating a change in nengō. It is believed that the new name will be made public in advance.

== Periods without era names ==

The era name system that was introduced by [[Emperor Kōtoku]] was abandoned after his death; no era names were designated between 654 and 686. The system was briefly reinstated by [[Emperor Tenmu]] in 686, but was again abandoned upon his death about two months later. In 701, [[Emperor Monmu]] once again reinstated the era name system, and it has continued uninterrupted through today.

Although use of the [[Gregorian calendar]] for historical dates became increasingly common in Japan, the traditional Japanese system demands that dates be written in reference to era names. The apparent problem introduced by the lack of era names was resolved by identifying the years of an imperial reign as a period.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, David. (1894). {{Google books|ez0qAAAAYAAJ|''The Story of Japan,'' p. 402|page=402}}, citing William Bramsen. (1880). {{Google books|9jKgVty_XFoC|''Japanese Chronological Tables,'' pp. 54–55|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in modern Japan posthumous imperial names correspond with the eras of their reign, this is a relatively recent concept, introduced in practice during the [[Meiji period]] and instituted by law in 1979. Therefore, the posthumous names of the emperors and empresses who reigned prior to 1868 may not be taken as era names by themselves. For example, the year 572—the year in which [[Emperor Bidatsu]] assumed the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] – is properly written as "{{lang|ja|敏達天皇元年}}" (''Bidatsu-Tennō Gannen'', lit. "the first year of Emperor Bidatsu"), and not "{{lang|ja|敏達元年}}" (''Bidatsu Gannen'', lit. "the first year of Bidatsu"), although it may be abbreviated as such.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndl.go.jp/koyomi/e/ "The Japanese Calendar"], National Diet Library, Japan&lt;/ref&gt; By incorporating both proper era names and posthumous imperial names in this manner, it is possible to extend the nengō system to cover all dates from 660 BCE through today.&lt;ref&gt;{{jp}} [http://homepage1.nifty.com/gyouseinet/history/nengouichiran.htm 年号一覧] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019050706/http://homepage1.nifty.com/gyouseinet/history/nengouichiran.htm |date=19 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unofficial era name system ==
In addition to the official era name system, in which the era names are selected by the imperial court, one also observes—primarily in the ancient documents and epigraphs of shrines and temples—unofficial era names called {{nihongo |''shinengō''|私年号}}, also known as {{nihongo |''ginengō''|偽年号}} or {{nihongo |''inengō''|異年号}}. Currently, there are over 40 confirmed shinengō, most of them dating from the [[middle ages]]. ''Shinengō'' used prior to the reestablishment of the era name system in 701 are usually called {{nihongo |''itsunengō''|逸年号}}. A list of shinengō and more information can be seen in the Japanese language entry on {{lang|ja|[[:ja:私年号#日本の私年号一覧|私年号]]}}.

Because official records of ''shinengō'' are lacking, the range of dates to which they apply is often unclear. For example, the well-known itsunengō {{nihongo |Hakuhō|白鳳}} is normally said to refer to 650–654 CE; a poetic synonym for the [[Hakuchi (era)|Hakuchi era]]. However, alternate interpretations exist. For example, in the [[Nichūreki]], Hakuhō refers to 661–683 CE, and in some medieval temple documents, Hakuhō refers to 672–685 CE. Thus, shinengō may be used as an alternative way of dating periods for which there is no official era name.

Other well-known ''itsunengō'' and ''shinengō'' include {{nihongo |Hōkō|法興}} (591–621+ CE), {{nihongo |Suzaku|朱雀}} (686), {{nihongo |Fukutoku|福徳}} (1489–1492), {{nihongo|Miroku|弥勒}} (1506–1507 or 1507–1509) and {{nihongo |Meiroku|命禄}} (1540–1543).

The most recent ''shinengō'' is {{nihongo |Seiro|征露}} (1904–1905), named for the [[Russo-Japanese War]].

===''Kyūshū nengō''===
Edo period scholar [[Tsurumine Shikenobu]] proposed that {{nihongo |Kyūshū nengō|九州年号}}, said to have been used in ancient [[Kumaso]], should also be considered a form of ''shinengō''. This claim is not generally recognized by the academic community. Lists of the proposed ''Kyūshū nengō'' can be seen in the Japanese language entries {{lang|ja|[[:ja:鶴峯戊申#襲国偽僣考|鶴峯戊申]]}} and {{lang|ja|[[:ja:九州王朝説#九州年号表|九州王朝説]]}}.

==Software support==
Since the release of [[Java 8]], the Japanese calendar is supported in the new Date and time API for the year Meiji 6 (1873) onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=JapaneseDate (Java Platform SE 8 )|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/chrono/JapaneseDate.html |deadurl=no |archive-date=2015-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515211441/https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/chrono/JapaneseDate.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Japanese imperial transition, 2019|a new era anticipated to begin on 1 May, 2019]], computers and software manufacturers will need to test their systems for the new era.  Windows provides a test mechanism to simulate a new era ahead of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/shawnste/2018/04/12/the-japanese-calendars-y2k-moment/|title=The Japanese Calendar's Y2K Moment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Java Development Kit 11 supports this era using the placeholders "元号" for Japanese, "NewEra" for other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=JDK 11 Release Notes, Important Changes, and Information |url=https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/11-relnote-issues-5012449.html#JDK-8202088 |website=www.oracle.com |accessdate=1 October 2018 |quote=Japanese calendars, both in java.time.chrono and java.util packages support the upcoming Japanese new era, which will be in effect from May 1st, 2019. At the moment, the name of the era is not yet known, placeholder names ("元号" for Japanese, "NewEra" for other languages) are provided for its display names. The placeholder names will be replaced with the legitimate era name in a future update, thus applications should not depend on those placeholder names.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final name will be added in JDK 12.0.1, once it is announced by the Japanese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kishida |first1=Naoki |title=Java 11 API Change Proposals |url=https://dzone.com/articles/java-11-api-changes-so-far |website=DZone Java |accessdate=1 October 2018 |language=en |date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Front view of the ICTY.jpg|thumb|Building of [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] in [[Hague]].]]
'''Joint criminal enterprise''' ('''JCE''') is a [[legal doctrine]] used during [[war crimes]] tribunals to allow the prosecution of members of a group for the actions of the group. This doctrine considers each member of an organized group individually responsible for crimes committed by group within the common plan or purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambodiatribunal.org/blog/Joint-Criminal-Enterprise-and-the-Khmer-Rouge-Prosecutions.html John Ciorciari, Joint Criminal Enterprise and the Khmer Rouge Prosecutions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214205815/http://www.cambodiatribunal.org/blog/Joint-Criminal-Enterprise-and-the-Khmer-Rouge-Prosecutions.html |date=2009-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It arose through the application of the idea of [[common purpose]] and has been applied by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] to prosecute political and military leaders for mass war crimes, including [[genocide]], committed during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] 1991–1999.

For example, "if three people commit a bank robbery and one fatally shoots a person in the process, the law considers all guilty of [[murder]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04242/368273.stm Atrocities in Yugoslavia unraveled much later]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "collective liability" where more than one person can share liability and punishment for the actions of another person is not universally accepted and is considered by some to be a form of human rights abuse, while others believe it is just.

==Definition==
{{quote|Without a certain degree of cooperation and coordination of actions, it is virtually impossible to perpetrate atrocities such as [[genocide]] or [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanstudents.us/Pages%20from%20Guliyeva.pdf Gunel Guliyeva, The Concept of Joint Criminal Enterprise and ICC Jurisdiction] (retrieved 29.12.2009.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first usages of joint criminal enterprise doctrine are identified in post-[[World War II]] cases, in which the doctrine was used under the name [[common purpose]] (or joint enterprise), or without specific naming.&lt;ref name="Pjanić"&gt;Jasmina Pjanic (OKO lawyer), [http://www.okobih.ba/files/docs/Jasmina_Pjanic_ENG_i_BHS.pdf Joint Criminal Enterprise New form of individual criminal responsibility]. Retrieved 29 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the origins of the doctrine may be influenced by the Common Law of England, which introduced the principle into criminal law in the UK and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations such as Australia.  A similar legal principle can also be found in Texas, USA, where it is known as the Law of Parties. The notion of collective liability and shared punishment for the actions of others as if all perpetrated the same deed may be much older, and was used to justify extermination of religious and cultural groups, such as the Albigensian "Heretics" and those who harbored them. Critics argue that Joint Criminal Enterprise can lead to excessive legal process and punishments, that it lowers the evidential bar in favour of prosecution, and that it runs counter to the spirit of [[Blackstone's formulation]].  Supporters argue that it ensures those contributing to or instigating a criminal act are properly made to account for their involvement.

The first reference to joint criminal enterprise and its constituent elements was provided in Tadic case 1999.&lt;ref name="Pjanić"/&gt;

The Appeals Chamber of the ICTY decided on 21 May 2003 on the following definitions:&lt;ref name=ICTY-AC&gt;ICTY Appeals Chamber "[http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/jud_supplement/supp41-e/milutinovic-a.htm Decision on Dragoljub Ojdanic's Motion Challenging Jurisdiction - Joint Criminal Enterprise]", The Prosecutor v. Milutinovic et al. - Case No. IT-99-37-AR72, 21 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|
:&lt;u&gt;The Tribunal's jurisdiction ''[[ratione personae]]''&lt;/u&gt;: in order to fall within the Tribunal's jurisdiction ratione personae, any form of liability must satisfy four preconditions: (i) it must be provided for in the Statute, explicitly or implicitly; (ii) it must have existed under customary international law at the relevant time; (iii) the law providing for that form of liability must have been sufficiently foreseeable at the relevant time to anyone who acted in such a way; and (iv) such person must have been able to foresee that he could be held criminally liable for his actions if apprehended.

:&lt;u&gt;Joint criminal enterprise and the Tribunal's Statute&lt;/u&gt;: the reference to that crime or to that form of liability does not need to be explicit to come within the purview of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The Statute of the ICTY is not and does not purport to be a meticulously detailed code providing for every possible scenario and every solution thereto. It sets out in somewhat general terms the jurisdictional framework within which the Tribunal has been mandated to operate. The list in Article 7(1) appears to be non-exhaustive in nature as the use of the phrase 'or otherwise aided and abetted' suggests.

:&lt;u&gt;The nature of joint criminal enterprise&lt;/u&gt;: insofar as a participant shares the purpose of the joint criminal enterprise (as he or she must do) as opposed to merely knowing about it, he or she cannot be regarded as a mere aider and abettor to the crime which is contemplated. Joint criminal enterprise is a form of 'commission' pursuant to Article 7(1) of the Statute.

:&lt;u&gt;Joint criminal enterprise and conspiracy&lt;/u&gt;: joint criminal enterprise and 'conspiracy' are two different forms of liability. While mere agreement is sufficient in the case of conspiracy, the liability of a member of a joint criminal enterprise will depend on the commission of criminal acts in furtherance of that enterprise.

:&lt;u&gt;Joint criminal enterprise and membership in a criminal organisation&lt;/u&gt;: criminal liability pursuant to joint criminal enterprise is not a liability for mere membership or for conspiring to commit crimes but a form of liability concerned with the participation in the commission of a crime as part of a joint criminal enterprise, a different matter.
|Appeals Chamber of the ICTY,  21 May 2003.&lt;ref name=ICTY-AC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICTY Statute article 7(1) "A person who planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and abetted in the planning, preparation or execution of a crime referred to in articles 2 to 5 of the present Statute, shall be individually responsible for the crime."
&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Writing about this finding in the Journal of International Criminal Justice in 2004, Steven Powles (a [[barrister]] who has appeared as a defence council in matters before the ICTY and the Special Court for Sierra Leone) states that the Appeals Chamber was obliged to make this declaration because there was no specific mention of "joint criminal enterprise" in the court's statutes and that "this is not ideal [because] criminal law, especially international criminal law, requires clear and certain definitions of the various bases of liability, so as to enable the parties, both the prosecution and, perhaps more importantly, the defence to prepare for and conduct the trial."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Powles,''[http://jicj.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/2/2/606 Joint Criminal Enterprise]'' Journal of International Criminal Justice 2004 2(2):606-619; {{doi|10.1093/jicj/2.2.606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post World War II trials==
{{Main|Nuremberg Trials}}

In the aftermath of World War II, the courts established by British and [[United States]] in Germany applied this doctrine in the trials against [[Nazis]].&lt;ref name="Pjanić"/&gt; The Italian Supreme Court applied a similar doctrine in the trials against [[fascists]].&lt;ref name="Pjanić"/&gt;

===Concentration camp cases===
[[File:Bergen Belsen Liberation 01.jpg|thumb|Former guards of [[Belsen Concentration Camp]] load the bodies of dead prisoners onto a lorry for burial (April 1945).]]

Possibly, the most well-known post World War II cases are the [[Dachau Concentration Camp]] case, decided by a United States court, and the [[Belsen]] case, decided by a British military court, both sitting in Germany.&lt;ref name="Pjanić"/&gt; In these cases, the accused held position of [[authority]] within the [[hierarchy]] of the [[Nazi concentration camps]] and based on that were found guilty of the charges that they had acted in pursuance of a common plan to kill or mistreat prisoners.&lt;ref name="Pjanić"/&gt;

===Essen Lynching case===
The Essen lynching case, conducted before a British military court, demonstrates the closest link to the joint criminal enterprise doctrine.&lt;ref name="Pjanić"/&gt; In that case three British airmen [[prisoners of war]] had been [[Lynching|lynch]]ed by a mob of Germans in the [[Essen]] on 13 December 1944.

Seven persons were charged with committing a war crime, included a German captain, who had placed prisoners under the escort of a German soldier. While the escort with the prisoners was leaving, the captain had ordered him not to interfere if German civilians molested the prisoners. This order had been given in a loud voice so that the gathering crowd could hear. When the prisoners of war were marched through one of the main streets of Essen, the crowd grew bigger, started hitting them and throwing stones. When they reached the bridge, the prisoners were thrown over the parapet of the bridge; one of the airmen was killed by the fall and the two others were killed by members of the crowd.&lt;ref name="Pjanić"/&gt;

==Post Yugoslav War trials==
{{Main|International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|Yugoslav War}}

The use of the JCE as an actual criminal investigation and prosecution theory first appeared at the ICTY through a written proposal to Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte, which was developed and authored by American prosecutor Dermot Groome, at the time the legal officer for the Bosnia case, and American Investigator John Cencich, head of the Milosevic investigation for crimes alleged to have been committed in Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/icty/miloseviccroatiaindtmt100801.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=jeVby4pR3UQC&amp;dq=carla+madame+prosecutor&amp;cd=1&lt;/ref&gt; Cencich provides an in-depth look at the actual development of the investigation and prosecution theory of the JCE in his doctoral dissertation at the University of Notre Dame,&lt;ref&gt;John Robert Cencich: [https://books.google.com/books?id=OYletwAACAAJ&amp;dq=cencich+war+and+crime&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HE7WUOvuEOiv0AGJlIFg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA.

===Indictments to Serb leaders===
The ICTY prosecutor indicted [[Slobodan Milosevic]] on three separate indictments which on appeal they successfully pleaded to the ICTY Appeals Chamber should considered as one indictment. As the prosecution had not used the same language in all three indictments it was left to the Court of Appeal to decide if the alleged criminal enterprises in the three  indictments were one of the same and what was common between the allegations.

===Indictments to Croat leaders===
[[File:Former Yugoslavia durning war.svg|thumb|Former Yugoslavia during war]]

ICTY found in a first-instance verdict that general [[Ante Gotovina]] participated in a joint criminal enterprise with Croatian President [[Franjo Tuđman]] with the goal to do "the forcible and permanent removal of the Serb population from the [territory occupied by the forces of the] [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]]". Nevertheless, ICTY's appeals chamber acquitted Ante Gotovina, Ivan Čermak and Mladen Markač of all charges, including the one of participation in the joint criminal enterprise.

In May 2013, [[Jadranko Prlić]] and others were found guilty for taking part in the joint criminal enterprise with Croatian President Franjo Tuđman for crimes committed in the [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia]] against Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/05/2013529181535511569.html Bosnian Croat leaders convicted of war crimes], Al Jazeera&lt;/ref&gt;  However, on 19 July 2016, the Appeals Chamber concluded that the "Trial Chamber made no explicit findings concerning [Tuđman's] participation in the joint criminal enterprise and did not find [him] guilty of any crimes." &lt;ref&gt;[http://miseticlaw.blogspot.com/2016/07/icty-reverses-findings-on-tudjman-susak.html?_sm_au_=iVVSpFV7pQZQDCnH ICTY reverses findings on Tudjman, Šušak participation in the joint criminal enterprise in Herceg Bosna], MiseticLaw&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rwandan Genocide trials==
{{Main|International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda|Rwandan Genocide}}

The [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] ('''ICTR''') is an [[international court]] established in November 1994 by the [[United Nations Security Council]] in order to judge people responsible for the [[Rwandan genocide]] and other serious violations of the [[international law]] in [[Rwanda]], or by Rwandan citizens in nearby states, between 1 January and 31 December 1994.&lt;ref name="UN_SRES9551994"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-955(1994) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=1994 |resolution_number=955 |accessdate=2008-07-23|date=8 November 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Rwanda trials, the Prosecution originally alleged that the genocidal common plan had been drawn up in 1990 but this theory was dismissed in December 2008 when the defendants in the mammoth "Military I" trial were acquitted of conspiracy to commit genocide.&lt;ref name="Laughland"&gt;[http://www.heritagetpirdefense.org/papers/John_laughland_Conspiracy_joint_criminal_enterprise_and_command_responsibility.pdf John Laughland: Conspiracy, joint criminal enterprise and command responsibility in international criminal law]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[John Laughland]], author of ''Travesty: The Trial of Slobodan Milosevic and the Corruption of International Justice'', criticized the Joint Criminal Enterprise doctrine. He stated that successive rulings of the ICTY Appeals Chamber have allowed this doctrine "to get wildly out of hand". The judgement in Kvocka ruled that "JCE responsibility does not require any showing of superior responsibility, nor the proof of a substantial or significant contribution." In Brdjanin, it ruled that "the third category of joint criminal enterprise does not require proof of intent to commit a crime."&lt;ref name="Laughland"/&gt;

{{quote|The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia...has invented a doctrine of criminal liability known as ‘joint criminal enterprise.’ It uses this concept, which is so contentious that it is unconstitutional in many jurisdictions, in order to convict people of crimes when even the Tribunal accepts that they did not, in fact, commit them or that the proof is lacking to show that they did.|[[John Laughland]]}}

He argues thus that "international tribunals have abolished the very thing which criminal trials are supposed to be about. If you can be convicted of a crime as a primary perpetrator for something which you neither committed nor intended to commit, and if [[mens rea]]  can be ‘established’ by judicial ruling," this is "introducing into the heart of their systems measures which are the very hallmark of dictatorships." The chapter in Laughland's book ''Travesty'' on the subject of the Joint Criminal Enterprise doctrine is titled  "Just convict everyone."

Laughland is not alone in criticizing the application of this doctrine.  Torunn Salomonsen has taken a similar position in her Ph.D. thesis http://sciencenordic.com/due-process-law-toned-down-international-criminal-courts

Joint Criminal Enterprise is found in some nations and states and may have its roots in the Common Law of England, where its application has prompted the formation in 2011 of a campaign group JENGbA http://www.jointenterprise.co - JENGbA seeks to curtail the use of Joint Enterprise and claims its misuse constitutes a human rights abuse.
Joint Criminal Enterprise as a legal concept has been used at the ICTY and - to a lesser extent - at the ICTR, as well as in the Special Court for Sierra Leone. But it is not part of the International Criminal Court's (ICC) Rome Statute. The ICC instead uses the notion of co-perpetratorship, which a number of ICTY judges had tried to introduce at the ICTY instead of JCE.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Bachmann, Aleksandar Fatić: The UN International Criminal Tribunals.

'''Language &lt;i&gt;localisation&lt;/i&gt;''' (or '''&lt;i&gt;localization&lt;/i&gt;''', see [[American and British English spelling differences#iseize|spelling-differences]]) is the process of adapting a product that has been previously translated into multiple languages to a specific country or region (from [[Latin]] ''locus'' (place) and the English term ''[[locale (computer software)|locale]]'', "a place where something happens or is set").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2005|title=locale|encyclopedia=The New Oxford American Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second phase of a larger process of product translation and cultural adaptation (for specific countries, regions, or groups) to account for differences in distinct markets, a process known as [[internationalization and localization|internationalisation and localisation]].


Language localisation differs from [[Translation|translation activity]] because it involves a comprehensive study of the target culture in order to correctly adapt the product to local needs. Localisation can be referred to by the [[numeronym]] '''L10N''' (as in: "L", followed by ten more letters, and then "N").

The localisation process is most generally related to the cultural adaptation and translation of [[software]], [[video games]], and [[website]]s, as well as audio/[[voiceover]], [[video]], or other [[multimedia]] content, and less frequently to any written translation (which may also involve cultural adaptation processes). Localisation can be done for regions or countries where people speak different languages or where the same language is spoken. For instance, different [[German dialects|dialects of German]], with [[Idiom|different idioms]], are spoken in [[Standard German|Germany]], [[Austrian German|Austria]], [[Swiss German|Switzerland]], and [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|Belgium]].

== The overall process: internationalisation, globalisation and localisation ==
The former [[Localization Industry Standards Association]] (LISA) said that globalisation "can best be thought of as a cycle rather than a single process".&lt;ref name="lisa-whatis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lisa.org/What-Is-Globalization.48.0.html |title=What is Globalization? |work=LISA |publisher=Localization Industry Standards Association |accessdate=6 September 2010 |location=Romainmôtier, Switzerland |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101205931/http://www.lisa.org/What-Is-Globalization.48.0.html |archivedate=January 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To ''globalise'' is to plan the design and development methods for a product in advance, keeping in mind a multicultural audience, in order to avoid increased costs and quality problems, save time, and smooth the localising effort for each region or country. Localisation is an integral part of the overall process called '''globalisation'''.
[[File:Globalisationchart.jpg|thumb|400px|The globalisation process &lt;br/&gt;(based on a chart from the LISA website.)&lt;ref name="lisa-whatis"/&gt;]]
There are two primary technical processes that comprise globalisation: internationalisation and localisation.

The first phase, '''internationalisation''', encompasses the planning and preparation stages for a product that is built by design to support global markets. This process removes all cultural assumptions, and any country- or language-specific content is stored so that it can be easily adapted. If this content is not separated during this phase, it must be fixed during localisation, adding time and expense to the project. In extreme cases, products that were not internationalised may not be localisable.

The second phase, '''localisation''', refers to the actual adaptation of the product for a specific market. The localisation phase involves, among other things, the four issues LISA describes as ''linguistic'', ''physical'', ''business and cultural'', and ''technical'' issues.

At the end of each phase, testing (including [[quality assurance]]) is performed to ensure that the product works properly and meets the client's quality expectations.

=== Translation versus localisation ===

Though it is sometimes difficult to draw the limits between translation and localisation, in general localisation addresses significant, non-textual components of products or services. In addition to translation (and, therefore, [[grammar]] and [[spelling|spelling issues]] that vary from place to place where the same language is spoken), the localisation process might include adapting graphics; adopting local currencies; using proper format for date and time, addresses, and phone numbers applicable to the location; the choices of colours; cultural references; and many other details, including rethinking the physical structure of a product. All these changes aim to recognise local sensitivities, avoid conflict with local culture, customs, common habits, and enter the local market by merging into its needs and desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://blog.ititranslates.com/the-importance-of-website-localization-in-a-global-marketplace-part-2|title=The Importance Of Website Localization In A Global Marketplace|last=Pagano|first=Annie|date=June 2018|journal=Interpreter and Translators, Inc.|publisher=Interpreters and Translators, Inc.|location=Glastonbury,Connecticut}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, localisation aims to offer country-specific websites of the same company or different editions of a book depending on where it is published. It must be kept in mind that a political entity such as a country is not the same as a language or culture; even in countries where there exists a substantially identical relationship between a language and a political entity, there are almost certainly multiple cultures and multiple minority languages even if the minority languages are spoken by transient populations. For instance, [[Japan]]'s national language is [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and is the primary language for [[Japan#Languages|over 99% of the population]], but the country also recognises [[Languages of Japan|11 languages officially, others are spoken by transient populations, and others are spoken as second or other languages]].

=== Globalisation versus localisation ===

Whereas localisation is the process of adapting one product to a particular locale, globalisation designs the product to minimise the extra work required for each localisation.

Suppose that a company operating exclusively in [[Germany]] chooses to open a major office in [[Russia]] and needs a [[Standard Russian|Russian-language]] website. The company offers the same products and services in both countries with minor differences, but perhaps some elements that appeared in the original website intended for a German audience are offensive or upsetting in Russia (use of flags, colours, nationalistic images, songs, etc.). Thus, that company might lose a potential market because of small details of presentation.

Furthermore, this company might need to adapt the product to its new buyers; video games are the best example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.multilingual.com/articleDetail.php?id=1485|title=Practical skills for video game translators|last=Chandler|first=Heather Maxwell|date=October–November 2008|journal=MultiLingual|publisher=MultiLingual Computing|location=Sandpoint, Idaho}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.multilingual.com/articleDetail.php?id=1486 |title=Preserving the spell in games localization|journal=MultiLingual|date=October–November 2008|last=Crosignani|first=Simone|last2=Ballista|first2=Andrea|last3=Minazzi|first3=Fabio|publisher=MultiLingual Computing|location=Sandpoint, Idaho}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, suppose instead that this company has major offices in a dozen countries and needs a specifically designed website in each of these countries. Before deciding how to localise the website and the products offered in any given country, a professional in the area might advise the company to create an overall strategy: to globalise the way the organisation does business. The company might want to design a framework to codify and support this global strategy. The globalisation strategy and the globalisation framework would provide uniform guidance for the twelve separate localisation efforts.

Globalisation is especially important in mitigating extra work involved in the long-term cycle of localisation. Because localisation is a cycle and not a one-time project, there will always be new texts, updates, and projects to localise. For example, as the original website is updated over time, each of the localised websites already translated will also need to be updated. This cycle of work is continuous as long as the original project continues to evolve. It is therefore important for globalisation processes to be created and streamlined in order to implement ongoing changes. 

[[Translation memory]] (TM) technology that exists in various [[translation software]] platforms can aid in this specific aspect of the globalisation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Way to Translate a Website for Accuracy &amp; SEO|url=https://www.pairaphrase.com/best-way-translate-website-accuracy-seo/|website=Pairaphrase|publisher=Pairaphrase Blog|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language tags and codes ==

[[Language codes]] are closely related to the localising process because they indicate the locales involved in the translation and adaptation of the product. They are used in various contexts; for example, they might be informally used in a document published by the European Union&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-370200.htm|title=7.2.1. Order of language versions and ISO codes (multilingual texts)|work=Interinstitutional style guide|publisher=Europa Publications Office|date=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or they might be introduced in [[HTML element]] under the &lt;tt&gt;lang&lt;/tt&gt; attribute. In the case of the European Union style guide, the language codes are based on the [[ISO 639-1]] alpha-2 code; in HTML, the [[IETF language tag|language tags]] are generally defined within the Internet Engineering Task Force's ''[[Best Current Practice]]'' [https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47 (BCP) 47].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;''BCP'' is a persistent name for a series of IETF [[Request for Comments]] (RFCs) whose numbers change as they are updated. As of 2015-05-28, the latest included RFC about the principles of language tags is RFC 5646, ''Tags for the Identification of Languages''.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to use one type of code or tag versus another depends upon the nature of the project and any requirements set out for the localisation specialist.

Most frequently, there is a primary sub-code that identifies the language (e.g., "en"), and an optional sub-code in capital letters that specifies the national variety (e.g., "GB" or "US" according to [[ISO 3166-2]]). The sub-codes are typically linked with a hyphen, though in some contexts it's necessary to substitute this with an underscore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/libc/localedata/SUPPORTED?rev=1.102&amp;content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&amp;cvsroot=glibc|title=libc/localedata/SUPPORTED - view - 1.102|work=sources.redhat.com|publisher=Red Hat|date=18 February 2007|author=drepper|accessdate=6 September 2010}} (List of supported locales in the GNU &lt;tt&gt;libc&lt;/tt&gt; library.)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple language tag systems available for language codification. For example, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) specifies both two- and three-letter codes to represent languages in standards [[ISO 639-1]] and [[ISO 639-2]], respectively.

He also received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].&lt;!-- this should be relegated to somewhere below, perhaps the Category alone --&gt;

After the spring 2007 semester he retired to emeritus status at the [[UC Berkeley|University of California Berkeley]], where he received the Golden Apple Award for Outstanding Teaching that year. Then he went on a lecture tour that led to his latest book, ''How Free Is Free?: The Long Death of Jim Crow'' (2009).

==Biography==
Litwack was born in [[Santa Barbara, California]], in 1929, and received his B.A. in 1951 and Ph.D. in 1958 from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2005/09/14_litwack.shtml|title=Leon Litwack Rocks|publisher=The Berkeleyan and the UC Berkeley News Center|date=2005-09-14|author=Cathy Cockrell}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has taught at the [[University of Wisconsin]], [[University of South Carolina]], and [[Colorado College]].

Litwack's interest in history was sparked by ''The Growth of the American Republic'', by [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] and [[Henry Steele Commager]] (1930).  Litwack said, "The textbook was my first confrontation with history.  I asked my 11th grade teacher for the opportunity to respond to the textbook's version of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], to what I thought were distortions and racial biases. (I had already read [[Howard Fast]]'s ''Freedom Road''.) The research led me to the library—and to [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]'s ''Black Reconstruction'', with that intriguing subtitle: ''An Essay Toward a History of the Part which Black Folk Played in the Attempt to Reconstruct Democracy in America, 1860–1880.'' Armed with that book, I presented what I thought to be a persuasive rebuttal of the textbook."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5274 "Interview with Leon F. Litwack"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423214750/http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5274 |date=April 23, 2016 }}. Conducted by Roy Rosenzweig; completed January 2001.

Historian [[Michael Les Benedict]] wrote that in 1961 "Leon Litwack showed how the federal government's pervasive support for slavery led to shameful treatment of free [[African Americans]]." Benedict was referring to pages 30–63 of chapter 2, titled "The Federal Government and the Free Negro" in Litwack's book, ''North of Slavery: The Negro in the Free States, 1790-1860''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.msu.edu/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=73411015347997 "Don E.

In 1964-2007 Litwack taught at the [[University of California in Berkeley]], where he became the Alexander F. and May T. Morrison Professor of American History, instructing more than 30,000 students.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  For much of that time he taught the introductory course in post-Civil War American History.  He gave his final lecture as a professor, "Fight the Power", on Monday, May 7, 2007 in Wheeler Auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/04/30_litwack.shtml "Popular professor and esteemed historian to deliver last lecture"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722042618/http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/04/30_litwack.shtml |date=July 22, 2016 }}.

Litwack was elected to the presidency of the [[Organization of American Historians]]. An enormously popular and influential teacher, he was profiled in Newsweek's 2006 edition of the "Giving Back Awards", having been nominated by one of his former students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120908100109/http://www.newsweek.com/id/46166/page/3 Reader's Choice | Newsweek.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has received two distinguished teaching awards.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Litwack was presented with the Golden Apple Award for Outstanding Teaching in 2007 by the [[ASUC]] at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/03/21_litwack.shtml "Students adore retiring historian"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722042959/http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/03/21_litwack.shtml |date=July 22, 2016 }}.

With a ([[National Endowment for the Humanities]]) NEH Film Grant, he produced ''To Look for America'' in 1971.

''Been in the Storm So Long'' was a groundbreaking book on Reconstruction, published in 1979. It won the annual [[Pulitzer Prize for History]]&lt;ref name=pulitzer/&gt; and Francis Parkman Prize; next year its first paperback edition won a [[National Book Award]].&lt;ref name=nba1981/&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;
This was the 1981 [[List of winners of the National Book Award#History|award for paperback History]].
&lt;br&gt;From 1980 to 1983 in [[National Book Award#History|National Book Award history]] there were dual hardcover and paperback awards in most categories, and [[National Book Award for Nonfiction#nonfiction categories|several nonfiction subcategories]] including General Nonfiction. Most of the paperback award-winners were reprints, including this one.&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later he continued the investigation of race relations to the early 20th century with ''Trouble in Mind'' (1998). In turn, the sequel to ''Trouble''&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.oah.org/activities/lectureship/2006/lecturer.php?id=185 sequel].  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311044243/http://www.oah.org/activities/lectureship/2006/lecturer.php?id=185 |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is ''How Free Is Free?: The Long Death of Jim Crow (The Nathan I. Huggins Lectures)'', which focuses on black southerners and race relations from the 1930s to 1955.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">'''Ljubomir Kovačević''' (4 January 1848 – 19 November 1918) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] writer, historian, academic, and politician. He is one of the early creators of the Serbian critical historiographical school and fighters for the separation of historical science from tradition. Kovačević directly influenced the political and cultural activity of Serbia at the end of the nineteenth century. He and Ljubomir Jovanović were the authors of the well-known two-volume "Istorija srpskog naroda za srednje škole" (History of the Serbian People for the Secondary Schools) in the Kingdom of Serbia. Both Kovačević and Jovanović were Ministers of Education at one time and, as historians, using a wealth of verified information, professionally and convincingly refuted many myths that were passed down through the ages.

==Biography==
Kovačević was born in the village of [[Petnica]] in the [[Principality of Serbia]] on 4 January 1848. His father was Mihailo Kovačević, the Serbian Orthodox parish priest of Petnica, and his mother Vasilija was the daughter of professor [[Janićije Popović]]. Kovačević was educated at the Gymnasium of [[Šabac]] and the [[University of Belgrade|Belgrade Great School, Grandes écoles]]; he took his degree in 1870, afterwards was employed as lecturer at a college in [[Negotin]] and a year later he joined the staff of a teacher's college in [[Kragujevac]] before it was relocated to Belgrade. Later, he became a professor of history at his ''[[alma mater]]'' and rector of the [[University of Belgrade]] (former Great School). Kovačević chose to specialize in history because of his desire to be involved in the developing field of critical historiography.

Kovačević had five daughters and a son, Vladeta Kovačević (1882–1912), former student of the University of Paris. At the [[Battle of Kumanovo]], where he commanded the ''Mitrailleuses'' (machineguns), Vladeta was killed. His body was brought back to Belgrade. On the day of the funeral his mother and five sisters wept and groaned aloud. At the grave the old father without a tear made a moving speech:

{{quote|My son, depart in peace. You have done your duty. My son, I do not weep: I am proud of you. You have joined the heroes whose sufferings and death of old saved by millions the lives and souls of our nation. Tell the heroes of Kosovo, Dušan and Lazar and all the martyrs of former days, that today Kosovo is avenged.{{cite quote|date=April 2016}} }}

Kovačević fought in the [[Serbian–Ottoman War (1876–78)]]. He died at [[Vrnjačka Banja]] on 19 November 1918.

==Works==
In 1888 Ljubomir Kovačević wrote a treatise on "Vuk Branković, 1372–1398" while [[Ilarion Ruvarac]], coincidence would have it, wrote a treatise on "Prince Lazar" at the same time. Both of them, through a scholarly analysis of the sources and by applying existing principles of historiographic critique, omitted anything that was not verifiable by well-informed sources close to the event under study. In this manner, the story of the Battle of Kosovo was stripped of many picturesque details, the most important among them being the betrayal of Vuk Branković (Ćirković 1990: 115–116). These two scholars, independently of one another, came to the conclusion that Vuk Branković had not been a traitor in Kosovo, after all. A polemic soon arose between [[Panta Srećković]] and Russian Slavist Vladimir Vasiljević Kačanovski (1853–1901) who defended the thesis that historical truths should have other tasks besides purely scientific ones. In the end, Kovačević and Ruvarac succeeded to tear down the ruling school of Panta Srećković and Vladimir Kačanovski with the aid of [[Konstantin Jireček]] who also proved that Vuk Branković was not a traitor, and that Uroš died three months after King Vukašin, in December 1371, all thanks to the archives of Dubrovnik. These were but a few of the many myths that were put to rest, finally.
 
Kovačević also wrote ''Nekoliko Hronološki Popravka  U Srpskoj Istoriji'' (1880) among a score of other scholastic and academic works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1275">'''Mariano Armellino''' (1657&amp;ndash;1737) was a [[Benedictine]] historian, born in [[Rome]] (according to others, at [[Ancona]]).

At the age of twenty he entered the [[monastery]] of St. Paul in Rome, whence he was sent to [[Monte Cassino]] to complete his studies. From 1687 to 1695 he taught philosophy at various monasteries of the [[Cassinese Congregation]]. From 1697 to 1722 he devoted himself to [[preach]]ing and became famous throughout Italy for his [[Lent]]en [[sermon]]s. In 1722 [[Pope Innocent XIII]] appointed him [[abbot]] of the monastery at [[Siena]]; in 1729 he was transferred as abbot to the Monastery of St. Peter at [[Assisi]], and in 1734, to the Monastery at St. Felician, near Foligno.

He wrote the ''Bibliotheca Benedictino-Casinensis'', a list and sketch of the authors of the Cassinese Congregation, and a few other [[history|historical]] and [[hagiography|hagiographical]] works concerning the Cassinese Congregation of Benedictines.

He died at [[Foligno]].

'''Nicomedia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|ɪ|k|ə|ˈ|m|iː|d|i|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/Nicomedia "Nicomedia" in the American Heritage Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-el|Νικομήδεια}}, ''Nikomedeia''; modern '''[[İzmit]]''') was an [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city in what is now [[Turkey]]. 

In 286 Nicomedia became the eastern and most senior capital city of the [[Roman Empire]] (chosen by [[Diocletian]] who assumed the title ''Augustus of the East''), a status which the city maintained during the [[Tetrarchy]] system (293–324). The Tetrarchy ended with the [[Battle of Chrysopolis]] ([[Üsküdar#Chrysopolis|Üsküdar]]) in 324, when [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] defeated [[Licinius]] and became the sole emperor. In 330 Constantine chose for himself the nearby [[Byzantium]] (which was renamed [[Constantinople]], modern [[Istanbul]]) as the new capital of the Roman Empire.

==History==
It was founded in 712/11 BC as a [[Megarian]] colony and was originally known as '''[[Astacus in Bithynia|Astacus]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|s|t|ə|k|ə|s}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Ἀστακός, "lobster").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Guide to Greece By Pausanias|editor=Peter Levi |page=232 |isbn=0-14-044225-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being destroyed by [[Lysimachus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hellenistic settlements in Europe, the islands, and Asia Minor |first=Getzel M.|last= Cohen |page=400 |isbn=0-520-08329-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was rebuilt by [[Nicomedes I of Bithynia]] in 264 BC under the name of Nicomedia, and has ever since been one of the most important cities in northwestern [[Asia Minor]]. The great military commander [[Hannibal|Hannibal Barca]] came to Nicomedia in his final years and committed suicide in nearby Libyssa ([[Diliskelesi]], [[Gebze]]). The historian [[Arrian]] was born there.

Nicomedia was the [[metropolis]] and capital of the Roman province of [[Bithynia]] under the [[Roman Empire]]. It is referenced repeatedly in [[Pliny the Younger]]'s [[Epistulae (Pliny)|Epistles]] to Trajan during his tenure as governor of Bithynia.&lt;ref name="W.L. MacDonald 1976"&gt;{{cite article| url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0006:entry=nicomedia| title=NICOMEDIA NW Turkey| author=W.L. MacDonald| work=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diocletian]] made it the eastern capital city of the Roman Empire in 286 when he introduced the [[Tetrarchy]] system.

===Persecutions of 303===
Nicomedia was at the center of the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] of Christians which occurred under Diocletian and his [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] [[Galerius]]. On 23 February 303 AD, the pagan festival of the [[Terminalia]], Diocletian ordered that the newly-built church at Nicomedia be razed, its scriptures burnt, and its precious stones seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Constantine &amp; Eusebius| author=Timothy D. Barnes| date=1981| p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day he issued his "First Edict Against the Christians," which ordered similar measures to be taken at churches across the Empire.

The destruction of the Nicomedia church incited panic in the city, and at the end of the month a fire destroyed part of Diocletian's palace, followed 16 days later by another fire.&lt;ref name="Patricia Southern 2001"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Roman Empire: From Severus to Constantine| author=Patricia Southern| year=2001| p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an investigation was made into the cause of the fires, no party was officially charged, but Galerius placed the blame on the Christians. He oversaw the execution of two palace [[eunuchs]], who he claimed conspired with the Christians to start the fire, followed by six more executions through the end of April 303. Soon after Galerius declared Nicomedia to be unsafe and ostentatiously departed the city for Rome, followed soon after by Diocletian.&lt;ref name="Patricia Southern 2001"/&gt;

===Later Empire===
[[File:Tetrarchy map3.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Roman Empire]] during the [[Tetrarchy]] system, showing the dioceses and the four tetrarchs' zones of influence. Nicomedia was the eastern and most senior capital city, chosen by [[Diocletian]] who assumed the title ''Augustus of the East''.]]

Nicomedia remained as the eastern (and most senior) capital of the Roman Empire until co-emperor [[Licinius]] was defeated by [[Constantine the Great]] at the [[Battle of Chrysopolis]] ([[Üsküdar]]) in 324. Constantine mainly resided in Nicomedia as his interim capital city for the next six years, until in 330 he declared the nearby [[Byzantium]] (which was renamed [[Constantinople]]) the new capital. Constantine died in a royal villa in the vicinity of Nicomedia in 337. Owing to its position at the convergence of the Asiatic roads leading to the new capital, Nicomedia retained its importance even after the foundation of Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;See C. Texier, ''Asie mineure'' (Paris, 1839); V. Cuenet, ''Turquie d'Asie'' (Paris, 1894).&lt;/ref&gt;

A major [[Cecropius of Nicomedia#Earthquake of Nicomedia|earthquake]], however, on 24 August 358, caused extensive devastation to Nicomedia, and was followed by a fire which completed the catastrophe. Nicomedia was rebuilt, but on a smaller scale.&lt;ref&gt;See Ammianus Marcellinus 17.7.1–8&lt;/ref&gt; In the sixth century under Emperor [[Justinian I]] the city was extended with new public buildings. Situated on the roads leading to the capital, the city remained a major military center, playing an important role in the Byzantine campaigns against the [[Caliphate]].&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;{{citation | editor-first = Alexander | editor-last = Kazhdan | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | pages=1483–1484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 451, the local bishopric was promoted to a [[Metropolis of Nicomedia|Metropolitan see]] under the jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kiminas|first=Demetrius|title=The Ecumenical Patriarchate|year=2009|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=978-1-4344-5876-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLWqXrW2X-8C&amp;pg=PA81|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metropolis of Nicomedia was ranked 7th in the ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' among the metropolises of the patriarchate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Terezakis|first=Yorgos|title=Diocese of Nicomedia (Ottoman Period)|url=http://www.ehw.gr/l.aspx?id=8729|publisher=Εγκυκλοπαίδεια Μείζονος Ελληνισμού, Μ. Ασία|accessdate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighth century the Emperor [[Constantine V]] established his court there for a time, when plague broke out in Constantinople and drove him from his capital in 746–47.&lt;ref&gt;David Turner, The Politics of Despair: The Plague of 746–747 and Iconoclasm in the Byzantine Empire, The Annual of the British School at Athens, Vol. 85 (1990), p428&lt;/ref&gt; From the 840s on, Nicomedia was the capital of the ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|thema]]'' of the ''[[Optimatoi]]''. By that time, most of the old, seawards city had been abandoned and is described by the Persian geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh|Ibn Khurdadhbih]] as lying in ruins, with settlement restricted to the hilltop citadel.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt; In the 1080s, the city served as the main military base for [[Alexios I Komnenos]] in his campaigns against the [[Seljuk Turks]], and the [[First Crusade|First]] and [[Second Crusade|Second]] Crusades both encamped there.

The city was briefly held by the [[Latin Empire]] following the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204: in late 1206 the [[seneschal]] [[Thierry de Loos]] made it his base, converting the church of Saint Sophia into a fortress; however, the Crusader stronghold was subjected to constant raids by the [[Emperor of Nicaea]] [[Theodore I Laskaris]], during which de Loos was captured by Nicaean soldiers; by the summer of 1207 Emperor [[Henry of Flanders]] agreed to evacuate Nicomedia in exchange for de Loos and other prisoners Emperor Theodore held.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey de Villehardouin]], translated by M. R. B. Shaw, ''Joinville and Villehardouin: Chronicles of the Crusades'' (London: Penguin, 1963), pp. 147, 154–56&lt;/ref&gt; The city remained in Byzantine control for over a century after that, but following the Byzantine defeat at the [[Battle of Bapheus]] in 1302, it was threatened by the rising [[Ottoman beylik]]. The city was twice blockaded by the Ottomans (in 1304 and 1330) before finally succumbing in 1337.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;

==Infrastructure==
During the Empire, Nicomedia was a cosmopolitan and commercially prosperous city which received all the amenities appropriate for a major Roman city. Nicomedia was well known for having a bountiful water supply from two to three aqueducts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oratories| author=Libanius| p=61.7.18}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which was built in [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] times. [[Pliny the Younger]] complains in his ''[[Epistulae (Pliny)|epistulae]]'' to [[Trajan]], written in 110 AD, that the Nicomedians wasted 3,518,000 [[sesterces]] on an unfinished aqueduct which twice ran into engineering troubles. Trajan instructs him to take steps to complete the aqueduct, and to investigate possible official corruption behind the large waste of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Epistulae| author=Pliny the Younger| p=10.37 &amp; .38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Trajan, there was also a large Roman garrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Epistles| author=Pliny the Younger| p=10.74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other public amenities included a theatre, a colonnaded street typical of Hellenistic cities and a forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Epistles| author=Pliny the Younger| p=10.49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major religious shrine was a temple of [[Demeter]], which stood in a sacred precinct on a hill above the harbor.&lt;ref name="W.L. MacDonald 1976"/&gt; The city adopted official cults of Rome avidly, there were temples dedicated to the Emperor [[Commodus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Roman History| author=Dio Cassius| p=73.12.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sacred precinct of the city dedicated to [[Octavian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Roman History| author=Cassius Dio| p=51.20.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a temple of [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]] dedicated during the late-Republic.&lt;ref name="W.L. MacDonald 1976"/&gt;

The city was sacked in AD 253 by the [[Goths]], but when Diocletian made the city his capital in 283 AD he undertook grand restorations and built an enormous palace, an armory, mint and new shipyards.&lt;ref name="W.L. MacDonald 1976"/&gt;

==Remains==
[[File:Nicomedia Aqueduct, Izmit, Turkey (39171950052).jpg|thumb| Ruins of a Nicomedian aqueduct in Izmit]]
The ruins of Nicomedia are buried beneath the densely populated modern city of [[Izmit]], which has largely obstructed comprehensive excavation. Before the urbanization of the 20th century occurred, select ruins of the Roman-era city could be seen, most prominently sections of the Roman defensive walls which surrounded the city and multiple aqueducts which once supplied Nicomedia's water. Other monuments include the foundations of a 2nd-century AD marble [[nymphaeum]] on Istanbul street, a large cistern in the city's Jewish cemetery, and parts of the harbor wall.&lt;ref name="W.L. MacDonald 1976"/&gt;

The [[1999 İzmit earthquake]], which seriously damaged most of the city, also led to major discoveries of ancient Nicomedia during the subsequent debris clearing. A wealth of ancient statuary was uncovered, including statues of [[Hercules]], [[Athena]], Diocletian and Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/ancient-underground-city-in-izmit-excites-archaeology-world--96000| title=Ancient underground city in izmit excites archaeology world| publisher=Hürriyet Daily News| date=2016-03-04| access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after the earthquake, the Izmit Provincial Cultural Directorate appropriated small areas for excavation, including the site identified as Diocletian's Palace and a nearby Roman theatre. In April 2016 a more extensive excavation of the palace was begun under the supervision of the [[Kocaeli Museum]], which estimated that the site covers 60,000 square meters (196,850 square feet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/ancient-underground-city-in-izmit-excites-archaeology-world--96000| title=Ancient underground city in izmit excites archaeology world| publisher=Hürriyet Daily News| date=2016-03-04| access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3942">'''Patrick Corish''' (1921 - 2013) was a priest of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ferns|Diocese of Ferns]], born in Ballycullane parish in [[County Wexford]]. He is best known as a distinguished Irish historian and a President of [[St Patrick's College, Maynooth|St. Patrick's College, Maynooth]]. For many years, he was Professor of Ecclesiastical History in Saint Patrick's College Maynooth, in succession to the late Cardinal [[Tomás Ó Fiaich]].

Although he published many academic articles and was in demand as a reviewer he is best known for two books: ''The Irish Catholic Experience''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Irish Catholic Experience: A Historical Survey|publisher = Michael Glazier|date = 1985-12-01|isbn = 9780894535345|language = English|first = Patrick J.|last = Corish}}&lt;/ref&gt;(1985), a one volume history of Catholicism in Ireland, and ''Maynooth College 1795-1995''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Maynooth College 1795-1995|publisher = Gill &amp; Macmillan Ltd|date = 1994-11-30|isbn = 9780717122417|language = English|first = Patrick J.|last = Corish}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1995), published for the bi-centenary of Maynooth College.  In addition, he was editor of the sources journal [[Archivium Hibernicum]].

He had an extraordinarily long association with Maynooth College which started in 1939 when he arrived to commence his studies for the priesthood.  He was ordained in the College Chapel on 17 June 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Obituaries - Diocese of Ferns|url = http://ferns.ie/obituaries/|website = ferns.ie|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; received a Doctorate in Theology and was appointed Professor of Ecclesiastical History in Saint Patrick’s College, Maynooth in 1947.  Twenty years later, in 1967, he was made College President but served only one year before resuming his duties as Professor of Ecclesiastical History. He was succeeded as President by [[Jeremiah Newman]].

In his retirement, he took great delight in developing the rock garden which was part of the original walled garden in the College. In 1984 he joined the Alpine Garden Society and raised many plants from seed in the quarter acre garden.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alpinegardensociety.ie/sources/AGS%20Newsletter%2050%20Summer%202008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 2013 and is buried in the College cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CORISH Monsignor Patrick J. : Death|url = http://www.announcement.ie/death/corish-monsignor-patrick-j/23047691|website = www.announcement.ie|access-date = 2016-02-07|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; One obituary referred to Monsignor Paddy having "a sense of innocent mischief, or as some might say wicked cynicism fuelled at times with dark forebodings." While in his homily at the Requiem Mass, Bishop [[Denis Brennan]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ferns|Diocese of Ferns]] spoke of how Monsignor Corish "had developed an impish, good-humoured line in pessimism." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Homily of Bishop Brennan for the Funeral Mass of Msgr Patrick J Corish, former President of Saint Patrick’s College, Maynooth|url = http://www.catholicbishops.ie/2013/01/15/homily-bishop-brennan-funeral-mass-msgr-patrick-corish-president-saint-patricks-college-maynooth/|website = Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Since his death, an annual Monsignor Patrick J Corish Lecture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Annual Monsignor Patrick J Corish Lecture 2014|url = http://maynoothcollege.ie/pontifical-university/2014/08/06/the-annual-monsignor-patrick-j-corish-lecture-2014/|website = maynoothcollege.ie|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been held by Maynooth College in his memory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5940">{{short description|late-16th-century English playing company}}
'''The Earl of Pembroke's Men''' was an [[Elizabethan era]] [[playing company]], or troupe of actors, in [[English Renaissance theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Kerchever Chambers|E. K. Chambers]], ''The Elizabethan Stage,'' 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 2, pp. 128-34.&lt;/ref&gt; They functioned under the patronage of [[Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]]. Early and equivocal mentions of a Pembroke's company reach as far back as 1575; but the company is known for certain to have been in existence in 1592. In that year, a share in the company was valued at £80 (more than [[William Shakespeare]] would pay for New Place in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] five years later).&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew John Gurr|Andrew Gurr]] with [[John Orrell]], ''Rebuilding Shakespeare's Globe,'' New York, Routledge, 1989; p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shakespeare==
Some think that Shakespeare spent time as both an actor and writer for Pembroke's Men in the early 1590s. Two of the earliest [[book size|quarto]] publications of individual Shakespearean plays are both linked to this company: the title page of the earliest text of ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'' (1595) states that the play was performed by Pembroke's Men, while the title page of Q1 of ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' (1594) states that that play was acted by three companies, Pembroke's Men, [[Lord Strange's Men|Derby's Men]], and [[Sussex's Men]]. The mention of three acting companies for one play is unusual; but the early 1590s were difficult years for the professional actors of the day. Severe epidemics of [[bubonic plague]] forced a halt to public performances in and around London; the actors' troupes toured the provinces, splintered and recombined, and generally did whatever was necessary to continue.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564&amp;ndash;1964,'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 361-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difficult years==
The company that toured under Pembroke's patronage in 1592 is generally considered to have been formed by personnel from [[Lord Strange's Men]] and the Lord [[Admiral's Men]], two companies that had been working together at [[Philip Henslowe]]'s [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose]] Theatre in 1591. The tour lasted about ten months and was a financial failure. Their tour of 1593 featured ''3 Henry VI;'' other plays in their repertory at the time were [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'', and ''[[The Taming of the Shrew#Authorship and The Taming of a Shrew|The Taming of a Shrew]]'' (a different version of the Shakespeare play known today). The 1593 tour was also a disappointment; a letter that Henslowe wrote to [[Edward Alleyn]] in September 1593 states that Pembroke's Men had been home from their tour for five of six weeks, and had had to pawn their costumes. The company's members struggled through, however; they were touring the provinces again in 1595 and 1596.

==''The Isle of Dogs''==
Pembroke's Men achieved their one great peak of fame, notoriety, infamy in 1597. In February of that year they signed an exclusive contract with [[Francis Langley]], to perform at his new [[The Swan (theatre)|Swan Theatre]]. Their standing roster was augmented by two actors from the Admiral's Men, Thomas Downton and Richard Jones. Their season began in the spring and early summer without incident, as far as is known; but in July 1597 they performed [[The Isle of Dogs (play)|''The Isle of Dogs'']], by [[Thomas Nashe]] and [[Ben Jonson]]. Something in this lost play (no copy survived its suppression) offended the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]; in response to its "very seditious and scandalous matter," the Council ordered all the public theatres closed for the rest of the summer. Ben Jonson and two of the actors in the cast, Robert Shaw and [[Gabriel Spencer]], were thrown into the [[Marshalsea]] prison till October 3; Thomas Nashe escaped only by fleeing to Great Yarmouth in Norfolk (not, as this is often confused, Yarmouth, which is on the Isle of Wight). The documents relating to the case specify that Jonson was not only a part-author of the play, but also a member of the cast &amp;mdash; one of the few indications of Jonson's early career on the boards.

The other theatre companies in London were allowed to resume activity after the summer was over; but the Privy Council decided to punish Langley in particular (he was in trouble for additional, non-theatre-related causes), and kept the Swan closed. (Langley may have staged occasional performances despite the ban; but he was unable to resume regular performances, which would have provided a regular income for all concerned.) This presented the Pembroke's Men with a critical problem: they were legally bound to act only for Langley &amp;mdash; but couldn't act for Langley. The company broke apart under the strain: Jones and Downton returned to the Admiral's, and three more Pembroke men, William Borne and the recently released Shaw and Spencer, followed them. (Spencer would be killed by Jonson in their famous duel a year later.) They appear to have taken some Pembroke's playscripts with them, titles that may have included a ''Dido and Aeneas'', plus ''Hardicanute, Black Joan, Friar Spendleton, Alice Pierce,'' and others.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Langley sued over this breach of contract; but apparently he reached some kind of agreement with Henslowe, since the five actors stayed with Henslowe's company. The rump of Pembroke's Men, perhaps augmented with replacement recruits, toured the provinces from late 1597 through 1599. After two unsuccessful performances at the Rose Theatre in October 1600, the company disappears from history; some of its members may have joined [[Worcester's Men]], a company that was re-forming at the time. Langley himself died a year after the company, in 1601.

'''Philippe Louis Henri Marie de Chérisey''', 9th [[marquess]] de Chérisey (13 February 1923&amp;nbsp;– 17 July 1985) was a [[France|French]] writer, radio [[humorist]], [[Surrealism|surrealist]] and [[supporting actor]] (using the [[stage name]] '''Amédée''').

He is best known for his [[forgery|creation of fake parchments]] published in the 1967 book ''L'Or de Rennes'' by [[Gérard de Sède]], as part of his involvement in the [[Priory of Sion]] hoax between 1962-1983.

==Early life==
Coming from a wealthy family in the [[Lorraine (région)|Lorraine]], de Chérisey decided to become an actor against his family's wishes. He enrolled in the [[René Simon]] drama school in 1946 where he started his actor's training,&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Jarnac, ''Les Archives de Rennes-le-Château'', page 524 (Tome 2, Editions Bélisane: Nice, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; and his most notable film appearance was in ''[[Forbidden Games|Jeux interdits]]'' in 1952. He was known as a bon viveur, regularly enjoyed wine and frequented public libraries where his natural curiosity made him follow up anything that took his fancy.

==Surrealism==
Philippe de Chérisey was a follower of the [[surrealist]] movement, who claimed acquaintance with [[Eugene Ionesco]] and was like him a member of the [[College of Pataphysics]], although - like his membership of [[Oulipo]] - there is no evidence that he was actively involved. His desire to subvert the norms of culture, or in other words, create an alternate reality that became more real than reality itself, was done within the context of the Priory of Sion and to promote the claim that Pierre Plantard was the direct descendant of [[Dagobert II]].  He considered himself a satirist from his days in French radio, and continued this persona within the theme of the Priory of Sion calling himself a prankster. The best known example of this is his esoteric novella ''Circuit'' (originally written in 1968, but not actually deposited within the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] until 1971).

==Rennes-le-Château==
By the early 1960s Philippe de Chérisey met [[Pierre Plantard]], and together they developed an interest in [[Rennes-le-Château]]. From the mid-1950s local hotelier [[Noël Corbu]] circulated a story to boost trade, that the 19th century priest [[Bérenger Saunière]] of Rennes-le-Château had discovered the treasure of [[Blanche of Castile]]. The author [[Robert Charroux]] published Corbu's story in his 1962 book ''Trésors du Monde''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Charroux, ''Trésors du monde: enterrés, emmurés, engloutis'' (Paris: Fayard, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter dated 2 April 1965 to his girlfriend, de Chérisey wrote: "Don't tell anyone, but I'll be setting out again for four days in the Pyrenees with Plantard to see if we can get any closer to Mary Magdalene."&lt;ref&gt;''L'ABC de RLC – l'Encyclopédie de Rennes-le-Château'', pages 97-98 (Marseille: Éditions Arqa, 2009). {{ISBN|2-7551-0031-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mixture of de Chérisey's humor and surrealism can be identified within his activities relating to the Priory of Sion hoax, Gisors and Rennes-le-Château, contained in his correspondence as well as in his documents that he deposited in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris.

===Parchments===
During the early 1960s, de Chérisey forged two parchments, photocopies of which appeared in the 1967 book ''L'Or de Rennes'' by Gérard de Sède.&lt;ref&gt;Gérard de Sède, ''L'Or de Rennes ou la Vie insolite de Bérenger Saunière, curé de Rennes-le-Château'' (Paris: René Julliard, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; De Sède's book adapted Corbu's story to fit-in with Plantard's claims about the Priory of Sion. The parchments hinted at the survival of the line of the Frankish king [[Dagobert II]], that  Plantard claimed to be descended from, as well as attempting to verify the existence of the 1000-year-old secret society, the Priory of Sion. The two "parchments" were later used as source material for the 1982 book ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'', which was itself used as a primary source for the 2003 bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''. Other documents, containing fake genealogies, were planted in the French National Library, the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

Pierre Plantard and Gérard de Sède fell out over book royalties when ''L'Or de Rennes'' was published in 1967, at the same time Philippe de Chérisey announced that he had forged the "parchments". De Chérisey elaborated about this in his 1978 unpublished document ''L'Énigme de Rennes'', claiming they were originally made for his friend Francis Blanche, as material for a French radio serial entitled ''Signé Furax''.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe de Chérisey, ''L'Énigme de Rennes''. Bibliothèque Nationale, EL 4- Z PIECE- 110. Dépôt Légal, 6 June 1978&lt;/ref&gt; A second document by de Chérisey entitled ''Pierre et papier'' ("Stone and Paper") provides a more detailed explanation, giving the more complicated decoding technique to one of the "parchments" by using a [[Knight's Tour]] 25-letter alphabet, omitting the letter "w", the knowledge of which can only be known to the forger.&lt;ref&gt;Quoting Philippe de Chérisey from ''Stone and Paper'': "my grid decipherment has only 25 letters whereas the French alphabet has 26 – I have left out W. Was I cheating? No, not at all, as I drew up Documents I and II in semi-uncial handwriting to give the impression that they dated from an historical period when the letter W was unknown to the Western world as U and V were used instead." Pierre Plantard published a correct Knight's Tour decoding technique in ''Vaincre'' Number 3, page 19 (September 1989), showing he held the right information.&lt;/ref&gt; An English translation of this document, together with a reproduction of the original, was published by Jean-Luc Chaumeil in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Luc Chaumeil, ''The Priory of Sion: Shedding Light on the Treasure and Legacy of Rennes-le-Château and the Priory of Sion'' (Avalonia, 2010). {{ISBN|1-905297-41-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Details of the forgeries===
The text of one "parchment" (parchment 1) was copied from ''[[Codex Bezae]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090107060716/http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/Rennes/ Originally identified by Wieland Willker]&lt;/ref&gt; an Old Latin/Greek diglot from the 5th century CE contained in the book by [[Fulcran Grégoire Vigouroux]], ''Dictionnaire De La Bible'' (1895).&lt;ref&gt;Fulcran Vigouroux, ''Dictionnaire de la Bible, contenant tous les noms de personnes, de lieux, de plantes, d'animaux mentionnés dans les Saintes Écritures, les questions théologiques, archéologiques, scientifiques, critiques, relatives à l'Ancien et au Nouveau Testament'', Tome Premier 1895 (Paris: Letouzey et Ané, 1895-1912)&lt;/ref&gt; Philippe de Chérisey's reason for copying the passage from the Codex Bezae was his interest in the phrase "In Sabbato Secundo Primo", also found in the [[Gospel of Luke]] 6:1. Philippe de Chérisey stated: "This phrase has given headaches to the anonymous (secret) societies. It has to be said that 'A day of Sabbath, second first' is not really translatable. No one has ever heard of that. So, as the disciples walk through a cornfield and, being hungry, eat the corn, there and then, it must mean 'Second Sabbath following the first day of the shewbread.' This is the only interpretation we could find." De Chérisey went on to provide his own interpretation: "In Sabbato Secundo Primo does not mean 'A day of Sabbath, second first' but rather 'As second in command, Sabassius became first.' What is interesting is that the witches' meetings are called 'Sabbaths', not because of the Jewish celebrations, but because of Sabassius, god of the Phrygians".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Luc Chaumeil, ''The Priory of Sion - Shedding Light on the Treasure and Legacy of Rennes-le-Château and the Priory of Sion'', pages 149-150 (Avalonia, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

This "parchment" also contained an encrypted message written in modern French: "''À Dagobert II Roi et à Sion est ce trésor et il est là mort.''" (translated as "To King Dagobert II and to Sion does this treasure belong, and he is there, dead").

De Chérisey also chose to copy material from Vigouroux because he was a priest connected with the [[Saint-Sulpice (Paris)|Church of St Sulpice]], a location that had been exploited as part of the Priory of Sion myths as created by Plantard and de Chérisey, so de Chérisey's utilisation of this priest fitted in nicely into these myths.

According to an investigation into the [[Priory of Sion]] hoax by the American news program [[60 Minutes]], the other document (parchment 2) was copied from a 19th-century version of the Latin [[Vulgate]] published by John Wordsworth and Henry J. White ''Novum Testamentum Domini Nostri Iesu Christi latine secundum sancti Hieronymi'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1889–1954),&lt;ref&gt;Bill Putnam, John Edwin Wood. ''The Treasure of Rennes-le-Chateau, A Mystery Solved'' (Sutton Publishing Limited, Gloucestershire GL5 2BU, England, 2003.)&lt;/ref&gt; and the original forged "parchments" are now in the possession of Jean-Luc Chaumeil, a French writer, who states that he had their age analyzed, and it was confirmed that they were merely decades old, not centuries.  Chaumeil also has letters by de Chérisey, which contain proof that De Chérisey was knowingly engaging in a fraud.

That Philippe de Chérisey was not a specialist of Latin paleography and had even a bit lost his Latin knowledge (got from high school) is demonstrated in his copying of the Latin Text from the Codex Bezae for one of his "parchments": for instance, he made several of the most basic errors in copying the Latin [[uncial]]s, which therefore garbles the spelling of multiple words.  This information is frequently omitted by those who present the "parchments" as being authentic.

In an interview during the 1970s with author Jean-Luc Chaumeil, Philippe de Chérisey asserted: "the parchments of the Gospel according to Saint Luke fabricated by me and for which I pinched the uncial text from the work ''L'archéologie chrétienne'' (''Christian Archaeology'') by Dom Cabrol at the National Library, section C25".&lt;ref&gt;Published in Jean-Luc Chaumeil, ''Le Trésor du Triangle d'Or'', page 80 (Nice: Alain Lefeuvre, 1979). Translation given in Chaumeil, ''The Priory of Sion'', page 148 (Avalonia, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippe de Chérisey asserted in a letter dated 29 January 1974 to French author Pierre Jarnac: "P.S. Do you know that the famous manuscripts supposedly discovered by the [[Berenger Sauniere|Abbé Saunière]] were composed in 1965? And that I took responsibility for being the author?"&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Jarnac, ''Histoire du Trésor de Rennes-le-Château'', page 268 (L’Association pour le développement de la lecture, 1985; reprinted by Editions Bélisane: Nice, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Henry Lincoln]], one of the co-authors of [[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail|''Holy Blood Holy Grail'']], Plantard admitted to him in person that the various documents had been forged, and identified de Chérisey as their creator.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Lincoln, ''The Key To The Sacred Pattern'' (The Windrush Press, Moreton-in-Marsh, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Plantard===
A schism developed between Pierre Plantard and Philippe de Chérisey in 1983, when de Chérisey began collaborating with Paul Rouelle (his dentist) on a book which would have incorporated the Priory of Sion concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rouelle, ''Court-circuit, avec un feu d'artifices de Philippe de Chérisey'' (written in 1983). Published in 2010 with a preface by Henry Lincoln (Paris: ODS). {{ISBN|2-914405-64-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French author Pierre Jarnac reproduced part of a letter he received dated 22 May 1985 from Pierre Plantard: "You need to know only that I have no involvement whatsoever with the 'deathless prose' of Monsieur Philippe de Chérisey, who was the co-author with Monsieur Paul Rouelle of the book COURT-CIRCUIT, lodged with the BN in December 1984 or January 1985, which dragged my name through the mud. The Marquis de Chérisey was a good friend of mine from university days, but I very often disapprove of his books which are really quite bizarre."&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Jarnac, ''Les Archives de Rennes-le-Château'', page 550 (Tome 2, Editions Bélisane: Nice, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Philippe de Chérisey died in [[Paris]] on 17 July 1985, while working to finish an encyclopedia of trema.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite web |url=http://www.societe-perillos.com/cherisey_aa.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018174117/http://www.societe-perillos.com/cherisey_aa.html |archivedate=2014-10-18 |df= }} and {{cite web |url=http://www.societe-perillos.com/aa_review.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019100227/http://www.societe-perillos.com/aa_review.html |archivedate=2014-10-19 |df= }} about the first part published in 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral was held at the [[Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris|Church of the Holy Trinity]] in Paris and he was buried in the [[Burial vault (tomb)|family vault]] at [[Rœux]] (Pas-de-Calais).&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Jarnac, ''Les Archives de Rennes-le-Château'', page 525 (Tome 2, Editions Bélisane: Nice, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

His death was announced by Gino Sandri in number 10 of ''Etudes Mérovingiennes'' (August 1985), the journal of the association ''Cercle Saint Dagobert II''.

{{distinguish|Police brutality}}
'''Policide''' is a [[neologism]] used in [[political science]] to describe the intentional destruction of an independent political and social entity, such as a city or nation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] in its entry for ''[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/265482 politicide]'' notes the first usage as: 1968 Y. HARKABI Fedayeen Action &amp; Arab Strategy 11/2 The Arabs' objective of destroying the state of Israel (what may be called a 'politicide') drives them to genocide.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used with some regularity within political science, generally to refer to a policy of destruction that falls short of [[genocide]] or [[ethnocide]].

==Origin==
Writer [[Michael Walzer]] credits the origin of the term "policide" (here, meaning the "destruction of a state's independence") to [[Abba Eban]], [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Israel's foreign minister]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=Walzer&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, professor Steve J. Stern has adopted "policide" to mean the destruction of political life itself.  Stern describes the term as an extension of a family of terms including ''[[homicide]]'', ''[[patricide]]'', ''[[tyrannicide]]'', ''[[genocide]]'', ''[[democide]]'', and ''[[ethnocide]]''.  Stern uses the term "policide," rooted in the Greek term ''[[polis]]'' (πόλις) for "city-state" or "body politic," in order to describe what he characterizes as "a systematic project to destroy an entire way of doing and understanding politics and governance" in [[Chile under Pinochet|Chile]] under the governance of [[Augusto Pinochet]].&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;{{cite book

* The term "policide" frequently arises with respect to the intention to eradicate the state of [[Israel]].  [[Yossi Beilin]] discusses Current Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s use of the term to describe the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]]'s claim that it is dedicated to the ultimate destruction of the State of Israel.&lt;ref name=Beilin&gt;{{cite book

* 1975 Irving Spiegel New York Times (Oct. 20) "Criticism in U.S." p. 6: Rabbi Alexand M.

This he believed has been present throughout Israel's confrontations with the Palestinians, but was epitomised by the thoughts and actions of [[Ariel Sharon]].&lt;ref&gt;Baruch Kimmerling ''Politicide: Ariel Sharon's War Against the Palestinians '' defines politicide as "the dissolution of the Palestinian people's existence as a legitimate social, political and economic entity."

'''Rajlich's hypothesis''' is a physical [[hypothesis]] with a significance for geology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Český kráter|last=1944-|first=Rajlich, Petr|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Jihočeské muzeum|isbn=9788086260808|oclc=276814811}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vesmírná příhoda v Českém křemeni (a v Českém masivu)|last=1944-.|first=Rajlich, Petr|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Geologie|isbn=9788026056782|oclc=883371161}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exist macroscopic white lamellae inside [[quartz]] and other [[mineral]]s in the [[Bohemian Massif]] and even at another places in whole of the world like wavefronts generated by a [[Impact event|meteorite impact]] according to the hypothesis. The hypothetical wavefronts are composed of many microcavities. Their origin is seen in a physical phenomenon of [[Cavitation|ultrasonic cavitation]], which is well known from the technical practice.

The cavities are usually made inside liquids, not in solid state media. The meteorite hit should fluidize the minerals, and mechanical waves of high frequency should tear them.

Based on the technical practice it is known that a cavity implosion inside liquid generates high temperatures of thousands of kelvins and even a shock wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suslick|first=Kenneth S.|title=The Chemical Effects of Ultrasound|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-chemical-effects-of-ultrasound/|journal=Scientific American|language=en|volume=260|issue=2|pages=80–86|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0289-80|bibcode=1989SciAm.260b..80S|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are found many intersecting systems of white lamellae inside quartz at many localities from the Bohemian Massif. It can be assumed that according to high number of wavefronts transferred through the minerals and resulting high number of cavity implosions, the structure of quartz was partially disrupted during the fluidization and the distribution of prevailing pressure was respected during the transfer into a solid state.{{clarify|It is completely unclear what the verb "respected" means in this context|date=June 2018}} There could be then preferred a creation of denser quartz in the area of higher pressure.{{clarify|This sentence does not make grammatical sense|date=June 2018}} This means a creation of smaller basic molecular Si-O rings. The situation in the area of lower pressure could be opposite. A finding of such harmonic signature of the quartz density is considered to be an option for the hypothesis verification.{{clarify|what does option mean? A possible verfication? Even that does not make much sense|date=June 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mestan|first=J.|last2=Alvarez Polanco|first2=E.

The author of the hypothesis is a Czech geologist [[Petr Rajlich]]. It is connected with the [[Czech Crater]] hypothesis.

== Interesting facts ==
The shapes of the microcavities are between spheres and negative crystals.

There is seen a probable erasure of older sets of lamellae by new sets in quartz with hypothetical cavitation lamellae, which is presented by Rajlich in few samples.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A similar distribution is common in quartz with conventional PDF lamellae. Their presence is a today's recognized criterion for a verification of impact structures.
[[File:Quartz-zhaseni.gif|thumb|Undulose extinction of fractured quartz affected by plastic deformation.]]
The cavitation lamellae sometimes seem like small teeth or pillars,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which is a well known effect from today's verified impact structures. The teeth become visible after acid etching. The effect is called pillaring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227846436|title=Characterization and significance of shocked quartz from the Woodleigh mpact structure, Western Australia (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minerals are not always cut by lot of lamellae, but are absolutely torn up or cut like slices. This is observable for example in the case of tourmalines from Czech pegmatites.

The spacing of cavitation lamellae can be from millimeters up to meters. A consolidation into compact blocks by fluidization of more smaller grains is suggested in the case of large quartz cores from pegmatites.

Ultrasonic cleaning effects that are well known from the technical practice are also discussed. Quartz between lamellae is very clear and thus contains almost no fluid inclusions. There exists an assumption that they collapsed due to many mechanical pulses.

There is found a grooving pattern on some samples of quartz. It looks like surface waves.[[File:Fracturesice.jpg|thumb|Typical fractures in ice.]]

Many [[rose quartz]] samples from the whole of the world contain systems of white lamellae. A causal relationship between the shock metamorphism and the origin of rose color could define the rose quartz as a shocked mineral. A similar relationship could be true also in the case of other quartz varieties.

Mechanical or electromagnetic waves move without mutual influencing. The cavitation lamellae intersect each other without visible mutual influencing, for example without mutual movements, as well. It is typical for various types of fractures and deformation lamellae that are connected with quartz [[undulose extinction]].

Rock fluidization due to a meteorite hit was already theorized and experimentally tested by [[H. Jay Melosh|H. J. Melosh]] and [[E. S. Gaffney]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=1983LPSC...13..830M Page 833|journal = Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Proceedings|volume = 88|pages = 830|bibcode = 1983LPSC...13..830M|last1 = Melosh|first1 = H. J.|last2 = Gaffney|first2 = E. S.|year = 1983|doi = 10.1029/JB088iS02p0A830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If we estimate the wavelength from the spacing of hypothetical cavitation lamellae, we get values that are equal to fractions of meters. We then obtain the frequencies in the order of min. 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Hz from the assumption that the waves going through rocks were of higher speed than the speed of the meteorite just before the hit (tens of thousands meters per second). The initial pressure impuls should even generate the waves of frequencies in the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Hz according to the hypothesis. This equals to typical frequencies of molecular vibrations. Such waves could be responsible for a short liquid behavior of quartz and other minerals.

The white lamellae frequently segue into shapes of wispy trails. Real experiments in liquids showed that such structures arise after a collapse of traveling bubble cavitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cavitation and bubble dynamics|last=1941-|first=Brennen, Christopher E.

== Other Explanations ==
[[File:Ametyst zony.jpg|thumb|Zonal growths in amethyst. The evolution of white areas in given sample is very variable. There is a question whether the cavitation lamellae described by Rajlich could be basically just a frame of the sample in the photo or not.]]The white lamellae are conventionally explained by two other ways. They can be '''zonal growths''' or '''tensile fractures''' that could be reactivated (healed) in many ways. The first option is less probable, because the lamellae intersect each other. The zonal growths respect the crystallographic planes. The second option is much more probable. Variations of tensile fractures can be found for example in ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ice-Structure Interaction|last=Schulson|first=E.

However the tensile fractures and various ruptures have in comparison to hypothetical cavitation lamellae usually not a straight shape, they are radially distributed, cracked or one fracture is linked to another fracture in its certain part.

'''Renaissance dances''' belong to the broad group of [[historical dance]]s.

==Overview==
During the Renaissance period, there was a distinction between country dances and court dances. Court dances required the dancers to be trained and were often for display and entertainment, whereas country dances could be attempted by anyone. At Court, the formal entertainment would often be followed by many hours of country dances which all present could join in. Dances described as country dances such as Chiarantana or Chiaranzana remained popular over a long period - over two centuries in the case of this dance. A Renaissance dance can be likened to a ball.

Knowledge of court dances has survived better than that of country dances as they were collected by dancing masters in manuscripts and later in printed books. The earliest surviving manuscripts that provide detailed dance instructions are from 15th century Italy. The earliest printed dance manuals come from late 16th century France and Italy. The earliest dance descriptions in England come from the Gresley manuscript {{circa}}1500 found in the Derbyshire Record Office, D77 B0x 38 pp 51–79. These have been recently published as "Cherwell Thy Wyne (Show your joy): Dances of fifteenth-century England from the Gresley manuscript".&lt;ref&gt;Ann and Paul Kent DHDS,2013 {{ISBN|978-0-9540988-1-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first printed English source appeared in 1652, the first edition of Playford.

The dances in these manuals are extremely varied in nature. They range from slow, stately dances ([[bassadance]], [[pavane]], [[allemande|almain]]) to fast, lively dances ([[galliard]], [[courante|coranto]], [[canarie (dance)|canario]]).  The former, in which the dancers' feet did not leave the ground were styled the ''dance basse'' while energetic dances with leaps and [[dance lift|lifts]] were called the ''haute dance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjXnoYihuu0C|pages=215|title=Elizabeth's London|author=Liza Picard|isbn=978-0-312-32566-4|year=2005|publisher=Macmillan|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some were choreographed, others were improvised on the spot. [[Image:Robert Dudley Elizabeth Dancing.jpg|thumb|left|French painting of the volta, from Penhurst Place, Kent, often wrongly assumed to be of Elizabeth I.]] One dance for couples, a form of the galliard called [[lavolta]], involved a rather intimate hold between the man and woman, with the woman being lifted into the air while the couple made a {{3/4}} turn.  Other dances, such as [[branle]]s or bransles, were danced by many people in a circle or line.

== Fifteenth-century Italian dance ==
Our knowledge of 15th-century Italian dances comes mainly from the surviving works of three Italian dance masters: [[Domenico da Piacenza]], [[Antonio Cornazzano]] and [[Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro]]. Their work deals with similar steps and dances, though some evolution can be seen. The main types of dances described are [[Basse danse|bassa danze]] and ''balletti''. These are the earliest European dances to be well-documented, as we have a reasonable knowledge of the choreographies, steps and music used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5603">The field of '''secular theology''', a subfield of [[liberal theology]] advocated by Anglican bishop [[John A. T. Robinson]] somewhat paradoxically combines [[secularism]] and [[theology]]. Recognized in the 1960s, it was influenced both by [[neo-orthodoxy]], [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], [[Harvey Cox]], and the [[existentialism]] of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Paul Tillich]]. Secular theology digested modern movements like the [[Death of God Theology]] propagated by [[Thomas J. J. Altizer]] or the philosophical existentialism of Paul Tillich and eased the introduction of such ideas into the theological mainstream and made constructive evaluations, as well as contributions, to them.&lt;ref name="isbn0-664-22422-9"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Williams, Rowan |author2=Robinson, John |author3=Hall, Douglas J. |title=Honest to God |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville, Ky |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-664-22422-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Shelby Spong]] advocates a nuanced approach to scripture (as opposed to blunt [[Biblical literalism]] at the other end of the scale), informed by scholarship and compassion, which he argues can be consistent with both Christian tradition and a contemporary understanding of the universe. Secular theology holds that [[theism]] has lost credibility as a valid conception of [[God]]'s nature.&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-067518-7"&gt;{{cite book |author=Spong, John Shelby |title=Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism : A Bishop Rethinks the Meaning of Scripture |publisher=HarperSanFrancisco |location=[San Francisco] |year=1991 |pages= |isbn=0-06-067518-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It rejects the concept of a  [[personal God]] and embraces the status of [[Jesus Christ]], [[Christology]] and [[Christian eschatology]] as [[Christian mythology]] without basis in historical events.&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-067546-2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Spong, John Shelby |title=Resurrection: myth or reality?: a bishop's search for the origins of Christianity |publisher=HarperSanFrancisco |location=[San Francisco] |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-06-067546-2 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-067523-3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Spong, John Shelby |title=Born of a Woman |publisher=HarperSanFrancisco |location=[San Francisco] |year= |pages= |isbn=0-06-067523-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement chiefly came about as a response to general dissatisfaction with the Christian establishment's tendency to lapse into "provincialism" when presented with the "unusual" theological ideas common during the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wesley.nnu.edu/wesleyan_theology/theojrnl/11-15/12-1.htm |title=THE PRESENT FRONTIERS OF WESLEYAN THEOLOGY |accessdate=2007-09-14 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903104412/http://wesley.nnu.edu/wesleyan_theology/theojrnl/11-15/12-1.htm |archivedate=September 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-664-22355-9"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dorrien, Gary J. |title=The Making of American Liberal Theology: Idealism, Realism, and Modernity, 1900-1950 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville, Ky |year= |pages= |isbn=0-664-22355-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-7546-3827-8"&gt;{{cite book |author=George Newlands |title=The Transformative Imagination: Rethinking Intercultural Theology |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |location= |year= |pages= |isbn=0-7546-3827-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement also suggested the legitimacy of seeking the [[holy]] outside the church itself. Thereby it suggests that the church did not have exclusive rights to divine inspiration. In a sense, this incorporated a strong sense of continuous revelation in which truth of the religious sort was sought out in poetry, music, art, or even the pub and in the street.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Certain other religions besides Christianity have developed secular theologies and applied these to core concepts of their own traditions. Notable among such movements has been the [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] of [[Mordecai Kaplan]], which understands God and the universe in a manner concordant with [[John Dewey|Deweyan]] naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1811 |title=Mordecai Kaplan's Pragmatic Religion |accessdate=2008-02-16|format = |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], the [[Advaita]] school of theology is generally regarded as non-theistic as it accepts all interpretations of God or [[Ishvara]].

The '''Suburates''' (also named ''Sibulates'') were a pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] tribe of the [[Aquitani]], settled in what today is the historical territory of [[Soule]] (in [[Basque language|Basque]] ''Xiberoa''), in the [[Northern Basque Country]]. From their name come the [[French language|French]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]] name for the region, ''Soule'', and the Basque names ''Xiberoa'' and ''Zuberoa''.&lt;ref name="Lemoine"&gt;Jacques Lemoine, ''Toponymie du Pays Basque Français et des Pays de l'Adour'', Picard 1977, {{ISBN|2-7084-0003-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Suburates spoke a form or dialect of the [[Aquitanian language]], a precursor of the [[Basque language]].&lt;ref name="Lemoine" /&gt;

The Siburates mentioned by [[Julius Caesar]], with the name of ''Sibusates'' in his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', which was his firsthand account of the [[Gallic Wars]], where he narrates the expedition of [[Publius Licinius Crassus (son of triumvir)|Publius Licinius Crassus]] to [[Gallia Aquitania|Aquitaine]], and also by [[Pliny the Elder]] as ''Sybillates''. The name ''Subola'', precedent of present-day Soule and Zuberoa, is attested for the first time in 635, when a column of a Franco-Burgundian expedition led by Duke Arnebert against the Basques was defeated by them.

'''Tavia Nyong'o''' is an [[United States|American]] cultural critic, historian and performance studies scholar.

He is currently a Professor of  [[American Studies]] at [[Yale University]] where he teaches courses on [[African diaspora|black diaspora]] performance, cultural studies, social and critical theory.

Nyong'o received his B.A. from [[Wesleyan University]]. He then received a [[Marshall Scholarship]] to study at the [[University of Birmingham]]. In 2003, he received his Ph.D. in American Studies from [[Yale]], where he studied under the mentorship of [[Paul Gilroy]] and [[Joseph Roach]]. Nyong'o was the 2004 runner-up for the Ralph Henry Gabriel Dissertation Award given by the [[American Studies Association]] annually for the best doctoral dissertation written in the field of American Studies. His book, ''The Amalgamation Waltz: Race, Performance, and the Ruses of Memory'', is published by the [[University of Minnesota Press]] (2009).

In addition, Nyong'o has published articles in ''[[The Nation]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20080121/nyongo Kenya's Rigged Election&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[n+1]]'', the ''[[Yale Journal of Criticism]]'', ''[[Social Text]]'', ''[[Theatre Journal]]'', ''Performance Research'', ''[[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies|GLQ]]'', and ''[[Women and Performance]]''. He has written on racial kitsch, televised politics, [[Afro-punk]] aesthetics, and on African American historical memory. 

He is a cousin of [[Academy Award]] winning actress [[Lupita Nyong'o]].

==Writing==
Tavia Nyong'o is the author of the essay ‘I've Got You Under My Skin’ Queer Assemblages, Lyrical Nostalgia and the African Diaspora. 
In his essay, Nyong'o explores the meaning of the word "diaspora". He is especially interested in the translocal community-building potential, of music, but worries that the very mobilizing and empowering aspects of diasporic music--a channel of community belonging--also divides and destroys communities.&lt;ref&gt;Tavia Nyong'o (2007) ‘I've Got You Under My Skin’ Queer assemblages, lyrical nostalgia and the African diaspora, Performance Research: A Journal of the Performing Arts, 12:3, 42-54&lt;/ref&gt; He writes, “The close affiliation of popular music with seduction, romance and sex speaks to the anxiety with which queerness is policed within it”.&lt;ref&gt;Page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Varima te takere.png|thumb|200px|The goddess Varima-te-takere in her womb-like domain in [[Avaiki]].]]
In [[Cook Islands mythology]], '''Varima-te-takere''' ("goddess of the beginning") also called '''Vari''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɑː|r|i}} {{respell|VAH|ree}}), was the primordial [[mother goddess|mother of the gods and mortals]]. 

According to [[William Wyatt Gill|Gill]], Vari, a female spirit or demon of flesh and blood, was admitted to the lowest depth of the interior of [[Avaiki]], a place described as resembling a vast hollow coconut shell. Such is the narrowness of her territory that her knees and chin touch, no other position being possible. Her name in full, Vari-ma-te-takere, Gill translates as "The very beginning". The word ''vari'', however, also means "mud", and, taken in conjunction with ''takere'' (canoe bottom or keel), the name literally means "The mud at the bottom"; suggesting the mud on the bottom of Avaiki. ''Vari'' is the mud of [[taro]] [[swamp]]s and connotes potential plant growth. As applied to a female, it means [[menstruation]] and conveys a connection with the [[female womb]] and the origin of human growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Te Rangi|last=Hiroa|date=1934|title=Mangaian Society: Creation myth|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-BucMangi-t1-body-d2-d1.html|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following passage from a dramatic song of creation (circa 1790) mentions Vari:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''But we have no father whatever:&lt;br&gt; Vari alone made us.&lt;br&gt; That home of Vari is &lt;br&gt; The very narrowest of all! &lt;br&gt; Vari's home is in the narrowest of spaces, &lt;br&gt; A goddess feeding on raw taro&lt;br&gt; At appointed periods of worship!&lt;br&gt; Thy mother, Vatea, is self-existent.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William Wyatt|last=Gill|date=1876|title=Myths and Songs from the South Pacific|url=https://archive.org/stream/mythsandsongsfro013889mbp#page/n35/mode/2up|page=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Vari was very anxious for progeny. At various times she created six children, three bits of flesh were plucked from each side of her body, and moulded into human form. These six are the primary gods of the universe. Yet no ''[[marae]]'' or image was ever sacred to them, nor was any offering made to them. These gods are: [[Vatea]] (or Avatea), the father of gods and men; [[Tinirau]], lord of the seas; [[Tango (mythology)|Tango]], lord of the birds; [[Tumu-te-ana-oa]], echo of the rocks; [[Raka (mythology)|Raka]], lord of the winds; and [[Tu-metua]], a beloved daughter whom Vari kept close to her in Avaiki. Tu-metua (or Tu-papa) was the [[tutelary deity]] of the island of [[Moorea]], and the fourteenth night in every moon was sacred to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William Wyatt|last=Gill|date=1979|title=Cook Islands Custom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wF3Dk2MrlXYC&amp;dq|page=23|isbn=9789820201705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''week''' is a [[time unit]] equal to seven [[day]]s. It is the standard time period used for cycles of rest days in most parts of the world, mostly alongside—although not strictly part of—the [[Gregorian calendar]].

The days of the week [[names of the days of the week|were named]] after the [[classical planets]] (derived from the astrological system of [[planetary hours]]) in the [[Roman era]]. In English, the names are [[Sunday]], [[Monday]], [[Tuesday]], [[Wednesday]], [[Thursday]], [[Friday]], and [[Saturday]]  .

[[ISO 8601]] includes the [[ISO week date]] system, a numbering system for weeks within a given year – each week begins on a Monday and is associated with the year that contains that week's Thursday (so that if a year starts in a long weekend Friday–Sunday, week number one of the year will start after that). ISO 8601 assigns numbers to the days of the week, running from 1 to 7 for  Monday through to Sunday.

The term "week" is sometimes expanded to refer to other time units comprising a few days, such as the [[nundinal cycle]] of the ancient Roman calendar, the "work week", or "school week" referring only to the days spent on those activities.

{{anchor|Etymology|Names}}

== Name ==
The English word ''[[:wikt:week|week]]'' comes from the [[Old English]] ''wice'', ultimately from a [[Common Germanic]] ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|wikōn-}}'', from a root ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|wik-}}'' "turn, move, change". The Germanic word probably had a wider meaning prior to the adoption of the [[Roman calendar]], perhaps "succession series", as suggested by [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''wikō'' translating ''taxis'' "order" in [[gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:8.

The seven-day week is named in many languages by a word derived from "seven". The [[archaism]] '''sennight''' ("seven-night") preserves the old Germanic practice of reckoning time by nights, as in the more common ''[[fortnight]]''  ("fourteen-night").&lt;ref name=worldwidewords&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-sen1.htm sennight] at worldwidewords.org (retrieved 12 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; '''Hebdomad''' and '''hebdomadal week''' both derive from the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] ''hebdomás'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|ἑβδομάς}}}}, "a seven"). The obsolete '''septimane''' is cognate with the [[Romance languages|Romance]] terms derived from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:septimana|septimana]]'' ("a seven").

Slavic has a formation ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/tъdьnь|*tъ(žь)dьnь]]'' (Serbian тједан, Croatian tjedan, Ukrainian тиждень, Czech ''týden'', Polish ''tydzień''), from  ''*tъ'' "this" +  ''*dьnь'' "day". Chinese has [[:wikt:星期|星期]], as it were "[[:wikt:星|planetary]] [[:wikt:期|time unit]]".

== Definition and duration ==
A week is defined as an interval of exactly seven [[day]]s,{{efn|1=In pre-modern times, days were measured either from sunset to sunset, or from sunrise to sunrise, so that the length of the week (and the day) would be subject to slight variations depending upon the time of year and the observer's geographical latitude.}} so that technically, except at [[daylight saving time]] transitions or [[leap seconds]],
: 1 week = 7 days = 168 hours = 10,080 minutes = 604,800 seconds.
With respect to the [[Gregorian calendar]]:
* 1 Gregorian calendar year = 52 weeks + 1 day (2 days in a [[leap year]])
* 1 week = {{Fraction|1600|6957}} ≈ 22.9984% of an average Gregorian month

In a [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] mean year, there are 365.2425 days, and thus exactly {{Fraction|52|71|400}} or 52.1775 weeks (unlike the [[Julian year (calendar)|Julian year]] of 365.25 days or {{Fraction|52|5|28}} ≈ 52.1786 weeks, which cannot be represented by a finite decimal expansion). There are exactly 20,871 weeks in 400 Gregorian years, so {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} -400}} was a {{CURRENTWEEKDAYNAME}} just as was {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}.

Relative to the path of the [[Moon]], a week is 23.659% of an average [[lunation]] or 94.637% of an average quarter lunation.



Historically, the system of [[Dominical letter]]s (letters A to G identifying the weekday of the first day of a given year) has been used to facilitate [[Determination of the day of the week|calculation of the day of week]].
The day of the week can be easily calculated given a date's [[Julian day number]] (JD, i.e. the integer value at [[noon]] [[Universal Time|UT]]): 
Adding one to the [[remainder]] after dividing the Julian day number by  seven (JD ''[[Modulo operation|modulo]]'' 7 + 1) yields that date's [[ISO 8601]] day of the week (for example, the Julian day number of {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} is {{#expr: floor({{CURRENTJULIANDAY}}+.5)}}. Calculating ({{#expr: floor({{CURRENTJULIANDAY}}+.5)}} mod 7 + 1) yields {{#expr: (floor({{CURRENTJULIANDAY}}+.5) mod 7) + 1}}, corresponding to {{CURRENTWEEKDAYNAME}}.&lt;!-- +.5 because the JD is integer at noon UT--&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Richards, E. G. (2013). "Calendars". In S. E. Urban &amp; P. K. Seidelmann, eds. ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'', 3rd ed. (pp. 585–624). Mill Valley, Calif.: University Science Books. 2013, pp. 592, 618.
This is equivalent to saying that JD0, i.e. 1 January 4713 BC of the [[proleptic Julian calendar]], was a Monday.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Days of the week ==
{{Main|Names of the days of the week}}
[[File:Weekday heptagram.ant.png|thumb|Schematic comparison of the ordering of the classical planets (arranged in a circle) and the sequence of days in the week (forming a {7/3} [[heptagram]] within the circle).]]
The days of the week were originally named for the [[classical planets]]. This naming system persisted alongside an "ecclesiastical" tradition of numbering the days, in [[ecclesiastical Latin]] beginning with ''dominica'' (the [[Day of the Lord]]) as the first day. The Greco-Roman gods associated with the classical planets were rendered in their ''[[interpretatio germanica]]'' at some point during the late Roman Empire, yielding the Germanic tradition of names based on indigenous deities.

The ordering of the weekday names is not the classical order of the planets (by distance in the [[planetary sphere]]s model, nor, equivalently, by their apparent speed of movement in the night sky). Instead, the [[planetary hours]] systems resulted in succeeding days being named for planets that are three places apart in their traditional listing. This characteristic was apparently discussed in [[Plutarch]] in a treatise written in c. AD 100, which is reported to have addressed the question of ''Why are the days named after the planets reckoned in a different order from the actual order?'' (the text of Plutarch's treatise has been lost).&lt;ref&gt;E. G. Richards, ''Mapping Time, the Calendar and History'', Oxford 1999. p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ecclesiastical, non-astrological, system of numbering the days of the week was adopted in Late Antiquity. This model also seems to have influenced (presumably via [[Gothic Christianity|Gothic]]) the designation of Wednesday as "mid-week" in [[Old High German]] (''mittawehha'') and [[Old Church Slavonic]] (срѣда). Old Church Slavonic may have also modeled the name of Monday, понєдѣльникъ, after the Latin ''feria secunda''.&lt;ref&gt;Max Vasmer, Russisches etymologisches Wörterbuch, s.v. понедельник; however, the Slavic languages later introduced a secondary numbering system that names Tuesday as the "second day".&lt;!-- Wiktionary claims "въторъкъ" as OCS, but Vasmer does not recognize an OCS precedent to Russian вторник, so it is unclear when this system was introduced.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The ecclesiastical system became prevalent in [[Eastern Christianity]], but in the [[Latin Christianity|Latin West]] it remains extant only in modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref&gt;the latter specifically due to the influence of [[Martin of Braga]], 6th-century archbishop of [[Braga]]. {{cite book|author=Richard A.

== History ==
A continuous seven-day cycle that runs throughout history paying no attention whatsoever to the phases of the moon was probably first practiced in [[Judaism]], dated to the 6th century BC at the latest.{{sfnp|Zerubavel|1989|loc=[https://books.google.ch/books?id=Cd5ZjRsNj4sC&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 11]}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are several hypotheses concerning the origin of the [[Old Testament|biblical]] seven-day cycle.

[[Friedrich Delitzsch]] and others suggested that the seven-day week being approximately a quarter of a [[lunation]] is the implicit astronomical origin of the seven-day week,&lt;ref name="LSC"&gt;{{cite journal

|page=176 ff.
|bibcode=1939PA.....47..175C}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed the [[Babylonian calendar]] used intercalary days to synchronize the last week of a month with the new moon.&lt;ref&gt;a month consisted of three seven-day weeks and a fourth week of eight or nine days, thus breaking the seven-day cycle every month. Consequently, there is no evidence that the days of the week were given individual names in Babylonian tradition. {{cite book|author=Pinches, T.G.|editor=Hastings, James|others=Selbie, John A., contrib|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics|volume=20|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=2003|pages=889–891|chapter=Sabbath (Babylonian)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVNqXDz4CE8C|isbn=978-0-7661-3698-4 |accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, the Jewish week was adopted from the Babylonians while removing the moon-dependency.

However, [[Niels-Erik Andreasen]], [[Jeffrey H. Tigay]] and others claimed that the [[Biblical Sabbath|sabbath]] is mentioned as a day of rest in some of the earliest layers of the [[Pentateuch]] dated to the 9th century BC at the latest, centuries before [[Judea]]'s Babylonian exile. They also find the resemblance between the biblical Sabbath and the Babylonian system to be weak. Therefore, they suggested that the seven-day week may reflect an independent [[Israelites|Israelite]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.il/books/about/The_Old_Testament_Sabbath.html?id=kE0YAAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |title=The Old Testament Sabbath: A Tradition-historical Investigation |last=Andreasen |first=Niels-Erik A. |date=1972 |publisher=Society of Biblical Literature |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shafer |first=Byron E. |date=1974 |title=Reviewed Work: ''The Old Testament Sabbath: A Tradition-Historical Investigation'' by Niels-Erik A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is clear that among neighboring nations that were in position to have an influence over Israel – and in fact which did influence it in various matters – there is no precise parallel to the Israelite Sabbatical week. This leads to the conclusion that the Sabbatical week, which is as unique to Israel as the Sabbath from which it flows, is an independent Israelite creation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Allen |date=Sep 2008 |title=Unnatural Time: Its History and Theological Significance |jstor=40914729 |journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal |volume=15 |pages=104–105 |postscript=, Tigay's citation. |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The seven-day week seems to have been adopted, at different stages, by the [[Persian Empire]], in [[Hellenistic astrology]], and (via [[Hellenistic period|Greek transmission]]) in [[Gupta India]] and [[Tang China]].{{efn|1=It was transmitted to China in the 8th century by Manichaeans, via the country of [[Kangju|Kang]] (a Central Asian polity near [[Samarkand]]).
Tang-era adoption is documented in the writings of the Chinese Buddhist monk [[I Ching (monk)|Yi Jing]] and the Ceylonese Buddhist monk [[Amoghavajra|Bu Kong]].
According to the Chinese encyclopaedia ''[[Cihai]]'' ({{Lang|zh-hans|辞海}}), there is
some evidence that the system had been adopted twice, the first time already in the 4th century ([[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]]), based on a reference by a Jin era astrologer, Fan Ning ({{Lang|zh-hant|范寧}} / {{Lang|zh-hans|范宁}}).
The ''Cihai'' under the entry for "seven luminaries calendar" ({{Lang|zh-hant|七曜曆}} / {{Lang|zh-hans|七曜历}}, ''qī yào lì'') has: "method of recording days according to the seven luminaries [{{Lang|zh|七曜}} ''qī yào'']. China normally observes the following order: Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. Seven days make one week, which is repeated in a cycle. Originated in ancient Babylon (or ancient Egypt according to one theory). Used by the Romans at the time of the 1st century AD, later transmitted to other countries. This method existed in China in the 4th century. It was also transmitted to China by Manichaeans in the 8th century from the country of Kang ({{Lang|zh|康}}) in Central Asia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Japanese Days of the Week: the 'Seven Luminaries' |url=http://www.cjvlang.com/Dow/dowjpn.html |website=Days of the Week in Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese &amp; Mongolian |publisher=cjvlang}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
The Babylonian system was received by the Greeks in the 4th century BC (notably via [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]). However the designation of the seven days of the week to the seven planets is an innovation introduced in the time of Augustus.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=PeVLAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA89#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Written Space in the Latin West, 200 BC to AD 300 |last=Keegan |first=Peter |last2=Sears |first2=Gareth |last3=Laurence |first3=Ray |date=2013-09-12 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=9781441123046|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The astrological concept of [[planetary hours]] is rather an original innovation of Hellenistic astrology, probably first conceived in the 2nd century BC.{{sfnp|Zerubavel|1989|loc=[https://books.google.ch/books?id=Cd5ZjRsNj4sC&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 14]}}

The seven day week was widely known throughout the [[Roman Empire]] by the 1st century AD,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; along with references to the Jewish Sabbath by Roman scholars such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e3ijDgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Jesus in Q: The Sabbath and Theology of the Bible and Extracanonical Texts |last=So |first=Ky-Chun |date=Apr 6, 2017 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |isbn=9781498282116 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seven day cycle ultimately replaced the older Roman system of the [[nundinal cycle]], probably during the 4th century.

=== Ancient Near East ===
The earliest evidence of an astrological significance of a seven-day period is connected to [[Gudea]], priest-king of [[Lagash]] in Sumer during the [[Gutian dynasty of Sumer|Gutian dynasty]], who built a seven-room temple, which he dedicated with a seven-day festival. In the flood story of the Assyro-Babylonian epic of [[Gilgamesh]] the storm lasts for seven days, the dove is sent out after seven days, and the [[Noah]]-like character of [[Utnapishtim]] leaves the ark seven days after it reaches firm ground.{{efn|1=Copeland (1939) states as the date for Gudea "as early as 2600 BC";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Copeland |first=Leland S. |title=Sources of the Seven-Day Week |journal=Popular Astronomy |date=1939 |volume=47 |issue=4 |page=176 |bibcode=1939PA.....47..175C}}&lt;/ref&gt; the modern estimate according to the [[short chronology]] places Gudea in the 22nd century BC. By contrast, [[Anthony R. Michaelis]] claims that "the first great empire builder, King Sargon I of Akkad ([ruled] 2335 to 2279 BC [viz., middle chronology]), decreed a seven-day week in his empire. He lived for 56 years, established the first Semitic Dynasty, and defeated the Sumerian City States. Thus the Akkadian language spread, it was adopted by the Babylonians, and the seven-day week was similarly inherited from him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Enigmatic Seven  |url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/michaelis/title310.pdf |journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews |volume=7 |page=373 |last=Michaelis |first=Anthony R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number seven is significant in Sumerian mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The power of seven |date=20 December 2001 |url=http://www.economist.com/node/895542?fsrc=scn/fb/wl/ar/thepowerofseven |newspaper=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--surely(!) we can come up with a better source for whatever we want to say with this.--&gt;}}

It seems likely that the Hebrew seven-day week is based on the Babylonian tradition, although going through certain adaptations.{{contradict-inline}} [[George Aaron Barton]] speculated that the seven-day creation account of Genesis is connected to the Babylonian creation epic, [[Enûma Eliš]], which is recorded on seven tablets.&lt;ref&gt;"Each account is arranged in a series of sevens, the Babylonian in seven tablets, the Hebrew in seven days. Each of them places the creation of man in the sixth division of its series." cited after: Albert T. Clay, ''The Origin of Biblical Traditions: Hebrew Legends in Babylonia and Israel'', 1923, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=JKBLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 p. 74].&lt;/ref&gt;

Counting from the [[new moon]], the Babylonians celebrated the 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th as "holy-days", also called "evil days" (meaning "unsuitable" for prohibited activities). On these days, officials were prohibited from various activities and common men were forbidden to "make a wish", and at least the 28th was known as a "rest-day".&lt;ref name=ere /&gt;
On each of them, offerings were made to a different god and goddess.

In a frequently-quoted suggestion going back to the early 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015027068470;view=1up;seq=197 |chapter=The Babylonian Sabbath |page=181 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015027068470;view=1up;seq=9 |title=The American Antiquarian and Oriental Journal |volume= Vol. XXX |year=1908 |access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Hebrew ''[[Sabbath etymology|Sabbath]]'' is compared to the Sumerian ''sa-bat'' "mid-rest", a term for the [[full moon]]. The Sumerian term has been reconstructed as rendered ''Sapattu&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' or ''Sabattu&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' in [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]], possibly present in the lost fifth tablet of the [[Enûma Eliš]], tentatively reconstructed {{according to whom|date=April 2015}} "[Sa]bbath shalt thou then encounter, mid[month]ly".&lt;!-- [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''um nuh libbi'' ("day of mid-repose") what is this, a reconstruction or an extant translation of Enuma Elish?--&gt;&lt;ref name="ere"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVNqXDz4CE8C|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics|author=Pinches, T.G.|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|others=Selbie, John A., contrib|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7661-3698-4|editor=Hastings, James|volume=20|pages=889–891|chapter=Sabbath (Babylonian)|accessdate=2009-03-17}}

=== Achaemenid period ===
The [[Zoroastrian calendar]] follows the Babylonian in relating the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th of the month to [[Ahura Mazda]].&lt;ref name="TSZ"&gt;Boyce, Mary (ed. &amp; trans.). ''Textual Sources for the Study of Zoroastrianism''. University of Chicago Press, 1984, p. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;
The forerunner of all modern Zoroastrian calendars is the system used to determine dates in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], adopted from the Babylonian calendar by the 4th century BC.

[[Frank Senn|Frank C. Senn]] in his book ''Christian Liturgy: Catholic and Evangelical'' points to data suggesting evidence of an early continuous use of a seven-day week; referring to the Jews during the [[Babylonian Captivity]] in the 6th century BC,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book

While the seven-day week in Judaism is tied to [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation account]] in the [[Book of Genesis]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] (where [[Elohim|God]] creates the heavens and the earth in six days and rests on the seventh; {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:1–2:3}}, in the [[Book of Exodus]], the fourth of the [[Ten Commandments]] is to rest on the seventh day, ''[[Biblical Sabbath|Shabbat]]'', which can be seen as implying a socially instituted seven-day week), it is not clear whether the Genesis narrative predates the [[Babylonian Captivity]] of the Jews in the 6th century BC. At least since the [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple period]] under Persian rule, Judaism relied on the seven-day cycle of recurring [[Sabbath]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Tablets{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} from the Achaemenid period indicate that the [[lunation]] of 29 or 30 days basically contained three seven-day weeks, and a final week of eight or nine days inclusive, breaking the continuous seven-day cycle.&lt;ref name=ere /&gt;
The Babylonians additionally celebrated the 19th as a special "evil day", the "day of anger", because it was roughly the 49th day of the (preceding) month, completing a "week of weeks", also with sacrifices and prohibitions.&lt;ref name=ere /&gt;

=== Hellenistic and Roman era ===
{{main|Nundinae}}
In [[Hellenistic Judaism|Jewish sources]] by the time of the [[Septuagint]], the term "Sabbath" ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''Sabbaton'') by synecdoche also came to refer to an entire seven-day week,&lt;ref&gt;''Strong's Concordance'', ''4521''.&lt;/ref&gt; the interval between two weekly Sabbaths.
[[Parables of Jesus|Jesus's parable]] of the [[Pharisee and the Publican]] ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+18%3A12 Luke 18:12]) describes the Pharisee as fasting "twice in the week" ([[Biblical Greek|Greek]] δὶς τοῦ σαββάτου ''dis tou sabbatou'').

The ancient Romans traditionally used the eight-day [[nundinum]] but, after the [[Julian calendar]] had come into effect in 45 BC, the seven-day week came into increasing use. For a while, the week and the nundinal cycle coexisted, but by the time the week was officially adopted by [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] in AD 321, the nundinal cycle had fallen out of use. The association of the [[days of the week]] with the Sun, the Moon and the five planets visible to the naked eye dates to the [[Roman era]] (2nd century).{{sfnp|Zerubavel|1989|loc=[https://books.google.ch/books?id=Cd5ZjRsNj4sC&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 45]}}&lt;ref&gt;

The continuous seven-day cycle of the days of the week can be traced back to the reign of [[Augustus]]; the first identifiable date cited complete with [[day of the week]] is 6 February [[AD 60]], identified as a "[[Sunday]]" (as ''viii idus Februarius dies solis'' "eighth day before the ides of February, day of the Sun") in a Pompeiian graffito. According to the (contemporary) Julian calendar, 6 February 60 was, however, a [[Wednesday]]. This is explained by the existence of two conventions of naming days of the weeks based on the [[planetary hours]] system: 6 February was a "Sunday" based on the sunset naming convention, and a "Wednesday" based on the sunrise naming convention.&lt;ref&gt;''Nerone Caesare Augusto Cosso Lentuol Cossil fil.

=== Adoption in Asia ===
==== China ====
The earliest known reference in Chinese writings to a seven-day week is attributed to Fan Ning, who lived in the late 4th century in the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]], while diffusions from the [[Manichaeism|Manichaeans]] are documented with the writings of the Chinese Buddhist monk [[I Ching (monk)|Yi Jing]] and the Ceylonese or Central Asian Buddhist monk [[Amoghavajra|Bu Kong]] of the 7th century ([[Tang Dynasty]]).

The Chinese variant of the planetary system was brought to Japan by the Japanese monk [[Kobo Daishi]] (9th century). Surviving diaries of the Japanese statesman [[Fujiwara Michinaga]] show the seven-day system in use in [[Heian Period|Heian]] Japan as early as 1007. In Japan, the seven-day system was kept in use for astrological purposes until its promotion to a full-fledged Western-style calendrical basis during the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] era.

==== India ====
The seven-day week was known in India by the 6th century, referenced in the [[Pancasiddhantika#Pancha-Siddhantika|Pañcasiddhāntikā]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Shashi (2000) mentions the [[Yuga Purana|Garga Samhita]], which he places in the 1st century BC or AD, as a possible earlier reference to a seven-day week in India. He concludes "the above references furnish a [[terminus ad quem]] (viz. 1st century) The [[Terminus post quem|terminus a quo]] cannot be stated with certainty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Arabia ===
In Arabia, a similar seven-week system was adopted, that may be influenced by the Hebrew week (via Christianity).

=== Christian Europe ===
{{further|Holy Week|Easter Week}}
The seven-day weekly cycle has remained unbroken in [[Christendom]], and hence in [[Western history]], for almost two millennia, despite changes to the [[Coptic calendar|Coptic]], [[Julian calendar|Julian]], and [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendars, demonstrated by the date of [[Easter]] Sunday having been traced back through numerous [[Computus|computistic tables]] to an Ethiopic copy of an early Alexandrian table beginning with the Easter of AD 311.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A tradition of divinations arranged for the days of the week on which certain feast days occur develops in the Early Medieval period. There are many later variants of this, including the German ''Bauern-Praktik'' and the versions of ''Erra Pater'' published in 16th to 17th century England, mocked in [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]''. South and East Slavic versions are known as ''koliadniki'' (from ''koliada'', a loan of Latin ''calendae''), with Bulgarian copies dating from the 13th century, and Serbian versions from the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Ryan380"&gt;William Francis Ryan, ''The Bathhouse at Midnight: An Historical Survey of Magic and Divination in Russia'', Penn State Press, 1999
[https://books.google.ch/books?id=S3qJMMYH6VYC&amp;pg=PA380 p. 380].&lt;/ref&gt;
Medieval Christian traditions associated with the lucky or unlucky nature of certain days of the week survived into the modern period. This concerns primarily [[Friday]], associated with the [[crucifixion of Jesus]]. [[Sunday]], sometimes personified as [[Anastasia the Patrician|Saint Anastasia]], was itself an object of worship in Russia, a practice denounced in a sermon extant in copies going back to the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Ryan383"&gt;William Francis Ryan, ''The Bathhouse at Midnight: An Historical Survey of Magic and Divination in Russia'', Penn State Press, 1999
[https://books.google.ch/books?id=S3qJMMYH6VYC&amp;pg=PA383 p. 383].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sunday]], in the ecclesiastical numbering system also counted as the ''feria prima'' or the first day of the week; yet, at the same time, figures as the "[[The eighth day (Christian)|eighth day]]", and has occasionally been so called in Christian liturgy.
{{efn|1=This is just a reflection of the system of [[ordinal numbers]] in the Greek and Latin languages, where today is the "first" day, tomorrow the "second" day, etc.  Compare the [[nundinal cycle]] (literally "nine-days" cycle, describing an [[eight-day week]]) of the Roman calendar, or the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] (after a period of less than 48 hours) being described (in texts derived from Latin) as happening on the "third day".}}

[[Justin Martyr]] wrote: "the first day after the Sabbath, remaining the first of all the days, is called, however, the eighth, according to the number of all the days of the cycle, and [yet] remains the first".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-dialoguetrypho.html |author=Peter Kirby |title=Saint Justin Martyr: Dialogue with Trypho |website=Early Christian Writings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A period of eight days, starting and ending on a Sunday, is called an [[octave (liturgical)|octave]], particularly in [[Roman Catholic liturgy]]. In German, the phrase ''in acht Tagen'' (literally "in eight days") means one week from today. In Italian, the phrase (''oggi otto'' (literally "today eight") also means one week from today.

== Week numbering ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[ISO 8601]] --&gt;
{{further|Leap week calendar}}
Weeks in a Gregorian calendar year can be numbered for each year. This style of numbering is commonly used (for example, by schools and businesses) in some European and Asian countries, but rare elsewhere.

[[ISO 8601]] includes the [[ISO week date]] system, a numbering system for weeks – each week begins on a Monday and is associated with the year that contains that week's Thursday (so that if a year starts in a long weekend Friday–Sunday, week number one of the year will start after that). For example, week 1 of 2004 (2004W01) ran from Monday, 29 December 2003 to Sunday, 4 January 2004, because its Thursday was 1 January 2004, whereas week 1 of 2005 (2005W01) ran from Monday, 3 January 2005 to Sunday, 9 January 2005, because its Thursday was 6 January 2005 and so the first Thursday of 2005. The highest week number in a year is either 52 or 53 (it was 53 in the year 2004). Schematically, this ISO convention translates as follows:

== "Weeks" in other calendars ==
The term "week" is sometimes expanded to refer to other time units comprising a few days. Such "weeks" of between four and ten days have been used historically in various places.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] s.v. "week ''n.''", entry 1.c.: "Sometimes applied ''transf.'' to other artificial cycles of a few days that have been employed various peoples"&lt;/ref&gt; Intervals longer than 10 days are not usually termed "weeks" as they are closer in length to the [[fortnight]] or the [[month]] than to the seven-day week.

=== Pre-modern calendars ===
Calendars unrelated to the Chaldean, Hellenistic, Christian or Jewish traditions often have time cycles between the day and the month of varying lengths, sometimes also called "weeks".

An [[eight-day week]] was used in [[Roman calendar#Nundinal cycle|Ancient Rome]] and possibly in the pre-Christian [[Celtic calendar]]. Traces of a [[nine-day week (disambiguation)|nine-day week]] are found in Baltic languages and in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. The ancient Chinese calendar had a [[Chinese ten-day week|ten-day week]], as did the ancient [[Egyptian calendar]] (and, incidentally, the [[French Republican Calendar]], dividing its 30-day months into thirds).

A six-day week is found in the [[Akan Calendar]]. Several cultures used a five-day week, including the 10th century [[Icelandic calendar]], the [[Javanese calendar]], and the traditional cycle of market days in [[Korean culture|Korea]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} The [[Igbo Culture#Calendar (Iguafo Igbo)|Igbo]] have a "market week" of four days. Evidence of a "three-day week" has been derived from the names of the days of the week in [[Guipuscoan Basque]].&lt;ref name="Knorr"&gt;''[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/fichero_articulo?articulo=26362&amp;orden=59718 Astronomy and Basque Language]'', [[Henrike Knörr]], ''Oxford VI and SEAC 99 "Astronomy and Cultural Diversity"'', [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna|La Laguna]], June 1999. It references [[Alessandro Bausani]], 1982, ''The prehistoric Basque week of three days: archaeoastronomical notes'', ''The Bulletin of the [[Center for Archaeoastronomy]]'' (Maryland), v. 2, 16–22.
1. ''astelehena'' ("week-first", Monday), 2. ''asteartea'' ("week-between", Tuesday), 3. ''asteazkena'' ("week-last", Wednesday).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aztecs and Mayas used the [[Mesoamerican calendars]]. The most important of these calendars divided a ritual cycle of 260 days (known as ''[[Tonalpohualli]]'' in [[Nahuatl]] and ''[[Tzolk'in]]'' in [[Yucatec Maya]]) into 20 weeks of 13 days (known in Spanish as [[trecena]]s). They also divided the solar year into 18 periods of 20 days and five nameless days, creating a 20-day month divided into four five-day weeks. The end of each five-day week was a market day.{{sfnp|Zerubavel|1989|loc=[https://books.google.ch/books?id=Cd5ZjRsNj4sC&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 50–54]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aztec-history.com/aztec-calendar-stone.html |title=Aztec calendar stone |website=aztec-history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Balinese [[Pawukon]] is a 210-day calendar consisting of 10 different simultaneously running weeks of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 days, of which the weeks of 4, 8 and 9 days are interrupted to fit into the 210-day cycle.

=== Modern calendar reforms ===

A 10-day week, called ''décade'', was used in France for nine and a half years from October 1793 to April 1802; furthermore, the [[Paris Commune]] adopted the Revolutionary Calendar for 18 days in 1871.

The Bahá'í calendar features a 19-day period which some classify as a month and others classify as a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Seven-Day Circle |last=Zerubavel |first=Eviatar |publisher=The Free Press |year=1985 |isbn=0029346800 |location=New York |pages=48–50 |author-link=Eviatar Zerubavel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Fixed Calendar]] (also known as the "Eastman plan") fixed every date always on the same weekday. This plan kept a 7-day week while defining a year of 13 months with 28 days each. It was the official calendar of the [[Eastman Kodak Company]] for decades.

In the [[Soviet Union]] between 1929 and 1940, most factory and enterprise workers, but not collective farm workers, used five- and six-day work weeks while the entire country continued to use the traditional seven-day week.&lt;ref name=Foss&gt;{{cite journal |first=Clive |last=Foss |title=Stalin's topsy-turvy work week |journal=History Today |volume=54 |issue=9 |date=September 2004 |pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Russie&gt;{{cite web |website=iCalendrier |url=http://icalendrier.fr/calendriers-saga/etudes-thematiques/reforme-gregorienne#russie |title=La réforme en Russie: il faudra attendre… plus de trois siècles |language=fr |trans-title=The reform in Russia: it will be necessary to wait… more than three centuries }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zerubavel&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Eviatar Zerubavel |last=Zerubavel |first=Eviatar |chapter=The Soviet five-day ''Nepreryvka'' |title=The Seven Day Circle |isbn=0029346800 |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |year= 1985 |pages=35–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1929 to 1951, five national holidays were days of rest ({{nowrap|22 January}}, {{nowrap|1–2 May}}, {{nowrap|7–8 November}}). From autumn 1929 to summer 1931, the remaining 360 days of the year were subdivided into 72 five-day work weeks beginning on {{nowrap|1 January}}. Workers were assigned any one of the five days as their day off, even if their spouse or friends might be assigned a different day off. Peak usage of the five-day work week occurred on {{nowrap|1 October 1930}} at 72% of industrial workers. From summer 1931 until {{nowrap|26 June 1940}}, each Gregorian month was subdivided into five six-day work weeks, more-or-less, beginning with the first day of each month. The sixth day of each six-day work week was a uniform day of rest. On {{nowrap|1 July 1935}} 74.2% of industrial workers were on non-continuous schedules, mostly six-day work weeks, while 25.8% were still on continuous schedules, mostly five-day work weeks. The Gregorian calendar with its irregular month lengths and the traditional seven-day week were used in the Soviet Union during its entire existence, including 1929–1940; for example, in the masthead of [[Pravda]], the official Communist newspaper, and in both Soviet calendars displayed here. The traditional names of the seven-day week continued to be used, including "Resurrection" (Воскресенье) for Sunday and "Sabbath" (Суббота) for Saturday, despite the government's officially atheistic policy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26241">'''Whig history''' (or '''Whig historiography''') is an approach to [[historiography]] that presents the past as an inevitable progression towards ever greater [[liberty]] and [[wikt:enlightenment|enlightenment]], culminating in modern forms of [[liberal democracy]] and [[constitutional monarchy]].

In general, Whig historians emphasize the rise of [[constitutional government]], [[personal freedom]]s and [[scientific progress]]. The term is often applied generally (and [[pejoratively]]) to histories that present the past as the inexorable march of [[Progress (history)|progress]] towards enlightenment. The term is also used extensively in the [[history of science]] to mean historiography that focuses on the successful chain of theories and experiments that led to present-day science, while ignoring failed theories and dead ends.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Mayr, "When is Historiography Whiggish?" in ''Journal of the History of Ideas,'' April 1990, Vol. 51 Issue 2, pp 301–309 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2709517 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whig history is a form of [[liberalism]], putting its faith in the power of human reason to reshape society for the better, regardless of past history and tradition. It proposes the inevitable progress of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew R. Murphy|title=Conscience and Community: Revisiting Toleration and Religious Dissent in Early Modern England and America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=19vkEZyd_voC&amp;pg=PA20|year=2010|publisher=Penn State  Press|page=20|isbn=978-0271041377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The British historian [[Herbert Butterfield]] coined the term "Whig history" in his short but influential book ''The Whig Interpretation of History'' (1931). It takes its name from the British [[Whiggism|Whigs]], advocates of the power of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], who opposed the [[Tory|Tories]], advocates of the power of the king.

The term has been applied widely in historical disciplines outside of [[British history]] (the [[history of science]], for example) to criticize any [[Teleology|teleological]] (or goal-directed), hero-based and [[Transhistoricity|transhistorical]] narrative: in a non-British, more general context, 'whig history' (lower-case) is preferred.&lt;ref&gt;J Burrow, ''A History of Histories'' (Penguin 2009) p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; The [[abstract noun]] "whiggishness" is sometimes used as a generic term for Whig historiography.

Whig history has no direct relation to either the [[British Whig Party|British Whig]] or [[Whig Party (United States)|American Whig]] parties and should not be confused with "[[Whiggism]]", which is a political ideology. The term "[[Whig (disambiguation)|Whiggery]]" is ambiguous in contemporary usage: it may either mean party politics and ideology, or a general intellectual approach.

== Butterfield's intervention ==
When [[H. A. L. Fisher]] in 1928 gave a Raleigh lecture on ''The Whig Historians, from [[Sir James Mackintosh]] to [[George Macaulay Trevelyan|Sir George Trevelyan]]'', he implied that "Whig historian" was adequately taken as a political rather than a progressive or teleological label and this put the concept into play.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bentley, ''Modernizing England's Past: English Historiography in the Age of Modernism'' (2005), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; P. B. M. Blaas, author of the book ''Continuity and Anachronism'', has argued that Whig history itself had lost all vitality by 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterfield's book on the Whig interpretation marked the emergence of a negative concept in historiography under a convenient phrase, but was not isolated. Undermining whiggish narratives was one aspect of the post–World War I re-evaluation of [[European history]] in general and Butterfield's critique exemplified this trend. Intellectuals no longer believed the world was automatically getting better and better. Subsequent generations of academic historians have similarly rejected Whig history because of its [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentist]] and teleological assumption that history is driving toward some sort of goal. According to Victor Feske, there is too much readiness to accept Butterfield's classic formulation from 1931 as definitive.&lt;ref&gt;''From Belloc to Churchill: Private Scholars, Public Culture, and the Crisis of British Liberalism, 1900–1939'' (1996), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Keith Sewell, ''Herbert Butterfield and the Interpretation of History'', was published in 2005.

=== Butterfield's formulation ===
The characteristics of Whig history as defined by Butterfield include interpreting history as a story of progress toward the present and specifically toward the [[British constitution]]al settlement. Butterfield wrote:{{quote|It is part and parcel of the whig interpretation of history that it studies the past with reference to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert Butterfield|title=The Whig Interpretation of History|year=1931|chapter=2. The Underlying Assumption|chapter-url=http://www.eliohs.unifi.it/testi/900/butterfield/chap_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Typical distortions thereby introduced are:
* Viewing the British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]]ary, [[constitutional monarchy]] as the apex of human political development;
* Assuming that the constitutional monarchy was in fact an ideal held throughout all ages of the past, despite the observed facts of British history and the several power struggles between monarchs and parliaments;
* Assuming that political figures in the past held current political beliefs ([[anachronism]]);
* Assuming that British history was a march of progress whose inevitable outcome was the constitutional monarchy; and
* Presenting political figures of the past as heroes who advanced the cause of this political progress, or villains who sought to hinder its inevitable triumph.&lt;ref&gt;''According to its critics, a Whig interpretation requires human heroes and villains in the story.'' J. Hart, ''Nineteenth-Century Social Reform: A Tory Interpretation of History'', Past &amp; Present 1965 31(1):39–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterfield argued that this approach to history compromised the work of the historian in several ways. The emphasis on the inevitability of progress leads to the mistaken belief that the progressive sequence of events becomes "a line of [[causation (sociology)|causation]]", tempting the historian to go no further to investigate the causes of historical change.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Butterfield, ''The Whig Interpretation of History'', (New York: W. W. Norton), 1965, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on the present as the goal of historical change leads the historian to a special kind of abridgement, selecting only those events that seem important from the present point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, pp. 24–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterfield's antidote to Whig history was "to evoke a certain sensibility towards the past, the sensibility which studies the past 'for the sake of the past', which delights in the concrete and the complex, which 'goes out to meet the past', which searches for 'unlikenesses between past and present'".&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Wilson and T. G. Ashplant, "Whig History and Present-Centred History," ''The Historical Journal'', 31 (1988): 1–16, at p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A decade later however - if under wartime pressure - Butterfield would note of the Whig interpretation that "Whatever it may have done to our history, it has had a wonderful effect on our politics....In every Englishman there is hidden something of a whig that seems to tug at the heart-strings".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J Burrow, ''A History of Histories'' (Pengion 2009) p. 474&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsequent views ===
Butterfield's formulation has subsequently received much attention and the kind of historical writing he argued against in generalized terms is no longer academically respectable. Despite its polemical success, Butterfield's celebrated book itself has been criticized by [[David Cannadine]] as "slight, confused, repetitive and superficial".&lt;ref&gt;''G. M. Trevelyan'' (1992), p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Bentley (historian)|Michael Bentley]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bentley, ''Modern Historiography: An Introduction'' (1999), pp. 64–5.&lt;/ref&gt; analyses the "Whig theory" according to Butterfield as equivalent to the formation of a canon of 19th-century historians of England (such as [[William Stubbs]], [[James Anthony Froude]], [[E. A. Freeman]], [[J. R. Green]], [[W. E. H. Lecky]], [[Lord Acton]], [[J. R. Seeley]], [[S. R. Gardiner]], [[C. H. Firth]] and [[J. B. Bury]]) that in fact excludes few except [[Thomas Carlyle]]. The theory identifies the common factors and Bentley comments: &lt;blockquote&gt;Carlyle apart, the so-called Whigs were predominantly [[Christian]], predominantly [[Anglican]], thinkers for whom the [[Reformation]] supplied the critical theatre of enquiry when considering the origins of modern England. When they wrote about the history of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|English constitution]], as so many of them did, they approached their story from the standpoint of having [[Good News (Christianity)|Good News]] to relate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Roger Scruton]], in his ''A Dictionary of Political Thought'' (1982), takes the theory underlying "Whig history" to be centrally concerned with [[social progress]] and [[Reactionary|reaction]], with the progressives shown as victors and benefactors. Of the English tradition, Cannadine wrote:&lt;ref&gt;''G. M. Trevelyan'', p.197.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;It was fiercely partisan and righteously judgemental, dividing the personnel of the past into the good and the bad. And it did so on the basis of the marked preference for [[Liberalism|liberal]] and progressive causes, rather than [[conservative]] and reactionary ones. [...] Whig history was, in short, an extremely biased view of the past: eager to hand out moral judgements, and distorted by teleology, anachronism and present-mindedness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== British Whig historians ==
[[Paul de Rapin|Paul Rapin de Thoyras]]'s history of England, published in 1723, became "the classic Whig history" for the first half of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Trevor-Roper, 'Introduction', ''Lord Macaulay's History of England'' (Penguin Classics, 1979), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Rapin claimed that the English had preserved their [[ancient constitution]] against the absolutist tendencies of the [[Stuarts]]. However, Rapin's history lost its place as the standard history of England in the late 18th century and early 19th century to that of [[David Hume]].

=== David Hume ===
In ''[[The History of England (Hume)|The History of England]]'' (1754–1761), Hume challenged Whig views of the past and the Whig historians in turn attacked Hume; but they could not dent his history. In the early 19th century, some Whig historians came to incorporate Hume's views, dominant for the previous fifty years. These historians were members of the ''New Whigs'' around [[Charles James Fox]] (1749–1806) and [[Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland|Lord Holland]] (1773–1840) in opposition until 1830 and so "needed a new historical philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Fox himself intended to write a history of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, but only managed the first year of [[James II of England|James II]]'s reign. A fragment was published in 1808. [[James Mackintosh]] then sought to write a Whig history of the Glorious Revolution, published in 1834 as the ''History of the Revolution in England in 1688''. [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1765–1769) and [[Henry Hallam]]'s ''Constitutional History of England'' (1827) reveal many Whiggish traits. According to [[Arthur Marwick]], Hallam was the first Whig historian.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nature of History'' (second edition 1980), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thomas Babington Macaulay ===
Hume still dominated English historiography, but this changed when [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]], utilising Fox and Mackintosh's work and manuscript collections, published the first volumes of his ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James II]]'' in 1848. It proved an immediate success, replacing Hume's history and becoming the new orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, pp. 25–6.&lt;/ref&gt; While Macaulay was a popular and celebrated historian of the Whig school, his work did not feature in Butterfield's 1931 book. According to Ernst Breisach, "his style captivated the public as did his good sense of the past and firm Whiggish convictions".&lt;ref&gt;''Historiography'' (second edition, 1994), p.251.&lt;/ref&gt; The first chapter of Macaulay's ''History of England'' proposes:

{{quote|I shall relate how the new settlement was, during many troubled years, successfully defended against foreign and domestic enemies; how, under that settlement, the authority of law and the security of property were found to be compatible with a liberty of discussion and of individual action never before known; how, from the auspicious union of order and freedom, sprang a prosperity of which the annals of human affairs had furnished no example; how our country, from a state of ignominious [[vassalage]], rapidly rose to the place of umpire among European powers; how her opulence and her martial glory grew together; how, by wise and resolute good faith, was gradually established a public credit fruitful of marvels which to the statesmen of any former age would have seemed incredible; how a gigantic commerce gave birth to a maritime power, compared with which every other maritime power, ancient or modern, sinks into insignificance; how Scotland, after ages of enmity, was at length united to England, not merely by legal bonds, but by indissoluble ties of interest and affection; how, in America, the [[British colonies]] rapidly became far mightier and wealthier than the realms which [[Hernán Cortés|Cortes]] and [[Francisco Pizarro|Pizarro]] had added to the dominions of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]; how in Asia, British adventurers founded an empire not less splendid and more durable than that of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]].

... [T]he history of our country during the last hundred and sixty years is eminently the history of physical, of moral, and of intellectual improvement.}}

=== William Stubbs ===
[[William Stubbs]] (1825–1901), the constitutional historian and influential teacher of a generation of historians, became a crucial figure in the later survival and respectability of Whig history. According to Reba Soffer: "His rhetorical gifts often concealed his combination of High Church Anglicanism, Whig history, and civic responsibility".&lt;ref&gt;Reba Soffer, ''Discipline and Power: The University, History, and the Making of an English Elite'' (1994), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of education ===
Political history was the usual venue for Whig history, but it also appears in other areas.  [[Robert Hebert Quick]] (1831–1891) and G. A. N. Lowndes were the leaders of the Whig school of the history of education. In 1898, Quick explained the value of studying the history of educational reform, arguing that the great accomplishments of the past were cumulative and comprised the building blocks that “would raise us to a higher standing-point from which we may see much that will make the right road clearer to us”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gary McCulloch, ''The Struggle for the History of Education'' (Routledge, 2011), p 29&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other examples ==
=== In Canada ===
For Canada, Allan Greer argues:
{{quote|The interpretive schemes that dominated Canadian historical writing through the middle decades of the twentieth century were built on the assumption that history had a discernible direction and flow. Canada was moving towards a goal in the nineteenth century; whether this endpoint was the construction of a transcontinental, commercial, and political union, the development of parliamentary government, or the preservation and resurrection of French Canada, it was certainly a Good Thing. Thus the rebels of 1837 were quite literally on the wrong track. They lost because they ''had'' to lose; they were not simply overwhelmed by superior force, they were justly chastised by the God of History.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Greer, "1837-38: Rebellion reconsidered" ''Canadian Historical Review'' (1995) 76#1 pp 1-18, quotation on page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== In the history of science ===
It has been argued that the [[historiography of science]] is "riddled with Whiggish history".&lt;ref&gt;C. T. McIntire, ''Herbert Butterfield: Historian as Dissenter'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Whig histories, Whig history of science tends to divide historical actors into "good guys" who are on the side of truth (as is now known), and "bad guys" who opposed the emergence of these truths because of ignorance or bias.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Schuster,"The Problem of Whig History in the History of Science, Chap 3 of The Scientific Revolution: Introduction to History and Philosophy of Science [http://descartes-agonistes.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=38&amp;Itemid=53]&lt;/ref&gt; From this Whiggish perspective, [[Ptolemy]] would be criticized because his astronomical system placed the Earth at the center of the universe while [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] would be praised because he placed the Sun at the center of the solar system. This kind of evaluation ignores historical background and the evidence that was available at a particular time: did Aristarchus have evidence to support his idea that the Sun was at the center? Were there good reasons to reject Ptolemy's system before the sixteenth century?

The writing of Whig history of science is especially found in the writings of scientists&lt;ref&gt;"The conventional stories of the past that appear in the introductory chapters of science textbooks are certainly a form of Whiggism.  Historians take great delight in exposing the artificially constructed nature of these stories, and some scientists find the results uncomfortable."  Peter J. Bowler and Iwan Rhys Morus, ''Making Modern Science: A Historical Survey'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 2005) {{ISBN|0-226-06861-7}}, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and general historians,&lt;ref&gt;"the history of science – as composed by both ex-scientists and general historians – has largely consisted of Whig history, in which the scientific winners write the account in such a way as to make their triumph an inevitable outcome of the righteous logic of their cause." Ken Alder, "The History of Science, or, an Oxymoronic Theory of Relativistic Objectivity", pp. 297–318 in Lloyd Kramer and Sarah Maza, ed., ''A Companion to Western Historical Thought'', (Blackwell,), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; while this whiggish tendency is commonly opposed by professional historians of science. [[Nicholas Jardine]] describes the changing attitude to whiggishness this way:&lt;ref&gt;Nick Jardine, "Whigs and Stories: Herbert Butterfield and the Historiography of Science," .[http://www.shpltd.co.uk/jardine-whigs.pdf ''History of Science''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612060629/http://www.shpltd.co.uk/jardine-whigs.pdf |date=2007-06-12 }}, 41 (2003): 125–140, at pp. 127–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;By the mid-1970s, it had become commonplace among historians of science to employ the terms 'Whig' and 'Whiggish', often accompanied by one or more of 'hagiographic', 'internalist', 'triumphalist', even 'positivist', to denigrate grand narratives of scientific progress. At one level there is, indeed, an obvious parallel with the attacks on Whig constitutional history in the opening decades of the century. For, as P. B. M. Blaas has shown, those earlier attacks were part and parcel of a more general onslaught in the name of an autonomous, professional and scientific history, on popular, partisan and moralising historiography. Similarly,&amp;nbsp;...  For post-WWII champions of the newly professionalized history of science the targets were quite different. Above all, they were out to establish a critical distance between the history of science and the teaching and promotion of the sciences. In particular, they were suspicious of the grand celebratory and didactic narratives of scientific discovery and progress that had proliferated in the inter-war years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More recently, some scholars have argued that Whig history is essential to the history of science. At one level, "the very term 'the history of science' has itself profoundly Whiggish implications. One may be reasonably clear what 'science' means in the 19th century and most of the 18th century. In the 17th century 'science' has very different meaning. For example chemistry is inextricably mixed up with alchemy. Before the 17th century dissecting out such a thing as 'science' in anything like the modern sense of the term involves profound distortions".&lt;ref&gt;R. Anthony Hyman, [http://www.projects.ex.ac.uk/babbage/whiggism.html "Whiggism in the History of Science and the Study of the Life and Work of Charles Babbage"]&lt;/ref&gt; The science historians' rejection of whiggishness has been criticized by some scientists for failing to appreciate the temporal depth of scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Harrison, "Whigs, prigs and historians of science", ''Nature,'' 329 (1987): 213–14. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v329/n6136/abs/329213a0.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As teleology ===
In ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' (1986, see [[anthropic principle]] for details), [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank J. Tipler]] identify Whiggishness (Whiggery) with a [[teleological]] principle of convergence in history to [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{BarrowTipler1986|pages=9–11, 135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In popular culture ===
Despite their shortcomings as interpretations of the past, Whiggish histories continue to influence popular understandings of political and social development. This persistence reflects the power of dramatic narratives that detail epic struggles for enlightened ideals. Aspects of the Whig interpretation are apparent in films, television, political rhetoric and even history textbooks:&lt;ref&gt;James A. Hijiya, "Why the West is Lost", ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', 3rd Ser., Vol. 51, No. 2. (Apr., 1994), pp. 276–292.&lt;/ref&gt; thus in the debate over Britishness, for example, [[David Marquand]] praised the Whig approach on the grounds that "Ordered freedom and evolutionary progress ''have'' been among the hallmarks of modern British history, and they ''should'' command respect".&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, in A Gamble ed., ''Britishness'' (Oxford 2009) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular understandings of [[human evolution]] and [[paleoanthropology]] may be imbued with a form of "whiggishness". See for example the celebrated scientific illustration, ''[[March of Progress (illustration)|The March of Progress]]'' (1965). Most portrayals and fictionalized adaptations of the [[Scopes Trial]], such as in ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (1955), subscribe to a Whig view of the trial and its aftermath. This was challenged by historian [[Edward J. Larson]] in his book ''Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion'' (1997), for which he won the [[Pulitzer Prize for History]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald P. Ladouceur, "Ella Thea Smith and the Lost History of American High School Biology Textbooks", ''Journal of the History of Biology'', Vol. 41, No. 3 (September 2008), pp. 435–471.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent examples addressing moral progress include [[Steven Pinker]]'s ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature]]'' and [[Michael Shermer]]'s ''[[The Moral Arc]]''. Both argue that the modern world is much more moral. Pinker is criticized for collapsing distinctions and misrepresenting humanity's past by [[Douglas P. Fry]] and [[R. Brian Ferguson]] in ''War, Peace and Human Nature''; and [[Darcia Narvaez]] points out the opposite trajectory in ''Neurobiology and the Development of Human Morality: Evolution, Culture and Wisdom''.
