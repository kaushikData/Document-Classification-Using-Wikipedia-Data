The Antarctic comprises the continent of [[Antarctica]], the [[Kerguelen Plateau]] and other [[List of Antarctic and subantarctic islands|island territories]] located on the [[Antarctic Plate]] or south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]]. The Antarctic region includes the [[ice shelf|ice shelves]], waters, and all the [[island]] territories in the [[Southern Ocean]] situated south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]], a zone approximately {{convert|32|to|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide varying in latitude seasonally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scar.org/ |title=Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research website |publisher=SCAR |author= |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214094758/http://www.scar.org/ |archivedate=2013-12-14 |deadurl=yes |access-date=2015-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The region covers some 20 percent of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], of which 5.5 percent (14 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself. All of the land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of [[60th parallel south|60°S latitude]] are administered under the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]. [[Biogeographically]], the [[Antarctic ecozone]] is one of eight [[ecozone]]s of the Earth's land surface.

== Geography ==
The maritime part of the region constitutes the area of application of the international [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] (CCAMLR), where for technical reasons the Convention uses an approximation of the Convergence line by means of a line joining specified points along [[Circle of latitude|parallels of latitude]] and [[Meridian (geography)|meridians of longitude]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/e_pubs/bd/pt1.pdf Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505214806/http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/E/e_pubs/bd/pt1.pdf |date=2010-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The implementation of the Convention is managed through an international Commission headquartered in [[Hobart]], Australia, by an efficient system of annual [[fishing]] quotas, licenses and international inspectors on the fishing vessels, as well as [[satellite]] surveillance.

Most of the Antarctic region is situated south of 60°S latitude parallel, and is governed in accordance with the international legal regime of the [[Antarctic Treaty System]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/antarct/anttrty.jsp Antarctic Treaty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117002928/https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/antarct/anttrty.jsp |date=2012-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Treaty area covers the continent itself and its immediately adjacent islands, as well as the [[archipelago]]s of the [[South Orkney Islands]], [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Peter I Island|Peter&amp;nbsp;I Island]], [[Scott Island]] and [[Balleny Islands]].

The islands situated between 60°S latitude parallel to the south and the [[Antarctic Convergence]] to the north, and their respective {{convert|200|nmi|km|adj=on}} [[exclusive economic zone]]s fall under the national jurisdiction of the countries that possess them: [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] (United Kingdom; also an [[European Union|EU]] [[Overseas Countries and Territories#Overseas countries and territories|Overseas territory]]), [[Bouvet Island]] (Norway), and [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands|Heard and McDonald Islands]] (Australia).

[[Kerguelen Islands]] (France; also an EU Overseas territory) are situated in the Antarctic Convergence area, while the [[Falkland Islands]], [[Isla de los Estados]], [[Hornos Island]] with [[Cape Horn]], [[Diego Ramírez Islands]], [[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]], [[Macquarie Island]], [[Île Amsterdam|Amsterdam]] and [[Île Saint-Paul|Saint Paul]] Islands, [[Crozet Islands]], [[Prince Edward Islands]], and [[Gough Island]] and [[Tristan da Cunha|Tristan da Cunha group]] remain north of the Convergence and thus outside the Antarctic region.

==People==
The first Antarctic land discovered was the island of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands#Geography|South Georgia]], visited by the [[Kingdom of England|English]] merchant [[Anthony de la Roché]] in 1675. Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' ("Southern Land") date back to antiquity, the first confirmed sighting of the continent of [[Antarctica]] is commonly accepted to have occurred in 1820 by the [[List of Russian explorers|Russian expedition]] of [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Lazarev]] on ''[[Vostok (sloop-of-war)|Vostok]]'' and ''[[Mirny (sloop-of-war)|Mirny]]''. The first human born in the Antarctic was [[Solveig Gunbjørg Jacobsen]] born on 8 October 1913 in [[Grytviken]], South Georgia.

The Antarctic region had no [[indigenous population]] when first discovered, and its present inhabitants comprise a few thousand transient [[science|scientific]] and other personnel working on tours of duty at the several dozen [[Research stations in Antarctica|research stations]] maintained by various countries.  However, the region is visited by more than 40,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.zenn.net/REPLACE/CLIENT/1000037/1000116/application/pdf/touristsbynationality_total2.pdf IAATO tourist statistics 2007/08]&lt;/ref&gt; tourists annually, the most popular destinations being the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] area (especially the [[South Shetland Islands]]) and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands#Geography|South Georgia Island]].

In December 2009, the growth of [[Tourism in Antarctica|tourism]], with consequences for both the ecology and the safety of the travellers in its great and remote wilderness, was noted at a conference in New Zealand by experts from signatories to the [[Antarctic Treaty]]. The definitive results of the conference was presented at the Antarctic Treaty states' meeting in Uruguay in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.680news.com/news/world/article/5976 Antarctic Nations Considering New Controls On Ships Amid Tourism Explosion.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118154613/http://www.680news.com/news/world/article/5976 |date=2012-01-18 }} Ray Lilley, The Associated Press, December 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation ==

== Time zones ==
{{main|Time in Antarctica}}
Because Antarctica surrounds the South Pole, it is theoretically located in all [[time zone]]s. For practical purposes, time zones are usually based on [[Territorial claims in Antarctica|territorial claims]] or the time zone of a station's owner country or supply base.

The '''Arabian Desert''' is a vast [[desert]] wilderness in [[Western Asia]].  It stretches from [[Yemen]] to the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Oman]] to [[Jordan]] and [[Iraq]].  It occupies most of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], with an area of {{convert|2,330,000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. It is the [[List of deserts by area|fourth largest desert in the world]], and the largest in Asia.  At its center is the [[Empty Quarter|Rub'al-Khali]], one of the largest continuous bodies of [[sand]] in the world.

[[Gazelle]]s, [[oryx]], [[sand cat]]s, and [[spiny-tailed lizard]]s are just some of the desert-adapted species that survive in this extreme environment, which features everything from red dunes to deadly [[Dry quicksand|quicksand]].  The climate is mostly dry (the major part receives around 100&amp;nbsp;mm of rain per year but some very rare places receives down to 50&amp;nbsp;mm), and temperatures oscillate between very high heat and seasonal night time freezes.  It is part of the [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] [[biome]] and the [[Palearctic]] [[ecozone]]. 

The Arabian desert [[ecoregion]] holds little [[biodiversity]], although a few endemic plants grow here. Many species, such as the [[striped hyena]], [[jackal]] and [[honey badger]] have become extirpated due to [[hunting]], human encroachment and [[habitat destruction]].  Other species have been successfully re-introduced, such as the sand gazelle, and are protected at a number of reserves.  [[Overgrazing]] by livestock, off-road [[driving]], and human destruction of habitat are the main threats to this desert ecoregion.

* A corridor of sandy terrain known as the [[Ad-Dahna desert]] connects the large [[Nefud|An-Nafud desert]] (65,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 40,389 square miles) in the north of Saudi Arabia to the [[Rub' Al-Khali]] in the south-east.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
* The [[Tuwaiq]] escarpment is a region of {{convert|800|km|mi|abbr=on}} arc of limestone cliffs, plateaux, and canyons.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
* Brackish salt flats: the [[quicksand]]s of [[Umm al Samim]]{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
* The Wahiba sands of [[Oman]]: an isolated sand sea bordering the east coast{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
* The [[Rub' Al-Khali]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=A Lovely World|url=http://www.alovelyworld.com/webyemen/htmgb/yem027.htm |title=Rub Al-Khali, a photo and short description}}&lt;/ref&gt; desert is a [[sedimentary basin]] elongated on a south-west to north-east axis across the Arabian shelf. At an altitude of {{convert|1000|m|ft}}, the rock landscapes yield the place to the [[Rub' al Khali]], vast wide of sand of the Arabian desert, whose extreme southern point crosses the centre of [[Yemen]]. The sand overlies gravel or gypsum plains and the dunes reach maximum heights of up to {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sands are predominantly silicates, composed of 80 to 90% of quartz and the remainder feldspar, whose iron oxide-coated grains color the sands in orange, purple, and red.

==Ecology and natural resources==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
Some of natural resources available in the Arabian Desert are [[oil]], natural [[gas]], [[phosphate]]s, and [[sulfur]].

The Rub'al-Khali has very limited floristic [[biodiversity|diversity]]. There are only 37 plant species, 20 recorded in the main body of the sands and 17 around the outer margins. Among these 37 species, only one or two are endemic. Vegetation is very diffuse but fairly evenly distributed, with some interruptions of near sterile dunes.

Some typical plants are:
* Calligonum crinitum on dune slopes
* Cornulaca arabica (saltbush)
* Cyperus conglomeratus.
Other widespread species are:
* Dipterygium glaucum
* Limeum arabicum
* Zygophyllum mandavillei (Mandaville 1986).
Very little trees may be found except at the outer margin (typically [[Acacia ehrenbergiana]] and [[Prosopis cineraria]]). 

Other species are a woody perennial Calligonum comosum and annual herbs such as Danthonia forskallii

== Climate==
The Arabian Desert has a [[subtropical]], [[hot desert climate]], close to the climate of the [[Sahara Desert]], the world's largest hot desert. In fact, the Arabian Desert is an extension of the Sahara Desert over the Arabian peninsula. The climate is mainly hot and dry with plenty of sunshine throughout the year.
The rainfall amount is generally around 100&amp;nbsp;mm, and the driest areas can receive between 30 and 40&amp;nbsp;mm of annual rain. Such dryness remains very rare throughout the desert, however. There are hardly any [[Wiktionary:hyperarid#English|hyperarid]]
areas in the Arabian Desert, in contrast with the Sahara Desert, where more than half of the area is hyperarid (annual rainfall below 50&amp;nbsp;mm).
The sunshine duration is very high by global standards in the Arabian Desert, between 2,900 hours (66.2% of the daylight hours) and 3,600 hours (82.1% of the daylight hours) but is typically around 3,400 hours (77.6% of the daylight hours), which clearly indicates clear-sky conditions prevails over the region and cloudy periods are just intermittent. Even though the sun and moon is bright, the dust and humidity has a lower visibility for the traveler.
The temperatures remain high all year round. Average high temperatures in summer are generally over 40&amp;nbsp;°C (104&amp;nbsp;°F) at low elevations, and can even soar to 48&amp;nbsp;°C (114.8&amp;nbsp;°F) at extremely low elevations, especially along the Persian Gulf near the sea level. Average low temperatures in summer remain high, over 20&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;°F) and sometimes over 30&amp;nbsp;°C (77&amp;nbsp;°F) in the southernmost regions. Record high temperatures are above 50&amp;nbsp;°C (122&amp;nbsp;°F) in much of the desert, due in part to very low elevation.

==Political borders==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
The desert lies mostly in [[Saudi Arabia]], extending into the surrounding countries of [[Egypt]] ([[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]), southern [[Iraq]] and southern [[Jordan]]. The Arabian desert is bordered by 5 countries. Bordering the [[Persian Gulf]], there is an extension into [[Qatar]] and, further east, the region covers almost all of [[Abu Dhabi]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE). The Rub'al-Khali crosses over from Saudi Arabia into western [[Oman]] and eastern [[Yemen]].

== People, language and cultures ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
The area is home to several different cultures, languages, and peoples, with [[Islam]] as the predominant faith. The major ethnic group in the region is the [[Arab]]s, whose primary language is [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

== Ecological threats ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
* [[Agriculture|Agricultural projects]]
* [[Habitat destruction|Human destruction of habitat]]
* [[War|Military activity]]
* [[Petroleum|Oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] production
* [[Overgrazing]] by camels and goats, with increased herd size, and a more sedentary lifestyle amongst the [[Bedouin]]

===Military activity===
Weaponry used by the United States during the Gulf War also poses a huge risk to the environmental stability of the area. Tank columns in the desert plains may disrupt the fragile stability that exists in the desert currently. In 1991, the movement of US tanks over the desert damaged the top protective layer of the desert soil. As a result, a [[sand]] [[dune]] was released and has started slowly moving downhill.&lt;ref name="media.www.jhunewsletter.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.jhunewsletter.com/media/storage/paper932/news/2003/03/28/Science/Environment.Hit.The.Worst.In.Iraq-2246692.shtml |title=Environment hit the worst in Iraq - Science |website=jhunewsletter.com }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people fear this dune could ultimately reach [[Kuwait City]].&lt;ref name="media.www.jhunewsletter.com"/&gt;

===Conservation===
The conservation status of the desert is critical/endangered, with species including the [[sand gazelle]] and [[white oryx]] threatened, and [[honey badger]]s, [[jackal]]s, and [[striped hyaena]]s already extirpated.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

No formal [[protected areas]] exist, but a number of protected areas are planned for [[Abu Dhabi]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

=== Oil spills ===
{{main|Gulf War oil spill}}
In January 1991 during the [[Gulf War]], Iraqi forces released about 1.7 million m³ (11 million barrels) of oil from storage tanks and tankers directly into the Persian Gulf. In February, they also destroyed 1,164 Kuwaiti oil wells. It took nine months to extinguish these oil fires. These oil spills contaminated {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of Persian Gulf coast.

The result of the pollution was the death of thousands of water birds and serious damage to the Persian Gulf's aquatic [[ecosystem]], particularly [[shrimp]], [[sea turtle]]s, [[dugong]]s, [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[fish]].

The damaged wells also released 10 million m³ (60 million barrels) of oil into the desert and formed lakes (total surface of 49 square kilometers).

The border between [[Bhutan]] and [[China]] is a sinuous line of 470&amp;nbsp;km long, north-south-east direction, which separates [[Bhutan]] to the south from [[Tibet]], an [[autonomous region of China]], to the north. It lies between two [[tripoint]]s formed by the two countries with [[India]]. It is nearby the parallels 28° and 29° N, in the eastern part of the [[Himalayas]].

Bhutan's border with Tibet has never been officially recognised and demarcated. For a brief period, the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] officially maintained a territorial claim on parts of Bhutan.&lt;ref name="ICI"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bt0079) Bhutan - China relations] Accessed 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The territorial claim was maintained by the People's Republic of China after the [[Chinese Communist Party]] took control of mainland China in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. With the increase in soldiers on the Chinese side of the Sino-Bhutanese border after the [[Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet|17-point agreement]] between the local Tibetan government and the central government of the PRC, Bhutan withdrew its representative from [[Lhasa]].&lt;ref name="ICI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VOS"&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JA12Ad02.html In Bhutan, China and India collide] (12 January 2008).

The [[1959 Tibetan Rebellion]] and the [[14th Dalai Lama]]'s arrival in neighbouring ally India made the security of Bhutan's border with China a necessity for Bhutan. An estimated 6,000 Tibetans fled to Bhutan and were granted [[Right of asylum|asylum]], although Bhutan subsequently closed its border to China, fearing more refugees.&lt;ref name="ICI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCO"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/country_profile/54627.stm Bhutan: a land frozen in time] (9 February 1998). BBC. Accessed 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, China and Bhutan signed a bilateral agreement for maintaining peace on the border. In the agreement, China affirmed its respect for Bhutan's sovereignty and territorial integrity and both sides sought to build ties based on the [[Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence]].&lt;ref name="HJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VOS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BG"&gt;[http://bhutangazette.com/2007/06/07/growing-china-bhutan-relations-and-the-changing-strategic-equations-in-south-asia/ Bhutan Gazette]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (7 June 2007).

'''Cold and heat adaptations in humans''' are a part of the broad adaptability of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Adaptations in humans can be [[Physiological adaptations|physiological]], [[Genetics|genetic]], or [[Culture|cultural]], which allow people to live in a wide variety of [[climate]]s. There has been a great deal of research done on developmental adjustment, [[acclimatization]], and cultural practices, but less research on genetic adaptations to cold and heat temperatures.

The human body always works to remain in [[homeostasis]]. One form of homeostasis is [[thermoregulation]]. Body temperature varies in every individual, but the average internal temperature is 37.0&amp;nbsp;°C (98.6&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/767567894|title=Harrison's online|last=1949-|first=Longo, Dan L.

== Origin of cold and heat adaptations ==
Modern humans emerged from Africa approximately 40,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Evidence suggests that modern culture may have originated then, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Richard G.|date=2000-01-01|title=Archeology and the evolution of human behavior|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6505(2000)9:13.0.CO;2-A/abstract|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=17–36|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6505(2000)9:13.0.CO;2-A|issn=1520-6505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern humans spread into Europe and outcompeted [[Neanderthal]]s, which suggests that early modern humans were adaptable enough to live in various climates. This is supported in the variability selection hypothesis proposed by Richard Potts, which says that human adaptability came from environmental change over the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potts|first=Richard|date=1998-01-01|title=Environmental hypotheses of hominin evolution|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(1998)107:27+3.0.CO;2-X/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=107|issue=S27|pages=93–136|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(1998)107:27+3.0.CO;2-X|issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecogeographic rules ===
[[Bergmann's rule|Bergmann’s rule]] states that [[endotherm]]ic animal subspecies living in colder climates have larger bodies than that of the subspecies living in warmer climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Marshall T.|date=1953-08-01|title=The Application of Ecological Rules to the Racial Anthropology of the Aboriginal New World*|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.1953.55.3.02a00020/abstract|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=55|issue=3|pages=311–327|doi=10.1525/aa.1953.55.3.02a00020|issn=1548-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with larger bodies are better suited for colder climates because larger bodies produce more heat due to having more cells, and have a smaller surface area compared to smaller individuals, which reduces heat loss. A study by Frederick Foster and Mark Collard found that Bergmann’s rule can be applied to humans when the latitude and temperature between groups differ widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=Frederick|last2=Collard|first2=Mark|date=2013-08-28|title=A Reassessment of Bergmann's Rule in Modern Humans|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0072269|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=8|pages=e72269|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0072269|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3756069|pmid=24015229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allen's rule|Allen’s rule]] is a biological rule that says the limbs of an endotherm is either shorter in cold climates or longer in hot climates. Limb length affects the body’s surface area, which helps with thermoregulation. Shorter limbs help to conserve heat, while longer limbs help to dissipate heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holliday|first=Trenton W.|last2=Hilton|first2=Charles E.|date=2010-06-01|title=Body proportions of circumpolar peoples as evidenced from skeletal data: Ipiutak and Tigara (Point Hope) versus Kodiak Island Inuit|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.21226/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=142|issue=2|pages=287–302|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21226|issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall T. Newman argues that this can be observed in [[Eskimo]], who have shorter limbs than other people and are laterally built.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Marshall T.|date=1961-06-01|title=Biological Adaptation of Man to His Environment: Heat, Cold, Altitude, and Nutrition|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1961.tb31093.x/abstract|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=91|issue=3|pages=617–633|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1961.tb31093.x|issn=1749-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiological adaptations ==
{{main|Thermoregulation in humans}}
Ambient air temperature affects how much energy investment the human body must make. The temperature that requires the least amount of energy investment is 21&amp;nbsp;°C (69.8&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The body controls its temperature through the [[hypothalamus]]. [[Thermoreceptor]]s in the skin send signals to the hypothalamus, which indicate when [[vasodilation]] and [[vasoconstriction]] should occur.

=== Cold ===
The human body has two methods of [[thermogenesis]], which produces heat to raise the core body temperature. The first is [[shivering]], which occurs in an unclothed person when the ambient air temperature is under 25&amp;nbsp;°C (77&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26763611|title=Human adaptation and accommodation|last=1939-|first=Frisancho, A. Roberto,|date=1993-01-01|publisher=University of Michigan Press|oclc=26763611}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is limited by the amount of [[glycogen]] available in the body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The second is non-shivering, which occurs in [[brown adipose tissue]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19890013690.pdf|title=Acclimatization to cold in humans|last=Kaciuba-Uscilko|first=Hannah|last2=Greenleaf|first2=John|date=April 1, 1989|website=ntrs.nasa.gov/|publisher=United States|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heat ===
The only mechanism the human body has to cool itself is by [[Perspiration|sweat]] [[evaporation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sweating occurs when the ambient air temperatures is above 28&amp;nbsp;°C (82&amp;nbsp;°F) and the body fails to return to the normal internal temperature.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The evaporation of the sweat helps cool the blood beneath the skin. It is limited by the amount of water available in the body, which can cause dehydration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Acclimatization ===
When humans are exposed to certain climates for extended periods of time, physiological changes occur to help the individual adapt to hot or cold climates. This helps the body conserve energy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Cold ====
The [[Inuit]] have more blood flowing into their extremities, and at a hotter temperature, than people living in warmer climates. A 1960 study on the [[Alacalufe people|Alacaluf Indians]] shows that they have a resting metabolic rate 150 to 200 percent higher than the white controls used. [[Sami people|Lapps]] do not have an increase in metabolic rate when sleeping, unlike non-acclimated people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian aborigines]] undergo a similar process, where the body cools but the metabolic rate does not increase.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Heat ====
Humans in Central Africa have been living in similar tropical climates for at least 40,000 years, which means that they have similar thermoregulatory systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A study done on the [[Bantu peoples|Bantus]] of South Africa showed that Bantus have a lower sweat rate than that of acclimated and nonacclimated whites. A similar study done on Australian aborigines produced similar results, with aborigines having a much lower sweat rate than whites.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Culture ==
Social adaptations enabled early modern humans to occupy environments with temperatures that were drastically different from that of Africa. (Potts 1998). Culture enabled humans to expand their range to areas that would otherwise be uninhabitable.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Cold ===
Humans have been able to occupy areas of extreme cold through clothing, buildings, and manipulation of fire. [[Furnace]]s have further enabled the occupation of cold environments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Australian aborigines only wear genital coverings for clothes, but studies have shown that the warmth from the fires they build is enough to keep the body from fighting heat loss through shivering.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Eskimos use well-insulated houses that are designed to transfer heat from an energy source to the living area, which means that the average indoor temperature for coastal Eskimos is 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;°C (50-68&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Heat ===
Humans inhabit hot climates, both dry and [[Humidity|humid]], and have done so for thousands of years. Selective use of clothing and technological inventions such as [[air conditioning]] allows humans to thrive in hot climates.

One example is the [[Bedouin|Chaamba Arabs]], who live in the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]]. They wear clothing that traps air in between skin and the clothes, preventing the high ambient air temperature from reaching the skin.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Genetic adaptations ==
There has been very little research done in the genetics behind adaptations to heat and cold stress. Data suggests that certain parts of the [[human genome]] have only been [[Natural selection|selected]] for recently. Research on gene-culture interaction has been successful in linking agriculture and [[lactose]] tolerance. However, most evidence of links between culture and selection has not been proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laland|first=Kevin N.|last2=Odling-Smee|first2=John|last3=Myles|first3=Sean|title=How culture shaped the human genome: bringing genetics and the human sciences together|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrg2734|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=11|issue=2|pages=137–148|doi=10.1038/nrg2734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yale University Press. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In history, a '''colony''' is a [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] under the immediate complete political control of a [[Sovereign state|state]], distinct from the home territory of the sovereign. For [[colonies in antiquity]], [[city-state]]s would often found their own colonies. Some colonies were historically countries, while others were territories without definite statehood from their inception.

The '''metropolitan state''' is the state that rules the colony. In [[Ancient Greece]], the city that founded a colony was known as the [[metropolis]]. "Mother country" is a reference to the metropolitan state from the point of view of citizens who live in its colony. There is a [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]].

Unlike a [[puppet state]] or [[satellite state]], a colony has no independent international representation, and its top-level administration is under direct control of the metropolitan state.

The term ''informal colony'' is used by some historians to refer to a country under the ''[[de facto]]'' control of another state, although this term is often contentious.

==Definitions==
The word "colony" comes from the Latin word ''colōnia''. This in turn derives from the word ''[[Colonus (person)|colōnus]]'', which means colonist but also implies a [[farmer]]. [[Cologne]] is an example of a settlement preserving this etymology. Other, less obvious settlements that began as Roman [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]] include cities from [[Belgrade]] to [[York]]. A tell-tale sign of a settlement once being a Roman colony is a city centre with a grid pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James S. Jeffers|title=The Greco-Roman world of the New Testament era: exploring the background of early Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGmKaXiUDiYC|year=1999|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-1589-0|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YGmKaXiUDiYC&amp;pg=PA52 52–53]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology is taken from architectural analogy, where a column pillar is beneath the (often stylized) head [[Capital (architecture)|capital]], which is also a biological analog of the body as subservient beneath the controlling head (with 'capital' coming from the Latin word ''caput'', meaning 'head'). So colonies are not independently self-controlled, but rather are controlled from a separate entity that serves the capital function.

Roman colonies first appeared when the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] conquered neighbouring [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic peoples]]. These were small farming settlements that appeared when the Romans had subdued an enemy in war. A colony could take many forms, as a trade outpost or a military base in enemy territory. Its original definition as a settlement created by people migrating from a central region to an outlying one became the modern definition.

* '''{{flag|Sri Lanka}}''': a British colony from 1815 to 1948. Known as [[Ceylon]]. Was a [[British Dominion]] until 1972. Also a [[Portuguese Ceylon|Portuguese colony]] in the 16th-17th centuries, and a [[Dutch Ceylon|Dutch colony]] in the 17th-18th centuries.
* '''{{flag|Taiwan}}''' had a [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch colony]] (1624–1662) centered on present-day Tainan; shortly afterwards, a [[Spanish Formosa|Spanish colony]] (1626–1642) was established concurrently in northern Taiwan, not far from present-day Taipei.&lt;ref name="gutenberg-e.org"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg-e.org/andrade/conclusion.html Tonio Andrade, How Taiwan Became Chinese: Dutch, Spanish, and Han Colonization in the Seventeenth Century, Columbia University Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kingdom of Tungning|Chinese colonial rule]] was established when Han Chinese forces loyal to the Ming Dynasty defeated the Dutch in 1662.&lt;ref name="gutenberg-e.org"/&gt; The Ming loyalists later surrendered Taiwan to the Qing Dynasty, which annexed Taiwan into Chinese territory, making it part of Fujian province, and later making it a province in its own right. [[Taiwan under Qing Dynasty rule|Qing dynasty rule]] ended after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] when the Qing ceded Taiwan to Japan, placing Taiwan under [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese control]] (1895-1945). After the defeat of Japan in [[World War II]], Taiwan was given to the [[Government of the Republic of China|Republic of China]], becoming its base after its defeat in the [[Chinese civil war]].
* The '''{{flag|United States}}''' was formed from a union of thirteen distinct British [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]]. The [[Colony of Virginia]] was the first of the thirteen colonies. All thirteen declared independence in July 1776 and expelled the British governors.

==Current colonies==
The [[Special Committee on Decolonization]] maintains the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]], which identifies areas the United Nations (though not without controversy) believes are colonies. Given that [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] have varying degrees of autonomy and political power in the affairs of the controlling state, there is disagreement over the classification of "colony".

[[Schiehallion]], a mountain in [[Perthshire]], is sometimes described as the centre of [[Scotland]].

However, 2002 studies by the [[Ordnance Survey]] pinpointed the centres more precisely, and it is their results that are quoted here. However, this is obviously dependent on whether or not Scotland's islands are included, and there is more than one way to measure it.

==Elevation extremes==

*Scotland: [[Ben Nevis]] (1,345&amp;nbsp;metres)

The ten tallest [[mountain]]s in the UK are all found in Scotland.

[[Wanlockhead]] claims to be the highest settlement in Scotland.

Many points are on, or near sea level, but due to high rainfall, there are no natural dry pieces of land below sea level - see rivers and lochs below.

==Rivers and lochs==
[[Image:Loch Morar.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Loch Morar]]
;Main articles:
*[[List of lochs in Scotland]];
*[[Rivers of Scotland]];

The longest river in Scotland is the [[River Tay]] (117&amp;nbsp;mi, 188&amp;nbsp;km).

The largest (freshwater) loch in Scotland is: 
*Scotland: [[Loch Lomond]] (27.46&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi, 71.12&amp;nbsp;km²)

The deepest freshwater loch is [[Loch Morar]] with a maximum depth of 309&amp;nbsp;metres ([[Loch Ness]] is second at 228&amp;nbsp;metres deep).

==Notes about Rockall==
[[Rockall]] is claimed by several countries, including the UK (as part of Scotland's [[Outer Hebrides]]).

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; If Rockall is not considered part of the UK, [[Soay, Saint Kilda|Soay]], [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]], west of the [[Outer Hebrides]], is the westernmost point.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;The village on [[Hirta]], [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]] was abandoned in 1930, and was until then the westernmost settlement in Scotland. The island now has a military base, and is staffed during the summer months.

[[File:Vista de los Andes, Abancay, Perú, 2015-07-30, DD 68.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Andes Mountains in Peru]]

==Geological history, stratigraphy &amp; tectonics==
The oldest rocks in Peru date to the [[Precambrian]] and are more than two billion years old. Along the southern coast, [[granulite]] and [[charnockite]] shows reworking by an ancient orogeny mountain building event. Situated close to the Peru-Chile Trench, these rocks have anomalously high strontium isotope ratios, which suggest recent calc-alkaline volcanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/198/4312/49|title=Two-Billion-Year Granulites in the Late Precambrian Metamorphic Basement Along the Southern Peruvian Coast|first1=B.|last1=Dalmayrac|first2=J. R.|last2=Lancelot|first3=A.|last3=Leyreloup|date=7 October 1977|publisher=|journal=Science|volume=198|issue=4312|pages=49–51|via=science.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/science.198.4312.49|pmid=17741896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Eastern Cordillera of Peru, Precambrian magmatism in the Huanaco region produced ultramafic, mafic and felsic rocks, including serpentinite, meta-diorite, meta-gabbro, meta-tonalite and diorite and granite that intruded after the first phase of orogenic tectonic activity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.periodicos.usp.br/bigusp/article/view/45241/48853|title=Vista do  The Upper Precambrian of South America|website=www.periodicos.usp.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grenville orogeny]] had a major impact in Peru. The basement of the Central Andean orogeny includes the rocks of the Arequipa Massif, which reach [[granulite]] grade on the sequence of [[metamorphic facies]] and formed around 1.9 billion years ago. Zircon grains in these rocks match those in Labrador, Greenland and Scotland, indicating that much of western South America originated as a promontory of the proto-North American continent [[Laurentia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012821X9500055H|title=Grenvillian granulite-facies metamorphism in the Arequipa Massif, Peru: a Laurentia-Gondwana link|date=1 May 1995|publisher=|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=132|issue=1-4|pages=63–73|via=www.sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1016/0012-821X(95)00055-H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)===
In the [[Paleozoic]], Peru was on the western margin of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]]. Analysis of [[Ordovician]] and [[Devonian]] sandstones in the Eastern Cordillera (spanning into Bolivia) indicates eroded [[zircon]] grains formed to the east in Brazil during the Brasiliano orogeny. By contrast, Altiplano and Coastal Cordillera sandstones seem to have originated from the Arequipa Massif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1342937X10000304|title=Geodynamic evolution of the early Paleozoic Western Gondwana margin 14°–17°S reflected by the detritus of the Devonian and Ordovician basins of southern Peru and northern Bolivia|date=1 September 2010|publisher=|journal=[[Gondwana Research]] |volume=18|issue=2-3|pages=370–384|via=www.sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1016/j.gr.2010.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plutonic and volcanic rocks in the Inner Arc domain (later uplifted in the Central Andean orogeny) include the high-grade, low-pressure metamorphic gabbro-granite of the San Gaban Complex and early [[Permian]] Mitu Group  alkali basalts. Rocks, such as those in the Mitu Group, formed during pulses of magmatism in back-arc basins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:23095|title=Reconstructing the Late Paleozoic : Early Mesozoic plutonic and sedimentary record of south-east Peru : Orphaned back-arcs along the western margin of Gondwana|first=Reitsma, Martje|last=Jel|date=9 November 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/089598119090004K|title=Late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic magmatism in the Cordillera de Carabaya, Puno, southeastern Peru: Geochronology and petrochemistry|date=1 January 1990|publisher=|journal=Journal of South American Earth Sciences|volume=3|issue=4|pages=213–230|via=www.sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1016/0895-9811(90)90004-K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of central North America were adjacent to western South America during the late Paleozoic, helping to drive folding and metamorphism. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/7/1/41/195511|title=Late Paleozoic collision of North and South America|first=Charles A.|last=Ross|date=9 November 1979|publisher=|journal=Geology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=41|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1979)7&lt;41:LPCONA&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The region was affected by the [[Hercynian orogeny]] from 550 to 220 million years ago, leading to [[granitoid]] intrusion, nepheline syenite, syntectonic granites and calc-alkaline volcanism. 

Along the coast, subduction produced basins on land and volcanic activity, that resulted in the two kilometer thick Yamayo Group and the overlying one to six kilometer volcanic and volcaniclastic Yura Group.

===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
The [[Andean orogeny]] began in the late [[Triassic]]. In the south, the two kilometer Chocolate Formation formed with sedimentary rocks into the late Triassic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981113000916|title=Late Paleozoic to Jurassic chronostratigraphy of coastal southern Peru: Temporal evolution of sedimentation along an active margin|date=1 November 2013|publisher=|journal=Journal of South American Earth Sciences|volume=47|pages=179–200|via=www.sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1016/j.jsames.2013.07.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central Peru experienced less magmatic activity than during the Hercynian orogeny, but acid plutonic rocks emplaced in the center of the country. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001282528290040X|title=Present knowledge of the magmatic evolution of the Eastern Cordillera of Peru|date=1 November 1982|publisher=|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=18|issue=3-4|pages=253–283|via=www.sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1016/0012-8252(82)90040-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pucara Basin subsided on the landward side of a structural high from the Triassic into the early Jurassic. The basin filled first with carbonates and then with [[argillite]] followed by shallow water carbonates. Some carbonates were later transformed to [[dolomite]] and the basin's rocks show signs of Mississippi Valley Type lead-zinc mineralization, common in basin-forming shear zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981107000399|title=Tectonic evolution and paleogeography of the Mesozoic Pucará Basin, central Peru|date=1 June 2007|publisher=|journal=Journal of South American Earth Sciences|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–24|via=www.sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1016/j.jsames.2007.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of Puno-Santa Lucia, which was slowly being uplifted as the Andes, two kilometer Paleozoic Cabanillas Group quartzite and shale is overlain by the 1.5 kilometer [[Jurassic]] Lagunillas Group. The Huancane and Moho groups include [[red beds]] and limestone, formed in closed basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://archives.datapages.com/data/bulletns/1974-76/data/pg/0058/0006/0950/0982.htm?doi=10.1306/83D915E7-16C7-11D7-8645000102C1865D|title=Mesozoic and Cenozoic Stratigraphy and Tectonic Events of Puno-Santa Lucia Area, Department of Puno, Peru|first=|last=Jorge A.

The 1600 kilometer Coastal Batholith of Peru formed in an ensialic marginal basin in the early [[Cretaceous]], with the emplacement of pillow lavas, gabbro and volcaniclastic rocks. In the north, it formed as new continental crust with no older continental crust beneath it, while to the south it spans thick Precambrian rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-7335-3_12|title=Andean Magmatism|first=M.

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
As the Andean orogeny accelerated from the [[Albian]], rock deformation shifted toward the Amazonian foredeep. The [[Marañón fold and thrust belt]] formed in the [[Eocene]], bounding the Western Cordillera. Crustal shortening produced a [[sialic]] root to the Andes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jgs.lyellcollection.org/content/141/5/893|title=The Andean orogenic period and its major structures in central and northern Peru|first=F.|last=Mégard|date=1 September 1984|publisher=|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|volume=141|issue=5|pages=893–900|via=jgs.lyellcollection.org|doi=10.1144/gsjgs.141.5.0893}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-abstract/102/8/1105/182474|title=Cenozoic stratigraphy, magmatic activity, compressive deformation, and uplift in northern Peru|first1=DONALD C.|last1=NOBLE|first2=EDWIN H.|last2=McKEE|first3=THOMAS|last3=MOURIER|first4=FRANÇOIS|last4=MÉGARD|date=1 August 1990|publisher=|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|volume=102|issue=8|pages=1105–1113|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1990)102&lt;1105:CSMACD&gt;2.3.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-abstract/95/11/1318/189432|title=Cenozoic polyphase landscape and tectonic evolution of the Cordillera Occidental, southernmost Peru|first1=RICHARD M.|last1=TOSDAL|first2=ALAN H.|last2=CLARK|first3=EDWARD|last3=FARRAR|date=9 November 1984|publisher=|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|volume=95|issue=11|pages=1318|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1984)95&lt;1318:CPLATE&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=i_aIxUnh53QC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA469&amp;dq=cenozoic+peru&amp;ots=J8DjRUJM-G&amp;sig=563lQ-J6GG5eK5kn0dNM0wlsAQk#v=onepage&amp;q=cenozoic+peru&amp;f=false|title=Nazca Plate: Crustal Formation and Andean Convergence : a Volume Dedicated to George P.

Marine transgressions swept the region starting in the Eocene, emplacing conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and diatomite in the Sechura Basin and Pisco Basin—a pair of forearc basins in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003101829090179B|title=Cenozoic marine sedimentation in the Sechura and Pisco basins, Peru|date=1 April 1990|publisher=|journal=[[Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology]]| volume=77|issue=3-4|pages=235–261|via=www.sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1016/0031-0182(90)90179-B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Miocene]]-aged [[Cordillera Blanca Batholith]] intrudes the [[Coastal Batholith of Peru|Coastal Batholith]] over 50 kilometer thick crust, with S-type peraluminous granites produced by deformation and uplift. The majority of rocks in the batholith are high-sodium, high-silica I-type granites, with characteristics that have been interpreted as subducted oceanic crust melts. However, it does not have positioning consistent with subduction and geologists have interpreted it as underplating leading to partial melting, the formation of [[Trondhjemite|trondhjemitic]] magmas rich in clinopyroxene, garnet and amphibole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/petrology/article/37/6/1491/1406641|title=Na-rich Partial Melts from Newly Underplated Basaltic Crust: the Cordillera Blanca Batholith, Peru|first1=NICK|last1=PETFORD|first2=MICHAEL|last2=ATHERTON|date=9 November 1996|publisher=|journal=Journal of Petrology|volume=37|issue=6|pages=1491–1521|doi=10.1093/petrology/37.6.1491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intense volcanism, deformation and plutonism was common in the Miocene and [[Pliocene]] in central Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012821X74900570|title=Episodic Cenozoic volcanism and tectonism in the Andes of Peru|date=1 January 1974|publisher=|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=21|issue=2|pages=213–220|via=www.sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1016/0012-821X(74)90057-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerlachovský štít''' ({{Audio|Sk-Gerlachovsky stit.ogg|Slovak pronunciation}}, translated into English as ''Gerlachov Peak''), informally referred to as '''Gerlach''', is the highest peak in the [[High Tatras]], in [[Slovakia]], and in the whole {{convert|1,500|km|mi|abbr=on}} long [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] mountain chain.

Usually listed at 2,655&amp;nbsp;metres [[AMSL]] (8,711&amp;nbsp;ft), its exact elevation is actually {{convert|0.6|m|ft|abbr=off}} lower.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The pyramidal shape of the massif is marked by a huge [[cirque]]. Despite its relatively low elevation, the about 2,000&amp;nbsp;m vertical rise from the valley floor makes Gerlachovský štít soar.&lt;ref name="summitpost"&gt;{{cite summitpost|id=150749|title=Gerlachovsky Stit|accessdate=3 June 2007|date=27 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mistaken for an average mountain in the rugged [[High Tatras]] range in the more distant past, it has since played a symbolic role in the eyes of the rulers and populations of several Central European nations, to the point that between the 19th and mid-20th century, it had four different names with six name reversals. It managed to be the highest mountain of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], and of the countries of [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Slovakia]] and then Czechoslovakia again within the span of less than three decades of the 20th century.

Gerlachovský štít shares its geology and ecology with the rest of the [[Tatra Mountains|High Tatras]], but provides a worthwhile environment for biologists as the highest ground anywhere in Europe north of the parallel linking approximately [[Munich]], Salzburg, and [[Vienna]]. With the travel restrictions imposed by the [[Eastern Bloc]], the mountain was particularly treasured as the loftiest point available to climb to by Czechs, East Germans, Hungarians, Poles, and Slovaks. It continues to attract its share of visitors although the local authorities have been continually adding new restrictions on access.

== Names ==

=== Present ===
Gerlachovský štít means the "Peak (of the village) of [[Gerlachov, Poprad District|Gerlachov]]". The [[Slovak language|Slovak]] colloquial (unofficial) name is ''Gerlach''. The [[Polish language|Polish]] official names are ''Gerlach'' or ''Gierlach'', while its [[Polish language|Polish]] colloquial names are ''Girlach'' and ''Garłuch.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurnik.pl/slownik/sp.phtml?sl=Gar%B3uch|title=Anna Kłosińska, ''Słownik ortograficzny,''|year=2004|accessdate=15 November 2007|language=Polish}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyklopedia.interia.pl/obiekty/cc.html?hid=71667 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708130425/http://encyklopedia.interia.pl/obiekty/cc.html?hid=71667 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-08 |title=GERLACH |work=Encyklopedia Internautica |date=n.d. |accessdate=15 November 2007 |language=Polish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ivan Bohuš 1996"&gt;Ivan Bohuš, ''Od A po Z o názvoch Vysokých Tatier'', 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the village of Gerlachov itself is of [[German people|German]] origin, because the [[Spiš]] region around the High Tatra Mountains in Slovakia used to be inhabited by German settlers for several centuries.

=== Past ===
The peak's earliest recorded name was the [[Szepes County|Szepes]]-[[Carpathian Germans|German]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Slovak Academy of Sciences in Košice|url = http://www.saske.sk/cas/archiv/4-2002/olejnik-st.html|title="Impact of external factors upon the formation of ethnicity – the case of German community living in the region of Zips (Slovak Republic)."

Comitat Scepusiensis.'' Engraved by Friedrich Hampe, 1762.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118165246/http://www.zwoje-scrolls.com/tn_gd/G70_1.jpg |date=18 January 2006 }} In: Józef Szlafarski, ''Poznanie Tatr'', 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The Slovak name of the mountain was first recorded as ''Kotol'', also meaning "Cauldron", in 1821.&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Meltzer, "Das Zipser Comitat." In: Johannes Csaplovics, ''Topographisch-statistisches Archiv des Königreiches Ungarn'', 1821.&lt;/ref&gt; Both names referred to the peak's characteristic cauldron-like [[cirque]].

The name that became common in travel books and other literature in the 19th century, however, is its current name, linking the mountain to the village of [[Gerlachov, Poprad District|Gerlachov]] at its foot.&lt;ref&gt;For instance: Alexander F. Heksch, ''Führer durch die Karpathen und oberungarischen Badeorte.'' 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; It echoed the oldest known undifferentiated reference to the peaks on or near Gerlachov's municipal lands, ''Gerlachfalvenses montes'' (Latin with Hungarian elements for the "Gerlachov Village Mountains"), in a drawing of the High Tatras from 1717.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Buchholtz Jr., ''Delineatio Nomenclatura Montium Carpathicorum, qualiter sese Lomnitzæ conspiciendi sistunt.'' 1717. In: Ivan Houdek, ''Osudy Vysokých Tatier.'' 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; It also paralleled the name ''Gerlsdorfer Spitze'' (Gerlachov Peak)&lt;ref name="Ludwig Greiner 1839"&gt;Ludwig Greiner, "Die Gerlsdorfer Spitze als die höchste Gebirgshöhe der Karpathen." ''Gemeinnützige Blaetter zur Belehrung und Unterhaltung'', 1839.&lt;/ref&gt; used by [[Gerlachovský štít#History|the first person to identify it]] as the highest peak in the Tatras in 1838 (see below), which was rendered as ''gerlachovský chochol'' (Gerlach crest) in a Slovak version of his report in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;L. Greiner, "Gerlachovský chochol, jako nejvyšší jehlan v Tatrách." ''Slovenské noviny'', November 1851.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other mountains in the High Tatras have acquired their names from villages in the foothills.

Once it was determined that the mountain was the highest point in the region, the succession of the authorities that held control over it took an interest in its name and changed it periodically for symbolic reasons. In 1896, as part of [[Austria-Hungary]], the highest peak of the Carpathians received its first government-sponsored name − after the contemporary head of state Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I]].&lt;ref name="tatry.info"/&gt; Guidebooks sometimes did not catch up on these name changes.&lt;ref&gt;For instance: Karel Drož, ''Tatry.'' 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; After the dissolution of the monarchy in 1918, the mountain continued to be known simply as ''Gerlachovský štít'' because it belonged to the village of [[Gerlachov, Poprad District|Gerlachov]]. The Polish government, claiming the territory of the [[High Tatras]] for Poland, simultaneously called the mountain ''Szczyt Polski'' (Polish Peak), but never gained control over it.&lt;ref name="tatry.info"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Mikuláš Argalács and Dominik Michalík |url=http://www.vysoke-tatry.info/vyklad.php?tatry=121 |language=Slovak |title=Gerlachovský štít |year=2003 |accessdate=3 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109205147/http://www.vysoke-tatry.info/vyklad.php?tatry=121 |archivedate=9 November 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] government changed the name to ''Štít legionárov'' (Legionnaires Peak) in honor of the [[Czechoslovak Legions]] in 1923, but the name was dropped in favor of the earlier ''Gerlachovský štít'' in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Foreign Ministry of the Czech Republic | url = http://www.mzv.cz/wwwo/default.asp?id=40147&amp;ido16836&amp;idj=1&amp;amb=3&amp;ParentIDO | title = Baron Adrien de Gerlache: Víte co má nejslavnější belgický polárník společného s nejvyšší horou Vysokých Tater? | year = 2005 | accessdate = 16 November 2007 | language = Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the Communist coup d'état in 1948, the mountain was renamed once more − to ''Stalinov štít'' ([[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] Peak) in 1949.&lt;ref name="Ivan Bohuš 1996"/&gt; Its traditional name ''Gerlachovský štít'' was restored yet again a decade later and has remained unchanged through the present.

== History ==
[[Image:Tupa Koncista and Gerlachovsky stit.jpg|thumb|right|Gerlachovský štít (right) with its huge cirque]]
Gerlachovský štít was not always considered the highest mountain in the Tatras. After the first official measurement of peaks in the Tatras during the period of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in the 18th century, [[Kriváň (peak)|Kriváň]] (2,494&amp;nbsp;m) was considered the highest. Other candidate peaks for the status of the highest mountain at that time were [[Lomnický štít]] (2,633&amp;nbsp;m) and Ľadový štít (2,627&amp;nbsp;m). The first person to accurately name Gerlachovský štít as the highest peak was the forester [[Ludwig Greiner|Ľudovít (Ludwig) Greiner]] in 1838.&lt;ref name="Ludwig Greiner 1839"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesy.sk/files/lesnik/2006/Lesnik%205_2006/Ludovit_Greiner.htm źudovít Greiner&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesy.sk/showdoc.do?docid=2210 Pamätná izba Ľudovíta Greinera v Revúcej&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Greiner's measurement was formally confirmed by an Austrian Army survey party in 1868. However, it was generally accepted only after the Vienna Military Institute for Geography issued a new, authoritative collection of maps of Central Europe in ca. 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Lesy SR (Forests of the Slovak Republic) | url = http://www.lesy.sk/files/lesnik/2006/Lesnik%205_2006/Ludovit_Greiner.htm | title = Ľudovít Greiner | author=Július Burkovský and Igor Viszlai | date = 6 October 2006 |accessdate = 3 June 2007| language = Slovak }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Contrary to its title, it actually contained 14 plates: Josef Schlacher, ''General-Karte von Mittel-Europa. In 12 Blättern.'' ca. 1875.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first confirmed ascent was made by Ján (Johann) Still from the village of [[Nová Lesná]] in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novalesna.sk/2004/08/jan-johann-still/ Ján (Johann) Still | Nová Lesná&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, the routes through the ''Velická próba'' (Velická Challenge) and ''Batizovská próba'' (Batizovská Challenge) were secured by chains.

== Access ==
[[Image:Altaj Tatroj Gerlach.JPG|thumb|right|Gerlachovský štít seen from Velická Valley]]

Only members of a national [[Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme|UIAA]] club are allowed to climb the peak on their own. Other visitors have to take a certified mountain guide. The two easiest routes, usually up the ''Velická próba'' and down the ''Batizovská próba'' named after their respective valleys, are protected by chains. Because of an exposed section along the ''Velická próba'' and tricky orientation especially on the ridge, both are among the more difficult [[scrambling]] routes in the High Tatras, although it's rather climbing, since there are many moments when one must rely on ones hands to hold ones bodyweight.&lt;ref name="tatry.nfo.sk"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=tatry.nfo.sk | url = http://www.tatry.nfo.sk/vthse.php | language=Slovak | title = Menu on the left – Gerlachovský štít | date = n.d. |accessdate = 3 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; With no snow, guidebooks [[Grade (climbing)|grade]] the routes as a II or III climb ([[Grade (climbing)|UIAA scale]])&lt;ref name="summitpost"/&gt; or lower.&lt;ref&gt;Július Andráši and Arno Andráši, ''Tatranské vrcholy: Vysokohorský sprievodca.'' 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The total elevation gain is about {{convert|1,000|m|ft|abbr=on}} for those who spend the night at the Sliezsky Dom Hotel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://accommodation.travelslovakia.sk/hotel-sliezsky-dom-tatranska-polianka.php?accommodation=sliezsky_dom|title=Mountain Hotel Sliezsky Dom|work=travelslovakia.sk|accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or are driven there by a mountain guide, and about {{convert|1,665|m|ft|abbr=on}} for those who hike from [[Vysoké Tatry (town)|Tatranská Polianka]]. In winter, Gerlachovský štít offers a challenging alpine climb, with mixed climbing and a risk of avalanches.&lt;ref name="summitpost"/&gt;

The unmarked trailhead is on the green-marked trail leading up Velická Valley near the southern edge of the first plateau (Kvetnica) above the Sliezsky Dom. The equally unmarked, indistinct route to Gerlach veers off north-west towards the mountain's eastern slopes at the elevation of ca. {{convert|1,815|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but occasional cairns begin to appear farther on. The fastest and easiest descent is down the ''Batizovská próba.''&lt;ref name="tatry.nfo.sk"/&gt; Mountain guides always follow the route in the east-west direction, ascending from Velická Valley and descending into Batizovská Valley, in order to reduce logjams.

Two most popular multi-pitch routes for technical climbing are on the eastern and south-western walls.&lt;ref name="tatry.nfo.sk"/&gt; Both are exceptionally long and situated on solid [[granite]] walls. The best season for climbing is mid September to mid October or until the snow falls.&lt;ref name="summitpost"/&gt; Another good season lasts from late June to early August.

The route to Gerlachovský štít falls under the [[Tatra National Park, Slovakia|Tatra National Park]] ordinance, according to which hikers who depart from marked trails may be subject to fines unless they are [[UIAA]] members, or are led by an [[UIAGM|IFMGA]]-certified mountain guide. Camping is subject to similar restrictions. Rangers and some mountain guides are authorized to collect fines on the spot. Cairns that hikers build to mark the trailhead are periodically taken apart.

== Conditions at the summit ==

=== Human response ===
Although authors estimate that at least some of the manifestations of [[altitude sickness]] may appear at elevations as low as {{convert|1,500|–|2,400|m|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Brundrett, "Sickness at high altitude: a literature review." ''Journal of the Royal Society of Health'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  it has not been reported in the Tatras. Low air pressure begins to have marginal but detectable effects at the summit ({{convert|2654.4|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=x|; }}). Water boils at about {{convert|91.5|°C|°F|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Hospitality Institute of Technology and Management St. Paul, Minnesota, USA|url=http://www.hi-tm.com/Documents/Calib-boil.html#tables|title=Boiling point / Atmospheric pressure / Altitude tables.|author=O. Peter Snyder Jr.|year=2002|accessdate=20 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arterial [[oxygen saturation]] is about 8% lower than at most visitors' places of residence,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Houston, ''High Altitude: Illness and Wellness.'' 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is difficult to distinguish slight oxygen deprivation at the summit from fatigue caused by the exertion required to reach it. Authors speak of possible minimal sensory impairment above {{convert|1,500|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Unlike fitness, age in itself is not a determinant factor in reaching the highest point in the Tatras. The famed Tatra guide Ján Počúvaj took clients to the summit of Gerlach until the age of 76.&lt;ref&gt;Václav Cibula, "Šestsetkrát na vrcholu." ''Krásy domova'', 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== View ===
Like a 19th-century comment in a British guidebook, "impressive and picturesque",&lt;ref&gt;Karl Baedeker, ''Austria, Including Hungary, Transylvania, Dalmatia, and Bosnia.'' 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; modern hikers usually appreciate the panoramic view of the highest and many other peaks in the High Tatras, from [[Kriváň (peak)|Kriváň]] in the west to Široká in the north and [[Lomnický štít]] in the east. Farther on, but often visible, are the eastern [[Low Tatras]] in the south and part of the [[Belianske Tatras]] in the east. Better than usual visibility, a rare occurrence except in the fall and winter, is needed to see the Stolické vrchy, Volovské vrchy, the [[Slovak Paradise National Park|Slovak Paradise]] region, and [[Branisko (mountain range)|Branisko]]. Quite exceptionally, visibility may extend to the [[Eastern Alps|Austrian Alps]] and the Polish–Czech [[Karkonosze|Giant Mountains]] hundreds of miles away.&lt;ref&gt;For instance: (eb), "Babie leto je slávnejšie ako Medard." ''Korzár'', 21 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hikers' reported enjoyment of the view is at least partly attributable to their awareness that they are at the highest point in all of northern and central Europe (Visegrád countries). Visibility is merely {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} or less on most summer afternoons because of the amount of water vapor in the air or because of cloudiness (fog). Days with afternoon visibility of {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} or more are common only later in the fall and in winter.&lt;ref&gt;Jadwiga Orliczowa and Vladimír Peterka, "Dohľadnosť." In: Mikuláš Konček, et al. ''Klíma Tatier.'' 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; The view is partly blocked by the long ridge of Končistá in the west, areas near the mountain towards the south and north are obscured by the Gerlach massif itself. Several other summits in the High Tatras, including some with marked trails, offer views with precipitous drops, varied scenery, and wide vistas.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimír Adamec, ''Slovensko: 69 vyhliadkových vrcholov.'' 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weather ===
[[Image:Dolina bialej wody.JPG|thumb|right|Gerlachovský štít (left) viewed from Bielovodská Valley]]
The effects of high-altitude weather on those who ascend Gerlachovský štít may be more pronounced than its altitude alone. The [[temperature gradient]] between the Tatra mountain resorts ({{convert|900|-|1,350|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and the summit can be steep.&lt;ref&gt;Miluláš Konček and Michał Orlicz, "Teplotné pomery." In: Mikuláš Konček, et al. ''Klíma Tatier.'' 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Low air temperature higher up can be masked by high [[insolation]] under clear skies, but will take its effect with increased cloud cover.&lt;ref&gt;František Smolen and Mieczysław Kołodziejek, "Žiarenie." In: Mikuláš Konček, et al. ''Klíma Tatier.'' 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with windy conditions, the impact may be considerably detrimental even without rain or snow. The summit disappears in the clouds for periods of time on most days,&lt;ref&gt;Jadwiga Orliczowa and Vladimír Peterka, "Oblačnosť a slnečný svit." In: Mikuláš Konček, et al. ''Klíma Tatier.'' 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; which translates to fog at that elevation and possible disorientation&lt;ref&gt;Stanislav Samuhel, "Je výstup na Gerlach nebezpečný?" ''Krásy Slovenska'', 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as anxiety.

While temperatures are somewhat lower on Gerlachovský štít because of its elevation, the weather and its potential impact on visitors is little different from other summits in the High Tatras both with and without marked trails. The typical daily weather pattern in the summer is a clear morning, clouds gathering by mid-morning—noon, occasional showers and storms in the afternoon. The chance of rain is lowest between 9–10 am and peaks between 2–3 pm, with a drop-off after 6&amp;nbsp;pm. The frequency of storms with lightning (as opposed to rainstorms) on Gerlach's summit and on the other highest ridges is little different from lower elevations,&lt;ref&gt;Kazimierz Chomicz and Ferdinand Šamaj, "Zrážkové pomery." In: Mikuláš Konček, et al. ''Klíma Tatier.'' 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; too, but people exposed to wind, (sometimes freezing) rain, and lightning have greater difficulty to cope. The nearest shelter for those who ascend Gerlach is the Sliezsky Dom Hotel, there are no natural shelters along the route.

'''ISO 3166-2:LK''' is the entry for [[Sri Lanka]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Sri Lanka, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for two levels of subdivisions:
* [[provinces of Sri Lanka|9 provinces]]
* [[districts of Sri Lanka|25 districts]]

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|LK}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of the Sri Lanka. The second part is either of the following:
* one digit (1&amp;ndash;9): provinces
* two digits: districts

For the districts, the first digit is the second part of the ISO 3166-2 code of the province where the district is in.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

[[ISO 639-1]] codes are used to represent subdivision names in the following [[official language|administrative language]]s:
* (si): [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]]
* (ta): [[Tamil language|Tamil]]
* (en): [[English language|English]]

[[File:Independence Square with fountain and Basseterre Co-Cathedral of Immaculate Conception.JPG|thumb|Independence Square]]

'''Independence Square''' is a square in [[Basseterre]], [[Saint George Basseterre Parish]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]]. It was named on the occasion of [[St. Kitts and Nevis]] achieving political independence on September 19, 1983. Originally called '''Pall Mall Square''', The Government first acquired it in 1750 and it rapidly became the administrative, commercial and social centre of [[Basseterre]]. The Square was the site of the [[slavery|slave market]]. Slaves arriving from [[Africa]] were temporarily quartered in the basement of a building on the south side of the Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Historical Sites in St. Kitts {{!}} Independence Square {{!}} stkittstourism.kn|url = http://www.stkittstourism.kn/explore-st-kitts-activities-attractions-historical-sites-display.php?business=151|website = www.stkittstourism.kn|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Terry Coppock''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] [[British Academy#Fellowship|FBA]] [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] (2 June 1921 – 28 June 2000) was a British geographer who was the [[Ogilvie Professor of Human Geography]] at [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1966 to 1986 and Secretary and Treasurer of the [[Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland]] from 1986 to 2000. He was a pioneer in three areas of scholarship – [[agricultural geography]], [[Land management|land-use management]] and [[computer applications]].&lt;ref&gt;http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.5871/bacad/9780197262788.003.0010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and war years==
Coppock was born in [[Crieff]] in [[Perthshire]] the son of Arthur Coppock and Valerie Margaret Phillips.&lt;ref name="royalsoced.org.uk"&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/...index/fells_indexp1.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family moved to [[Wales]] and he was educated at [[Stanwell School|Penarth County School]]. He left school at 17 in 1938 and became a civil servant in the Lord Chancellor's Department. Shortly afterwards he joined a territorial battalion of the [[Welsh Regiment]], went to camp in August 1939, and did not return to civil life for over seven years. He spent the first two and a half years of military service in various parts of the UK including [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], and the next four and a half in various parts of the [[Middle East]] which he reached via [[Cape Town]] and [[Aden]]. He returned to the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]] in 1946 and rapidly became in turn an executive officer in the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] and an officer of Customs and Excise (his pre-War ambition). A year later, in 1949, he left to accept a place at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], where within two years he was awarded first class in both Parts I and II of the [[Department of Geography, University of Cambridge|Geographical]] [[Tripos]].&lt;ref name="RoSoEd"&gt;[http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/coppock_john.pdf Obituary] by the Royal Society of Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and later life==
After a year as a research student in Cambridge, reading widely and continuing his practice of sampling senior undergraduate courses in other disciplines, he was  appointed to the staff of the Geography Department of [[University College London]], where he remained for fifteen years, as Assistant Lecturer (1950–52), Lecturer (1952–64) and Reader (1964–65). In 1963-64 he also spent a year as visiting senior lecturer in the Department of Geography in the [[University of Ibadan]] in [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name="RoSoEd" /&gt;

Coppock was appointed as the first [[Ogilvie Professor of Human Geography|Ogilvie Professor of Geography]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1965. This professorship is named after [[Alan G. Ogilvie]], a figure who was key to setting up the department. Coppock taught a range of courses in [[economic geography]], [[rural planning]], [[agricultural geography]] and the regional geography of [[Scotland]].  He also initiated the [[Master of Science|MSc]] Course in [[Geographical Information Systems]], the first of its kind in the world. During which time he worked closely with the government advising them on issues of agriculture, tourism, census data and Scottish affairs - introducing a variety of [[cartography]] and [[geographic information systems]]. Through the [[International Geographical Union]], he also advised the [[Canada|Canadian]] government.

Retirement from the Ogilvie Chair in 1986 was followed immediately by his appointment as Secretary and Treasurer of the [[Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland]], serving until his death in 2000. He also became Chairman of the [[Field Studies Council|Scottish Field Studies Council]] and played a major role in raising half a million pounds for a major development at the field centre at [[Kindrogan House]] in [[Perthshire]] which was appropriately named the Coppock Building in May 1995 when opened by HRH [[The Princess Royal]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst8032.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Edinburgh]] on 28 June 2000.

==Family==

Coppock married Sheila Mary Burnett in 1953. She died in 1990.&lt;ref name="royalsoced.org.uk"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3134">'''Kilometre per square kilometre''' is an [[SI derived unit]] of [[reciprocal length]] used for measurement of density of a [[length|linear]] feature in an [[area]]. It is used to measure, for example, [[drainage density]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eoearth.org/article/Stream_morphometry&lt;/ref&gt; or [[road density]] (i.e. kilometres of road per square kilometre of land).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balochistan.gov.pk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=113&amp;Itemid=164&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport density in the European Union==

In the European Union, Kilometer per square kilometer is the unit of measure of transport network density.

===Motorway density===
According to Europa.eu, {{quote|Despite having only a small motorway network (91 km), the island of Malta reported the highest motorway network density among all regions of the EU.}}
Usually, the densest motorway networks are found around capital cities and other big cities, in large industrial conurbations and around major seaports.

The regions with the higher motorway density are:
* the  German city-state regions of Bremen, Hamburg and Berlin (186&amp;nbsp;km, 107&amp;nbsp;km and 86&amp;nbsp;km per thousand km²)
* Düsseldorf  (121&amp;nbsp;km  per  thousand km²) 
* Saarland (93&amp;nbsp;km per thousand km²).&lt;ref name="KS-HA-13-001-10-EN"&gt;https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3217494/5784025/KS-HA-13-001-10-EN.PDF/28921853-f4a0-4f2f-80d3-f7d1a9b4021c&lt;/ref&gt;
* the north-western part of England (138&amp;nbsp;km per thousand km² in Greater Manchester)
* the West Midlands of England (90&amp;nbsp;km per thousand km²);
* the Randstad region in the west of the Netherlands (where densities reached 129&amp;nbsp;km, 128&amp;nbsp;km and 106&amp;nbsp;km per thousand km² in Zuid-Holland, Utrecht and Noord-Holland  
respectively)
* the southern Dutch regions of Limburg and Noord-Brabant (100&amp;nbsp;km and 99&amp;nbsp;km per thousand km² respectively).

For cities, most cities are rounded by a motorway ring, so the density metric is dependent on the size of the city:
* Lisboa (222&amp;nbsp;km per thousand  km², in 2004),
* Wien (109&amp;nbsp;km per thousand km²)
* Comunidad de Madrid (98&amp;nbsp;km per thousand  km²)&lt;ref name="KS-HA-13-001-10-EN" /&gt;

===Rail density===

EU-15 had 48.3&amp;nbsp;km of railways per 1 000 square kilometres in 2000), more than in the United States (30.6&amp;nbsp;km/1 000 km2 in 1999, including Alaska and Hawaii and inland waters) but less than in Japan (53.5&amp;nbsp;km/ 1000km2 in 1999).&lt;ref&gt;http://edz.bib.uni-mannheim.de/www-edz/pdf/eurostat/04/KS-DA-04-001-EN-N-EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

For rail networkds, in Europe, the highest network density can be found in the Czech Republic, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany (above 100&amp;nbsp;km/1 000&amp;nbsp;km²), followed by the Netherlands, Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, the United Kingdom and Poland (65 to 86&amp;nbsp;km/1 000&amp;nbsp;km²). At the lower end of the range are Turkey, Norway, Finland and Greece, with values of 20&amp;nbsp;km/1 000&amp;nbsp;km² and below.&lt;ref&gt;https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Archive:Transport_infrastructure_at_regional_level&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Lesley graduated from the [[University of Sydney]] in 1972 with a Bachelor of Science in [[geology]]. She graduated with 1st class honours. In 1973 she completed a Diploma of Education in science and mathematics at the [[University of Canberra]]. In 1978 she went on to complete a Doctor of Philosophy in geology and [[geochemistry]]) at the [[Australian National University]].

== Research and contributions ==
Wyborn has over 42 years in geoscience research and geoinformatics. She began her research career in geochemistry, focusing primarily on the geochemistry of [[granite]]s, [[ore deposit]]s and regional alteration systems. She begin using computers in her research in 1994. She determined the essential parts of different Australian mineral systems, and computationally modeled these parts to understand why or deposits form in certain places.&lt;ref name="ANU"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/wyborn-lai|title=Lesley Wyborn|last=Lesley|first=Wyborn|date=|website=Lesley Wyborn - ANU|publisher=Australian National University|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyborn has played a major role in allowing geoscientists to use computers in research. She made contributions to the development of the [[GeoSciML|Geoscience Markup Language]] (GeoSciML), which allows  access to freely available geoscience data. She also led the development of the Open Geospatial Consortium&lt;ref name="GSA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geosociety.org/awards/15speeches/geoinfo.htm|title=Geological Society of America - 2015 Geoinformatics Award - Lesley Wyborn|website=www.geosociety.org|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the co-developer of the Australian Virtual Geophysics laboratory, which she worked on from 2012 to 2013.&lt;ref name="GSA"/&gt;

Lesley's current research involves developing the  NCI National Environmental Research Data Interoperability Platform (NERDIP) and the NeCTAR Virtual Geophysics Laboratory (VGL).&lt;ref name="ANU"/&gt;

'''''[[Steptoe and Son]]''''' is a [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[British sitcom|sitcom]] created by comedy writers [[Galton and Simpson|Ray Galton and Alan Simpson]], originally broadcast over four series between 1962 and 1965, and again for a further three series and two Christmas specials between 1970 and 1974. Two films followed the series; ''[[Steptoe and Son (film)|Steptoe and Son]]'' and ''[[Steptoe and Son Ride Again]]''.

The series revolved around father-and-son duo [[#Albert Steptoe|Albert]] and [[#Harold Steptoe|Harold Steptoe]], the titular father and son, who live together in their [[Rag-and-bone man|rag-and-bone]] yard with their horse Hercules. The comedy was born from their differing views on their situation; Albert was quite content in the house, whilst Harold was desperate to better himself and get away; these plans though, were often thwarted by Albert, who didn't want his son to leave home.

==Main characters==
===Albert Steptoe===
'''Albert Edward [[Siege of Ladysmith|Ladysmith]] Steptoe''' ([[Wilfrid Brambell]]), was born on 26 September 1899,&lt;ref&gt;''A Perfect Christmas''&lt;/ref&gt; though he always claimed to have been born in 1901. He is illegitimate, his father being unknown but is believed to have been a local muffin man who died in 1910; the portrait Albert keeps of his father is in fact of [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]]. However, information delivered in some episodes suggests Albert's father was also a rag and bone man. For example, it is revealed that the "...and Son" in the business name referred to Albert, when his father had "Steptoe and Son" painted on the yard gate. Albert appears to have joined the army underage at the beginning of the [[First World War]], and is seen wearing the [[Mons Star]] medals to prove it. On one occasion, he tells a reporter that he joined the [[Grenadier Guards]], somewhat unlikely given his small stature. Among his claims, he says he was hit by a grenade in 1917 which did not explode. He threw it back to the German trenches with devastating effect, especially on the canteen, sending sausages and sauerkraut flying into the air. He apparently served with the [[North Russia Campaign|British Expeditionary Force]] to [[Archangel (Russian city)|Archangel]], [[White Movement|White Russia]], in 1919. He is lazy, stubborn, narrow-minded, foul-mouthed, and has revolting personal habits. Albert is content with his place in the world, utterly unpretentious and downright cynical. He can be extremely vindictive and does everything he can to prevent Harold, his son, from improving himself — especially if it means him leaving home. He is normally unshaven and wears a very old pair of [[false teeth]], discoloured and with teeth missing. His wife – alternately named Gladys and then Emily – died on 23 December 1936. He mentions in one episode that he was one of 14 children. It is revealed in "Steptoe a la Cart" that he has a daughter in France, and "Oh, What a Beautiful Mourning!" suggests his "niece" could also be his daughter; in "Cuckoo in the Nest" that he has a son in Australia.

===Harold Steptoe===
'''Harold Albert [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]] Steptoe''' ([[Harry H. Corbett]]) was born in 1925 (Corbett's birth date) in the 1960s series, or around 1930 in the 1970s series. In the episode "Loathe Story" he says he was aged 10 just before the outbreak of the Second World War, which would indicate a birth year in 1928 or 1929, and in the episode "A Star is Born" he claims to be the same age as [[Sean Connery]], (born 25 August 1930). Harold was educated at Scrubs Lane Elementary School, and it was revealed in "The Bird" that his father withdrew him from school when he was just 12 years old. He too is obstinate, though prone to moments of enthusiasm about an idea. Harold unlike Albert, has aspirations. He wants to move up in the world — most of all to escape from the family home and his stifling relationship with his father. This is the subject of the first episode, "The Offer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uktv.co.uk/gold/item/aid/528069 |title=The tragedy of Harold's inability to escape the clutches of his father |accessdate=25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He likes to see his business as [[antique]]s rather than junk. He bitterly regrets leaving the army; his army service took him to [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya]] and he achieved the rank of corporal. He nearly always wears a workman's belt adorned with army [[cap badge]]s. In the 1960s series, however, he had served in the final years of the Second World War, though he had tried to avoid being called up into the [[Royal Artillery]] on false medical grounds. He is a dreamer and idealist. Politically, Harold is a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] supporter who is appalled that his father is a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] supporter. He aims to improve his mind and his social circle but always fails, often due to Albert's deliberate put-downs or sabotage. Harold's exasperation and disgust at his father's behaviour often results in his repeating the [[catchphrase]] "You dirty old man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uktv.co.uk/gold/item/aid/528069 |title=Famous catchphrase, "You dirty old man" |accessdate=25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extended Steptoe family===
* '''Zita Steptoe''' ([[Carolyn Seymour]]) is briefly the wife of Harold, in only [[Steptoe and Son (film)|the first film version]]. She and Harold meet at the local [[rugby football|rugby]] club, where she is performing as a [[stripper]]. After a brief whirlwind romance, she and Harold get married and fly to [[Spain]] for their [[honeymoon]], but it is gatecrashed by Albert. After a bout of [[food poisoning]], Albert and Harold fly home, leaving Zita in Spain. Feeling bored and unloved, she leaves Harold for one of the British holiday representatives at the hotel. Some months later, she and Harold reunite, revealing that she is pregnant and she tells him that the child is his. Having broken off her relationship with the holiday rep, Zita moves back in with Harold and Albert, but Albert goes out of his way to make Zita feel uncomfortable and she flees. A short while later a baby, believed to be Harold and Zita's is found on the Steptoe's doorstep, parodying  [[Nativity of Jesus|the Nativity]]. Believing it to be Zita's, Harold and Albert have it baptised and name it after the priest who conducts the [[Naming ceremony|christening]] - who is also called Albert. The baby disappears while under Albert's care. Harold goes searching, and finds Zita stripping again at the rugby club, and saves her when she is pushed into a scrum of rugby players. He fails, and is saved by Zita's band musician. The two carry him back to her dressing room where he hears a baby crying behind a curtain. He moves the curtain back to reveal a mixed-raced baby - the son of Zita and her band musician, who is black and now a couple. Harold realises he was not the father of the first baby. Zita and her storyline is not referenced in [[Steptoe and Son|the television series]] or [[Steptoe and Son Ride Again|the sequel]].
* '''Emily Steptoe''' ([[née]] '''Bonclark'''), known also as '''Gladys Steptoe''', is the mother of Harold and the late wife of Albert. Emily died on the 23 December 1936, when Harold was only young. Her death meant that while growing up, Harold idolised his mother, almost to a fault. When Albert thought of remarrying, Harold would rant about what a saint Emily had been, and how no other woman would ever fill her boots. Albert, however, would shatter his illusions
* '''Auntie Rose Bonclark''' was Emily Steptoe's sister. While growing up, Rose was looked up to by Harold, but only in minority compared to his mother. In the Series 8 episode ''Porn Yesterday'', Harold acquired a [[What the Butler Saw (mutoscope)|What the Butler Saw]] machine, in which was a film of a milkman and a housewife in a bath, which Harold realised was Albert, and Albert told him that the woman was his mother's sister, to Harold's dismay. Albert then said that Rose died on [[pneumonia]] a fortnight after the film was produced, most likely due to all the milk being poured over her in the film; she and Albert were even listed in the credits. On more than one occasion, when looking for a photograph of his mother, Harold gets his mother and Auntie Rose mixed up.
* '''Uncle Arthur Steptoe''' ([[George A. Cooper]]) is one of Albert's fourteen brothers and sisters, appearing in the episodes ''And Afterwards At...'' and ''Oh, What a Beautiful Mourning!''. In his first appearance, he is in attendance of Harold's ill-fated wedding, arriving with the rest of the Steptoe clan feigning sympathy, but really trying to take back the [[food mixer]] he gave Harold for his wedding. He reappears at the funeral of his and Albert's brother, George, having arranged his funeral and the funerals of the other Steptoe siblings, Bob and Freda, mainly to his own profit but he denies it. He has a wife, Deborah, and a son, Jeffrey. He works at a [[bus garage|bus depot]].
* '''Auntie May''' ([[Rose Hill (actress)|Rose Hill]]) and '''Uncle Herbert''' ([[James Bulloch (actor)|James Bulloch]]) are Albert's sister and her husband, a bus [[inspector]]. The two appear in the Series Four episode ''And Afterwards At...'',  coming round to comfort Harold after his aborted wedding to Melanie and to reclaim their gift. They are much better off that the rest of their siblings, and offer Harold the chance to come and stay with them. Auntie Ethel holds it against Auntie May that she moved away from their home, [[Cairo]] Road, and left her alone with their mother. Auntie May is much less emotionally upset and sympathetic than the other aunts, proclaiming that she was right when she said it wouldn't last between the two.
* '''Auntie Ethel''' (Joan Newell) and '''Uncle Ted''' (George Hirste) are Albert's sister and brother-in-law, appearing in ''And Afterwards At..'', as guests at Harold's aborted wedding to Melanie. Auntie Ethel is greatly upset by Melanie's abandonment of her nephew, but visits mainly to reclaim her wedding gift for her daughter, Elsie, who has recently become engaged. Ethel invites Harold to stay with her and Ted, saying that Albert "puts the mockers on anybody". Ethel has a small grudge against her sister, May, who left her alone at the family homestead in [[Cairo]] Road with their mother. Joan Newell previously appeared in the episode ''The Stepmother'' (1962), playing Albert's fiancée, Emma Marshall.
* '''Auntie Daphne''' ([[Gretchen Franklin]]) appears in ''And Afterwards At..'', reclaiming her wedding gift to Harold, a set of bed linen.
* '''Auntie Minnie''' ([[Mollie Sugden]]) appeared in ''Oh, What a Beautiful Morning!'' as a sister of Albert. She was a quiet, aloof woman, who confided in Albert that the only thing worth having, as was the consensus with the rest of the family, was a white [[figurine]] on George's mantelpiece. She was first to storm out when she found out what George had done to his money, and was never mentioned again. Mollie Sugden previously appeared in ''And Afterwards At...'', not as a relative of the Steptoe family, but as the mother of Harold's fiancée, Melanie. It is hinted at, by Auntie Ada, that she used to let her house out to soldiers from [[Canada]] in [[World War Two]] and that she has looser morals than the rest of the family.
* '''Uncle Nobby''' ([[Tommy Godfrey]]) is a brother of Albert's, appearing in ''Oh, What a Beautiful Mourning!''. He is the only relative Albert won't hear insulted, believing Nobby is an [[intellectual]], whilst Harold sarcastically describes him as the family's answer to [[Malcolm Muggeridge]]. He is married to Alice, but Alice had many affairs, resulting in five children that Nobby believed was his - Albert said that her daughter, Caroline, could well be his. The shock of finding out that none of the five were actually his children, Nobby found solace in [[whiskey]], and remained in a permanent state of semi-inebriation. Albert says he was one of [[Billy Graham]]'s first coverts at [[The Albert Hall]].
* '''Auntie Ada''' ([[Rita Webb]]) is a sister of Albert's, appearing in ''Oh, What a Beautiful Morning!''. She is an older, rounder woman with a loud mouth. Her brother, Arthur, tells her to stop swearing at the funeral. Harold is depressed by the fact that he will be lumbered with her, because he thinks she is going insane and dresses like [[Carmen Miranda]] despite her advanced age. Albert describes her harmless, but Harold persists in the belief that she is "potty"; Albert put it down to her husband deserting her for a woman in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] upon his return from the [[Dunkirk evacuation]]. Webb previously appeared in ''And Afterwards At...'', as '''Auntie Freda Bonclark''', a sister of the late Emily Steptoe and Auntie Rose.
* '''Jeffrey Steptoe''' (Simon Cord) is the nasal-sounding son of Arthur, nephew of Albert and cousin of Harold. He appears in ''Oh, What a Beautiful Mourning!''. He runs a stall selling various assorted items on a stall on the [[Portobello Road]], after previously running a window-cleaning business. He was a godson of his uncle, George Steptoe.
* '''Caroline Steptoe''' ([[Yvonne Antrobus]]) is a distant cousin of Harold, and the niece (and potential daughter) of Albert. She appears in ''Oh, What a Beautiful Mourning!''. Caroline's mother, Alice, used to bring Caroline to stay with Albert and Harold at their home when she was young, but by the time of the funeral they had not seen each other for many years. Both instantly attracted to each other, they agree that it is alright for them to get together, because they are far-removed cousins. After the funeral, Harold agrees to go with her to a party that one of her friends is holding.
* '''Joyce''' ([[Queenie Watts]]) is a relative of the Steptoe family, appearing in ''Oh, What a Beautiful Mourning!''. She gets into an argument with her relative, Jessie, over a vase before the funeral of George Steptoe. She, along with the rest of the family, leave the house in a fit of rage when they are told they haven't been left anything.
* '''Jessie''' (Margaret Flint) is a relative of the Steptoe family, appearing in ''Oh, What a Beautiful Mourning!''. She gets into an argument with Joyce over a vase, who tells her she is only family through marriage. She looks after Uncle Nobby at the funeral. Flint previously appeared briefly as a distant Steptoe relative in ''And Afterwards At...'', possibly the same character.
* '''Ted''' ([[Bartlett Mullins]]) is a relative of the Steptoe family, appearing in ''Oh, What a Beautiful Mourning!''. He nearly takes a hat belonging to Albert, thinking it was one of George's.
* '''Alice''' ([[Gilly Flower]]) is the wife of Nobby and mother of five children, whose paternity is uncertain. She appears in the episode ''Oh, What a Beautiful Mourning!''. Her daughter, Caroline, tells Harold that she is ransacking the [[linen]] cupboard, and insists she will not visit George's graveside when she finds out she won't get anything. She used to work at a [[dog racing]] track.
* '''Elsie''' ([[Stella Moray]]) is a niece of Albert's, who appeared in ''Oh, What a Beautiful Mourning!'', in charge of distributing the drinks around the family before the funeral. She flirts briefly with Harold.
* '''George [[Nightingale]] Steptoe''' is the eldest brother of Albert and his siblings, who died in events before the episode ''Oh, What a Beautiful Mourning!'', in which his funeral is held. He died at the age of 93, with a considerable amount of money. He was [[Godparent|godfather]] to his nephews Harold and Jeffrey, and two other unnamed relatives, all four of whom were [[pallbearers]] at his funeral. He asked Albert and his wife for a loan of £25 in 1927, to help him with an immigration to [[Australia]], but this never followed through. When he died, knowing how ugly his family could get, he arranged for all his furniture to be taken away and sold during his funeral, leaving his relatives nothing but a glass of [[champagne]] each; he sold his belongings, for the sum of £1527, and had the money split equally between the [[RSPCA]] and [[Battersea Dogs Home]]. His funeral was managed by his brother, Arthur. Despite strict opposition and cursing from his surviving family, Harold was amused, and made a toast to him as "the only Steptoe I ever knew with a sense of humour". His family hurriedly left his house, insulted and offended, saying they wouldn't visit his grave. The only thing worth any value in his house, which was being eyed up by all his relatives, was a white [[figurine]] on his [[mantelpiece]], which Albert cunningly stole and hid under his massive [[bowler hat]] before he left for the funeral.
* '''Auntie Celia''' sent Harold a [[telegram]] for his wedding to Melanie in ''And Afterwards At...''.
* '''Bob Steptoe''' and '''Freda Steptoe''' are the already-deceased siblings of Albert, whose funerals were organised by their brother Arthur, who got a [[tiepin]] from Bob's funeral. For Freda's, Arthur took a pound from all the family and pocketed the money, giving her some dead flowers from his garden instead.

==Other characters==
* '''Reverend Charles Cakebread''' ([[Anthony Sharp]]) is the Steptoe family's local vicar, who comes to visit the Steptoe's at various inopportune moments, occasionally accompanied by his wife ([[Dorothy Frere]]). On his last visit, he finds the [[What the Butler Saw (mutoscope)|What the Butler Saw]] machine containing the film made by Albert and his sister-in-law, Rose. He takes the machine and uses it at his church [[fayre]], using some old films - also starring Albert - that his [[Boy Scouts]] found in a demolished shed.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps'' characters}}
The following is a list of characters for the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps]]'' written by [[Susan Nickson]] and broadcast by the [[BBC]]. The first series began on 26 February 2001 with the final ninth series being broadcast in May 2011.

==Main characters==

===Gaz Wilkinson===
*'''Played by:''' [[Will Mellor]]
Gary "Gaz" Wilkinson: Born in 1980, Gaz has two sisters (Julie and Tasha) and a half-brother, [[#Munch|Munch]]. He works as a mechanic at Brindley Autos, originally owned by his father until it was sold to Donna. Gaz is a stereotypical "blokey bloke" who likes football (supporting [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]), and also beer, sex, ''[[Hollyoaks]]''&lt;ref&gt;An inside joke, [[Will Mellor]] was one of the original main cast members of [[Hollyoaks]], playing [[Jambo Bolton]].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Monarch of the Glen (TV series)|Monarch of the Glen]]''. He is an avid collector and user of pornography and has a phobia of sheep. In a late series 5 episode, Gaz and Donna plan to move to a house in [[Knowsley, Merseyside|Knowsley]], but on a visit to check out the house he spots a sheep in the field and is too terrified to want to live there anymore. In the episode when Donna moves into Gaz's flat, she notices that he has some strange habits, such as only using bread from the middle of the loaf when making toast. His favourite books include ''The Lust of the Mohicans'', ''Pleasure Island'', ''Macbiff'' and ''The Count Of Monte Cristo'' (although the cover doesn't actually say "Count"). He is the person responsible for splitting up Jonny and Kate, much to the happiness of Janet. At one point, he cheats on Donna by sleeping with Janet. This secret is kept quiet for a while, until he accidentally reveals his betrayal to Donna one night in bed. After this, he and Donna split up for a while, until they get back together after he is involved in a road accident. Gaz finds out he has a low sperm count after deciding to become a sperm donor because he feels broody; this supposedly proves that Jonny is Corinthian Keogh's father. He proposes to Donna numerous times throughout Series 6 before the two of them finally get engaged, and they eventually marry in Series 7. After the marriage ceremony, Louise finds out that Gaz is Corinthian's real father and, despite trying to keep it secret, informs him, to his delight; but she decides not to tell Janet, who is still dealing with the loss of Jonny. Gaz and Janet finally realise they belong together, and at the end of series 7, Donna leaves them to be together. In series 8, Donna returns and Gaz is happy with Janet, but cannot resist having sex with Donna for old times' sake; eventually, Janet and Donna give him an ultimatum to choose between them. Gaz decides that he loves Donna after all, and drives to her, crashing a car on the way. He wakes up in hospital, to find Donna at his bedside. This result was chosen by viewers in an online poll. In series 9, Gaz is in a [[wheelchair]] following the car accident, after a year-long [[coma]]. Throughout the next series Gaz struggles to comes to terms with being disabled and tells Donna that he will walk again; with a little help from her he manages to take his first steps. In the final episode, Gaz turns 30 and realising he has never been outside [[Runcorn]] he decides to travel the world with Donna. She, however, finding out she may have cancer, tells Gaz she won't be coming with him, but doesn't tell him the reason. Gaz then says an emotional farewell to her at the airport before leaving to start his new life. Janet is currently unaware that Gaz is the father of her son, due to Jonny taking a paternity test before he died, but Gaz has previously tried to tell Janet this, however; realizing it may upset her, Gaz decides to keep the paternity of Corinthian from Janet.

===Donna Henshaw===
*'''Played by:''' [[Natalie Casey]]
Donna Louise Henshaw was conceived in a [[Ford Capri]] and born in 1981; after a long relationship she marries [[#Gaz Wilkinson|Gaz Wilkinson]]. She has a GCSE in Music, and is the brazen, sexually precocious one of the group. She dislikes vegetarian students and dietiers (however, she very much disliked Gaz when he was fat). She is also known to have a vicious temper, and once killed an ex-boyfriend's budgie{{Clarify|date=July 2012}}. Donna  has a younger sister, Katie, and an estranged younger brother, Dion, who is also the father of Louise's baby; there's also apparently another younger, unnamed brother who is only seen in the episode "Spunk". Their mother Flo, to whom Donna was very close, dies after being run over by a truck. She is estranged from her father, for unknown reasons. Donna is employed for a time by O'Connor's Plastics selling buckets, rising to a well-paid executive until she is sacked for stealing and crashing a company van{{When|date=July 2012}}. Donna and Gaz briefly split after Donna finds out about Gaz's one night stand with her best friend [[#Janet Keogh|Janet]]; she then goes to great lengths to hide the fact she still has feelings for him including considering plastic surgery. They eventually get back together after Gaz is involved in a road accident, when she finally admits that she loves him. She proposes to Gaz at the end of Series 6, after rejecting his earlier proposal to her, and they finally marry in Series 7. Donna works at the Archer after taking over the manager's position from [[#Tim Claypole|Tim Claypole]], but seeking to move onwards, obtains a job in London, leaves Gaz and reveals she has met a man called 'Wesley', with whom she returns in Series 8. At the end of the series, however, Gaz chooses to be with Donna over Janet. The ninth series sees Donna struggling to adapt to her new life without Janet and Louise and looking after Gaz. In the series finale after Gaz realises after celebrating his 30th birthday that he has never left [[Runcorn]] he decides to travel the world with Donna but after finding out she may have cancer she tells Gaz she won't be coming with him but doesn't reveal the reason why. Gaz then gives Donna an emotional farewell at the airport before leaving to start his new life.

===Janet Keogh===
*'''Played by:''' [[Sheridan Smith]] (Series 1–8)
Born 25 June 1981 as Janet Smith, Janet Keogh has GCSEs in P.E. and Home Economics and is the homely girl who loves “things that go bleep bleep”, [[Cheeky Vimto]], [[cigarette]]s, [[Coronation Street]] and [[Rich tea|rich tea biscuits]]. Janet initially works in Sayers' (Hampson's) Bakery until she beats Donna for the position of manager of The Archer, shortly before it is closed down by health and safety inspectors. Janet and Jonny are together from Series 1 and she has always tried to remain loyal to him. However, she kisses ex-boyfriend Andy outside the Archer during Series 2, only to be caught by Gaz and Louise. When engaged to Jonny Janet realises that she doesn't love him any more and dumps him. This leads to jealousy when Jonny finds a new girlfriend, Kate. During this time, Janet has a one-night stand with Gaz after both are feeling unloved, but are discovered by Louise; Louise later reveals this during a flashback. Janet manages to persuade Jonny to come back to her, and they marry in Series 5. She later gives birth to a child, "Corinthian McVitie Keogh".&lt;ref&gt;Jonny thought of the name, showing his obsession with biscuits, though his favourites - Jammie Dodgers - are made by Burtons.&lt;/ref&gt; In Series 7, Jonny's death affects Janet greatly and her sense of loss results in her attempting to seduce Gaz's half-brother Munch; she also allows Louise to move in with her. Eventually she realises that she loves Gaz, and Donna's departure for London leaves them together. However, at the end of the eighth series, Gaz chooses to be with Donna over Janet. By series 9, after Gaz wakes up from his year long coma, Janet has taken Corinthian and moved away to Milton Keynes. Janet is still unbeknownst that Jonny took a paternity test before he died, which revealed Gaz to be the father of their son, following their fling a few years back.

===Jonny Keogh===
*'''Played by:''' [[Ralf Little]] (Series 1–6)
Born 30 June 1981, Jonny is a devoted husband to [[#Janet Keogh (née Smith)|Janet Smith]].{{efn|In the Series Four episode “[[List of Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps episodes#Series Four .282008.29|Filthy Brunching]]” his birth date is shown as 26 October on the file deleted by Louise.}}

Jonny loves daytime television (especially ''[[Through the Keyhole]]'', [[GMTV|''LK Today'']], [[This Morning (TV series)|''This Morning'']] and [[As Time Goes By (UK TV series)|''As Time Goes By'']]), eating cat food, [[desiccated coconut]], carpets (because they are “nice”), egg butties, [[Bovril]] and his six o’clock sandwich. He has a fetish for biscuits - mostly [[Jammie Dodgers]]. Jonny’s obsession for biscuits is shown in many episodes.

Jonny is a keen fan of [[Liverpool F.C.]], has a secret obsession with the film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and also enjoys cartoons such as ''[[ThunderCats]]''&lt;ref&gt;the theme tune of which was his "favourite lullaby"&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' from his childhood. Despite being a husband and a father, Jonny frequently struggles to deal with his feminine side (according to Janet his “big cock-munching side”); Jonny nearly punches Janet in the Series 6 episode “[[List of Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps episodes#Series Six .282008.29|Drunk]]” when she calls him “a big gay” after she began to push him around because she was sick of it.

[[Sheridan Smith]] has said that Susan Nickson intended Jonny to become more gay as time passed, but [[Ralf Little]] was not keen on this; however he went along with it{{How|date=July 2012}}. Nickson herself claims that she was only exposing Ralf's “latent homosexuality”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

He is killed off-screen in the first episode of series 7, “[[List of Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps episodes#Series Seven .282008.29|When Jonny met Sharky]]”. Following his death, Janet has a statue made of his body, and still keeps the head in her home, after it is broken off. It is revealed by Louise that Jonny took a paternity test before he died, following recent events between Janet and Gaz, as Janet became pregnant after having a one-night stand with Gaz, which Jonny found out about when Janet was in labour. The test revealed Gaz to be the father of Janet's son and not Jonny. This is unbeknownst to Janet, as she still believes that Jonny is her son's father.

===Louise Brookes===
*'''Played by:''' [[Kathryn Drysdale]] (Series 1–8)
Louise Susannah Brookes, born in 1982, is initially seen as a student of [[sociology]], although she is in one episode seen as a trainee [[social worker]]. She is desperate to find the perfect man and loves horoscopes, [[Coronation Street]], collecting [[Sylvanian Families]], balloon animals, [[Steps (group)|Steps]] and the [[Disney Store]]. She dislikes old people and fears getting old. She is childish, selfish, naive, insensitive and deters most men she meets. Louise has a high-pitched voice which Kelly the barmaid says “chills her to the bones,” and Donna has called her a “squeaky little twatbag”. Louise discovers that she is adopted later on; her adoptive mother is a [[Bipolar disorder|"depressed maniac"]] who sits in her nightie looking at the fridge all day. Louise eventually meets her birth mother and her husband (initially, mistakenly believing him to be her real father) before tracking down her birth father, Brian, who turns out to be a gay alcoholic conman. She also mentions an "Auntie Nigel" on more than one occasion, who is supposedly a psychopath. Louise is a snob who neither respects nor even wants to look at Jonny. On one occasion (Series 1, Episode 5) Jonny snogs her then tells her she “tastes like [[lard]]”, although at one point she stated that she liked him "in a way". Louise even got "dull" Jonny shot once: When she took a job at the [[Office for National Statistics]], she changed his profile on the computer to that of a serious armed criminal (and "Thailand's tallest prostitute") to make it less boring. This resulted in Jonny being shot in the knee in the grounds of [[Halton Castle]], for which Louise was arrested and charged with "incitement to [[Grievous bodily harm|GBH]]". She had a brief stint as the manager of the Sayers' bakery in which Janet worked, but was eventually fired after sacking all of her employees. Near the end of the sixth series, it is revealed that Louise is pregnant and that Donna's younger brother, Dion, is the father. In series seven she resides with Janet and Corinthian and has found out that she is carrying a baby girl; this disappoints her as she fears the baby girl may be "prettier" than she is. In the last episode of series 7 she gives birth, somewhat assisted by Munch, and although she initially agrees to call the baby "Louise Munch Brooks" she then decides that the name Munch disgusts her and names the baby "Louise Louise Brooks". In series 8 Louise is seen at first struggling to bond and care for her baby until Tim &amp; Janet reassure her she will be a great Mum and that she will always have their support. In episode 7 Louise meets her new popstar boyfriend, Scott Chegg. By series 9, she's left Runcorn and 'joined that weird [[lunar deity|moon-worshipping]] [[cult]]'. She was originally going to be back for series nine as her character was supposed to come back to Runcorn with her boyfriend but Drysdale was busy filming in Spain for the fourth series of the hit comedy [[Benidorm]].

===Tim Claypole===
*'''Played by:''' [[Luke Gell]] (Series 7–9)
Tim Claypole (who shares his name with the mischievous and delightfully campy jester [[Timothy Claypole]] from the 1980s kids' TV show ''[[Rentaghost]]'') is the new bar manager of The Archer at the start of Series 7. He turns it into a [[theme pub]], and the only evidence of the [[John Barrowman]] theme is a single framed photograph. He temporarily employs Janet as a barmaid before hiring Donna, who soon takes over his position as manager. Although appearing to be [[homosexual|gay]], he maintains that he is happily married to a rugby-playing wife named Helena and has children. In series 8 Tim is more involved with the group in helping solve their problems such as advising Donna to stay away from Gaz. By series 9, Tim has given the Archer a makeover and has made peace with his best friends Gaz and Donna, but then his younger sister Cassie arrives into his life and causes chaos. With the arrival of Cassie and all the subsequent changes in his life, Tim reveals that Helena has left him and he is gay. He later meets a new love interest, Leonard.

===Wesley Presley===
*'''Played by:''' [[Thomas Nelstrop]] (Series 8)
Wesley is Donna's [[London]] boyfriend whom she met off-screen during series 7; a businessman turned market trader, he moves to Runcorn in series 8 to be with Donna, demanding that she divorce Gaz. But after advice from Gaz as to how to integrate into [[Runcorn]], he takes it all too seriously and is [[taser]]ed by Janet. He gives Janet a job in his market stall, selling [[Val Doonican]] CDs and other things. He appears for the last time in the musical special, where he says that he "came here [to Runcorn] with Donna, but he stays for the pasties." He is a [[father]], though Donna is not aware of this.

===Billy McCormack===
*'''Played by:''' [[Freddie Hogan]] (Series 9)
[[Metrosexual]] [[scouser]] (resident of [[Merseyside]]) Billy longs to be a professional footballer - but in the meantime, he's a carer, and a rather enthusiastic one at that. Always saying "Alright babe," Billy is open about his feelings and starts off as a carer for the newly wheelchair-using Gaz. Billy wants Gaz to like him but says things such as "suck my cock" which doesn't impress Gaz. Billy manages to proves himself to be a hero and friend to Gaz and Donna when their flat is burned down and he saves them. Gaz tries to repay Billy by getting him a chance to be a footballer, but Billy just gets drunk instead. Billy later falls for Cassie and they start a relationship which almost ends in the final episode when she has to choose between him and her ex.

===Cassie Claypole===
*'''Played by:''' [[Georgia Henshaw]] (Series 9)
A trouble-maker, Cassie's just been released from a young offenders' Institution. She's Tim's sister, and although he'd rather like it if she left The Archer, her old school crush, Billy, is a regular, so she's not going anywhere. Cassie is sarcastic and often cruel to her brother and everyone around her, yet if the love of her life Billy pays her a shred of a compliment, she turns into a screaming girl. She attempts dozens of times to impress Billy, dressing up as [[Lady Gaga]] and doing what Gaz says because he can supposedly get Billy to "shag" her. In episode 4, Cassie goes on a date with Billy turns unsuccessful. When she realises Billy likes to be bossed about, they begin a relationship. In the final episode Cassie's ex-boyfriend turns up at The Archer with Cassie having to choose who to be with and she ends up choosing Billy.

===Munch Wilkinson===
* '''Played by:''' [[Lee Oakes]] (Series 3–5, 7)
"Munch" (whose real name is never revealed in the programme) appears one day at the garage where Gaz works, and turns out to be his long-lost half-brother. Gaz finds that he's "a bit of a yoghurt" and is not allowed to hang around people too much. Munch would love to have a girlfriend but has to make do with the 'girl with sick on her' every Friday night. He develops a fixation for Donna after stumbling across her waiting for Gaz while wearing her kinky nurse's outfit. His attempts to attract women are usually unsuccessful due to his social ineptness- he once asked a "desperate" woman in The Archer if she'd like to "see his [[penis|knob]]". He did, however, have a very brief relationship with Kelly the barmaid. Munch likes [[Vimto]] (according to him it is "big, clever and purple, like the [[prime minister]]" and "a really mellow high" - believing it to be alcoholic), salt and vinegar chipsticks, [[Steak sauce|brown sauce]] and stale bread sandwiches. He often calls Gaz "Mr. Wilkinson", and it appears his sole talent is to make defunct car engines work. Munch disappears after the series 5 episode "Fat", but returns in series 7, appearing to have found God while in Birmingham. An irate Gaz forces him to drink a glass of Vimto, and he reverts to the Munch of old. In the last episode of series 7, he helps Louise give birth to a baby girl in the Archer, Louise Louise Brooks. This is his last appearance in the programme.

===Flo Henshaw===
*'''Played by:''' [[Beverley Callard]] (Series 1–3)
Flo Henshaw (13 January 1959 – 1 January 2005) is Donna's mother, and nicknames herself "the thinking man's strumpet". She has also modelled for [[Pornographic magazine|top shelf]] magazines such as ''Readers Wives'' and ''Pregnant Mums.'' Early in the series, she shows interest in Gaz, who finds this worrying, and on one occasion is caught by Jonny in [[In flagrante delicto|suspicious circumstances]] with Janet's father Pete Smith. However, Flo offers Donna some useful advice when things are not going well with Gaz. She does not appear in series 4 (Callard had by this time returned to her role in ''[[Coronation Street]]''), and by the start of series 5 she has been killed off in a traffic accident. Donna finds out that all the "uncles" she had were actually Flo's lovers. Flo is still mentioned throughout the series after her death and in series 5 Donna has moved back to her mum's home after briefly splitting with Gaz before selling it at the end of the series.

===Kelly Crabtree===
*'''Played by:''' [[Hayley Bishop]] (Series 4–6)
Kelly is first seen working at the local Sayers' Bakery, where she is a sycophantic lackey to Louise, lacking self-confidence. Later in the series, she is the regular barmaid at The Archer and has become voraciously promiscuous, even with the pub's elderly regulars, particularly Arthur. Kelly even has a brief relationship with Munch, but leaves him jammed into a playground [[Swing (seat)|swing]]. When she is denied the job of manager, she remains in the Archer, working for Janet, and is last seen smothered by [[Potato chip|crisp]] wrappers in the final episode of series 6.

===Leonard===
*'''Played by:''' [[Samuel Barnett (actor)|Samuel Barnett]] (Series 9)
Leonard is introduced in series 9 when Tim begins to look for a relationship after [[coming out]] as gay. He is from [[Frodsham]] and is openly gay. He shows interest in Tim and decides to ask him out on a date, to which Tim agrees.

===Kate===
*'''Played by:''' [[Alison Mac]] (Series 4)
Kate is a temporary barmaid at The Archer and becomes Jonny's girlfriend after he splits up with Janet. Having a lot in common with Jonny, especially a love of biscuits, she and Jonny are almost constantly having sex. None of the others are fond of her, and after Gaz tries to seduce her to break them up, Kate resolves to take Jonny away from them and they leave Janet's house together. However, Jonny quickly dumps her when Kate asks him to leave his beer behind. Kate is possessive towards Jonny and has a patronising attitude toward his friends .

===David Fish===
*'''Played by:''' [[Jonathon Dutton]] (Series 3–4)
In series 3 Louise gets a [[Valentine's Day|valentine]] card from a secret admirer who turns out to be a geeky guy from her schooldays who has turned into a rather good-looking guy. He has a pseudo-Australian accent since he has been living in [[Melbourne]] for the last eight years and is now a student in the area. David performs well on their first night together but not at all the next night, due to exhaustion and (according to him) the "friction burns on [his] cock". He had also had a one-night stand with Donna a year prior, which upsets Louise and is the source of her grudge against Donna for a while. David is something of a "[[new-age]]" man, being interested in [[self-help]] books and [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]]. He is eventually dumped by Louise. He then speaks to Donna, observed by Gaz and Jonny, and convinces her to become a student in series 4.

===Corinthian Keogh===
*'''Played by:''' Lewis Vilamor (Series 5),&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|2548966|Lewis Vilamor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamie and Zoe Ryde-Weller (Series 6),&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|2548519|Jamie Ryde-Weller}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|2545989|Zoe Ryde-Weller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thea and Sophia Perry, Alfie and Harvie Walters (Series 7), Charlee and Neo Hall, Gabriel and Ethan Claasen (Series 8)

Corinthian McVitie Keogh is the son of [[#Gaz Wilkinson|Gaz Wilkinson]] and [[#Janet Keogh|Janet Keogh]]. Born in series 5, nine months after Janet slept with [[#Gary "Gaz" Wilkinson|Gaz]]. The baby's middle name reflects Jonny Keogh's love of biscuits, [[McVitie's]] being a biscuit brand. Although Jonny raises him as his own until his death, Corinthian's paternity is initially uncertain. Gaz attempts to claim him in series 6, but doubts he is the father after he finds out about his low sperm count. However, in series 7 a DNA test finally reveals Gaz to be the father. Gaz decides not to inform Janet of this, as she sees Corinthian as a reminder of Jonny. In Series 8, the episode "Gazman" finds Gaz applying to family court for parental responsibility for Corinthian, but Corinthian moves away with Janet before the beginning of the ninth series.

==Minor characters==
*'''Katie Henshaw''' ([[Vicky Connett]]) - Katie, introduced in series 1, is Donna's younger teenage sister, who tried seducing Gaz.
*'''Pete Smith''' ([[Rob Jarvis]]) - Pete is Janet's father; protective of her, he does not approve of Jonny. Pete is introduced in series 3 when, offscreen, he refuses Jonny's request to marry Janet, and is first seen in the episode "Hospikal" when he is inveigled into agreeing to pay for the wedding after all when Jonny discovers that Pete is having an affair with Flo. A down-to earth [[scouser]] from [[Toxteth]], he works as a builder and plays darts for his local pub team. In Series 4, in the episode "Homeless and Horny", he throws Jonny out of the house he and Janet live in after their break up; this is his last appearance in the series.
*'''Andy''' ([[Oliver Boot]])- Janet's previous boyfriend whom she bumps into again in series 2 and they kiss. Although this doesn't lead to anything, Jonny is jealous and confronts Andy in his home in the final episode. While there, Jonny steals a ring which he later uses to propose to Janet. Louise goes out with Andy in the first episode of series 3, attracted by his wealth, but he leaves her in the restaurant to pay the bill, leaving the girls to assume that he wasn't that rich after all.
*'''Phillip''' ([[Alan Westaway]]) - Phillip is Donna's self-confident, but arrogant university [[tutor]]; he tries to persuade Donna to have sex with him in return for good marks. Gaz finds out about the arrangement and confronts Phillip while he and Donna are having [[brunch]]; this cures Gaz's impotence.
*'''Arthur''' - Arthur is the most frequent regular at The Archer, appearing in many scenes but never speaking. He has sex with Kelly on several occasions, and once kisses Jonny in an attempt to find out whether Jonny is really gay. At the beginning of series 7, he has recorded some [[soundbite]]s, not all of them appropriate, for Louise, to help her through her vocal problem. He appears through the final episode in series 9, his last moment being having his head stuck to the table by Cassie so she can watch him struggle.
*'''Dion''' (Robert Hartley)- Dion is Donna's younger brother. An unpleasant teenager, his only appearance is in the series 6 episode "Closing Time", in which Gaz agrees to look after him against Donna's wishes. However, it appears that he has had sex with Louise during her earlier "alcoholism" and is the father of her baby. Donna implies to Gaz that she has asked Dion to move in with them, but by series 7 he has moved to [[Bolton]].
*'''Brian''' ([[Colin McFarlane]]) - Brian is Louise's biological father, and when she is given a photograph of him is horrified to discover that he "...wears socks with sandals." He is tracked down by Louise, using only the angle from which the photograph has been taken—and the address written on the back. When they meet in The Archer for the first time, it becomes clear that Brian is a [[Confidence trick|con-man]]. When Jonny turns up, Brian takes a shine to him. Jonny eventually realises that he is gay and rejects Brian, who in turn reveals that he is an alcoholic.
*'''Louise Louise Brooks''' (Gracie Eve and Amelie Rose Pelta) - Louise's baby with Donna's younger brother Dion. Louise tells Munch that as he was her birthing partner, the baby would be named Louise Munch Brooks, but she's lying and instead names her Louise Louise Brooks after herself.

{{Water salinity}}
This is a '''list of bodies of water by salinity''' that is limited to natural bodies of water that have a stable salinity above 0.05%, at or below which water is considered fresh. 

Water salinity often varies by location and season, particularly with [[hypersaline lake]]s in arid areas, so the salinity figures in the table below should be interpreted as an approximate indicator.

This is a '''list of [[city|cities]] in [[Chile]]'''.

A city is defined by Chile's [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]] (INE) as an "urban entity"&lt;ref group=note&gt;An "urban entity" is defined by Chile's [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]] as a concentrated group of dwellings with over 2,000 inhabitants, or between 1,001 and 2,000 inhabitants if 50% or more of its population is economically active, dedicated to [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary]] and/or [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary]] activities. Exceptionally, populated centers dedicated to tourism and recreation with over 250 concentrated dwellings and that do not meet the population requirement are considered urban.&lt;/ref&gt; with more than 5,000 inhabitants. This list is based on a June 2005 report by the INE based on the 2002 census which registered 239 cities across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ine.cl/canales/chile_estadistico/demografia_y_vitales/demografia/pdf/cdpubaldcasjunio2005.zip Chile: Ciudades, Pueblos, Aldeas y Caseríos 2005], Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas – June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13969">This article is a '''list of countries by cremation rate'''. [[Cremation]] rates vary widely across the world with some countries like Japan, Nepal and Thailand having a rate over 95% while other countries like Italy, Ireland and Poland having less than 10%. Factors include culture and religion; for example, the cremation rate in Muslim, Eastern Orthodox, and Roman Catholic majority countries is much lower due to religious sanctions on cremation, whereas for Hindu or Buddhist majority countries the cremation rate is much higher. Cemetery fees impel towards the choice of cremation.

==Europe==

===United Kingdom===
The cremation rate in the United Kingdom has been increasing steadily with the national average rate rising from 34.70% in 1960 to 77.05% in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.urnsforashes.co.uk/cremation-statistics/|title=National Cremation Statistics 1960-2017|author=|publisher=The Cremation Society of Great Britain|date=2018-08-03|accessdate=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nordic countries===
Cremation rates in the Nordic countries vary from Norway's 36% to Finland's 51%&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.seurakuntalainen.fi/uutiset/vainajan-tuhkauksen-jalkeisesta-siunaamisesta-tarkemmat-ohjeet/ Vainajan tuhkauksen jälkeisestä siunaamisesta tarkemmat ohjeet] seurakuntalainen.fi 30.5.2017&lt;/ref&gt;, Sweden's 70% and Denmark's 76%. Cremation is most common in the older larger cities, which are running out of cemetery plots, and rarest in the countryside and small towns where burial places are readily available. In all countries the cremation rate in large towns is generally between 70% and 90%.

===Netherlands===
The first cremation in the Netherlands was performed in 1914. In the hundred years since the cremation rate has risen to 63% in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/07/31/nederland-crematieland-3473097-a1514112 |title=Nederland Crematieland |newspaper=NRC |language=Dutch |date=2016-08-01 |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
Cremation remains a minority practice in rural France where burial places are available, but is increasingly common in urban areas. In 1979 just 1% of funerals involved cremation: in 2012 it was 32%, rising to 45% in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/le-succes-de-la-cremation-en-france-31-10-2012-1523637_23.php |title=Le succès de la crémation en France |newspaper=Le Point |language=French |date=2012-10-31 |accessdate=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===
Cremation has been on the increase in Ireland in the last decade. This is largely due to both the expense of burial plots and their (lack of) availability. Today, over 6% of deaths in Ireland now involve cremations and approximately 10% of funerals in Dublin, or about 2,000 services a year are cremations. There are five crematoria in Ireland, three of which are located in Dublin (Glasnevin (the first facility of its type in Ireland, established in 1982), Newland’s Cross, Harold’s Cross), one in Cavan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lakelandscrematorium.ie|website=www.lakelandscrematorium.ie|publisher=Lakelands Funeral Home|accessdate=22 August 2016|ref=Crematorium Open Date}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one in Cork. However, access to these cremation facilities is not restricted to people living in Dublin or Cork. Anyone may arrange for a cremation to take place in any of these crematoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muldowney|first1=Jennifer|title=Say Farewell Your Way|date=June 2013|publisher=OakTree Press|location=Cork|pages=79|edition=1st|url=http://www.farewellfuneralplanners.ie|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another crematorium is due to open in Shannon in 2017.

=== Spain ===

The cremations in Spain are booming, in 2005 cremated 16% of deaths in Spain and in 2017 the figure reached 40% of the total

===Hungary===
Cremation recently more popular than burial in Hungary: in 2016 it was around 60%, with 70%-90% in Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://index.hu/gazdasag/2016/11/01/temetkezesi_piac/|title=Haldoklik a hagyományos temetkezés|last=Fruzsina|first=Előd|access-date=2017-08-11|language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==

===Canada===
The cremation rate in Canada has been increasing steadily with the national average rate rising from 5.89% in 1970 to 68.4% in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cremationinfo.com/cremationinfo/PDF/WebHistData.pdf|title=Historical Cremation Data - United States vs. Canada|author=Cremation Association of North America|publisher=Cremationinfo.com|date=2003-10-06|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfda.org/about-funeral-service-/trends-and-statistics.html|title=Trends and Statistics|author=|publisher=National Funeral Directors Association|date=2010|accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rates vary greatly among the provinces with the most recent (1999) province level statistics showing that [[British Columbia]] had the highest rate at 74% while [[Prince Edward Island]] had the lowest rate at 8.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cremationinfo.com/cremationinfo/PDF/WebCanCremFigures.pdf|title=Canadian Cremation Figures|author=Cremation Association of North America|publisher=Cremationinfo.com|date=2003-08-25|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a sortable summary of the pages [[Timeline of volcanism on Earth]], [[List of Quaternary volcanic eruptions]], and [[Large volume volcanic eruptions in the Basin and Range Province]]. Uncertainties as to dates and [[tephra]] volumes are not restated, and references are not repeated. [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI)]] values for events in the [[Miocene]] epoch sometimes lack references. They are given as VEI-equivalent, as orientation{{Clarify|date=November 2011}} of the erupted tephra volume.

'''Mi'kma'ki''' or '''Mi'gma'gi''' is the traditional and current territories of the [[Mi'kmaq]] people. It is shared by an [[Non-governmental organization|inter-Nation forum]] between Mi'kmaq [[First Nations]] and is divided into seven geographical and traditional districts, with an eighth representing [[Newfoundland (island)|Taqamkuk]] today. Mi'kma'ki is one of the confederate countries within [[Wabanaki Confederacy|Wabanaki]].

Each district was autonomous, headed by a ''[[Sachem|Sagamaw]]'', who would gather alongside [[Wampum]] readers and knowledge keepers called ''Putu's'', a women's council and the ''Kji Sagamaw'', or Grand Chief, to form the [[Grand Council (Mi'kmaq)|''Sante''' or ''Mi'kmawey Mawio'mi'']] (Grand Council).&lt;ref name="Diss"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McMillan|first1=Leslie Jane|title=Mi'kmawey Mawio'mi: Changing Roles of the Mi'kmaq Grand Council From the Early Seventeenth Century to the Present|date=December 1996|pages=219|url=http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp04/mq24981.pdf|accessdate=26 September 2017|publisher=Dalhousie University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seat of the Sante' Mawio'mi is at [[Chapel Island (Canada)|Mniku]] in [[Cape Breton Island|Unama'kik]] and still functions as the capital today in the [[Potlotek]] reserve.

Following contact, Mi'kma'ki was colonized by the French [[Acadia|Acadian]] and British [[Nova Scotia]] colonies and their competing claims for the land. Siding with the French, the Mi'kmaq fought alongside other Wabanaki troops during the [[French and Indian Wars|global wars between 1688-1763]]. The European powers divided Mi'kma'ki in the treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Paris (1763)]]. The British claimed Mi'kma'ki as their possession by conquest and the defeated Mi'kmaq signed the Peace and Friendship Treaties to end hostilities and encourage cooperation between the Wabanaki countries and the British and ensure the survival of the Mi'kmaq people whose numbers had dwindled to a few thousand from disease and starvation. The power held within Mi'kma'ki faded further after the Confederation of Canada united the colonies and Canada passed the [[Indian Act]], and the loss of autonomous governance. 

Today, the Sante' Mawio'mi functions solely as a spiritual and dialogue forum, with oversight held by the [[Government of Canada]] through Mi'kmaq First Nations instead of Mi'kma'ki and the Kji Sagamaw. The traditional lands' sovereignty has never been ceded by the Mi'kmaq,{{sfn|Paul|2000|p=160}} although legal arguments have been made that the Peace and Friendship treaties legitimized the takeover of the land by Britain.

==Governance==
[[File:Micmac camp.jpg|thumb|left|Mi'kmaq camp in [[Unama'kik]] in 1857]]

Traditionally each district had its own independent government. Those governments were composed of a chief and a council. The council included the band chiefs, elders and other important leaders. The role of the councils was similar to those of any independent government and included to edict laws, establish a justice system, divide the territory for hunting and fishing, make war and search for peace. 

The overarching [[Grand Council (Mi'kmaq)|Grand Council Sante Mawiomi]] was composed of the ''keptinaq'' (captains), the district chiefs. The Grand Council also included elders, ''putus'' (historians reading the belts) and a Council of women. The Grand Council was headed by a grand chief who was one of the district chiefs, generally the Unama'kik chief. Succession was hereditary. The seat of the Grand Council was generally on [[Cape Breton Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mi'kmaq |url=https://intercontinentalcry.org/indigenous-peoples/mikmaq/ |website=Intercontinental Cry |access-date=2 December 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Districts==
The eight districts (names are given in the Franci-Smith orthography with the Listuguj orthography in brackets) are:

It is composed of three towns: Ngerekebesang, [[Meyuns]], and [[Echang]], where most Southwest Islanders moved to after a storm struck the southwest islands. They were later resettled.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} 

Meyuns is host to the largest hospital in Palau, Belau National Hospital. Ngerkebesang Island and the Island of Koror are connected by a [[causeway]]. The causeway, currently being remodeled, was originally built during the [[History of Palau#Japanese mandate|Japanese occupation of Palau]].

{{Politics of Abkhazia}}

The position of '''President of [[Abkhazia]]''' was created in 1994. Before the office of president was created the [[head of state]] position was known as the Chairman of Parliament between 1992 and the [[Constitution of Abkhazia|creation of the 1994 constitution]]. Before the position of Chairman of Parliament, the highest office in Abkhazia was the Chairman of the [[Supreme Soviet]]. The post would last from the declaration of [[sovereignty]] from the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]] on 25 August 1990 until the outright [[declaration of independence]] on 23 July 1992.

==Oath of office==
During Alexander Ankvab's presidency, Parliament decided to scrap from the Presidential oath the phrase:

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|ab|Жәлар рылахь соуааит иҧшьоу абри ахақәкы сацәхьаҵны саныҟала}}&lt;br&gt; — ''If I deviate from this path, then let me be punished by my people''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During a meeting on 16 July 2014, following the [[Abkhazian Revolution]], Parliament decided to restore this phrase. According to Vice Speaker [[Emma Gamisonia]], the decision to remove the phrase had been taken because it was perceived as a [[curse]], following the premature death of Abkhazia's first two Presidents, [[Vladislav Ardzinba]] and [[Sergei Bagapsh]]. MP [[Daur Arshba]] claimed that the decision had been taken illegally, without the necessary quorum.&lt;ref name=apress_vosstanovlen&gt;{{cite news|title=Восстановлен текст присяги президента в первоначальной редакции|url=http://www.apsnypress.info/news/vosstanovlen-tekst-prisyagi-prezidenta-v-pervonachalnoy-redaktsii-/|accessdate=7 March 2015|agency=[[Apsnypress]]|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 August, the [[People's Assembly of Abkhazia]] additionally adopted a bill authored by [[Said Kharazia]], and first proposed by him during the meeting on 16 July, adding the invocation&lt;ref name=apress_vosstanovlen/&gt;&lt;ref name=apress12800&gt;{{cite news|title=Депутаты парламента большинством голосов внесли изменение в текст присяги президента РА.|url=http://apsnypress.info/news/12800.html|accessdate=17 September 2014|agency=[[Apsnypress]]|date=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|ab|Иа Анцәа Ду, суҳәоит Сыԥсадгьыли сыуаажәлари рымаҵ аураҿы амчи алшареи суҭарц!}}&lt;br&gt; — ''Almighty God, give me strength to serve country and people!''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The precise definition of "proto-state" in political literature fluctuates depending on the context in which it is used. For instance, it has been used by some modern scholars to describe the self-governing British colonies and dependencies that exercised a form of [[home rule]] but remained integral parts of the [[British Empire]] and subject firstly to the metropole's administration.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Hr1GDQAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Age of Secession: The International and Domestic Determinants of State Birth|last=Griffiths|first=Ryan|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=978-1107161627|location=Cambridge|pages=85–102, 213–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Republics of the Soviet Union]], which represented individual administrative units with their own respective national distinctions, have also been described as proto-states.&lt;ref name=Hahn/&gt; In more recent usage, the term ''proto-state'' has most often been evoked in reference to militant secessionist groups that claim, and exercise some form of territorial control over, a specific region but lack institutional cohesion.&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt; Such proto-states include the [[Republika Srpska]] and [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia|Herzeg-Bosnia]] during the [[Bosnian War]]&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt; and [[Azawad]] during the [[Tuareg rebellion (2012)|2012 Tuareg rebellion]].&lt;ref name="Azawad1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Azawad: Tuaregs, Jihadists, and an Uncertain Future for Mali|last=Alvarado|first=David|url=https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/142674/NOTES%2054_ALVARADO_english.pdf|location=Barcelona

==History==

The term "proto-state" has been used in contexts as far back as [[Ancient Greece]] to refer to the phenomenon that the formation of a large and cohesive nation would often be preceded by very small and loose forms of statehood.&lt;ref name="Empires"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=u8QTDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT150&amp;dq=The+Dynamics+of+Ancient+Empires+proto-state&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSt4_7xv_WAhWBEVAKHQ85AVsQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Dynamics%20of%20Ancient%20Empires%20proto-state&amp;f=false|title=The Dynamics of Ancient Empires: State Power from Assyria to Byzantium|last1=Scheidel|first1=Walter|last2=Morris|first2=Ian|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0195371581|location=Oxford|pages=5–6, 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, historical sociologist Gary Runciman noted that Greek city-states in [[classical antiquity]] such as [[Classical Athens|Athens]] were initially weak proto-states that later evolved into larger and more centralised political entities.&lt;ref name=Empires/&gt; Most ancient proto-states were the product of tribal societies, consisting of relatively short-lived confederations of communities that united under a single warlord or chieftain endowed with symbolic authority and military rank.&lt;ref name=Empires/&gt; These were not considered sovereign states since they rarely achieved any degree of institutional permanence and authority was often exercised over a mobile people rather than measurable territory.&lt;ref name=Empires/&gt; Loose confederacies of this nature were the primary means of embracing a common statehood by people in many regions, such as the Central Asian steppes, throughout ancient history.&lt;ref name=Huns1&gt;{{cite book|last=Kim|first=Hyun Jin|title=The Huns|date=2015|pages=3–6|publisher=Routledge Books|location=Abingdon|isbn=978-1138841758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proto-states proliferated in Western Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], likely as a result of a trend towards political decentralisation following the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and the adoption of [[feudalism]].&lt;ref name=Borza&gt;{{cite book|last=Borza|first=Eugene|title=In the Shadow of Olympus: The Emergence of Macedon|date=1992|pages=238–240|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0691008806}}&lt;/ref&gt; While theoretically owing allegiance to a single monarch under the feudal system, many lesser nobles administered their own [[fief]]s as miniature "states within states" that were independent of each other.&lt;ref name=Politics1&gt;{{cite book|last=Duverger|first=Maurice|title=The Study of Politics|date=1972|pages=144–145|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons, Publishers|location=Surrey|isbn=978-0690790214}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was especially notable with regards to large, decentralised political entities such as the [[Holy Roman Empire]], that incorporated many autonomous and semi-autonomous proto-states.&lt;ref name=Danube&gt;{{cite book|last=Beattie|first=Andrew|title=The Danube: A Cultural History|date=2011|page=35|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199768356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Age of Discovery]], the emergence of European [[colonialism]] resulted in the formation of colonial proto-states in Asia, Africa, and the Americas.&lt;ref name=Abernethy&gt;{{cite book|last=Abernethy|first=David|title=The Dynamics of Global Dominance: European Overseas Empires, 1415-1980|date=2002|pages=327–328|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=978-0300093148}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few colonies were given the unique status of [[protectorate]]s, which were effectively controlled by the metropole but retained limited ability to administer themselves, [[Self-governing colony|self-governing colonies]], [[dominion]]s, and [[Dependent territory|dependencies]].&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt; These were distinct administrative units that each fulfilled many of the functions of a state without actually exercising full sovereignty or independence.&lt;ref name=Abernethy/&gt; Colonies without a sub-national [[home rule]] status, on the other hand, were considered administrative extensions of the colonising power rather than true proto-states.&lt;ref name=Lusophone&gt;{{cite book|last=Morier-Genoud|first=Eric|title=Sure Road? Nationalisms in Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique|date=2012|page=2|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|location=Leiden|isbn=978-9004222618}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial proto-states later served as the basis for a number of modern nation states, particularly on the Asian and African continents.&lt;ref name=Abernethy/&gt;

During the twentieth century, some proto-states existed as not only distinct administrative units, but their own theoretically self-governing republics joined to each other in a political union such as the socialist federal systems observed in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hahn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kosovo1&gt;{{cite book|last=Kostovicova|first=Denisa|title=Kosovo: The Politics of Identity and Space|date=2005|pages=5–7|publisher=Routledge Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0415348065}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Les rebelles touaregs joignent leurs forces dans le nord du Mali (8248043080).jpg|thumb|250px|Tuareg rebels in the short-lived proto-state of [[Azawad]].]]

Another form of proto-state that has become especially common since the end of [[World War II]] is established through the unconstitutional seizure of territory by an insurgent or militant group that proceeds to assume the role of a ''de facto'' government.&lt;ref name="Jihad"/&gt; Although denied recognition and bereft of civil institutions, insurgent proto-states may engage in external trade, provide social services, and even undertake limited diplomatic activity.&lt;ref name=Sellström&gt;{{cite book|last=Sellström|first=Tor|title=Sweden and National Liberation in Southern Africa: Solidarity and assistance, 1970–1994|date=2002|pages=97–99|publisher=Nordic Africa Institute|location=Uppsala|isbn=978-91-7106-448-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These proto-states are usually formed by movements drawn from geographically concentrated ethnic or religious minorities, and are thus a common feature of inter-ethnic civil conflicts.&lt;ref name=COIN1&gt;{{cite book|last=Christian|first=Patrick James|title=A Combat Advisor's Guide to Tribal Engagement: History, Law and War as Operational Elements|date=2011|pages=36–37|publisher=Universal Publishers|location=Boca Raton|isbn=978-1599428161}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often due to the inclinations of an internal cultural identity group seeking to reject the legitimacy of a sovereign state's political order, and create its own enclave where it is free to live under its own sphere of laws, social mores, and ordering.&lt;ref name=COIN1/&gt; The accumulation of territory by an insurgent force to form a sub-national geopolitical system and eventually, a proto-state, was a calculated process in China during the [[Chinese Civil War]] that set a precedent for many similar attempts throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.&lt;ref name=Geography/&gt; Proto-states established as a result of civil conflict typically exist in a perpetual state of warfare and their wealth and populations may be limited accordingly.&lt;ref name="El País"&gt;{{Cite news

==Theoretical basis==
[[File:Oslobođena teritorija u vreme prvog zasedanja AVNOJ-a.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Territory controlled by the [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia|Anti-Fascist Council of Yugoslavia]], which established its own proto-state in 1942]]

The definition of a proto-state is not concise, and has been confused by the interchangeable use of the terms ''state'', ''country'', and ''nation'' to describe a given territory.&lt;ref name=Atlas&gt;{{cite book|last=Middleton|first=Nick|title=An Atlas of Countries That Don't Exist: A Compendium of Fifty Unrecognized and Largely Unnoticed States|date=2015|pages=14–16|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|location=London|isbn=978-1447295273}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term proto-state is preferred to "proto-nation" in an academic context, however, since some authorities also use ''nation'' to denote a social, ethnic, or cultural group capable of forming its own state.&lt;ref name=Atlas/&gt;

A proto-state does not meet the four essential criteria for statehood as elaborated upon in the [[declarative theory of statehood]] of the 1933 [[Montevideo Convention]]: a permanent population, a defined territory, a government with its own institutions, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states.&lt;ref name=Atlas/&gt; A proto-state is not necessarily synonymous with a [[List of states with limited recognition|state with limited recognition]] that otherwise has all the hallmarks of a fully functioning sovereign state, such as [[Rhodesia]] or the Republic of China, also known as [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name=Atlas/&gt; However, proto-states frequently go unrecognised since a state actor that recognises a proto-state does so in violation of another state actor's external sovereignty.&lt;ref name=Coggins&gt;{{cite book|last=Coggins|first=Bridget|title=Power Politics and State Formation in the Twentieth Century: The Dynamics of Recognition|date=2014|pages=35–64, 173|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1107047358}}&lt;/ref&gt; If full diplomatic recognition is extended to a proto-state and embassies exchanged, it is defined as a sovereign state in its own right and may no longer be classified as a proto-state.&lt;ref name=Coggins/&gt;

Throughout modern history, partially autonomous regions of larger recognised states, especially those based on a historical precedent or ethnic and cultural distinctiveness that places them apart from those who dominate the state as a whole, have been considered proto-states.&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt; Home rule generates a sub-national institutional structure that may justifiably be defined as a proto-state.&lt;ref name=Augusteijn&gt;{{cite book|last=Augusteijn|first=Joost|title=The Irish Revolution, 1913-1923|date=2002|page=13|publisher=Palgrave|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-0333982266}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a rebellion or insurrection seizes control and begins to establish some semblance of administration in regions within national territories under its effective rule, it has also metamorphosed into a proto-state.&lt;ref name=Nigeria&gt;{{cite book|last=Araoye|first=Ademola|editor-last=Okome|editor-first=Mojubaolu|title=Contesting the Nigerian State: Civil Society and the Contradictions of Self-Organization|date=2013|page=35|publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-1137324528}}&lt;/ref&gt; These wartime proto-states, sometimes known as ''insurgent states'', may eventually transform the structure of a state altogether, or demarcate their own autonomous political spaces.&lt;ref name=Nigeria/&gt; While not a new phenomenon, the modern formation of a proto-states in territory held by a militant non-state entity was popularised by [[Mao Zedong]] during the Chinese Civil War, and the [[Liberation movement|national liberation movement]]s worldwide that adopted his military philosophies.&lt;ref name=Geography&gt;{{cite book|last=McColl|first=R. W.|title=Encyclopedia of World Geography, Volume 1|date=2005|pages=397–398, 466|publisher=Facts on File, Incorporated|location=New York|isbn=0-8160-5786-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of an insurgent proto-state was sometimes also an indirect consequence of a movement adopting [[Che Guevara]]'s ''[[foco]]'' theory of guerrilla warfare.&lt;ref name=Geography/&gt;

Secessionist proto-states are likeliest to form in preexisting states that lack secure boundaries, a concise and well-defined body of citizens, or a single sovereign power with a monopoly on the legitimate use of military force.&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newton|first1=Kenneth|last2=Van Deth|first2=Jan|title=Foundations of Comparative Politics|date=2016|pages=364–365|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1107582859}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be created as a result of putsches, insurrections, separatist political campaigns, foreign intervention, sectarian violence, civil war, and even the bloodless dissolution or division of the state.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;

Proto-states can be important regional players, as their existence impacts the options available to state actors, either as potential allies or as impediments to their political or economic policy articulations.&lt;ref name=Nigeria/&gt;

One of the most powerful rebel leaders in Liberia, [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]], set up his own domain in a way resembling an actual state: He reorganized his [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia|militia]] into a military-like organization (split into Army, Marines, Navy, and Executive Mansion Guard), established his ''de facto'' capital at [[Gbarnga]], and created a civilian government and justice system under his control that were supposed to enforce law and order. The area under his control was commonly called "Taylorland" or "Greater Liberia" and even became somewhat stable and peaceful until it largely disintegrated in 1994/5 as result of attacks by rival militias. In the end, however, Taylor won the civil war and was elected [[President of Liberia]], with his regime becoming the new central government.{{sfn|Dwyer|2015|pp=39, 40, 62}}{{sfn|Lidow|2016|pp=116–130}}|name=Lib|group=note}}

'''''Reading Magic: How your child can learn to read before school - and other read-aloud miracles''''' is a 2001 book by [[Mem Fox]]. In it, Fox propounds reading books aloud to children from when they are babies to after they can read by themselves.

==Reception==
In a review of ''Reading Magic'' ''[[BookList]]'' noted its "cheerful, chatty style that’s totally jargon-free" and recommended it for new parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reading Magic: Why Reading Aloud to Our Children Will Change Their Lives Forever. |url=http://www.booklistonline.com/Reading-Magic-Why-Reading-Aloud-to-Our-Children-Will-Change-Their-Lives-Forever-Mem-Fox/pid=1099252 |journal=Booklist |publisher=American Library Association |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[January Magazine]]''', in its review, wrote "Fox' book isn't some boring, didactic treatise on how to improve your child's reading skills. In fact, she's not at all fond of the phonics fanatics, and even discourages making your child read aloud to show their progress.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.januarymagazine.com/nonfiction/readinggames.html |title=Take Three Books and Call Me in the Morning |author=Pamela C. Patterson |date=May 2002 |website=januarymagazine.com |publisher=january magazine |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Library Journal|Library Journal Review]]'' calls it a "rah-rah book on the benefits of reading aloud to children" and "A marginal purchase for public libraries."&lt;ref name=gvpl/&gt;

''Reading Magic'' has also been reviewed by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''&lt;ref name=gvpl/&gt; and the ''[[School Library Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=gvpl&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.gvpl.ca/s/Record/27659/Reviews |title=Reading magic : why reading aloud to our children will change their lives forever |website=m.gvpl.ca |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Lydekker''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɪ|ˈ|d|ɛ|k|ər}}; 25 July 1849 – 16 April 1915) was an English [[natural history|naturalist]], geologist and writer of numerous books on [[natural history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Lydekker, Richard|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=1096|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Map of Sunda and Sahul.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Map showing Lydekker's line in relation to those of [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace]] and [[Max Carl Wilhelm Weber|Weber]], as well as the probable extent of land at the time of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], when the sea level was more than 110 m lower than today.]]

Richard Lydekker was born at [[Tavistock Square]] in London. His father was Gerard Wolfe Lydekker, a barrister-at-law with Dutch ancestry. The family moved to [[Lydekker Park|Harpenden Lodge]] soon after Richard's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Ibis |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=617–620| year=1915 |title=Obituary |doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1915.tb08208.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he took a first-class in the Natural Science [[tripos]] (1872).&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=LDKR867R|name=Lydekker, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 he joined the [[Geological Survey of India]] and made studies of the [[vertebrate palaeontology]] of northern India (especially [[Kashmir]]). He remained in this post until the death of his father in 1881. His main work in India was on the Siwalik palaeofauna; it was published in ''Palaeontologia Indica''. He was responsible for the cataloguing of the [[fossil]] [[mammal]]s, reptiles and birds in the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] (10 vols., 1891).&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Lydekker, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He named a variety of taxa including the [[golden-bellied mangabey]]; as a taxon authority he is named simply as "Lydekker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cercocebus chrysogaster |url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/4207/0 |website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species |publisher=IUCN |accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biogeography==

He was influential in the science of [[biogeography]]. In 1895 he delineated the biogeographical boundary through [[Indonesia]], known as '''Lydekker's Line''', that separates [[Wallacea]] on the west from [[Australia-New Guinea]] on the east.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; It follows the edge of the [[Sahul Shelf]], an area from New Guinea to Australia of shallow water with the [[Aru Islands]] on its edge. Along with [[Wallace's Line]] and Huxley's Line it indicates the definite effect of geology on the biogeography of the region, something not seen so clearly in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="GillespieClague2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gillespie |first1=Rosemary G. |last2=Clague |first2=D. A. |title=Encyclopedia of Islands |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g9ZogGs_fz8C&amp;pg=PA447 |year=2009 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-25649-1 |page=447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First cuckoo==

Lydekker attracted amused public attention with a pair of letters to ''[[The Times]]'' in 1913, when he wrote on 6 February that he had heard a [[European cuckoo|cuckoo]], contrary to [[William Yarrell|Yarrell's]] ''[[History of British Birds (1843)|History of British Birds]]'' which doubted the bird arrived before April. Six days later on 12 February 1913, he wrote again, confessing that "the note was uttered by a bricklayer's labourer". Letters about the first cuckoo became a tradition in the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=First Cuckoo: Letters to "The Times", 1900–75 | publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin | author=Gregory, Kenneth | year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

He received the [[Lyell Medal]] from the [[Geological Society of London]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Geological Society of London|day_of_week=Monday |date=24 February 1902 |page_number=6 |issue=36699| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount Rigny''', {{lang-da|Rigny Bjerg}}, ''Rignys Bjerg'') is a mountain peak in East [[Greenland]].&lt;ref name="cat"&gt;{{cite web | title = Catalogue of place names in northern East Greenland | publisher = Geological Survey of Denmark | url = http://www.geus.dk/publications/bull/nr21/nr21_p117-368.pdf3 | accessdate = 18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mapcarta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapcarta.com/19186286|title=Rigny Bjerg|work=Mapcarta|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[King Christian IX Land]], [[Sermersooq]] Municipality.

The mountain was named by [[Jules de Blosseville]], after French naval officer [[Henri de Rigny|Marie Henri Daniel Gauthier, comte de Rigny]] (1782–1835).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arktiskinstitut.dk/pdf/Oestgroenlands_stednavne_portefoelje_ver_1.pdf Løve, Jan - Østgrønlands stednavne - fra den første kortlægning: Blossevilles togt med "La Lilloise" i 1833. Arktisk Institut]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Geography==
Mount Rigny is the highest peak in a mountainous area east of the [[Sortebrae Glacier]] close to the [[Blosseville Coast]]. Reaching {{convert|2734|m|ft|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="GE"&gt;[[Google Earth]]&lt;/ref&gt; Rigny Bjerg was marked on [[Jules de Blosseville]]'s map of 1833 which also contained a drawing of the mountain's profile as seen from the sea. The mountain was then identified by the 1895-96 [[Ingolf Expedition]] led by [[Carl Frederick Wandel|C.F. Wandel]], and its approximate position determined by the 1898–1900 [[Carlsbergfund Expedition to East Greenland]] led by [[Georg Carl Amdrup|G.C. Amdrup]].&lt;ref name="mapcarta"/&gt; This mountain's elevation and position are incorrect in the [[Defense Mapping Agency]] Greenland Navigation charts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/onc/txu-pclmaps-oclc-8322829_d_16.jpg 1:1,000,000 scale Operational Navigation Chart, Sheet C-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rigny Berg there are routes popular with [[mountaineer]]s, such as "Snow Falcon",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockclimbing.com/routes/Europe/Denmark/Greenland/Rignys_Bjerg/Rignys_Bjerg/Snow_Falcon_48082.html Rockclimbing - Snow Falcon - WI3]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as neighboring peaks in the region such as RHARPeak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockclimbing.com/routes/Europe/Denmark/Greenland/Rignys_Bjerg/Rignys_Bjerg/RHARPeak_48106.html Rockclimbing - RHARPeak]&lt;/ref&gt; After a failed attempt in 1998, the first full ascent of the peak was made on 19 July 2003 by the 'Midnight Sun 03 Expedition'.&lt;ref name="cat"/&gt;

Certain studies claim that the mountain corresponds to the legendary [[Norsemen]]'s '''Blåsærk'''&lt;ref&gt;"Blue Shirt" - probably a descriptive name alluding to a dark appearance towering over the white inland ice, cf [[Hvitserk]].&lt;/ref&gt; and to the '''Mount of Gods Mercie''' named by [[Henry Hudson]] in 1607.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Tornøe |first =Johannes Kristoffer |year = 1964| title = Early American history: Norsemen before Columbus | place= London | publisher= Allen &amp; Unwin | pages= 126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3256">'''Stevan Simić''' ([[Kratovo, Macedonia|Kratovo]], 9 May 1882 — [[Skopje]], 25 June 1962) was a Serb geographer, educator and member of the [[Serbian Chetnik Organization]] in [[Old Serbia]] and a MP in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].

==Life==
Simić was born in [[Kratovo, Macedonia|Kratovo]], [[Sanjak of Üsküp]] in 1882. He finished primary school in [[Thessaloniki]] and in [[Istanbul]]. After graduating from gymnasium (high school) he worked as a teacher in the village of [[Turaljevo]], close to Kratovo. In 1902 he went to continue his education at the [[University of Belgrade]] where he graduated in 1906.

In [[Belgrade]] he met the founders of the [[Serbian Chetnik Organization|Serbian Committee]] and soon became an active member of its revolutionary board. From 1906 to 1912 he worked as a teacher in Serb schools in [[Bitola]], [[Pljevlja]], [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Skopje]] in Ottoman territories. As a polyglot, during [[World War I]] he served as a translator to the British high command on the [[Salonika Front]].

After the war he served as the headmaster of high schools in [[Veles (city)|Veles]], [[Ohrid]] and [[Prizren]].&lt;ref&gt;Narodna enciklopedija SHS 4, 1929, 133.&lt;/ref&gt; This was also his most prolific period as a scientist in which he published a number of articles in the fields of ethnology, history and archeology. After frequent disputes with corrupted politicians he was sent to retirement in 1929. After this he was voted into the Yugoslav parliament as a MP for the county of [[Kratovo Municipality|Kratovo]].

At the Nazi onslaught on Yugoslavia and the Bulgarian occupation of [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] he escaped to [[Belgrade]] where he spent the rest of the war. Unlike many of his compatriots, Simić did not succumb to pressures of the communist regime to change his surname and declare himself an ethnic Macedonian. Barely tolerated by the authorities Simić lived in [[Skopje]] modestly, spending most of his time in writing [[memoirs]].&lt;ref&gt;Б. Вучетић, ''Српска револуционарна организација у Османском царству на почетку XX века'', Историјски часопис, књ. LIII (2006), 363&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Skopje]] in 1962. He donated his belongings and manuscripts to the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences. This corpus of over 200 manuscripts has a first rate significance for studying life and times of Simić's Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Komitsko četovanje u Staroj Srbiji i Makedoniji 1903-12, Belgrade 2012, foreword by J. Bajić, 9-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Encyclopaedia Sinica''''' is a 1917 [[English language|English-language]] [[encyclopedia]] on [[China]] and China-related subjects [[editing|edit]]ed by [[English people|English]] [[missionary]] [[Samuel Couling]]. It covers a range of topics and provides insight on early 20th century perspectives towards China. Commentators{{who|date=February 2012}} report that the work is still useful at the turn of the 21st century particularly to aid the understanding of the relationship between [[Anglo-Chinese relations|China and the United Kingdom]].

'''Tiszaligeti Strandfürdő''' &lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt; is situated in '''Szolnok'''.&lt;ref&gt;2&lt;/ref&gt; This city is known as the town of the spas.  There are several spas and [[swimming pool]]s in the area, which are visited from all over Europe.  In the 1900s spa containing iodine, alkali and hydrogen-carbonate was found in the area.  It is used for curing [[rheumatism|rheumatic]] and [[digestive disease|digestive organic diseases]].  It is a good entertaining facility for those who are healthy, too.  There are many pools and slip ways for people who like swimming, but there is an [[Water reservoir|artificial lake]] where we{{Who|date=June 2010}} can boat.  For little children the swimming pool offers playgrounds as well. The swimming pool can be used all the year, including winter months.

'''Volcanology of Canada''' includes [[lava]] flows, [[volcanic plateau|lava plateaus]], [[lava dome]]s, [[cinder cone]]s, [[stratovolcano]]es, [[shield volcano]]es, [[submarine volcano]]es, [[caldera]]s, [[diatreme]]s, and [[maar]]s, along with examples of more less common volcanic forms such as [[tuya]]s and [[subglacial mound]]s. It has a very complex volcanological history spanning from the [[Precambrian]] eon at least 3.11&amp;nbsp;billion years ago when this part of the North American continent began to form.&lt;ref name="API"&gt;{{cite web|title=Large Igneous Provinces in Canada Through Time and Their Metallogogenic Potential Appendix 2 |work=Mineral Deposits of Canada |publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]] |date=2008-09-24 |url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/mindep/synth_prov/lip/tables/appendix2_e.php |accessdate=2009-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604175843/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/mindep/synth_prov/lip/tables/appendix2_e.php |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the country's volcanic activity dates back to the Precambrian eon, [[volcanism]] continues to occur in [[Western Canada|Western]] and [[Northern Canada]] where it forms part of an encircling chain of volcanoes and frequent [[earthquake]]s around the [[Pacific Ocean]] called the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]].&lt;ref name="HEPO"/&gt; But because volcanoes in Western and Northern Canada are in remote rugged areas and the level of volcanic activity is less frequent than with other volcanoes around the Pacific Ocean, Canada is commonly thought to occupy a gap in the Pacific Ring of Fire between the volcanoes of [[western United States]] to the south and the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutian volcanoes]] of [[Alaska]] to the north.&lt;ref name="SLV"/&gt; However, the mountainous landscape of Western and Northern Canada includes more than 100&amp;nbsp;volcanoes that have been active during the past two million years and whose eruptions have claimed many lives.&lt;ref name="SLV"/&gt; Volcanic activity has been responsible for many of Canada's geological and geographical features and [[mineralization (geology)|mineralization]], including the nucleus of [[North America]] called the [[Canadian Shield]].

Volcanism has led to the formation of hundreds of volcanic areas and extensive lava formations across Canada, indicating volcanism played a major role in shaping its surface. The country's different volcano and lava types originate from different [[tectonics|tectonic]] settings and [[types of volcanic eruptions]], ranging from passive [[effusive eruption|lava eruptions]] to violent [[explosive eruption]]s. Canada has a rich record of very large volumes of magmatic rock called [[large igneous province]]s. They are represented by deep-level plumbing systems consisting of giant [[dike swarm]]s, [[sill (geology)|sill]] provinces and layered [[intrusion]]s.&lt;ref name="GHE"/&gt; The most capable large igneous provinces in Canada are [[Archean]] (3,800–2,500 million years ago) age [[greenstone belt]]s containing a rare volcanic rock called [[komatiite]].&lt;ref name="GHE"/&gt;

Like other Hawaiian eruptions, the relative volume of ejected pyroclastic material is less than that of all other eruption types. The main phenomenons during Hawaiian eruptions is steady [[lava fountain]]ing and the production of thin lava flows that eventually build up into large, broad [[shield volcano]]es. Eruptions are also common in central vents near the summit of shield volcanoes, and along [[fissure vent|linear volcanic vents]] radiating outward from the summit area. Lava advances downslope away from their source vents in lava channels and [[lava tube]]s.

[[File:Eve Cone.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eve Cone]], one of the best preserved cinder cones in Canada.]]
In Canada, [[cinder cone]]s form when lava fountains release fragments of lava that harden in the air and fall around a linear volcanic vent. The rock fragments, often known as [[cinder]] or [[scoria]], are [[glass]]y and contain gas bubbles "frozen" into place as magma exploded into the air and then cooled quickly. Some of the lava is not fragmented and flows from the vent as a lava flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of volcanoes |work=Volcanoes of Canada |publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]] |date=2009-02-17 |url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/type_e.php |accessdate=2009-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202064852/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/type_e.php |archivedate=February 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cinder cones are also called pyroclastic cones and are found in [[volcanic field]]s, on the flanks of shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes and calderas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gvp|vnum=1200-16-&amp;volpage=synsub|title=Silverthrone|accessdate=2009-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gvp|vnum=1200-20-&amp;volpage=synsub|title=Garibaldi|accessdate=2009-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gvp|vnum=1200-07-&amp;volpage=synsub|title=Spectrum Range|accessdate=2009-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gvp|vnum=1200-03-&amp;volpage=synsub|title=Atlin Volcanic Field|accessdate=2009-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, geologists have identified at least 30 young cinder cones on the [[Mount Edziza volcanic complex]], a large shield volcano in northwestern British Columbia with an area of {{convert|1000|km2}}.&lt;ref name="SLV"/&gt; [[Eve Cone]], on the northern end of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, is one of the best preserved cinder cones in Canada, due to its undeformed and symmetrical shape.&lt;ref name="ACO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stikine volcanic belt: Mount Edziza|work=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes|publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]]|date=2008-02-13|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/feature_edziza_e.php|accessdate=2008-12-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610154204/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/feature_edziza_e.php|archivedate=2008-06-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During other Hawaiian eruptions, fluid basaltic lava may pond in vents, [[volcanic crater|craters]], or broad depressions to produce [[lava lake]]s. As lava lakes solidify, they create a grey-silver crust that is usually only a few centimeters thick. Active lava lakes comprise young crust that is repeatedly destroyed and regenerated. Convective motion of the underlying lava causes the crust to break into slabs and sink. This then exposes new lava at the surface that cools into a new crustal layer which will again fracture into slabs and be recycled into the circulating lava beneath the crust.

Widespread basalt volcanism occurred between 60.9 and 61.3 million years ago in the northern [[Labrador Sea]], [[Davis Strait]] and in southern [[Baffin Bay]] on the eastern coast of Nunavut during the [[Paleocene]] period when North America and Greenland were being separated from tectonic movements.

[[File:Kostal Volcano.jpg|thumb|right|Kostal Cone in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field]]
[[Kostal Cone]] in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field of east-central British Columbia is a cinder cone responsible for basaltic lava flows comprising a lava bed, damming the southern end of [[McDougall Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ralphbudgell.tripod.com/files/murtle_brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There has been activity at this site as recently as 7,600&amp;nbsp;years ago at [[Dragon Cone]], though more likely less than 1,000&amp;nbsp;years ago. Kostal Cone is too young for the [[potassium-argon dating]] technique (usable on specimens over 100,000&amp;nbsp;years old), and no charred organic material for [[radiocarbon dating]] has been found. However, the uneroded structure of the cone with the existence of trees on its flanks and summit have made it an area for [[dendrochronology]] studies, which reveals the growth of tree-ring patterns.&lt;ref name="ZOI"&gt;{{cite gvp|vnum=1200-15-&amp;volpage=erupt|title=Wells Gray-Clearwater|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tree-ring dating has revealed an age of about 400&amp;nbsp;years for Kostal Cone, indicating it formed around 1500.&lt;ref name="ZOI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JPT"&gt;{{cite gvp|vnum=1200-15-|title=Wells Gray-Clearwater|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes Kostal Cone the youngest volcano in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and thus one of the youngest in Canada.&lt;ref name="JPT"/&gt;

In Canada, even though volcanoes pose significant threats to local communities and any sizable eruption would affect Canada's economy, the work of understanding the frequency and eruption characteristics at volcanoes in Canada is a slow process.&lt;ref name="HEPO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Volcanoes |publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] |date=2007-09-05 |url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/environment/naturalhazards/volcanoes/1 |accessdate=2009-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217001048/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/environment/naturalhazards/volcanoes/1 |archivedate=2009-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because most of Canada's dormant and potentially active volcanoes are located in isolated jagged regions, very few scientists study Canadian volcanoes and the provision of money in the Canadian government is limited.&lt;ref name="HEPO"/&gt; Because of these issues, scientists studying Canada's volcanoes have a basic understanding of Canada's volcanic heritage and how it might impact people in the future.&lt;ref name="HEPO"/&gt; Volcanologists are aware that certain areas in Canada have higher levels of volcanic activity than others and how eruptions in these areas might affect people and the environment they live in.&lt;ref name="HEPO"/&gt; When a volcano is showing evidence of volcanic activity, quick action will be required to better understand the process.&lt;ref name="HEPO"/&gt; The lowest possibility for an eruption in Canada per year is approximately 1/200; for a passive lava eruption the possibility is about 1/220, and for a major explosive eruption it is about 1/3333.&lt;ref name="AKB"/&gt; Even though volcanoes do not seem to be part of the everyday reality of Canadians, recurrent earthquakes and the formation of large [[mountain range]]s in the [[Pacific Northwest]] indicate this part of Canada is still geologically active. The possibility of an eruption, even a large explosive one, cannot be ruled out. Quiet as they currently seem, volcanoes in Northern and Western Canada are part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]].&lt;ref name="HEPO"/&gt; Along with volcanoes associated with recent earthquake activity, a scenario of an eruption at Mount Cayley in southwestern British Columbia illustrates how Western Canada is in danger to a volcanic eruption, which has not erupted for at least 310,000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="AKB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Geological Survey of Canada |url=http://dsp-psd.communication.gc.ca/Collection/M44-2001-A11E.pdf |format=PDF |title=Preliminary petrography and chemistry of the Mount Cayley volcanic field, British Columbia |accessdate=2009-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219153514/http://dsp-psd.communication.gc.ca/Collection/M44-2001-A11E.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This impact is becoming even more likely as population in the Pacific Northwest increases and development spreads. The scenario is based on former eruptions in the north-south trending Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and includes both explosive and passive eruptions.&lt;ref name="AKB"/&gt; Its effect is mostly due to the attention of defenseless public services in canyons.&lt;ref name="AKB"/&gt; However, the threat from volcanoes outside of Canada seems much greater than the threat from volcanoes within Canada because of the lack of monitoring data at Canadian volcanoes and the age of most volcanoes in Canada is poorly known.&lt;ref name="ZIV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Volcanic eruptions|work=Volcanoes of Canada|publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]]|date=2009-02-18|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/erupt_e.php|accessdate=2009-02-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220052524/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/erupt_e.php|archivedate=2010-02-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But for some, their minimal degree of erosion indicates they formed much less than 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, including the [[Milbanke Sound Group]] on [[Price Island (British Columbia)|Price Island]], [[Dufferin Island]], [[Swindle Island]], [[Lake Island]], and [[Lady Douglas Island]] in the [[Milbanke Sound]] area of coastal British Columbia.&lt;ref name="ZIV"/&gt; However, it is known volcanoes in the U.S. states of Alaska, [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]] and [[California]] have been more active in historic times than those within Canada.&lt;ref name="ZPQ"/&gt; Therefore, volcanoes in the United States are monitored with caution and attention by the [[United States Geological Survey]].&lt;ref name="ZPQ"/&gt;

[[File:RockSlide 1200W.jpg|thumb|left|The Barrier in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt poses a [[geohazard]] in southwestern British Columbia.]]
Growing awareness of volcanism, especially the threat from volcanoes in the United States, has led to a number of changes in the way Canadians are dealing with volcanic hazards. For example, [[The Barrier]], an unstable [[volcanic dam|lava dam]] retaining the [[Garibaldi Lake]] system of southwestern British Columbia, has in the past unleashed several [[debris flow]]s, most recently in 1855–1856.&lt;ref name="AZO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Garibaldi volcanic belt: Garibaldi Lake volcanic field |work=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes |publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]] |date=2008-02-13 |url=http://cgc.rncan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/feature_garibaldi_e.php |accessdate=2009-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311031101/http://cgc.rncan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/feature_garibaldi_e.php |archivedate=2007-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the evacuation of the small resort village of [[Garibaldi, British Columbia|Garibaldi]] nearby and the relocation of residents to new recreational subdivisions away from the hazard zone.&lt;ref name="AZO"/&gt; Should The Barrier completely collapse, Garibaldi Lake would be entirely released and downstream damage in the [[Cheakamus River|Cheakamus]] and [[Squamish River|Squamish]] rivers would be considerable, including major damage to the town of [[Squamish, British Columbia|Squamish]] and possibly an impact-wave on the waters of [[Howe Sound]] that would reach [[Vancouver Island]]. The [[Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan]], Canada's volcanic emergency notification program, was established to outline the notification procedure of some of the main agencies that would be involved in response to a volcanic eruption in Canada, an eruption close to Canada's borders, or an eruption significant enough to have an effect on Canada and its people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan: Western Canada |publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] |date=2008-05-01 |url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/pdf/ivenp_e.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604174944/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/pdf/ivenp_e.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses primarily on aviation safety because jet aircraft can quickly enter areas of volcanic ash.&lt;ref name="HEPO"/&gt; The program notifies all impacted agencies that have to deal with volcanic events.&lt;ref name="HEPO"/&gt; Aircraft are rerouted away from hazardous ash and people on the ground are notified of potential ash fall.&lt;ref name="HEPO"/&gt;

===Monitoring===
Currently no volcanoes in Canada are monitored closely enough by the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] to ascertain how active their [[magma chamber]]s are.&lt;ref name="ZPQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Monitoring volcanoes |work=Volcanoes of Canada |publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]] |date=2008-02-12 |url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/mon_e.php |accessdate=2009-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507152523/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/mon_e.php |archivedate=2008-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An existing network of [[seismometer|seismographs]] has been established to monitor tectonic earthquakes and is too far away to provide a good indication of what is happening beneath them.&lt;ref name="ZPQ"/&gt; It may sense an increase in activity if a volcano becomes very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption.&lt;ref name="ZPQ"/&gt; It might detect activity only once a volcano has started erupting.&lt;ref name="ZPQ"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2580">'''World Meteorological Organization squares''' or '''WMO squares''' is a system of [[geocode]]s that divides a chart of the world with latitude-longitude gridlines (e.g. [[plate carrée projection]], [[Mercator Projection|Mercator]] or other) into grid cells of 10° [[latitude]] by 10° [[longitude]], each with a unique, 4-digit numeric identifier (refer chart at NODC [http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOD05/data05geo.html World Ocean Database 2005] page). On the plate carrée projection the grid cells appear square, however if the Mercator projection is used, the grid cells appear 'stretched' vertically nearer the tops and bottoms of the map. On the actual surface of the [[Globe]], the cells are approximately "square" only adjacent to the equator, and become progressively narrower and tapered (also with curved northern and southern boundaries) as they approach the poles, and cells adjoining the poles are unique in possessing three faces rather than four.

Each 10°x10° square is allocated a number between 1000 and 7817. The numbering system is based first on "global quadrant" numbers where 1=NE, 3=SE, 5=SW, 7=NW which gives the initial digit of any square code (1xxx, 3xxx, 5xxx, 7xxx). The second digit (x0xx through x8xx) indicates the number of tens of degrees latitude (north in global quadrants 1 and 7, south in global quadrants 3 and 5) of the 'minimum' square boundary (nearest to the [[Equator]]), i.e. a cell extending between 10°N and 20°N (or 10°S and 20°S) has this digit = 1, a cell extending between 20°N and 30°N has this digit = 2, etc. The third and fourth digits (xx00 through xx17) similarly indicate the number of tens of degrees of longitude of the 'minimum' square boundary, nearest to the [[Prime Meridian]]. By way of illustration, the square 1000 thus extends from 0°N to 10°N, 0°E to 10°E, and the square 7817 from 80°N to 90°N, 170°W to 180°W, adjacent to the major portion of the [[International Date Line]]. In this manner, reverse-engineering (decoding) the relevant square boundaries from any particular WMO Square identifier is straightforward, in contrast to some other similar systems e.g. [[Marsden square]]s.

WMO squares are also used as the basis for the [[c-squares]] spatial indexing system, which further divides 10°x10° WMO squares into smaller units of 5°x5°, 1°x1°, 0.5°x0.5°, 0.1°x0.1°, and so on.
