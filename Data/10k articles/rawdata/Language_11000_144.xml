The '''Afrikaans Wikipedia''' ({{lang-af|{{#property:P1448}}}}) is an [[Afrikaans]] edition of the [[World Wide Web|Web]]-based [[free-content]] [[encyclopedia]] [[Wikipedia]]. The project was started on 16 November 2001, and was the 11th Wikipedia to be created.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:2001&amp;oldid=94753987 Wikipedia:2001]", English-language Wikipedia (16 December 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016 it was the 84th largest Wikipedia by number of articles. Apart from [[South Africa]] and [[Namibia]], the Afrikaans Wikipedia is used and maintained by users in [[Europe]], [[North America]] and [[Oceania]]. As of May 2013, it was the second-largest [[Languages of Africa|African language]] Wikipedia, after [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenman.co.za/blog/?p=1108 May 2013 African language Wikipedia update]. greenman.co.za. 10 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visits and edits ==
The Afrikaans Wikipedia makes up 0.008% of all Wikipedia searches. In the period of time between 1 July 2009 and 30 September 2013, the Afrikaans Wikipedia was visited the most by

{{flag|South Africa}} ('''64.0%''')&lt;br&gt;
{{flag|USA}} ('''5.5%''')&lt;br&gt;
{{flag|Germany}} ('''4.1%''')&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Flag of World.svg|23px|Wêreldvlag]] [[World]]  ('''26.4%''')

The Afrikaans Wikipedia makes up 2.2% of all searches in South Africa, after the 92.7% of the English Wikipedia. In Namibia, the Afrikaans Wikipedia is used 1.2% of the time, after the English (85.3%), German (5.7%) and Portuguese (1.5%) Wikipedias.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportPageViewsPerCountryBreakdown.htm Wikimedia Traffic Analysis Report – Wikipedia Page Views Per Country – Breakdown]. Stats.wikimedia.org. Retrieved on 23 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

0.1% of all German, 0.3% of all Belgian and 24.4% of all South African edits take place on the Afrikaans Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportPageEditsPerCountryBreakdownHuge.htm#South Africa]. Stats.wikimedia.org. Retrieved on 23 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Netherlands and Belgium's involvement in the Afrikaans Wikipedia is most likely due to the [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|language relationship]] between Afrikaans and Dutch.

'''Alakh Niranjan''' is a term used by [[Nath]] Yogis as a synonym for [[Creator deity|Creator]], and to describe the characteristics of God and the Self, known as the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]. ''Alakh'' means "one which cannot be seen (perceived)" and ''niranjan'' means "spotfree".  Niranjan is another name of Lord [[Shiva]]. Also spelled, "Alekh".

The original Sanskrit term ''Alakhshya'' means "one that can not be perceived"&lt;ref&gt;http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.5:1:413.apte&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alakh Niranjan in Yoga tradition==
Alakh means '''A-Lakhshana''' which means beyond identifying features (lakhshana) or attributes. It refers to Attributeless God or [[Nirguna]] [[Brahman]] in here. This idea comes from ancient Yoga traditions originating in Swetashwetara Upanishad. This particular [[Upanishad]] deals with Yoga, [[Vedantic]] [[Monotheism]] as well as [[Shiva]] as [[Sat-Chit-Ananda]].
-
Legend has it, that the slogan or elating cry for the Supreme Being was first coined by [[Matsyendranath]]''. Matsyendra is popularly regarded as the 'second [[Guru]]' of Nath Yoga Cult after Lord Shiva as [[Adinath Shiva|Adinath]]. He first used the words "Alakh Niranjan" to denote God as perceived by a Yoga adept in known history. His disciple is known as ''Yogi Gorakhnath'', also known as ''[[Gorakshanath]]'', without whose mention, Nath Yoga becomes unimaginable. It is Gorakhnath and Matsyendranath who popularised Kaya Sadhana throughout known limits of India and beyond. 

Gorakhnath actually organised and assimilated most Yogis of the [[Hatha Yoga]] and [[Tantra]] Cult into the enormous Nath tradition. The city of [[Gorakhpur]] in North India is named after the legendary Yogi. 'Alakh Niranjan' became a very popular name for God all over India during and after Gorakhnath's time. Later first [[Sikh Guru]], [[Nanak]] used this holy name to denote God.
* Famous works by Guru Matsyendranath: ''Kaulayogini Tantra''.
* Guru Gorakhnath's celebrated works are ''[[Gorakhsha Samhita]]'', ''Yoga-Bija''.
* Guru Nanak's works include Japji Sahib.

ADESH ADESH - 
Whenever Yogis or Nath-Yogis meet, they greet each other with the salutation “Adesh-Adesh!” Gorakshanath the Maha Yogi wrote:

:''Aatmetu paramaatmeti jiivatmeti vicaarane''
:''Trayaanaam aikya-samshutir asdes’s iti kiirtitah''

::''In our relative thought we distinguish between Atman, Paramatman, and Jiva.''
::''The Truth is that these three are one and a realization of it is called [[Adesha]].''


Thus the yogi in his contact with others expressed only the simple truth in the words, “Adesh-Adesh!” It is a foundation stone on which all spiritual light and attainment must be erected. It is the first truth to attain the First Lord

==Film adaptions==
Alakh Niranjan was adapted into Indian films in 1940, 1950, and in 1975 by [[Babubhai Mistry]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/find?s=tt&amp;q=Alakh+Niranjan Alakh Niranjan] [[IMDB]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anejom̃''' or '''Aneityum''' (also spelled  ''Anejom'', and formerly ''Aneiteum'', ''Aneityumese'') is an [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic language]] spoken by 900 people ({{as of|2001|lc=on}})&lt;ref name=e18 /&gt; on [[Aneityum Island]], [[Vanuatu]].  It is the only indigenous language of Aneityum.&lt;ref group=gr name=":0"&gt;{{Page numbers|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
Anejom̃ is part of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family, and is part of the large subgroup of [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] [[Oceanic languages|languages]].  Anejom̃ falls under the [[Southern Oceanic languages|Southern Oceanic Languages]] subgroup, and more specifically Southern Vanuatuan Languages.&lt;ref group=gr name=":0" /&gt;  It constitutes its own separate branch of Southern Vanuatuan languages.  While Anejom̃ is now considered to be only one language, some historical reports have suggested that Anejom̃ might have consisted of two very distinct dialects.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Linguistic History of Southern Vanuatu|last=Lynch|first=John|publisher=Pacific Linguistics|year=2001|isbn=|location=Canberra, Australia|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its closest relatives are preliminarily thought to be more closely related to the languages of Tanna (e.g. Kwamera, South-West Tanna, Lenakel) than Erromango languages.&lt;ref group=gr name=":0" /&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:New Hebrides.JPG|thumb|Map of Vanuatu (Formerly known as the New Hebrides)|left]]
The island of Aneityum is the southernmost inhabited island of the nation of Vanuatu.  It is closest to the islands of [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]] and [[Futuna Island, Vanuatu|Futuna]].&lt;ref group=gr name=":0" /&gt;  The island's geographic location made Anejom̃ develop in isolation.&lt;ref group=gr name=":0" /&gt;  The first speakers of the language are believed to have lived on hillsides near coasts in order to access resources.  However, due to land degradation and population pressure, the speakers moved to the valleys.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
Aneityum is thought to have been settled around 874 BCE +/- 60 years by people coming over from Tanna.  Original settlers (and speakers of the language) are thought to have lived on hillsides near the coasts in order to access resources from the ocean and land.&lt;ref group=gr name=":9" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the combination of land degradation and population forced the Aneityumese to move onto valley flats instead.&lt;ref group=gr name=":9" /&gt;

The original political system was like much of Melanesia; it was composed of multiple chiefs (''natimarid)'' ruling over many chiefdoms (''neclau'').&lt;ref group=gr name=":0" /&gt;  According to oral tradition, the island had two chiefdoms but they split to then form seven chiefdoms each "further divided into a number of districts between fifty and sixty in number".&lt;ref group=gr name=":0" /&gt;

The first contact with Europeans was in 1830, when the brig ''Alpha'' landed in Aneityum with hopes of establishing a sandalwood trading business.&lt;ref group=gr name=":0" /&gt;

The population of the Aneityumese has greatly declined over the years (along with the number of speakers); however, the population has seen a bit of a resurgence in the present.  Most of the population was decimated by two major epidemics in the 1830s and 1840s and never fully recovered as can be seen below:&lt;ref group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Church Presence ===
Like much of the rest of Melanesia, the church has played an important role in language ideology on Aneityum.  The first missionaries to land on the island were Samoan Presbyterians who arrived in 1841.  After them followed European Presbyterian missionaries who established themselves in 1848.&lt;ref group=gr name=":0" /&gt;  With the large missionary presence on the island, many schools were founded to spread the message of Christianity.  In these schools, the classroom was mainly conducted in Anejom̃, however numeracy was conducted in English.&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;Lynch, John Dominic. Church, State and Language in Melanesia: An Inaugural Lecture. Papua New Guinea: U of Papua New Guinea, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;  The missionary presence on the island was so prevalent that the island was considered the "first successfully missionized island in Melanesia" and housed the headquarters of the Presbyterian Mission to the New Hebrides.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The missions on Aneityum promoted the use of English.

=== Colonialization ===
Vanuatu came under joint British and French rule in 1887, which then became formalized in 1906 where Vanuatu became known as the "Anglo-French Condominium".  Colonialization along with the big mission presence on the island led to the languages of French and English to become prestige languages.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;  Other languages of Vanuatu also became prestigious (such as Nguna) because these language were chosen by missionaries to spread their teachings.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;  With prolonged contact with English speakers, another language also arose: Bislama.  Bislama, a pidgin of English, is now an extremely widely used language and has had a huge role in language change within Anejom̃.

== Phonology and Orthography ==

=== Phonemes ===
Anejom̃ has 5 vowels and 20 or 21 consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phoible.org/inventories/view/1228|title=PHOIBLE Online -|website=phoible.org|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sound [ʔ] is sometimes counted as phoneme.&lt;ref group=gr name=":0" /&gt; Vowel and consonant length is contrastive in this language and is shown in [[orthography]] by writing the vowel or consonant twice.

=== Orthography ===
Anejom̃ was never a written language and so traditionally did not have an orthography.  The first orthography was made by the missionary John Inglis in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/adictionaryanei00aneigoog|title=A dictionary of the Aneityumese language. In two parts. I. Aneityumese and English. II. English and Aneityumese. Also outlines of Aneityumese grammar. And an introduction, containing notices of the missions to the native races, and illustrations of the principles and peculiarities of the Aneityumese language|last=Inglis|first=John|date=1882-01-01|publisher=London, Williams &amp;amp; Norgate}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was considered to be a fairly good orthography of its time (having a one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes), however it did contain several key problems.  
# It did not distinguish between /pʷ/ and /p/ and /mʷ/ and /m/.&lt;ref group=gr name=":2" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The phoneme /ɲ/ was not always written as a separate letter from other nasal phonemes.&lt;ref group=gr name=":2" /&gt;
# The allophone of /e/, [ə], was written confusingly as "''eu".''&lt;ref group=gr name=":2" /&gt;
# Palatal off-glide before a palatal consonant was denoted as an "''i".''&lt;ref group=gr name=":2" /&gt;
# Vowel and consonant length were not represented consistently in the orthography.&lt;ref group=gr name=":2" /&gt;
A new orthography more accepted by Anejom̃ speakers now is shown below.

=== &lt;u&gt;Allophones&lt;/u&gt; ===

==== Glottal Stop ====
The moderately phonemic glottal stop is an allophone of /h/ when it occurs before a consonant.&lt;ref group=gr name=":3" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also occurs as an allophone before vowels that occur in the word initial position.&lt;ref group=gr name=":3" /&gt;

===== Nasals =====
The phoneme /ɲ/ becomes [j̃] after a high vowel.&lt;ref group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Voicing ====
Stops and affricates in Anejom̃ change in voicing depending where they occur between [[Segment (linguistics)|segment]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s as described and illustrated below.&lt;ref group=gr name=":4"&gt;{{Page numbers|14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Between vowels labial stops become voiced.  Other stops (and affricates) are partially voiced.&lt;ref group=gr name=":4" /&gt;  
* Between voiced segments all stops are variably voiced.  The affricate /tʃ/ is variably voiced between voiced segments too.  However, when it occurs before a nasal segment it becomes [[Voiceless palatal stop|[c]]].&lt;ref group=gr name=":4" /&gt;
* When these stops occur word initially, they are always slightly aspirated.  The affricate /tʃ/ on the other hand is not aspirated but often takes on variable voicing.&lt;ref group=gr name=":4" /&gt;
* When these stops and affricates don't occur between vowels or voiced segments they stay as their underlying form.  For example, /p/ becomes [p] and /k/ becomes [k].&lt;ref group=gr name=":4" /&gt;
* When these stops occur in final position, the phonemes don't change.  However, the affricate /tʃ/ becomes [[Voiceless palatal stop|[c]]].&lt;ref group=gr name=":4" /&gt;

== Morphology ==

=== &lt;u&gt;Pronouns&lt;/u&gt; ===
There are three types of pronouns in Anejom̃: personal, demonstrative and interrogative pronouns.&lt;ref group=gr name=":0" /&gt;

==== Personal Pronouns ====
Anejom̃ "[[personal pronoun]]s distinguish (a) three persons, with a further distinction of inclusive and exclusive in first person non-singular; (b) four numbers (singular, dual, trial and plural); and (c) three cases (focal, [[Object pronoun|object]] and [[Possessive pronoun|possessive]])."&lt;ref group=gr name=":0" /&gt;  The table below shows all of the personal pronouns.&lt;ref group=gr name=":5"&gt;{{Page numbers|37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Focal Pronouns =====
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The focal pronouns ''aek'' and ''aen'' are only used in writing or when a speaker speaks slowly.  Most of the time the pronouns aak and aan, respectively, are used instead (and are generally pronounced with short vowels instead of long vowels).&lt;ref group=gr name=":5" /&gt;  Below is an example of a focal pronoun.&lt;ref group=gr name=":6"&gt;{{Page numbers|38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Et              amjeg      &lt;u&gt;aan*&lt;/u&gt;''

3SG.AR    sleep       (s)he

'He/she/it is sleeping.'

===== Object Pronouns =====
Object pronouns are free morphemes and occur after verbs and certain "case-marking prepositions" as seen below. &lt;ref group=gr name=":6" /&gt;

''Arodei   &lt;u&gt;ra&lt;/u&gt;              aak!''

whip      them.PL     you.SG

'Whip them!'

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt;The 2SG and 3SG object pronouns normally occur as yic and yin, however when a vowel precedes these pronouns then they change to the suffixes  -c and -n respectively.&lt;ref group=gr name=":6" /&gt;

''*Et              emtita-i        &lt;u&gt;yic&lt;/u&gt;               aan.           -----&gt;         Et             emitita-&lt;u&gt;c&lt;/u&gt;           aan.''

3SG.AR     fear-TR       you.SG.O   (s)he            ''-----&gt;''         3SG.AR    fear-2SG.O      (s)he

'He's frightened of you'

===== Possessive Pronouns =====
Possessive pronouns occur as suffixes and can be attached to "directly possessed nouns and possessive markers, some case-markers, and to members of one sub-class of verbs".&lt;ref group=gr name=":7" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|39}}&lt;/ref&gt; See below.

''Alum̃a-&lt;u&gt;k&lt;/u&gt;                   ti         aak''

give.to.drink-my       tea      you.SG

'Give me some tea (to drink).'

==== &lt;u&gt;Interrogative Pronouns&lt;/u&gt; ====
There are two interrogative pronouns in Anejom̃: ''di'' ('who') and ''panid'' and its less widely used alternate, ''panida'' ('which').&lt;ref group=gr name=":7" /&gt;

''Et                  adel   a     &lt;u&gt;di?&lt;/u&gt;''

3SG.AR        fart     S    who

'Who farted?'

However, ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'di''' is "inherently singular" and requires a coordinate phrase with ''im,'' as seen in the example here, to express plurality.&lt;ref group=gr name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref group=gr name=":8" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Era          apam   &lt;u&gt;di        im      di?&lt;/u&gt;''

3PL.AR   come   who     and   who

'Who (PL) came?"

''Panid'' and ''Panida'' can only be used to refer to inanimate objects.&lt;ref group=gr name=":8" /&gt;

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Le             naifi      enai             aak!'''

take.SG     knife     DEM2.SG   you.SG

'''&lt;u&gt;Panid?'&lt;/u&gt;''

which.one

==== &lt;u&gt;Demonstrative Pronouns&lt;/u&gt; ====
[[Demonstrative|Demonstrative Pronouns]] also have singular, dual, trial and plural forms like personal pronouns (see below).&lt;ref group=gr name=":8" /&gt;

In Anejom̃, demonstrative pronouns can also take the suffix ''-sak'' which denotes that the speaker is "pointing at or in some other way indicating the location of the thing referred to."&lt;ref group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Alp̃a-i       ñak   &lt;u&gt;jeknaa-sak&lt;/u&gt;          aak.''

give-TR   me    this2.PL-INDIC   you.SG

'Give me those ones there (that I'm pointing at).'

=== Nouns ===
Anejom̃ has several categories for nouns: temporal, locative, personal, obligatorily possessed and optionally possessed nouns.  The latter two categories (obligatorily possessed and optionally possessed nouns), are further distinguished based on animacy (as seen below).&lt;ref group=gr name=":10"&gt;{{Page numbers|42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Temporal Nouns ====

|-
|invid

|-

|}

==== Locative Nouns ====
Locative nouns in Anejom̃ do not need the case marker "''a"'' to occur in front of it as shown in the example below.&lt;ref group=gr name=":11" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Et m̃an apan aan &lt;u&gt;Isia&lt;/u&gt;''

3SG.AR PF go (s)he Isia.

'He went to Isia.'

Locative nouns also include the following words:&lt;ref group=gr name=":11" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
!Anejom̃
!English
|-
|ijiñis
|above
|-
|ijhou
|outside
|-
|itohou
|far inland
|-
|itac
|behind
|-
|up̃os
|on land, in a clear place
|}

==== Personal Nouns ====
Personal Nouns include kinship terms as well as names of people.&lt;ref group=gr name=":11" /&gt;

==== Obligatorily Possessed Nouns ====
These nouns must "be marked as being possessed by some other noun or pronoun", which tends to be marked by suffixation.&lt;ref group=gr name=":12" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the obligatorily possessed nouns are kinship terms.&lt;ref group=gr name=":12" /&gt;

An example of direct suffixation can be seen in the examples below.&lt;ref group=gr name=":12" /&gt;

''etma-n''

father-his/her

'his/her father'

''etma-ra''

father-their.PL

'their father'

There are some nouns that do not take direct suffixation but rather use [[Possession (linguistics)|possessive markers]] such as the word for "child", "nephew", "niece", and "sister," to name a few.&lt;ref group=gr name=":12" /&gt;

==== Optionally Possessed Nouns ====
Unlike obligatorily possessed nouns, these nouns do not, or do not have to, take possession markers.

===== Animate and Inanimate Nouns =====
Anejom̃ has a distinction between [[Animate noun|animate]] and [[Animacy|inanimate]] nouns which is further divided into obligatorily possessed and optionally possessed nouns.&lt;ref group=gr name=":13" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|45-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animate nouns are usually marked by using the subject marker "''a"'' for singular and the prefix ''"elpu-"'' for plural''.''&lt;ref group=gr name=":13" /&gt;

''Et alp̃as &lt;u&gt;a pikad&lt;/u&gt; uñu-m̃.''

3SG.AR big S pig POSS.G-your.SG

'Your pig is (getting) big.'

Pluralization of the word meaning 'man' to 'men' seen below.&lt;ref group=gr name=":13" /&gt;

''natam̃añ → elpu-atam̃añ''

Inanimate nouns are not marked in either the singular or plural.

=== Noun Prefixes ===
Anejom̃ has several key prefixes that serve important roles:&lt;ref group=gr name=":14" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|46-47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
!Prefix
!Function
!Example
|-
| rowspan="2" |''n- / in-''
(''-in'' is used before

a consonant)
|adding this prefix makes verbs into nouns
|''omrag''  (be old)  → ''n-omrag''  (old person)
|-
|also produces nominalized verbs
|''Nai     meret       aek        &lt;u&gt;n-apan&lt;/u&gt;   va-ñ           Vila   ka   a'o?''
2SG.  ARwant   you.SG   N-go      PURP-TR   Vila   or   no

'Do you want to go to Vila?'

|-
|''*inta-''
|makes instrumental nouns from verbs
|''ahrei'' (to sleep)  → ''inta-ahrei''  (broom)
|-
|''nupu-''
|makes "human nouns from locative nouns or other locationally-oriented forms".&lt;ref group=gr name=":14" /&gt;

(Human nouns are nouns that mean 'a person from that place'.)
|''Samoa'' (Samoa) → ''nupu-Samoa'' (a Samoan)
|-
|''elpu-''
|plural form of ''nupu-'' (has the same function)
|''Samoa'' (Samoa) → ''elpu-Samoa'' (Samoans)
|-
|''nef(e)-''
|signals importance or size
|''natimi'' (person) → ''nef-atimi'' (an important person)
|-
|''nev(e)-''
|'which?'
|''nelcau'' (canoe) →''nev-elcau'' (which canoe)
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Inta-'' is used sparingly compared to the other prefixes.  Most of the time, instrumental nouns are compounds that include the word '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''nitai','' which is most likely where ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'inta''' comes from.&lt;ref group=gr name=":14" /&gt;

==== N-/in- Prefix ====
The ''n-''/''in-'' prefix is a frequently used as well as frequently occurring [[Underlying representation|underlying morpheme]]: it accounts for around 85% of Anejom̃ nouns.&lt;ref group=gr name=":15" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|48-49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other approximate 15% of nouns that don't use this prefix tend to be highly specific groups of nouns.&lt;ref group=gr name=":15" /&gt;

==== Collective Prefixes ====
Anejom̃ also has a different set of prefixes that are referred to as collective prefixes as they refer to large groups of things:&lt;ref group=gr name=":16" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
!Collective Prefix
!Meaning
|-
|niji-
|"general collective prefix used with a wide variety of nouns"&lt;ref group=gr name=":16" /&gt;
|-
|nupu- 
(not the same nupu- prefix

in the previous table)
|used for humans and higher animates
|-
|inlel-
|used for inanimates (most likely things that occur in nature)
|-
|inmal-
|used for inanimate (most likely artefacts)
|}

=== Noun Suffixes ===

==== Direct Possession ====
In Anejom̃, the possessive form of personal pronouns are attached directly to the noun when "the possessor is a personal pronoun".&lt;ref group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|57-58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''nijma-k''

hand-my

'my hand'

==== Indirect Possession ====
For all other nouns that cannot be directly possessed, a "possessive or construct suffix is added to a possessive marker" as seen below. &lt;ref group=gr name=":17" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|59-62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''intal &lt;u&gt;inca-i di?&lt;/u&gt;''

taro POSS.F-CS who

'whose taro?'
{| class="wikitable"
! colspan="2" |Possessive Markers 
|-
|inca-
|possession of food
|-
|lum̃a
|possession of drink
|-
|lida-
|possession of "something to suck the juice from"&lt;ref group=gr name=":17" /&gt;
|-
|um̃a-
|possession of a "customarily owned area of land or sea"&lt;ref group=gr name=":17" /&gt;
|-
|a, era-
|passive or subordinate possession
|-
|u, uwu-
|general possession
|}

=== Verbs ===
Verbs in Anejom̃ are words that can occur as the head of a verb phrase.&lt;ref group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Anejom̃, verbs are distinguished by transitivity; there are [[Transitive verb|transitive]], [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] and (the family small class of) [[Ambitransitive verb|ambi-transitive]] verbs.  Examples of these verbs can be seen below.&lt;ref group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|67-69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
!
!Verb
!Meaning
|-
|Transitive
|''ciñ, awod, alcajira-ñ, hag*''
|'eat', 'hit', 'tie up', 'eat' (TRANS)
|-
|Intransitive
|''aco, epehtau, amjeg, ciñ*''
|'forage for shellfish', 'to stumble/trip', 'to sleep', to eat (INTR)
|-
|Ambi-Transitive
|''atapanes, ataktai, asalgei''
|'shut, close' , 'think, think about', 'open'
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Many transitive verbs also have intransitive pairings as can be seen by the two verbs that mean 'to eat' in the table above.

==== The Verbs ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'yek'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' and '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''isp̃a''' ====
Both of these verbs are unusual in that they do not follow the regular pattern.

===== '''Yek''&lt;nowiki/&gt;': to be at, be present =====
''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Yek''' is an existential verb that is different from the majority of Anejom̃ verbs in a number of ways.
# The root of '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''yek''' changes irregularly in the singular, dual and trial forms.&lt;ref group=gr name=":19" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|73-76}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The verb does not take subject-tense markers, though it does take certain aspect-mood markers.&lt;ref group=gr name=":19" /&gt;
# Pronoun subjects come after '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''yek'''&lt;ref group=gr name=":19" /&gt;
# Noun phrases normally come before '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''yek''' instead of after and don't take the subject marker ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'a'.''&lt;ref group=gr name=":19" /&gt;
# It has specific markers it can and cannot occur with.&lt;ref group=gr name=":19" /&gt;

===== Isp̃a =====
This verb marks the [[Reflexive verb|reflexive]] or reciprocal and takes an agreeing possessive suffix as seen below.&lt;ref group=gr name=":19" /&gt;

''Et &lt;u&gt;isp̃a-n&lt;/u&gt; edel aan.''

3SG.AR REFL-its grow it

'It grew by itself'.

==== Inflectional Prefixes ====

|}
&lt;ref group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|80-82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vowel (i) is only added if it occurs before a consonant.&lt;ref group=gr name=":18" /&gt;

==== Reduplication ====
Anejom̃ does have [[reduplication]] although it is not used very often.  It most commonly occurs as complete reduplication as seen below.&lt;ref group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|82}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
!Noun

|erop̃
|'slow'
|erop̃-erop̃
|'too/very slow'
|}

==== Object Suffixes for Transitive Verbs ====
Not including the verbs which take possessive suffixes, there are three main types of ways in which transitive verbs are marked.  The types of verbs are: 1) unmarked verbs, 2) "verbs that take the transitive suffix "-''i"'' with all objects", 3) verbs that only take "-''i"'' with animate objects and ''"-ñ"'' with inanimate objects.&lt;ref group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|84-85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"

!Type 2 Verb
!Type 3 Verb
|-
!Animate Object
| -----
| -i
| -i
|-
!Inanimate Object
| ------
| -i
| -ñ
|}

==== Directional and Locational Verb Suffixes ====
These suffixes attach to the end of the verb and will come after a transitive suffix if one occurs.&lt;ref group=gr name=":18"&gt;{{Page numbers|85-87}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{| class="wikitable"
! colspan="6" |Direction/Locational Suffixes

!-kou
|distant
|-
!-p̃ok
|seawards

|
|-
!-pahai
|landwards, inland
|
|
|}
Distance suffixes have to combine with horizontal or vertical suffixes; they cannot be alone.&lt;ref group=gr name=":18" /&gt;  The ordering of these suffixes are as follows: 1) VERTICAL, 2) HORIZONTAL, 3) DISTANCE.&lt;ref group=gr name=":18" /&gt;

==== Subject-Tense Marking ====
In a verb phrase, a subject marking morpheme tends to occur first (except if it is an imperative, optionally conjoined, or subordinate clause).&lt;ref group=gr name=":20" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|89-91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Anejom̃, subject-tense-aspect marking is undergoing radical change.&lt;ref group=gr name=":20" /&gt;

==== Mood, Aspect, Tense Markers ====
Anejom̃ has several markers (different than the subject-markers) which indicate a variety of mood, aspect and tense.&lt;ref group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|97}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
! colspan="2" |Mood, Aspect, Tense Markers

=== Compounding ===
Compounding is a key historical and modern feature of Anejom̃; it has both compound nouns and compound verbs.&lt;ref group=gr name=":21"&gt;{{Page numbers|105-111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Compound nouns generally consist of a noun followed by either a noun, verb, modifier or a possessive construction, and compound verbs tend to be a combination of two verbs, although sometimes a verb is followed by a noun.  Compounding is so prevalent, that historical linguistics use modern (as well as [[Fossilization (linguistics)|fossilized]] compounds) to trace genealogical relationships between Oceanic languages.  Another one of the key uses of compounding in Anejom̃, is it is used to form the instrumental case. Examples of compounding can be seen below.&lt;ref group=gr name=":21" /&gt;

== Syntax ==
Anejom̃ word order is fairly strict and does not allow for much variation.  The preferred word order in Anejom̃ is VOS (or verb, followed by object, then subject).  This word order is extremely unusual within the languages of Vanuatu and makes Anejom̃ the "only non-Polynesian language in Vanuatu to have this preferred word order."&lt;ref group=gr name=":22" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|114-115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Below are a couple of examples of intransitive and transitive sentences.&lt;ref group=gr name=":22" /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Intransitive Sentences&lt;/u&gt;

''[Et             apam]     [a        di].''

3SG.AR    come     S       who

‘Who’s coming?.’

[''Jim lav aak''].

DONT make.noise you.SG

'Don't (you sg.) make a noise!

&lt;u&gt;Transitive Sentence&lt;/u&gt;

[ ''Eris lecse-i''] [''isji-tal''] [''aarau''].

3PL.P take.PL-TR fruits-taro they.DL

'The two of them took the taro corms.'

=== Departures from VOS ===
While Anejom̃ has a fairly strict word order, there are times that the language departs from the standard VOS order.
# Although not very common, subjects and objects are moved to the beginning of the phrase when [[Topicalization|topicalized]].&lt;ref group=gr name=":22" /&gt;
# When an object is a fairly long word, it is switched with the subject making the order VSO instead.&lt;ref group=gr name=":22" /&gt;
# Indefinite subjects tend to come before verbs, making the order SVO.&lt;ref group=gr name=":22" /&gt;
# With the verb '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''yek''', pronoun subjects follow the verb but noun phrases come before it.&lt;ref group=gr name=":22" /&gt;

=== Cases ===
Anejom̃ has multiple cases that are denoted by several different case markers summed up below.&lt;ref group=gr name=":23" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indicating Time and Place ===
Temporal phrases can be marked with or without a case depending on the phrase.

==== Unmarked Phrases ====
Unmarked temporal phrases take a temporal noun and unmarked locative phrases take either a locative noun or a locative demonstrative.&lt;ref group=gr name=":24"&gt;{{Page numbers|120-122}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two types of local demonstratives: the first type is the one seen in the table below and the second is formed adding locative suffixes (see table earlier on page) to the root '''au'.''&lt;ref group=gr name=":24" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
! colspan="5" |Locative Demonstratives

Locative Demonstratives that are formed by adding the locative suffixes to the root ''au-'' must follow a specific order:&lt;ref group=gr name=":24" /&gt;

''au-'' VERTICAL - DISTANCE

''au-'' HORIZONTAL - DISTANCE

''au -'' VERTICAL - HORIZONTAL - DISTANCE

==== Marked Phrases ====
Marked temporal phrases and place phrases (that don't have a non-personal noun at the head), take the case marker ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'a'.''&lt;ref group=gr name=":25" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|123-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For non-personal place phrases, the case marker ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'u'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' is used instead.&lt;ref group=gr name=":25" /&gt;  When a place phrase uses a personal noun or pronoun, ''ehele-'' is used instead of either ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'a'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' or ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'u'''.&lt;ref group=gr name=":25" /&gt;

=== Questions ===
There are two types of questions: yes/no and content questions.

==== Yes/No Questions ====
Yes/no questions can be asked in two ways.  One way to indicate a question is by ending a phrase on a raised intonation.  The second way is to add the word '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''ka a'o'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' (which means '''or no''&lt;nowiki/&gt;') to the end of a sentence.&lt;ref group=gr name=":26" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|133-135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Content Questions =====
Unlike yes/no questions, content questions use interrogative morphemes such as:&lt;ref group=gr name=":26" /&gt;

'who': ''di''

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''what': ''inhe''

'which/which one': ''panid/panida''

'when': ''nuhup̃an''

'which/which thing': ''nev(e)-''

'where': ''eda'' (acts like a locative noun)

'how to': ''ehv(e)-'' (verbal prefix)

=== Combining Clauses ===
There are several different ways to combine clauses together:&lt;ref group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|140}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "simple clause chaining"
# conjunctions
# using ''am̃'' and ''p̃ar''
# the "echo-subject proclitic ''m-''
# verb serialization

==== Simple Clause Chaining ====
In simple clause chaining, no conjunctions are markings are used to link two separate clauses together.  Simple clause chaining can be used either for clauses of the same or different subject and for both verbal and verbless clauses.&lt;ref group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|141-143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[''Ekrau edou ajamrau''], [''ek ap̃ahni añak era-i iji-teptag asga''].

1EXC.DL.AR roam we.EXC.DL 1SG.AR go.everywhere I LOC-CS COL-nakamal all

'We wandered around and I went to every single nakamal.'

==== Conjunctions ====
There are three conjunctions that combine clauses in Anejom̃: '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''ka''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''jai','' and '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''jam''' which are the equivalents of 'or', 'but' and 'but' respectively.&lt;ref group=gr name=":27" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|143-147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Ka'

[''Et m̃an ecohos nagesga''] ''&lt;u&gt;ka&lt;/u&gt;'' [''a'o'']?

3SG.AR PF appear sun or no

'Has the sun risen (or not)?

'&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Jai''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' and '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Jam'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' have the same meaning, however ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'jai'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' is used when the subjects of the two combining clauses are different and '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''jam'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' is used when the two combining subjects are the same.&lt;ref group=gr name=":27" /&gt;  '''Jai''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' is also used when a subject-tense marker occurs at the beginning of the clause following it, regardless of the subject.&lt;ref group=gr name=":27" /&gt;

'Jai'&lt;ref group=gr name=":27" /&gt;

[''Eris akrou m-alp̃a-i cama''], &lt;u&gt;''jai''&lt;/u&gt; [''is p̃ar han'']...

3PL.P make kava POSS.D-his they.PL but.SS make 3SG.P two

'They made his kava, but they made two (bowls).'

==== ''Am̃'' and ''p̃ar'' ====
''Am̃'' and ''p̃ar'' are also conjunctions that respectively mean 'and' and 'and then, so'.  However, they don't function like normal conjunctions but rather aspect markers as seen below.&lt;ref group=gr name=":27" /&gt;

[''Ekris lecse-i u-rau aarau''], [''isam̃ atpu tah aarau]''.

3DL.P take.PL-TR POSS-3DL they.DL 3SG.P and hide one they.DL

'The two of them took their, and one of them hid.'

==== ''M-'' ====
''M-'' is attached "to the first word in the verb phrase of a non-initial clause which has the same subject as the preceding clause".&lt;ref group=gr name=":28" group=gr&gt;{{Page numbers|150-151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also denote continuous aspect.&lt;ref group=gr name=":28" /&gt;

[''Ekris apan aarau''] [&lt;u&gt;''m''&lt;/u&gt;''-ago nup̃ut''] [''&lt;u&gt;m&lt;/u&gt;''-''ago ihnii''].

3DL.P go they.DL ES-make k.o.laplap ES-make finish

'They two went and made nup̃ut and finished making it.'

==== Verb Serialization ====
While verb serialization does not occur much in Anejom̃ in comparison to other Western Oceanic Languages, it occurs more commonly than in its closest related languages.&lt;ref group=gr name=":28" /&gt; Most of the verb-serializations in Anejom̃ contain directional motion verbs in the non-initial clause as seen below:&lt;ref group=gr name=":28" /&gt;

[Is ''''m̃an lep rectidai aataj''''] [''&lt;u&gt;apan a-nlii-i niom̃&lt;/u&gt;'']

P PF again get.up they.TL go LOC-inside-CS house

'They three got up again and went inside the house.'

=== Relative Clauses ===
Relative clauses in Anejom̃ do not have relative pronouns and they directly follow the noun phrase that it is modifying.&lt;ref group=gr name=":29"&gt;{{Page numbers|155}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example:&lt;ref group=gr name=":29" /&gt;

[NP ''Inworen enaa'' [REL ''et amen aan im-le injap̃ era-n.'']REL]NP...

place DEM2.SG 3SG.AR stay he ES-take.SG salt LOC-its

'The place where he got salt from...'

{{redirect|The other place|other uses|The Other Place (disambiguation)}}

"''''Another place''''" or "''''the other place''''" is a [[euphemism]] used in many [[bicameral]] parliaments using the [[Westminster system]], including [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

A member of one house will not usually refer directly to the other, but refer to it indirectly using the phrase "another place" or "the other place". So, for example, a member of the [[Senate of Canada]] would not mention "the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]" but would use the phrase "the other place".

The tradition does not extend to business (such as speeches and interviews) conducted outside the house, and is generally dropped when a debate is directly addressing the nature of the other house, such as in debates on reform of the [[House of Lords]] in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Example from [[Hansard]] in 2011 to be found [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/110216-0001.htm#11021657001752 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons for the tradition are unclear, but it has been suggested that it dates back to a period of ill-feeling between the two houses of the UK Parliament. Similarly a member talking of their own house would refer to it as &lt;nowiki&gt;"this place"&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

==Other uses==
Similarly, the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] refer to each other as "the other place",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peetm.com/OxfordTerms.htm#The_other_place The other place] ''An Oxford Glossary of Terminology''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge/City-leaves-the-Other-Place-in-a-spin-over-cycling-race.htm |title=City leaves the Other Place in a spin over cycling race |first1=Chris |last1=Elliott |date=2010-07-14 |newspaper=Cambridge News |publisher=Cambridge Newspapers |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do the pupils of the British public schools [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Harrow School|Harrow]].

In some [[team sport]]s, an '''attacker''' is a specific type of player, usually involved in aggressive play. Heavy attackers are, usually, placed up front: their goal is to score the most possible points for the team.

In [[association football]], attackers are also referred to as [[Forward (association football)#Striker|strikers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1046">'''Aufidius Namusa''' was a Roman jurist and writer of the 1st century BC. He was one of the numerous pupils of [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]].  There were ten of Servius's students who wrote books (e.g. [[Alfenus Varus]]), and from the works of eight of them Namusa compiled a work which was distributed into one hundred and eighty parts or divisions (''libri'').  The work of Namusa is cited by [[Ulpian]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulpian]], Dig. 13. tit. 6. s. 5. § 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Javolenus,&lt;ref&gt;[[Javolenus]], Dig. 35. tit. 1. s. 40. § 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul (jurist)|Paulus]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Paul (jurist)|Paul]], Dig. 39. tit. 3. s. 2. § 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and we are thus made acquainted with some of the legal opinions of Servius.

The '''Bello orthography''' or '''Chilean orthography''' was a [[Spanish-language]] [[orthography]] created by the [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]] linguist [[Andrés Bello]] and Juan García del Río, published in London in 1823. Part of the orthography was used officially for a time in [[Chile]], and it influenced other [[Spanish-speaking countries]]. The aim of the orthography was a [[Phonemic orthography|perfect correspondence]] between [[graphemes]] and [[phonemes]]. The reform did not succeed. Standard [[Spanish orthography]] as used for [[Spanish language in the Americas|Hispanic American Spanish]] contains several [[homophones]] (⟨c⟩, ⟨k⟩, ⟨qu⟩; ⟨c⟩, ⟨s⟩, ⟨z⟩; ⟨g⟩, ⟨j⟩, ⟨x⟩; ⟨b⟩, ⟨v⟩; ⟨y⟩, ⟨ll⟩; ⟨i⟩, ⟨y⟩) or letters that represent more than one sound (⟨c⟩, ⟨g⟩, ⟨r⟩, ⟨x⟩, ⟨y⟩), and other variances (⟨h⟩; ⟨u⟩ after ⟨g⟩ and ⟨q⟩). Bello proposed several modifications that he believed should be undertaken in two stages:

*First stage:
# Substitute ⟨j⟩ for [[Hard and soft G|"weak" ⟨g⟩ sounds]] (''{{wiktes|jeneral}}'', ''{{wiktes|jinebra}}'');
# Substitute ⟨z⟩ for [[Hard and soft C|"weak" ⟨c⟩ sounds]] (''{{wiktes|zerdo}}'', ''{{wiktes|zisma}}'');
# Remove silent ⟨h⟩s (''{{wiktes|ombre}}'') and the silent ⟨u⟩ of ⟨qu⟩- (''{{wiktes|qeso}}'');
# Substitute ⟨i⟩ for ⟨y⟩s used as vowels (''{{wiktes|rei}}'', ''{{wiktes|i}}'');
# Always write ⟨rr⟩ where a rolled ⟨r⟩ is pronounced (''{{wiktes|rrazón}}'', ''{{wiktes|alrrededor}}'').

*Second stage:
#Substitute ⟨q⟩ for "strong" c sounds (''{{wiktes|qasa}}'');
#Remove the silent ⟨u⟩ in ⟨gu⟩- (''{{wiktes|gerra}}'', ''{{wiktes|ginda}}'').

On October 17, 1843, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (the Bello rector of the University of Chile) presented a project to the Faculty of Humanities and Philosophy: ''Report on American Orthography''.[http://www.proyectosarmiento.com.ar/trabajos.pdf/memoriaortografia.pdf]

On February 19, 1844, the Faculty judged the reform to be radical, but recommended some of Bello's ideas. The government of Chile followed this recommendation and that year introduced the following reforms:
#Substituting ⟨j⟩ for "weak" ⟨g⟩ sounds (''{{wiktes|jeneral}}'', ''{{wiktes|jinebra}}'')
#Substituting ⟨i⟩ for ⟨y⟩ used as vowels (''{{wiktes|rei}}'', ''{{wiktes|i}}'');
#Writing ⟨s⟩ instead of ⟨x⟩ before consonants (''{{wiktes|testo}}'').

The changes influenced [[Argentina]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Venezuela]]. With time, however, Spanish orthography returned to how it had been previously. The last country to return to standard orthography was Chile, where President [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]] established the use of [[Real Academia Española|RAE]] orthography in teaching and official documents in Decree No. 3,876 of July 20, 1927, going into effect on October 12, 1927.

The poet and Nobel Prize winner [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]] used an orthography similar to that of Bello in his work.

{{unreferenced|date=November 2016}}
'''Dead on arrival''' ('''DOA'''), also '''dead in the field''' and '''brought in dead''' ('''BID''') indicates that a patient was found to be already [[Clinical death|clinically dead]] upon the arrival of professional medical assistance, often in the form of [[first responder]]s such as [[emergency medical technician]]s, [[paramedic]]s, or [[police]].

In some jurisdictions, first responders must consult verbally with a [[physician]] before officially pronouncing a patient deceased, but once [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] is initiated, it must be continued until a physician can pronounce the patient dead.

==Medical DOA==
When presented with a patient, medical professionals are required to perform [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) unless specific conditions are met which allow them to pronounce the patient as deceased. In most places, these are examples of such criteria:
* Injuries not compatible with life. These include but are not necessarily limited to [[decapitation]] or other catastrophic brain trauma, [[incineration]], severed body, and injuries that do not permit effective administration of CPR. If a patient has sustained such injuries, it should be intuitively obvious that the patient is non-viable. 
* ''[[Rigor mortis]]'', indicating that the patient has been dead for at least a few hours. ''Rigor mortis'' can sometimes be difficult to determine, so it is often used reported along with other determining factors.
* Obvious [[Decomposition#Stages of decomposition|decomposition]].
* ''[[Livor mortis]]'' (lividity), indicating that the body has been pulseless and in the same position long enough for blood to sink and collect within the body, creating purplish discolorations at the lowest points of the body (with respect to [[gravity]]).
* [[Stillbirth]]. If it can be determined without a doubt that an infant died prior to birth, as indicated by skin blisters, an unusually soft head, and an extremely offensive odor, resuscitation should not be attempted. If there is even the slightest hope that the infant is viable, CPR should be initiated; some jurisdictions maintain that life-saving efforts should be attempted on all infants to assure parents that [[Futile care|all possible actions were performed to save their child, futile as the medical professionals may have known them to be]]. 
* Identification of valid [[do not resuscitate]] orders.

This list may not be a comprehensive picture of medical practice in all jurisdictions or conditions. For example, it may not represent the standard of care for patients with terminal diseases such as advanced cancer. In addition, jurisdictions such as [[Texas]] permit withdrawal of medical care from patients who are deemed unlikely to recover. {{further|Texas Futile Care Law}}

Regardless of the patient, a pronouncement of [[death]] must always be made with absolute certainty and only after it has been determined that the patient is not a candidate for resuscitation. This type of decision is rather sensitive and can be difficult to make.

Legal definitions of death vary from place to place; for example, irreversible brain-stem death, prolonged [[clinical death]],  etc.

==Colloquial use==
*When, as with computers, product complexity is high and diagnostics are involved, the medical metaphor is perhaps appropriate, as [[boot image control|complex diagnostics]] might be required to determine if the product "is really dead".
*In another context, "dead on arrival" may be used to describe an idea or product that is considered to be fundamentally flawed, and therefore viewed as an utter failure from the start.

'''Futunan''' or '''Futunian''' is the [[Polynesian language]] spoken on [[Futuna Island, Wallis and Futuna|Futuna]] (and Alofi). The term '''East-Futunan''' is also used to distinguish it from the related [[Futuna-Aniwan|West Futunan]] (Futuna-Aniwan) spoken on the [[Polynesian outlier|outlier]] islands of [[Futuna Island, Vanuatu|Futuna]] and [[Aniwa Island|Aniwa]] in [[Vanuatu]].

The language is closely related to other Western Polynesian languages, Fagauvea, Wallisian, Tongan, Samoan, Tokelau, and Niuafo’ou.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/fud|title=Futuna, East|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is classified as Austronesian, Malayo-Polynesian, Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Oceanic, Central-Eastern Oceanic, Remote Oceanic, Central Pacific, East Fijian-Polynesian, Polynesian, Nuclear, Samoic-Outlier, Futunic, Futuna, East.

Ca. 1987, Fakafutuna was spoken by 3,600 on Futuna, as well as by some of the 3,000 migrant workers in [[New Caledonia]].&lt;ref name=e16/&gt;

This language is a member of the [[List of endangered languages of the Pacific|diminishing set of native Pacific languages]], it is classified as endangered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/610522460|title=Atlas of the world's languages in danger|date=2010|publisher=Unesco|others=Moseley, Christopher., Nicolas, Alexandre., Unesco., Unesco.

== History ==
King [[Sigave]] signed a treaty establishing a French protectorate on 16 February 1888, after being pressured by missionaries to do so. The islands were put under the authority of the [[French colonial empire|French colony]] of [[New Caledonia]]. In 1917, the three traditional kingdoms of Wallis, Futuna and Alofi were annexed as colonies of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The American Battle Monuments Commission and World War II, 1939–1945|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv3znxtf.11|work=War and Remembrance|pages=143–175|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|isbn=9780813176338|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 citizens voted on becoming a French oversea's territory, legally unionizing Wallis and Futuna despite the fact that the islands are home to two distinct Polynesian societies with different cultures. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Geoffrey M|date=2015|title=Tiki Pop: America Imagines Its Own Polynesian Paradise, and: Tiki Pop: America Imagines Its Own Polynesian Paradise by Sven Kirsten|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/cp.2015.0029|journal=The Contemporary Pacific|volume=27|issue=2|pages=560–565|doi=10.1353/cp.2015.0029|issn=1527-9464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being a French colony, Futunan remained relatively protected from the linguistic consequences of European language domination. The situation began to change around the second World War when the numbers of speakers started to decline dramatically. A major event in the decline was the immigration of a large number of native Futunian speakers to New Caledonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Delayed Impact: Postcolonial Language Problems in the French Overseas Territory Wallis and Futuna (Central Polynesia)|last=Rensch|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; French has since enveloped Futunan in society, becoming the primary language used in grade schools. Futunans speak and use their language daily, mainly only using French in contact with European natives, or within the educational spheres. RFO-radio airs 15 minutes daily news broadcasts in Futunan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sorosoro.org/en/futunan/|title=Futunan «  Sorosoro|website=www.sorosoro.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Phonology ==

Futunan has five vowels; a, e (/e/), i, o, u (/u/) which can be short or long. Long vowels are denoted by a macron: ā, ē, ī, ō, ū. Futunan has 11 consonants: 4 plosives (p, k, t, and a glottal stop /ʔ/, noted by an apostrophe); 3 nasals m, n, and g (/ŋ/) and 4 fricatives f, v, l, and s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionnaire futunien-français avec index français-futunien|last=Moyse-Faurie|first=Claire|publisher=Peeter Selaf|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; /ŋ/ corresponds to the sound ng as in "parking".

The Futunan has a syllabic structure of CVCV type, which means that two consonants are necessarily separated by a vowel; The opposite is not true (examples: ''eio'' (yes), ''tauasu'' (meeting where one drinks kava), ''aua'' (particle of the negative imperative), etc.). Words end with a vowel.

=== Pronouns ===

The third person pronoun is now rarely used in Futunan. For all pronoun references, except third person singular, Futunan offers a choice of [http://www.englicious.org/lesson/preposing-and-postposing pre-posed and post-posed] pronouns, which are pronouns placed before or after the subject. Modern Futunan has done away with the possibility of expressing pre-posed and post-posed pronouns. Clitic pronouns (clitic pronouns are dependent on an adjacent word and cannot stand on their own in meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-clitic-words-1689757|title=How Clitics Are Used in English Morphology and Phonology|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of the first and second type may correspond to different types of arguments: the absolute of intransitive clauses, the [[Ergative case|ergative]] of transitive clauses, and the absolute of transitive clauses. In some cases unique to the Polynesian language family, Futunan uses a pre-posed pronoun to refer to the patient of an ergative verb. In casual conversation the use of a pre-verbal pronoun can be rather frequent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moyse-Faurie|first=Claire|date=1997|title=Syntactic and Pragmatic Functions of Pronominal Arguments in Some Western Polynesian Languages|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3623069|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|volume=36|issue=1|pages=6–28|doi=10.2307/3623069}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Futunan makes extensive syntactic use of pre-posed pronouns in conversation, where post-posed pronouns are used more in tails. Sentences containing post-posed pronouns only have two possible word orders: VAO (Verb, Adverb, Object) or VOA (Verb, Object, Adverb) (Example: etusi'i a au e lātou ke kau ano o fakafofoga loku fā kolo i le aso o Toloke. "They represented me to go and represent the village at the festivities in Toloke"). Co-occurring clitic and post-posed pronouns seem to have given way to the unique occurrence of post-posed pronouns with similar focusing functions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=Ross|last2=Chung|first2=Sandra|date=March 1981|title=Case Marking and Grammatical Relations in Polynesian|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/414294|journal=Language|volume=57|issue=1|pages=198|doi=10.2307/414294|issn=0097-8507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verbs ===

The marker 'a' is required before definite plural nouns and noun phrases, post-verbal pronominals and proper nouns, however it is not required for phrases preceded by an article or possessive pronoun. The marker 'e' is used in front of [[Ergative case|ergative]] arguments. The markers 'i' and 'ki' cover a range of meanings and satisfy a range of conditions. Most commonly the objects of 'i' are obligatory, while only some objects of 'ki' are. They are used extensively as directional, causal, or instrumental case markers. They refer to destination, aim or purpose as well as verbs of feeling, address or sensation.

The verb classes consists of [[Impersonal verb|impersonal]], [[Intransitive verb|intransitive (A/A + I)]], middle (A + Ki), [[Transitive verb|transitive]] (A + E), "AA + E", "AA + I" or AA + E" verbs. most AA + I and A + E verbs undergo [http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/latin/derivation-verbs derivation] to change their argument structure. Futunan has single, double and triple argument structures. Suffixes 'i' and 'ki' are used to derive verbs, the only productive suffix is 'a' which means "be full of". If an absolute argument in a sentence with a non-derived verb represents an agent, it will be marked as an [[Ergative case|ergative]], and a patient will be added in the absolute case (Example: "kutu" means lice. "kutu-a" means be covered with lice). if an absolutive argument represents a patient in a sentence with a derived verb, it will contain an additional ergative argument (Example: "lamata" means tame "faka-lamata" means be tamed by). In the case of middle verbs with two arguments verb derivation results in the experiencer being placed in the ergative, and the argument placed in the absolutive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moyse-Faurie|first=Claire|date=1992|title=Verb Classes and Argument Structure Variation in Futunan|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3623015|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|volume=31|issue=2|pages=209–227|doi=10.2307/3623015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14893">'''Gay male speech''', particularly within [[North American English]], has been the focus of numerous modern stereotypes, as well as [[sociolinguistic]] studies. Scientific research has uncovered phonetically significant features produced by many [[gay men]] and demonstrated that listeners accurately guess speakers' [[sexual orientation]] at rates greater than chance.&lt;ref&gt;Gaudio, Rudolph (1994) "Sounding Gay: Pitch Properties in the Speech of Gay and Straight Men." ''American Speech'' 69: 30-57. Poster Presentation at the Annual Meeting of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, Miami, FL.&lt;/ref&gt; One feature of the speech is sometimes known as the "'''gay lisp'''", though researchers acknowledge that it is not technically a [[lisp]]. Research does not support the notion that gay speech entirely adopts feminine speech characteristics, but, rather, that it selectively adopts some of those features.&lt;ref&gt;Munson et al., 2006, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; Gay speech characteristics appear to be learned ways of speaking, though their origins and process of adoption by men remain unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Munson et al., 2006, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

==North American English==
Linguists have attempted to isolate exactly what makes gay men's English distinct from that of other demographics since the early 20th century, typically by contrasting it with straight male speech or comparing it to female speech.&lt;ref name=cam&gt;Cameron, Deborah, and Don Kulick. 2003. ''Language and Sexuality''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In older work, [[speech pathologist]]s often focused on high pitch among men, in its resemblance to women, as a defect.&lt;ref&gt;Travis, Lee Edward, ed. ''Handbook of Speech Pathology''. New York: Appleton, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[gay community]] consists of many smaller [[subculture]]s, it is likely inaccurate to presume all gay male speech falls under a single linguistically homogeneous category.&lt;ref name="pod"&gt;Podesva, Robert J., Sarah J. Roberts, and Kathryn Campbell-Kibler. "[http://web.stanford.edu/class/linguist156/Podesva_etal_2001.pdf Sharing Resources and Indexing Meanings in the Production of Gay Styles]." ''Language and Sexuality: Contesting Meaning in Theory and Practice'' (2001): 175–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gay lisp===
The gay lisp is one manner of speech stereotypically associated with gay speakers of American English, and perhaps other dialects or languages.&lt;ref name="Van Borsel"/&gt; It involves a [[Markedness|marked]] pronunciation of [[sibilant consonant]]s (particularly {{IPAc-en|s}} and {{IPAc-en|z}}).&lt;ref name="beyond"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.speech-language-therapy.com/codemix.htm |title=Beyond Lisping: Code Switching and Gay Speech Styles |last1=Bowen |first1=Caroline |year=2002 |accessdate=January 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027153157/http://speech-language-therapy.com/codemix.htm |archivedate=October 27, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macalester.edu/weekly/030102/myworld.html |title=Queering Multiculturalism |last1=McKinstry |first1=Oliver |date=March 1, 2002 |work=The Mac Weekly |publisher=Macalester College |accessdate=January 19, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922162200/http://www.macalester.edu/weekly/030102/myworld.html |archivedate=September 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Speech scientist]] [[Benjamin Munson (professor)|Benjamin Munson]] and his colleagues have argued that this is not a mis-articulated {{IPA|/s/}} (and therefore, not technically a [[lisp]]) as much as a hyper-articulated {{IPA|/s/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mack &amp; Munson, 2011, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, gay men are documented as pronouncing {{IPA|/s/}} with higher-frequency [[spectral density|spectral peaks]], an extremely negatively-[[Skewness|skewed]] spectrum, and a longer duration than heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;Munson et al., 2006, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linville, S.

[http://www.tc.umn.edu/~munso005/MunsonAndZimmerman.pdf Perceptual Bias and the Myth of the 'Gay Lisp']&lt;/ref&gt; (perhaps fewer than half),&lt;ref name="toronto"/&gt; and some carefully-speaking men who identify as heterosexual also produce this feature.&lt;ref name=munson/&gt;

===Vowels===
Gay men tend to [[raising (phonetics)|lower]] the {{sc|trap}} vowel (except before a [[nasal consonant]]) and the {{sc|dress}} vowel; this was specifically confirmed in a study of [[North-Central American English]] speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Munson et al., 2006, p. 214-5.&lt;/ref&gt; This linguistic phenomenon is normally associated with the [[Canadian shift|California vowel shift]] and also reported in a study of a gay speaker of [[California English]] itself, who strengthened these same features and also fronted the {{sc|goose}} and {{sc|goat}} vowels when speaking with friends more than in other speaking situations. Results suggest that a California regional sound can be employed by gay men for stylistic effect, including to evoke a "fun" or "partier" persona .&lt;ref&gt;Podesva, Robert J. (2011). "The California Vowel Shift and Gay Identity". ''American Speech'' 86 (1): 32–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other characteristics===
Some other speech features are also stereotyped as markers of gay or bisexual males: carefully enunciated pronunciation, wide pitch range (high and rapidly changing pitch), [[breathy voice]], lengthened [[fricative consonant|fricative]] sounds, and pronunciation of {{IPA|/t/}} as {{IPA|/ts/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} as {{IPA|/dz/}} ([[affricate consonant|affrication]]), etc.&lt;ref name="beyond"/&gt; Research shows that gay speech characteristics include many of the same characteristics other speakers use when attempting to speak with special carefulness or clarity, including over-articulating and expanding the vowel spaces in the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Munson et al., 2006, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perception===
In terms of perception, the "gay sound" in North American English is popularly presumed to involve the pronunciation of [[sibilant]]s ({{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, {{IPA|/ʃ/}}) with noticeable [[assibilation]], sibilation, hissing, or stridency.&lt;ref name="beyond"/&gt; [[Fronting (phonetics)|Frontal]], [[dental consonant|dentalized]] and negatively-skewed articulations of {{IPA|/s/}} (the aforementioned "gay lisp") are indeed found to be the most powerful perceptual indicators to a listener of a male speaker's sexual orientation,&lt;ref&gt;Mack &amp; Munson, 2011, p. 209-210.&lt;/ref&gt; with experiments revealing that such articulations are perceived as "gayer-sounding" and "younger-sounding".&lt;ref&gt;Mack &amp; Munson, 2011, abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay speech is also widely stereotyped as resembling women's speech.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; However, on the basis of [[phonetics]], [[Benjamin Munson (professor)|Benjamin Munson]] and his colleagues' research has discovered that gay male speech does not simply or categorically imitate female speech.&lt;ref&gt;Munson, B. and Babel, M. (2007), Loose Lips and Silver Tongues, or, Projecting Sexual Orientation Through Speech. Language and Linguistics Compass, 1: 416–449.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one Canadian study, listeners correctly identified gay speakers in 62% of cases.&lt;ref name="toronto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsandevents.utoronto.ca/bin2/020218c.asp |title=Researchers examine patterns in gay speech |last1=Rynor |first1=Micah |date=February 18, 2002 |work=News@UofT |publisher=University of Toronto |accessdate=January 19, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101043238/http://www.newsandevents.utoronto.ca/bin2/020218c.asp |archivedate=November 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Stanford University]] experiment analyzed the acoustics of eight males (four straight and four gay), who were recorded reading passages, through the perception of listener-subjects and tasked these listeners with categorizing speakers by adjectives corresponding to common U.S. stereotypes of gay men.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaudio | first1 = Rudolf P | year = 1994 | title = Sounding Gay: Pitch Properties in the Speech of Gay and Straight Men | url = | journal = American Speech | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 30–57 | doi=10.2307/455948| jstor = 455948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gaudio"&gt;Gaudio, Rudolph (1994) "Sounding Gay: Pitch Properties in the Speech of Gay and Straight Men." ''American Speech'' 69: 30-57.&lt;/ref&gt;  The listeners were generally able to correctly identify the [[sexual orientation]] of the speakers, reflecting the stereotypes. However, there were no [[statistically significant]] differences the listeners identified, if they existed at all, based on intonation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; These findings are representative of other studies as well.&lt;ref name=glbtq&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/gayspeak.html |title=Gayspeak |year=2004 |work=glbtq:  an encyclopedia of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, &amp; queer culture |publisher=glbtq, inc. |accessdate=January 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514003200/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/gayspeak.html |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study,&lt;ref name="pod" /&gt; examined the duration of certain sounds ({{IPA|/æ/}}, {{IPA|/eɪ/}}, and the onset of {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}), [[frequency]] of stressed [[vowel]]s, [[voice-onset time]] of [[voicelessness|voiceless]] [[aspirated consonant]]s, and the release of word-final [[stop consonant]]s. The study found some correlation between these speech traits and sexual orientation, but also clarified the study's narrow scope on only certain phonetic features.&lt;ref name="pod" /&gt;

===Other scholars' views===

[[Language and gender]] scholar [[Robin Lakoff]] not only compares gay male with female speech but also claims that gay men deliberately imitate the latter,&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Lakoff, Robin Tolmach. ''Language and Woman's Place''. New York: Oxford UP, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming this to include an increased use of [[Superlative|superlatives]], inflected [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], and [[Gay lisp|lisping]].&lt;ref name="test2"&gt;Lakoff, Robin Tolmach. ''Language and Woman's Place''. New York: Oxford UP, 2004., additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later linguists have re-evaluated Lakoff's claims and concluded that these characterizations are not consistent for women, instead reflecting stereotypes that may have social meaning and importance but that do not fully capture actual gendered language use.&lt;ref name=queen&gt;Queen, Robin M. "'I Don't Speek Spritch': Locating Lesbian Language". ''Queerly Phrased: Language, Gender, and Sexuality''. Ed. Anna Livia and Kira Hall. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997. 233–256&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguist [[David Crystal]] correlated the use among men of an "effeminate" or "simpering" voice with a widened range of [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[glissando]] effects between stressed syllables, greater use of fall-rise and rise-fall tones, vocal breathiness and huskiness, and occasionally more switching to the [[falsetto]] register.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David. ''English Tone of Voice: Essays in Intonation, Prosody and Paralanguage''. London: Edward Arnold, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, research has not confirmed any unique intonation or pitch qualities of gay speech.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Some such characteristics have been portrayed as mimicking women's speech and judged as derogatory toward or trivializing of women.&lt;ref name=kul&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kulick | first1 = Don | year = 2000 | title = Gay and Lesbian Language | url = | journal = Anthropology Annual Review | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 243–85 | doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.29.1.243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other languages==
A study of over 300 [[Flemish]]-speaking Belgian participants, men and women, found a "significantly higher prevalence" of a "lisp"-like feature in gay men than in other demographics.&lt;ref name="Van Borsel"&gt;Van Borsel, John; and Els De Bruyn, Evelien Lefebvre, Anouschka Sokoloff, Sophia De Ley, Nele Baudonck. "The prevalence of lisping in gay men". ''Journal of Communication Disorders'', Volume 42, Issue 2, 2009, pp. 100-106.&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have also examined and confirmed gay speech characteristics in [[Puerto Rican Spanish]] and other dialects of [[Caribbean Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;Mack, Sara (2011).

The '''Ghomara language''' is a [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]] language spoken in [[Morocco]]. It is the mother tongue of the [[Ghomara people|Ghomara]] [[Berbers]], who total around 10,000 people. Ghomara Berber is spoken on the western edge of the [[Rif]], among the Beni Bu Zra and Beni Mansur tribes of the Ghomara confederacy. Despite being listed as endangered, it is still being passed on to children in these areas.&lt;ref name="The Endangered Langauges Project"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/8469|title=Did you know Ghomara is threatened?|website=Endangered Languages|language=en|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ghomara Berber is relatively similar to [[Senhadja de Srair Berber]] spoken around Ketama. However, it is difficult to understand for a speaker of [[Rifian language|Rifian]].

Some typical features that distinguish the Ghomara variety of Berber from Rifian Berber are the use of the preposition ''dar'' instead of the Rifian ''ghar'', the feminine plural ending ''-an'' instead of ''-in'', and the absence of [[spirantisation]] in word-initial position.

==Current status==
Although elderly Ghomara teach children how to speak Ghomara Berber at home, the language is still considered threatened, with only 10,000 known speakers. A major reason can be attributed to the small geographical location where this language is used, as well as the more common usage of [[Arabic]] throughout Morocco.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
Like Arabic, Ghomara and the other Berber dialects have three vowels: a-, i-, u-.&lt;ref name="J.Hannouche"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=El Hannouche|first=Jamal|title=Ghomara Berber: A Brief Grammatical Survey|date=14 December 2008|degree=Master|publisher=|url=https://www.academia.edu/7963026/GHOMARA_BERBER_A_BRIEF_GRAMMATICAL_SURVEY|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consonants ===
Ghomara has 44 consonants, and most consonants in Ghomara have germinated forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/31685|title=A grammar of Ghomara Berber|last=Khalid|first=Mourigh,|last2=Geesteswetenschappen|first2=Faculteit|website=openaccess.leidenuniv.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
===Nouns===
For [[noun]]s in Ghomara Berber, there are several common trends. The prefix a-, i-, or u- commonly identifies the masculine singular nouns in the language (i.e., ''arg'az'' “man”). For feminine singular nouns, there is both a prefix and a suffix such as ta-…-t (i.e., ''tarbat'' “girl”). This is the most common way to identify feminine singular nouns. Masculine plural nouns are characterized by i-…-en or i-…-an (i.e., ''irg'azen'' “men”). For feminine plural nouns, ti-…-an (i.e., ''tirbatan'' “girls”) is the most common circumfix.&lt;ref name="J.Hannouche"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=El Hannouche|first=Jamal|title=Ghomara Berber: A Brief Grammatical Survey|date=14 December 2008|degree=Master|publisher=|url=https://www.academia.edu/7963026/GHOMARA_BERBER_A_BRIEF_GRAMMATICAL_SURVEY|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pronouns===
Ghomara Berber uses personal, singular, and plural pronouns.

The first person singular pronoun ''nekkin'' is equivalent to "I" in English. The second person singular male pronoun ''kedžin'' and female pronoun ''kemmin'' is equivalent to "you" in English. Similarly, in Ghomara Berber, the third person singular male pronoun ''netta'' and female pronoun ''nettaθa'' is equivalent to him or her in English respectively.

The first person plural pronoun ''nuçna'' is equivalent to "we" in English and the second person plural pronoun ''kunna'' is equivalent to "you all" in English. Lastly, ''niçma'' is the third person plural pronoun equivalent to "they" in English, and is not distinguished by gender.

===Verbs===
In Ghomara Berber verbs contain certain affixes that characterize singularity, plurality, and point of view (POV). The following is an example of the verb conjugations for the English word "to write" or ''ara'' in Ghomara Berber:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
Singular:
*First POV: ara-x
*Second POV: t-ara-t 
*Third Masculine POV: y-ara 
*Third Feminine POV: t-ara
{{col-break}}
Plural:
*First POV: n-ara
*Second POV: t-ara-m
*Third POV: ara-n*
{{col-break}}
{{col-end}}

===Adjectives===
Adjectives have either suffix -ø, which characterizes masculine singular nouns or -θ, which characterizes both feminine singular and all plural nouns. For example:
*Masculine singular: ''tayfur mellulø'' “the, a white table”
*Feminine singular: ''tamγart mezziθ'' “the, a little woman”
*Masculine plural: ''irgazen muqqreθ'' “(the) big men”
*Feminine plural: ''timettutan muqqreθ'' “(the) big women”

==Vocabulary==
An example of common English words in Ghomara Berber:&lt;ref name="J.Hannouche"/&gt;
*''targat'': “dream”
*''ahlan'': “welcome, hello” 
*''hemmam'': “bathroom” 
*''tamuda'': “pig"
*''lmakla'': “food” 
*''tanebdut'': “summer”
*''kama'': “bed” (borrowed from Spanish)

==Numbers==
Ghomara Berber uses a numerical system similar to many other languages. [[Cardinal numbers]] ''yan'' (“one”, masculine) and ''yat'' (“one”, feminine) are the only Berber numerals in Ghomara, while all the other cardinal numbers are borrowed from Moroccan Arabic (''zuž'' (“two”), ''tlata'' (“three”), ''εišrin '' (“twenty”), ''tlatin'' (“thirty”), etc).

'''Guató''' is a possible [[language isolate]] spoken by 1% of the [[Guató people]] of Brazil. Kaufman (1990) provisionally classified it as a branch of the [[Macro-Jê languages]], but no evidence for this was found by Eduardo Ribeiro.

==Phonology==
The Guato vowel system, like that of Macro-Jê languages, collapses a three-way distinction of height in oral vowels to two in nasal vowels.&lt;ref&gt;A. P. Palacios, 1984; A. V. Postigo, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hagahai''', also known as '''Pinai''', is one of two languages of the [[Piawi languages|Piawi family]] of New Guinea. 

Speakers in Enga Province use the name ''Pinai'' for all Pinai-Hagahai speakers. Those in Madang use Hagahai, at least for themselves. Exonyms include ''Wapi'' and ''Miamia'' in [[Enga language|Enga]] and ''Aramo'' in [[Haruai language|Haruai]]. 

Dialects are divergent, but speakers have a common identity.

'''Hermann Friedrich Mögling''' (1811–1881), also spelt '''Herrmann Friedrich Moegling''', was a German missionary from the [[Basel Mission]] who spent most of his career in the western regions of the state of [[Karnataka]], India. He is credited as the publisher of the first ever newspaper in the [[Kannada language]] called as ''[[Mangalooru Samachara]]'' in 1843.&lt;ref name="herr"&gt;Hermann Mögling's contribution to the Kannada literature is mentioned by {{cite web |author=Shrinivas Havanur |url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/Deccanherald/jan182004/artic6.asp |title=Herr Kannada |work=Online Edition of The Deccan Herald 18 January 2004 |publisher=1999 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd. |accessdate=1 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65ERAiQji?url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/Deccanherald/jan182004/artic6.asp |archivedate=5 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a doctorate for his literary work in [[Kannada]] called as ''Bibliotheca Carnataca''.

==Early life==

Hermann Mögling was born in 1811 in the town of [[Brackenheim]] in the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]], Germany.&lt;ref name="birth"&gt;The birth place and lifetime of Hermann Mögling is mentioned by {{cite web|url=http://www.hermann-gundert-gesellschaft.de/esslingen.htm|title=Short biographies of the missionaries honoured with a memorial place in Esslingen|work=Online webpage of Hermann-Gundert Society|publisher=Hermann-Gundert Society|accessdate=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied theology in the [[Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen]] and joined the [[Basel Mission]]. He came to the city of [[Mangalore]] in Karnataka as a missionary of [[Basel Mission]] in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miscellany - Early years of Kannada journalism|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/491818/miscellany-early-years-kannada-journalism.html|accessdate=22 November 2016|publisher=[[Deccan Herald]]|date=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 7 years, in 1843, Mögling had mastered Kannada, and went on to start the first Kannada newspaper - Mangalura Samachara.&lt;ref name=Fernandes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fernandes|first1=Ronald Anil|title=From another time and culture, a proselytiser and Kannada litterateur|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/164832/from-another-time-culture-proselytiser.html|accessdate=7 August 2015|issue=Mangalore|publisher=Deccan Herald|date=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nayak&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nayak|first1=N Dinesh|title=Mogling and his days in Karnataka|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mogling-and-his-days-in-karnataka/article2655231.ece|accessdate=7 August 2015|issue=Dharwad|publisher=The Hindu|date=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Mögling, being a Christian missionary, was involved in missionary related work in [[Mangalore]] but he also learnt the native [[Kannada]] language and contributed significantly to Kannada literature. One of his pioneering works was the publication of the first [[Kannada]] newspaper, ''Mangalooru Samachara'' (meaning ''Mangalore News'').

===Newspaper publishing===
In the days of Mögling's career at [[Mangalore]], there was no simple way of communicating news and other items to the general public because of non-existence of a medium like radio and of a newspaper in the native language. He decided to publish a [[Kannada]] newspaper with the intention of spreading news items to the public. He decided to name it as ''[[Mangaluru Samachara|Mangaluura samaachaara]]'' and its first issue rolled out on 1 July 1843.&lt;ref name="herr" /&gt; Thereafter it was published fortnightly and contained 4 pages. The paper was printed using stone slabs.&lt;ref name="pro"&gt;A history of Kannada newspapers is provided by {{cite web|author=M Ramesh|url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/Deccanherald/jul12005/panorama1646452005630.asp|title=Eventful journey of a vibrant, active Kannada press|work=Online webpage of The Deccan Herald, dated 1 July 2005|publisher=2005, The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the news items covered were local Mangalore-related news, Indian population, news related to the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] and its laws and regulations. Even songs of [[Purandaradasa]] and moral stories were also printed.&lt;ref name="herr" /&gt; There are conflicting reports on whether this newspaper was used by Mögling as a tool for [[proselytisation]] or not.&lt;ref name="herr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pro" /&gt; The newspaper became popular and it was decided to shift its publication to the city of [[Bellary]] where it was renamed as ''Karnataka Samachara''. ''Karnataka Samachara'' was first released on 1 May 1844 and in fact it was the 15th issue of ''[[Mangaluru Samachara|Mangalooru Samachara]]''. ''Karnataka Samachara'' was the first Kannada newspaper to be printed using [[movable type]].&lt;ref name="pro" /&gt; Unfortunately, only three issues of ''Karnataka Samachara'' were released. Mögling is credited to be one of the visionaries for a [[Unification of Karnataka|unified Karnataka]]. In his times, not much communication used to happen between the north and south regions of present-day [[Karnataka]] though the people in these two regions spoke the same language, [[Kannada]]. In the last issue of ''Karnataka Samachara'', he talks of a ''Samagra Karnataka'' (''Unified Karnataka'') which is essentially a union of these different regions.&lt;ref name="herr" /&gt;

===Proselytisation===
Mögling's main job as a missionary of Basel Mission was the spread of Christianity. One of his converts by name Anandaraya Kaundinya and his family have exchanged letters with Mögling which he has published under the title ''Iraaru patragalu'' (Twelve letters). This was the first collection of letters ever published in [[Kannada]].&lt;ref name="herr" /&gt; Even during his stay in [[Kodagu]] district during the years (1853–1858) he spent much of his time on [[proselytisation]]. He also published a German book titled ''Das Kurgland'' which mainly deals with his activities related to Christianity.&lt;ref name="herr" /&gt;

===Literature===
In 1848, Mögling started dealing with [[Kannada]] literature by publishing a list of more than 3000 [[Kannada]] proverbs.&lt;ref name="herr" /&gt; He also composed about 20 poems (along with Weigle who was his cousin brother and a fellow Basel Missionary) in modern Kannada poetical form. This makes him a pioneer of modern Kannada poetry.&lt;ref name="herr" /&gt; But his most important contribution to the [[Kannada]] literature is regarded as the ''Bibliotheca Carnataca'', a six-volume collection of traditional Kannada literary texts, including the songs of [[Basava]]nna, an early [[Lingayatism|Lingayat]] poet;&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt; ''Bibliotheca Carnataca'' as a collection of [[Kannada]] classics was edited and published by him between the period 1848–1853.&lt;ref name="herr" /&gt; Mögling was helped in this venture by a philanthropist, ''J Casamajor'' who was a retired judge from [[Chennai]] and settled in [[Nilgiris district|Nilgiris]].&lt;ref name="herr" /&gt; With an exchange of letters, the two discussed on ways to collect [[Kannada]] manuscripts, select the important ones among them for publishing and identifying skilled people who would be needed to complete this activity. Casamajor agreed to bear all the expenses required for this venture and was very particular that his name should not be mentioned in any of the publications. A total of eight titles were brought out, the first one being the ''Ravana digvijaya – Yakshagana Prasanga'' (the victory of [[Ravana]], based on a scene from [[Yakshagana]]). The largest published title running 760 pages was the [[Basava Purana]] and the smallest one was [[Kanakadasa]]'s ''Haribhaktasara''.&lt;ref name="herr" /&gt; Other titles published as a part of ''Bibliotheca Carnataca'' were ''Dasara Padagalu'' (a collection of 170 [[Haridasa]] songs) and [[Lakshmisha]]'s ''Jaimini Bharata''. This venture met an abrupt end due to the sudden demise of Casamajor and Mögling's return to Germany.

During his stay in [[Kodagu]], Mögling also published the German book ''Das Kurgland'' and also a [[Kannada]] book titled ''Raajendranaame'' at the behest of the [[Kodagu]] king, Senior Virarajendra. The whole book ''Raajendraname'' was printed using a simpler orthographic form invented by Mögling himself.&lt;ref name="herr" /&gt; The [[Kannada]] language uses [[Digraph (orthography)#Double letters|double consonants]] frequently, which Mögling felt was difficult for children to learn easily and also to print (since a blank line between two print lines was necessitated to print the double consonant). Mögling devised a scheme of accommodating the double consonant in the same single line by breaking the double consonant into a half consonant wherever possible. After getting an approval for his scheme from the [[Madras]] Province's Education Department, Mögling published this entire book in his devised orthography.&lt;ref name="herr" /&gt; He also published a book called ''Coorg Memoirs'' which is supposedly one of the earliest history books on [[Karnataka]]. In this book, he has described the social life of [[Kodava people|Kodava]]s and their customs as well.

On his return to Germany, he translated 24 songs of [[Kanakadasa]] and [[Purandaradasa]] to the German language which were published by [[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft]], an [[Oriental]] society in Germany. In 1870, he also translated the first two chapters (67 verses) of ''Bibliotheca Carnataca'''s ''Jaimini Bharata'' into German.

[[Pilgrims Progress]] was published in Kannada by Moegling and Weigle in 1848&lt;ref&gt;Wholeness in Christ: the legacy of the Basel Mission in India G. Shiri, Karnataka Theological Research Institute – 1985 – p358&lt;/ref&gt;

===BEM Theological Seminary===
Hermann Moegling was the founder-principal of the BEM Theological Seminary, established in 1847 by the [[Basel Evangelical Missionary Society]]. This seminary was established to train Pastors for the [[Protestant]] churches in [[Karnataka]] and [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]] areas. In 1965, BEM Theological Seminary was merged with Union Kanarese Seminary at [[Tumkur]] and renamed as present [[Karnataka Theological College]].&lt;ref name="bem"/&gt;

===Mission in Coorg===
In 1852, Rev. Mögling was getting ready to go back to Germany, when he was met by Alamanda Somayya from [[Coorg]], who wanted to convert to Christianity and also invited him to Coorg, offering his land for construction of a church in Coorg. Rev. Mögling cancelled his plans to return to Germany, and instead moved to Coorg along with his junior Rev. Anand Rao Kaundinya in 1853. On 6 January 1853, Alamanda Somayya was baptised into Christianity, taking up the name of Stephanas Somayya. A modest church was built on Somayya's land. The then Chief Commissioner of Coorg,
Lt Col [[Mark Cubbon]], helped Rev. Mögling to set up Coorg's first Protestant church and a school in [[Madikeri|Mercara]] in 1855. Further in 1857, the British administration granted Rev. Mögling 97 acres land to establish a church and a coffee estate settlement.&lt;ref name=Belliappa /&gt;

In spite of his busy schedule in Coorg, Rev. Mögling managed to write two books on Coorg. One in German, called Das Kurgland, detailing evangelical work in Coorg, and the other in English, called Coorg Memoirs, an in depth study of the history of Coorg. Rev. Mögling was very much fond of Coorg and used to call it his second home. He left Coorg in 1860, to be with his ailing wife in Germany.&lt;ref name=Belliappa&gt;{{cite news|last1=Belliappa|first1=C P|title=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/414012/german-kannadigas.html|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/414012/german-kannadigas.html|accessdate=19 January 2015|issue=Bangalore|publisher=Deccan Herald|date=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late years==
When his cousin [[Gottfried Weigle]] died in 1855, Mögling (at a late age of 45) married Weigle's wife Pauline. This marriage also gave Mögling four stepchildren from Pauline's earlier marriage. One last contribution to [[Kannada]] from him was his interest in coming up with a [[Kannada]] – English dictionary. He motivated the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] in this project and also suggested the name of [[Ferdinand Kittel]] as the ideal person to head the project. Mögling died in 1881 and his memorial is in [[Esslingen (district)|Esslingen]].&lt;ref name="birth" /&gt;

==Recognition==
* At the recommendation of [[Rudolph Roth]] (a reputed [[Indologist]]), Mögling's alma mater; the [[Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen]] awarded Mögling an honorary doctorate in 1858 for his work, ''Bibliotheca Carnataca''.
* The Mögling Institute of German Language which is in [[Mangalore]] and affiliated to [[Mangalore University]] is named after him.&lt;ref name="inst"&gt;Silver jubilee celebrations of the Mögling Institute of German Language is mentioned by {{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/09/29/stories/2004092911650300.htm|title=German institute celebrates silver jubilee|work=Online Edition of The Hindu, dated 29 September 2004|publisher=2004, the Hindu|accessdate=1 May 2007|location=Chennai, India|date=29 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1 July (the day when the first issue of ''Mangalooru Samachara'' was released) is celebrated as ''Kannada Press Day'' in [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref name="day"&gt;Kannada press day events are mentioned by {{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/Jul32006/state195126200672.asp|title=It was all video and less audio|work=The Deccan Herald|date= 3 July 2006|publisher=2005, The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd|accessdate=1 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720160309/http://deccanherald.com/deccanherald/jul32006/state195126200672.asp |archivedate=2006-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''human microphone''', also known as the '''people's microphone''', is a means for delivering a speech to a large group of people, wherein persons gathered around the speaker repeat what the speaker says, thus "amplifying" the voice of the speaker without the need for amplification equipment.

The speaker begins by saying "mic check". When the people near the speaker respond "mic check", the speaker knows they have the group's attention. The speaker says a short phrase, part of a speech, and then pauses. Those that can hear what the speaker has said repeat the phrase in unison, and when finished, the speaker says another phrase, then pauses again waiting for a response, etc., until the speaker's speech is complete.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

If the entire gathering still cannot hear the speaker, organizers ask for additional repetitions by those at the limit of [[wikt:earshot|earshot]]. For large gatherings, this may require two or three waves of repetition.

This method of communication attracted attention due to its use by [[Occupy Wall Street]]. It was deployed at large [[General assembly (Occupy movement)|general assemblies]] to help ensure everyone could hear announcements, because New York had regulations prohibiting the use of conventional [[megaphone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Richard (October 3, 2011).

Critics of the way ''Occupy'' protestors use mic-checking, including Karl Rove, have suggested it does not respect the principle of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] and others have criticised it for producing the illusion of group consensus amongst those acting as the "amplifiers". 

Sympathisers have argued the practice highlights the existence of considerable inequality in power of expression that exists between the [[We are the 99%|one percent]] and much of the rest of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''In-band on-channel''' ('''IBOC''') is a hybrid method of transmitting [[digital radio]] and analog radio [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]s [[simulcast|simultaneously]] on the same [[frequency]].

By utilizing additional digital [[subcarrier]]s or [[sideband]]s, [[Digital data|digital]] information is "[[Multiplexing|multiplexed]]" on an [[amplitude modulation|AM]] or [[frequency modulation|FM]] analog signal, thus avoiding [[frequency allocation|re-allocation]] of the broadcast bands.  However, by putting [[radio frequency|RF]] energy outside of the [[spectral mask|normally-defined]] [[Communication channel|channel]], [[Adjacent-channel interference|interference]] to [[adjacent channel]] stations is increased when using digital sidebands.  The addition of the digital sidebands works better in the United States, where the FM broadcast band channels have a spacing of 200&amp;nbsp;kHz, as opposed to the 100&amp;nbsp;kHz that is normal elsewhere.  The 200&amp;nbsp;kHz spacing means that in practice, stations having concurrent or adjacent coverage areas will not be spaced at less than 400&amp;nbsp;kHz.  Outside of the US, spacing can be 300&amp;nbsp;kHz, which causes problems with the IBOC digital sidebands.

IBOC does allow for multiple program channels, though this can entail taking some existing subcarriers off the air to make additional [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] available in the modulation [[baseband]]. On FM, this could eventually mean removing [[stereophonic sound|stereo]]. On AM, IBOC is [[wikt:incompatible|incompatible]] with analog stereo, and any additional channels are limited to highly compressed voice, such as [[traffic]] and [[weather]]. Eventually, stations can go from [[HD Radio|hybrid]] mode (both analog and digital) to all-digital, by eliminating the baseband [[Monaural|monophonic]] audio.

==FM methods==
On FM there are currently three methods of IBOC broadcasting in use, mainly in the [[United States]].

===HD Radio Broadcasting===
The first, and currently only, digital technology approved for use on AM and FM broadcast frequencies by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in the United States, is the proprietary [[HD Radio]] system developed by [[iBiquity]] Digital Corporation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/digital.html |title=FCC digital radio broadcasting |work=United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division }}&lt;/ref&gt; which transmits energy beyond the allotted ±100&amp;nbsp;kHz FM channel.  This creates potential interference issues with adjacent channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrscstandards.org/SG.asp |title=NRSC 5B of April 2010 |work=[[National Radio Systems Committee]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the most widespread system in use, with approximately 1,556 stations transmitting HD radio in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/sta_list.pl?Service=FM&amp;digital_status=H |title=FCC digital radio broadcasting FM stations list |work=United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division }}&lt;/ref&gt; plus over 800 new multicast channels (as of Jan 2010). There is a one-time license fee to iBiquity Digital, for the use of its intellectual property, as well as costs for new equipment which range from $50,000 to $100,000 US (2010) per station.

===FMeXtra===
The other system is [[FMeXtra]] by Digital Radio Express, which instead uses subcarriers within the existing signal.  This system was introduced more recently.  The system is compatible with HD Radio in hybrid mode, but not in all-digital mode, and with [[RBDS]].  The stereo subcarrier can be removed to make more space available for FMeXtra in the modulation baseband.  However, the system is not compatible with other existing 67–92&amp;nbsp;kHz subcarriers which have mostly fallen into disuse.  The system is far less expensive and less complicated to implement, needing only to be plugged into the existing [[Transmitter#Power output|exciter]], and requiring no licensing fees.  FMeXtra has generally all the user features of HD Radio, including multicast capability; the ability to broadcast several different audio programs simultaneously. It uses the aacPlus (HE-AAC) codec.

FMeXtra can control listening with [[conditional access]] and [[encryption]].

===DRM===
[[Digital Radio Mondiale]] allows for simultaneous transmission of multiple data streams alongside an audio signal. The DRM mode for VHF provides bandwidths from between 35 kbit/s to 185 kbit/s and up to four simultaneous data streams, allowing  5.1 surround DVD quality audio to be broadcast alongside other multimedia content - images, video or HTML content are typical examples.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.owdjim.gen.nz/chris/radio/DRM/&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is not backwardly compatible with existing FM receiver equipment, with broadcasts digitally encoded using HE-AAC or [[xHE-AAC]], this ability to operate within the internationally agreed FM spectrum of 88-108&amp;nbsp;MHz makes DRM a viable candidate for future adoption when countries begin to switch off their analogue broadcasts.

==AM methods==

===HD Radio Broadcasting===
iBiquity also created a [[mediumwave]] HD Radio system for AM, which is the only system approved by the Federal Communications Commission for digital AM broadcasting in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/digital.html |title=FCC digital radio broadcasting |work=United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The HD Radio system employs use of injected digital sidebands above and below the audible portion of the analog audio on the primary carrier.  This system also phase modulates the carrier in [[quadrature phase|quadrature]] and injects more digital information on this phase-modulated portion of the carrier.  It is based on the principle of [[AM stereo]] where it puts a digital signal where the [[C-QUAM]] system would put the analog stereo decoding information.

===DRM===
Digital Radio Mondiale has had much more success {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} in creating an AM system, and one that could be much less expensive to implement than any [[Proprietary protocol|proprietary]] HD Radio system, although it requires new frequency.  It is the only one to have been accepted mediumwave but also [[shortwave]] (and possibly [[longwave]]) by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) for use in regions I and III, but not yet in region II, the [[Americas]].  The HD Radio system has also been approved by International Telecommunication Union.

===CAM-D===
[[CAM-D]] is yet another method, though it is more of an extension of the current system.  Developed by AM stereo pioneer [[Leonard R. Kahn]], It encodes the [[Clef#Treble clef|treble]] on very small digital sidebands which do not cause interference to adjacent channels, and mixes it back with the analog baseband.  Unlike the other two, it is not intended to be capable of multichannel, opting for quality over quantity.  Unlike the HD system iBiquity calls "hybrid digital" the CAM-D system truly is a direct hybrid of both analog and digital.  Some engineers believe that CAM-D may be compatible with analog AM stereo with the right engineering.

Critics of CAM-D point to several drawbacks:
#being primarily analog, the system will be just as subject to artificial interference and noise as the current AM system
#there are virtually no receivers available for the system and at present, no major manufacturer has announced even the intention to begin production of them; and
#the cost of retrofitting with CAM-D is more than that of simply buying a new, HD-ready solid state transmitter.

== IBOC Versus DAB ==

While the United Kingdom has chosen the Eureka 147 standard of digital audio broadcasting (DAB) for creating a digital radio service, the United States has selected IBOC technology for its digital AM and FM stations.  The band used for terrestrial DAB in the UK is part of VHF band III, which does not suffer from L-band's significant line-of-sight problems. However, it is not available in North America since that span is occupied by TV channels 7 to 13 and the amateur radio 1.25 meter (222&amp;nbsp;MHz) band. The stations currently occupying that spectrum did not wish to give up their space, since VHF offers several benefits over UHF: relatively lower power, long distance propagation (up to 100 miles (160&amp;nbsp;km) with a rooftop antenna), and a longer wavelength that is more robust and less affected by interference. In Canada, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) is continuing to follow the analog standard, so the channels remain unavailable there as well. HD Radio testing has been authorized in Canada, as well as other countries around the world.

There was also concern that AM and FM stations' branding, using their current frequencies, would be lost to new channel numbers, though virtual channels such as on digital television would eliminate this. Also, several competing stations would have to share a transmitter that multiplexes them all into one ensemble with the same coverage area (though many FM stations are already diplexed in large cities such as New York). [https://web.archive.org/web/20110725192711/http://www.esbnyc.com/tourism/tourism_facts_broadcasting.cfm] A further concern to FM station operators was that AM stations could suddenly be in competition with the same high audio quality, although FM would still have the advantage of higher data rates (300 kbit/s versus 60 kbit/s in the HD Radio standard) due to greater bandwidth (100&amp;nbsp;kHz versus 10&amp;nbsp;kHz).

The most significant advantage for IBOC is its relative ease of implementation. Existing analog radios are not rendered obsolete and the consumer and industry may transition to digital at a rational pace. In addition, the technology infrastructure is in place: most major broadcast equipment manufacturers are implementing IBOC technology and 60+ receiver manufacturers are selling IBOC reception devices.  In the UK, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland, which are the leading countries with regard to implementing DAB, the first-generation [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II]] (MP2) codec stereo radio stations on DAB have a lower sound-quality than FM, prompting a number of complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wo.uio.no/as/WebObjects/theses.woa/wa/these?WORKID=52348 |last=Holm |first=Steve |publisher=Digitale Utgivelser ved UiO |title=Lydkvalitetet i DAB digitalradio |year=2007 |accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501073857/http://wo.uio.no/as/WebObjects/theses.woa/wa/these?WORKID=52348 |archivedate=2008-05-01 |df= }} ([[Nynorsk|Norwegian]])&lt;/ref&gt; The typical bandwidth for DAB programs is only 128 kbit/s using the first generation CODEC, the less-robust MP2 standard which requires at least ''double'' that rate to be considered near-CD quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.david.robinson.org/commsbill/#1_2_3 |work=OFCOM: Regulation in digital broadcasting: DAB digital radio bitrates and audio quality; Dynamic range compression and loudness |title=DAB sound quality |last=Robinson |first=David J. M. |date=2002-07-09 |accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708211612/http://www.david.robinson.org/commsbill#1_2_3 |archivedate=2008-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.ebu.ch/CMSimages/en/tec_doc_t3296_tcm6-10497.pdf |format=PDF|title=EBU subjective listening tests on low-bitrate audio codecs |publisher=EBU * UER |last=Kozamernik |first=Franc |date=June 2003 |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new version of the Eureka-147 standard called DAB+ has been implemented. Using the more efficient high quality MPEG-4 CODEC called HE-AAC v2, this compression method will allow the DAB+ system to carry more channels or have better sound quality at the same bit rate as the old DAB system.  It is the new DAB+ implementation which will be under consideration for new station designs and not the earlier DAB scheme using the MUSICAM CODEC. This new DAB+ system was coordinated and developed by the World DAB Forum, formed in 1997 from the old organization. It will give the Eureka-147 system a similar quality per bit rate as the IBOC system and hence a better sound quality than FM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.worlddab.org/introduction_to_digital_broadcasting/dab_plus_digital_radio |title=DAB+ - Upgrade to DAB Digital Radio - The World DAB Forum |access-date=2009-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015132028/http://www.worlddab.org/introduction_to_digital_broadcasting/dab_plus_digital_radio |archive-date=2009-10-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
AM IBOC in the United States still faces some serious technological challenges of its own, including nighttime interference with other stations. iBiquity was previously using PAC (also used at a higher bitrate in Sirius satellite radio, see [[Digital Audio Radio Service]]), but in August 2003 a switch to HDC (based-upon ACC) was made to rectify these problems. HDC has been customized for IBOC, and it is also likely that the patent rights and royalties for every transmitter and receiver can be retained longer by creating a more proprietary system. Digital Radio Mondiale is also developing an IBOC system, likely to be used worldwide with AM shortwave radio, and possibly with broadcast AM and FM. Neither of those have been approved yet for ITU region 2 (the Americas). The system, however, unlike HD Radio, does not permit the existing analog signal and the digital signal to live together in the same channel. DRM requires an additional channel to maintain both signals.

Both AM and FM IBOC signals cause interference to adjacent-channel stations, but not within the station’s interference-free protected contours designated by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). It has led to derogatory terms such as IBAC (In-band adjacent-channel) and IBUZ (since the interference sounds like a buzz.) The range of a station on an HD Radio receiver is somewhat less than its analog signal. However, in June, 2008, a group of US broadcasters and equipment manufacturers requested that the U.S. FCC increase the permissible FM IBOC power from 1% (currently) to a maximum of 10% of the analog power. On January 29, 2010, the FCC approved the request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/audio/DA-10-208A1.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140523212426/http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/audio/DA-10-208A1.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-05-23 |author=FCC |title=Digital power increase for FM stations approved. MM Docket No. 99-235, DA 10-208. |date=2010-01-29 |accessdate=2010-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, tropospheric ducting and e-skip can reduce the range of the digital signal, as well as the analog.

In-band on-channel digital radios using iBiquity's standard are being marketed under the brand "HD Radio" to highlight the purported quality of reception. As of June 2008, over 60 different receiver models have been made, and stations have received blanket (no longer individual and experimental) authorization from the U.S. FCC to transmit in a multiplexed multichannel mode on FM. Originally, the use of HD Radio transmission on AM was limited to daytime only, and not allowed at night due to potential problems with skywave radio propagation.  The FCC lifted this restriction in early 2007. DRM, however, is being used across Europe on shortwave, which is entirely AM skywave, without issue. With the proper receiver, many of those stations can be heard in North America as well, sans the analog signal.

==IBOC around the world==

=== Argentina ===
HD Radio technology was tested in 2004 with initial trials in Buenos Aires. Further testing of the technology began in early 2007.

=== Bangladesh ===
Government broadcaster BETAR began broadcasting HD Radio on their 100.0&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency on 9 November 2016 from their Agargaon site in Dhaka.  The transmission uses a 10&amp;nbsp;kW GatesAir system.  The 100.0&amp;nbsp;MHz carries programs from [[BBC World Service]] amongst others.  HD 1, 2, 3 and 4 are configured.  A second transmission will also have HD radio added on 88.8&amp;nbsp;MHz from the same site.

=== Bosnia ===
Trial and tests of HD Radio technology began in Sarajevo in March 2007.

===  Brazil ===
HD Radio and DRM trials in Brazil started in the mid 2000s. No regular HD Radio or DRM transmissions are allowed in Brazil as the digital radio standard in that country is not yet defined. One or two year experimental licenses were given to some Broadcasters. A joint study by the government (Ministry of Communications and ANATEL) and the National Metrology Institute (Inmetro) was done&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comunicacoes.gov.br/testes-com-medicoes |author=Ministério das Comunicações |title=Relatórios de testes com medições. |date=2012-08-08 |accessdate=2015-06-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623201944/http://www.comunicacoes.gov.br/testes-com-medicoes |archive-date=2015-06-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Digital Radio Consultative Council concluded that HD Radio and DRM do not meet the same analog transmission coverage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebc.com.br/noticias/brasil/2013/10/testes-feitos-com-radio-digital-apresentam-alcance-inferior-ao-analogico-diz |author=Empresa Brasil de Comunicação (Brazilian Public Broadcaster) |title=Testes feitos com rádio digital apresentam alcance inferior ao analógico, diz ministério. |date=2013-10-08 |accessdate=2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 20db less power. New trials are expected to occur before any decision about the Brazilian Digital Radio standard. Brazil is considering for adoption Digital Radio Mondiale or HD Radio.

=== Canada ===
After having [[L-band]] DAB for several years, the [[Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) and [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) have also looked at the use of HD Radio, given its gradual progress in the neighbouring U.S. The CBC began HD Radio testing in September 2006, focusing on transmissions from [[Toronto]] and [[Peterborough, Ontario]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The CRTC has since revised its policy on digital radio to allow HD Radio operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2006/pb2006-160.htm Public Notice CRTC 2006-160]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Czech Republic ===
Initial testing of the HD Radio system commenced in Prague in February 2007.

=== China ===
In China, Hunan Broadcasting Company started FMeXtra transmissions in Changsha in April 2007, and plans to put others throughout the Hunan province. SARFT (State Administration for Radio, Film and Television) is currently testing HD Radio in Beijing in contemplation for acceptance in that country.

=== Colombia ===
Caracol Radio began testing of the HD Radio technology in both the AM and FM bands in early 2008.

=== El Salvador ===
El Salvador will be choosing HD Radio as its digital radio standard.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

=== Europe ===
In September 2007 the European HD Radio Alliance (EHDRA) was formed by broadcasters and other interested groups to promote the adoption of HD Radio technology by European broadcasters, regulators and standards organizations.

=== France ===
France began broadcasting an HD Radio signal in March 2006 and plans to multicast two or more channels. The radio stations that use IBOC HD in France are SIRTI and NRJ Group. The owner of the transmitter is Towercast. The frequency of IBOC HD radio is 88.2&amp;nbsp;MHz. In May 2006, The Towercast group added a single channel of digital audio on 93.9&amp;nbsp;MHz.

=== Germany ===
Radio Regenbogen began HD Radio operations on 102.8&amp;nbsp;MHz in Heidelberg on December 3, 2007 pursuant to government testing authority.

=== Indonesia ===
Forum Radio Jaringan Indonesia had tested IBOC HD transmission from March 2006 to May 2006. The IBOC HD station in Jakarta was Delta FM (99.1&amp;nbsp;MHz). In April 2006, Radio Sangkakala (in Surabaya), the first AM HD radio station in Asia, went on the air on 1062&amp;nbsp;kHz.

=== Jamaica ===
Radio Jamaica began operating full-time with both HD Radio AM and FM signals in the city of Kingston in 2008.

=== Mexico ===
All Mexican radio stations [[Border blaster|within 320 km of the U.S. border]] are allowed to transmit their programs on the AM and FM bands utilizing HD Radio technology.  Approximately six Mexican AM and FM stations are already operating with HD Radio technology along Mexico’s border area with the US.  Grupo Imagen commenced HD Radio transmissions on XHDL-FM and XEDA-FM as well as Instituto Mexicano de la Radio on XHIMR-FM, XHIMER-FM and XHOF-FM in Mexico City in June 2012.

=== New Zealand ===
HD Radio transmission in Auckland, New Zealand was started on October 19, 2005. The frequency of IBOC HD radio is 106.1&amp;nbsp;MHz. The transmitter is located at Skytower.  Following successful testing, the Radio Broadcasters Association (RBA) initiated a comprehensive trial of HD Radio technology in December 2006. The aim of the trial was to assess the coverage potential of the HD Radio system and to make a recommendation on the suitability of the technology for adoption.

=== Philippines ===
The first HD Radio station in the Philippines began broadcasting on November 9, 2005. The Philippines National Telecommunications Commission finalized its rules for FM digital radio operations on November 11, 2007.

=== Poland ===
An HD Radio trial began in Warsaw in 2006 in order to demonstrate the technology to local radio stations.

=== Puerto Rico ===
WPRM FM is the first station in San Juan, Puerto Rico (part of the US) to adopt HD Radio, in April 2005.  WRTU in San Juan has also commenced broadcasting in HD Radio technology in 2007.

=== Switzerland ===
FM testing sponsored by Radio Sunshine and Ruoss AG began in Lucerne in April 2006. HD Radio operations in Switzerland continue and are spotlighted each year during “HD Radio Days”, an annual gathering in Lucerne of European broadcasters and manufacturers for the purpose of discussing the rollout of the technology in Europe.

Radio Sunshine has now switched to DAB+ &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunshine.ch/dynasite.cfm?dsmid=98472&lt;/ref&gt;
due to the high penetration of DAB+ and lack of interest in HD Radio.
DAB+ penetration in Switzerland has now reached 99.5% as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.worlddab.org/country_information_/switzerland |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808131645/http://www.worlddab.org/country_information_/switzerland |archive-date=2013-08-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thailand ===

HD Radio transmission in Thailand was started in April 2006. Radio of Thailand had created a public IBOC HD radio network targeting mass transit commuters in Thailand's capital of Bangkok. To receive the broadcasts, more than 10,000 HD Radio receivers were installed in buses.

=== Ukraine ===

The first FM HD Radio broadcasts in Kiev went on the air in October 2006 on two FM stations operated by the First Ukrainian Radio Group.

=== Vietnam ===

Voice of Vietnam (VOV) commenced AM and FM HD Radio transmissions in Hanoi in June, 2008 including multicasting, in anticipation of making HD Radio technology a standard.

=== United States ===
As of June 2008, more than 1,700 HD Radio stations were broadcasting 2,432 HD Radio channels. HD Radio technology is the only digital technology approved by the FCC for digital AM and FM broadcasting in the US.  Over 60 different HD Radio receivers are on sale in over 12,000 stores nationwide, including Apple, Best Buy, Target, and Wal-Mart.

As of May 2007, FMeXtra is on several dozen stations.  Several hundred stations belonging to the [[Idea Bank]] [[consortium]] will also have FMeXtra installed. [http://www.dreinc.com/company/pr/4_14_06.html]

'''Indeterminacy''', in [[philosophy]], can refer both to common scientific and mathematical concepts of [[uncertainty]] and their implications and to another kind of indeterminacy deriving from the nature of [[definition]] or meaning. It is related to [[deconstructionism]] and to [[Nietzsche]]'s criticism of the Kantian [[noumenon]].

==Indeterminacy in philosophy==
===Introduction===

The problem of indeterminacy arises when one observes the eventual circularity of virtually every possible definition. It is easy to find loops of definition in any dictionary, because this seems to be the only way that certain concepts, and generally very important ones such as that of [[existence]], can be defined in the English language. A definition is a collection of other words, and in any finite dictionary if one continues to follow the trail of words in search of the precise meaning of any given term, one will inevitably encounter this linguistic indeterminacy.

Philosophers and scientists generally try to eliminate indeterminate terms from their arguments, since any indeterminate thing is unquantifiable and untestable; similarly, any hypothesis which consists of a statement of the properties of something unquantifiable or indefinable cannot be falsified and thus cannot be said to be supported by evidence that does not falsify it. This is related to [[Karl Popper|Popper]]'s discussions of falsifiability in his works on the [[scientific method]]. The [[quantifiability]] of data collected during an experiment is central to the scientific method, since reliable conclusions can only be drawn from replicable experiments, and since in order to establish observer agreement scientists must be able to quantify experimental evidence.

===Kant and hazards of positing the "thing in itself"===

[[Immanuel Kant]] unwittingly proposed one answer to this question in his [[Critique of Pure Reason]] by stating that there must "exist" a "[[thing in itself]]"&amp;nbsp;– a thing which is the cause of phenomena, but not a [[phenomenon]] itself. But, so to speak, "approximations" of "things in themselves" crop up in many models of empirical phenomena. Singularities in physics, such as [[gravitational singularities]], ''certain aspects of which'' (e.g., their unquantifiability){{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} can seem ''almost'' to mirror various "aspects" of the proposed "thing in itself", are generally eliminated (or attempts are made at eliminating them) in newer, more precise models of the universe. Definitions of various [[psychiatric disorders]] stem, according to philosophers who draw on the work of [[Michel Foucault]], from a belief that something unobservable and indescribable is fundamentally "wrong" with the mind of whoever suffers from such a disorder. Proponents of Foucault's treatment of the concept of insanity would assert that one need only try to quantify various characteristics of such disorders as presented in today's [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] (e.g., [[delusion]], one of the diagnostic criteria which must be exhibited by a patient if he or she is to be considered [[schizophrenic]]) in order to discover that the field of study known as [[abnormal psychology]] relies upon indeterminate concepts in defining virtually each "mental disorder" it describes. The quality that makes a belief a delusion is indeterminate to the extent to which it is unquantifiable; arguments that delusion is determined by popular sentiment (i.e., "almost no-one believes that he or she is made of cheese, and thus that belief is a delusion") would lead to the conclusion that, for example, [[Alfred Wegener|Alfred Wegener's]] assertion of [[continental drift]] was a delusion since it was dismissed for decades after it was made.

===Nietzsche and the indeterminacy of the "thing in itself"===

{{See also|Nietzsche and free will|Eternal return}}
Relevant criticism of Kant's original formulation of the "thing in itself" can be found in the works of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche]], who argued against what he held to be the indeterminate nature of such concepts as the Platonic idea, the subject, the Kantian noumenon, the opposition of "appearance" to "reality", etc. Nietzsche concisely argued against Kant's [[noumenon]] in his ''On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense'' as follows:

: "The 'thing in itself' (which is precisely what the pure truth, apart from any of its consequences, would be) is likewise something quite incomprehensible to the creator of language and something not in the least worth striving for."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicappeal.org/library/nietzsche/Nietzsche_various/on_truth_and_lies.htm Nietzsche, F., ''On Truth and Lies'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Beyond Good and Evil'', Nietzsche argues against the "misleading significance of words" and its production of a "thing in itself":

: "I would repeat it, however, a hundred times, that 'immediate certainty,' as well as 'absolute knowledge' and the 'thing in itself,' involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves from the misleading significance of words!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/nietzsche/1886/beyond-good-evil/ch01.htm Nietzsche, F. ''Beyond Good and Evil'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Nietzsche argued against such singularities as the atom in the scientific models of his day in ''The Will to Power'':

: "For all its detachment and freedom from emotion, our science is still the dupe of linguistic habits; it has never got rid of those changelings called 'subjects.' The atom is one such changeling, another is the Kantian 'thing-in-itself.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wutsamada.com/alma/modern/nietzquo.htm Nietzsche quotes]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approximation versus equality===

The concept of something that is unapproachable but always further-approximable has led to a rejection by philosophers like [[Nietzsche]] of the concept of exact equality in general in favor of that of approximate similarity:

: "Every word instantly becomes a concept precisely insofar as it is not supposed to serve as a reminder of the unique and entirely individual original experience to which it owes its origin; but rather, a word becomes a concept insofar as it simultaneously has to fit countless more or less similar cases&amp;nbsp;– which means, purely and simply, cases which are never equal and thus altogether unequal."&lt;ref name="Nietzsche quote"&gt;[[q:Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche quote]]&lt;/ref&gt;

: "What then is truth? A movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and; anthropomorphisms: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished, and which, after long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding. Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions- they are metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force, coins which have lost their embossing and are now considered as metal and no longer as coins."&lt;ref name="Nietzsche quote"/&gt;

If one states an equation between two things, one states, in effect, that they are the same thing. It can be argued that this cannot possibly be true, since one will then consider the properties which the two sides of the equation share&amp;nbsp;– that which makes them "equal"&amp;nbsp;– but one also can, and does, consider them as two separate concepts. Even in a mathematical statement as simple as "x=x", one encounters fundamental differences between the two "x"es under consideration: firstly, that there are two distinct "x"es, in that they neither occupy the same space on this page nor in one's own mind. There would otherwise be only one "x". Secondly, that if two things were absolutely equal in every possible respect, then there would necessarily be no reason to consider their equality. Nothing could lead anyone to consider the possibility or impossibility of their equality if there were no properties ''not'' shared between "them", since there would necessarily be no relationship between them whatsoever. Thirdly, and most importantly, if two things were equal in every possible respect they would necessarily not be two things, but the very same thing, since there would be no difference to separate them.

In examples as odd as this, the differences between two approximately equal things may be very small indeed, and it is certainly true that they are quite irrelevant to most discussions. Acceptance of the reflexive property illustrated above has led to useful mathematical discoveries which have influenced the life of anyone reading this article on a computer. But in an examination of the possibility of the determinacy of any possible concept, differences like this are supremely relevant since that quality which could possibly make two separate things "equal" seems to be indeterminate.

===The indeterminacy of the ''pharmakon'' in Derrida's [[Plato's Pharmacy]]===

{{main article|Pharmakon_(philosophy)|l1=Pharmakon (philosophy)}}

Indeterminacy was discussed in one of [[Jacques Derrida|Jacques Derrida's]] early works ''[[Plato's Pharmacy]]'' (1969),&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.chass.ncsu.edu/wyrick/debclass/pharma.htm Derrida, ''Plato's Pharmacy'' in ''Dissemination'', 1972, Athlone Press, London, 1981] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010200631/http://social.chass.ncsu.edu/wyrick/debclass/pharma.htm |date=2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a reading of [[Plato]]'s ''Phaedrus'' and ''Phaedo''.  Plato writes of a fictionalized conversation between [[Socrates]] and a student, in which Socrates tries to convince the student that writing is inferior to speech.&lt;ref&gt;''Phaedrus'' 275c&lt;/ref&gt;  Socrates uses the Egyptian myth of Thoth's creation of writing to illustrate his point.  As the story goes, Thoth presents his invention to the god-king of Upper Egypt for judgment.  Upon its presentation, Thoth offers script as a ''pharmakon'' for the Egyptian people.  The Greek word [[Pharmakon (philosophy)|pharmakon]] poses a quandary for translators: it is both a remedy and a poison.  In the proffering of a pharmakon, Thoth presents it as its true meaning: a harm and benefit.  The god-king, however, refuses the invention. Through various reasonings, he determines the pharmakon of writing to be a bad thing for the Egyptian people.  The pharmakon, the undecidable, has been returned decided.  The problem, as Derrida reasons, is this: since the word pharmakon, in the original Greek, means both a remedy and a poison, it cannot be determined as fully remedy or fully poison. Amon rejected writing as fully poison in Socrates' retelling of the tale, thus shutting out the other possibilities.

===Foucault and the indeterminacy of insanity===

The philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] wrote about the existence of such problems of precise definition in the very concept of [[insanity]] itself&amp;nbsp;– a ''very'' rough approximation of his argument can be found in the late social commentator and journalist [[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s book, ''[[Kingdom of Fear (book)|Kingdom of Fear]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The only difference between the Sane and the Insane, is IN and yet within this world, the Sane have the power to have the Insane locked up."&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Hunter S. Thompson|H. S. Thompson quote]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another summary of Foucault's original argument against the indeterminacy of the concept of insanity in his ''Madness and Civilization'' can be found in the following excerpt from the ''Literature, Arts, and Medicine Database'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Central to this is the notion of confinement as a meaningful exercise. Foucault's history explains how the mad came first to be confined; how they became identified as confined due to moral and economic factors that determined those who ought to be confined; how they became perceived as dangerous through their confinement, partly by way of atavistic identification with the lepers whose place they had come to occupy; how they were 'liberated' by Pinel and Tuke, but in their liberation remained confined, both physically in asylums and in the designation of being mad; and how this confinement subsequently became enacted in the figure of the psychiatrist, whose practice is 'a certain moral tactic contemporary with the end of the eighteenth century, preserved in the rites of the asylum life, and overlaid by the myths of positivism.' Science and medicine, notably, come in at the later stages, as practices 'elaborated once this division' between the mad and the sane has been made (ix)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mchip00.nyu.edu/lit-med/lit-med-db/webdocs/webdescrips/foucault12432-des-.html Foucault, M. ''Madness and Civilisation''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907234548/http://mchip00.nyu.edu/lit-med/lit-med-db/webdocs/webdescrips/foucault12432-des-.html |date=2006-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''The Archaeology of Knowledge'', Foucault addresses indeterminacy directly by discussing the origin of the meaning of concepts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Foucault directs his analysis toward the 'statement', the basic unit of discourse that he believes has been ignored up to this point. 'Statement' is the English translation from French énoncé (that which is enunciated or expressed), which has a peculiar meaning for Foucault. 'Énoncé' for Foucault means that which makes propositions, utterances, or speech acts meaningful. In this understanding, statements themselves are not propositions, utterances, or speech acts. Rather, statements create a network of rules establishing what is meaningful, and it is these rules that are the preconditions for propositions, utterances, or speech acts to have meaning. Statements are also 'events'. Depending on whether or not they comply with the rules of meaning, a grammatically correct sentence may still lack meaning and inversely, an incorrect sentence may still be meaningful. Statements depend on the conditions in which they emerge and exist within a field of discourse. It is huge collections of statements, called discursive formations, toward which Foucault aims his analysis.
[...]
Rather than looking for a deeper meaning underneath discourse or looking for the source of meaning in some transcendental subject, Foucault analyzes the conditions of existence for meaning. In order to show the principles of meaning production in various discursive formations he details how truth claims emerge during various epochs on the basis of what was actually said and written during these periods of time."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Foucault#The_Archaeology_of_Knowledge|Foucault, M. ''The Archaeology of Knowledge'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The difference described by Foucault between the sane and the insane does have observable and very real effects on millions of people daily and can be characterized in terms of those effects, but it can also serve to illustrate a particular effect of the indeterminacy of definition: i.e., that insofar as the general public tends not to characterize or define insanity in very precise terms, it tends, according to Foucault, unnecessarily and arbitrarily to confine some of its members on an irrational basis. The less-precisely such states as "insanity" and "criminality" are defined in a society, the more likely that society is to fail to continue over time to describe the same behaviors as characteristic of those states (or, alternately, to characterize such states in terms of the same behaviors).

===Indeterminacy in discourse analysis===

Steve Hoenisch asserts in his article ''Interpretation and Indeterminacy in [[Discourse Analysis]]'' that "[T]he exact meaning of a speaker's utterance in a contextualized exchange is often indeterminate. Within the context of the analysis of the teacher-pupil exchange, I will argue for the superiority of interactional linguistics over speech act theory because it reduces the indeterminacy and yields a more principled interpretation[...]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criticism.com/da/da_indet.htm Hoenisch, S. ''Interpretation and Indeterminacy in Discourse Analysis'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indeterminacy and consciousness===

[[Richard Dawkins]], the man who coined the term [[meme]] in the 1970s, described the concept of faith in his documentary, ''Root of All Evil?'', as "the process of non-thinking". In the documentary, he used [[Bertrand Russell]]'s analogy between a teapot orbiting the sun (something that cannot be observed because the brightness of the sun would obscure it even from the best telescope's view) and the object of one's faith (in this particular case, God) to explain that a highly indeterminate idea can self-replicate freely: "Everybody in the society had faith in the teapot. Stories of the teapot had been handed down for generations as part of the tradition of society. There are holy books about the teapot."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Articles/1999-10-04snakeoil.shtml Dawkins ''World of Dawkins''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505103001/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Articles/1999-10-04snakeoil.shtml |date=2008-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues against the existence of determinate meaning (in this case, of the subjective experience of vision for frogs) via an explanation of their indeterminacy in the chapter entitled ''The Evolution of Meanings'', in the section ''The Quest for Real Meanings'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Unless there were 'meaningless' or 'indeterminate' variation in the triggering conditions of the various frogs' eyes, there could be no raw material [...] for selection for a ''new'' purpose to act upon. The indeterminacy that Fodor (and others) see as a flaw [...] is actually a prediction for such evolution [of "purpose"]. The idea that there must be ''something determinate'' that the frog's eye really means&amp;nbsp;– some possibly unknowable proposition in froggish that expresses ''exactly'' what the frog's eye is telling the frog's brain&amp;nbsp;– is just [[essentialism]] applied to meaning (or function). Meaning, like function on which it so directly depends, is not something determinate at its birth. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dennet argues, controversially,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lormand/phil/cons/qualia.htm Lormand, E. ''Qualia! Now Showing at a Theatre near you'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lucs.lu.se/ftp/pub/LUCS_Studies/LUCS58.pdf De Leon, D. ''The Qualities of Qualia''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226091151/http://www.lucs.lu.se/ftp/pub/LUCS_Studies/LUCS58.pdf |date=2007-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; against [[qualia]] in ''[[Consciousness Explained]]''. Qualia are attacked from several directions at once: he maintains they do not exist (or that they are too ill-defined to play any role in [[science]], or that they are really something else, i.e. behavioral [[disposition]]s). They cannot simultaneously have all the properties
attributed to them by philosophers—incorrigible, ineffable, private, directly accessible and so on. The [[multiple drafts]] theory is leveraged to show that facts about qualia are not definite. Critics   object that one's own qualia are subjectively quite clear and distinct to ''oneself''.

The self-replicating nature of memes is a partial explanation of the recurrence of indeterminacies in language and thought{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}. The wide influences of Platonism and Kantianism in Western philosophy can arguably be partially attributed to the indeterminacies of some of their most fundamental concepts (namely, the Idea and the [[Noumenon]], respectively).

For a given meme to exhibit replication and heritability&amp;nbsp;– that is, for it to be able to make an ''imperfect copy'' of itself which is more likely to share any given trait with its "parent" meme than with some random member of the general "population" of memes&amp;nbsp;– it must in some way be mutable, since memetic replication occurs by means of human conceptual imitation rather than via the discrete molecular processes that govern genetic replication. (If a statement were to generate copies of itself ''that didn't meaningfully differ from it'', that process of copying would more accurately be described as "duplication" than as "replication", and it would be incorrect to term these statements "memes"; the same would be true if the "child" statements did ''not'' noticeably inherit a substantial proportion of their traits from their "parent" statements.)
In other words, if a meme is defined roughly (and somewhat arbitrarily) as a statement (or as a collection of statements, like Foucault's "discursive formations") that inherits ''some'', but not ''all'', of its properties (or elements of its definition) from its "parent" memes and which self-replicates, then indeterminacy of definition could be seen as ''advantageous'' to memetic replication, since an absolute rigidity of definition would preclude memetic adaptation.

It is important to note that indeterminacy in [[linguistics]] can arguably partially be defeated by the fact that languages are always changing. However, what the entire language and its collected changes continue to reflect is sometimes still considered to be indeterminate.

===Criticism===

Persons of [[faith]] argue that faith "is the basis of all knowledge". The Wikipedia article on faith states that "one must assume, believe, or have ''faith'' in the credibility of a person, place, thing, or idea in order to have a basis for [[knowledge]]." In this way the object of one's faith is similar to Kant's [[noumenon]].

This would seem to attempt to make direct use of the indeterminacy of the object of one's faith as evidential support of its existence: if the object of one's faith were to be proven to exist (i.e., if it were no longer of indeterminate definition, or if it were no longer unquantifiable, etc.), then faith in that object would no longer be necessary; arguments from authority such as those mentioned above wouldn't either; all that would be needed to prove its existence would be scientific evidence. Thus, if faith is to be considered as a reliable basis for knowledge, persons of faith would seem, in effect, to assert that indeterminacy is not only necessary, but good (see [[Nassim Taleb]]).

==Indeterminacy in new physical theories==

[[Science]] generally attempts to eliminate vague definitions, causally inert entities, and indeterminate properties, via further observation, experimentation, characterization, and explanation. [[Occam's razor]] tends to eliminate causally inert entities from functioning models of quantifiable phenomena, but some quantitative models, such as [[quantum mechanics]], actually imply certain indeterminacies, such as the relative indeterminacy of quantum particles' positions to the precision with which their momenta can be measured (and vice versa). (See Heisenberg's [[indeterminacy principle]].)

One ardent supporter of the possibility of a final unifying theory (and thus, arguably, of the possibility of the end of some current indeterminacies) in physics, [[Steven Weinberg]], stated in an interview with PBS&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/view-weinberg.html Weinberg, S. PBS interview]&lt;/ref&gt; that:

"Sometimes [...] people say that surely there's no final theory because, after all, every time we've made a step toward unification or toward simplification we always find more and more complexity there. That just means we haven't found it yet. Physicists never thought they had the final theory."

The Wikipedia article on the possibility of such a "[[theory of everything]]" notes that

"Other possibilities which may frustrate the explanatory capacity of a TOE may include sensitivity to the boundary conditions of the universe, or the existence of mathematical chaos in its solutions, making its predictions precise, but useless."

[[Chaos theory]] argues that precise prediction of the behavior of complex systems becomes impossible because of the observer's inability to gather all necessary data.

As yet, it seems entirely possible that there shall never be any "final theory" of all phenomena, and that, rather, explanations may instead breed more and more complex and exact explanations of the new phenomena uncovered by current experimentation. In this argument, the "indeterminacy" or "thing in itself" is the "final explanation" that will never be reached; this can be compared to the concept of the limit in [[calculus]], in that quantities may approach, but never reach, a given limit in certain situations.

===Criticism===

Proponents of a [[deterministic]] universe have criticised various applications of the concept of indeterminacy in the sciences; for instance, [[Einstein]] once stated that "God does not play dice" in a succinct (but now unpopular)  argument against the theory of [[quantum indeterminacy]], which states that the actions of particles of extremely low mass or energy are unpredictable because an observer's interaction with them changes either their positions or momenta. (The "dice" in Einstein's metaphor refer to the ''probabilities'' that these particles will behave in particular ways, which is how [[quantum mechanics]] addressed the problem.)

At first it might seem that a criticism could be made from a [[biology|biological]] standpoint in that an indeterminate idea would ''seem'' not to be beneficial to the species that holds it.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} A strong counterargument, however, is that not all traits exhibited by living organisms will be seen in the long term as evolutionarily advantageous, given that extinctions occur regularly and that phenotypic traits have often died out altogether&amp;nbsp;– in other words, an indeterminate meme may in the long term demonstrate its evolutionary value to the species that produced it in ''either'' direction; humans are, as yet, the only species known to make use of such concepts.
It might also be argued that conceptual vagueness is an inevitability, given the limited capacity of the human nervous systems.  We just do not have enough neurons to maintain separate concepts for "dog  with 1,000,000 hairs", "dog with 1,000,001 hairs" and so on. But conceptual [[vagueness]] is not [[metaphysical indeterminacy]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Synonymous concepts in philosophy==
Uncertainty and indeterminacy are words for essentially the same concept in both quantum mechanics. Unquantifiability, and undefinability (or indefinability), can also sometimes be synonymous with indeterminacy. In science, indeterminacy can sometimes be interchangeable with unprovability or unpredictability. Also, anything entirely inobservable can be said to be indeterminate in that it cannot be precisely characterized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9699">An '''international reply coupon (IRC)''' is a coupon that can be exchanged for one or more [[postage stamp]]s representing the minimum postage for an unregistered priority airmail letter of up to twenty grams sent to another [[Universal Postal Union]] (UPU) member country. IRCs are accepted by all UPU member countries.

UPU member postal services are obliged to exchange an IRC for postage, but are not obliged to sell them.

The purpose of the IRC is to allow a person to send someone in another country a letter, along with the cost of postage for a reply. If the addressee is within the same country, there is no need for an IRC because a [[self-addressed stamped envelope]] (SASE) or [[return postcard]] will suffice; but if the addressee is in another country an IRC removes the necessity of acquiring foreign [[postage]] or sending appropriate [[currency]].

== History ==
The IRC was introduced in 1906 at a Universal Postal Union congress in [[Rome]]. At the time an IRC could be exchanged for a single-rate, ordinary postage stamp for surface delivery to a foreign country, as this was before the introduction of [[airmail]] services. An IRC is exchangeable in a UPU member country for the minimum postage of a priority or unregistered airmail letter to a foreign country.

The current IRC, which features the theme "Water for Life," designed by Czech artist and graphic designer Michal Sindelar, was issued in 2013 and is valid until 31 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upu.int/nc/en/activities/international-reply-coupons/about-irc.html |title=Universal Postal Union: About international reply coupons |website=Upu.int |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new design by Vietnamese artist Nguyen Du for 2017-2021 was adopted in Istanbul in 2016.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upu.int/en/activities/international-reply-coupons/new-illustration-for-2017-2021.html |title=Universal Postal Union: New illustration for 2017–2021 |website=Upu.int |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IRCs are ordered from the UPU headquarters in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]] by [[Postal administration|postal authorities]]. They are generally available at large [[post office]]s; in the U.S., they were requisitioned along with regular domestic stamps by any post office that had sufficient demand for them.
[[Image:British-International-Reply-Coupon.jpg|thumb|right|A British 1 Shilling IRC issued in 1959.]]
Prices for IRCs vary by country. In the [[United States]] in November 2012, the purchase price was $2.20&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pe.usps.com/cpim/ftp/manuals/dmm300/Notice123.pdf |title=International reply coupon cost listed on USPS Extra Service Price List|publisher=[[United States Postal Service]]|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[USD]]; however, the US Postal Service discontinued sales of IRCs on 27 January 2013 due to declining demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://about.usps.com/postal-bulletin/2012/pb22352/html/updt_005.htm |title=IMM Revision: Changes to Pricing and Mailing Standards for International Mailing Services |publisher=[[United States Postal Service]]|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's Royal Mail also stopped selling IRCs on 18 February 2012, citing minimal sales and claiming that the average post office sold less than one IRC per year. IRCs purchased in foreign countries may be used in the United States toward the purchase of postage stamps and embossed stamped envelopes at the current one-ounce First Class International rate ($1.05 USD as of April 2012) per coupon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pe.usps.com/text/imm/immc3_024.htm |journal=Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service - International Mail Manual|publisher=[[United States Postal Service]] |title=International Reply Coupons |issue=35 |date=12 May 2008 |accessdate=4 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IRCs are often used by [[amateur radio]] operators sending [[QSL card]]s to each other; it has traditionally been considered good practice and common courtesy to include an IRC when writing to a foreign operator and expecting a reply by mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.n6hb.org/s-a/irc.htm |title=International reply coupons |publisher=Amateur Radio Station N6HB |date=28 July 2007 |accessdate=7 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the operator's home country does not sell IRCs, then a foreign IRC may be used.

Previous editions of the IRC, the "Beijing" model{{what|date=January 2016}} and all subsequent versions, bear an expiration date. Consequently, a new IRC will be issued every three years.

== Current usage in various countries ==
===Hong Kong===
International reply coupons are sold by the HongKong Post for 19 HKD as of 2018-10-19. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HongKong Post International Reply Coupon |url=https://stamps.hongkongpost.hk/eng/newsletter/2017/10/20171018e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The [[Royal Mail]] stopped selling IRCs on 31 December 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalmail.com/reply-sender |title=Reply to sender |website=Upu.int |date= |accessdate=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to a lack of demand.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Ponzi scheme==
{{Main|Ponzi scheme}}

In 1920, [[Charles Ponzi]] made use of the idea that profit could be made by taking advantage of the differing postal rates in different countries to buy IRCs cheaply in one country and exchange them for stamps of a higher value in another country. This subsequently became the fraudulent '''Ponzi scheme'''.&lt;ref name="zuckoff"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckoff|first1=Mitchell|title=Ponzi's scheme - the true story of a financial legend|date=10 January 2006|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|location=New York|isbn=0812968360}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the overhead on buying and selling large numbers of the very low-value IRCs precluded any profitability.

The selling price and exchange value in stamps in each country have been adjusted to some extent to remove some of the potential for profit, but ongoing fluctuations in currency value and exchange rates make it impossible to achieve this completely, as long as stamps represent a specific currency value, instead of acting as vouchers granting specific postal services, devoid of currency nomination.

== U.S. Postal Service description of international reply coupons ==
International reply coupons&lt;ref&gt;section 380 Supplemental Services, subsection 381 International Reply Coupons.{{cite web|title=Summary of Changes, Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service, International Mail Manual, Issued July 7, 2014|url=http://pe.usps.com/cpim/ftp/manuals/imm/full/imm.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in French, ''Coupons-Reponse Internationaux'') are printed in blue ink on paper that has the letters “UPU” in large characters in the watermark. The front of each coupon is printed in French. The reverse side of the coupon, which has text relating to its use, is printed in German, English, Arabic, Chinese, Spanish, and Russian. Under Universal Postal Union’s regulations, participating member countries are not required to place a control stamp or postmark on the international reply coupons that they sell. Therefore, some foreign issue reply coupons that are tendered for redemption may bear the name of the issuing country (generally in French) rather than the optional control stamp or postmark.

The Nairobi Model was an international reply coupon printed by the Universal Postal Union which is approximately 3.75 inches by 6 inches and had an expiration date of December 31, 2013. This model was designed by Rob Van Goor, a graphic artist from the Luxembourg Post. It was selected from among 10 designs presented by Universal Postal Union member countries. Van Goor interpreted the theme of the contest – "The Postage Stamp: A Vehicle for Exchange" – by depicting the world being cradled by a hand and the perforated outline of a postage stamp.

The Doha Model is named for the 25th UPU congress held in Doha, Qatar, in 2012. The Doha model, designed by Czech artist and graphic designer Michal Sindelar, shows cupped hands catching a stream of water, to celebrate the theme of Water for Life. It expires after December 31, 2017.

The Istanbul Model was designed by graphic artist Nguyen Du's and features a pair of hands and a dove against an Arctic backdrop to represent sustainable development in the postal sector. Ten countries participated in the competition which was held Oct. 7, 2016, during the UPU congress in Istanbul, Turkey. It expires after December 31, 2021.

The United States Postal Service stopped selling international reply coupons on January 27, 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17340">[[Japanese verb conjugation]] is very regular, as is usual for an [[agglutinative language]], but there are a number of exceptions. The best-known irregular verbs are the common verbs する ''suru'' "do" and 来る ''kuru'' "come", sometimes categorized as the two [[Japanese consonant and vowel verbs|Group III verbs]]. As these are the only significantly irregular verbs, and the only verbs frequently flagged as irregular, it is sometimes incorrectly stated that these are the only irregular verbs in Japanese, but there are in fact more, about a dozen total, depending on how one counts. The other irregular verbs encountered at the beginning level are ある ''aru'' "be (inanimate)" and 行く ''iku/yuku'' "go", with the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] behaving similarly to an irregular verb.

There are also a few [[#Adjectives|irregular adjectives]], of which the most common and significant is 良い ''yoi'' "good".

== ''suru'' and ''kuru'' ==
[[File:AMB Japanese Verbs.pdf|thumb|page=2|Revision sheet including most irregular conjugations of ''suru'' and ''kuru'']]
The most significant irregular verbs are the verbs する ''suru'' "do" and 来る ''kuru'' "come", which are both very common and quite irregular. Often the conjugations behave as if they were instead the verb しる or す, or respectively きる or こる, where (other than す) these are vowel stem ("Group II", 1-row, monograde) conjugation (note that there are no ''-oru'' vowel stem verbs, though 来る sometimes behaves as if it were one), but beyond there are further exceptions. Historically する came from earlier す, which explains some of the irregularity. The following table is ordered to emphasize the regularities.
{| class="wikitable"

|-
| Imperative || しろ ''shiro,'' せよ ''seyo'' || 来い ''koi'' || しる、す and irregular
|-
| Conditional || すれば ''sureba'' || 来れば ''kureba'' || regular
|}

The irregular 〜ない ''-nai'' stem of する is often overlooked; it is used in grammatical forms where the 〜ない form is used without the 〜ない – generally formal – as in 食べず ''tabe-zu'' "without eating" or 食べんがため ''tabe-n ga tame'' "for the purpose of eating". In these contexts する becomes せ, as in せず ''se-zu'' "without doing" or せんがため ''se-n ga tame'' "for the purpose of doing". Note the similarity to 〜ません as the negative form of 〜ます, of the same origin.

The potential 来れる ''koreru'' form is from the omission of ''ra'' in the られる ''rareru'' potential form, and is found in all Group II verbs; it is considered an error by prescriptive grammarians, but is increasingly common, particularly in spoken speech and in younger Japanese.

== Basic grammar ==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
The [[Copula (linguistics)#Japanese|copula]] だ and です (polite), together with the verb ある ''aru'' "be (inanimate)", which is used grammatically, and the 〜ます suffix, which functions similarly to an irregular auxiliary verb, are all irregular to varying degrees, and particularly used in polite speech. It is debatable whether they should be classified as verbs or as different parts of speech.

Formally, the copula is である ''de aru''. This form is normal in writing, but in spoken Japanese it is almost universally contracted to だ ''da'', or in some dialects じゃ ''ja'' or や ''ya''. When conjugated politely, である ''de aru'' becomes であります ''de arimasu'' following the regular transformation. This form is normal in writing, except that most writing either uses plain conjugations or the honorific forms, so in fact this form is not commonly seen. In spoken Japanese, であります ''de arimasu'' is universally contracted to です ''desu''.

{| class="wikitable"

|-
|non-past || だ ''da''&lt;br/&gt;である ''de aru''*&lt;br/&gt;じゃ ''ja''** || です ''desu''&lt;br/&gt;であります ''de arimasu''* || でございます ''de gozaimasu'' || じゃない ''ja nai''&lt;br/&gt;ではない ''dewa nai''* || じゃないです ''ja nai desu''&lt;br/&gt;じゃありません ''ja arimasen''&lt;br/&gt;ではありません ''dewa arimasen''* || でございません ''de gozaimasen''

|}

(*) indicates literary forms

(**) じゃ ''ja'' is a dialectal spoken form of だ ''da''

== Polite verbs ==
{{see|Honorific speech in Japanese}}
The 5 special polite verbs have the slight irregularity that 〜る ''-ru'' changes to 〜い ''-i'' in the ''-masu'' stem (continuative form, 連用形) and imperative stem (命令形), as opposed to the expected ×〜り *''-ri'' and ×〜れ *''-re''. As these all end in ''-aru,'' these can be termed "''aru'' special class". The most commonly encountered of these is 〜ください, used for polite requests.

{| class="wikitable"
|base form || ''-masu'' form
|-
|いらっしゃる || いらっしゃいます
|-
|おっしゃる || おっしゃいます
|-
|くださる || くださいます
|-
|ござる || ございます
|-
|なさる || なさいます
|}

== Euphony ==
A few short verbs have irregular euphonic form (音便形) in 〜て/〜た ''-te/-ta'' form, most significantly 行く ''iku/yuku'' "go":
* 行く ''iku/yuku'' conjugates to 行って ''itte'' and 行った ''itta,'' not ×いいて *''iite'' or いいた *''iita''
* 問う・訪う ''tou'' "ask; visit, call on" conjugates to 問うて・訪うて ''toute,'' not *''totte''
* 請う・乞う ''kou'' "request; beg" conjugates to 請うて・乞うて ''koute,'' not *''kotte''
* 恋う ''kou'' "miss, yearn, pine" conjugates to 恋うて ''koute,'' not *''kotte''
These latter euphonic changes – ''-ott-'' → ''-out-'' (→ ''-ōt-'') – are regular in ''-te/-ta'' form in [[Kansai dialect]], e.g., しまった ''shimatta'' "done it; darn" → しもうた ''shimōta,'' but only occur in the above exceptions in standard Japanese.

Note that [[Japanese grammar#Euphonic changes .28.E9.9F.B3.E4.BE.BF onbin.29|euphonic change]] also results in some conjugations being uniform across the language, but irregular compared with other verbs. Most significantly, the た ''ta'' and て ''te'' forms ([[Japanese verb conjugation#Perfective|perfective]] and participle/[[Japanese verb conjugation#te form|gerundive]]) of consonant stem verbs all exhibit euphonic sound change, except for す ''su'' verbs.

The volitional form, as in 読もう ''yomō'' and 食べよう ''tabeyō'', does not correspond to a verb stem ending in ''-o'' but is actually formed from the irrealis ''-a'' stem, with a euphonic change of ''a'' to ''o'' – for example ''yomu'' &amp;gt; ''yoma-u'' &amp;gt; ''yomou'' = ''yomō''. Thus the apparent volitional "stem" is not seen in other contexts.

== Single kanji ''suru'' ==
While 〜する ''suru'' verbs following a two-kanji compound are regular (using the admittedly irregular conjugation of ''suru''), behaving as a kanji noun followed by an independent verb, there is irregular behavior for single kanji ''suru'' verbs, and they behave as a single fused word, with various forms and sometimes irregular conjugation.

Firstly, these exhibit sound changes, which two-kanji ''suru'' verbs do not, yield these forms (non-exhaustive list):
* 愛する ''ai-suru'' – no sound change
* 達する ''tas-suru'' – gemination (促音) from たつ+する ''tatsu+suru'' to たっする ''tas-suru''
* 禁ずる ''kin-zuru'' – voicing (連濁 ''[[rendaku]]'') from きん+する ''kin+suru'' to きんずる ''kin-zuru''
* 禁じる ''kin-jiru'' – ''-zuru'' verbs have an associated ''-jiru'' form, which is the more common form in modern Japanese

Secondly, the 〜る can be dropped (except from the 〜じる forms), corresponding to the earlier す form of する, yielding:
* 愛す ''ai-su''
* 達す ''tas-su''
* 禁ず ''kin-zu''

Finally, the する／す／ず may be conjugated in various ways, particularly in less common forms. This is particularly noticeable for 愛する.

== Alternative roots ==
For a few verbs, the root of the verb changes depending on context. Most significantly, these are:
* 〜得る ''-uru'' – auxiliary verb to indicate possibility, the ''u'' changes to ''e'' in the negative and polite forms, yielding 〜得る 〜うる ''-uru'' "... possible", 〜得ない 〜えない ''-enai'' "...impossible", and 〜得ます　〜えます ''-emasu'' "... possible (polite)". This is often written in kana, and is most familiar from ありうる ''ariuru'' "be possible" and ありえない ''arienai'' "be impossible".
* 行く ''iku, yuku'' "go" – some dialectical differences, but generally ''iku'' by itself and ''-yuki'' when used as a suffix, e.g., for train destinations.
*:There is some dialectical difference here as well, with ''iku'' as more standard, but ''yuku'' common in Western Japan(as well as song lyrics). By contrast, 言う ''iu, yuu'' "say" is only a dialectical difference, with ''iu'' standard, but ''yuu'' more common in Western Japan.

== Regular but unusual ==
Some verbs follow rules that are regular (in terms of the overall language), but relatively unusual or special. While not irregular per se, they present many of the same difficulties.

=== Irrealis form of ''u'' verbs ===
Verbs ending in う ''-u'' have the unusual irrealis ending ''-wa,'' as in 買わない ''ka-wa-nai,'' from 買う ''ka-u.'' This is due to these traditionally having a ''w,'' but the [w] being lost except as わ ''wa'' (and in を ''(w)o'' following an ん ''n'').

=== ''iru'' and ''eru'' verbs ===
{{main|Japanese consonant and vowel verbs}}
Most Japanese verbs are ''consonant stem'' (Group I, godan, ''u'' verb), though there is also the ''vowel stem'' category (Group II, ichidan, ''ru'' verb). All vowel stem verbs end in ''-iru'' or ''-eru,'' but not all verbs ending in ''-iru'' or ''-eru'' are vowel stem – some are instead consonant stem. Thus the conjugation type of a verb ending in ''-iru'' or ''-eru'' cannot be determined just from the dictionary form, and which verb is which must be memorized individually.

There are about a hundred such verbs with common examples being 知る ''shiru'' "know", 走る ''hashiru'' "run", 入る ''hairu'' "enter", and 帰る ''kaeru'' "return".

There are also homophone verbs that have either a vowel stem or a consonant stem; for example, 生きる ''ikiru''  "live, stay alive" and 寝る ''neru'' "sleep" have a vowel stem, but 熱る ''ikiru'' "become sultry" and 練る ''neru'' "temper, refine, knead" have a consonant stem.

=== ''nu'' verbs ===
死ぬ ''shinu'' is the only ぬ ''-nu'' verb, and thus its conjugations are less familiar, but is otherwise regular. There used to be other ぬ ''-nu'' verbs, notably 往ぬ／去ぬ いぬ ''inu'' "leave".

== Compound verbs ==
[[Japanese compound verbs]] are generally constructed using the ''masu'' stem form of the primary verb, as in 読み始める ''yomi-hajimeru'' "begin to read". In some cases compound verbs do not follow this pattern, generally due to sound change. Such exceptions include 振る舞う ''furu-mau'' "behave, conduct; treat (to food or drink)", from 振るう ''furuu'' + 舞う ''mau,'' instead of the regular ×振るい舞う *''furui-mau''.

== Abbreviations ==
There are various abbreviations in Japanese, primarily of nouns or of inflections, such as 〜ている to 〜てる or 〜ておく to 〜とく, or even 〜ているの to 〜てん, though verb roots only rarely change. One such example is in the verb いらっしゃる, which has the following abbreviated forms:
* いらっしゃって to いらして
* いらっしゃった to いらした

== Miscellaneous ==
The imperative form of the auxiliary verb 〜くれる ''-kureru'' is 〜くれ ''-kure,'' rather than the expected ×くれろ *''kurero.''

== Adjectives ==
Japanese adjectives, specifically ''i''-adjectives, function grammatically as verbs, though with more limited conjugation. There are a few irregularities of note. Most significantly, 良い ''yoi'' "good" is generally replaced by ''ii'' in the base form (''yoi'' is found in formal usage), though only ''yoi'' is used in conjugated forms such as 良く ''yoku'' and 良くない ''yokunai''.

There are more minor and subtler irregularities in certain constructions, particularly in adjectives with single-mora roots. In the ''-me'' form, adjectives can replace the ''-i'' with a 〜め ''-me'' (in kanji 〜目) to indicate "somewhat", as in 薄め ''usu-me'' "somewhat watery, weak" from 薄い ''usu-i'' "watery, weak". However, in some cases the ''-i'' is not dropped, notably 濃いめ ''ko-i-me'' "somewhat strong (tea etc.)", from 濃い ''ko-i.''

In the ''-sugiru'' form, verbs and adjective attach a 〜すぎる ''-sugiru'' (in kanji 〜過ぎる) to the stem to indicate "excessive" – for example 近すぎる ''chika-sugiru'' "too close", from 近い ''chika-i'' "close" – but in the case of a 〜ない ''-na-i'' negative ending (and standalone ない ''nai''), there is sometimes an intrusive 〜さ ''-sa,'' yielding 〜なさすぎる (standalone なさすぎる ''na-sa-sugiru'') instead of the expected 〜なすぎる ''-na-sugiru.'' Typically this is optional, and generally omitted, as in 忙しな（さ）すぎる ''sewashina(-sa)-sugiru'' "too restless", but for single-mora stems it is generally included, as in なさすぎる ''na-sa-sugiru'' "not too much", instead of marginal △なすぎる ?''na-sugiru''. There is considerable variation and uncertainty by native speakers, as these forms are uncommon. Further, this is confusingly similar to the intrusive 〜さ ''-sa'' when an adjective is followed by 〜そうだ ''-sō da'' "appears, seems", so 良さそうだ ''yo-sa-sō da'' "seems good" and 無さそうだ ''na-sa-sō da'' "seems not", but 良すぎる ''yo-sugiru'' "too good" and 無さすぎる ''na'''-sa'''-sugiru'' "too not, too absent".&lt;ref&gt;[http://d.hatena.ne.jp/higonosuke/20130710 2013-07-10 「なすぎる」？　「なさすぎる」？]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;明鏡国語辞典&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that 静けさ ''shizu-ke-sa'' "tranquility" is not an irregular derivation of 静か ''shizu-ka'' "quiet, still" – the regular derivation 静かさ ''shizu-ka-sa'' "quietness, stillness" exists and is used – but is rather a separate word of distinct etymology – in Old Japanese the root words were 静けし ''shizu-ke-shii'' and 静かなり ''shizu-ka-nari,'' to which the 〜さ ''-sa'' was separately affixed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/18139/whats-the-difference-between-静けさ-and-静かさ What's the difference between 静けさ and 静かさ?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
Some irregular verbs date at least to Old Japanese, notably する、来る、ある、死ぬ. The other ぬ verb いぬ also dates to Old Japanese, though is now no longer used, and 居る ''iru'' "be (animate)" was formerly をる ''woru'' and irregular, though it is now regular.

{{Commons category}}
'''Johannes Messenius''' (1579–1636) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[historian]], [[dramatist]] and university professor. He was born in the village of Freberga, in Stenby parish in [[Östergötland]], and died in [[Oulu]], in modern-day [[Finland]].

==Childhood==
He was the son of a [[miller]] named Jöns Thordsson. At an early age his brilliance caught the attention of a monastery priest named Magnus Andreae, who gave him guidance and taught him. Unbeknownst to the boy's parents, the priest sent him to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school in [[Braunsberg]], which was specialized in educating boys for winning [[Scandinavia]] back from [[Protestantism]].

==Seeking a position==
After seven years in Braunsberg, Johannes travelled across [[Europe]]. He visited [[Denmark]] in 1602, and in 1603, he was a dinner speaker at Bishop [[Piotr Tylicki]] in [[Kraków]]. He made a short visit in [[Rome]] in 1604, but the climate forced him to return to [[Germany]] where he possibly won an M.A. in [[Ingolstadt]], in 1605. He is also said to have received the title ''[[Poëta cæsarius]]'' ("poet of the Emperor") from emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]].

Johannes moved further north to the Jesuit hostel in [[Danzig]], he taught at a school in [[Braunsberg]], and eventually, he opened a private school in [[Danzig]], where he married Lucia Grothusen, the daughter of [[Arnold Grothusen]], the teacher of king [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund]].

By doing a [[panegyric]] work, ''Genealogia Sigismundi'', in 1608, he strove for receiving a better position from the king. When the king did not show the expected gratitude, Johannes returned to Sweden, hoping to reclaim his father's farm Långebro, which had been confiscated by the State.

==Back in Sweden==
Since [[Charles IX of Sweden]] was suspicious towards [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] and Jesuits, Johannes published a family tree of the kings ancestry, which showed how he was related to the many old dynasties of Europe. Through the intervention of his wife, Johannes received a repatriation permit, and after having given a vow of fealty, he received the position of professor of law and politics at [[Uppsala University]].

==Professorship==
Johannes began a productive period in his life, which showed considerable learning. In [[Danzig]], in 1605, his brethren among the Jesuits had informed the Swedish King Charles IX that Johannes had written a mocking poem on him. In order to convince everybody of his contempt for the Jesuits, he published two works. One was shorter and named ''Detecto Fraudis Jesuiticæ'', in 1610, and a longer in Swedish named ''Retorsion och genswars skrifft emoot then lögn och skamlig dicht'', which had already been published in [[German language|German]] in 1609.

He showed his newly acquired fidelity to the [[House of Vasa]] by a new genealogic work and by translating into [[Latin]] a number of writings against Sigismund of Poland (King Charles' brother). With fervour, he started to do research and to write on Swedish history, and his source criticism was a forerunner of modern history writing.

In a rapid succession, he published the following works:
*''Chronicon episcoporum per Sueciam, etc. (1611)
*''Tumbæ veterum ac nuperorum apud Sveones regum, reginarum, ducum etc.''
*''Sveopentaprotopolis, etc.''
*''Specula'' (1612 (published in [[French language|French]], in 1655)
*''Retorsio imposturarum'' (1612)
*''Theatrum nobilitalis suecance'' (1616), which was the first publication of the pedigrees of the Swedish nobility.

Beside this work, he also published older sources for historical studies. He published [[Ragnvald Ingemundsson]]'s Latin translation of the law of [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus Eriksson]], in 1614, [[Ericus Olai]]'s Swedish chronicle (1615), the ''Old Prose Chronicle'' and the ''Small Rhyme Chronicle'', [[Adam of Bremen]]'s description of Scandinavia and the beginning of the ''Large Rhyme Chronicle''. It is evident that this large amount of work did not guarantee an even and high quality, but the many editions of his works that were printed testify to their popularity.

As a professor and teacher at the university, he became very popular by his concerns for his students, and by teaching them according to the recent ''Braunberg methods''. He also made plays in the [[Swedish language]] a popular activity for young people and he also made dramas himself.

==Conflict==
However, his hubris, boasting and waywardness caused difficulties with his colleagues at the university, especially since [[Johannes Rudbeck]] became his main enemy. The students were finally divided into two factions, one for him, and the other one against him. The [[wikt:consistory|Consistory]] at Uppsala became the battle ground for open fights and antics (partly with Messentius' support) that became so serious that the [[chancellor]] [[Axel Oxenstierna]] had to intervene.

The two enemies were called to interrogation in [[Stockholm]], in front of the Church council in July 1613. After an investigation, there was a settlement, but both professors were moved from [[Uppsala]]. Messenius was entrusted the keeping of the kingdom's old archives, and he was promoted to assessor of the Swedish court of appeal (''Svea hovrätt''), in 1614.

==Dramatist==
This was the time, when he began to write his plays, which were to influence Swedish drama during the following century. He almost completely rejected the so-called ''school drama'', to which almost all previous Swedish plays had belonged. Instead, he rather followed the movement of the German [[Jakob Ayrer]].

However, his most successful decision was to write plays on Swedish history, as it was perceived in his time, i.e. including the [[Fornaldarsaga]]s. His most influential works were:
*[[Disas saga|Disa]] (1611, reprinted 7 times (1612–1740)).
*[[Hagbard and Signy|Signill]] (1612, reprinted 9 times (1612–1740)).
*Swanhuita (1613, reprinted 4 times (1635–1727)).
*Blanckamäreta (1614, reprinted 4 times (1614–1660s), on [[Blanka of Sweden]] and Margareta, a Danish princess who married king [[Birger, King of Sweden|Birger Magnusson]] of Sweden.
Encouraged by the success of his first two plays, he declared in the introduction of his third play that he intended to cover all of Sweden's history in 50 comedies and tragedies and make them public. Technically, his works were undeveloped and were a combination of ridiculous scenes with serious ones, and he had a certain feel for the presentation of dramatic effects. According to German tradition, he used people from the lower classes for comedy, but the scenes are usually disconnected from the rest of the play. The main play is organized as a series of dialogues that are loosely joined, and motivation and character depiction are considered to be very primitive. He paid close attention to the rendering of historic clothes, although the limited knowledge of his time showed its limitations in this respect. Occasionally, there are songs in the play, songs that belong to the best he has written, and they have been reprinted as late as 1879.

The works he wrote in prison, ''[[Christmannus]]'' and ''Gustavus'' are less known, and incorrectly attributed to his son. They consist of summaries in dialogue of the history of the church in Sweden. In the spite of its weaknesses, Messenius' dramas are considered to be the most original and most patriotic in Sweden's older literature, and the only part of Swedish literature from this time to have been generally praised.

==Imprisonment==
In 1616, he was accused of conspiring with king Sigismund and the Jesuits. He was found guilty as charged, when he could not find twelve men who swore that he was innocent. He was sentenced to death in July 1616, but the king changed the sentence to prison, probably for life.

In October 1616, he was transported to the desolate fortress [[Kajaani Castle]] at [[Finland]] near the Russian border, where he was harshly treated by its commander [[Erik Hara]]. He occupied himself with writing historical works and by doing research in Swedish source documents. Every once in a while, he sent pleas to king [[Gustav II Adolph]] and later to [[Christina of Sweden|Christina]]'s regency. In these pleas, he swore on his innocence, or referred to his works as reason for pardon. In 1635, he was moved to [[Oulu]], and had his pension doubled. At this time, the government sent him the translator [[Erik Schroderus]], to appraise himself of Messenius' monumental work ''[[Scondia illustrata]]'', which treated Sweden's history from the [[Deluge (mythology)|deluge]] to Messenius' own time. When Messenius suspected that the government wanted to publish the work in its own name, he demanded freedom for his son, who was also imprisoned, and free passage for himself to wherever he wished. These demands offended the regency who threatened to send him back to Kajaneborg.

Shortly, after this, Messenius died, and the government offered his widow 500 dollars for ''Scondia illustrata''. However, she left the kingdom with the manuscripts, and it was her son who later returned the text to Sweden in order to have it published. However, it took a long time to publish the work, and it was only thanks to [[Johan Peringskiöld]] that it was published in folio 1700–1705.

Considering the scholarly traditions of its time, and the conditions in which it was written, this monumental work can only be described as prominent. More than anyone else of his time, he mastered both Swedish and foreign historical literature. The seventh tome of ''Scondia'', which describes the religious conflicts of [[John III of Sweden]] is a model for history writing.

From his time in prison, there are also several other works, which are mostly still extant.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Ranju Hazarika was born in an Assamese family in [[Sonitpur]], formerly known as the [[Darrang district]] of Assam. He spent his childhood in the Monabari Tea Estate. Since childhood he had an inclination towards the literature and that eventually prompted him write few short stories and poems, those got published in few of the local news papers and magazines. At the age of fifteen, he finished writing the manuscript of his first Novel '''Bahurupi''', after appearing the [[All India Secondary School Examination|Class 10 Board Exams]].&lt;ref name="Pranoy 2006-06-05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarmah 2016-04-18"/&gt;

===First novel and beginning===

Along with his studies, Hazarika started his first job as an Accountant in the Cooperative society of the Monabari Tea State. Then, he got the chances to work in [[North-East Frontier Agency|NEFA]] and in the next one decade he served as an employee in two different Tea Estates. During those periods, he made the full utilization of his leisure time and his first novel ''Bahurupi'', that got published in the year 1973. Gradually, Hazarika started writing few other manuscripts of his famous novels like ''Klanta Surjyar Rashmi'', ''Sandhan'', ''Mayajaal'', ''Duranta Dashyu'', ''Nikhar Atithi'', ''Eta Dip Satta Kabar'', ''Gahin Banar Phool'',  ''Uttar Phalguni'', ''Tamas Tapashya'', ''Debajani'' etc. Initially he did not have any intention to publish them and dumped all the manuscripts of his novels in a tea box, which he names "A Dustbin of Stories &amp; Novels of Ranju Hazarika".&lt;ref name="Pranoy 2006-06-05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarmah 2016-04-18"/&gt;

===Jobs and career as a writer===

In 1982, he moved into the literature zone and started working as a fully fledged Editor in the famous Assamese ''Trishool'' magazine.

[[File:Marco_Terenzio_Varrone.jpg|thumb|An imagined portrait of an elderly Varro. Before 1923, artist unknown]]
'''Marcus Terentius Varro''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|n|ʃ|i|ə|s|_|ˈ|v|æ|r|oʊ}}; 116&amp;ndash;27 BC) was an [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] scholar and writer. He is sometimes called '''Varro Reatinus''' to distinguish him from his younger contemporary [[Varro Atacinus]].

==Biography==
[[File:Statua di Marco Terenzio Varrone (Rieti) 02.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Marcus Terentius Varro in [[Rieti]]]]
Varro was born in or near Reate (now [[Rieti]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marcus-Terentius-Varro|title=Marcus Terentius Varro {{!}} Roman author|newspaper=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a family thought to be of [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] rank, and always remained close to his roots in the area, owning a large farm in the [[Reatine plain]], reported as near Lago di&amp;nbsp;Ripa Sottile,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Varro/de_Re_Rustica/1*.html#note36|title=LacusCurtius • Varro On Agriculture — Book I|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his old age. He supported [[Pompey]], reaching the office of [[praetor]], after having been [[Tribune of the Plebs|tribune of the people]], ''[[quaestor]]'' and ''[[curule aedile]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_jhKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=VARRO+praetor,+after+having+been+tribune+of+the+people,+quaestor+and+curule+aedile.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-e0-NVeiMw&amp;sig=lLdrLmdjY2QINv504ivs-_RnMNY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7msz-77zRAhXFLSYKHe6cAFMQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=VARRO%20praetor,%20after%20having%20been%20tribune%20of%20the%20people,%20quaestor%20and%20curule%20aedile.&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and General Literature|last=Baynes|first=Thomas Spencer|date=1891-01-01|publisher=C.

During the [[Caesar's Civil War|civil war]] he commanded one of Pompey's armies in the [[battle of Ilerda|Ilerda campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hWSyDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=VARRO+CIVIL+WAR+ILERDA+CAMPAIGN&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MZZ0i-FZQl&amp;sig=AD-n4l8nppovJckhil1UYvwOMyY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidyNmz8bzRAhWEyyYKHXOTCmIQ6AEIPjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=VARRO%20CIVIL%20WAR%20ILERDA%20CAMPAIGN&amp;f=false|title=Civil War|last=Caesar|last2=Damon|first2=Cynthia|date=2016-05-23|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674997035|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He escaped the penalties of being on the losing side in the civil war through two pardons granted by [[Julius Caesar]], before and after the [[Battle of Pharsalus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3ZaIYAaOSQC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;lpg=PA214&amp;dq=varro+pardon+caesar+pharsalus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=997riJ-nCm&amp;sig=mr_vng1faF-xS3RygoCeGbcmnnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY4eSv8rzRAhVK7CYKHWznC0o4ChDoAQgaMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=varro%20pardon%20caesar%20pharsalus&amp;f=false|title=A History of Medicine: Roman medicine|last=Prioreschi|first=Plinio|date=1996-01-01|publisher=Horatius Press|isbn=9781888456035|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar later appointed him to oversee the public library of Rome in 47&amp;nbsp;BC, but following Caesar's death [[Mark Antony]] [[proscription|proscribed]] him, resulting in the loss of much of his property, including his library. As the Republic gave way to Empire, Varro gained the favour of [[Augustus]], under whose protection he found the security and quiet to devote himself to study and writing.

Varro studied under the Roman philologist [[Lucius Aelius Stilo Praeconinus|Lucius Aelius Stilo]], and later at [[Athens]] under the [[Academy|Academic]] philosopher [[Antiochus of Ascalon]]. Varro proved to be a highly productive writer and turned out more than 74 Latin works on a variety of topics. Among his many works, two stand out for historians; ''Nine Books of Disciplines'' and his compilation of the ''[[Varronian chronology]]''.  His ''Nine Books of Disciplines'' became a model for later [[encyclopedists]], especially [[Pliny the Elder]]. The most noteworthy portion of the ''Nine Books of Disciplines'' is its use of the [[liberal arts education|liberal arts]] as organizing principles.&lt;ref name=Lindberg&gt;{{cite book |title=The Beginnings of Western Science |last=Lindberg |first=David |year=2007 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-48205-7 |page=137 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dPUBAkIm2lUC&amp;pg=PA137|accessdate=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varro decided to focus on identifying nine of these arts: [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]], [[logic]], [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[astronomy]], musical theory, medicine, and [[architecture]]. Using Varro's list, subsequent writers defined the seven classical "liberal arts of the medieval schools".&lt;ref name=Lindberg/&gt;

==Calendars==
[[Image:Roman-calendar.png|thumb|400px|Fasti Antiates Maiores, an inscription containing the [[Roman calendar]]. This calendar predates the Julian reform of the calendar; it contains the months ''[[Quintilis]]'' and ''[[Sextilis]]'', and allows for the insertion of an [[intercalary month]]]]

The compilation of the ''[[Varronian chronology]]'' was an attempt to determine an exact year-by-year timeline of [[Roman history]] up to his time. It is based on the traditional sequence of the consuls of the [[Roman Republic]] — supplemented, where necessary, by inserting "dictatorial" and "anarchic" years. It has been demonstrated to be somewhat erroneous but has become the widely accepted standard chronology, in large part because it was inscribed on the [[Arch of Augustus, Rome|arch of Augustus]] in Rome; though that arch no longer stands, a large portion of the chronology has survived under the name of ''[[Fasti Capitolini]].''

==Works==
Varro's literary output was prolific; [[Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl|Ritschl]] estimated it at 74&amp;nbsp;works in some 620&amp;nbsp;books, of which only one work survives complete, although we possess many fragments of the others, mostly in Gellius' ''[[Attic Nights]]''. Called "the most learned of the Romans" by [[Quintilian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Quintilian |authorlink=Quintilian |title=[[Institutio Oratoria]] |chapter=Chapter 1 |chapterurl=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/10A*.html#1.95 |volume=Book X |at=Verse 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varro was recognized as an important source by many other ancient authors, among them [[Cicero]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Virgil]] in the ''Georgics'', [[Columella]], [[Aulus Gellius]], [[Macrobius]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and [[Vitruvius]], who credits him [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/7*.html#Intro.14 (VII.Intr.14)] with a book on architecture.

His only complete work extant, ''Rerum rusticarum libri tres'' (''Three Books on Agriculture''), has been described as "the well digested system of an experienced and successful farmer who has seen and practised all that he records."&lt;ref name=RFM&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Fairfax|title=Roman Farm Management|year=1918|publisher=The Macmillan Company|location=New York|pages=1–14 [10]|url=https://archive.org/details/romanfarmmanagem02harruoft|chapter=Note Upon the Roman Agronomists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One noteworthy aspect of the work is his anticipation of [[microbiology]] and [[epidemiology]]. Varro warned his contemporaries to avoid swamps and marshland, since in such areas

&lt;blockquote&gt;there are bred certain minute creatures which cannot be seen by the eyes, but which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and cause serious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Varro |first=Marcus Terentius |date=16 September 2014 |origyear=1934 |title=De Re Rustica |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Varro/de_Re_Rustica/1*.html#12.2 |publisher=Loeb Classical Library |at=I.12.2 |via=Bill Thayer's Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Thompson |first=Sue |date=March 2014 |title=From Ground to Tap |url=http://mag.digitalpc.co.uk/fvx/rsc/themole/1403/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012012410/http://www.rsc.org/eic/sites/default/files/The-Mole-March-2014-corrected.pdf |archivedate=12 October 2014 |journal=The Mole |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |page=3 (sidebar) |access-date=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hempelmann |first1=Ernst |last2=Krafts |first2=Kristine |date=October 2013 |title=Bad Air, Amulets and Mosquitoes: 2,000 Years of Changing Perspectives on Malaria |url=https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2875-12-232 |journal=Malaria Journal |volume=12 |page=232 |doi=10.1186/1475-2875-12-232 |issn=1475-2875 |access-date=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2016 she was one of the keynote speakers at the [[European Second Language Association|EUROSLA26]] at the [[University of Jyväskylä]], [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jyu.fi/en/congress/eurosla26|title=EuroSLA 26|date=31 August 2018|publisher=University of Jyväskylä}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Verspoor has published articles in journals such as [[Applied Linguistics (journal)|Applied Linguistics]], [[Journal of Second Language Writing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1060374312000240|title=Verspoor, M., Schmid, M. &amp; Xu, X.

(2015). Dynamic Development in Speaking Versus Writing in Identical Twins. Language Learning, 65(2), 298-325.|date=2015|publisher=[[Language Learning (journal)|Language Learning]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2004 she wrote a seminal article along with [[Kees de Bot|de Bot]] and [[Wander Lowie|Lowie]] on second language development, in which she applied the [[dynamic systems theory]] to study [[second language writing]] development. This was the first research paper in which [[time-series data]] were used to explicate changes in the development of second language writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/publications/dynamic-systems-theory-and-variation-a-case-study-in-l2writing(fe120ba4-defa-4577-b34b-daf6ff7fbb76).html|title=Dynamic systems theory and variation: a case study in L2-writing|date=2004|publisher=Amsterdam: Free University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Verspoor presented ''A dynamic perspective on developmental patterns in Finnish as an L2'' at the ELC 4. Fourth International Postgraduate Conference on Language and Cognition at the [[University of Vigo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.uvigo.es/video/5b5b52eb8f4208617811135f|title=Instruction or not? A dynamic perspective on developmental patterns in Finnish as an L2|date=2015|publisher=UVigoTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Verspoor's first article was published in which she and her colleagues applied the [[Hidden Markov Model]] to simulate language development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://journals.openedition.org/rdlc/1450|title=Linguistic complexity in second language development: variability and variation at advanced stages|date=2017|publisher=Recherches en didactique des langues et des culture. Les cahiers de l'Acedle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also noted for her work on [[language complexity]]. She proposed the finite verb ratio index to measure general syntactic complexity and the average word length of content words to gauge lexical complexity in [[second language writing]] development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1908">A '''micro schaft''', also '''microschaft''', is an Anglicized [[loanword]] [[portmanteau]] of micro(scopic) (Greek ''mikrós'', small) and ''landschaft'' (German for landscape), lit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6124">'''Moyshe Kulbak''' ({{lang-yi|משה קולבאַק}}, {{lang-be|Майсей (Мойша) Кульбак}}; 1896, [[Smarhoń]]{{spaced ndash}}1937, near  [[Minsk]]) was a [[Yiddish-language]] writer.

==Overview==
Born in [[Smarhon]] (present-day [[Belarus]], then a town of Russian empire) to a [[Jewish people|Jewish]] family, Kulbak studied at the [[Volozhin Yeshiva]] in [[Belarus]] (then in the Russian empire).

During the [[World War I|First World War]] he lived in Kovno (today, [[Kaunas]], Lithuania), where he began to write poetry in Hebrew, before switching to Yiddish.&lt;ref name="Novershtern"&gt;Novershtern, Avraham (August&amp;nbsp;19, 2010). "[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Kulbak_Moyshe Kulbak, Moyshe]." ''YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe''. yivoencyclopedia.org. Retrieved 2016-12-25.&lt;/ref&gt; He made his publishing debut in Yiddish in 1916,&lt;ref name="Novershtern"/&gt; with the poem "Shterndl" (Little star). In 1918 he moved to the city of [[Minsk]];&lt;ref name="Novershtern"/&gt; in 1919, after the Soviet Revolution, to Vilna (today [[Vilnius]], Lithuania); and in 1920 to [[Berlin]].

In 1923 he came back to Vilna, which after the war had become part of newly independent [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], and was a center of Yiddish literary culture. In Vilna he taught modern Yiddish literature at the Real-Gymnasium (a Yiddish-speaking high school), as well as at the Yiddish teachers' seminary.&lt;ref name="EncyclJudaica"&gt;Liptzin, Sol; Zutra, Itay B. (2007). "Kulbak, Moyshe". ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA. Vol. 12, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1928 he became disappointed with the literary atmosphere in Poland, and decided to return to Minsk (capital of the Soviet Belarus), where much of his family lived, and where there was a lively Yiddish literary scene.&lt;ref name="Novershtern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EncyclJudaica"/&gt;

In Minsk, Kulbak worked for several media organizations and for the Jewish section of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Belarus|Academy of Sciences of Belarus]].

Kulbak wrote poems, fantastical or "mystical" novels, and, after moving to the [[Soviet Union]], what are described by one source as "Soviet" satires. His novel ''The Zelmenyaners'' depicted with some realism the absurdities of Soviet life.

His mystical novella ''The Messiah of the House of Ephraim'' (1924) draws together many strands of Jewish folklore and apocalyptic belief, presenting them from a perspective that owes much to [[Germany|German]] expressionist cinema. It principally concerns the poor man Benye, who may or may not be a [[Messiah]], and whose destiny is intertwined with the [[Lamed vavnik|Lamed-Vavniks]]. (In Jewish mysticism, the Lamed-Vavniks are a group of 36 holy Jews on whose goodness the whole of humanity depends.) Benye, and the many other characters, undergo experiences the strangeness of which approaches incomprehensibility, to themselves as well as the reader. Legendary figures such as [[Lilith]] and Simkhe Plakhte are characters in the novel.

In September 1937, Moyshe Kulbak was arrested during a wave of Stalinist purges. He was accused of [[espionage]] and executed a month later together [[1937 mass execution of Belarusians|with several dozens of other Belarusian writers, intellectuals and administrators]]. In 1956, after the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], he was officially rehabilitated by the Soviet authorities&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.svaboda.org/a/28777235.html Расстраляныя літаратары.

[http://www.midrasz.pl/ Midrasz] ([[Warsaw]]), October 2007. p. 48. The article makes clear that Moyshe Kulbak was arrested in September 1937 and executed one month later. Even so, in many encyclopedia articles (similarly to the case of Isaac Babel) 1940 is given as the date of his death.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2323">'''Naimark's problem''' is a question in [[functional analysis]] asked by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Mark Naimark|last=Naimark|year=1951}}. It asks whether every [[C*-algebra]] that has only one [[irreducible representation|irreducible &lt;math&gt; * &lt;/math&gt;-representation]] up to [[Self-adjoint operator#Spectral theorem|unitary equivalence]] is [[isomorphic]] to the &lt;math&gt; * &lt;/math&gt;-algebra of [[Compact operator on Hilbert space|compact operator]]s on some (not necessarily separable) [[Hilbert space]].

The problem has been solved in the affirmative for special cases (specifically for separable and Type-I C*-algebras). {{harvtxt|Akemann|Weaver|2004}} used the [[diamond principle|&lt;math&gt; \diamondsuit &lt;/math&gt;-Principle]] to construct a [[C*-algebra]] with &lt;math&gt; \aleph_{1} &lt;/math&gt; generators that serves as a counterexample to Naimark's Problem. More precisely, they showed that the statement "'''There exists a counterexample to Naimark's Problem that is generated by [[Aleph One|&lt;math&gt; \aleph_{1} &lt;/math&gt;]] elements'''" is &lt;u&gt;independent&lt;/u&gt; of the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and the [[axiom of choice|Axiom of Choice]] (&lt;math&gt; \mathsf{ZFC} &lt;/math&gt;).

Whether Naimark's problem itself is independent of &lt;math&gt; \mathsf{ZFC} &lt;/math&gt; remains unknown.

'''''Naming and Necessity''''' is a 1980 book with the transcript of three lectures, given by the philosopher [[Saul Kripke]], at [[Princeton University]] in 1970, in which he dealt with the debates of [[proper noun|proper name]]s in the philosophy of language.&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. 1980. ''Naming and Necessity''. [[Harvard University Press]]: 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The transcript was brought out originally in 1972 in ''Semantics of Natural Language'', edited by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] and [[Gilbert Harman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=vsb-CAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=1972&amp;f=false|title=Semantics of Natural Language|last=Davidson|first=D.|last2=Harman|first2=Gilbert|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789401025577|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among analytic philosophers, ''Naming and Necessity'' is widely considered one of the most important philosophical works of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Soames, Scott. 2005.

==Overview==
Language is a primary concern of [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]], particularly the use of language to express concepts and to refer to individuals.
In ''Naming and Necessity'', Kripke considers several questions that are important within analytic philosophy:
*How do names refer to things in the world? (the problem of [[intensionality]])
*Are all statements that can be known ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' [[Logical truth|necessarily true]], and are all statements that are known ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' [[contingency (philosophy)|contingently true]]?
*Do objects (including people) have any [[essential properties]]?
*What is the nature of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]?
*How do [[natural kind]] terms refer and what do they mean?

Kripke's three lectures constitute an attack on [[Descriptivist theory of names|descriptivist theories of proper names]]. Kripke attributes variants of descriptivist theories to [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[John Searle]], among others. According to descriptivist theories, proper names either are synonymous with descriptions, or have their reference determined by virtue of the name's being associated with a description or cluster of descriptions that an object uniquely satisfies. Kripke rejects both these kinds of descriptivism. He gives several examples purporting to render descriptivism implausible as a theory of how names get their reference determined (e.g., surely Aristotle could have died at age two and so not satisfied any of the descriptions we associate with his name, and yet it would seem wrong to deny that he was Aristotle). As an alternative, Kripke adumbrated a [[causal theory of reference]], according to which a name refers to an object by virtue of a causal connection with the object as mediated through communities of speakers. He points out that proper names, in contrast to most descriptions, are [[rigid designator]]s: A proper name refers to the named object in every possible world in which the object exists, while most descriptions designate different objects in different possible worlds. For example, 'Nixon' refers to the same person in every possible world in which Nixon exists, while 'the person who won the United States presidential election of 1968' could refer to Nixon, Humphrey, or others in different possible worlds.

Kripke also raised the prospect of [[A posteriori necessity|''a posteriori'' necessities]] — facts that are [[Logical truth|necessarily true]], though they can be known only through empirical investigation. Examples include "Hesperus is Phosphorus", "Cicero is Tully", "Water is H2O" and other identity claims where two names refer to the same object.

Finally, Kripke gave an argument against identity materialism in the philosophy of mind, the view that every [[mental fact]] is identical with some physical fact (See talk). Kripke argued that the only way to defend this identity is as an ''a posteriori'' necessary identity, but that such an identity — e.g., pain is C-fibers firing — could not be necessary, given the possibility of pain that has nothing to do with C-fibers firing. Similar arguments have been proposed by David Chalmers.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, David. 1996. ''The Conscious Mind.'' [[Oxford University Press]] pp. 146-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kripke delivered the John Locke lectures in philosophy at Oxford in 1973. Titled ''Reference and Existence'', they are in many respects a continuation of ''Naming and Necessity'', and deal with the subjects of fictional names and perceptual error. They have recently been published by Oxford University Press. [[Quentin Smith]] has claimed that some of the ideas in ''Naming &amp; Necessity'' were first presented (at least in part) by [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Quentin. ''Marcus, Kripke, and the Origin of The New Theory of Reference'', Synthese, Volume 104, No. 2, August 1995, pp. 179-189.&lt;/ref&gt; Kripke is alleged to have misunderstood Marcus' ideas during a 1969 lecture which he attended (based on the questions he asked), and later arrived at similar conclusions. Marcus, however, has refused to publish the verbatim transcript of the lecture. Smith's view is controversial, and several well-known scholars (for example, [[Stephen Neale]] and [[Scott Soames]]) have subsequently offered detailed responses arguing that his account is mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;^ Stephen Neale (9 February 2001). "No Plagiarism Here" (.PDF). Times Literary Supplement 104: 12–13. {{doi|10.1007/BF01063869}}. http://web.gc.cuny.edu/philosophy/people/neale/papers/NealeKripke.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

== A theory of naming ==

In the first lecture, Kripke introduced a schematic semi-formal version of the kind of "theory of naming" he was ''criticising'' (1980:64–65).&lt;ref&gt;"[[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]]'s investigation of '[[Dthat]]', mentioned in footnote 22 [of ''Naming and necessity''], has been extended to a 'logic of demonstratives' in which, he says, a good deal of the argument of this paper [''Naming''] can be given a formal representation. Indeed a good deal of this paper suggests a certain formal apparatus, though the present presentation is informal." Kripke (1980): 164.&lt;/ref&gt; He began the second lecture by recapitulating the "theses" of this theory, together with the "noncircularity condition" he had discussed in closing the first lecture. Apparently, the theses and condition had been written up on a board for all to see. This text was reproduced, as quoted below, in the "lightly edited" transcript of 1980 (p.&amp;nbsp;71).

# To every name or designating expression &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''X''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, there corresponds a cluster of properties, namely the family of those properties φ such that ''A'' believes 'φ''X''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
# One of the properties, or some conjointly, are believed by ''A'' to pick out some individual uniquely.
# If most, or a weighted most, of the φ's are satisfied by one unique object ''y'', then ''y'' is the referent of &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''X''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
# If the vote yields no unique object, &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''X''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; does not refer.
# The statement, 'If ''X'' exists, then ''X'' has most of the φ's' is known ''a priori'' by the speaker.
# The statement, 'If ''X'' exists, then ''X'' has most of the φ's' expresses a necessary truth (in the idiolect of the speaker).
:(C) For any successful theory, the account must not be circular. The properties which are used in the vote must not themselves involve the notion of reference in such a way that it is ultimately impossible to eliminate.

==Lecture I: January 20, 1970==
Kripke's main goals in this first lecture are to explain and critique the existing philosophical opinions on the way that names work.

In the mid-20th century, the most significant philosophical theory about the nature of [[names]] and naming was a theory of [[Gottlob Frege]]'s that had been developed by [[Bertrand Russell]], the [[descriptivist theory of names]], which was sometimes known as the 'Frege-Russell description theory'. Before Kripke gave his 'Naming and Necessity' lectures, a number of criticisms of this descriptivist theory had been published by leading philosophers, including [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[John Searle]] and [[Peter Strawson]]. However, Kripke believed that the existing arguments against the Frege-Russell descriptive theory of names failed to identify the real problems with the theory.

==Lecture II: January 22, 1970==
In 'Lecture II', Kripke reconsiders the cluster theory of names and argues for his own position on the nature of reference, a position that contributed to the development of the [[causal theory of reference]].

==Lecture III: January 29, 1970==
In 'Lecture III', Kripke discusses [[natural kind]]s, develops the distinction between epistemic and metaphysical necessity, and discusses the [[mind–body problem]] in [[philosophy of mind]].

Kripke begins by summarising the conclusions drawn in the first two lectures. First, the referent of names is not usually fixed by some property or set of properties that the speaker believes are possessed by the thing or person named. Instead, the referent of names is usually determined by a series of causal links between people who have used the name. Second, when the referent of a name ''is'' determined by a property attributed to the thing named, the link is contingent, rather than necessary or essential. People begin using the name '[[Jack the Ripper]]' to refer to the person responsible for the murder of five women in London. So, the name was fixed to its referent by a description. However, the person who carried out the murders might have been jailed for another crime and, thus, might never have had the property of murdering those women. So, the link between the property of being a murderer and the person referred to is contingent. Third, identity is not a relation that holds between names. It is a relation that holds between an object and itself. When someone accurately claims that two names refer to the same object, the claim is necessarily true, even though it may be known ''a posteriori''. Thus, Kripke claims to have successfully refuted the assumption made by everyone before him that anything that is [[Logical truth|necessarily true]] will be known ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''  (i.e. Immanuel Kant 1781/1787).

==Importance==
In ''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century: Volume 2: The Age of Meaning'', Scott Soames wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the philosophy of language, ''Naming and Necessity'' is among the most important works ever, ranking with the classical work of Frege in the late nineteenth century, and of Russell, Tarski and Wittgenstein in the first half of the twentieth century . . . ''Naming and Necessity'' played a large role in the implicit, but widespread, rejection of the view—so popular among ordinary language philosophers—that philosophy is nothing more than the analysis of language.&lt;ref&gt;Soames, Scott. 2005. ''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century: Volume 2: The Age of Meaning''. [[Princeton University Press]]. Cited in Byrne, Alex and Hall, Ned. 2004. 'Necessary Truths'.

'''Online charging system''' ('''OCS''') is a system allowing a [[communications service provider]] to charge their customers, in real time, based on service usage.

==Architecture==
===Event based charging ===
Event based charging function (EBCF) is used to charge events based on their occurrence rather than their duration or volume used in the event. Typical events are SMS, MMS, purchase of a content (application, game, music, video on demand, etc.).

Event based charging function is used when the CC-Request-Type AVP = 4 i.e. for event request ex: diameter-sms or diameter-.....

===Session based charging ===

The session based charging function (SBCF) is responsible for online charging of network / user sessions, e.g. voice calls, IP CAN bearers, IP CAN session or IMS sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite | institution = 3rd Generation Partnership Project | series = Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects; Telecommunication management; Charging management | title = Packet Switched (PS) domain charging (Release 15) | edition = 15.0.0 | url = http://www.3gpp.org/ftp//Specs/archive/32_series/32.251/ | date = September 2017 | accessdate = 2017-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Account and balance management ====
The account balance management function (ABMF) is the location of the subscriber’s account balance within the OCS.

[[File:Q3A Plattenbau Vorderseite.jpg|thumb|Q3A-frontal view]]
[[File:Q3A Plattenbau Rueckseite.jpg|thumb|Rear view]]
'''Q3A''' is an abbreviation for a type of three, four and five storey [[prefabricated building]]s constructed in the [[East Germany|GDR]] in the 1950s and 1960s. The letter "Q" in the word stands for "Querwandbau" (cross wall construction).

==Description==

In a Q3A panel house, the walls are constructed entirely from concrete blocks, while the ceiling consists of multiple concrete plates that were placed perpendicular to, and on top of the wall elements. This explains the source of the "cross wall construction" name. The flat roof construction is the most visible difference between the Q3A series and other East Germany buildings of its time. Q3A homes are equipped with a furnace for heating, and a balcony for use by tenants was also provided in approximately half the cases. In later years (after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and [[German Reunification]]), most houses were retrofitted with additional balconies.

The concrete blocks and ceiling elements of the first houses were manufactured at an industrial plant in the Ostseestrasse in Berlin. Other types of panel construction used for Q3A houses were the IW57- and IW58-types. These were produced in much smaller numbers, with some even lacking the signature flat roof, being built with a more classic [[Hip_roof|Hip Roof]].

Shortly after the first houses were erected in 1957 in the eight quarters of [[East Berlin]], further series utilizing cross wall construction were developed. The QX-series, which were mostly 4-storey buildings, were not constructed from blocks, but from cheaper concrete strips. Most buildings of this series can be found in the "Hans-Loch" quarter, which was the first, newly constructed, large-scale settlement in East Berlin after the end of the Second World War. It is worth noting, that while Q3A block buildings were used in most areas of the GDR, the QX-series was constructed on a relatively limited basis. It is therefore regarded as an experimental series.

Further developments of cross-wall panel buildings happened from 1959 to 1983. These, even more frequently built homes, had the building type designation QP or QP64, for those mainly built in 1964. They were built with five, eight or ten storeys and in contrast to the two previous Q-series buildings, fulfilled the existing building codes by being furnished with a lift. The QP-series was the first type of house utilizing larger, industrial-sized panels. Each individual plate forms a complete wall of a room. The most striking and visible feature of many houses in the QP series is the colouring of the exterior walls, usually consisting of white or yellow tiles. The first buildings of this series originated in Berlin, between [[Strausberg]] and the [[Alexanderplatz]], in the western half of the former Stalin Avenue as well as the Hans-Loch Quarter.

The early 1970s were marked by the arrival of by far the most common series -- the WBS70 (Wohnungsbauserie 70). Approximately 900,000 apartment units of this type were constructed -- consisting of five-, six- and eleven-storey buildings. Other large-panel series were the [[P2 (panel building)|P2]] and [[WHH GT 18]] series. These were constructed as part of the "Sonderbauprogramm Berlin" (special construction program Berlin), which allocated special funds to improving the housing of what was then, the capital of the GDR -- East Berlin.

'''Shi''', or '''Nyabungu''', is a [[Bantu language]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

The Nyindu variety is heavily influenced by [[Lega language|Lega]], and speakers consider it a dialect of Lega rather than Shi, as Shi speakers see it. Maho (2009) leaves it unclassified as JD.501.&lt;ref name="Guthrie"/&gt;

'''Shlomo Zalman Auerbach''' ({{lang-he-n|שלמה זלמן אויערבאך}}; July 20, 1910 - February 20, 1995) was a renowned [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] [[rabbi]], [[posek]], and [[rosh yeshiva]] of the [[Kol Torah]] yeshiva in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]].  The Jerusalem neighborhood [[Ramat Shlomo]]  is named after Rabbi Auerbach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jerusalem.muni.il/en/CapitalofIsrael/neighborhoods/Pages/PageSite_2281.aspx |title= Ramat Shlomo |publisher=Jerusalem Municipality | |accessdate=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Shlomo Zalman Auerbach was the first child to be born in the [[Shaarei Chesed]] neighborhood of [[Jerusalem]] founded by his maternal grandfather, Rabbi [[Shlomo Zalman Porush]], after whom he was named.&lt;ref name="Sofer"/&gt; His father, Rabbi [[Chaim Yehuda Leib Auerbach]], was [[rosh yeshiva]] of [[Shaar Hashamayim Yeshiva]], and his mother was Rebbetzin Tzivia.

By the age of eleven he was proficient in the entire [[talmudic]] [[tractate]] of [[Nashim|Kiddushin]]. As a teenager he attended the [[Etz Chaim Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem. He was known for his diligence which is illustrated by an event which occurred while he was in yeshiva. On the day the first [[automobile]] rolled into Jerusalem along the [[Jaffa Road]], all the students left their studies to marvel at the horse-less wagon. Only young Shlomo Zalman remained in his chair immersed in his studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Teller|first=Hanoch|authorlink=Hanoch Teller| title = And From Jerusalem, His Word: Stories and insights of Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, zt"l |year=1995| publisher = N.Y.C. Publishing Co.| location = [[New York City|New York]]| isbn = 1-881939-05-7|accessdate=19 December 2010 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mxf2QDFNvcYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=And+From+Jerusalem+His+Word#v=onepage&amp;q=horse-less%20wagon&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following his marriage, he studied under Rabbi [[Zvi Pesach Frank]] at [[Kollel]] Kerem Tzion which focused on the [[Halacha|laws]] of the [[Land of Israel]].  He was known as one of the [[Haredi Judaism|Charedi]] [[Ashkenazi]] supporters for [[Heter Mechira]] during the [[Shmita]] year.

His first major published work, ''Meorei Esh'', was the first ever written on the subject of using electricity on [[Shabbat]]. The work was endorsed by Rabbi [[Chaim Ozer Grodzinski]] who read it and declared: ''"Or chadash al Tziyon ta'ir"'' — "A new light will shine upon Zion" — a quote from the daily [[Jewish services|morning prayers]].

He had a close association with Rabbi [[Chaim Ozer Grodzinski]], as well as the [[Chazon Ish]] and Rabbi [[Elazar Menachem Shach]], the two iconic and preeminent leaders of Lithuanian [[Haredi]] Judaism of the first and middle segments of the 20th century. He became the pre-eminent halachic decisor of his time in Israel, respected by all streams of Orthodox Judaism. He was unique in his approach to halacha through [[thought experiment]]s.

He was the brother-in-law of Rabbi [[Sholom Schwadron]], who married his sister Leah. The two shared a long and close relationship as learning partners and personal friends.

Renowned for his lucid classes as Rosh Yeshiva, his thousands of students continue to influence the Torah world today. 

An estimated 300,000 - 500,000 people attended his funeral in 1995. He was interred on [[Har HaMenuchot]].

===Children===
Rabbi Auerbach had seven sons and three daughters. His sons are:
* Rabbi [[Shmuel Auerbach]], leader of the ''Bnei Torah'' political party, d. 2018
* Rabbi [[Ezriel Auerbach]], a son-in-law of Rabbi [[Yosef Shalom Elyashiv]], and the [[Rov]] of [[Chanichei Hayeshivot]] in [[Bayit Vegan]]
* Rabbi Avraham Dov Auerbach, a rabbi in [[Tiberias]]
* Rabbi Mordechai Auerbach, the pulpit rabbi of Avir Ya'akov in [[Tel Aviv]]
* Rabbi Ya'akov Auerbach, a rabbi in [[Beit Shemesh]]
* Rabbi Meir Simcha Auerbach, a [[posek]] and [[Rosh Yeshiva]] in [[Betar Illit]]
* Rabbi Baruch Auerbach, who published the complete works of Rabbi [[Yom Tov Algazi]], and was killed in an automobile accident in 1999.

Rabbi Auerbach's daughters:
*Rachel, married to Rabbi [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]], a leading [[posek]] in Israel
*Miriam, married to Rav Treger, living in [[Antwerp]]
*Malka, married to Rav Bordiansky

===Prominent students===
*Rabbi [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]], his son-in-law.
*Rabbi [[Meir Kessler]]
*Rabbi [[Avigdor Nebenzahl]]
*Rabbi [[Yehoshua Neuwirth]]

==Works==
[[File:Grave of Shlomo Zalman Auerbach.jpg|thumb|250px|Tombstone of Rabbi Auerbach]]
[[Sefer (Hebrew)|Sefarim]] authored by Rabbi Auerbach include:
*'''''Meorei Eish''''', a pioneering work concerning [[electricity]] in halacha, (1935)
*'''''Ma'adanei Eretz''''', a two-volume book regarding agricultural halacha, (1946)
*'''''Minchas Shlomo''''' ([[responsa]]), first volume (1986), second volume (2003)
*'''''Minchas Shlomo''''', a commentary on the [[Talmud]]

He also authored a commentary on ''[[Shev Shema'tata]]'', which itself is a work of novellae on the Talmud by Rabbi [[Aryeh Leib HaCohen Heller]].

Most of Rabbi Auerbach's halachic rulings were delivered orally and not published formally. However, his rulings on medical halacha were summarized and publicized by Rabbi [[Yehoshua Yeshaya Neuwirth|Yehoshua Neuwirth]] in his  book ''[[Shemirat Shabbat Kehilchatah]]'', Rabbi Dr. [[Abraham S. Abraham]] in his ''Nishmat Avraham'', and Rabbi Dr. Avraham Steinberg in his ''Encyclopedia Hilchatit Refuit''.&lt;ref name="stone"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefoundationstone.org/en/beitmidrash/general/3025-medical-halachic-decisions-of-rabbi-shlomo-zalman-auerbach.html |title=Medical-Halachic Decisions of Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach |last=Steinberg |first=Avraham |year=2008 |accessdate=2 January 2011 |publisher=The Foundation Stone |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218235837/http://www.thefoundationstone.org/en/beitmidrash/general/3025-medical-halachic-decisions-of-rabbi-shlomo-zalman-auerbach.html |archivedate=18 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Neuwirth also made many of Rabbi Auerbach's rulings on Hilkhot Shabbat (Shabbat laws) widely known in his bestselling book, which was first published in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Milestones.pdf |title=

'''Siouan''' or '''Siouan–Catawban''' is a [[language family]] of [[North America]] that is located primarily in the [[Great Plains]], [[Ohio]] and [[Mississippi]] valleys and southeastern North America with a few other languages in the east.

==Name==
Authors who call the entire family ''Siouan'' distinguish the two branches as ''[[Western Siouan languages|Western Siouan]]'' and ''[[Eastern Siouan languages|Eastern Siouan]]'' or as ''Siouan-proper'' and ''Catawban''. Others restrict the name "Siouan" to the western branch and use the name ''Siouan–Catawban'' for the entire family. Generally, however, the name "Siouan" is used without distinction.

==Family division==

Siouan languages can be grouped into the [[Western Siouan languages]] and [[Catawban languages]]. The Western Siouan languages can be divided into Missouri River languages (such as [[Crow language|Crow]] and [[Hidatsa language|Hidatsa]]), [[Mandan language|Mandan]], Mississippi River languages (such as [[Sioux language|Dakotan]], [[Chiwere language|Chiwere]]-[[Winnebago language|Winnebago]], and [[Dhegihan languages|Dhegihan]] languages), and [[Ohio Valley Siouan languages|Ohio Valley Siouan]] branches. The Catawban languages consist only of [[Catawba language|Catawban]] and [[Woccon language|Woccon]].

==Proto-Siouan==

===Previous proposals===
There is a certain amount of [[comparative method|comparative work]] in Siouan–Catawban languages. Wolff (1950–51) is among the first and more complete works on the subject. Wolff reconstructed the system of proto-Siouan, and this was modified by Matthews (1958). The latter's system is shown below:

|
|
|}
With respect to vowels, five oral vowels are being reconstructed {{IPA|/*i, *e, *a, *o, *u/}} and three [[nasal vowel]]s {{IPA|/*ĩ, *ã, *ũ/}}. Wolff also reconstructed some consonantal clusters {{IPA|/*tk, *kʃ, *ʃk, *sp/}}.

===Current proposal===
Collaborative work involving a number of Siouanists started at the 1984 Comparative Siouan Workshop at the University of Colorado with the goal of creating a comparative Siouan dictionary that would include Proto-Siouan reconstructions.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, Robert L., Carter, Richard T., Jones, A. Wesley, Koontz, John E., Rood, David S. &amp; Hartmann, Iren (Eds.). (2015). ''Comparative Siouan Dictionary''. Leipzig, Germany: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. (Available online at http://csd.clld.org, Accessed on 2015-12-13.)&lt;/ref&gt; This work yielded a different analysis of the phonemic system of Proto-Siouan, which appears below:&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, Robert L., Carter, Richard T. &amp; Jones, A. Wesley (n.d.). ''Proto-Siouan Phonology and Grammar''. Ms. University of Kansas.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Siouanist literature (e.g., Rankin et al. 2015), [[Americanist phonetic notation#Consonants|Americanist phonetic]] transcriptions are the norm, so IPA *{{IPA|ʃ}} is Americanist *š, IPA *j is Americanist *y, and so on.

The major change to the previously-proposed system by systematically accounting for the distribution of multiple stop series in modern Siouan languages by tracing them back to multiple stop series in the proto-language. Previous analysis posited only a single stop series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wolff | first1 = Hans | year = 1950 | title = Comparative Siouan II. | url = | journal = International Journal of American Linguistics | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 113–121 | doi=10.1086/464075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the consonant clusters proposed by Wolf (1950{{endash}}1951) can be accounted for due to [[syncope (phonology)|syncopation]] of short vowels before stressed syllables. For example, Matthews (1958: 129) gives *wróke as the proto-form for 'male.' With added data from a larger set of Siouan languages since the middle of the twentieth century, Rankin et al. (2015) give *waroː(-ka) as the reconstructed form for 'male.'

Unlike Wolff and Matthew's proposals, there are no posited nasal consonants in Proto-Siouan. Nasal consonants only arise in daughter languages when followed by a nasal vowel.&lt;ref&gt;Some Siouan languages have however developed a phonemic contrast between the non-nasal sonorants w- and r- and the corresponding nasals m- and n-. These historical developments are presented in the following article:
 {{cite journal |last1=Michaud|first1=Alexis | authorlink1 =Alexis Michaud|last2=Jacques |first2=Guillaume |last3=Rankin|first3=Robert L.|year=2012 |title=Historical Transfer of Nasality Between Consonantal Onset and Vowel: From C to V or from V to C? |journal=Diachronica |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=201–230 |publisher= |doi= 10.1075/dia.29.2.04mic|url=http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00580260/en/  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition, there is a set of sounds that represent obstruentized versions of their corresponding sonorants. These sounds have different reflexes in daughter languages, with *w appearing as [w] or [m] in most daughter languages, while *W has a reflex of [w], [b], [mb], or [p]. The actual phonetic value of these obstruents is an issue of some debate, with some arguing that they arise through geminated *w+*w or *r+*r sequences or a laryngeal plus *w or *r.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, Robert L., Carter, Richard T. &amp; Jones, A. Wesley. (n.d.). ''Proto-Siouan Phonology and Grammar''. Ms. University of Kansas.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vowels====
Previous work on Proto-Siouan only posited single vowel length. However, phonemic vowel length exists in several Siouan languages such as [[hidatsa language|Hidatsa]], [[winnebago language|Ho-Chunk]], and [[tutelo language|Tutelo]]. Rankin et al. (2015) analyze numerous instances of long vowels as present due to common inheritance rather than common innovation. The five oral vowels and three nasal vowels posited by earlier scholars is expanded to include a distinction between short and long vowels. The proposed Proto-Siouan vowel system appears below:

==External relations==
The [[Yuchi language|Yuchi]] isolate may be the closest relative of Sioux–Catawban, based on both sound changes and morphological comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://langsci-press.org/catalog/view/94/120/445-1|title=A distant genetic relationship between Siouan-Catawban and Yuchi|last=Kasak|first=Ryan|date=2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, [[Robert Gordon Latham|Robert Latham]] suggested that the Siouan languages are related to the [[Caddoan languages|Caddoan]] and [[Iroquoian languages]]. In 1931, [[Louis Allen]] presented the first list of systematic correspondences between a set of 25 lexical items in Siouan and Iroquoian. In the 1960s and 1970s, [[Wallace Chafe]] further explored the link between Siouan and Caddoan languages. In the 1990s, [[Marianne Mithun]] compared the morphology and syntax of all the three families.  At present, this [[Macro-Siouan languages|Macro-Siouan]] hypothesis is not considered proved, and the similarities between the three families may instead be due to their protolanguages having been part of a [[sprachbund]].&lt;ref&gt;Mithun, Marianne. 1999. ''The languages of native North America''. p.305. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Syntaxis''' is a style in writing or in [[rhetoric]] that favors complex [[syntax]], in contrast to the simple [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] structures of [[parataxis]]. For example, 19th-century [[German language|German]] academic [[prose]], and [[John Milton]]'s "[[Paradise Lost]]" poetry in [[English language|English]] are notably syntactic.  Syntaxis may – depending on the author – also contrast with, or include, [[hypotaxis]].

A '''winemaking cooperative''' is an [[agricultural cooperative]] which is involved in [[winemaking]], and which in similarity to other [[cooperative]]s is owned by its members.&lt;ref name="OCW coop"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=[[Jancis Robinson]] | encyclopedia=[[Oxford Companion to Wine]] |edition= Third |title=Co-operatives |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-860990-6 |pages=197–198 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The members in a winemaking cooperative are usually [[vineyard]] owners, who deliver [[grape]]s to the cooperative, which is involved in production of wine from the grapes and the subsequent [[marketing]] activities.

Winemaking cooperatives are responsible for a significant proportion of the total wine production in many major wine-producing countries, including most of the classical [[Europe]]an wine countries, but their importance varies much between different [[wine region]]s within these countries. Cooperatives tend to be more important in regions where the wine’s selling price is relatively low and average size of vineyard holdings is small.&lt;ref name="OCW coop"/&gt;

While some winemaking cooperatives were established in the 19th century, the majority were established in the early 1930s following the [[Great Depression]].

== Advantages to members ==

The advantage to members of a cooperative, in comparison to pursuing winemaking and marketing on their own, consists in pooling resources and sharing costs for winemaking and marketing, which call for costly equipment and technical expertise. There are also other financial advantages, including certain [[European Union]] subsidies for cooperatives located in EU countries.&lt;ref name="OCW coop"/&gt;

Wines from cooperatives are often allowed to be described as producer-bottled according to the [[wine law]]s of the country in question, which is sometimes an advantage in marketing. The [[French wine|French]] term corresponding to this is ''mis(e) en bouteille à la propriété'', while the [[German wine|German]] is ''Erzeugerabfüllung''.

== Alternatives available to wine-growers ==

Producing and marketing the wine on his or her own is usually not a realistic possibility for many vineyard owners with small holdings. However, being a member of a winemaking cooperative is not the only option available. Selling grapes on the open market, entering into long-term contracts with [[negociant]]s or other winemaking companies and leasing out the vineyard to certain negociants are other options. The relative attractiveness of these options varies greatly between regions. As an example, in regions characterised by constant [[wine lake|overproduction of wine]], the market price of grapes is often depressed to a very low level, while grapes in [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne]] command much higher prices as long as they fulfill some basic criteria.

== France ==
[[File:Maraussan la cave cooperative.jpg|thumb|The winemaking cooperative in [[Maraussan]] in the Languedoc region is one of France's oldest.]]

In [[France]], winemaking cooperatives are typically called ''caves coopératives'', and produce more than half the total amount of French wine.&lt;ref name="OCW coop"/&gt; The first winemaking cooperative was established in [[Alsace]] in 1895,&lt;ref&gt;World Atlas of Wine, 2001 Edition, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; although at this time Alsace was part of the [[German Empire]] rather than France. Members of French winemaking cooperatives own more than half the total French vineyard surface. The ''caves'' have their greatest strength on the [[Vin de pays]] level, where they are responsible for about three-quarter of the production. They have been involved in the large-scale switch over of the French wine production from the lower [[Vin de table]] category to Vin de pays. Many cooperatives also produce an impressive range of [[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]] (AOC) wine.

The total number of French winemaking cooperatives was over 850 in the early 2000s, with an average membership of 160 per cooperative in the 1990s. Cooperatives are particularly strong in [[Languedoc wine|Languedoc]], [[Roussillon wine|Roussillon]], [[Rhône wine|Rhône]], [[Provence wine|Provence]] and [[Corsica wine|Corsica]]. Some of the more notable cooperatives are also found in [[Alsace wine|Alsace]] and [[Chablis (wine)|Chablis]].&lt;ref name="OCW coop"/&gt;

== Germany ==

In [[Germany]], a winemaking cooperative is often called ''Winzergenossenschaft'', but can also be called ''Winzerverein'', ''Winzervereinigung'', ''Weingärtnergenossenschaft'' or ''Weinbauerverband''. The earliest German winemaking cooperatives date back to the time before the later association laws were established. A union of winemakers in [[Neckarsulm]] in [[Württemberg (wine region)|Württemberg]] [[pressed (wine)|pressed]] grapes and sold the resulting must, and to some extent also wine, cooperatively as early as 1834. [[Prussia]] passed an association law (''Genossenschaftsgesetz'') in 1867, which became law in the entire [[North German Confederation]] in 1868. One of the first winemaking cooperatives founded on the basis of this legislation, ''Winzerverein [[Mayschoß]]'', was established in 1868 in the [[Ahr (wine region)|Ahr]] region and is the oldest German winemaking cooperative still in existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-winzergenossenschaften.de/inhalte/geschichte.htm Association of German winemaking cooperatives: Historical overview], accessed on July 2, 2008 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two thirds of all German vine-growers belong to a cooperative, but because of a dominance of small vineyard holdings and part-time vine growing among these members, their production is slightly less than one-third of the German total.&lt;ref name="OCW coop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WZG Anteil"&gt;[http://www.deutsche-winzergenossenschaften.de/inhalte/statistiken/WWJ/geno.%20Weinerzeugung%20internet%202009.pdf Weinerzeugung insgesamt und genossenschaftlicher Anteil], accessed 2011-01-23 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008/2009, there were 209 cooperatives in Germany with a total of 51 000 members and {{convert|32115|ha}} vineyard surface.&lt;ref name="Entw WZG"&gt;[http://www.deutsche-winzergenossenschaften.de/inhalte/statistiken/WWJ/WG-Entwicklung%20internet%202009.pdf Entwicklung der Winzergenossenschaften], accessed 2011-01-23 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a trend to fewer cooperatives (275 existed in 1998/1999) due to fusions.

A special form of winemaking cooperative is the ''Zentralkellereien'', a centralized cooperative found in many German wine regions, where local cooperatives rather than individual growers deliver grapes, [[grape must]] or wine. Therefore, of the 209  cooperatives existing in Germany in 2008/2009, only 120 actually produced wine on their own premises.&lt;ref name="OCW coop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Entw WZG"/&gt;

Cooperatives are particularly important in [[Württemberg (wine region)|Württemberg]], where they account for 80% of the production (2008),&lt;ref name="WZG Anteil"/&gt; [[Baden (wine region)|Baden]], where they account for 76%, and the smallest German wine regions Ahr, [[Hessische Bergstrasse]], [[Saale-Unstrut (wine region)|Saale-Unstrut]] and [[Saxony (wine region)|Saxony]].

== Southern Europe ==

In southern Europe, cooperatives are responsible for a large part of the wine production. Figures of around 60 percent have been quoted for [[Italy]]’s ''cantina sociale'' and cooperatives in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. However, in contrast to the situation in France and Germany, a large proportion of the cooperatives’ wine is not bottled by the cooperative, but instead is sold in bulk for bottling by commercial operators or, especially in the case of Spain, for [[distillation]].&lt;ref name="OCW coop"/&gt;

== Other countries ==

In [[South Africa]], [[KWV]] (''Koöperatieve Wijnbouwers Vereniging van Zuid-Afrika'') was originally formed as a winemaking cooperative which also had certain regulatory privileges akin to those of a [[government agency]]. However, in 2002, KWV was transformed into a regular commercial company.&lt;ref name="OCW KWV"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=[[Jancis Robinson]] | encyclopedia=[[Oxford Companion to Wine]] |edition= Third |title=KWV |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-860990-6 |pages=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4577">[[File:Yeghische Tourian.jpg|thumb|Patriarch Sir Yeghishe Tourian, KBE (Hon.)]]
[[Knighthood|Sir]] '''Yeghishe Tourian''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] ({{lang-hy|Եղիշե Դուրյան}}, 23 February 1860 – 27 April 1930) was [[List of Armenian Patriarchs of Jerusalem|Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem]] serving [[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem]] from 1921 to 1929. He took over the position after the patriarchate position remained vacant for 11 years (1910–1921).

Born in [[Constantinople]] in the district of [[Uskudar]] as Mihran Tourian,  he was the younger brother of Western Armenian poet and playwright [[Bedros Tourian]]. He was a staunch believer in education. In Constantinople, he published a series of textbooks for teaching of Armenian ''{{lang|hy|Ընթացք ի գրոց բարբառ}}'', with first volume in 1880 and second volume in 1883, ''{{lang|hy|Ընտիր ասացվածք օտարազգի նշանավոր անձանց}}'' (1882), ''{{lang|hy|Պատմություն հայ մատենագրության}}'' (1885). In 1909 he published his poems, and regularly contributed to Armenological studies in various publication under the title ''{{lang|hy|Հովվական սրինգ}}''.

He was the [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople]] from 1909–10. Then moved to Jerusalem where he was consecrated as Patriarch. He engaged in vast educational reform and in 1925, established a unified elementary school to accommodate the growing number of children in the community. He also modernized the curriculum of the Armenian Seminary and acquiring highly qualified instructors from the cadre of talented teachers and educators who had come to Jerusalem as refugees after the [[Armenian Genocide]]. In 1929, the unified elementary school officially opened its doors. By consolidating disparate locations, including the St. Gayane Girls' School, this new elementary school became the primary Armenian co-educational institution in the [[Holy Land]] and was renamed "School of the Holy Translators" (in Armenian "Serpots Tarkmantchats Varjaran").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenian-patriarchate.org/page2.html History of the Armenian Patriarchate of St. James in Jerusalem ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting 1927, he resumed the publication of ''[[Sion (periodical)|Sion]]'' ({{lang-hy|Սիոն}}) as the official organ of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem. His collections and writings were published in Jerusalem in a multi-volume series by "Matenashar Tourian" dedicated to his name. It also contained some of his poems under the title ''Srpazan Knar'' ({{lang|hy|Սրբազան քնար}}).

He was awarded an honorary [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] in the British [[1930 New Year Honours]] List by [[King George V]] and as a colonial subject of the [[British Empire]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], he was required to use the title [[Knighthood|Sir]], although it was not a compulsory honorific since he was not a full British citizen.&lt;ref&gt;http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C10384489&lt;/ref&gt;

Patriarch Torkom Koushagian wrote a lengthy study about his legacy first in a series in Egyptian Armenian daily ''[[Arev (daily)|Arev]]'' and later in a separate publication in Jerusalem.

Yeghishe Tourian was succeeded by Patriarch [[Torkom Koushagian]].
