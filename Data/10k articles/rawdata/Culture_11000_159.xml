'''Aerial perspective''' or '''atmospheric perspective''' refers to the effect the atmosphere has on the appearance of an object as it is viewed from a distance. As the distance between an object and a viewer increases, the [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between the object and its background decreases, and the contrast of any markings or details within the object also decreases. The colours of the object also become less [[saturation (color theory)|saturated]] and shift towards the background colour, which is usually blue, but under some conditions may be some other colour (for example, at sunrise or sunset distant colours may shift towards red).

==History==

Aerial perspective was used in paintings from the Netherlands in the 15th century, and explanations of its effects were with varying degrees of accuracy written by [[polymath]]s such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The latter used aerial perspective in many of his paintings such as the [[Mona Lisa]] and [[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]. Atmospheric perspective was used in Pompeian Second Style paintings, one of the [[Pompeian Styles]], dating as early as 30 BCE. A notable example is the Gardenscape from the Villa of Livia in Primaporta, Italy.

==Optics==

The major component affecting the appearance of objects during [[daylight]] is [[scattering]] of light, called [[Diffuse sky radiation|skylight]], into the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] of the viewer. Scattering occurs from molecules of the air and also from larger particles in the atmosphere such as water vapour and smoke (see [[haze]]). Scattering adds the sky light as a [[veiling luminance]] onto the light from the object, reducing its contrast with the background sky light. Skylight usually contains more light of short [[wavelength]] than other wavelengths (this is why the sky usually appears blue), which is why distant objects appear bluish (see [[Rayleigh scattering]] for detailed explanation). A minor component is scattering of light out of the line of sight of the viewer. Under daylight, this either augments the contrast loss (e.g., for white objects) or opposes it (for dark objects). At night there is effectively no skylight (unless the [[moon]] is very bright), so scattering out of the line of sight becomes the major component affecting the appearance of [[self-luminous]] objects. Such objects have their contrasts reduced with the dark background, and their colours are shifted towards red.

==Why reducing contrast reduces clarity==

The ability of a person with normal [[visual acuity]] to see fine details is determined by his or her [[contrast sensitivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, D. H. (1977). Visual contrast sensitivity. Optica Acta, 24, 107-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrast sensitivity is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the smallest contrast for which a person can [[Contrast (vision)|see]] a sine-wave [[grating]]. A person's [[contrast sensitivity function]] is contrast sensitivity as a function of [[spatial frequency]]. Normally, peak contrast sensitivity is at about 4 cycles per degree of [[visual angle]]. At higher spatial frequencies, comprising finer and finer lines, contrast sensitivity decreases, until at about 40 cycles per degree even the brightest of bright lines and the darkest of dark lines cannot be seen.

The high spatial frequencies in an image give it its fine details.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, R., &amp; Sekuler, R. (2006). Perception (5th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing the contrast of an image reduces the visibility of these high spatial frequencies because contrast sensitivity for them is already poor. This is how a reduction of contrast can reduce the clarity of an image—by removing its fine details.

It is important to emphasize that reducing the contrast is not the same as [[Focus (optics)|blurring]] an image. Blurring is accomplished by reducing the contrast only of the high spatial frequencies. Aerial perspective reduces the contrast of all spatial frequencies.

==In art==

In art, especially painting, ''aerial perspective''  refers to the technique of creating an illusion of depth by depicting distant objects as paler, less detailed, and usually bluer than near objects.

[[File:Frans Koppelaar - Backlight Langestraat.jpg|thumb|[[Frans Koppelaar]], Backlight Langestraat|left]]
(One caution: in common speech, the words ''perspective'' and ''viewpoint'' tend to be used interchangeably; however, in art, aerial perspective does not imply an [[aerial viewpoint]], such as that forming the basis of the [[aerial landscape]] genre. The example by [[Frans Koppelaar]] pictured here shows the difference. This landscape is a good example of aerial perspective; however, it is not an aerial landscape, since the observer is apparently standing on the ground.)

'''''L'Alliance Française''''' ({{IPA-fr|aljɑ̃s fʁɑ̃sɛːz}}; "French Alliance"), or '''AF''', is an international organization that aims to promote [[French language]] and [[French culture|culture]] around the world. Created in Paris on 21 July 1883 under the name ''Alliance française pour la propagation de la langue nationale dans les colonies et à l'étranger'' (French alliance for the propagation of the national language in the colonies and abroad) — now known simply as ''Alliance Française'' — its primary concern is teaching French as a [[second language]] and is headquartered in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliancefr.org/en/ |title=Homepage |website=Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the ''Alliance'' has 850 centers in 137 countries, on each inhabited continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.francophonie.org/IMG/pdf/oif_synthese_anglais_001-024.pdf |format=PDF |title=The French Language Worldwide 2014 |location=Paris |publisher=Nathan |isbn=978-2-09-882654-0 |via=Francophonie.org |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bulletin n°1 Alliance française - avril 1884.jpg|thumb|right|upright|First publication of the Alliance française in 1884.]]
The ''Alliance'' was created in Paris on 21 July 1883 by a group including the scientist [[Louis Pasteur]], the diplomat [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], the writers [[Jules Verne]] and [[Ernest Renan]], and the publisher [[Armand Colin]].

It finances most of its activities from the fees it receives from its courses and from rental of its installations. The [[French government]] also provides a [[subsidy]] covering approximately five percent of its budget (nearly 665,000 [[€]] in 2003)

More than 440,000 students learn French at one of the centres run by the ''Alliance'', whose network of schools includes:
* a centre in Paris, Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France
* locations throughout France for foreign students and
* 1,016 locations in 135 countries.

The organizations outside Paris are local, independently run [[Franchising|franchises]]. Each has a committee and a president. The ''Alliance Française'' [[brand]] is owned by the Paris centre. In many countries, the ''Alliance Française'' of Paris is represented by a ''Délégué général''. The French Government also runs 150 separate French Cultural Institutes that exist to promote [[French language]] and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://institut-francais.org.uk/ |title=Institut français du Royaume-Uni &amp;#124; French Cultural Institute in South Kensington |publisher=Institut-francais.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2005, along with the [[Società Dante Alighieri]], the [[British Council]], the [[Goethe-Institut]], the [[Instituto Cervantes]], and the [[Instituto Camões]], the Alliance française was awarded the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] for outstanding achievements in communications and the humanities.

*Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France

The Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France is a Higher Private Education Institute. It is an association from the law 1901.
Located in the heart of the capital, the Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France is a genuine international meeting point where more than 11,000 students from '''160 different countries''' come every year to learn French. It is also the oldest one since the school offers courses in Paris since 1894.

The 110 faculty teachers at the Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France are all certified in teaching [[French as a foreign language]].

Until 2007, the year of creation of the Alliance Française Foundation, the Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France was called "the Paris Alliance Française".

It was divided into three branches: the International Relations (DRI), the School of Paris, and the Department of Human and Financial Resources (DRHF). In 2007, the DRI has become the Alliance Française Foundation, while the School and the DRHF became the Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France.

Three conventions are now governing the relations between the Foundation and the Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France:
* a financial agreement: the Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France supports the Foundation financially.
* an agreement for the premises: the Paris Alliance Française donated its building in Boulevard Raspail to the Foundation at the time of the division in 2007
* a teaching agreement: the Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France supports the Alliances Françaises worldwide in their projects to professionalize their teaching and administrative staff. More than 40 missions per year are made abroad.

The Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France works with Alliances Françaises from around the world, ministries, public bodies, and also large companies, supporting them in their desire to improve their command of the language in a '''professional environment'''.

It is also a '''training center for French language teachers'''. Each year, nearly 2,300 teachers across the world are trained on site or remotely, initial or continuing training.

It delivers '''specific diplomas for French teachers''' such as the 'DAEFLE' (Diplôme d'Aptitude à l'Enseignement du Français Langue Étrangère), created with the 'CNED' (National Center for Distance Education) or the 'DPAFP – FLE' (Diplôme Professionnel de l'Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France en Français Langue Étrangère), which you obtain in five months after an initial training on site.

It also offers '''summer teaching courses for French teachers''' wishing to deepen and improve their knowledge.
The Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France has been awarded the FLE Quality Label, achieving top marks for each of the criteria studied by the auditors: welcome, quality of teaching, premises, school management.

It is also co-founder of [[Association of Language Testers in Europe|ALTE (Association of Language Testers in Europe)]], an association that includes some of the most prestigious European institutions in the field of evaluation in foreign language.

Since 2010, it is the provider of the 'OFII' (French Office for Immigration and Integration) for language training of the signatories of the Contract Integration living in Paris.

The '''areca nut''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ær|ᵻ|k|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|iː|k|ə}}) is the fruit of the [[areca]] palm (''[[Areca catechu]]''), which grows in much of the tropical Pacific ([[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]]), Southeast and South Asia, and parts of east Africa. It is commonly referred to as '''betel nut''' so it is easily confused with [[betel]] (''Piper betle'') leaves that are often used to wrap it (''[[paan]]'').  The term ''areca'' originated from the Kannada word ''adike'' (ಅಡಿಕೆ)&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}} Additional information: [[Cognate]]s include [[Kannada]] ''adike''/ಅಡಿಕೆ, [[Malayalam]] ''adakka''/''ataykka'', and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] ''adakkai''.&lt;/ref&gt; and dates from the 16th century, when Dutch and Portuguese sailors took the nut from Kerala to Europe. Consumption has many harmful [[#Effects on health|effects on health]] and is [[carcinogen]]ic to humans. Various compounds present in the nut, including [[arecoline]] (the primary psychoactive ingredient which is similar to nicotine), contribute to histologic changes in the [[oral mucosa]]. It is known to be a major risk factor for cancers ([[squamous cell carcinoma]]) of the [[oral cancer|mouth]] and [[esophageal cancer|esophagus]]. As with [[chewing tobacco]], its use is discouraged by [[preventive healthcare|preventive]] efforts. Consumption by hundreds of millions of people worldwide – mainly with southern and eastern Asian origins – has been described as a "neglected global [[public health]] emergency".

== Description ==

The areca nut is not a [[true nut]], but rather a fruit categorized as a [[berry]]. It is commercially available in dried, cured, and fresh forms. When the husk of the fresh fruit is green, the nut inside is soft enough to be cut with a typical knife. In the ripe fruit, the husk becomes yellow or orange, and as it dries, the fruit inside hardens to a wood-like consistency. At that stage, the areca nut can only be sliced using a special [[scissors]]-like cutter.

Usually for chewing, a few slices of the nut are wrapped in a [[betel]] leaf along with [[calcium hydroxide]] (slaked lime) and may include [[clove]], [[cardamom]], [[catechu]] (''kattha''), or other spices for extra flavouring.  Betel leaf has a fresh, peppery taste, but it can also be bitter to varying degrees depending on the variety.

Areca nuts are chewed with betel leaf for their effects as a mild stimulant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gupta Prakash Chandra |author2=Ray Cecily S |title=Epidemiology of betel quid usage |journal=Ann. Acad. Med. Singap. |volume=33 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=31–6 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15389304 |doi= |url=http://www.annals.edu.sg/pdf200409/V33N4p31S.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612061329/http://www.annals.edu.sg/pdf200409/V33N4p31S.pdf |archivedate=2009-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; causing a warming sensation in the body and slightly heightened alertness, although the effects vary from person to person.

[[File:Betal-nut.jpg|thumb|Areca Nuts also known as "Betal Nuts" plants in Nepal. These types of nuts are commonly found in the Terai region of Nepal.]]

The areca nut contains the tannins [[arecatannin]] and [[gallic acid]]; a fixed oil [[Natural gum|gum]]; a little [[terpineol]]; [[lignin]]; various saline substances; and three main [[alkaloids]]—[[arecoline]], [[arecaidine]], and [[guvacine]]—all of which have [[vasocontrictor|vasoconstricting]] properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/a/areca056.html |title=Modern herbal |publisher=Botanical.com |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The betel leaf chewed along with the nut contains [[eugenol]], another vasoconstrictor. [[Tobacco]] leaf is often added to the mixture, thereby adding the effect of [[nicotine]].&lt;ref name="WHO_citing_IARC" /&gt;

In parts of [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], and southern [[China]], areca nuts are not only chewed along with betel leaf, but are also used in the preparation of [[Ayurvedic Medicine|Ayurvedic]] and [[Chinese herbology|traditional Chinese medicines]]. Powdered areca nut is used as a constituent in some [[dentifrice]]s.&lt;ref name=Bhat&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bhat | first1 = R. | last2 = Ganachari | first2 = S. | last3 = Deshpande | first3 = R. | last4 = Ravindra | first4 = G. | last5 = Venkataraman | first5 = A. | title = Rapid Biosynthesis of Silver Nanoparticles Using Areca Nut (Areca catechu) Extract Under Microwave-Assistance | doi = 10.1007/s10876-012-0519-2 | journal = Journal of Cluster Science | volume = 24 | pages = 107 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other traditional uses include the removal of [[tapeworm]]s and other [[intestinal parasite]]s by swallowing a few teaspoons of powdered areca nut, drunk as a [[decoction]], or by taking tablets containing the extracted alkaloids.&lt;ref name=Bhat/&gt; According to traditional Ayurvedic medicine, chewing areca nut and betel leaf is a good remedy against [[halitosis|bad breath]].&lt;ref&gt;Naveen Pattnaik, ''The Tree of Life''&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2013}} Diplomat [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]] noted that Chinese people would mix areca nut with ''[[Uncaria gambir]]'' during his visit to China in the 1830s.&lt;ref name=Roberts1&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Edmund|title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat|year=1837|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|location=New York|page=138|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/138/}}&lt;/ref&gt; After chewing a betelnut, the red residue is generally spat out and is considered an [[eyesore]]. This has led many places to ban chewing this nut. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[File:Arecanutconsum1.PNG|thumb|290px|Areca nut and betel leaf consumption in the world]]

Chewing the mixture of areca nut and betel leaf is a tradition, custom, or ritual which dates back thousands of years in much of the geographical areas from South Asia eastward to the Pacific. It constitutes an important and popular cultural activity in many [[Asia]]n and [[Oceania|Oceanic]] countries, including [[Pakistan]], the [[Maldives]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bhutan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Burma]] ([[Myanmar]]), [[China]], [[Laos]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Cambodia]], [[Culture of Vietnam|Vietnam]], [[Taiwan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Palau]], [[Yap]], [[Guam]], [[Papua New Guinea]], the [[Solomon Islands]], and [[Vanuatu]]. How or when the areca nut and the betel leaf were first combined into one psychoactive drug is not known. Archaeological evidence from Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines suggests they have been used in tandem for at least 4000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epistola.com/sfowler/scholar/scholar-betel.html |title=Archaeological evidence from Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines |publisher=Epistola.com |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vietnam, the areca nut and the betel leaf are such important symbols of love and marriage that in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] the phrase "matters of betel and areca" (''chuyện trầu cau'') is synonymous with marriage.  The tradition of chewing areca nuts starts the talk between the groom's parents and the bride's parents about the young couple's marriage. Therefore, the leaves and juices are used ceremonially in Vietnamese weddings. The folk tale explaining the origin of this Vietnamese tradition is a good illustration of the belief that the combination of areca nut and the betel leaf is ideal to the point they are practically inseparable, like an idealized married couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vietspring.org/legend/traucau.html |title=Vietnamese Legend |publisher=Vietspring.org |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paan60.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Display of the items usually included in a chewing session: The betel leaves are folded in different ways according to the country and most have a little [[calcium hydroxide]] daubed inside. Slices of the dry areca nut are on the upper left hand and slices of the tender areca nut on the upper right. The pouch on the lower right contains tobacco, a relatively recent introduction.]]

Malay culture and tradition hold betel nut and leaves in high esteem. Traditionally, guests who visit a Malay house are presented with a tray of areca nuts and betel leaves, in much the same way as drinks are offered to guests in many cultures around the world. There is even a Malay proverb about the betel nut, "''bagaikan pinang dibelah dua''", loosely translated ''like a betel nut cut in two'', referring to the similarity of two persons such as twins or siblings, because the two halves of the cut betel nut are very similar to each other.

In the Indian subcontinent, the chewing of betel and areca nut dates back to the pre-[[Vedic period]] [[Harappa]]n empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_883_2004-12-17.html |title=Betel chewing |work=Singapore Infopedia |publisher=National Library Singapore |date=May 5, 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015222435/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_883_2004-12-17.html |archivedate=October 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly, in both India and Sri Lanka, it was a custom of the royalty to chew areca nut with betel leaf. Kings had special attendants whose duty it was to carry a box with all the necessary ingredients for a good chewing session. There was also a custom for lovers to chew areca nut and betel leaf together, because of its breath-freshening and relaxant properties. A sexual symbolism thus became attached to the chewing of the nut and the leaf. The areca nut represented the male principle, and the betel leaf the female principle. Considered an auspicious ingredient in [[Hinduism]] and some schools of [[Buddhism]], the areca nut is still used along with betel leaf in religious ceremonies, and also while honoring individuals in much of southern Asia.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In [[Assam]], it is a tradition to offer ''pan-tamul'' (betel leaves and raw areca nut) to guests, after tea or meals, served in a brass plate with stands called  ''bota''. Among the Assamese, the areca nut also has a variety of uses during religious and marriage ceremonies, where it has the role of a fertility symbol.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} A tradition from Upper Assam is to invite guests to wedding receptions by offering a few areca nuts with betel leaves. During [[Bihu]], the ''husori'' players are offered areca nuts and betel leaves by each household while their blessings are solicited.

Spanish mariner [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira|Álvaro de Mendaña]] reported observing [[Solomon Islands|Solomon Islanders]] chewing the nut and the leaf with caustic lime, and the manner in which the habit stained their mouths red. He noted the friendly and genial chief Malope, on [[Santa Isabel Island]], would offer him the combination as a token of friendship every time they met.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Robert (1984), Las islas de la imprudencia, Barcelona: Edhasa. {{ISBN|84-350-0430-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bhutan, the areca nut is called ''doma''. The raw areca nut, which is soft and moist, is very potent and when chewed can cause palpitation and [[vasoconstriction]]. This form is eaten in the lower regions of Bhutan and in North Bengal, where the nut is cut into half and put into a local ''paan'' leaf with a generous amount of lime. In the rest of Bhutan the raw nut, with the husk on, is fermented such that the husk rots and is easy to extract. The fermented doma has a putrid odour, which can be smelled from miles.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Traditionally, this fragrant nut is cut in half and placed on top of a cone made of local betel leaf, which has a dash of lime put into it. "Myth has it that the inhabitants of Bhutan traditionally known as Monyul, the land of Monpas where Buddhism did not reach lived on raw flesh, drank blood, and chewed bones. After the arrival of Guru Rinpoche in the 8th century, he stopped the people from eating flesh and drinking blood and created a substitute which is betel leaf, lime and areca nut. Today, chewing doma has become a custom. Doma is served after meals, during rituals and ceremonies. It is offered to friends and is chewed at work places by all sections of the society and has become an essential part of Bhutanese life and culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhutan2008.bt/en/node/298 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409091824/http://www.bhutan2008.bt/en/node/298 |archivedate=2012-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The addition of tobacco leaf to the chewing mixture is a relatively recent innovation, as tobacco was not introduced from the American continent until the colonial era.

Areca nut affects almost all organs of the human body, including the brain, heart, lungs, [[gastrointestinal tract]] and reproductive organs. It causes or aggravates pre-existing conditions such as [[neuronal]] injury, [[myocardial infarction]], [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s, [[hepatotoxicity]], asthma, central obesity, [[type II diabetes]], [[hyperlipidemia]], [[metabolic syndrome]], etc. Areca nut affects the [[endocrine system]], leading to [[hypothyroidism]], [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia|prostate hyperplasia]] and [[infertility]]. It affects the immune system leading to suppression of [[T-cell]] activity and decreased release of [[cytokines]]. It has harmful effects on the [[fetus]] when used during pregnancy.}}

In 2003 the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC), a World Health Organization sponsored group, found sufficient evidence that the habit of chewing betel quid, with or without tobacco, causes cancer in humans.&lt;ref name=WHO_citing_IARC&gt;{{cite web |title=IARC Monographs Programme finds betel-quid and areca-nut chewing carcinogenic to humans |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2003 |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/priarc/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn_9789283212850"&gt;{{cite book |author=International Agency for Research on Cancer |authorlink=International Agency for Research on Cancer |title=Betel-quid and areca-nut chewing.

In October, 2009, 30 scientists from 10 countries met at IARC to reassess the carcinogenicity of various agents including areca nut, and mechanisms of carcinogenesis. They confirmed there is sufficient evidence that areca nut, with or without tobacco, can cause cancer.&lt;ref&gt;See table for Group 1 carcinogen agents in {{cite journal |author= Beatrice Secretan|year= 2009|title= A review of human carcinogens|journal= The Lancet Oncology|volume= 10|issue= 11|pages= 1033–1034|doi= 10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70326-2|url= http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS1470204509703262/table?tableid=tbl1&amp;tableidtype=table_id&amp;sectionType=lightBlue|pmid=19891056|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The harm caused by consumption of betel quid or areca nut by hundreds of millions of people worldwide (mainly with southern and eastern Asian origins and connections) has been characterized as a "neglected global [[public health]] emergency".&lt;ref name=Mehrtash-2017&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mehrtash H, Duncan K, Parascandola M, David A, Gritz ER, Gupta PC, Mehrotra R, Amer Nordin AS, Pearlman PC, Warnakulasuriya S, Wen CP, Zain RB, Trimble EL |title=Defining a global research and policy agenda for betel quid and areca nut |journal=Lancet Oncol. |volume=18 |issue=12 |pages=e767–e775 |date=December 2017 |pmid=29208442 |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(17)30460-6 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Prakash_Gupta9/publication/321457219_Defining_a_global_research_and_policy_agenda_for_betel_quid_and_areca_nut/links/5a24e68fa6fdcc8e8668fd4f/Defining-a-global-research-and-policy-agenda-for-betel-quid-and-areca-nut.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern-day consumption ==
[[File:Eating Pinang prohibited.jpg|thumb|Sign in [[Indonesia]] saying that chewing betelnut is prohibited. Because of the mess, many places ban chewing betelnut. Notably, [[Port Moresby]], the capital of [[Papua New Guinea]], has a ban on buai. This buai ban is from Sentani Airport, Jayapura, Papua Province, Indonesia.]]
[[File:Spit from chewing Areca nut 02.JPG|thumb|Chewing betelnut produces a red residue which is spat out. It is often considered an eyesore.]]
In [[India]] (the largest consumer of areca nut) and [[Pakistan]], the preparation of nut with or without betel leaf is commonly referred to as ''[[paan]]''. It is available practically everywhere and is sold in ready-to-chew pouches called ''pan masala'' or ''supari'', as a mixture of many flavours whose primary base is areca nut crushed into small pieces. Poor people, who may eat only every other day, use it to stave off [[hunger pangs]].&lt;ref name=Javed-2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Collingham2006&gt;{{cite book| last=Collingham| first=Lizzie | title=Curry: A Tale of Cooks and Conquerors| year=2006| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=Oxford| isbn=978-0-19-988381-3|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pan masala'' with a small quantity of tobacco is called ''[[gutka]]''. The easily discarded, small plastic ''supari'' or ''gutka'' pouches are an ubiquitous pollutant of the South Asian environment. Some of the liquid in the mouth is usually disposed of by spitting, producing bright red spots wherever the expectorate lands.
[[File:Paan Making.jpg|thumb|left|Shopkeeper making ''paan'' in an Indian store]]

In the [[Maldives]], areca nut chewing is very popular, but spitting is frowned upon and regarded as an unrefined, repulsive way of chewing. Usually, people prefer to chew thin slices of the dry nut, which is sometimes roasted. ''Kili'', a mixture of areca nut, betel, cloves, cardamom and sugar is sold in small home-made paper pouches. Old people who have lost their teeth keep "chewing" by pounding the mixture of areca nut and betel with a small mortar and pestle.

In [[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Solomon Islands]], fresh areca nut, betel leaf or 'fruit leaf' (''daka'' in PNG) and lime are sold on street corners.  In these countries, dried or flavoured areca nut is not popular.  Betelnuts there are referred to in [[Tok Pisin]] as buai. There has recently been a controversial ban on selling and chewing betelnut in public places [[Port Moresby]]. Because of this, many people have tried to smuggle betelnut into Port Moresby. Notably, there was a raid in [[Hanuabada]] in May 2015 where several bags of betelnut were confiscated, the total value of the confiscated nuts exceeding $180,000 USD. Areca nut chewing has recently been introduced into [[Vanuatu]], where it is growing in popularity, especially in the northern islands of the country.
In [[Guam]] and the neighboring [[Northern Mariana Islands]], betel and areca nut chewing is a social pastime as a means to extend friendship, and can be found in many, if not most, large gatherings as part of the food display.

In [[Palau]], betel nut is chewed with lime, piper leaf and nowadays, with the addition of tobacco. Older and younger generations alike enjoy the use of betel nut, which is readily available at stores and markets. Unlike in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, where the inner areca nut is used, in [[Palau]], the areca nut's skin is chewed along with lime, leaf and tobacco and the juice is not swallowed but spat out.

In [[Taiwan]], bags of 20 to 40 areca nuts are purchased fresh daily by a large number of consumers. To meet the steady year-round demand, two kinds of betel-nut shops sell betel and nuts, as well as cigarettes and drinks, including beer: Small [[mom and pop shop]]s, often poorly maintained and with unassuming façades, and shops which will often consist of nothing more than a single, free-standing room, or booth. The latter is usually elevated one meter above the street, and measures less than 3 by 2 m. Large picture windows comprise two or more of the walls, allowing those who pass by a complete view of the interior. The interior is often painted brightly. Within such a shop, a [[sexily]] dressed young woman, a "[[betel nut beauty]]", can be seen preparing betel and areca nuts. Shops are often identified by multicoloured (commonly green) [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent tubes]] or [[neon light]]s that frame the windows or that are arranged radially above a store. Customers stop on the side of the road and wait for the girls to bring their betel and areca nut to their vehicles. The habit of chewing betel nut is often associated with blue-collar labor industries such a long-haul transportation, construction, or fishing. Workers in these labor-intensive industries use betel nut for its stimulating effect, but it also becomes a tool for socializing with coworkers. For example, studies have shown chewing betel nut is prevalent among taxi, bus and truck drivers, who rely on the stimulating effect of betel nut to cope with long work hours.&lt;ref&gt;Chuang CY, Chang CH, Chang CC.

In [[Hainan]] and [[Hunan Province]], China, where [[Xiangtan]] is a center of use and processing,&lt;ref name = "binglang" &gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/world/asia/20hunan.html "Despite Risks, an Addictive Treat Fuels a Chinese City"] article by Dan Levin in ''[[The New York Times]]'' August 19, 2010, accessed August 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; a wide range of old and young people consume areca nut daily. Most, though, consume the dried variety of the nut by itself, without the betel leaves. Some people also consume the areca nut in its raw, fresh form with or without the betel leaves. Betel nuts are sold mostly by old women walking around trying to sell it, but the dried version can be found in most shops which sell tea, alcohol and cigarettes.

In Thailand, the consumption of areca nut has declined gradually in the last decades. The younger generation rarely chews the substance, especially in the cities. Most of the present-day consumption is confined to older generations, mostly people above 50. Even so, small trays of betel leaves and sliced tender areca nut are sold in markets and used as offerings in Buddhist shrines.

In Australia, the sale of areca nut is prohibited. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Banned substance Betel Nut readily available for sale in Australia |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/yourlanguage/punjabi/en/article/2016/10/26/banned-substance-betel-nut-readily-available-sale-australia |website=SBS.com.au |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippines, chewing the areca nut and betel leaf was a very widespread tradition in the past. Now, though, this tradition is almost dead among the urban people in the cities and big towns, and has largely been replaced by gum and tobacco. Nowadays, older people are the only ones chewing betel nuts. But in rural areas, betel nut-chewing is very much alive.
[[File:Areca nuts in China 01.jpg|thumb|150px|Areca nuts as sold in [[Hainan]], China]]
In the United States, areca nut is not a controlled or specially taxed substance and may be found in some Asian grocery stores. However, importation of areca nut in a form other than whole or carved kernels of nuts can be stopped at the discretion of US Customs officers on the grounds of food, agricultural, or medicinal drug violations. Such actions by Customs are very rare.
In the [[United Kingdom]], areca nut is readily available in Asian grocery stores and even in shredded forms from the World Food aisles of larger [[Tesco]] supermarkets.

Possession of betel nut or leaf is banned in the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] and is a punishable offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dubai.ae/en/Lists/HowToGuide/DispForm.aspx?ID=6|title=Avoid bringing banned items into the UAE|website=www.dubai.ae|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Autodidacticism''' (also '''autodidactism''') or '''self-education''' (also '''self-learning''' and '''self-teaching''') is [[education]] without the guidance of masters  (such as [[teacher]]s and [[professor]]s) or [[educational institution|institutions]] (such as schools). Generally, an autodidact is an individual who chooses the subject they will study, their studying material, and the studying rhythm and time. An autodidact may or may not have [[formal education]], and their study may be either a complement or an alternative to it. Many [[List of notable autodidacts|notable contributions]] have been made by autodidacts.

== Etymology ==
The term has its roots in the [[Ancient Greek]] words {{lang|grc|[[wikt:αὐτός|αὐτός]]}} ({{transl|grc|autós}}, {{Literal translation|'self'|lk=on}}) and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:διδακτικός|διδακτικός]]}} ({{transl|grc|didaktikos}}, {{Literal translation|'teaching'}}). The related term ''[[didacticism]]'' defines an artistic [[philosophy of education]].

== Terminology ==
Various terms are used to describe self-education. One such is ''heutagogy'', coined in 2000 by Stewart Hase and Chris Kenyon of [[Southern Cross University]] in Australia; others are ''self-directed learning'' and ''self-determined learning''. In the heutagogy paradigm, a learner should be at the centre of their own learning.&lt;ref name= ChapnickMeloy&gt;{{cite book|title=Renaissance elearning: creating dramatic and unconventional learning experiences|series=Essential resources for training and HR professionals|author1=Samantha Chapnick  |author2=Jimm Meloy |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|date=2005|isbn=9780787971472|pages=36&amp;ndash;37|chapter=From Andragogy to Heutagogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern education==
Autodidacticism is sometimes a complement of modern education.&lt;ref&gt;"University lecturers do not guide their students' learning to the same extent; they do not organise their students' private study (no more set homework!); nor do they filter knowledge for you in the same way. There are two reasons for this. The first reason is that you are expected to be independent, capable of organising your life, your time, your studies and your learning, so that when you graduate you are able to function successfully in your chosen profession". Extract from: ''The student's guide to learning at university'', by Geoffrey Cooper, published in 2003 Australia by TheHumanities.com, {{ISBN|1-86335-510-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a complement to education, students would be encouraged to do more independent work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=3459 |title=Natural Learning in Higher Education |author=J. Scott Armstrong |journal=Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning |year=2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028075300/https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public%3Amain.file&amp;fileID=3459 |archivedate=28 October 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Industrial Revolution]] created a new situation for self-directed learners.

Before the twentieth century, only a small minority of people received an advanced academic education. As stated by [[Joseph Whitworth]] in his influential report on industry dated from 1853, literacy rates were higher in the United States. However, even in the U.S., most children were not completing high school. High school education was necessary to become a teacher. In modern times, a larger percentage of those completing high school also attended college, usually to pursue a professional degree, such as law or medicine, or a divinity degree.&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009"/&gt;

For many professions or for personal knowledge, however, formal education is not so necessary today due to the easier availability of free information on the Internet. Whereas in the past, one of the main benefits of going to college was to gain access to their superior libraries, today access to facts and books is available online. Financial analyst and author [[Peter Schiff]], for one, says, "Never before in history has it been so easy to be self-educated".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT3wmLjPAQ0&amp;t=27m27s Radio interview with Peter Schiff], 9 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Collegiate teaching was based on the classics (Latin, philosophy, ancient history, theology) until the early nineteenth century. There were few if any institutions of higher learning offering studies in engineering or science before 1800. Institutions such as the [[Royal Society]] did much to promote scientific learning, including public lectures. In England, there were also itinerant lecturers offering their service, typically for a fee.&lt;ref name="Robinson and Musson"&gt;{{cite book

Prior to the nineteenth century, there were many important inventors working as millwrights or mechanics who had typically received an elementary education and served an apprenticeship.&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanics, instrument makers and surveyors had various mathematics training. [[James Watt]] was a surveyor and instrument maker and is described as being "largely self-educated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watt, like some other autodidacts of the time, became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] and a member of the [[Lunar Society]]. In the eighteenth century these societies often gave public lectures and were instrumental in teaching chemistry and other sciences with industrial applications which were neglected by traditional universities. Academies also arose to provide scientific and technical training.

Years of schooling in the United States began to increase sharply in the early twentieth century. This phenomenon was seemingly related to increasing mechanization displacing child labor. The automated glass bottle-making machine is said to have done more for education than child labor laws because boys were no longer needed to assist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the number of boys employed in this particular industry was not that large; it was mechanization in several sectors of industry that displaced child labor toward education. For males in the U.S. born 1886–90, years of school averaged 7.86, while for those born in 1926–30, years of school averaged 11.46.&lt;ref&gt;[http://129.3.20.41/eps/mac/papers/0502/0502021.pdf Two Centuries of American Macroeconomic Growth From Exploration of Resource Abundance to Knowledge Driven Development, pp 44] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723192618/http://129.3.20.41/eps/mac/papers/0502/0502021.pdf |date=23 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most recent trends in education is that the classroom environment should cater towards students' individual needs, goals, and interests. This model adopts the idea of [[inquiry-based learning]] where students are presented with scenarios to identify their own research, questions and knowledge regarding the area. As a form of [[discovery learning]], students in today's classrooms are being provided with more opportunity to "experience and interact" with knowledge, which has its roots in autodidacticism.

Successful self-teaching requires self-discipline and reflective capability. Some research suggests that being able to regulate one's own learning is something that must be modeled to students, for it is not a natural human tendency in the population at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iran-Nejad|first=Asghar|author2=Brad Chissom|title=Contributions of Active and Dynamic Self-Regulation to Learning|journal=Innovative Higher Education|year=1992|volume=17|issue=2|page=125|doi=10.1007/bf00917134}}&lt;/ref&gt; To interact with the environment, a framework has been identified to determine the components of any learning system: a reward function, incremental action value functions and action selection methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arentze|first=Theo|author2=Harry Timmermans|title=Modeling learning and adaptation processes in activity-travel choice: A framework and numerical experiment|journal=Transportation|year=2003|volume=30|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rewards work best in motivating learning when they are specifically chosen on an individual student basis. New knowledge must be incorporated into previously existing information as its value is to be assessed. Ultimately, these [[instructional scaffolding|scaffolding]] techniques, as described by [[Vygotsky]] (1978) and problem solving methods are a result of dynamic decision making.

The secular and modern societies gave foundations for a new system of education and a new kind of autodidacts. While the number of schools and students raised from one century to the other, so did the number of autodidacts. The industrial revolution produced new educational tools used in schools, universities and outside academic circles to create a post-modern era that gave birth to the World Wide Web and encyclopaedic data banks such as [[Wikipedia]]. As this concept becomes more widespread and popular, web locations like [[Udacity]] and [[Khan Academy]] are developed as learning centers for many people to actively and freely learn together. The [[Alliance for Self-Directed Education]] (ASDE) is also formed to publicize and provide guidance or support for self-directed education.

==In history, philosophy, literature, and television==
{{No footnotes|section|date=February 2012}}
The first philosophical claim supporting an autodidactic program to the study of nature and God was in the philosophical novel ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (Alive Son of the Vigilant), whose titular hero is considered the archetypal autodidact.&lt;ref name="ben-zaken"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story is a medieval autodidactic utopia, a philosophical treatise in a literary form, which was written by the Andalusian philosopher [[Ibn Tufail]] in the 1160s in Marrakesh. It is a story about a feral boy, an autodidact prodigy who masters nature through instruments and reason, discovers laws of nature by practical exploration and experiments, and gains ''[[summum bonum]]'' through a mystical mediation and communion with God. The hero rises from his initial state of ''[[tabula rasa]]'' to a mystical or direct experience of God after passing through the necessary natural experiences. The focal point of the story is that human reason, unaided by society and its conventions or by religion, can achieve scientific knowledge, preparing the way to the mystical or highest form of human knowledge.

Commonly translated as "The Self-Taught Philosopher" or "The Improvement of Human Reason", Ibn-Tufayl's story Hayy Ibn-Yaqzan inspired debates about autodidacticism in a range of historical fields from classical Islamic philosophy through Renaissance humanism and the European Enlightenment. In his book ''Reading Hayy Ibn-Yaqzan: a Cross-Cultural History of Autodidacticism,'' Avner Ben-Zaken showed how the text traveled from late medieval Andalusia to early modern Europe and demonstrated the intricate ways in which autodidacticism was contested in and adapted to diverse cultural settings.

&lt;ref name="ben-zaken" /&gt; Autodidacticism apparently intertwined with struggles over Sufism in twelfth-century Marrakesh; controversies about the role of philosophy in pedagogy in fourteenth-century Barcelona; quarrels concerning astrology in Renaissance Florence in which Pico della Mirandola pleads for autodidacticism against the strong authority of intellectual establishment notions of predestination; and debates pertaining to experimentalism in seventeenth-century Oxford. Pleas for autodidacticism echoed not only within close philosophical discussions; they surfaced in struggles for control between individuals and establishments.&lt;ref name="ben-zaken" /&gt;

In the story of African American self-education, Heather Andrea Williams presents a historical account to examine African American's relationship to literacy during [[slavery]], the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and the first decades of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=H.A.|title=Self-taught: African American Education in slavery and freedom|year=2005|publisher=University of North Carolina Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the personal accounts tell of individuals who have had to teach themselves due to [[racial discrimination]] in education.

The [[working-class]] protagonist of [[Jack London's]] ''[[Martin Eden]]'' (1909) embarks on a path of self-learning to win the affections of Ruth, a member of cultured society. By the end of the novel, Eden has surpassed the intellect of the bourgeois class, leading him to a state of indifference and ultimately suicide.

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Nausea (Book)|Nausea]]'' (1938) depicts, as a secondary character, an autodidact.

Comic-book superhero [[Batman]] is frequently depicted as an autodidactic polymath who has acquired a vast range of skills over the years either by various trainers or having trained himself, and his expertise in various disciplines is virtually unmatched in the DC comics universe.

In ''[[The Ignorant Schoolmaster]]'' (1987), [[Jacques Rancière]] describes the emancipatory education of [[Joseph Jacotot]], a post-Revolutionary [[philosopher]] of education who discovered that he could teach things he did not know. The book is both a history and a contemporary intervention in the philosophy and politics of education, through the concept of autodidacticism; Rancière chronicles Jacotot's "adventures", but he articulates Jacotot's theory of "emancipation" and "stultification" in the present tense.

The 1997 drama film ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' follows the story of autodidact Will Hunting, played by [[Matt Damon]]. Hunting demonstrates his breadth and depth of knowledge throughout the film but especially to his therapist and in a heated discussion in a [[Harvard]] bar.

One of the main characters in ''[[The Elegance of the Hedgehog]]'' (2006), by [[Muriel Barbery]], is an autodidact. The story is told from the viewpoint of Renee, a middle-aged autodidact concierge in a Paris upscale apartment house and Paloma, a 12-year-old daughter of one of the tenants who is unhappy with her life. These two people find they have much in common when they both befriend a new tenant, Mr. Ozu, and their lives change forever.

In the Hindu epic, the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', ''[[Ekalavya]]'' is depicted as a tribal boy who was denied education in the science of arms from royal teachers from the house of Kuru. Ekalavya went to the forest, where he taught himself archery in front of an image of the Kuru teacher, Drona, that he had built for himself. Later, when the royal family found that Ekalavya had practiced with the image of Drona as his teacher, Drona asked for Ekalavya's thumb as part of his tuition. Ekalavya complied with Drona's request, thus ending his martial career.

In ''[[Suits (U.S. TV series)|Suits]]'', the protagonist (Mike Ross) possesses a highly competent knowledge of the law despite not receiving any formal education in any law school. His knowledge is attributable to both his affinity for reading (autodidacticism), in addition to his ''[[eidetic memory]]''.

Dr. Spencer Reid in ''Criminal Minds'', played by Matthew Gray Gubler, is an autodidact with an eidetic memory.

==In architecture==
[[Image:Tadao Ando 2004.jpg|thumb|[[Tadao Ando]] is a famous autodidact architect of the twenty-first century]]
Many successful and influential [[architect]]s, such as [[Mies Van Der Rohe]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Violet-le-Duc|Violet-Le-Duc]], and [[Tadao Ando]] were self-taught.

There are very few countries allowing autodidacticism in [[architecture]] today. The practice of architecture or the use of the title "architect", are now [[Professional requirements for architects|protected in most countries]].

Self-taught architects have generally studied and qualified in other fields such as [[engineering]] or [[handicraft|arts and crafts]]. [[Jean Prouvé]] was first a structural engineer. [[Le Corbusier]] had an academic qualification in decorative arts. [[Tadao Ando]] started his career as a draftsman, and [[Eileen Gray]] studied [[fine arts]].

When a [[political state]] starts to implement restrictions on the profession, there are issues related to the rights of established self-taught architects. In most countries the legislation includes a [[grandfather clause]], authorising established self-taught architects to continue practicing. In the UK, the legislation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaruk.info/Legislation/Act31.PDF Architects (Registration) Act 1931] (UK)&lt;/ref&gt; allowed self-trained architects with 2 years of experience to register. In France,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=606CAD25CBEA6D17169D0D5D82D5C464.tpdjo14v_1?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000522423&amp;dateTexte=19770104&amp;categorieLien=id#JORFTEXT000000522423 Loi n°77-2 du 3 janvier 1977 sur l'architecture] (Architects Act in France)&lt;/ref&gt; it allowed self-trained architects with 5 years of experience to register. In Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordredesarchitectes.be/fr/textes/juridique/loi_du_20_fevrier_1939.htm Loi du 20 fevrier 1939] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226220737/http://www.ordredesarchitectes.be/fr/textes/juridique/loi_du_20_fevrier_1939.htm |date=26 December 2010 }} (Architects Act in Belgium)&lt;/ref&gt; the law allowed experienced self-trained architects in practice to register. In Italy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordinearchitetti.fi.it/writable/Documenti/Conoscere%20l'ordine/A3/COMPETENZE/A3_1-12%20RD%2024-06-1923%20n.1395.pdf legge 24 june 1923 No. 1395] (Architects Act in Italy)&lt;/ref&gt; it allowed self-trained architects with 10 years of experience to register. In The Netherlands, the "''wet op de architectentitel van 7 juli 1987''" along with additional procedures, allowed architects with 10 years of experience and architects aged 40 years old or over, with 5 years of experience, to access the register.&lt;ref&gt;Refer to document on the Dutch Registration System drafted after a meeting between the General Secretary and Dr. Hans Groenevald, Director of the Stichting Bureau Architectenreglster, (SBA) in the Hague on 1 October 1993. 1 October 1993 is a significant date because on that day the protection of the title "architect" came into force in the Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other [[sovereign states]] chose to omit such a clause, and many established and competent practitioners were stripped of their professional rights.&lt;ref&gt;Refer to the example of the Republic of Ireland, where hundreds of professionally trained architects oppose new legislation that would prevent them from practicing. See [https://www.webcitation.org/5xRi740Mn?url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/ENJ/2010/05/18/00005.asp Parliamentary records] for more information.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Republic of Ireland, a group named "[[Architects' Alliance of Ireland]]" is defending the interests of long-established self-trained architects&lt;ref&gt;You can access more information from [http://www.architectsalliance.ie/ AAoI website]&lt;/ref&gt; who were recently deprived from their rights to practice as per Part 3 of the Irish Building Control Act 2007.&lt;ref&gt;For more information, you can access the full text from the Irish [http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2007/a2107.pdf Building Control Act 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical research such as "''Architecture of Change, Sustainability and Humanity in the Built Environment''"&lt;ref&gt;''Architecture of Change, Sustainability and Humanity in the Built Environment'', Editors: Kristin Feireiss, Lukas Feireiss, {{ISBN|978-3-89955-211-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or older studies like "[[Toward an Architecture|Vers une Architecture]]" from [[Le Corbusier]] describe the practice of architecture as an environment changing with new technologies, sciences, and legislation. All architects must be autodidacts to keep up to date with new [[Technical standard|standards]],  [[regulations]], or [[Methodology|methods]].

Self-taught architects like [[Eileen Gray]], [[Luis Barragán]], and many others, created a system where working is also learning, where self-education is associated with creativity and productivity within a working environment.

While he was primarily interested in [[naval architecture]], [[William Francis Gibbs]] learned his profession through his own study of [[battleship]]s and [[ocean liner]]s. Through his life he could be seen examining and changing the designs of ships that were already built, that is, until he started his firm [[Gibbs and Cox]].

==Future role==
The role of self-directed learning continues to be investigated in learning approaches, along with other important goals of education, such as content knowledge, epistemic practices and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hmelo-Silver|first=C.E. |author2=R.G. Duncan |author3=C.A Chinn|title=Scaffolding and achievement in problem-based and inquiry learning: A response to Krischner, Sweller and Clark|journal=Educational Psychologist|year=2007|volume=42|issue=2|page=99|doi=10.1080/00461520701263368}}&lt;/ref&gt; As colleges and universities offer [[distance learning]] degree programs and secondary schools provide [[cyber school]] options for K-12 students, technology provides numerous resources that enable individuals to have a self-directed learning experience. Several studies show these programs function most effectively when the "teacher" or facilitator is a full owner of virtual space to encourage a broad range of experiences to come together in an online format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barab|first=S.A. |author2=J.G. MaKinster |author3=J.A. Moore |author4=D.J.

Furthermore, [[massive open online course]]s (MOOCs) make autodidacticism easier and thus more common.

A 2016 [[Stack Overflow]] poll&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016 | title=Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2016 | accessdate=Nov 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that due to the rise of autodidacticism, 69.1% of [[software developer]]s appear to be self-taught.

      <comment>Contrary to the original text, the black stone may not mentioned in the Quran but it is mentioned many, many, many times in hadiths (i.e. Tirmidhi 2:4:788) and is deeply venerated therein. It was recorded that Muhammad use to circle around it, point at it and yell "allahu akbar" (Sahih Bukhari 2:26:682). He said on the day of judgement it will grow a mouth and tongue and testify to those who touched it and asked for forgiveness (Jami at-Tirmidhi 2:4:961), hence why Muslims do this during Hajj.</comment>

'''Baetylus''' (also '''Baetyl''', '''Bethel''', or '''Betyl''', from [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] ''bet [[El (deity)|el]]'' "house of god") is a word denoting sacred stones that were supposedly endowed with life. According to ancient sources, these objects of worship were [[meteorite]]s, which were dedicated to the gods or revered as symbols of the gods themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}} cites [[Natural History (Pliny)|Pliny's ''Natural History'']] xvii. 9; [[Photios I of Constantinople]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Myriobiblon]]'', Codex 242.&lt;/ref&gt; A baetyl is also mentioned in the [[Bible]] at [[Bethel]] in the [[Book of Genesis]] in the story of [[Jacob's Ladder]].{{sfn|Palmer|1997|p=99}}

In the [[Phoenicia]]n mythology related by [[Sanchuniathon]], one of the sons of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] was named ''[[Bethel (god)|Baetylus]]''.&lt;ref name="Chisholm"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Baetylus|volume=3|pages=191-192}} This has further references:
*[[Friedrich Münter]], ''Über die vom Himmel gefallenen Steine'' (1805).
*Bösigk, ''De Baetyliis'' (1854).
*the exhaustive article by [[François Lenormant]] in [[Charles Victor Daremberg]] and [[Edmond Saglio]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire des Antiquités Grecques et Romaines]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The worship of baetyls was widespread in the Phoenician colonies, including [[Carthage]], even after the adoption of [[Christianity]], and was denounced by [[Augustine of Hippo]].

In [[ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]], the term was specially applied to the [[Omphalos]],{{sfn|Doniger|2000|p=106}} the stone supposed to have been swallowed by [[Cronus]] (who feared misfortune from his own children) in mistake for his infant son [[Zeus]], for whom it had been substituted by [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}} cites ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'', s.v.&lt;/ref&gt; This stone was carefully preserved at [[Delphi]], anointed with oil every day and on festive occasions covered with raw wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}} cites [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] X. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rome]], there was the stone effigy of [[Cybele]], called ''Mater Idaea Deum'', that had been ceremoniously brought from [[Pessinus]] in Asia Minor in 204 BC.&lt;ref name="Chisholm"/&gt; Another conical meteorite was enshrined in the [[Elagabalium]] to personify the Syrian deity [[Elagabalus (deity)|Elagabalus]].

In some cases an attempt was made to give a more regular form to the original shapeless stone: thus [[Agyieus|Apollo Agyieus]] was represented by a conical [[column|pillar]] with a pointed end, [[Meilichios|Zeus Meilichius]] in the form of a [[pyramid]]. Other famous baetylic idols were those in the temples of Zeus Casius at [[Samandağ|Seleucia Pieria]], and of Zeus Teleios at [[Tegea]]. Even in the declining years of [[paganism]], these idols still retained their significance, as is shown by the attacks upon them by ecclesiastical writers.&lt;ref name="Chisholm"/&gt;

A similar practice survives today with the [[Kaaba]]'s [[Black Stone]], which was worshiped by pre-Islamic polytheists. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Pagans worshiped the Kaaba and the black stone" - Ibn Ishaq, The life of Muhammad|last=Ibn|first=Ishaq|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Arabs worship Stones" - Clement of Alexandria|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Bart on the Road'''" is the twentieth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on March 31, 1996. In the episode, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] makes his own [[Identity document forgery|fake driver's license]]. He rents a car with it and takes [[Milhouse]], [[Martin Prince|Martin]], and [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson]] on a [[road trip]] to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. In Knoxville, however, the car is destroyed, and they are stranded without any money or transportation. To get Bart home, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] orders equipment for the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant|power plant]] and ships it via [[courier]] from Knoxville, with the boys stowed away inside the crate.

The episode was written by [[Richard Appel]], and directed by [[Swinton O. Scott III]]. The idea of a road trip was "so exciting" that the writers immediately knew they wanted to write it. The episode features cultural references to the 1991 film ''[[Naked Lunch (film)|Naked Lunch]]'', American singer [[Andy Williams]], and ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine. Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics; ''[[Central Michigan Life]]'' named it the eighth-best episode of the series. It acquired a [[Nielsen rating]] of 7.2, and was the fifth-highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.

==Plot==	
[[Principal Skinner]] sends the students of Springfield Elementary on a "[[Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Day|go to work with your parents day]]". Bart is forced to go to the [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] with his aunts [[Patty and Selma]], and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] goes to the nuclear power plant with [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]. At the DMV, Bart makes himself a [[Identity document forgery|fake driver's license]], which he, Nelson, Martin, and Milhouse use to rent a car.

The boys tell their parents they are going to attend the National Grammar Rodeo in Canada, but secretly take the rented car for a road trip to the [[1982 World's Fair|World's Fair]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. In Knoxville, however, they discover that the fair was held fourteen years earlier. The boys' car soon gets destroyed, and they are left stranded.

Bart places a collect call to Lisa, who has spent the entire spring break with Homer at work, to ask her for advice. Lisa obtains Homer's promise that he will not get upset and she reveals Bart's predicament. To get Bart home, Homer orders equipment for the power plant and ships it via courier from Knoxville, with the boys stowed away inside the crate and Bart as the courier.

==Production==
[[File:102_0459.JPG|thumb|The writers decided that the characters would go to a "funny unlikely place", the [[Sunsphere]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]]]
The episode was written by [[Richard Appel]],&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; who wanted to do an episode that had two things; a "go to work with your parents day" and Bart getting a driver's license. The "go to work with your parents day" idea appealed to Appel because it was something he "lost the right" to do when he went from [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] to [[private school]] as a child. Appel considered those days to be his favorites because he "didn't have to do anything" at his parents' job. The idea of having a driver's license was something that Appel dreamed about when he was younger.&lt;ref name="Appel"&gt;{{cite video |people=Appel, Richard |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Bart on the Road" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writing staff had never done a spring break episode before so they thought, "What would Lisa and Bart do on spring break?" and came up with the road trip plot. [[Bill Oakley]], the [[show runner]] of ''The Simpsons'' at the time, said that road trips were something that the writers liked to write stories about. The idea of four children going on a road trip was "so exciting" that they immediately knew they wanted to write it. There was a debate over where the children would go, and [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], was first suggested, but the writers eventually decided to have them go to a "funny unlikely place".&lt;ref name="Oakley"&gt;{{cite video |people=Oakley, Bill |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Bart on the Road" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oakley's show runner partner, [[Josh Weinstein]], said that the writers were always looking for combinations of characters that had not been done many times on the show. Homer and Lisa had not been done "too often" and they wanted the two characters to bond and get closer to each other.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"&gt;{{cite video |people=Weinstein, Josh |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Bart on the Road" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was directed by [[Swinton O. Scott III]].&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; It was difficult to animate because the animators had to draw completely new designs for the locations outside of Springfield, such as Knoxville. The car scenes were also difficult to animate. At the time, ''The Simpsons'' was using [[traditional animation]] without computers, but they had to get one for a scene where the camera spins around the car from above.&lt;ref name="Silverman"/&gt; The car was difficult to animate because it had to "look real" and not "boxy like a truck". The car was based on a 1993 [[Oldsmobile]] car with rounded edges.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"/&gt; ''The Simpsons'' animator [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] said that the episode was "probably the most difficult one" Scott had to direct on the show.&lt;ref name="Silverman"&gt;{{cite video |people=Silverman, David |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Bart on the Road" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, "Bart on the Road" finished 63rd in the ratings for the week of March 25 to March 31, 1996, with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 7.2.&lt;ref name=ratings&gt;{{cite news |title=Nielsen Ratings |date=April 4, 1996 |page=4 |work=[[The Tampa Tribune]] }} Retrieved on January 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was the fifth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]'', ''[[Party of Five]]'', ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]'', and ''[[Melrose Place]]''.&lt;ref name=ratings/&gt;

Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said that it "contains some superb touching character scenes between Homer and Lisa, a fascinating glimpse of Marge's insecurities, and some nice touches that take it above the show's very high average."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Dave Foster of DVD Times said that "Bart on the Road" is an episode which is built upon a "frankly ludicrous" idea which if the writers were to "stumble upon" now, "we'd simply see Bart happen upon a license and skip town without anyone noticing, but here they do give the setup a great deal of consideration both on and off the screen." He thought the story was "partly believable, though the opportunity when Bart hits the road is largely wasted with only a few well constructed jokes to speak of." Foster thinks, "what saves the episode is the opportunity to see Lisa and Homer connect, once again displaying what a strong season this is for Lisa as we see the two share some wonderfully tender moments, alongside some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2008-12-01 |url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=60554 |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season |publisher=DVD Times |date=2006-02-25 |author=Foster, Dave |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205013143/http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=60554 |archivedate=5 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that he "loves" the children's experiences at their parents' jobs, adding, "and when they head out of town, the fun continues.

'''''Cock''''' is a 2009 play by [[Mike Bartlett (playwright)|Mike Bartlett]]. It premiered at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in [[London]] in November 2011 and centres around John, a gay man who feels torn after meeting and falling in love with a woman.

==Plot==
John has identified as "gay" his entire life and has been in a relationship with his boyfriend "M" for the last 7 years, with whom he shares an apartment and a family life. After the couple decide to take a break, John meets a woman named "W" on his daily commute. He is surprised to find himself developing a physical attraction to her and decides to lose his heterosexual virginity and have sex with a woman for the first time. After identifying as a gay man for many years, John discovers that he enjoys sex with women. He now feels torn between his longtime boyfriend and his new female lover, as the newly discovered joys of vaginal sex cause his sexual identity as a gay man to be thrown into confusion. As "W" teaches John the ins-and-outs of heterosexual intercourse, the relationship becomes more serious and they began to consider getting married and having children together. Eventually, he confesses that he has slept with a woman, causing his boyfriend to be offended by the infidelity and disgusted that John has been cheating with a woman. John tells M that he loves him, but that sex is better with W ("her vagina is amazing") and that she's a more fitting partner for him ("She's better than you"). The play's final scene, which is meant to be reminiscent of a [[cock fight]], features John's boyfriend and John's girlfriend fighting over who will have him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.backstage.com/review/ny-theater/off-broadway/ny-review-cock/ |title=NY Review: 'Cock' |publisher=[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]] |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mycitypaper.com/Arts/Theater-review-Cock/ |title=Theater review: Cock |publisher=My City Paper |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2009/nov/27/cock-royal-court-theatre-space |title=A silent gesture means a thousand words on stage |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridatheateronstage.com/reviews/cock-takes-hard-look-at-nature-of-love-gablestage-production-rises-to-the-occasion/ |title=Cock Takes Hard Look At Nature of Love; GableStage Production Rises to the Occasion |publisher=Florida Theater on Stage |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production history==
The play premiered at the Royal Court Theatre, London, on November 13, 2011.

A production of the play was also put on at the Duke On 42nd Street, in New York City, in 2012.

The first major revival in the UK was commissioned by Chichester Festival Theatre in 2018 and played in the Minerva Theatre, directed by Kate Hewitt.

==Reception==
Michael Billington of ''The Guardian'' gave the play 3 stars out of 5, praising the play as a "sharp, witty study" that was less about "tortured bisexuality" and more about the "paralysing indecision that stems from not knowing who one really is." However, he notes that the play lacks social detail and character depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/nov/18/michael-billington-review |title=Cock |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alison Croggon, writing in ''The Guardian'', gave the play 4 stars out of 5, described ''Cock'' as a story of a gay man's discovery of "the unexpected pleasures of Cunt." She criticizes the play's "uncomfortable subtext of misogyny" and describes the plot as "farcical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/14/cock-melbourne-theatre-company-review |title=Cock, Melbourne Theatre Company – review |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Village Voice'', Alexis Solokis describes the play as a "visceral, funny, anguished" production that "pits boy against girl, cock against cunt." She likens the final dinner scene to a gladiator's ring or a boxing round that ends up being "less a battle of the sexes than a battle of sexual orientation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2012/05/23/cock-fight-club/ |title=Cock: Fight Club |publisher=The Village Voice |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for the ''Sydney Arts Guide'', Richard Cotter described the play as a "robust, ribald and bollocking production" about a gay man who becomes "cock shocked and cunt struck" due to a "newfound fondness for vaginal sex and a future view of breeding fecundity". He praised Bartlett's "crisp script" which he felt perfectly describes the sexual confusion of a "man child who has his cock and wants to eat it too." Cotter notes the sizzling tension between the female lover and the cuckolded boyfriend, which leads to the play's "shattering climax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyartsguide.com.au/cock-at-the-old-fitzroy/ |title=COCK @ THE OLD FITZ |publisher=Sydney Arts Guide |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gay City News'' credited the play for "tackling thorny issues rarely seen on stage". Instead of the standard [[coming out]] narrative of the supposedly straight man "succumbing to the power of cock, there's a supposedly gay guy with a boyfriend falling for pussy", a theme that is handled by Bartlett's script with "sensitivity and acerbic wit." The play is critiqued as "gimmicky", but the "surprisingly steamy" and "brilliantly staged" sex scene is praised for eliciting nervous laughter and shocked reactions in the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gaycitynews.nyc/cock-sure/ |title=Cock Sure |publisher=Gay City News |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Lifestyle Hub'' described the play as "a gay man's hilarious journey to heterosexual orgasm" that explores the "complexities of homosexuality." The play's "honest" and "straightforward" exploration of bisexuality shows that "Gay or not, people fall in love to those who can give us happiness." By presenting the story of a "bisexual gay" man who develops an attraction to the opposite sex, the play demonstrates the truth that "for some gays, they yearn for that happiness with other people regardless if they have vagina or... cock."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifestylehub.net/2014/02/red-turnip-theaters-cock-gay-mans.html |title=RED TURNIP THEATER'S 'COCK': A GAY MAN'S HILARIOUS JOURNEY TO HETEROSEXUAL ORGASM |publisher=The Lifestyle Hub |accessdate=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The play was banned in the local authority of [[Sotira, Famagusta|Sotira]], [[Cyprus]] for its gay content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2017/12/06/outburst-town-bans-performance-gay-play/ |title=Outburst after town bans performance of 'gay' play |publisher=[[Cyprus Mail]] |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Coco and Igor''''' is a 2002 novel by [[Chris Greenhalgh]]. Set mainly in Paris in 1920, it is based on a possible real-life affair between [[Coco Chanel]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].

==Plot summary==

Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' has its Paris premiere on 29 May 1913. Coco is mesmerised by the power of Igor's composition, but the audience is scandalised by its discordant, rhythmic music and [[Vaslav Nijinsky|Nijinsky's]] primitive choreography.

Coco finally meets Igor seven years later, at a dinner hosted by [[Sergei Diaghilev]], impresario of the [[Ballets Russes]]. Igor has been forced to flee Russia – with his wife and four children – following the Russian Revolution. Coco invites him to bring his family to stay with her at her villa in [[Garches]] – 'Bel Respiro'.

''[[wikt:couturière|Couturière]]'' and composer soon begin an affair. Both experience a surge of creativity; while Coco creates [[Chanel No. 5]] (with perfumer [[Ernest Beaux]]), Igor's compositions display a new, liberated style. But Igor's wife, Katerina, becomes ill with [[Tuberculosis|consumption]] and an unbearable tension takes hold of 'Bel Respiro' and its occupants.

==Structure==
The [[piano keyboard]] operates as a framework for the novel. There are eighty-eight chapters, corresponding to the number of keys on a piano.

==Film adaptation==
Greenhalgh adapted his novel for the 2009 film ''[[Coco Chanel &amp; Igor Stravinsky]]'', directed by [[Jan Kounen]] and starring [[Anna Mouglalis]] and [[Mads Mikkelsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23680620-details/Teacher+writes+finale+to+Cannes+in+school+hols/article.do |title=Teacher writes finale to Cannes in school hols |work=[[London Evening Standard]] |first=Olivia |last=Cole |date=24 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614234945/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23680620-details/Teacher%2Bwrites%2Bfinale%2Bto%2BCannes%2Bin%2Bschool%2Bhols/article.do |archivedate=14 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was selected to occupy the prestigious closing slot at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]] on 24 May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/10904957/year/2009.html |title=Coco Chanel &amp; Igor Stravinsky |accessdate=15 May 2009 |publisher=festival-cannes.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409033805/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/10904957/year/2009.html |archivedate=9 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Classical music riot|riotous premiere]] of ''The Rite of Spring'' at the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] on 29 May 1913 is legendary (see: [[The Rite of Spring#Premiere]]).

==Historical context==
In the spring of 1920, Chanel was introduced to Stravinsky by Sergei Diaghilev, impresario of the [[Ballets Russes]]. During the summer, Chanel discovered that the Stravinsky family was seeking a place to live. She invited them to "Bel Respiro" until they could find a more suitable residence (they arrived in the second week of September and stayed until May 1921). Chanel also guaranteed the 1920 Ballets Russes production of ''The Rite of Spring'' against financial loss with an anonymous gift to Diaghilev, said to be 300,000 francs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Stephen | last=Walsh | title=Stravinsky:  A Creative Spring | publisher= Alfred A. Knopf | year = 1999 | pages=318–319, 329 | isbn=0-679-41484-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The personal relationships depicted in the novel are largely fictionalised. Stravinsky was reputed to have been a philanderer who had several affairs, including one with Chanel. Whereas Stravinsky never publicly referred to this alleged affair, Chanel spoke about it at length to her biographer [[Paul Morand]] in 1946 (the conversation was published thirty years later as ''[[The Allure of Chanel|l'Allure de Chanel]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Morand | first=Paul | title=L'Allure de Chanel | date=1976 | publisher=Hermann | location=Paris | pages=121–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accuracy of Chanel's claims has been disputed both by Stravinsky's second wife, [[Vera Stravinsky|Vera]], and by his close musical collaborator, [[Robert Craft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Mary|title=Chanel, Stravinsky, and Musical Chic|journal=Fashion Theory|date=December 2006|volume= 10|issue= 4|pages=431–460 (p. 439)|doi=10.2752/136270406778664986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chanel|Chanel fashion house]] avers there is no evidence that any affair between Chanel and Stravinsky ever occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/ch/news/swiss-news/Fact_or_fiction-Chanel_Stravinsky-affair-curtains-Cannes--_52910.html Fact-or-fiction Chanel-Stravinsky affair curtains Cannes].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20740">{{Culture of Gibraltar}}
The '''culture of Gibraltar''' reflects [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarians]]' diverse origins. While there are [[Culture of Spain|Spanish]] and [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British]] influences, a result of the territory's status as a [[British overseas territory]] and its proximity to [[Spain]], the ethnic origins of most Gibraltarians are a mix of [[Andalusian people|Andalusian Spaniards]], [[Genoa|Genoese]], [[Maltese people|Maltese]],  [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[British people|British]]. The main religion is [[Christianity]], the majority group being the [[Roman Catholic Church]], then the [[Church of England]]. There is a long established [[Sephardic Jewish]] community, a number of [[Hindu]] [[India]]ns and a [[Moroccan people|Moroccan]] [[Muslim]] population. Gibraltarians of Genoese origin came to [[Rock of Gibraltar|The Rock]] in the 18th century, with the Maltese and Portuguese following in the 19th century, coming to work and trade in the British [[military base]]. Spanish Andalusian origins are the result of generations of intermarriage with inhabitants of surrounding towns.

During the [[Second World War]], the [[Evacuation of the Gibraltarian civilian population during World War II|whole civilian population of The Rock was evacuated]],&lt;ref name="tang"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bond | first=Peter | coauthors= | chapter=The Third Century 1904-2004 | year=2003 | month= | title=300 Years of British Gibraltar, 1704-2004  | publisher=Peter-Tan Publishing Co. | location=Gibraltar | isbn= | page= 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the interests of the British military, which decreed that "''the fortress comes first''". They were moved to the [[UK]], particularly to [[Fulham]] and [[Kensington]] in [[London]] and [[Ballymena]] in [[Northern Ireland]], as well as [[Jamaica]] and [[Madeira]]. This served to strengthen a Gibraltarian, as opposed to simply British, identity, and after the war, there was a successful campaign for repatriation.

==Cultural relationships with Britain and Spain==

===British Gibraltarians===
[[File:Gibraltar National Day 028 (9716508171) (2).jpg|thumb|left|Thousands of [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarians]] dress in their national colours of red and white and fill [[Grand Casemates Square]] during the 2013 [[Gibraltar National Day]] celebrations]]
Gibraltarians have historically been proud of their British heritage, and unlike the inhabitants of other territories, sought to strengthen, rather than loosen their ties with the UK and the [[British Crown]], seeing themselves as "more British than the British".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21668477 Are there places more British than the UK?], [[BBC News]], 8 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of being British was particularly strong when the [[History of Gibraltar#Second World War and after|frontier with Spain was closed]] in 1969, and all communications links were severed. Until 16 December 2006, the only flights from [[Gibraltar Airport]], were those to the UK. To some in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] itself, this sense of "pantomime [[Britishness]]" is often looked upon with a mixture of incomprehension and ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/1120514 True Brits], ''[[The Economist]]'', May 9th 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that they are largely of [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]] appearance and speak an [[Andalusian Spanish]] variant, known as ''[[Llanito]]'' gives Gibraltarians a strong resemblance to [[Andalusian people|Andalusian Spaniards]], despite the Gibraltarian's distinct cultural heritage and identity.

===Religion===
Most Gibraltarians are [[Roman Catholic]], with the [[Catholic Church in Gibraltar|Diocese of Gibraltar]] being directly responsible to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. The Rock also forms part of the [[Church of England]] diocese covering mainland [[Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe|Europe]], with a "[[Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe]]". There is also a [[Methodist Church]] and [[St Andrew's Church, Gibraltar|St Andrew's Church]] (part of the [[Church of Scotland]]).

There is a small (800 members) but very influential [[Jew]]ish minority, active in business and politics, and five [[synagogue]]s. Most [[Morocco|Moroccans]] are [[Muslim]], and there is a large [[mosque]] at [[Europa Point]], the [[Ibrahim-al-Ibrahim Mosque]], paid for by [[Saudi Arabia]]. Most [[India]]ns are [[Hindu]], with their own local temple.

Additionally there are two very active congregations of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] sharing the same [[Kingdom Hall]]; one has meetings in [[English language|English]] and the other in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

===Relations with Spain===
Historically, cultural ties with Spain have been strong; a variant of [[Andalusian Spanish]], "[[Llanito]]", being the [[vernacular]] language of the territory. Intermarriage between Gibraltarians and Spaniards resulted in many people having relatives on the other side of the frontier, known in Spanish as ''La Verja'' or 'the fence'. These people were badly affected by the closure of the frontier in 1969, which even saw telephone links severed, so that the only way that families could communicate was to shout across the border gates. Others took the more cumbersome and costly route of travelling first from Gibraltar to [[Tangiers]] by ferry and then taking another ferry to [[Algeciras]], before taking a final coach to [[La Línea de la Concepción]]. A journey that would take half a day, when the end destination would have been within walking distance under normal circumstances.

Since the frontier with Spain was reopened, ties with the hinterland, known as the "[[Campo de Gibraltar]]", have increased, with many buying property in places like [[La Línea de la Concepción]], [[Sotogrande]] and further afield like the [[Costa del Sol]], where prices are considerably lower. On the weekends, many flock across the frontier, with livelier nightclubs and bars than in Gibraltar. Younger Gibraltarians have considerable exposure to popular culture from Spain, and even ''vice versa'', the pop group "[[Taxi (Gibraltar band)|Taxi]]" having found success on the Spanish charts, virtually all of its songs being in Spanish. In addition, Gibraltarians of all ages are often avid supporters of Spanish [[football (soccer)|football]] teams like [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.]] as well as English teams such as [[Manchester United F.C.]] and [[Arsenal F.C.]].

However, the [[Gibraltar Football Association]]'s  application for membership of [[UEFA]], which would enable it to participate in the [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Football Championship]]s and the [[Football World Cup]],  has met with strong opposition from the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]].  This is seen as yet another attempt to deny the existence of Gibraltar internationally.

While Gibraltarians have multiple identities, seeing themselves to varying degrees as Gibraltarian, British and European, they do not generally identify with the Spanish state. While some in Britain's [[Foreign Office]] would like to see this closening of ties result in an 'osmosis' between The Rock and the "Campo de Gibraltar", there is no prospect of Gibraltarians accepting absorption into Spain. A trip across the frontier, even to La Línea, is still described as "''going to Spain''".

===Relations with Britain===
[[File:Chief Minister of Gibraltar (9614631506).jpg|thumb|[[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[William Hague]] and [[Minister for Europe]] [[David Lidington]] with [[Chief Minister of Gibraltar]] [[Fabian Picardo]] at a meeting in London, 28 August 2013]]
British influence remains strong. Spanish may be widely spoken, but it is mainly used as a vernacular language, English being the only official language used in government, commerce, education and the media. Gibraltarians going on to higher education attend [[university]] in the UK and not in Spain. Many university graduates remain in the UK to pursue careers there. After the Second World War, most evacuees were repatriated, but some stayed on, while many also moved to the UK, thereby increasing family ties with the "mother country". While [[television]] from Spain is easily received and widely watched, the availability of [[List of British television channels|British television]] via [[satellite television|satellite]], particularly [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky]] and the [[BBC]], means that Gibraltarians are as familiar with British news and popular culture as people in the UK itself.

==Surnames==
Many Gibraltarians have names that reflect their mixed British and Mediterranean heritage usually with British first names like [[Keith (given name)|Keith]], [[Kyle (given name)|Kyle]], [[Nigel]], [[James (name)|James]], [[John (given name)|John]], [[Marie (given name)|Marie]], [[Natalie (given name)|Natalie]], [[Samantha]], etc. with surnames originating from all over the Mediterranean and beyond.

=='Gibraltarian' vs 'People of Gibraltar'==

===Gibraltarian British===
While many outsiders use the terms 'Gibraltarians', 'people of Gibraltar' and 'residents of Gibraltar' interchangeably, strictly speaking, 'Gibraltarian' should be used only to describe those [[British citizen]]s registered as having [[Gibraltarian status]].

The UK originally regarded Gibraltarians as ''[[British Overseas Territories citizen]]s'' (BOTC). In 1981 Gibraltarians successfully campaigned against this classification under the [[British Nationality Act 1981|British Nationality Act]], which would have deprived them of the right of abode in the UK, along with other colonial subjects. This was partly due to Gibraltar's status as part of the then [[European Community]] (now [[European Union]]). As a result, the Gibraltarians acquired the right to register as full [[British citizen]]s.

[[British passport]]s issued in Gibraltar differ from those issued in the UK, in that they feature on the cover the word "Gibraltar" underneath "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland". Whereas UK-issued passports state that "''Her Britannic Majesty's Secretary of State requests and requires in the name of Her Majesty the Queen to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance''", Gibraltar-issued passports state that it is ''the [[Governor of Gibraltar]]'' who requests and requires this.

In 2004 an electoral register taken for the purposes of elections for the [[European Parliament]] showed that there were only 95 persons with the status of BOTC. Spain opposed the enfranchisement of the Gibraltarians in [[EU elections]] on the basis of the misconception that Gibraltarians were not full British citizens, but [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] citizens, despite [[Commonwealth citizen]]s living in the UK having always been able to vote in European elections.

===Other British===
There is a sizeable British expatriate minority, classified as 'Other British' and sometimes referred to by the native Gibraltarians rather pejoratively as ''[[guiri]]s''. Historically, many came with the British military or as civil servants, with many marrying locals, and registering as Gibraltarians themselves, although any British citizen resident on The Rock for at least six months may vote. With the decline of the military presence, and the introduction of self-government, most from the UK instead come to work in the offshore finance sector. Many affluent people from the UK and elsewhere are classed as "High Net Worth Individuals", who receive tax concessions in return for buying property and residing locally for at least part of the year. More recently, many futures traders have come to the Rock, since the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) switched to electronic trading in 1999, thereby reducing the need to be in [[London]]. Some in Gibraltar have criticised the current government's policy, on the grounds that too much is being done to develop luxury properties for 'High Net Worth Individuals', and not enough to develop property for local people, a common complaint in many other small offshore jurisdictions. However, this should not be construed as hostility to British people or expatriates.

===Moroccans===
Following the closure of the frontier, Gibraltar could no longer rely on Spanish workers commuting from the Campo, resulting in a labour shortage. Gibraltar instead looked to [[Morocco]], with many workers coming over by ferry and staying in government hostels. Although they paid income tax and social insurance, they were denied the right to either permanent residence or citizenship, only having renewable work permits. This policy has prompted criticism from human rights groups in the UK, who describe living and working conditions for Moroccans in Gibraltar as degrading.

===Indians===
Most [[India]]ns in Gibraltar are in business, many of the shops on the Rock's Main Street being Indian-owned. Initially not able to obtain citizenship, an increasing number have done so.

==Sport==
{{Main article|Sport in Gibraltar}}
The Ministry for Sport, headed by the Hon Edwin Reyes, Minister for Sport and Culture, is responsible for sports policy matters and the provision of support to educational establishments and the governing bodies of sport in Gibraltar.
Under the chairmanship of the Minister, a [[Gibraltar Sports Advisory Council]] has been set up to advise the Government of Gibraltar on all matters relating to sport.

The Government recognizes the benefits derived from participation in sports and recreational activities. Importance is given to the availability of suitable facilities for the practice of sport. There are a large number of Sports facilities in Gibraltar, of varying standards. These provide opportunities for residents and visitors alike to enjoy sport as a recreation and for the serious sports enthusiasts to improve standards and participate in local and International events.

There are, at the moment, eighteen Gibraltar Sports Associations that have gained official recognition from their respective International Governing Bodies. Others, including the [[Gibraltar National Olympic Committee]], have submitted applications for recognition which are being considered.

In late 1999 a Sports Development Unit was set up to assist Gibraltar governing bodies of sport and Educational establishments to improve standards.

Gibraltar's resident population is active in sport and standards are, by and large, rather high, in relation to Gibraltar's population. Participation in officially recognised or other sports events, abroad or in Gibraltar, is welcomed by Gibraltar sports persons.

Gibraltar's sports facilities are also being used by foreign sports persons for 'warm-weather' training. This practice is being encouraged and more and better facilities are projected in order to improve the product for locals and visitors alike.

===The Gibraltar Football Association===
The GFA was formed as the Gibraltar Civilian Football Association in 1895, changing to its current name in later years. It is one of the oldest football associations in the world.

The GFA was formed as an increasing number of football clubs were coming into existence in Gibraltar, and the association was designed to bring some form of organisation to the game there. Between the association's formation and 1907 the only football competition in Gibraltar was the Merchant's Cup. However, in 1907 the GFA established a league to complement the existing cup competition.

By 1901, the GFA had established a representative "national" team, competing against military teams. This representative team continued to play down the years, their highlight probably being a draw against Real Madrid in 1949.

The GFA affiliated with [[The Football Association]] in 1909, but is currently trying to become a full member of UEFA so that its national team can compete in the European Football Championship and the Football World Cup.

===Gibraltar Football League===
The [[Gibraltar Football League]] was established by the Gibraltar Football Association (GFA) in 1905. It originally contained eight member clubs, but it has grown over the years.

In 1909 the league grew to two divisions, and it currently has three divisions which clubs can be promoted and relegated between at the end of each season.

===The Gibraltar cricket team===
Cricket has been played in Gibraltar by British servicemen since the late 18th century. A cricket ground is known to have existed north of the Rock of Gibraltar in 1800. Civilians were playing the game as well as servicemen by 1822.

The Gibraltar Cricket Club was formed in 1883, and formed the backbone of civilian cricket until well into the 20th Century.

In 1890, a ship carrying the Australian cricket team on the way to a tour of England, docked in Gibraltar Harbour after a collision with two other ships. The Australians played a game against a Gibraltar Garrison team. The local side were dismissed for just 25, and the Australians won the game, scoring 150/8.

Gibraltar first participated in the ICC Trophy in 1982, and have played every tournament since, with the exception of the 2005 tournament, for which they failed to qualify. They have also competed in the European Championship on every occasion since it began in 1996.

===Rugby Union===
[[Campo Gibraltar Rugby Union Football Club]] plays all its games in nearby Spain.

==Music==
Gibraltar has a small but thriving pop/rock scene. Its best-known band internationally is [[Melon Diesel]] (1995–2003), which gained considerable fame in both Spain and Latin America.

==Cuisine==
Gibraltarian cuisine has evolved over the past two centuries as a unique blend of various dishes, of which [[Gibraltarian_cuisine#Calentita|calentita]] is the most iconic.

'''{{lang|la|De se}}''' is Latin for "of oneself" and, in philosophy, it is a phrase used to mark off what some believe to be a category of ascription distinct from "[[De dicto and de re|''de dicto'' and ''de re'']]".

==Overview==
A sentence such as:  "Peter thinks that he is pale" where the pronoun "he" is meant to refer to Peter is ambiguous in a way not captured by the {{lang|la|[[de dicto]]}} / {{lang|la|[[de re]]}} distinction. Such a sentence could report that Peter has the following thought: "I am pale". Or Peter could have the following thought: "he is pale", where it so happens that the pronoun "he" refers to Peter, but Peter is unaware of it. The first meaning expresses a belief {{lang|la|de se}}, while the second does not.

This notion is now thoroughly discussed in the philosophical literature, but especially in the theoretical linguistic literature, the latter because some linguistic phenomena clearly are sensitive to this notion.

[[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]]'s 1979 article "Attitudes De Dicto and De Se" gave full birth to the topic, and his expression of it draws heavily on his distinctive theory of [[possible world]]s.

But modern discussions on this topic originate with Hector-Neri Casteñeda's discovery of what he called quasi indexicals (or “quasi-indicatorsl”): according to Casteñeda, the speaker of the sentence “Mary believes that she herself is  the winner” uses the quasi-indicator “she herself” (often written “she∗”) to express Mary’s first-person reference to herself (i.e., to Mary). That sentence would be the speaker’s way of depicting the proposition that Mary would unambiguously express in the first person by “I am the winner”.

A clearer case can be illustrated simply. Imagine the following scenario:

Peter, who is running for office, is drunk. He is watching an interview of a candidate on TV, not realizing that this candidate is himself. Liking what he hears, he says: "I hope this candidate gets elected." Having witnessed this, one can truthfully report Peter's hopes by uttering: "Peter hopes that he will get elected", where "he" refers to Peter, since "this candidate" indeed refers to Peter. However, one could not report Peter's hopes by saying: "Peter hopes to get elected". This last sentence is only appropriate if Peter had a {{lang|la|de se}} hope, that is a hope in the first person as if he had said "I hope I get elected", which is not the case here.

The study of the notion of belief ''de se'' thus includes that of quasi-indexicals, the linguistic theory of  [[logophoricity]] and logophoric pronouns, and the linguistic and literary theory of [[free indirect speech]].

'''Edmund Emil Kemper III''' (born December 18, 1948) is an American [[serial killer]] who murdered ten people, including his [[familicide|paternal grandparents]] and [[matricide|mother]]. He regularly engaged in [[necrophilia]]. He is noted for his large size, at {{convert|6|ft|9|in|m}}, and for his [[Genius|genius]] level [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 145.

Born in California, Kemper had a disturbed childhood. He moved to Montana with his abusive mother at a young age before returning to California, where he murdered his paternal grandparents when he was 15. He was diagnosed as a [[paranoid schizophrenic]] by court psychiatrists and sentenced to the [[Atascadero State Hospital]] as a criminally insane juvenile.

Released at the age of 21 after convincing psychiatrists he was rehabilitated, Kemper was regarded as non-threatening by his victims. He targeted young female [[hitchhiking|hitchhikers]] during his killing spree, luring them into his vehicle and driving them to secluded areas where he would murder them before taking their corpses back to his home to be decapitated, dismembered and violated. Kemper then murdered his mother and one of her friends before turning himself in to the authorities.

Found sane and guilty at his trial in 1973, he requested the [[death penalty]] for his crimes. However, [[Capital punishment in California#1972 suspension of capital punishment|capital punishment was suspended in California]] at the time, and he instead received eight [[life sentence]]s. Since then, Kemper has been incarcerated in the [[California Medical Facility]]. He has waived his right to a [[parole]] hearing several times and has said he is "happy" in prison.

==Early life==
Edmund Emil Kemper III was born in [[Burbank, California]] on December 18, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Genealogy of the Kemper Family in the United States|first1=Virginia Mary|last1=McComb|first2=Willis M.|last2=Kemper|publisher=G.K.

Edmund II was a World War II veteran who, after the war, tested [[nuclear weapon]]s in the [[Pacific Proving Grounds]] before returning to California, where he worked as an electrician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwii-army.mooseroots.com/l/94887/Edmund-E-Kemper|title=Edmund Emil Kemper: WWII Enlistment Record|publisher=''MooseRoots''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brottman"&gt;{{cite book|first=Mikita|last=Brottman|title=Car Crash Culture|pages=106–107|year=2002|isbn=0-312-24038-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarnell often complained about Edmund II's "menial" electrician job,&lt;ref name="brottman"/&gt; and he later said "suicide missions in wartime and the atomic bomb testings were nothing compared to living with her" and that Clarnell affected him "more than three hundred and ninety-six days and nights of fighting on the front did."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cheney|1976|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weighing {{convert|13|lb|kg|1}} as a newborn, Kemper was already a head taller than his peers by the age of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ingrid|last=Pitt|title=Murder, Torture &amp; Depravity|p=67|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7134-8676-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also intelligent but exhibited behavior such as [[zoosadism|cruelty to animals]]: at the age of 10, he buried a pet cat alive; once it died, he dug it up, decapitated it and mounted its head on a spike.&lt;ref name="crimefiles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/edmund-kemper/|title=Edmund Kemper|publisher=[[Crime &amp; Investigation Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Helen|last=Gavin|title=Criminological and Forensic Psychology|page=120|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemper later stated that he derived pleasure from successfully lying to his family about killing the cat.&lt;ref name="coed7"/&gt; At the age of 13, he killed another family cat when he perceived it to be favoring his younger sister, Allyn Lee Kemper (born 1951), over him, and kept pieces of it in his closet until his mother found them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Frank|last1=Ascoine|first2=Randall|last2=Lockwood|date=1998|title=Cruelty to Animals and Interpersonal Violence: Readings in Research and Application|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=978-1-55753-106-3|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martingale|1995|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kemper had a dark [[Fantasy (psychology)#In schizophrenia|fantasy]] life: he performed rituals with his younger sister's dolls that culminated in him removing their heads and hands,&lt;ref name="vronsky259"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, on one occasion, when his elder sister, Susan Hughey Kemper (1943–2014), teased him and asked why he did not try to kiss his teacher, he replied: "If I kiss her, I'd have to kill her first."&lt;ref name="coed7"/&gt; He also recalled that as a young boy he would sneak out of his house and, armed with his father's [[bayonet]], go to his second-grade teacher's house to watch her through the windows.&lt;ref name="vronsky259"/&gt; He stated in later interviews that some of his favorite games to play as a child were "Gas Chamber" and "Electric Chair", in which he asked his younger sister to tie him up, flip an imaginary switch and then he would tumble over and writhe on the floor, pretending to be dying of gas inhalation or electric shock.&lt;ref name="vronsky259"/&gt; He also had [[near-death experience]]s as a child, once when his elder sister tried to push him in front of a train, and another when she successfully pushed him into the deep end of a swimming pool, where he almost drowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lawson|2002|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kemper had a close relationship with his father and was devastated when his parents separated in 1957, causing him to be raised by Clarnell in [[Helena, Montana]]. He had a severely dysfunctional relationship with his mother: a [[Neuroticism|neurotic]], domineering [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who would frequently belittle, humiliate and abuse him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James|last=Sias|title=The Meaning of Evil|p=31|year=2016|isbn=978-1-137-56822-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarnell often made her son sleep in a locked basement because she feared that he would harm his sisters,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lawson|2002|pp=129–131, 136}}&lt;/ref&gt; regularly mocked him for his large size—he stood at {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m}} by the age of 15&lt;ref name="coed"/&gt;—and derided him as "a real weirdo."&lt;ref name="vronsky259"/&gt; She also refused to coddle him for fear that she would "turn him gay,"&lt;ref name="brottman"/&gt; and told the young Kemper that he reminded her of his father and that no woman would ever love him.&lt;ref name="crimefiles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vronsky258"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemper later described her as a "sick angry woman,"&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt; and it has been postulated that she suffered from [[borderline personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lawson|2002|pp=129–131, 136, 139, 141, 144, 278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 15, Kemper ran away from home in an attempt to reconcile with his father in [[Van Nuys]], California.&lt;ref name="coed7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/sara_7.html |title=Creating a Killer |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210031710/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/sara_7.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once there, he learned that his father had remarried and had a stepson. Kemper stayed with his father for a short while until the elder Kemper sent him to live with his paternal grandparents, who lived on a ranch in the mountains of [[North Fork, California|North Fork]].&lt;ref name="coed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biography.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=A&amp;E Television Networks|title=Edmund Kemper Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/edmund-kemper-403254|publisher=[[Biography (TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemper hated living in North Fork; he described his grandfather as "senile," and said that his  grandmother "was constantly emasculating me and my grandfather."&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite news|last=von Beroldingen|first=Marj|title="I Was the Hunter and They Were the Victims": Interview with Edmund Kemper|url=http://www.truecrime.net/kemper/interview.htm|newspaper=Front Page Detective Magazine|date=March 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First murders==
On August 27, 1964, Kemper's grandmother, Maude Matilda Hughey Kemper (1897–1964), was sitting at the kitchen table when she and Kemper had an argument. Enraged by the argument, Kemper stormed off and grabbed a rifle that his grandfather had given him for hunting. He then returned to the kitchen and fatally shot his grandmother in the head before firing twice more into her back.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cheney|1976|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts mention that she also suffered multiple post-mortem stab wounds with a kitchen knife.&lt;ref name="frasier"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frasier|first=David K.|title=Murder Cases of the Twentieth Century: Biographies of 280 Convicted or Accused Killers|year=2007|isbn=0-7864-3031-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lunde"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lunde|first=Donald T.|title=Murder and Madness|year=1976|isbn=0-913374-33-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kemper's grandfather, Edmund Emil Kemper (1892–1964), came home from grocery shopping, Kemper went outside and fatally shot him in the driveway.&lt;ref name="Biography.com"/&gt; He was unsure of what to do next and so phoned his mother, who urged him to contact the local police. Kemper then called the police and waited for them to take him into custody.&lt;ref name="coed2"/&gt;

When questioned by authorities, Kemper said that he "just wanted to see what it felt like to kill Grandma," and that he killed his grandfather so that he would not have to find out that his wife was dead.&lt;ref name="crimefiles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coed2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/childhood_2.html |title=Incomprehensible |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215084914/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/childhood_2.html |archivedate=February 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychiatry|Psychiatrist]] Donald Lunde, who interviewed Kemper at length during adulthood, wrote that with these murders, "In his way, [Kemper] had avenged the rejection of both his father and his mother."&lt;ref name="coed"/&gt; Kemper's crimes were deemed incomprehensible for a 15-year-old to commit, and court psychiatrists diagnosed him as a [[paranoid schizophrenic]] before sending him to the criminally insane unit of the [[Atascadero State Hospital]].&lt;ref name="vronsky260"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imprisonment===
At Atascadero, [[California Youth Authority]] psychiatrists and [[social worker]]s strongly disagreed with the court psychiatrists' diagnosis. Their reports stated that Kemper showed "no flight of ideas, no interference with thought, no expression of delusions or hallucinations, and no evidence of bizarre thinking,"&lt;ref name="vronsky260"/&gt; and recorded that he had an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 136.&lt;ref name="coed2"/&gt; He was re-diagnosed and stated as having a "[[Passive–aggressive personality disorder|personality trait disturbance, passive-aggressive type]]."&lt;ref name="vronsky260"/&gt; Later on in his time at Atascadero, Kemper tested higher at an IQ of 145.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I1Nvvccs7TYC&amp;pg=PA544&amp;dq=edmund+kemper+iq#v=onepage&amp;q=edmund%20kemper%20iq|title=Lethal Intent |page=511|author=Sue Russell|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7860-1518-4|publisher=Pinnacle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cheney|1976|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kemper endeared himself to his psychiatrists by being a model prisoner, and was trained to administer psychiatric tests to other inmates.&lt;ref name="coed2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vronsky260"/&gt; One of his psychiatrists later stated: "He was a very good worker and this is not typical of a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]. He really took pride in his work."&lt;ref name="vronsky260"/&gt; Kemper also became a member of the [[United States Junior Chamber|Jaycees]] while in Atascadero and stated that he developed "some new tests and some new scales on the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]]," specifically an "Overt Hostility Scale," during his work with Atascadero psychiatrists.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; After his second arrest, Kemper stated that being able to understand how these tests functioned allowed him to manipulate his psychiatrists, and admitted that he learned a lot from the [[sex offender]]s to whom he administered tests; for example, they told him it was best to kill a woman after raping her to avoid leaving witnesses.&lt;ref name="vronsky260"/&gt;

==Release and time between murders==

On December 18, 1969, his 21st birthday, Kemper was released on parole from Atascadero.&lt;ref name="frasier"/&gt; Against the recommendations of psychiatrists at the hospital,&lt;ref name="coed"/&gt; he was released into the care of Clarnell—who had remarried and taken the surname Strandberg, then divorced again—at 609 A Ord Street, [[Aptos, California|Aptos]], California, a short drive from where she worked as an administrative assistant at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref name="coed4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/crimes_4.html |title=The Beginning |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215090419/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/crimes_4.html |archivedate=February 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemper later demonstrated further to his psychiatrists that he was rehabilitated, and on November 29, 1972, his juvenile records were permanently expunged.&lt;ref name="coed9"/&gt; The last report from his probation psychiatrists read:

{{quote|If I were to see this patient without having any history available or getting any history from him, I would think that we're dealing with a very well adjusted young man who had initiative, intelligence and who was free of any psychiatric illnesses&amp;nbsp;... It is my opinion that he has made a very excellent response to the years of treatment and rehabilitation and I would see no psychiatric reason to consider him to be of any danger to himself or to any member of society&amp;nbsp;... [and] since it may allow him more freedom as an adult to develop his potential, I would consider it reasonable to have a permanent expunction of his juvenile records.&lt;ref name="vronsky263"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While staying with his mother, Kemper attended [[community college]] in accordance with his parole requirements and had hoped he would become a police officer, but was rejected because of his size—at the time of his release from Atascadero, Kemper stood {{convert|6|ft|9|in|m}} tall—which led to his nickname "Big Ed".&lt;ref name="coed4"/&gt; Kemper maintained relationships with Santa Cruz police officers despite his rejection to join the force and became a self-described "friendly nuisance"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ed Kemper Interview, 1984. 12m9s|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzQCih3QY6A&amp;t=12m9s}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a bar called the Jury Room, which was a popular hangout for local law enforcement officers.&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Santa Cruz Serial Killer Spotlighted In TV Documentary|url=http://www.ksbw.com/Santa-Cruz-Serial-Killer-Spotlighted-In-TV-Documentary/4910038|first=Amy|last=Larson|publisher=[[KSBW]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked a series of menial jobs before securing employment with the State of California Highway Department (now known as the [[California Department of Transportation]]).&lt;ref name="coed4"/&gt; During this time, his relationship with Clarnell remained toxic and hostile, with mother and son having frequent arguments which their neighbors often overheard.&lt;ref name="coed4"/&gt; Kemper later described the arguments he had with his mother around this time, stating:

{{quote|My mother and I started right in on horrendous battles, just horrible battles, violent and vicious. I've never been in such a vicious verbal battle with anyone. It would go to fists with a man, but this was my mother and I couldn't stand the thought of my mother and I doing these things. She insisted on it, and just over stupid things. I remember one roof-raiser was over whether I should have my teeth cleaned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cheney|1976|pp=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When he had saved enough money, Kemper moved out to live with a friend in [[Alameda, California|Alameda]]. Here he still complained of being unable to get away from his mother, as she regularly phoned him and paid him surprise visits.&lt;ref name="vronsky261"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often had financial difficulties, which resulted in him frequently returning to his mother's apartment in Aptos.&lt;ref name="coed4"/&gt;

The same year he began working for the Highway Department, Kemper began dating a 16-year-old [[Turlock High School]] student to whom he would later become [[engagement|engaged]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff writer(s)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/25123957/|newspaper=''[[Greeley Daily Tribune]]''|location=Greeley, Colorado|date=May 5, 1973|title=Page 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during this year, he was hit by a car while riding a motorcycle that he had recently purchased. His arm was badly injured, and he received a $15,000 settlement in the civil suit he filed against the car's driver. While driving around in the 1969 [[Ford Galaxie]] he bought with his settlement money, he noticed a large number of young women [[hitchhiking]], and began storing plastic bags, knives, blankets, and handcuffs in his car. He then began picking up girls and peacefully letting them go—according to Kemper, he picked up around 150 hitchhikers, any of whom would have been suitable&lt;ref name="coed4"/&gt;—before he felt homicidal sexual urges, which he called his "little zapples,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Phil|last=Clarke|title=Extreme Evil: Taking Crime to the Next Level|isbn=978-0-7088-6695-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerritsen"&gt;{{cite book|first=Tess|last=Gerritsen|title=The Surgeon|isbn=978-0-7394-2041-6|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began acting on them.&lt;ref name="coed4"/&gt;

==Later murders==
Between May 1972 and April 1973, Kemper embarked on a murder spree that started with two college students and ended with the murders of his mother and her best friend. He would pick up female students who were hitchhiking and take them to isolated areas where he would shoot, stab, smother or strangle them. He would then take their lifeless bodies back to his home where he would [[decapitate]] them, perform [[irrumatio]] on their severed heads, [[Necrophilia|have sexual intercourse with their corpses]], and then [[dismemberment|dismember]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martingale|1995|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this 11-month spree, he killed five college students, one high school student, his mother and his mother's best friend. Kemper has stated in interviews that he would often go hunting for victims after his mother's outbursts towards him, and that she would not introduce him to women attending the university where she worked. He recalled: "She would say, 'You're just like your father. You don't deserve to get to know them'."&lt;ref name="coed8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/punishment_8.html |title=The First Murder |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210031710/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/punishment_8.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrists, and Kemper himself, have espoused the belief that the young women were surrogates for his ultimate target, his mother, and that the humiliating acts he committed on his mother's corpse support this hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Gerritsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="schechter34"&gt;{{harvnb|Schechter|2003|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mary Ann Pesce and Anita Luchessa===

On May 7, 1972, Kemper was driving in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] when he picked up two 18-year-old hitchhiking [[Fresno State University|Fresno State]] students, Mary Ann Pesce and Anita Mary Luchessa, on the pretext of taking them to [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name="stephens"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stephens|first=Hugh|title=I'll Show You Where I Buried the Pieces of Their Bodies|url=http://www.truecrime.net/kemper/article.htm|newspaper=Inside Detective|date=August 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; After driving for an hour, he managed to reach a secluded wooded area near [[Alameda, California|Alameda]], which he was familiar with from his work at the Highway Department, without alerting his passengers that he had changed directions from where they wanted to go.&lt;ref name="vronsky261"/&gt; Here he intended to rape them, but having learned from serial rapists in Atascadero to not leave witnesses, he instead handcuffed Pesce and locked Luchessa in the trunk, then stabbed and strangled Pesce to death before killing Luchessa in a similar manner.&lt;ref name="coed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coed8"/&gt; Kemper later confessed that while handcuffing Pesce he "brushed the back of [his] hand against one of her breasts and it embarrassed [him]" before adding that "[he] even said 'whoops, I'm sorry' or something like that" after grazing her breast, despite murdering her minutes later.&lt;ref name="vronsky261"/&gt;

Kemper put both of the women's bodies in the trunk of his Ford Galaxie and returned to his apartment. He was stopped on the way by a police officer for having a broken taillight but the officer did not detect the corpses in the car.&lt;ref name="coed8"/&gt; Kemper's roommate was not at home, so he took the bodies into his apartment, where he took photographs of, and had sexual intercourse with, the naked corpses before dismembering them. He then put the body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near [[Loma Prieta|Loma Prieta Mountain]].&lt;ref name="coed8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stephens"/&gt; Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them.&lt;ref name="coed"/&gt; In August, Pesce's skull was found up on Loma Prieta Mountain. An extensive search failed to turn up the rest of Pesce's remains or a trace of Luchessa.&lt;ref name="stephens"/&gt;

===Aiko Koo===

On the evening of September 14, 1972, Kemper picked up 15-year-old Korean dance student Aiko Koo, who had decided to hitchhike to a dance class after missing her bus.&lt;ref name="Scott2007"&gt;{{cite book|first=Gini Graham|last=Scott|title=American Murder &amp;#91;Two Volumes&amp;#93;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=przN8e1MaYwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA49|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-02476-4|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He again drove to a remote area, pulling a gun on Koo before accidentally locking himself out of his car. However, Koo let him back inside—Kemper had previously gained the 15-year-old's trust while holding her at gunpoint—where he proceeded to choke her unconscious, rape her and kill her.&lt;ref name="coed9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/9.html |title=Psychiatric Follow-up |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210031711/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/9.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently packed her body into the trunk of his car, had a few drinks at a nearby bar, then exited the bar and opened his trunk, "admiring [his] catch like a fisherman,"&lt;ref name="vronsky263"/&gt; and returned to his apartment. Back at his apartment, he had sexual intercourse with the corpse before dismembering and disposing of the remains in a similar manner as his previous two victims.&lt;ref name="coed9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton2006"&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Newton|title=The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwNVbOcTncwC&amp;pg=PA144|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6987-3|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koo's mother called the police to report the disappearance of her daughter and put up hundreds of flyers asking for information, but did not receive any responses regarding her daughter's location or status.&lt;ref name="stephens"/&gt;

===Cindy Schall===

On January 7, 1973, Kemper, who had moved back in with his mother, was driving around the [[Cabrillo College]] campus when he picked up 18-year-old student Cynthia Ann "Cindy" Schall. He drove to a sequestered wooded area and fatally shot her with a .22 caliber pistol. He then placed her body in the trunk of his car and drove to his mother's house, where he kept her body hidden in a closet in his room overnight. When his mother left for work the next morning, he had sexual intercourse with, and removed the bullet from, Schall's corpse before dismembering and decapitating it in his mother's bathtub.&lt;ref name="vronsky264"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coed10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/10.html |title=More Victims |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210031712/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/10.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kemper kept Schall's severed head for several days, regularly engaging in irrumatio with it,&lt;ref name="vronsky264"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; before burying it in his mother's garden facing upward toward her bedroom – later remarking that his mother "always wanted people to look up to her."&lt;ref name="vronsky264"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coed11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/11.html |title=Revenge |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210031713/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/11.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He discarded the rest of her remains by throwing them off a cliff.&lt;ref name="Newton2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coed10"/&gt; Over the course of the following few weeks, all but Schall's head and right hand were discovered and "pieced together like a macabre jigsaw puzzle." Police and a pathologist determined that she had been hacked to death, then cut into pieces with a [[circular saw|power saw]].&lt;ref name="stephens"/&gt;

===Rosalind Thorpe and Allison Liu===
On February 5, 1973, after a heated argument with his mother, Kemper left his house in search of possible victims.&lt;ref name="coed10"/&gt; With heightened suspicion of a serial killer preying on hitchhikers in the Santa Cruz area, students were advised to only get into cars with University stickers on them. Kemper had such a sticker as his mother worked at UCSC.&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt; He encountered 23-year-old Rosalind Heather Thorpe and 20-year-old Alice Helen "Allison" Liu on the UCSC campus. According to Kemper, Thorpe entered his car first, which reassured Liu to also enter.&lt;ref name="stephens"/&gt; He then fatally shot Thorpe and Liu with his .22 caliber pistol and wrapped their bodies in blankets.&lt;ref name="coed10"/&gt;

Kemper again brought his victims back to his mother's house, this time beheading them in his car and carrying a headless corpse into his mother's house to have sexual intercourse with.&lt;ref name="coed10"/&gt; He then dismembered the bodies, removed the bullets to prevent identification and, the next morning, discarded their remains.&lt;ref name="coed10"/&gt; Remains were found at Eden Canyon a week later, and more were found near [[California State Route 1|Highway 1]] in March.&lt;ref name="DouglasOlshaker"&gt;{{harvnb|Douglas|Olshaker|1995|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned in an interview as to why he removed his victims' heads before performing sexual acts on the bodies, he explained: "The head trip fantasies were a bit like a trophy. You know, the head is where everything is at, the brain, eyes, mouth. That's the person. I remember being told as a kid, you cut off the head and the body dies. The body is nothing after the head is cut off&amp;nbsp;... well, that's not quite true, there's a lot left in the girl's body without the head."&lt;ref name="vronsky264"/&gt;

===Clarnell Strandberg and Sally Hallett===

On April 20, 1973, after coming home from a party, 52-year-old Clarnell Elizabeth Strandberg awakened her son with her arrival. While sitting in bed reading a book, she noticed Kemper enter her room and said, "I suppose you're going to want to sit up all night and talk now." Kemper replied "No, good night!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ed Kemper Interview, 1984. 18m25s|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzQCih3QY6A&amp;t=18m25s}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then waited for her to fall asleep and returned to bludgeon her with a [[claw hammer]] then slit her throat with a knife. He subsequently decapitated her and engaged in [[irrumatio]] with her severed head before using it as a [[Darts#Dartboard|dart board]]; Kemper stated that he "put [her head] on a shelf and screamed at it for an hour&amp;nbsp;... threw darts at it," and ultimately, "smashed her face in."&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ed Kemper Interview, 1984. 19m18s|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzQCih3QY6A&amp;t=19m18s}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also cut out her tongue and [[larynx]] and put them in the [[Garbage disposal unit|garbage disposal]]. However, the garbage disposal could not break down the tough [[Vocal folds|vocal cords]] and ejected the tissue back into the sink. "That seemed appropriate," Kemper later said, "as much as she'd bitched and screamed and yelled at me over so many years."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Douglas|Olshaker|1995|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kemper then had sexual intercourse with his mother's corpse, hid it in a closet and went out to drink.&lt;ref name="coed6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/girls_6.html |title=The Call |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210031709/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/girls_6.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, he invited his mother's best friend, 59-year-old Sara Taylor "Sally" Hallett, over to the house for dinner and a movie.&lt;ref name="sfweekly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/news/yesterdays-crimes-big-ed-kemper-coed-butcher/|title=Yesterday's Crimes: Big Ed Kemper the Coed Butcher|first=Bob|last=Calhoun|publisher=[[SF Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hallett arrived, Kemper strangled her to death, decapitated her and spent the night with her exanimate body.&lt;ref name="coed11"/&gt; He subsequently put her corpse in a closet, obscured any outward signs of a disturbance and left a note to the police reading:

{{blockquote|Appx. 5:15 A.M. Saturday. No need for her to suffer any more at the hands of this horrible "murderous Butcher". It was quick—asleep—the way I wanted it. Not sloppy and incomplete, gents. Just a "lack of time". I got things to do!!!&lt;ref name="vronsky265"&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kemper left the scene, driving nonstop to [[Pueblo, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="coed6"/&gt; After not hearing any news on the radio about the murders of his mother and Hallett when he arrived in Pueblo, he found a phone booth and called the police. He confessed to the murders of his mother and Hallett, but the police did not take his call seriously and told him to call back at a later time.&lt;ref name="sfweekly"/&gt; Several hours later, Kemper called again asking to speak to an officer he personally knew. Kemper then confessed to that officer of killing his mother and Hallett, and waited for the police to arrive and take him into custody, where he also confessed to the murders of the six students.&lt;ref name="DouglasOlshaker"/&gt; When asked why he turned himself in, Kemper said: "The original purpose was gone&amp;nbsp;... It wasn't serving any physical or real or emotional purpose. It was just a pure waste of time&amp;nbsp;... Emotionally, I couldn't handle it much longer.

==Trial==

[[File:Edmund Kemper, 1973.jpg|thumb|Mug shot of Kemper on November 11, 1973|150px]]
Kemper was [[indictment|indicted]] on eight counts of [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees|first-degree murder]] on May 7, 1973.&lt;ref name="coed12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/12.html |title=On Trial |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210031714/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/12.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned the Chief Public Defender of Santa Cruz County, attorney Jim Jackson. Due to Kemper's explicit and detailed confession, his counsel's only option was to plead [[insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]] to the charges. Kemper twice tried to commit [[suicide]] in custody, surviving both times. His trial went ahead on October 23, 1973.&lt;ref name="coed12"/&gt;

Three court-appointed psychiatrists found Kemper to be legally sane. One of the psychiatrists, Dr. Joel Fort, investigated his juvenile records and the diagnosis that he was once psychotic. Fort also interviewed Kemper, including under [[truth serum]], and relayed to the court that Kemper had engaged in [[Human cannibalism|cannibalism]], alleging that he sliced flesh from the legs of his victims, then cooked and consumed these strips of flesh in a [[casserole]].&lt;ref name="schechter34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coed12"/&gt; Nevertheless, Fort determined that Kemper was fully cognizant in each case, and stated that Kemper enjoyed the prospect of the infamy associated with being labeled a murderer.&lt;ref name="coed12"/&gt; Kemper later recanted the confession of cannibalism.&lt;ref name="coed13"/&gt;

California used the [[M'Naghten rules|M'Naghten standard]] which held that for a defendant to "establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of mind, and not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-procedure/the-m-naghten-rule.html|title=The M'Naghten Rule|publisher=[[FindLaw]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemper appeared to know that the nature of his acts was wrong, and had also shown signs of [[malice aforethought]].&lt;ref name="coed12"/&gt; On November 1, Kemper took the stand. He testified that he killed the women because he wanted them "for myself, like possessions,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/06/03/Edmund-Kemper-III-the-hulking-former-construction-worker-serving/9336486619200/|title=Edmund Kemper III, the hulking former construction worker serving...|publisher=[[United Press International]]|date=3 June 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempted to convince the jury that he was insane based on the reasoning that his actions could only have been committed by someone with an aberrant mind. He said two beings inhabited his body and that when the killer personality took over it was "kind of like blacking out."&lt;ref name="coed13"/&gt;

On November 8, 1973, the six-man, six-woman jury convened for five hours before declaring Kemper sane and guilty on all counts.&lt;ref name="Biography.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coed13"/&gt; He asked for the death penalty, requesting "death by torture."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schechter|2003|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with a [[Capital punishment in California#1972 suspension of capital punishment|moratorium placed on capital punishment by the Supreme Court at that time]], he instead received seven years to life for each count, with these terms to be served concurrently, and was sentenced to the [[California Medical Facility]].&lt;ref name="coed13"/&gt;

==Imprisonment==
In the [[California Medical Facility]], Kemper was incarcerated in the same prison block as other notorious criminals such as [[Herbert Mullin]] and [[Charles Manson]]. Kemper showed particular disdain for Mullin, who committed his murders at the same time in Santa Cruz as Kemper. He described Mullin as "just a cold-blooded killer&amp;nbsp;... killing everybody he saw for no good reason."&lt;ref name="vronsky266"/&gt; Kemper manipulated and physically intimidated Mullin, who, at {{convert|5|ft|7|in|m}}, was more than a foot shorter than he. Kemper stated that "[Mullin] had a habit of singing and bothering people when somebody tried to watch TV, so I threw water on him to shut him up. Then, when he was a good boy, I'd give him peanuts. Herbie liked peanuts. That was effective, because pretty soon he asked permission to sing. That's called [[behavior modification|behavior modification treatment]]."&lt;ref name="vronsky266"/&gt;

{{as of|2018}}, Kemper remains among the general population in prison and is considered a model prisoner. He is in charge of scheduling other inmates' appointments with psychiatrists and is an accomplished craftsman of ceramic cups.&lt;ref name="coed13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/13.html |title=Kemper on the Stand |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210031715/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/13.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a prolific reader of [[audiobook|books on tape]] for the blind; a 1987 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article stated that at the time he was the coordinator of the prison's program and had personally spent over 5,000 hours narrating books with several hundred completed recordings to his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-29/news/mn-2252_1_blind-couple|title=Blind Couple See Only Good, Not the Guilt of the Helpers|first=Charles|last=Hillinger|date=January 29, 1987|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CDCB52453 2011.jpg|thumb|Kemper on November 17, 2011]]
While imprisoned, Kemper has participated in a number of interviews, including a segment in the 1982 documentary ''[[The Killing of America]]'', as well as an appearance in the 1984 documentary ''Murder: No Apparent Motive''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157894/|title=The Killing of America|publisher=[[IMDb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808386/|title=Murder: No Apparent Motive|publisher=[[IMDb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/new-movies/ten-confronting-documentaries-you-dont-need-netflix-to-watch/news-story/23e1b8085646f3a2806df509e8b921d8|title=Murder: No Apparent Motive|first=Jeremy|last=Cassar|publisher=[[News.com.au]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His interviews are notable for their contribution to understanding the mind of serial killers. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] profiler [[John E. Douglas]] described Kemper as "among the brightest prison inmates" he ever interviewed&lt;ref name="coed14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/14.html |title=Prison Interviews |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210031716/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/14.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=John E.|last1=Douglas|first2=Mark|last2=Olshaker|date=1997|title=Journey Into Darkness|publisher=Scribner|isbn=978-0-684-83304-0|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and capable of "rare [[introspection|insight]] for a violent criminal."&lt;ref name="coed15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/15.html |title=Assessment |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210031705/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/kemper/15.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemper is forthcoming about the nature of his crimes and has stated that he participated in the interviews to save others like himself from killing; at the end of his ''Murder: No Apparent Motive'' interview, he said: "There's somebody out there that is watching this and hasn't done that – hasn't killed people, and wants to, and rages inside and struggles with that feeling, or is so sure they have it under control. They need to talk to somebody about it. Trust somebody enough to sit down and talk about something that isn't a crime; thinking that way isn't a crime. Doing it isn't just a crime, it's a horrible thing. It doesn't know when to quit and it can't be stopped easily once it starts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRv8uOnvRBc&amp;t=4214|title=Murder: No Apparent Motive}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also conducted an interview with French writer Stéphane Bourgoin in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8IfslxOmF0|title=Ed Kemper Interview - 1991 (extended)|first=|last=Landau|date=July 8, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=October 21, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''eye–hand span''' is the distance across part of a text, usually a linguistic text that is being copied via typing or a piece of [[Music notation|notated music]] that is being performed, defined as the distance between the position of the [[human eye|eye]]s acquiring that information and the [[hand]](s) typing or performing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Land |first=Michael F. |last2=Tatler |first2=Benjamin W. |title=Looking and Acting |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=2009 |page=67 |isbn=978-0-19-857094-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the eye–hand span is typically measured from the location of [[Fovea centralis|central visual input]], and stretches between the [[syllable]] or [[Chord (music)|chord]] currently being typed or performed, and the lateral location of the simultaneous fixation.  This distance may be measured either in units of linear measurement or in characters or other "bits" of data.  Some authors refer to the eye–hand span as the "perceptual span" for the visual information perceivable around the region of center of vision used in reading,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith Rayner|title=Eye Movements in Reading: Perceptual and Language Processes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx51Brw60cMC&amp;pg=PA81|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-323-14628-9|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases including [[peripheral vision|peripheral input]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Keith |last=Rayner |first2=Alexander |last2=Pollatsek |title=Eye Movements, the Eye-Hand Span, and the Perceptual Span during Sight-Reading of Music |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=49–53 [p. 49] |jstor=20182443 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep11512647}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eye–hand span is analogous to the eye–voice span in [[Reading (process)|reading]] [[language]] aloud and in [[singing]].

The Gaeltacht districts were first officially recognised during the 1920s in the early years of the [[Irish Free State]], following the [[Gaelic Revival]], as part of a government policy aimed at restoring the Irish language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maguire |first=Peter A. |title=Language and Landscape in the Connemara Gaeltacht |journal=[[Journal of Modern Literature]] |date=Fall 2002 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=99–107 |url=http://inscribe.iupress.org/doi/pdf/10.2979/JML.2002.26.1.99 |doi=10.2979/JML.2002.26.1.99 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now recognised that the Gaeltacht is threatened by serious language decline.&lt;ref&gt;Mac Donnacha, Joe, 'The Death of a Language,' ''Dublin Review of Books'', Issue 58, June 16th, 2014: http://www.drb.ie/essays/the-death-of-a-language&lt;/ref&gt; Research published in 2015 showed that of the 155 electoral divisions in the Gaeltacht, only 21 are communities where Irish is spoken on a daily basis by two-thirds or more of the population.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[RTÉ]] News Report of Friday 29 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://static.rasset.ie/documents/news/udaras-na-gaeltachta.pdf NUASHONRÚ AR AN STAIDÉAR CUIMSITHEACH TEANGEOLAÍOCH AR ÚSÁID NA GAEILGE SA GHAELTACHT:  2006–2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Two-thirds is regarded by some academics as a tipping point for language survival.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Gaeltacht 1926.jpg|thumb|''An Ghaeltacht'' 1926; areas of the island of Ireland which would have qualified for Gaeltacht status according to the first ''Coimisiún na Gaeltachta'']]

[[Image:Gaeltacht 1956.jpg|thumb|''An Ghaeltacht'' 1956]]

In 1926 the official Gaeltacht was designated as a result of the report of the first Gaeltacht Commission ''[[Coimisiún na Gaeltachta]]''. The exact boundaries were not defined. The quota at the time for classification as Gaeltacht was 25%+ of the population to be Irish-speaking, although in many cases Gaeltacht status was accorded to areas that were linguistically weaker than this. The [[Irish Free State]] recognised that there were predominately Irish-speaking or semi-Irish-speaking districts in 15 of its 26 counties.

In the 1950s another Gaeltacht Commission concluded that the Gaeltacht boundaries were ill-defined. It recommended that Gaeltacht status be based solely on the strength of language use in an area. In the 1950s, Gaeltacht districts were initially defined precisely and excluded many areas in which the number of Irish speakers had declined. Gaeltacht areas were recognised in seven of the state's 26 counties (nominally [[County Donegal|Donegal]], [[County Galway|Galway]], [[County Mayo|Mayo]], [[County Kerry|Kerry]], and [[County Waterford|Waterford]]).

The Gaeltacht boundaries have not officially been altered since then, apart from minor changes:
* The inclusion of [[Cloghane|An Clochán]] (''Cloghane'') and [[Brandon, County Kerry|Cé Bhréanainn]] (''Brandon'') in County Kerry in 1974;
* The inclusion of a part of West Muskerry in County Cork (although the Irish-speaking population had decreased markedly from what it had been before the 1950s); and
* The inclusion of [[Baile Ghib]] (''Gibstown)'' and [[Ráth Cairn|Ráth Chairn]] (''Rathcarran'') in [[County Meath|Meath]] in 1967.

==21st century==

A study in 2005 by ''An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta'' (The Educational Council for Gaeltacht and Irish-Medium Schools, which was established in 2002 under the Education Act 1998) said that Gaeltacht schools were facing a crisis. It forecast that, without support, few of them would be teaching in Irish in 20 years' time. This would threaten the future of the Gaeltacht.  Parents felt that the educational system did not support their efforts to pass on Irish as a living language to their children. The study added that a significant number of Gaeltacht schools had switched to teaching in English, and others were wavering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/number-of-gaeltacht-schools-using-irish-in-steep-decline-25979924.html|title=Number of Gaeltacht schools using Irish 'in steep decline'|publisher=The Irish Independent|date=11 June 2005|last=Walshe|first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the third ''Coimisiún na Gaeltachta'' stated in its report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahg.gov.ie/en/20YearStrategyfortheIrishLanguage/Publications/Report%20of%20Coimisi%C3%BAn%20na%20Gaeltachta.pdf |title=Report of the Gaeltacht Commission |year=2002 |accessdate=21 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017090003/http://www.ahg.gov.ie/en/20YearStrategyfortheIrishLanguage/Publications/Report%20of%20Coimisi%C3%BAn%20na%20Gaeltachta.pdf |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the erosion of the use of Irish in the Gaeltacht was now such that it was only a matter of time before the Gaeltacht disappeared. In some areas, Irish had already ceased to be a community language. Even in the strongest Gaeltacht areas, current patterns of bilingualism were leading to the dominance of English. Policies implemented by the State and voluntary groups were having no effect.

The report recommended that a new language reinforcement strategy was required, one that had the confidence of the community itself. The Commission recommended, among many other things, that the boundaries of the official Gaeltacht should be redrawn. It also recommended a comprehensive linguistic study to assess the vitality of the Irish language in the remaining Gaeltacht districts.

The study was undertaken by ''[[Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge]]'' (part of the [[National University of Ireland, Galway]]). On 1 November 2007 ''Staidéar Cuimsitheach Teangeolaíoch ar Úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht'' ("A Comprehensive Linguistic Study of the Usage of Irish in the Gaeltacht") was published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pobail.ie/en/AnGhaeltacht/LinguisticStudyoftheGaeltacht/ pobail.ie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117224402/http://www.pobail.ie/en/AnGhaeltacht/LinguisticStudyoftheGaeltacht/ |date=17 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning Gaeltacht boundaries, it suggested creating three linguistic zones within the Gaeltacht region:

* A – 67%/+ daily Irish speaking – Irish dominant as the community language
* B – 44%–66% daily Irish speaking – English dominant, with large Irish-speaking minority
* C – 43%/- daily Irish speaking – English dominant, but with Irish-speaking minority much higher than the national average of Irish speaking

The report suggested that Category A districts should be the State's priority in providing services through Irish and development schemes. It also said that Category C areas that showed a further decline in the use of Irish should lose their Gaeltacht status.

The 2006 Census data shows that of the 95,000 people living within the official Gaeltacht, approximately 17,000 belonged to Category A areas, 10,000 to Category B, and 17,000 to Category C, leaving about 50,000 in Gaeltacht areas that did not meet the minimum criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/census/census2006reports/census2006-volume9-irishlanguage|title=Census 2006 – Volume 9 – Irish Language|publisher=[[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|CSO]]|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this situation, the government introduced the Gaeltacht Bill 2012. Its stated aim was to provide for a new definition of boundaries based on language criteria, but it was criticised for doing the opposite of this.

Critics drew attention to Section 7 of the Bill, which stated that all areas "currently within the Gaeltacht" would maintain their current Gaeltacht status, regardless of whether Irish was used. This status could only be revoked if the area failed to prepare a language plan (with no necessary relationship to the documented number of speakers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/debate/flawed-gaeltacht-bill-in-need-of-brave-revision-1.528204|title=Flawed Gaeltacht Bill in need of brave revision|publisher=The Irish Times|date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill was also criticised for placing all responsibility for the maintenance of Irish on voluntary organisations, with no increase in government resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beo.ie/alt-teorainneacha-na-gaeltachta-faoin-mbille-nua.aspx/ |title=Teorainneacha na Gaeltachta faoin mBille Nua |first=Donncha |last=Ó hÉallaithe |publisher=Beo |date=July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108155554/http://www.beo.ie/alt-teorainneacha-na-gaeltachta-faoin-mbille-nua.aspx |archivedate= 8 January 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual report in 2012 by the Language Commissioner for Irish reinforced these criticisms by emphasising the failure of the State to provide Irish-language services to Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht and elsewhere. The report said that Irish in the Gaeltacht was now at its most fragile and that the State could not expect that Irish would survive as a community language if the State kept forcing the use of English on Gaeltacht communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coimisineir.ie/downloads/Tuarascail_Bhliantuil_2012.pdf|title=Tuarascáil Bhliantúil 2012 Annual Report|publisher=An Coimisinéir Teanga|format=PDF|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report published in 2015, ''Nuashonrú ar an Staidéar Cuimsitheach Teangeolaíoch ar Úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht: 2006–2011'', said that on present indicators, Irish will cease to be used as a community language in the Gaeltacht within ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.udaras.ie/media/pdf/002910_Udaras_Nuashonr%C3%BA_FULL_report_A4_FA.pdf|title=Nuashonrú ar an Staidéar Cuimsitheach Teangeolaíoch ar Úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht: 2006–2011|publisher=Údarás na Gaeltachta|format=PDF|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding has not been universally accepted. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The [[Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs]], under the leadership of the [[Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs]], is responsible for the overall [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government]] policy with respect to the Gaeltacht, and supervises the work of the ''[[Údarás na Gaeltachta]]'' and other bodies. ''[[RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta]]'' is the ''[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]]'' (RTÉ) radio station serving the Gaeltacht and Irish speakers generally. [[TG4]] is the television station which is focused on promoting the Irish language and is based in the [[County Galway]] Gaeltacht.

In March 2005, [[Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs]] [[Éamon Ó Cuív]] announced that the government of Ireland would begin listing only the [[Irish language]] versions of place names in the Gaeltachtaí as the official names, stripping the official [[Ordnance Survey Ireland|Ordnance Survey]] of their English equivalents, to bring them up to date with road signs in the Gaeltacht, which have been in Irish only since 1970. This was done under a Placenames Order made under the [[Official Languages Act (Ireland)|Official Languages Act]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0032/index.html Irish Statute Book&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gaeltacht 2007.jpg|thumb|''An Ghaeltacht'' 2007, zones within Category A]]

At the time of the 2006 census of the Republic of Ireland, the population of the Gaeltacht was 91,862,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf Census 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005303/http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf |date=25 March 2009 }} Principal Demographic Results; Table 33&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 2.1% of the state's 4,239,848 people, with major concentrations of Irish speakers located in the western counties of [[County Donegal|Donegal]], [[County Mayo|Mayo]], [[County Galway|Galway]], and [[County Kerry|Kerry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udaras.ie/index.php/corporate_menu/an_ghaeltacht/gaeltacht_maps/ireland/4944 Map of ''An Ghaeltacht''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602074230/http://www.udaras.ie/index.php/corporate_menu/an_ghaeltacht/gaeltacht_maps/ireland/4944 |date=2 June 2011 }}, ''Údarás na Gaeltachta''&lt;/ref&gt; There were smaller concentrations in the counties of [[County Cork|Cork]] and [[County Waterford|Waterford]] in the south and [[County Meath|Meath]] in the east. The most recent census of 2016 however shows that the population of the Gaeltacht was 96,090. This shows a rise of 4.5% from 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/population/2017/7._The_Irish_language.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Percentage stating they speak Irish daily outside the education system in the 2011 census.png|thumb|The percentage of respondents who said they spoke Irish daily outside the education system in the 2011 census.]]
The Gaeltacht districts have historically suffered from mass migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/courses/geog347/articles/resuscitation_gaeltacht.pdf |first = Kevin C. |last = Kearns |title=Resuscitation of the Irish Gaeltacht|pages=88–89 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being at the edge of the island they always had fewer railways and roads, and poorer land to farm. Other influences have been the arrival of non-Irish speaking families, the marginal role of the Irish language in the education system and general pressure from the English-speaking community.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of this in a local area and the steps taken to counter it, see http://www.udaras.ie/en/faoin-udaras/cliant-chomhlachtai/cas-staideir/ceim-aniar-teo-caomhnu-teanga-i-ndun-na-ngall/.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that periods of relative prosperity have materially improved the situation of the language.

The Donegal Gaeltacht encompasses a geographical area of {{convert|1502|km²|abbr=on}}. This represents 26% of total Gaeltacht land area. The three parishes of [[the Rosses]], [[Gweedore]] and [[Cloughaneely]] constitute the main centre of population of the Donegal Gaeltacht. There are over 17,132 Irish speakers, 14,500 in areas where it is spoken by 30–100% of the population and 2,500 in areas where it is spoken by less than 30%.  In 2006 there were 2,436 people employed in a full-time capacity in [[Údarás na Gaeltachta]] client companies in the Donegal Gaeltacht. This region is particularly popular with students of the [[Ulster Irish|Ulster dialect]]; each year thousands of students visit the area from [[Northern Ireland]]. Donegal is unique in the Gaeltacht regions, as its accent and dialect is unmistakably northern in character. The language has many similarities with Scottish Gaelic, which are not evident in other Irish dialects.

The Waterford Gaeltacht has a population of 1,784 people (1,271 Irish speakers)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://census.cso.ie/sapmap2011/Results.aspx?Geog_Type=GA&amp;Geog_Code=07 |title=Gaeltacht Area Waterford |publisher=[[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] |year=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017090743/http://census.cso.ie/sapmap2011/Results.aspx?Geog_Type=GA&amp;Geog_Code=07 |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and represents 2% of total Gaeltacht population.

All education in Gaeltacht na nDéise is carried out through the medium of Irish. There are two Pre-schools, two Primary level national schools, one Secondary School, Meánscoil San Nioclás and Coláiste na Rinne, a private boarding school and summer college. Gaeltacht na nDéise was one of the few Gaeltacht areas in which the percentage of daily Irish speakers increased in the recent updated comprehensive linguistic survey of the Gaeltacht.{{cit|date=April 2017}}

===Meath Gaeltacht===
The [[County Meath|Meath]] Gaeltacht ({{lga|Gaeltacht [Chontae] na Mí}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udaras.ie/index.php/roghchlr_corparideach_/an_ghaeltacht/larscileanna_den_ghaeltacht_/ire/an_mh/1733 udaras.ie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527173446/http://www.udaras.ie/index.php/roghchlr_corparideach_/an_ghaeltacht/larscileanna_den_ghaeltacht_/ire/an_mh/1733 |date=27 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the smallest Gaeltacht area and consists of the two villages of [[Ráth Cairn]] and [[Baile Ghib]]. [[Navan]], {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} from Baile Ghib, is the main urban centre within the region, with a population of more than 20,000. The Meath Gaeltacht has a population of 1,771&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://census.cso.ie/sapmap2011/Results.aspx?Geog_Type=GA&amp;Geog_Code=06 |title=Gaeltacht Area Meath |publisher=[[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] |year=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203021734/http://census.cso.ie/sapmap2011/Results.aspx?Geog_Type=GA&amp;Geog_Code=06 |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and represents 2% of the total Gaeltacht population. The Meath Gaeltacht encompasses a geographical area of {{convert|44|km²|abbr=on}}. This represents 1% of the total Gaeltacht land area.

The Meath Gaeltacht has a history quite different from that of the country's other Irish speaking regions. The two Gaeltachtaí of [[Baile Ghib]] and [[Ráth Cairn]] are resettled communities. The Ráth Cairn Gaeltacht was founded in 1935 when 41 families from [[Connemara]] in West Galway were resettled on land previously acquired by the Irish Land Commission. Each was given {{convert|9|ha}} to farm. Baile Ghib (formerly Gibbstown) was settled in the same way in 1937, along with Baile Ailin (formerly Allenstown). In the early years a large percentage of the population returned to [[Galway]] or emigrated, but enough Irish speakers remained to ensure that Ráth Cairn and Baile Ghib were awarded Gaeltacht status in 1967. The original aim of spreading the Irish language into the local community met with no success, and the colonists had to become bilingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Nancy|last=Stenson|title=Language Report: Rath Cairn, the youngest Gaeltacht|journal=Éire-Ireland|date=Spring 1986|pages=107–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Ireland==
{{See also|Partition of Ireland}}
In 2001, the British government ratified the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. Irish (in Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, giving it a status comparable to that of the [[Welsh language]] or [[Scottish Gaelic]]. This included undertakings in relation to education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities and other matters. Compliance with the state's obligations is assessed periodically by a Committee of Experts of the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/report/EvaluationReports/UKECRML3_en.pdf Council of Europe Charter monitoring report, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belfast===
The [[Gaeltacht Quarter, Belfast]] (''An Cheathrú Ghaeltachta'') is an area in [[Belfast]] where the Irish language is actively promoted. It is situated mainly along the [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]] and has [[Gaelscoileanna]] (Irish-medium primary schools), a [[Gaelcholáiste]] (Irish-medium secondary school) and [[Naíonra|Naíonraí]] (crèches), together with a restaurant and agencies where Irish is used and [[Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich]], a [[cultural centre]] which also houses [[Raidió Fáilte]] (Northern Ireland's only full-time Irish-language radio station). This has grown from the [[Shaw's Road]] urban Gaeltacht in the southwest of Belfast. St. Mary's University College Belfast, also situated on the Falls Road, is the only teaching college with a dedicated Irish Medium Unit. It is also home to ''An t-Aisionad'' (resource centre) which translates literature into Irish and publishes it for use in schools and other organisations in Ireland.

===County Londonderry===
&lt;!--Before changing Londonderry to Derry, please consult the Irish Manual of Style. Simply copy the following - WP:IMOS - and paste into the search bar.--&gt;
An area in southern [[County Londonderry]] centred on Slaghtneill (''Sleacht Néill'') and Carntogher (''Carn Tóchair''), which had gone from being 50% Irish-speaking in 1901 to having only a few speakers by the end of the century, has seen a language revival since the setting up of a [[naíscoil]] in 1993 and a gaelscoil in 1994. In 2008 two local organisations launched a "strategy for the rebirth of the Gaeltacht", based on Irish-medium primary and secondary education. Speaking at the launch, [[Éamon Ó Cuív]], the Republic's [[Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs|Minister for the Gaeltacht]], said that the area was "an example to other areas all over Ireland which are working to reestablish Irish as a community language".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iontaobhasnag.com/english/textnews.php?recordID=43 Irish-Medium Education back bone of the strategy for new Gaeltacht in south Derry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322091927/http://www.iontaobhasnag.com/english/textnews.php?recordID=43 |date=22 March 2012 }}, Iontaobhas na Gaelscolaíochta, January 2008.

===Dublin===
Dublin and its suburbs are reported to be the site of the largest number of daily Irish speakers, with 14,229 persons speaking Irish daily, representing 18 percent of all daily speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

Only 19% of speakers spoke Irish three or more times per week, with a plurality (43%) speaking Irish less than once a fortnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://languagecontact.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/McrLC/casestudies/NC/NC_Irish.pdf |last=Carty |first=Nicola |title=The First Official Language?

===West Clare Gaeltacht Irish speaking area &amp; North Munster Irish / Gaeilge na dTuathmhumhan===
Parts of [[County Clare]] were recognised as Gaeltacht areas following recommendations made by Coimisiún na Gaeltachta 1925. This was enacted by law under the Gaeltacht (Housing) Acts 1929-2001.  There were Irish speakers west of [[Ennis]] in [[Kilmihil]], [[Kilrush]], [[Doonbeg]], [[Doolin]], [[Ennistimon]], [[Carrigaholt]], [[Lisdoonvarna]] and [[Ballyvaughan]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Dialects of County Clare'', Part 1 and Part 2, ''Caint an Chláir'', Cuid 1 and Cuid 2, ''A Comharsain Éistigí agus Amhráin eile as Contae an Chláir'' and ''Leabhar Stiofáin Uí Ealaoire''. ({{ISBN|978-0-906426-07-4}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Statutory Rules and Orders 1933 No. 85 Vocational Education (Gaeltacht) Area 1933 was made under section 103 of the Vocational Education Act 1930 and sets outs the names of District Electoral Divisions in Ennis, Ennistymon, Kilrush and Miltown Malbay that form part of the Gaeltacht in the Administrative County of Clare.    This Statutory Instrument (S.I. No. 85 of 1933) appears to be still on the statute books.

In West [[County Clare|Clare]] a group called Coiste Forbartha Gaeltachta Chontae an Chláir (The Clare Irish Language Speaking Development Committee) aims to have the area recognised once more as a Gaeltacht. It has been claimed that native speakers who received grants under Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge, a scheme first established by the State in 1933 to encourage the use of Irish in Gaeltacht regions, still live in the county and speak the language daily. It has also been claimed that there are up to 170 people in County Clare who are daily speakers of Irish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogar.ie/default.aspx?treeid=37&amp;NewsItemID=7465 |title=Public Meeting on Clare Gaeltacht Revival |date=27 January 2012 |publisher=Cogar.ie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017105201/http://www.cogar.ie/default.aspx?treeid=37&amp;NewsItemID=7465 |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee aims to develop local networks amongst Irish speakers in County Clare and elsewhere until such time as recognition is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarechampion.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9164:gaeltacht-group-pressures-politicians&amp;catid=41:politics&amp;Itemid=60 |title=Gaeltacht group pressures politicians| date=16 February 2012 | publisher=The Clare Champion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Bank Holiday Monday, 6th August 2018, "Club Leabhar Chill Mhíchíl 2018 - Kilmihil Irish Language Book Club" was established during Kilmihil Festival of Fun to perfect the use of the Irsh Language through Irish language books and bilingual books and An tAifreann mass leaflets.

In December 2017, Coiste Forbartha Gaeltachta Chontae an Chláir published its sixth annual edition of "In Ard an Tráthnóna Siar" [2012-2017], the Kilmihil-based Irish language journal devoted to the restoration of traditional Irish in West Clare. 

On Census night 2016, there were up to 300 daily Irish speakers in County Clare.   

In December 2016, the language committee published its first cárta Nóllag / Christmas Card and its first innovative calendar title Féilire na nGael 2017 and its third information stand to commemorate the decline of Clare Irish. The committee published an illustrative guide to Cúirt an Mheán Oíche and a sunburst and sword of light crest to remind people of the Easter Rising 1916 throughout Ireland including West Clare.    The committee also secured the publication of Leabhar na Beatha in Kilmihil from 2016 to 2018. 

The objective of Gaeltacht Chontae an Chláir under the leadership of Seosamh Mac Ionnrachtaigh is to preserve what's left of Clare Irish up to the current date and to encourage self-contained local language development networks independent of each other to take more to street Irish and Irish in the home and its steady development and progress at community level without State intervention except where deemed appropriate.   Language planning measures are in train but the resurgence of Clare Irish will be a difficult path without individual effort at all age groups across Clare. 

The Irish Language Grant Scheme promotes public interest in the language, an appreciation of the language and practice of the language. The scheme improves the standard of written Irish and revitalises Irish in the county.

The leading traditional Irish language dictionary on spoken native Irish is Impreasin na Gaeilge A-H and Impreasin na Gaeilge I - Z or Impressions of the Irish Language by Seosamh Mac Ionnrachtaigh from Kilrush West Clare.

===North America===
The [[Permanent North American Gaeltacht]] is an area near [[Erinsville, Ontario]] in Canada. It has no permanent residents but serves as a resource centre for Irish speakers throughout North America. It was officially opened in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gaeilge.ie/The_Irish_Language/Canadas_Gaeltacht.asp |title=Gaeltacht Cheanada – Canada's Gaeltacht |accessdate=14 January 2014 |publisher=Foras na Gaeilge |date=2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116081601/http://www.gaeilge.ie/The_Irish_Language/Canadas_Gaeltacht.asp |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irish colleges==
Irish colleges are residential Irish language summer courses that give students the opportunity to be totally immersed in the language, usually for periods of three weeks over the summer months. During these courses, students attend classes and participate in a variety of different activities games, music, art and sport. There are a number of different Irish colleges for students to choose from throughout the country. Many of the colleges while providing a number of activities and events for young people through the Irish language will be known for or specialise in a specific category. For example, [http://lurgan.biz/ Coláiste Lurgan] is commonly known for its promotion of the Irish language through music, [[Coláiste Aodáin]] for water sports and team games, and others for [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] sports.

As with the conventional schools, the Department of Education sets out requirements for class sizes and qualifications required by teachers. Some courses are college based and others provide for residence with host families in Gaeltacht areas, such as [[Ros Muc]] in Galway, [[Ráth Cairn]] in County Meath, and [[Teelin|Teileann]] and [[Ranafast|Rann na Feirste]] in County Donegal, with instruction given by a ''[[bean an tí]]'', or Irish-speaking landlady.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.meoneile.ie/ailt/col%C3%A1iste-aoidh-mhic-bhricne-ag-ceili%C3%BAradh-60-bliain#.V4ZPJLgrLIU|title=Coláiste Aoidh Mhic Bhricne ag ceiliúradh 60 bliain|accessdate=12 August 2015|publisher=Meon Eile|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Popular Irish colleges/Gaeltachts include: [[Lurgan]], [[Spleodar]], [[Colaiste Sheosaimh]] and [[Uisce]]. Most Irish language summer colleges for teenagers in the Gaeltacht are supported and represented by CONCOS, who are based in [[Leitir Móir]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2386">'''Handkerchief skirts''' are skirts with asymmetric hems, created from fabric panels of different lengths sewn together, to create a hem with several  corners that hang down as points. The hem resembles a [[handkerchief]] that is held by the centre so that its corners hang down as points.

[[File:Handkerchief hem 2.jpg|thumb|A handkerchief hem skirt.]]

==History==
Handkerchief hems have been used in women's tops and skirt hems for centuries in many cultures, to add a flattering drape, especially over the hips. They can be seen in women's clothing in art from Ancient Greece, and appeared in Parisian fashions in the 1910s-1920s, such as the dresses of designer [[Madeleine Vionnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirke|first=Betty|title=Madeleine Vionnet|year=1998|publisher=Chronicle Books|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Patou]] followed Vionnet's lead, using the handkerchief hem to transition hemlines away from the shorter [[Flapper]] styles he had helped popularize, and towards the longer lengths that were fashionable during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockman|first=Helen|title=The Theory of Fashion Design,|year=1965|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=New York|isbn=0471105864|pages=40–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the simplest design, a square of fabric is cut with an opening in the middle for the waistband. When the skirt is put on, the four corners hang down as points. More panels of material can be used to increase the number of corners, or points, along the hem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKelvey|first=Kathryn|title=Fashion Source Book|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781405126939|pages=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival==
In the first decade of the 21st century, handkerchief hems returned as a trend in women's clothing. Since the design involves pleats that drape, the effect is achieved with lightweight, flowing fabrics. In 2003, the trend was evident in [[bohemian styles]] such as designs by American clothing label [[Free People]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Good Housekeeping|year=2003|volume=236|pages=230|publisher=Hearst Corp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, handkerchief hems were modelled at Milan fashion shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=JET|date=29 November 2004|volume=106|issue=22|pages=17|publisher=Johnson Publishing|issn=0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Armenian Harisa.JPG|thumb|250px|Harissa]]
'''Harissa''' ({{Lang-hy|հարիսա|''harisa''}}) is an Armenian dish from the [[Ararat plain]]. It is a thick porridge made from ''korkot'' (dried or roasted cracked wheat) and fat-rich meat, usually chicken or lamb. Herbs were substituted for meat in ''harissa'' when Armenian religious days required fasting and penance. The extremely long cooking process is an essential part of the ''harissa'' tradition. Like other ritual dishes, the time taken for preparation is part of its cherished value.&lt;ref name="FFF"&gt;{{cite book|title=Armenian food: fact, fiction &amp; folklore|year=2006|publisher=Yerkir Pub.|location=Bloomington, Ind.|isbn=9781411698659|author=Irina Petrosian, David Underwood|edition=2.|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:ArmenianHarissa.jpg|thumb|250px|Served with sides]]
Harissa came from the word Harees ({{lang-ar|هريس}}) is derived from the verb ({{lang-ar|هَرَسَ|Harasa}}) which means to mash or to squash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Team|first1=Almaany|title=Definition and meaning of Harees in Arabic - Arabic dictionary - Page 1|url=https://www.almaany.com/ar/dict/ar-ar/%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B3/|website=www.almaany.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The dish has been passed on since [[ancient]] times. Stories differ as to the origins of the dish. According to Armenian lore, the [[patron saint]] of Armenia, [[Gregory the Illuminator]], was offering a meal of love and charity to the poor. There weren't enough sheep to feed the crowds so wheat was added to the cooking pots. They noticed that the wheat was sticking to the bottom of the cauldrons. Saint Gregory advised, "''Harekh!'' Stir it!" Thus, the name of the dish, ''harissa'', came from the saint's own words. ''Harissa'' has been offered as a charity meal ever since.&lt;ref name="FFF"/&gt; The dish is traditionally served on [[Easter|Easter day]]. It is still prepared by many Armenians around the world and is also considered the [[national dish]] of Armenia.

==Outside Armenia==
Harissa is known for helping the Armenians of Musa Ler to survive during the [[Musa Dagh Resistance|resistance of 1915]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Albala|first=Ken|title=Food cultures of the world encyclopedia|year=2011|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=9780313376276|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harissa is also very common in Lebanese villages, across its different ethnic communities, where it is usually cooked on religious occasions in a big pot in a village gathering. Additionally, Harissa is used by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] as a dish on ''Eeda Zoora,'' [[Christmas]], and ''Eeda Gura,'' Easter. Harissa is very similar to a popular dish among Arab countries of the [[Persian Gulf]] known as [[harees]] which is made of meat and finely ground wheat.

Harise is also a common dish in [[Iraqi cuisine]].

Harissa is very famous in [[Kashmir Valley|Kashmir]] in [[India]] and it is prepared during winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/823623/harissa-the-traditional-winter-delicacy-that-warms-up-a-cold-kashmiri-morning|title=It's harissa time again: Savour the traditional winter delicacy that warms up cold Kashmiri mornings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is similar to [[Keşkek|kashkeg]], a kind of homogeneous [[porridge]] made of previously stewed and boned [[chicken]] or [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] and coarsely ground soaked [[wheat]] (typically shelled wheat).

'''Heming''' is a British jewellery company, founded in London in 1745. The company has shops in [[Hatton Garden]] within the city's diamond district, and in the [[Piccadilly Arcade]] near to the original store on Piccadilly.

== History ==
[[File:Thomas Heming shop interior and trade card c.1765.jpg|thumb|right|Thomas Heming’s trade card &amp; shop interior, The King’s Arms, New Bond St c.1765]]
Heming's history dates to 1738 when Thomas Heming began his apprenticeship to the Huguenot silver and goldsmith [[Peter Archambo I|Peter Archambo]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Grimwade: London Goldsmiths, 1697–1837: Their Marks and Lives (London, 1976, rev. 3/1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1745 Thomas Heming entered his first mark at Goldsmith's Hall, registered to a Piccadilly address, before going on to trade from his shop at the King's Arms in New Bond Street, opposite Clifford Street.&lt;ref&gt;Sotheby's: Arts of Europe, 4 December 2012 ref lot 405, retrieved 30/10/2013&lt;/ref&gt; Heming was made a  freeman of the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]] in 1746 and rose to prominence in 1760 with his appointment as Principal Goldsmith to [[King George III]], a position held until 1782.&lt;ref&gt;A. Grimwade: London Goldsmiths, 1697–1837: Their Marks and Lives (London, 1976, rev. 3/1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]], one of Heming’s most important patrons, who encouraged this significant new appointment. Heming was the first working goldsmith to hold this post since the early seventeenth century and the majority of pieces were made in his own workshop. The superb quality and refined delicacy of many of the items reflect the influence of [[Archambo|Peter Archambo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?searchText=Coronation&amp;object=50805_1&amp;row=79&amp;detail=about Accessed 4/11/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==
During Thomas Heming's tenure as Principal Goldsmith to the King, [[George III]] commissioned numerous items including the Coronation Service. A large number remain with the [[Royal Collection]].

[[File:View of the current Heming store at London's Burlington Arcade.jpg|thumb|right|View of the current Heming store at London's Piccadilly Arcade]]

Heming's reputation as a British jeweller grew during the 20th century with additional Royal Appointments. Today the company designs classic jewellery as well as contemporary collections incorporating [[diamonds]] and [[gemstones]] set in [[precious metals]].

The formal Thai costume, known in [[Thai language|Thai]] as {{lang|th|ชุดไทยพระราชนิยม}} ({{RTGS|chut thai phra ratcha niyom}}, literally ''Thai dress of royal endorsement''), includes several sets of dress, designed as the Thai [[national costume]] in formal occasions. Although described and intended for use as national costume, they are of relatively modern origins, having been conceived in the second half of the 20th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4666">The '''International Network of Engineers and Scientists for global responsibility''' (INES) is an independent non-profit-organization concerned about the impact of science and technology on society. 

INES efforts focus on [[disarmament]] and international peace, ethics in science, responsibilities of scientists and the responsible use of science and technology, just and [[sustainable development]].

INES was founded in 1991 in [[Berlin]] at the international congress Challenges - Science and Peace in a Rapidly Changing Environment and has become a network of over 200 organisations and individual members.

== Challenges for Scientists and Engineers ==
Rapid changes in our environment and our societies are forcing us to become more conscious of our role in the world. Science and technology are employed in a worldwide competition for military and economic power. The impacts of this competition have global implications. We have entered a phase in which global developments are in conflict with basic requirements for human survival. Large stocks of weapons of mass destruction, the [[overexploitation]] of limited common resources, and a heavily unbalanced world economy provide fundamental challenges to human civilisation and may even threaten its existence.

Engineers and scientists play a key role, both in developing new knowledge that might threaten international security and in providing positive solutions for the future. They are as much a part of the problem as they can be a part of the solution.

== Activities ==
* Lobbies for [[nuclear disarmament]] and sustainable science.
* Works for the reduction of military spending.
* Promotes the awareness of ethical principles and the specific responsibility of engineers and scientists.
* Participates in [[whistleblowing]] campaigns, which support those who have been victimised for acting upon such principles.
* Encourages and facilitates public discourse and international communication among concerned scientists.
* Organises international conferences and regional workshops.
* Raises public awareness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1164">'''Invented here''' is an opposite of "[[not invented here]]" and occurs when [[management]] of an organisation is uncomfortable with [[innovation]] or development conducted in-house. Reasons this might be the case are varied, and range from a lack of confidence in the staff within the organisation to a desire to have a third party to blame in the event that a project fails. One effect of this version of "invented here" is that detailed knowledge of the innovation or development never passes to permanent [[employee]]s, resulting in recurring additional expenditure and a lack of goodwill and bankable experience by employees.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

One quotation that sums up the philosophy of ''Invented Here'' is "Gee, it can't be worth much if someone local thought of it first."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122840/http://gatewayva.com/biz/virginiabusiness/magazine/yr1999/april99/rebel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jewish English languages''' are varieties of the [[English language]] that include significant amounts of [[vocabulary]] and [[syntax]] taken from [[Yiddish]], and both [[classical Hebrew|classical]] and [[modern Hebrew]]. These varieties can be classified into several types: [[Yeshivish (dialect)|Yeshivish]], [[Yinglish]], and [[Heblish]], as well as more flexible mixtures of English and other [[Jewish languages]], which may contain features and other elements from languages other than Yiddish and Hebrew.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The classification "Jewish English" eliminates the need for concern with identifying the specific origin of the non-English components of any such variant. This offsets, for example, misperceptions that can result from failure to note the Hebrew origin of a word that may have become widely known in [[English language|Anglophone]] contexts via Yiddish, and may be, therefore, simply regarded as Yiddish. (This problem is illustrated in the [[list of English words of Yiddish origin]].){{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

'''''Lady Death: The Movie''''' is a 2004 American animated film based on the comic book character [[Lady Death]]. This film was the first animation project produced by now-defunct anime distributor [[A.D. Vision]]. It had premiered at the 2004 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lady Death: The Motion Picture at Comic-Con|url=http://digitalproducer.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=26935|publisher=DigitalMedia.com|accessdate=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released on DVD October 9, 2004, and had been aired on A.D. Vision's [[Anime Network]]. This film has not been rated. A [[Blu-ray Disc]] edition of the film was released by [[Section23 Films#AEsir Holdings|AEsir Holdings]] and [[Section23 Films]] on September 20, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section23 Films Announces September Slate|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2011-06-22/section-23-films-announces-september-slate-mardock-scramble/the-first-compression-avaialble-on-september-27th|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot synopsis==
{{main|Lady Death}}

The movie begins in 15th century Sweden. Hope, the beautiful and innocent daughter of Matthias (a skilled mercenary who is in actuality Lucifer himself), is accused of being the devil's consort. Hope is sentenced by the town priest to be burned at the stake. Matthias, through a proxy, offers her life if she surrenders herself to him and joins him in Hell. At first she agrees to his terms, but Matthias's plan to corrupt her is soon met with unanticipated resistance, as Hope rejects his scheme and eventually finds herself transformed into the powerful warrior Lady Death, who challenges Lucifer for control of Hell itself.

==Differences between the film and Comic==
Many of the events from the comics are altered in the animated film. Instead of summoning a demon with whom she bargains for her life, Hope's spell summons a pair of flying demons that carry her physically to Hell (restoring her badly burned body in the process), dropping her in the court of her father, who intends for her to join him by his side. When she refuses, he casts her out, only for her to side with the master blacksmith Cremator, an escaped slave of his, and to lead an army of hellspawn creatures against him. In this continuity, her curse is to be trapped in Hell for as long as one of Lucifer's allies remains alive.  Unlike in the comic, Lady Death is presented as more of a heroine whose goal isn't to destroy all life on earth, but to liberate Hell from Lucifer's tyranny.

==Details==
The castle of Matthias is based on [[Duurstede Castle]].

==Reception==
General reception has mostly been negative. Mike Dungan of Mania.com (then known as AnimeOnDvd.com) gave the film a C. Dungan states that the script limits the appeal of the movie. However, the animation and acting were fine in that this was a good first effort for ADV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dungan|first=Mike|title=Lady Death: The Movie|url=http://www.mania.com/lady-death-motion-picture_article_76651.html|publisher=Mania.com|accessdate=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crocosmia Aurea at Chelsea Physic Garden - geograph.org.uk - 1429573.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The [[Chelsea Physic Garden]] has cultivated medicinal plants since 1673. The plant shown here is [[montbretia]] (''crocosmia aurea''), used as a remedy for [[dysentery]].]]

This is a '''list of plants used or formerly used as [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]]'''.

The ability to synthesize a wide variety of chemical compounds that are used to perform important biological functions, and to defend against attack from predators such as insects, fungi and herbivorous mammals is called herbal medicine. Many of these [[phytochemicals]] have beneficial effects on long-term health when consumed by humans, and can be used to effectively treat human diseases. At least 12,000 such compounds have been isolated so far; a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total.&lt;ref name="tapsell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lai" /&gt;

These [[phytochemicals]] are divided into (1) [[primary metabolites]] such as [[sugar]]s and [[fat]]s, which are found in all plants; and (2) [[secondary metabolites]] &amp;ndash; compounds which are found in a smaller range of plants, serving a more specific function.&lt;ref name="meskin-2002-p123"&gt;{{cite book|author=Meskin, Mark S.|title=Phytochemicals in Nutrition and Health|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=9781587160837|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cJHsMALUDj0C&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some secondary metabolites are [[toxin]]s used to [[Plant defense against herbivory|deter predation]] and others are [[pheromone]]s used to attract insects for [[pollination]]. It is these secondary metabolites and pigments that can have therapeutic actions in humans and which can be refined to produce drugs—examples are [[inulin]] from the roots of [[dahlia]]s, [[quinine]] from the [[cinchona]], [[morphine]] and [[codeine]] from the [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]], and [[digoxin]] from the [[digitalis|foxglove]].&lt;ref name="meskin-2002-p123" /&gt;

Chemical compounds in plants mediate their effects on the human body through processes identical to those already well understood for the chemical compounds in conventional drugs; thus herbal medicines do not differ greatly from conventional drugs in terms of how they work. This enables herbal medicines to be as effective as conventional medicines, but also gives them the same potential to cause harmful side effects.&lt;ref name="tapsell"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tapsell LC, Hemphill I, Cobiac L |title=Health benefits of herbs and spices: the past, the present, the future |journal=Med. J. Aust. |volume=185 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=S4–24 |date=August 2006 |pmid=17022438 |doi= |url= |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lai"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lai PK, Roy J |title=Antimicrobial and chemopreventive properties of herbs and spices |journal=Curr. Med. Chem. |volume=11 |issue=  11|pages=1451–60 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15180577 |doi= 10.2174/0929867043365107|url=|last2=Roy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, [[apothecary|apothecaries]] stocked herbal ingredients for their medicines. In the [[binomial nomenclature|Latin names for plants]] created by [[Linnaeus]], the word ''[[officinalis]]'' indicates that a plant was used in this way. For example, the [[Althaea officinalis|marsh mallow]] has the classification ''Althaea officinalis'', as it was traditionally used as an [[emollient]] to soothe [[ulcer]]s.&lt;ref name="haubrich"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Medical meanings: a glossary of word origins |author=William S. Haubrich |chapter=officina |page=162 | year=2003 |isbn=978-1-930513-49-5 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic medicine]], [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]] and [[traditional Chinese medicine]] are other examples of medical practices that incorporate medical uses of plants. [[Pharmacognosy]] is the branch of modern medicine about medicines from plant sources. Plants included here are those that have been or are being used medicinally, in at least one such medicinal tradition.

[[Modern medicine]] now tends to use the active ingredients of plants rather than the whole plants. The [[phytochemical]]s may be synthesized, compounded or otherwise transformed to make [[pharmaceutical]]s. Examples of such derivatives include digoxin, from [[digitalis]]; [[capsaicine]], from [[capsicum|chili]]; and [[aspirin]], which is chemically related to the [[salicylic acid]] found in [[white willow]]. The opium poppy continues to be a major industrial source of opiates, including [[morphine]]. Few traditional remedies, however, have translated into modern drugs, although there is continuing research into the efficacy and possible adaptation of traditional herbal treatments.

| ''[[Viburnum tinus]]''
| Laurustinus
| ''V. tinus'' has medicinal properties. The active ingredients are [[viburnin]] (a substance or more probably a mixture of compounds) and tannins. Tannins can cause stomach upset. The leaves when infused have [[antipyretic]] properties. The fruits have been used as purgatives against constipation. The tincture has been used lately in herbal medicine as a remedy for depression. The plant also contains [[iridoid]] [[glucoside]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Iridoid glucosides from Viburnum tinus. Lamberto Tomassini, M.

{{About|the social reformer|the telecommunications executive|Mary T. McDowell}}

'''Mary Eliza McDowell''' (November 30, 1854 –1936) was an American [[Reform movement|social reformer]] and prominent figure in the [[Chicago]] [[Settlement movement]].

== Early life ==
Mary Eliza McDowell was born on November 30, 1854 to Malcolm and Jane Welch Gordon McDowell in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]] as the oldest of six children. Her father was recognized for his distinguished service in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and support for the presidency helped to establish her political conviction. After the war, the family left for [[Chicago]] where her father opened and managed a steel rolling mill and the family joined the [[Methodism|Methodist]] Church. The changes led her mother to become an invalid, no longer able to care for the family, and McDowell became responsible for her five brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = American Social Leaders and Activists|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tKxOpAh78IsC|publisher = Infobase Publishing|date = 2014-05-14|isbn = 9781438108087|language = en|first = Neil A.|last = Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Consuming Faith: The Social Gospel and Modern American Culture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qmgIzBotLagC|publisher = University of Missouri Press|date = 2001-01-01|isbn = 9780826213624|language = en|first = Susan|last = Curtis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the family’s first few years in Chicago, McDowell was involved in various relief efforts and religious involvement. During the [[Great Chicago Fire]] in 1871, McDowell and her father worked to help refugees by transporting people and their belongings to the makeshift camp away from the fire. When aid was received from Ohio, McDowell took the lead in the relief effort and was later recognized by [[Rutherford B. Hayes|President Rutherford B. Hayes]] for her service. She later organized religious classes for young people that attracted prominent figures in the [[temperance movement]], students from [[Northwestern University]], and residents of Chicago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==
McDowell first began work for Frances Williard, founder of the Women’s Christian Temperance Movement, where she met [[Elizabeth Harrison (educator)|Elizabeth Harrison]]. With Harrison's support, McDowell started teaching kindergarten classes at the [[Hull House]] and helped to organize the women’s club under [[Jane Addams]] and [[Ellen Gates Starr|Ellen Gates Star]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = McDowell|url = http://www.chicagotribute.org/Markers/McDowell.htm|website = www.chicagotribute.org|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Midwestern Women: Work, Community, and Leadership at the Crossroads|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2ODrLBzquoC|publisher = Indiana University Press|date = 1997-01-01|isbn = 0253211336|language = en|first = Lucy Eldersveld|last = Murphy|first2 = Wendy Hamand|last2 = Venet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, The [[University of Chicago]] was in its second year of existence and wanted to start an initiative to become involved in the city and looked to the Settlement movement to do so. Working with the university’s Christian Union, Jane Addams, and Professor J. Laurence Laughlin, the university established the University of Chicago Settlement House in the Stock Yard District on January 1, 1894 at 4688 South Gross Avenue. Under Addams’ recommendation, they hired McDowell to head a larger [[New City, Chicago|Back of the Yards]] settlement house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Polish Immigrants and Industrial Chicago: Workers on the South Side, 1880-1922|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pSPzsIKMO44C|publisher = University of Chicago Press|date = 1991-01-01|isbn = 9780226644240|language = en|first = Dominic A.|last = Pacyga}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under her leadership, McDowell worked with residents of the stockyard to improve their neighborhood though education of politic rights and civic consciousness. A major initiative she headed early on was the establishment of civic clubs for both men and women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1894, McDowell opened the University of Chicago Settlement House to alleviate the crowded, unsanitary housing immigrant families often faced. There, she organized classes, provided kindergarten education and accesses to vocational schools, bathing facilities, concerts, lectures, and clubs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She lobbied the U.S. government to establish the [[United States Women's Bureau|Women’s Bureau]] to study living and working conditions of women and children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2012, Bocas partnered with the Edinburgh World Writers Conference (EWWC) as part of a lineup of 14 countries delivering a multinational series of talks marking the 50th anniversary of the five-day meeting of "an impressive, sensational and sometimes scandalous group of writers" at the first [[Edinburgh International Festival|Edinburgh International Festival of Music and Drama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinidadexpress.com/sunday-mix/WORLD_WRITERS_AT_BOCAS-196799601.html "World Writers at Bocas"], ''Trinidad Express newspapers'', 10 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bocas Lit Fest was described by Claire Armitstead of ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "expansive in its cultural reach, reflecting a region that has responded to its own colonisation over the centuries by seeding its people to every continent".&lt;ref&gt;Claire Armitstead, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/05/marlon-james-makes-heros-return-to-the-caribbean-at-bocas-festival "Marlon James makes hero's return to the Caribbean at Bocas festival"], ''The Guardian'', 5 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Bocas Lit Fest organising team comprises [[Marina Salandy-Brown]], founder and director; programme director [[Nicholas Laughlin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://nicholaslaughlin.net/ Nicholas Laughlin's website.]&lt;/ref&gt; editor of the ''[[Caribbean Review of Books]]'' and of ''[[Caribbean Beat]]''; [[Funso Aiyejina]], prize-winning author and dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Education at the [[University of the West Indies, St. Augustine]]; [[Marjorie Thorpe]], former professor of literature at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, independent bookseller Joan Dayal of Paper Based Bookshop;&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperbased.org/ Paper Based Bookshop website.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aneka Lee, [http://www.guardian.co.tt/lifestyle/2014-04-30/paper-based-normandie-bibliophile%E2%80%99s-hidden-dream "Paper Based at The Normandie a bibliophile’s hidden dream"], ''Trinidad and Tobago Guardian'', 30 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Danielle Delon, editor of ''The Letters of Margaret Mann''; local businesswoman Lucita Esau; and Patrice Matthews, a marketing and media professional.&lt;ref name=bocaslitfest&gt;[http://www.bocaslitfest.com/about/ About the NGC Bocas Lit Fest.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival's name derives from the Spanish word for mouth, ''boca'' – the organ of speech and song and storytelling – while also referencing the [[Bocas del Dragón]] (the Dragon's Mouths), which are the narrow straits off Trinidad’s north-west peninsula that connect the [[Gulf of Paria]] to the [[Caribbean Sea]]. For centuries, the Bocas were the gateways connecting Trinidad to the Caribbean and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

The festival's strapline is: "Celebrating books, writers, and writing from the Caribbean and the rest of the world".

The main venues are the [[National Library of Trinidad and Tobago|National Library]] (NALIS)&lt;ref&gt;Annie Paul, [http://anniepaul.net/2011/05/07/the-bocas-lit-fest-2011/ "The Bocas Lit Fest 2011"], Active Voice, 7 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Old Fire Station, in downtown [[Port of Spain]],&lt;ref&gt;Marina Salandy-Brown, [http://www.newsday.co.tt/commentary/0,159128.html "What’s in a festival"], ''Newsday'', 26 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; with satellite evening events at venues around the city.

==Recognition==
In February 2017 the Bocas Lit Fest was named as one of "the world’s very best literary events" in a list of "20 Best Literary Festivals Around the World That You Should Attend" chosen by [[Penguin Random House]] - The Writers' Academy, alongside other prestigious festivals including [[Hay Festival|Hay]], [[Edinburgh Book Festival|Edinburgh]] and [[Jaipur Literature Festival|Jaipur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewritersacademy.co.uk/blog/literary-festivals/ "20 Best Literary Festivals Around the World That You Should Attend"], The Writers' Academy, Penguin Random House, 10 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://103fm.tt/?p=20039 "Bocas Lit Fest named among the world’s top literary festivals"], 103fm, 14 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctvtt.com/ctv/index.php/c-news/news/item/46678-bocas-lit-fest-named-among-top-20-literary-festivals-worldwide "Bocas Lit Fest Named Among Top 20 Literary Festivals Worldwide"], C News, 17 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another accolade, from Jonathan Ford of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in May 2017, noted: "In the seven years since Bocas launched, Caribbean writers have been heaped with international accolades — the 2015 [[Man Booker Prize for Fiction]], four [[Forward Prizes for Poetry]] between 2014 and 2016, and a slew of [[National Book Awards]]. Virtually all the writers honoured — including [[Marlon James (novelist)|Marlon James]], [[Kei Miller]] and [[Vahni Capildeo]] — were first recognised at this extraordinary little festival in the tropics, a place that is only far away to those who refuse to read."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Ford, [https://www.ft.com/content/424a25d4-3f0b-11e7-9d56-25f963e998b2 "Trinidad Diary"], ''Financial Times'', 26 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3038">The '''National Security Language Initiative''' is a program introduced by [[United States]] [[United States President|President]] [[George W. Bush]] on January 5, 2006 at the [[U.S. University President's Summit]] to develop the foreign language skills of American [[students]], especially in "critical-need" foreign languages such as [[Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], and [[Persian language|Persian]]. The initiative was given $114 million in [[fiscal year]] 2007 and $26.6 million in 2008 to expand programs from [[kindergarten]] level to [[universities]].&lt;ref name=Powell2006&gt;{{Citation|title=National Security Language Initiative |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2006/58733.htm |year=2006 |author=[[Dina Powell|Powell, Dina]] |accessdate=2008-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306151344/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2006/58733.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BECA2008&gt;{{Citation|title=National Security Language Initiative (NSLI) |url=http://exchanges.state.gov/NSLI/ |year=2008 |author=[[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=2008-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929044930/http://exchanges.state.gov/NSLI/ |archivedate=September 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of the program==
The initiative is coordinated by the [[State Department]], [[United States Department of Education|Education Department]], [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] and the [[Director of National Intelligence]].&lt;ref name=USDOE2008&gt;{{Citation|title=National Security Language Initiative (NSLI) - About|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/competitiveness/nsli/about.html|year=2008|author=[[United States Department of Education]]|accessdate=2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Security Language Initiative has three broad goals: expand the number of Americans mastering critical need languages and start at a younger age, increase the number of advanced-level speakers of foreign languages, increase the number of foreign language teachers and the resources for them.&lt;ref name=Powell2006 /&gt;

==Criticisms==
Several college leaders have expressed concern about how large of a role the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] is playing in the initiative and, after the program was announced, the lack of details. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Bush Push on ‘Critical’ Foreign Languages|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/01/06/foreign|year=2006|journal=[[Inside Higher Ed]]|last1=Capriccioso|first1=Rob|last2=Epstein|first2=David|accessdate=2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Old Chiangmai–Bangkok Sign Language family''' is a [[language family]] of two related [[sign language]]s: [[Old Chiangmai Sign Language]] and [[Old Bangkok Sign Language]].  Woodward (2003) found that they were [[Swadesh list#Sign languages|65% cognate]], indicating that the two languages are related, possibly due to migration between Chiangmai and Bangkok. There appear to be connections to [[Vietnamese sign languages|sign languages of Vietnam]] (especially to [[Hai Phong Sign Language]]), and possibly [[Laotian sign languages]], but the nature of these connections (whether areal or genetic) has not been determined. Village sign languages of Thailand, such as [[Ban Khor Sign Language]], are unrelated.

'''Palmyrene''' or '''Palmyrenean''' was a [[Western Aramaic languages|Western Aramaic]] dialect  spoken in the city of [[Palmyra]], [[Syria]], in the early centuries AD. The development of cursive versions of Aramaic led to the creation of the [[Palmyrene alphabet]].

Other West Aramaic dialects include [[Nabataean]]  and [[Judeo-Aramaic]]. West Aramaic dialects continue to be spoken in three villages in [[Syria]]: [[Maaloula]], [[Bakh`a]] and [[Jubb`adin]].

'''Paraguayan Indian art''' is the visual art created by the [[indigenous peoples of Paraguay]]. While indigenous artists embrace contemporary Western art media, their arts also include [[pre-Columbian]] art forms. Indian art of aboriginal origin includes ceramics, baskets, weaving and threading, feather art and leather work. Indian art of a hybrid nature includes the embroideries, lace, woodcarving and different metal products. [[Paraguay]] is particularly known for its indigenous featherwork and [[basket weaving]].&lt;ref name=para&gt;[http://country.paraguay.com/arts_and_culture/indigenous_art.php "Indigenous art."] ''Paraguay.com'' (retrieved 13 July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Handmade products==
The handmade products of Paraguay are of a great variety and comprise ceramic articles, as well as embroideries and sewn articles, as well as wood, baskets, leather work and silver work. Pre-Columbian ceramics made in the Paraguayan territory were rustic and made from terracotta clay. They were painted in red, and occasionally in black and white. The clay used to be worked by hand.  Some tribes incised their pottery with decorations before firing.

The Spanish, especially the [[Jesuit]]s, influenced the technical level of production and the finishing of the native ceramics.  These had been characterized by extreme simplicity and production of functional goods.  The Jesuits taught the Indian population in the missions.

Ceramic products produced today by some Indian groups include jars, flower vases, and some without specific shapes, as well as water vases. Among those, the pottery most widely sold today due to its beauty and quality comes from Tobaty and Ita.

==By media==
===Baskets weaving===
Baskets are woven from the fibers of canes. Paraguayan Indians weave open baskets, baskets with handles, hand fans, shades, place mats, and especially ''piri'', the typical Paraguayan hat of the country men. Leather products, such as bags, hats, sacks, etc. have their main centers in Limpio and Luque, where also centers for production of beautiful baskets. Materials for [[wickerwork]] include indigenous [[bromeliad]]s including [[tacuarembó]] and [[caraguatá]], as well as [[pindo palm]] leaves.&lt;ref name=para/&gt;

The rich Indian basket production of Paraguay is dividing by plantations. For example, in some communities where the main crop is [[cassava]], baskets are solid with great storage capacity. The ''ajaka mbya'' basket is an average of 35 centimeters diameter with rigid supports that can to hold the heavy weight of the cassavas.

The ''ajak'' is a basket made by weaving ''tacuarembo'' and dark ''guembepi'', making braided figures as well as geometric ones, in accordance with the Guaraní concept of beauty. The baskets associated with the production of corn are smaller and lighter and are constructed from [[Butia|pindo palm tree]] leaves.

===Ceramics===
Ceramics are an ancient art form in Paraguay, and ancient ceramics have been preserved through the centuries. Ceramics range from the utilitarian—cooking vessels, water jugs—to the sacred, such as funerary urns.&lt;ref name=para/&gt;

===Featherwork===
A precolumbian art form, featherwork provides distinctive personal adornment. Brilliantly colored feathers are fashioned into anklets, bracelets, collars, headdresses, and even entire cloaks. [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] [[medicine men]] used to wear full feather cloaks. The Guaraní create feather [[headdress]]es called ''jeguaka'' worn during ceremonial occasions.&lt;ref name=para/&gt;

===Textile arts===
[[Image:Nanduti lace.jpg|thumb|[[Ñandutí]] lace from [[Asunción]], Paraguay]]
Indian embroidery, weaving, and other textile art are an important source of income for the domestic economy. Before the arrival of the Spanish, the Indians used a horizontal piece of material to make hammocks with cotton threads, as well as the baskets and bags to transport food and nets for fishing and hunting.

Later on they also knitted ponchos and other clothing items. As with ceramics, the Jesuits also introduced new techniques in this area, using the vertical frame to make the threads. Tribal artisans began producing sheets, towels, blankets, table clothes and other articles, as well as the special hammocks, which were knitted and still are with cotton threads and ornaments on the sides.

New technical resources brought by the Spanish inspired the typical cotton dresses, the ones called ''ao poi'', made with a fine thread, and the ''povyi'', a little wider thread weaving, as well as linen, and the beautiful ''ñanduti'', which means "spider web" in [[Guaraní language]] and consists of fine embroidery, with which table clothes, curtains, blouses and more are made.

The most coveted textiles are the [[Ñandutí]] embroideries made in the cities of [[Guarambaré]] and [[Itauguá]]. Woven ponchos, known for their beauty and quality, are made by the ethnic groups [[Sanapana|Lengua]], [[Toba (tribe)|Maskoy]], [[Nivaclé]], and [[Wichí]] from the [[Gran Chaco]]. They use sheep wool tinted in red and the ones called of 60 lists, made in [[Pirayú]] and [[Yataity]], in the [[Guairá Department]].

===Rock art===
Ancient indigenous peoples of Paraguay carved [[petroglyph]]s into stone, particularly in the hills of [[Amambay Department]].&lt;ref name=rockart&gt;[http://www.solarmapproject.com/inscriptions/ "The Theme."] ''Solar Map Project." Retrieved 6 Jan 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Woodcarving===
Wood is carved into ceremonial masks, smoking pipes, chairs known as ''apyká'', and anthropomorphic and zoomorphic effigies.&lt;ref name=para/&gt; Gourds are also carves with images.

==By tribe==
===Chamacoco===
The [[Chamacoco language|Chamacoco]] ethnic group, from the [[Alto Paraguay Department]], used dresses during their annual ritual called ''Debylyby.'' These are knitted of special fibers.  Associated masks are carved from the karaguata tree and adorned with feathers from Chaco birds.

The Chamacocos used a ''pupo'', a protective vest made of karaguata. The ''pupo'' is knitted when the fibers are wet; these become rigid when dry and can serve as armor.  They protected the wearer from the arrows of the enemies.

===Karaguata===
The weaving of Karaguata is an important element of the Indian art. It is an expression of the Indian people of the Gran Chaco. The bags of Karaguata are some of the most common applications of fiber twining. Collector's bags are mainly used by women, who carry them on their backs and have a form of a large half moon. Hunting bags are smaller, rectangular, carried by men on their shoulders.

===Paï-Tavytera===
The [[Pai Tavytera people|Pai Tavytera]] from Eastern Paraguay and Brazil are known for their necklaces made from carved wood and colorful seeds of different fruits.&lt;ref&gt;Flowers, Nancy M. [http://www.everyculture.com/South-America/Pa-Tavytera.html Paï-Tavytera.] ''Every Culture.'' (retrieved 29 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; They use ''urucú'', a red dye made from ''[[Bixa orellana]]'' for [[body painting]]. Personal adornment is made from feathers, such as those of the [[toucan]], and cotton. [[Labret]]s are made from resin. Men typically weave baskets, while women make ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Flowers, Nancy M. "[http://www.everyculture.com/South-America/Pa-Tavytera.html Paï-Tavytera]." Countries and Their Cultures.&lt;/ref&gt; They are also being consulted in interpreting ancient rock art in Amambay.&lt;ref name=rockart/&gt;

===Toba-Qom===
The [[Toba (tribe)|Toba]] tribe makes textiles from colorful wool threads, as well as the traditional bags, ''piri'' hats and [[Trithrinax|carandilla]] leaf baskets.
[[Image:Guaranies-artesanias.JPG|thumb|350px|right|Guaraní artisan selling craftwork at a Jesuit Mission]]

===Mbayá===
The [[Mbayá]] Indians have a special ability in making baskets of natural ''tacuara'', that are decorated with drawings of ''Guembepi'' and animals of the zone, as well as their necklaces and wood carving.

===Ayoreo===
The ''ayoreos bagas'' are one of the coveted Indian handiwork. These bags are made with karaguata fibers and exemplify rustic Indian beauty in its conception. The adherence to traditional aesthetics makes them extremely attractive. The [[Ayoreo language|Ayoreo]] also make dishes and spoons of [[Bursera graveolens|Palo Santo]] wood and feather art.

===Maka===
The members of the Maka tribe are excellent weavers. Their traditional blankets, belts, and other elements are knitted with colorful threads.

===Ava Guaraní===
[[Ava Guaraní]] are highly skilled at making baskets and hammocks. They use karaguata fibers, as well as guembepi for baskets that represent a novelty in the Indian work of the country.

==Social context==
The art produced by these two ways of living, nomadic and sedentary, reflect the difference of each one. The communities based in the recollection system are nomads. Therefore, their lifestyle allows for a more flexible and open culture, with many adaptations. In the other extreme, the Guaraní agricultural society is very attached to the land and its natural cycles, and naturally presents a conservative tendency, which can be closed to innovations. They distinguish their own from the other's property and have ongoing issues about the need to absorb or reject the foreign influences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fallsworld.com/cultura_guarani.htm Guaraní Culture.] 2008 (retrieved 29 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the differences in these societies and the special characteristics of each one, scholars say that it is possible to establish some shared elements in all Indian communities who live or have lived in Paraguay. Indian art – through its symbols and the free exercise of tribal languages – is one of the most important manifestations of indigenous culture in Paraguay.

==Ceremonies and rituals==
[[File:Guarani shaman.JPG|thumb|[[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] [[medicine man|spiritual leader]] with ceremonial gourd rattle and cross, 2006]]
Both the collectors and the agricultural societies have as a social nucleus, a mythical body-ritual, from where they can articulate and develop political power, in the judicial order, free time, beauty, and religion.

The mythical [[axis mundi]]-ritual, in essence the Indian cosmology, is composed of communal ceremonies. These are the moments when the community, through songs, dances and rites, show their identity. Indian art finds its first fundamental origins in those ceremonies and in the human body–its principal support. Feathers use in ornamentation, tattoos, and body paintings in the case of the Chaco Indians and the feather art among the Guaraní constitute basic elements of the Indian art in Paraguay.

==Museums==
A number of museums are dedicated to showcased indigenous Paraguayan art. These include the [[Guido Boggiani Museum]] in [[San Lorenzo, Paraguay|San Lorenzo]] and in [[Asunción]], the [[Andrés Barbero Ethnographic Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museobarbero.org.py/pagina_nueva_5i.htm "Etnographic Museum Andrés Barbero."] (retrieved 13 July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Museum of Indigenous Art]],&lt;ref name=para/&gt; and the [[Museo del Barro]] (Museum of Mud).

Pine Brook Country Club began when Benjamin Plotkin purchased [[Pinewood Lake]] and the surrounding countryside on Mischa Hill in the historic village of [[Nichols, Connecticut]]. Plotkin built an [[auditorium]] with a [[revolving stage]] and forty rustic [[Log cabin|cabin]]s and incorporated as the '''Pine Brook Country Club''' in 1930.&lt;ref&gt; Images of America, Trumbull Historical Society, 1997, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Plotkin's dream was to market the rural lakeside club as a [[summer resort]] for people to stay and enjoy theatrical productions. The Club remained in existence until major fighting broke out in Europe in the mid-1940s and was reorganized as a private lake association in 1944. 

;Group Theatre (New York)
Pine Brook is best known for having been the 1936 summer rehearsal headquarters of the most important experiment in the history of American theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Clurman, Harold. ''[[The Fervent Years]].'' New York: Hill and Wang, 1945. 1968 ed., p.36 p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;The [[Group Theatre (New York)]] was formed in New York City in 1931 by [[Harold Clurman]], [[Cheryl Crawford]] and [[Lee Strasberg]] and was made up of [[actors]], [[theatre director|directors]], [[playwrights]] and [[theatre producer|producers]].&lt;ref&gt;Elia Kazan:A Life, Elia Kazan, Da Capo Press, 1997, p. 152 [https://books.google.com/books?id=R7wKgsVUDUYC&amp;lpg=PT1618&amp;dq=elia%20kazan%20pine%20brook&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=elia%20kazan%20pine%20brook&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Fervent Years: The Story of the Group Theatre and the Thirties, 1975, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Gambler's Instinct: The Story of Broadway Producer Cheryl Crawford, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; During this summer the artists "s[a]ng for their supper" while taking classes, attempting to reorganize their structure, and beginning rehearsals on ''Johnny Johnston'',  their next Broadway production.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 264-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Artists

;Scandals
During the summer of 1936, Paul Green, Cheryl Crawford, Kurt Weill and Weill's wife Lotte Lenya rented an old house at 277 Trumbull Avenue located two miles from Pine Brook in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]. It was here that Green and Weill wrote the screenplay and music for the controversial Broadway play [[Johnny Johnson (musical)]], which was titled after the most frequently occurring name on the American casualty list of World War I. It was also during this time that Lotte Lenya had her first American [[affair|love affair]] with Paul Green. &lt;ref&gt;Speak Low (when you speak of love): The Letters of Kurt Weill and Lotte Lenya&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;A Southern Life: Letters of Paul Green, 1916-1981, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;   

;Pinewood Lake Association
In 1944 Pine Brook went into receivership and was sold, reorganized and chartered as the [[Pinewood Lake]] Association, a private lake association.&lt;ref&gt; Images of America, Trumbull Historical Society, 1997, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Play the white man''''' is a phrase used in parts of  Britain meaning to be decent and trustworthy in one's actions.  &lt;ref name="Complaint made over Mayor of Erewash's 'racist comment' at council meeting"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/complaint-made-over-mayor-erewashs-2217261 | title=Complaint made over Mayor of Erewash's 'racist comment' at council meeting | work=Nottingham Post | accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar American expression is '''''That's mighty white of you''''', with the meaning of "thank you for being fair". The phrase is commonly used by natives of the [[Yorkshire and the Humber]] region. &lt;ref&gt;Smitherman, G (2006). Words and Expressions, Proverbs and Familiar Sayings. Word from the mother (pp. 45). Routledge: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the phrase is obscure. The colour [[white]] has long been associated with purity and virtue in [[England|English]] culture, but the racial sense of the expression may refer more explicitly to the administrators and soldiers of the 18th, 19th and 20th-century [[British Empire]].

The meticulousness of his profound scholarship and his extraordinary dedication to all aspects of Rama's story have led to his recognition as  one of the greatest authorities on Tulasidasa in India today ... that the Acharya's knowledge of the Ramacharitamanasa is vast and breathtaking and that he is one of those rare scholars who knows the text of the epic virtually by heart."&lt;/ref&gt; and is the editor of a [[Textual criticism|critical edition]] of the Ramcharitmanas.&lt;ref&gt;Rambhadracharya (ed) 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Sanskrit and Hindi authors have critiqued and reviewed the works and the literary style of Rambhadracharya, prominent among them being [[Kalika Prasad Shukla]], [[Rewa Prasad Dwivedi]], [[Kala Nath Shastry|Devarshi Kala Nath Shastry]] and [[Abhiraj Rajendra Mishra]]. In his conversations and speeches, Rambhadracharya often employs extemporaneously composed  verses in ''Upajāti'' metre and the ''Daṇḍaka'' style with long adjectives. In his poems, the three classical styles of ''Pāñcālī'', ''Vaidarbhī'' and ''Lāṭī'' are dominant. Some distinguishing features of his Sanskrit poetry include use of rhyme (''Antyānuprāsa''), employment of a variety of [[Metre (poetry)|metres]] including many Prakrit and Hindi metres, new usages, and the ''Gīti'' style. Rambhadracharya is credited with reviving the letter-poem (''Patrakāvya'') genre in Sanskrit after 2000 years. His Sanskrit commentaries have a broad coverage with theories supported by evidence, novel interpretations, elaborate derivations, and an independent style with quotes from the works of Tulsidas accompanied by Sanskrit poetic translations. His Hindi lyrical works follow the Bhojpuri tradition with emphasis on both the aesthetics and emotion. Optimism, devotion to motherland, and patriotism are some more features of his works which are seen in several poems and plays.

==Overview==
Rewa Prasad Dwivedi writes in his Sanskrit poem dedicated to Rambhadracharya that he is an encyclopedia of learning whose literature is like numerous [[Narmada River|Narmada]] rivers flowing out simultaneously, and in whose literary works [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] delight while performing [[Tandava]] and [[Lasya]].&lt;ref name="rpd-review"&gt;Dwivedi, Rewa Prasad. "विलसन्ति रामभद्राः [The revered Rambhadracharya is resplendent]" (in Sanskrit). In Sharma, Sushil and Shrivastav (2011), pp. 643–648. "येषामास्यमहाभ्रकूटशिखरादाविर्भवन्त्येकदैवानेकाः खलु नर्मदास्त्रिजगतीं सम्प्लावयन्त्यो गिरः। तेषां वस्तु किमस्तु दुर्लभमिह श्रीरामभक्तः शिवो यद्वाचां प्रसरेषु नृत्यति मुदा देव्या भवान्या समम्॥", "तं सारस्वतकोशमद्भुतमिमं श्रीरामभद्राभिधं किं सम्भावयितुं क्रमेत न सुधीप्रज्ञावतां मण्डलम्॥".&lt;/ref&gt;

Devarshi Kala Nath Shastry writes in his review of Rambhadracharya's works that Rambhadracharya is an accomplished and eloquent poet who is the foremost among scholars and is also well-versed in all scriptures. Shastry writes that among Sanskrit poets, only Śrīharṣa (poet of ''Naiṣadhīyacaritam'') has been described as having such wonderful command over Sanskrit as Rambhadracharya has.&lt;ref name="kns-review"&gt;Shastry, Devarshi Kala Nath. "अलौकिक प्रतिभा को श्रद्धार्घ्य [A reverential offering to a superhuman talent]" (in Hindi). In Sharma, Sushil and Shrivastav (2011), pp. 643–648.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features===
Shastry writes that Rambhadracharya even talks in extemporaneously composed poetry with Sanskrit scholars, usually in the ''Upajāti'' metre. Rambhadracharya uses with great effect the ''Daṇḍaka'' style with Sanskrit adjectives in his speeches. Shastry recounts a use of a long sentence in the ''Daṇḍaka'' style at a speech in Jaipur in July 2003 by Rambhadracharya, in which one sentence with multiple adjectives lasted around seven minutes and was "replete with poetic beauty".&lt;ref name="kns-review"/&gt;

Shastry says that rhyme (''Antyānuprāsa'') is a distinguishing feature of Rambhadracharya's Sanskrit poetry. Shastry notes that another feature of Rambhadracharya's works is the devotion to motherland and patriotism, which is most evident in the poetic work ''Ājādacandraśekharacaritam'' on the life of [[Chandrashekhar Azad]]. Shastry says that this strong feeling of love towards motherland is reminiscent of old Sanskrit literature including Prithvi Sukta of [[Atharva Veda]], various Puranas including Bhagavata Purana, and also in the Sanskrit works of Swami Bhagavadacharya, a former Jagadguru Ramanandacharya.&lt;ref name="kns-review"/&gt;

Dinkar notes that in the poems of Rambhadracharya, the three poetical styles of ''Pāñcālī'' (secondary figurative sense with short and sweet-sounding compounds), ''Vaidarbhī'' (with compounds and soft contexts and without many figures of speech) and ''Lāṭī'' (with precise contexts and without many figures of speech) are dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Dinkar 2008, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rasas===
The principal [[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]] (emotion or mood) of [[Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam]] is the ''Vīra Rasa'' (the emotion of heroism). Like the previously composed [[Mahakavya|Mahākāvyas]], Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam has all the eight Rasas as enunciated by [[Bharata Muni]]. These Rasas are – ''Śringāra'' (eros and beauty), ''Vīra'' (heroism or bravery), ''Hāsya'' (mirth), ''Raudra'' (fury), ''Karuṇa'' (compassion), ''Bībhatsa'' (disgust), ''Bhayānaka'' (horror), ''Adbhuta'' (amazement). Apart from this Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam also has the ninth ''Rasa'' as propounded by [[Mammaṭa]] – the ''Śānta'' Rasa (calmness), and the three new Rasas as – ''Bhakti'' (devotion), ''Vatsala'' (parental love) and ''Preyas'' (love). The principle Rasas in the ''[[Ashtavakra (epic)]]'' are the ''Vīra'' and the ''Karuṇa''.&lt;ref name="ashtavakra_purovak"&gt;Rambhadracharya 2010, pp. ''ka''–''ga''.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the 10th canto of [[Bhagavata Purana|Śrīmad Bhāgavatam]] and Bālakāṇḍa of the Rāmacaritamānasa, twelve verses in the seventeenth canto (17.42–17.53) of Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam have all the twelve Rasas used in the same context.&lt;ref&gt;Dinkar 2008, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; While the pure Śṛngāra Rasa is the dominant Rasa in ''[[Bhṛṅgadūtam]]'', ''[[Srisitaramakelikaumudi|Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī]]'' is a work primarily of Vātsalya Rasa mixed with Śṛngāra Rasa. ''Rāghavagītaguñjana'' and ''Bhaktigītasudhā'' are works full of the Bhakti Rasa.&lt;ref name="bd-review"/&gt;

==Styles of individual works==

===''Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam''===
Shastry critiqued the work ''Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam'' in the January 2003 issue of the Sanskrit monthly ''Bhāratī''. Shastry writes that the work has poetic excellence, variety of meters and dexterity of language which has not been seen hitherto in Sanskrit epics. Shastry finds the twentieth canto of the epic to be an excellent illustration of Sanskrit poetry in Prakrit verses, a style which was pioneered by Shastry's father, [[Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri]]. The 20th canto has 63 Sanskrit verses (20.1–20.63) composed in Prakrit metres, namely Kirīṭa (Meduradanta, a type of Sapādikā), Ghanākṣarī, Duramilā (Dvimilā, a type of Sapādikā), Mattagajendra (a type of Sapādikā), Śaṭpada and Harigītaka. The language of the verses in Sanskrit, but the metres and the prosody rules follow Prakrit prosody.&lt;ref&gt;Dinkar 2008, pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the following verse (20.13) in the Ghanākṣarī metre, which consists of 32 syllables in every foot.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book | language=Sanskrit | date=October 30, 2002 | title = Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam (Saṃskṛtamahākāvyam) |trans-title=Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam (An epic Sanskrit poem) | first=Svami | last=Rambhadracharya | author-link=Jagadguru Rambhadracharya | place=Chitrakuta, Uttar Pradesh, India | publisher=Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University|url=http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/pdfs/JR2002Sribhargavaraghaviyam.pdf|accessdate=1 October 2012|page=451 (157)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Brajesh Dikshit, Sanskrit scholar from [[Jabalpur]], says that ''Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam'' combines the styles of three previous Sanskrit epics - it has two leading characters like in [[Bhāravi]]'s ''Kirātārjunīyam'', the poetic excellence and variety of prosodic metres is like in Śrīharṣa's ''Naiṣadhīyacaritam'', while the length and extent of the work is like the ''Śiśupālavadham'' of [[Māgha]].&lt;ref name="bd-review"&gt;Dikshit, Dr. Brajendra.

[[Abhiraj Rajendra Mishra]], former Vice-Chancellor of [[Sampurnanand Sanskrit University]] wrote in the introduction to Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam that the epic nourishes the tradition of Ṛṣis, and with this composition the contemporary Sanskrit literature has been blessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mishra | first=Abhiraj Rajendra | chapter=नान्दीवाक् | title=श्रीभार्गवराघवीयम् (संस्कृतमहाकाव्यम्) |trans-title=Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam (Sanskrit epic) | quote=... महाकाव्यान्यद्यापि भूयस्त्वेन प्रणीयन्ते। परन्तु न क्वचिल्लक्ष्यन्ते काव्यगुणाः। व्याकरणदोषाः पदे पदे मनःक्लेशान् जनयन्ति। ... मन्ये श्रीभार्गवराघवीयमहाकाव्यमिदं तस्य विपर्ययस्यापवादो भविष्यति। ...परन्तु महाकाव्यमिदमार्षपरम्परां पुष्णाति। ... धन्यतामुपयाति रचनयाऽनयाऽर्वाचीनसंस्कृतसाहित्यम्। |trans-chapter=Introduction | pages=i–iii | year=2002 | publisher=Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University | location=Chitrakoot, Uttar Pradesh, India | chapterurl=http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/works/sbr/introduction.php | accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam''===
Dr. Shivram Sharma, Sanskrit scholar from [[Varanasi]], writes in his review of ''[[Shriraghavkripabhashyam|Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam]]'' on the eleven Upanishads that it is replete with novel thoughts and Sanskrit derivations, and that Rambhadracharya has shown Rama as the ''Pratipādya'' of the all Upanishads by the wonderful dexterity of ''Vyutpatti''s of Sanskrit words. Sharma adds that the style of interspersed Sanskrit translations of the works of Tulsidas further enhances the literary merit of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sharma| first=Dr. Shivram| title=ईशावास्याद्येकादशोपनिषत्सु विशिष्टाद्वैतपरकं श्रीराघवकृपाभाष्यम्|trans-title=The Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam commentary as per Viśiṣṭādvaita on Eleven Upanishads |language=Sanskrit|page=Back Cover | publisher=[[Tulsi Peeth|Shri Tulsi Peeth Seva Nyas]] | place=Chitrakoot, Satna, India| date= April 5, 1998| quote=श्रीराघवकृपाभाष्यं सर्वत्रैवाभिनवविचारैर्व्युत्पत्तिभिश्चालङ्कृतं विभाति। भाष्येऽस्मिन्नाचार्यचरणैः शब्दव्युत्पत्तिचातुरीचमत्कारेण सर्वोपनिषदां प्रतिपाद्यः भगवान् श्रीराम एवेति सिद्धान्तितम्। मध्ये मध्ये गोस्वामिश्रीतुलसीदासग्रन्थेभ्यः ससंस्कृतरूपान्तरमुदाहृता अंशविशेषाः सुवर्णे सुरभिमातन्वन्ति।}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Vishnu Dutt Rakesh, Hindi professor and author from [[Haridwar]], says that the ''Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam'' on Bhagavad Gita has the broadest coverage of all Sanskrit commentaries on Gita with "convincing discussion, propounding of theories with evidence, contradiction of others, creative genius and an independent style of composition".&lt;ref name="vdr-review"&gt;Rakesh, Dr. Vishnu Dutt. ''Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣya – Commentary on Śrīmadbhagavadgītā''. In Nagar (2002), pp. 735–743.&lt;/ref&gt; Dikshit says that the ''Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam'' on the [[Prasthanatrayi|Prasthānatrayī]] is formidable and adorns the Ramananda tradition with greatness. He adds that the ''Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam'' on Narada Bhakti Sutra and Śrīrāmastavarājastotram are successful in establishing the five ''Prasthāna''s in place of the three ''Prasthāna''s of Prasthānatrayī.&lt;ref name="bd-review"/&gt; Dr. Ram Chandra Prasad, author of bilingual English and Hindi commentaries on the Ramcharitmanas, says that the ''Mahavīrī'' commentary is "adorned with erudition" and considers it to be "the best exposition of Hanuman Chalisa."&lt;ref name="prasad-hc"&gt;Prasad 1999, p. 849: श्रीहनुमानचालीसा की सर्वश्रेष्ठ व्याख्या के लिए देखें महावीरी व्याख्या, जिसके लेखक हैं प्रज्ञाचक्षु आचार्य श्रीरामभद्रदासजी। श्रीहनुमानचालीसा के प्रस्तुत भाष्य का आधार श्रीरामभद्रदासजी की ही वैदुष्यमंडित टीका है। इसके लिए मैं आचार्यप्रवर का ऋणी हूँ। [For the best explanation of Hanuman Chalisa, refer the ''Mahāvīrī'' commentary, whose author is the visually-disabled Acharya Rambhadradas.

===Other works===
[[Kalika Prasad Shukla]] was one of the examiners of the PhD dissertation of Rambhadracharya (then known as Giridhar Mishra) in 1981. After examining his Sanskrit thesis titled ''Adhyātmarāmāyaṇe Apāṇinīyaprayogānāṃ Vimarśaḥ'' (''Deliberation on the non-[[Pāṇini|Paninian]] usages in the [[Adhyatma Ramayana]]''), he wrote a Sanskrit verse–&lt;ref&gt;Nagar 2002, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kalanath Shastry also critiqued the work ''Bhṛṅgadūtam'', about which he says that it has many new usages (''Prayoga''s) not seen earlier in Sanskrit poetry. As per Shastry, new dimensions in Sanskrit literature are seen in the play ''Śrīrāghavābhyudayam'' where there are songs in the ''Gīti'' style, and [[Gitaramayanam|Gītarāmāyaṇam]] which is an epic poem in the ''Gīti'' style of [[Gita Govinda|Gītagovindam]] by [[Jayadeva]].&lt;ref name="kns-review"/&gt; Dikshit writes that ''Kubjāpatram'' is a revival of the letter-poem (''Patrakāvya'') genre in Sanskrit after 2000 years, and is the first work in Sanskrit literature whose lead character is disabled.&lt;ref name="bd-review"/&gt;

Dikshit is of the view that the eight ''Utprekṣā'' figures of speech in ''Śrīrāghavabhāvadarśanam'' have excelled the ''Utprekṣā'' style of the poet Karṇapūra, while the erudition and poetic skill displayed in ''Śrīsarayūlaharī'' makes the reader forget the ''Gaṅgālaharī'' of [[Paṇḍitarāja Jagannātha]]. He holds the work [[Arundhati (epic)|Arundhatī]] to be an eminent epic in [[Khariboli|Khariboli Hindi]] after the [[Kamayani|Kāmāyanī]] of [[Jaishankar Prasad]]. He observes that while Kāmāyanī goes from creation to optimism to pessimism and ends with indifference, Arundhatī is optimistic from beginning to end and establishes the virtues of Hinduism as enshrined in the Ramayana. About the lyrical Hindi works ''Rāghavagītaguñjana'' and ''Bhaktigītasudhā'', Dikshit says that the works are steeped in Bhakti Rasa and are reminiscent of the works of Tulsidas, [[Surdas]] and Mirabai.&lt;ref name="bd-review"/&gt; On ''Bhaktigītasudhā'', Shraddha Gupta writes that the work follows the Bhojpuri tradition where the sentimental and artistic aspects are both developed.&lt;ref name="sg-review"&gt;Gupta, Shraddha. ''Bhaktigītasudhā – An appraisal''. In Nagar (2002), pp. 744–747.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dikshit says that the nationalistic play ''Śrīrāghavābhyudayam'' establishes Rambhadracharya as a successful playwright at a young age. Dikshit praises the aesthetics of the work ''Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī'' saying that it represents all the six ''Sampradāya''s of Indian literature (''Rīti'', ''Rasa'', ''Alaṅkāra'', ''Dhvani'', ''Vakrokti'' and ''Aucitya''), and that it is a unique work of Rambhadracharya when it comes to figures of speech. Dikshit says that this work places Rambhadracharya in the league of ''Ritikavya'' poets like [[Raskhan]], [[Keshavdas]], Ghananand and Padmakar; but observes the distinction that while the works of all these poets are primarily in the [[Sringara|Śṛngāra]] Rasa, ''Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī'' is a work which has Vātsalya Rasa as the primary emotion, which is augmented by Śṛngāra Rasa.&lt;ref name="bd-review"/&gt;

'''Richard Parkes Bonington''' (25 October 1802&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt; – 23 September 1828) was an English [[Romanticism (art)|Romantic]] [[Landscape art|landscape]] painter, who moved to France at the age of 14 and can also be considered as a French artist, and an intermediary bringing aspects of English style to France.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 171&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming, after his very early death, one of the most influential British artists of his time, the facility of his style was inspired by the old masters, yet was entirely modern in its application. His landscapes were mostly of coastal scenes, with a low horizon and large sky, showing a brilliant handling of light and atmosphere. He also painted small historical [[cabinet painting]]s in a freely-handled version of the [[troubadour style]].

==Life and work==
[[File:Richard Parkes Bonington 003.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[Francis I of France|François I]] and [[Marguerite de Navarre]]'' (45.7 by 34.5 cm), based on the discovery of a scratched inscription on a window at the [[Château de Chambord]]]]

Richard Parkes Bonington was born in the town of [[Arnold, Nottinghamshire|Arnold]], four miles from [[Nottingham]].&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;"Arnold" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 633.&lt;/ref&gt; His father also known as Richard was successively a gaoler, a drawing master and lace-maker, and his mother a teacher. Bonington learned watercolour painting from his father and exhibited paintings at the [[Liverpool Academy of Arts|Liverpool Academy]] at the age of eleven.

In 1817, Bonington's family moved to [[Calais]], France, where his father had set up a lace factory. At this time, Bonington started taking lessons from the painter [[François Louis Thomas Francia]],&lt;ref name="Ingamells, 19"&gt;Ingamells, 19&lt;/ref&gt; who, having recently returned from England, where he had been deeply influenced by the work of [[Thomas Girtin]],&lt;ref&gt;Binyon, pp.166 – 7&lt;/ref&gt; taught him the English watercolour technique. In 1818, the Bonington family moved to Paris to open a lace shop. There he met and became friends with [[Eugène Delacroix]]. He worked for a time producing copies of Dutch and Flemish landscapes in the [[Louvre]]. In 1820, he started attending the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris, where he studied under [[Antoine-Jean, Baron Gros]].&lt;ref name="Ingamells, 19"/&gt;

It was around this time that Bonington started going on sketching tours in the suburbs of Paris and the surrounding countryside. His first paintings were exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1822. He also began to work in oils and lithography, illustrating [[Baron Isidore Justin Séverin Taylor|Baron Taylor]]'s ''Voyages pittoresques dans l'ancienne France'' and his own architectural series ''Restes et Fragmens''. In 1824, he won a gold medal at the Paris Salon along with [[John Constable]] and [[Anthony Vandyke Copley Fielding]], and spent most of the year painting coastal views in [[Dunkirk]].&lt;ref name="Ingamells, 19"/&gt;

In 1825 he met Delacroix on a visit with [[Alexandre-Marie Colin]] to London, and they sketched together there, and shared a studio for some months in Paris on their return; Delacroix influenced him in turning to historical painting. He also developed a technique mixing watercolour with [[gouache]] and gum, achieving an effect close to oil painting.  In 1826 he visited northern Italy,&lt;ref name="Ingamells, 19-20"&gt;Ingamells, 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; staying in Venice for a month,&lt;ref name="Binyon, pp.169"&gt;Binyon, pp. 169&lt;/ref&gt; and London again in 1827–8. In late 1828 his [[tuberculosis]] worsened and his parents sent him back to London for treatment. Bonington died of tuberculosis on 23 September 1828 at 29 Tottenham Street in London, aged 25.&lt;ref name="Ingamells, 19-20"/&gt;

==Reputation==
[[File:Landscape near Quilleboeuf Richard Parkes Bonington.jpeg|thumb|right|240px|''Landscape near Quilleboeuf'', c. 1824–1825. [[Yale Center for British Art]]]]
Delacroix paid tribute to Bonington's work in a letter to [[Théophile Thoré]] in 1861. It reads, in part:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I met him for the first time, I too was very young and was making studies in the Louvre: this was around 1816 or 1817... Already in this genre (watercolor), which was an English novelty at that time, he had an astonishing ability... To my mind, one can find in other modern artists qualities of strength and of precision in rendering that are superior to those in Bonington's pictures, but no one in this modern school, and perhaps even before, has possessed that lightness of touch which, especially in watercolours, makes his works a type of diamond which flatters and ravishes the eye, independently of any subject and any imitation.&lt;ref&gt;Noon, Patrick: ''Richard Parkes Bonington "On the Pleasure of Painting"'', page 12. [[Yale University Press]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To [[Laurence Binyon]] however, "Bonington's extraordinary technical gift was also his enemy. There is none of the interest of struggle in his painting."&lt;ref name="Binyon, pp.169"/&gt;

Bonington had a number of close followers, such as Roqueplan and Isabey in France, and [[Thomas Shotter Boys]], James Holland, [[William Callow]] and [[John Scarlett Davis]] in England. In addition, there were many copies and forgeries of his work made in the period immediately after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Watercolours|first=Graham|last=Reynolds|series=World of Art|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|page=108|year=1998|origyear=1971 (as ''A Concise History of Watercolour''))}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statue to him was erected outside the [[Nottingham Trent University, School of Art and Design|Nottingham School of Art]] by [[Watson Fothergill]], and a theatre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arnold|url=http://www.gedling.gov.uk/businesslicensing/towncentres/arnold/|work=Gedling Borough Council website|publisher=Gedling Borough Council|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and primary school in his home town of [[Arnold, Nottinghamshire|Arnold]] are named after him. In addition, the house in which he was born (79 High Street, Arnold) is now named ‘Bonington House’ and is Grade&amp;nbsp;II [[Listed building|listed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Listed Buildings|url=http://www.gedling.gov.uk/media/documents/planningbuildingcontrol/listed_buildings_GedlingBor.pdf|publisher=Gedling Borough Council|accessdate=21 May 2014|author=Gedling Borough Council Planning and Environment Department Local Plans Section|date=6 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wallace Collection]] has an especially large group of 35 works, representing both his landscapes and [[history painting]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15357">The '''Romanes Lecture''' is a prestigious free public lecture given annually at the [[Sheldonian Theatre]], [[Oxford]], England.

The lecture series was founded by, and named after, the biologist [[George Romanes]], and has been running since 1892. Over the years, many notable figures from the Arts and Sciences have been invited to speak. The lecture can be on any subject in science, art or literature, approved by the [[John Hood (university administrator)|Vice-Chancellor]] of the [[University of Oxford|University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15815">In [[statistics]], '''survey sampling''' describes the process of selecting a sample of elements from a target [[statistical population|population]] to conduct a survey. 
The term [[Statistical survey|"survey"]] may refer to many different types or techniques of observation.  In survey sampling it most often involves a questionnaire used to measure the characteristics and/or attitudes of people. Different ways of contacting members of a sample once they have been selected is the subject of [[survey data collection]]. The purpose of [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] is to reduce the cost and/or the amount of work that it would take to survey the entire target population.  A survey that measures the entire target population is called a [[census]].

Survey samples can be broadly divided into two types: probability samples and non-probability samples.  Probability-based samples implement a sampling plan with specified probabilities (perhaps adapted probabilities specified by an adaptive procedure). Probability-based sampling allows design-based inference about the target population. The inferences are based on a known objective probability distribution that was specified in the study protocol. Inferences from probability-based surveys may still suffer from many types of bias.

Surveys that are not based on probability sampling have greater difficulty measuring their bias or [[sampling error]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  Surveys based on non-probability samples often fail to represent the people in the target population.&lt;ref&gt;Weisberg, Herbert F. (2005), The Total Survey Error Approach, University of Chicago Press: Chicago. p.231.&lt;/ref&gt;

In academic and government survey research, probability sampling is a standard procedure. In the United States, the [[Office of Management and Budget]]'s "List of Standards for Statistical Surveys" states that federally funded surveys must be performed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
selecting samples using generally accepted statistical methods (e.g., probabilistic methods that can provide estimates of sampling error). Any use of nonprobability sampling methods (e.g., cut-off or model-based samples) must be justified statistically and be able to measure estimation error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg/statpolicy/standards_stat_surveys.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612004036/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg/statpolicy/standards_stat_surveys.pdf |archivedate=2009-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Besides, random sampling and design-based inference are supplemented by other statistical methods, such as model-assisted sampling and model-based sampling.&lt;ref&gt;Lohr. Brewer. Swedes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Valliant, Alan H. Dorfman, and Richard M. Royall (2000), Finite Population Sampling and Inference: A Prediction Approach, Wiley, New York, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, many surveys have substantial amounts of nonresponse. Even though the units are initially chosen with known probabilities, the nonresponse mechanisms are unknown. For surveys with substantial nonresponse, statisticians have proposed statistical models, with which data sets are analyzed.

Issues related to survey sampling are discussed in several sources including Salant and Dillman (1994).&lt;ref&gt;Salant, Priscilla, I. Dillman, and A. Don. How to conduct your own survey. No. 300.723 S3. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Probability sampling==
In a probability sample (also called "scientific" or "random" sample) each member of the target population has a known and non-zero probability of inclusion in the sample.&lt;ref&gt;Kish, L. (1965), Survey Sampling, New York: Wiley. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; A survey based on a probability sample can in theory produce statistical measurements of the target population that are: 
* [[unbiased]], the expected value of the sample mean is equal to the population mean E(ȳ)=μ, and&lt;ref&gt;Kish, L. (1965), Survey Sampling, New York: Wiley. p.59&lt;/ref&gt;
* have a measurable sampling error, which can be expressed as a [[confidence interval]], or [[margin of error]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/For-Researchers/Poll-Survey-FAQ/Why-Sampling-Works.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
  
A probability-based survey sample is created by constructing a list of the target population, called the [[sampling frame]], a randomized process for selecting units from the sample frame, called a selection procedure, and a method of contacting selected units to enable them complete the survey, called a data collection method or mode.&lt;ref&gt;Groves et al., Survey Methodology, Wiley: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  For some target populations this process may be easy, for example, sampling the employees of a company by using payroll list.  However, in large, disorganized populations simply constructing a suitable sample frame is often a complex and expensive task.

Common methods of conducting a probability sample of the household population in the United States are Area Probability Sampling, Random Digit Dial telephone sampling, and more recently, Address-Based Sampling.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Link, Michael P. Battaglia, Martin R. Frankel, Larry Osborn, and Ali H. Mokdad, A Comparison of Address-Based Sampling (ABS) Versus Random-Digit Dialing (RDD) for General Population Surveys; Public Opinion Q, Spring 2008; 72: 6 - 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within probability sampling, there are specialized techniques such as [[stratified sampling]] and [[cluster sampling]] that improve the precision or efficiency of the sampling process without altering the fundamental principles of probability sampling.

Stratification is the process of dividing members of the population into homogeneous subgroups before sampling. The strata should be mutually exclusive: every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum. The strata should also be collectively exhaustive: no population element can be excluded. Then methods such as simple random sampling or systematic sampling can be applied within each stratum. This often improves the representativeness of the sample by reducing sampling error.

==Bias in probability sampling==
{{Main article|Sampling bias}}
Bias in surveys is undesirable, but often unavoidable.  The major types of bias that may occur in the sampling process are:
* [[Non-response bias]]:  When individuals or households selected in the survey sample cannot or will not complete the survey there is the potential for bias to result from this non-response.  Nonresponse bias occurs when the observed value deviates from the population parameter due to differences between respondents and nonrespondents.&lt;ref&gt;http://nces.ed.gov/StatProg/2002/glossary.asp#nonresponse&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Response bias]]: This is not the opposite of non-response bias, but instead relates to a possible tendency of respondents to give inaccurate or untruthful answers for various reasons.
* Selection Bias: Selection bias occurs when some units have a differing probability of selection that is unaccounted for by the researcher.  For example, some households have multiple phone numbers making them more likely to be selected in a telephone survey than households with only one phone number.  This selection bias would be corrected by applying a [[survey weight]] equal to [1/(# of phone numbers)] to each household.
* [[Self-selection bias]]: A type of bias in which individuals voluntarily select themselves into a group, thereby potentially biasing the response of that group.
* [[Participation bias]]: Bias that arises due to the characteristics of those who choose to participate in a survey or poll.
* Coverage bias: Coverage bias can occur when population members do not appear in the sample frame (undercoverage).  Coverage bias occurs when the observed value deviates from the population parameter due to differences between covered and non-covered units.  Telephone surveys suffer from a well known source of coverage bias because they cannot include households without telephones.

==Non-probability sampling==

Many surveys are not based on probability samples, but rather on finding a suitable collection of respondents to complete the survey.  Some common examples of non-probability sampling are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statpac.com/surveys/sampling.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Judgement Samples:  A researcher decides which population members to include in the sample based on his or her judgement.  The researcher may provide some alternative justification for the representativeness of the sample. The underlying assumption is that the investigator will select units that are characteristic of the population. This method can be subjected to researcher's biases and perception.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statcan.gc.ca/edu/power-pouvoir/ch13/nonprob/5214898-eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Snowball Samples:  Often used when a target population is rare. Members of the target population recruit other members of the population for the survey.
* [[Quota sampling|Quota Samples]]: The sample is designed to include a designated number of people with certain specified characteristics.  For example, 100 coffee drinkers.  This type of sampling is common in non-probability market research surveys.
* [[Convenience sample|Convenience Samples]]: The sample is composed of whatever persons can be most easily accessed to fill out the survey.

In non-probability samples the relationship between the target population and the survey sample is immeasurable and potential bias is unknowable.  Sophisticated users of non-probability survey samples tend to view the survey as an experimental condition, rather than a tool for population measurement, and examine the results for internally consistent relationships.

== Notes ==
In statistics, survey sampling describes the process of selecting a sample of elements from a target population to conduct a survey. The term "survey" may refer to many different types or techniques of observation. In survey sampling it most often involves a questionnaire used to measure the characteristics and/or attitudes of people. Different ways of contacting members of a sample once they have been selected is the subject of survey data collection. The purpose of sampling is to reduce the cost and/or the amount of work that it would take.

Survey samples can be broadly divided into two types: probability samples and non-probability samples. Probability-based samples implement a sampling plan with specified probabilities (perhaps adapted probabilities specified by an adaptive procedure). Probability-based sampling allows design-based inference about the target population. The inferences are based on a known objective probability distribution that was specified in the study protocol. Inferences from probability-based surveys may still suffer from many types of bias.

Surveys that are not based on probability sampling have greater difficulty measuring their bias or sampling error.[citation needed] Surveys based on non-probability samples often fail to represent the people in the target population.[1]

In academic and government survey research, probability sampling is a standard procedure. In the United States, the Office of Management and Budget's "List of Standards for Statistical Surveys" states that federally funded surveys must be performed:

selecting samples using generally accepted statistical methods (e.g., probabilistic methods that can provide estimates of sampling error). Any use of nonprobability sampling methods (e.g., cut-off or model-based samples) must be justified statistically and be able to measure estimation error.[2]

Besides, random sampling and design-based inference are supplemented by other statistical methods, such as model-assisted sampling and model-based sampling.[3][4]

For example, many surveys have substantial amounts of nonresponse. Even though the units are initially chosen with known probabilities, the nonresponse mechanisms are unknown. For surveys with substantial nonresponse, statisticians have proposed statistical models, with which data sets are analyzed.

Issues related to survey sampling are discussed in several sources including Salant and Dillman (1994).[5]

Synthetic channels, like natural channels, are usually characterized by a combination of [[Single-molecule experiment|single-molecule]] (e.g., [[Voltage clamp|voltage-clamp]] of [[Model lipid bilayer|planar bilayers]]&lt;ref name="Fyles ChemSocRev 2007" /&gt;) and ensemble techniques (flux in [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]]&lt;ref name="Matile Characterization 2007"&gt;{{cite book | title=The characterization of synthetic ion channels and pores | publisher=Wiley VCH |author1=Matile, Stefan |author2=Sakai, Naomi | year=2007 | isbn=978-3-527-31505-5 | doi=10.1002/9783527610273.ch11}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  The study of synthetic ion channels can potentially lead to new single-molecule sensing technologies as well as new therapeutics.

==History==

[[File:Tabushi channel.svg|thumb|right|175px|Chemical structure and expected channel forming mechanism for the first attempt at preparing a synthetic ion channel&lt;ref name="Tabushi 1982" /&gt;]]

While semi-synthetic ion channels, often based on modified [[peptide|peptidic]] channels like [[gramicidin]], had been prepared since the 1970s, the first attempt to prepare a synthetic ion channel was made in 1982 using a substituted β-[[cyclodextrin]].&lt;ref name="Tabushi 1982"&gt;{{cite journal | title=A,C,D,F-tetrasubstituted β-cyclodextrin as an artificial channel compound. |author1=Tabushi, Iwao |author2=Kuroda, Yasuhisa |author3=Yokota, Kanichi. | journal=Tetrahedron Letters | year=1982 | volume=23 | issue=44 | pages=4601–4604 | doi = 10.1016/S0040-4039(00)85664-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by gramicidin, this molecule was designed to be a barrel-shaped entity spanning a single leaflet of a [[lipid bilayer|bilayer membrane]], becoming "active" only when two molecules in opposite leaflets come together in an end-to-end fashion. While the compound does induce ion-fluxes in vesicles, the data does not unambiguously show ''channel'' formation (as opposed to other transport mechanisms; see [[Synthetic ion channels#Features and Mechanism|Mechanism]]).

Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport by such channels was first reported by two groups of investigators in 1989–1990.&lt;ref&gt;V. E. Carmichael, P. J. Dutton, T. M. Fyles, T. D. James, J. A. Swan, M. Zojaji ''Biomimetic ion transport: a functional model of a unimolecular ion channel'' J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1989, 111, 767–769.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Nakano, Q. Xie, J. V. Mallen, L. Echegoyen, G. W. Gokel ''Synthesis of a membrane-insertable, sodium cation conducting channel: kinetic analysis by dynamic sodium-23 NMR'' J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1990, 112, 1287–1289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Gokel, I. A. Carasel ''Biologically active, synthetic ion transporters'' Chem. Soc. Rev., 2007, 36, 378.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the adoption of [[voltage clamp]] technique to synthetic channel research in the early 1990s, researchers were able to observe quantized electrical activities from synthetic molecules, often considered the signature evidence for ion channels.&lt;ref name="Fyles ChemSocRev 2007" /&gt;  This led to a sustained increase in research activity over the next two decades.  In 2009, over 25 [[peer-review]]ed papers were published on the topic,&lt;ref name="Chui Channel Bibliography"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jkwchui.com/science/synthetic-ion-channel-bibliography/ | title=Synthetic Ion Channel Bibliography | year=2011 | accessdate=April 21, 2011 | author=Chui, JKW}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of comprehensive reviews are available.&lt;ref name="Matile Review Tetrahedron 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matile ChemSocRev 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matile ChemSocRev 2011" /&gt;

==Characterization and mechanisms==

[[File:Ion-transport mechanisms.svg|thumb|left|Mechanisms of transport: (L) channel, (M) ionophore/carrier, and (R) detergent]]

[[Passive transport]] of ions across a membrane can take place by three main mechanisms: by ferrying, through defects in a disrupted membrane, or through a defined trajectory; these corresponds to ''[[ionophore]]'', ''[[detergent]]'', and ''[[ion channel]]'' transporters.  While synthetic ion channel research attempts to prepare compounds that show conductance ''via'' a defined path, the elucidation of mechanism is difficult and seldom unambiguous.  The two main methods of characterization both have their drawbacks, and as a consequence, often function is defined but mechanism presumed.

===Ensemble, vesicle-based time course===
[[File:Vesicle technique.svg|thumb|right|300px|Vesicle-based assay for ion channels. Ion transporter induces an all-or-none change at the level of the individual vesicle, culminating in a macroscopic time-course that is dependent on transporter activity and concentration.]]

One line of evidence for ion transport comes from [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] examination of [[statistical ensemble]]s.  All these techniques use intact vesicles with an entrapped volume, with ion channel activities reported by different [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] methods.&lt;ref name="Matile Characterization 2007" /&gt;

In a typical case, a [[dye]] is entrapped within the population of vesicles.  This dye is selected to be respond [[Colorimetry (chemical method)|colorimetrically]] or [[Fluorescence spectroscopy|fluorometrically]] to the presence of an ion; this ion is typically absent from the inside of the vesicle but present in the outside.  Without an ion transporter, the lipid bilayer as a [[Energy barrier|kinetic barrier]] to block ion flux, and the dye remains "dark" indefinitely.

As an ion transporter allows ions on the outside to diffuse in, its addition will affect the color/fluorescence property of the dye.  By macroscopically monitoring the dye's properties over time, and controlling outside factors, the ability of a compound to act as an ion transporter can be measured.

Observing ion transport, however, does not pin down ion channel as the mechanism.  Any class of transporter can lead to the same observation, and additional corroborating evidence is usually required.  Sophisticated experiments intended to probe selectivity, gating, and other channel parameters have been developed over the past two decades and recently summarized.&lt;ref name="Matile Characterization 2007" /&gt;

===Stochastic, planar bilayer-based current traces===

[[File:Voltage-clamp-concept.svg|thumb|left|300px|Voltage-clamp experiment on planar bilayers. (A) In the absence of an ion channel, the bilayer is a resistor that has no current flow even when a potential is applied. (B) In the presence of a single, ideal ion channel molecule, a uniform step-up (whose height corresponds to the dimensions of the pore) appears. (C) Different classes of transport mechanism in theory gives rise to different profile.]]

An alternative to the ensemble-based method described above is the voltage-clamp experiment.&lt;ref name="Ashley Practical Ion Channels"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ion Channels: A Practical Approach | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Ashley, R. H. | year=1995 | location=Oxford | pages=302 | isbn=0-19-963474-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a [[voltage clamp|voltage-clamp]] experiment, two compartments of [[electrolyte]] are divided by an aperture, usually between 5-250 micrometres in diameter.  A lipid bilayer is painted across this aperture, thus electrically separating the compartments; the molecular nature can be ascertained by measuring its [[capacitance]].

Upon the addition of an (ideal) ion channel, a defined path between the two compartments is formed.  Through this pore, ions flow down the potential and electrochemical gradient rapidly (&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;/second), the maximum flux limited by the geometry and dimensions of the pore.   At some later instant the pore may close or collapse, whereupon the current returns to zero.  This open-state current, originating and amplified from a single-molecule event, is typically on the order of [[Picoampere|pA]] to [[nanoampere|nA]], with time-resolution of approx. millisecond.  Ideal or close-to-ideal events is termed "''square-tops''" in the literature, and have been considered as signature for a channel-based mechanism.

It is notable that the events observed at this scale are truly [[stochastic]] - that is, they are the result of random molecular collision and conformation changes.  As the membrane area is much larger than that of a pore, multiple copies may open and close independently of one another, giving rise to the staircase like appearance (Panel C in figure); these ideal events are often modelled as [[Markov process]]es.

==Examples==
A diverse and large pool of synthetic molecules have been reported to act as ion transporters in lipid membranes.  A selection is described here to demonstrate the breadth of feasible ''structures'' and attainable ''functions''.  Comprehensive reviews for the literature up to 2010 are available in a tripartite series.&lt;ref name="Matile Review Tetrahedron 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matile ChemSocRev 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matile ChemSocRev 2011" /&gt;

===By chemical structure===
Most (but not all; see [[Synthetic ion channels#Minimalist channels|minimalist channels]]) synthetic channels have chemical structures substantially larger than typical small molecules (molecular weights ~1-5kDa).  This originates from the need to be [[amphiphilic]], that is, have both sufficient hydrophobic portions to allow partitioning into lipid bilayer, as well as polar or charged "headgroups" to assert a defined orientation and geometry with respect to the membrane.

=====Calixarene-based=====

Ion channels containing [[calixarene]]s of ring size 3 and 4 have both been reported.  For calix[4]arene, two conformations are accessible, and examples of both ''1,3-alt'' and ''cone'' conformation have been developed.

Other architectures use peptide helices as a scaffold to attach other functionalities, such as crown ethers of different sizes.  The property of these peptide-crown channels depend strongly on the identity of the capping end-groups.

Semi-synthetic bio-hybrid channels constructed by modifications of natural ion channels had been constructed.  Leveraging modern synthetic [[organic chemistry]], these allows pinpoint modifications of existing structures to either elucidate their transport mechanisms or to graft on new functionalities.

[[File:Koert Gated Gramicidin.svg|center]]

[[Gramicidin]] and [[alamethicin]] had been popular starting points for selective modifications.&lt;ref name="AlamethicinLeucineZipper"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja011166i | title=Alamethicin−Leucine Zipper Hybrid Peptide: A Prototype for the Design of Artificial Receptors and Ion Channels |author1=Shiroh Futaki |author2=Masayuki Fukuda |author3=Masayuki Omote |author4=Kayoko Yamauchi |author5=Takeshi Yagami |author6=Mineo Niwa |author7=Yukio Sugiura  |last-author-amp=yes | journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society | year=2001 | volume=123 | issue=49 | pages=12127–12134 | doi=10.1021/ja011166i}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The above diagram illustrates one example, where a crown-ether was fixed across the mouth of the ion-passing portal.&lt;ref name="Gram-Crown Hydrid"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Crown Ether–Gramicidin Hybrid Ion Channels: Dehydration-Assisted Ion Selectivity |author1=Jochen R.

While modification of large protein channels using [[mutagenesis]] are generally considered out of the scope of ''synthetic'' channels, the demarcation is not sharp, as supramolecular or covalent bonding of cyclodextrins to alpha-hemolysin demonstrates.&lt;ref name="Bayley CD-mutant hemolysin pores 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Molecular bases of cyclodextrin adapter interactions with engineered protein nanopores |author1=Arijit Banerjee |author2=Ellina Mikhailova |author3=Stephen Cheley |author4=Li-Qun Gu |author5=Michelle Montoya |author6=Yasuo Nagaoka |author7=Eric Gouaux |author8=Hagan Bayley  |last-author-amp=yes | journal=PNAS |date=May 2010 | volume=107 | issue=18 | pages=8165–8170 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0914229107|bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.8165B | pmid=20400691 | pmc=2889592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By transport characteristics===
An ion channel can be characterized by its ''opening characteristics'', ''ion selectivity'', and ''control of flux'' (gating). Many synthetic ion channels show unique properties in one or more of these aspects.

====Opening characteristics====
[[File:Varieties of Voltage Clamp Traces.png|thumb|Sample of conductance-time records formed by synthetic ion channels in planar bilayer experiments&lt;ref name="PhD Dissertation JKWChui" /&gt;]]
An "ion-channel forming" molecule can often show multiple types of conductance activities in planar bilayer membranes.  Each of these modes of action can be characterized by their

* '''open duration''' (sub-ms---hours), related to whether the active structure is kinetically labile,
* '''unit conductance''' (pS---nS), related to the geometry of the active structure, and
* '''open probability''', a fraction related to the thermodynamic stability of that active structure relative to inactive forms.

These ''events'' are not necessarily uniform throughout their durations, and as a result a variety of shapes of conducting traces are possible.

====Ion selectivity====
The majority of synthetic ion channels follow an Eisenman I sequence (Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt;&gt; Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref name="Eisenman 1983 Ion Selectivity"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/ut6224571g261618/ | title=Ionic selectivity revisited: The role of kinetic and equilibrium processes in ion permeation through channels |author1=Eisenman, George |author2=Horn, Richard | journal=Journal of Membrane Biology | year=1983 | volume=76 | issue=3 | pages=197–225 | doi=10.1007/BF01870364}}&lt;/ref&gt; in their selectivity for [[alkali metal]] cations,&lt;ref name="Matile ChemSocRev 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VC Expt Review" /&gt; suggesting that the origin of the selectivity is governed by the difference in energy required to remove water from a fully hydrated cation.  A few synthetic channels show other patterns of ion selectivity,&lt;ref name="Gram-Crown Hydrid" /&gt; and only a single instance in which a synthetic channel following the opposite selectivity sequence (Eisenman XI; Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;&lt; Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) had been reported.&lt;ref name="MOP-18 ion channel"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Synthetic Ion Channel Based on Metal–Organic Polyhedra |author1=Jung, Minseon |author2=Kim, Hyunuk |author3=Baek, Kangkyun |author4=Kim, Kimoon | journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |date=June 2008 | volume=47 | issue=31 | pages=5755–5757 | doi=10.1002/anie.200802240 | pmid=18576447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gating====

=====Voltage response=====

[[File:IVPossibilities.svg|thumb|Modes of voltage responses in synthetic ion channels. ''A'': linear potential dependence (Ohmic). ''B'': rectifier. ''C'': exponential potential dependence]]

Most synthetic channels are [[Ohm]]ic in conductance, that is, the current passed (both individually and as an ensemble) is proportional to the potential across the membrane.  Some rare channels, however, show current-voltage characteristics that is non-linear.  Specifically, two different types of non-Ohmic conductance are known: 
# a ''rectifying'' behaviour, where current passes depends on the sign of the applied potential, and
# a ''exponential potential dependence'', where the current passed scales exponentially with the applied potential.

The former requires asymmetry with respect to the mid-plane of the lipid bilayer, and is realized often by introducing an overall molecular dipole.&lt;ref name="Push-pull rigid rod voltage-dept"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Voltage-Dependent Formation of Anion Channels by Synthetic Rigid-Rod Push–Pull β-Barrels |author1=Naomi Sakai |author2=David Houdebert |author3=Stefan Matile | journal=Chemistry: A European Journal |date=December 2002 | volume=9 | issue=1 | pages=223–232 | doi=10.1002/chem.200390016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kobuke Rectified Channel"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja010761h | title=Artificial Ion Channels Showing Rectified Current Behavior |author1=Chigusa Goto |author2=Mika Yamamura |author3=Akiharu Satake |author4=Yoshiaki Kobuke  |last-author-amp=yes | journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society | year=2001 | volume=123 | issue=49 | pages=12152–12159 | doi=10.1021/ja010761h}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fyles voltage-gated bis-macrocycle"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja972648q | title=A Voltage-Gated Ion Channel Based on a Bis-Macrocyclic Bolaamphiphile |author1=T.

They may be related to lipid ion channels, but to date their mechanism remains elusive.

=====Ligand response=====

Certain synthetic ion channels have conductances that can be modulated by additional of external chemicals.  Both up-modulation (channels are turned on by ligand) and down-modulation (channels are turned off by ligands) are known: different mechanisms, including formation of supramolecular aggregates,&lt;ref name="Matile Ligand Channel"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Ligand-Gated Synthetic Ion Channels |author1=Talukdar, Pinaki |author2=Bollot, Guillaume |author3=Mareda, Jiri |author4=Sakai, Naomi |author5=Matile, Stefan | journal=Chemistry: A European Journal |date=August 2005 | volume=11 | issue=22 | pages=6525–6532 | doi=10.1002/chem.200500516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Webb Pd++ channel"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2008/CC/b809087d | title=Palladium(II)-gated ion channels |author1=Wilson, C.

[[File:KlMuseumBatuBersurat.jpg|thumb|200px|A replica of the Terengganu Inscription Stone at the National Historical Museum in [[Kuala Lumpur]].]]

'''Terengganu Inscription Stone''' ({{lang-ms|Batu Bersurat Terengganu}}; [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: باتو برسورت ترڠݢانو) is a [[granite]] [[stele]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNESCO|2009|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; carrying [[Classical Malay]] [[inscription]] in [[Jawi script]] that was found in [[Terengganu]], [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Teeuw|1959|pp=141–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription, dated possibly to 702 [[Anno hegirae|AH]] (corresponds to 1303 [[common era|CE]]), constituted the earliest evidence of Jawi writing in the [[Malay world]] of [[Southeast Asia]], and was one of the oldest testimony to the advent of [[Islam]] as a [[state religion]] in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNESCO|2009|pp=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains the proclamation issued by a ruler of [[Terengganu]] known as ''Seri Paduka Tuan'', urging his subjects to extend and uphold [[Islam]] and providing 10 basic [[Sharia]] laws for their guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shahrizal Mahpol|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone was found half-submerged by a bank of Tersat river in [[Kuala Berang]], [[Hulu Terengganu]], in 1887 CE after the floods had receded. A Terengganuan nobleman, Pengiran Anum Engku Abdul Kadir bin Engku Besar  and his tin-prospector friend, Saiyed Husin Ghulam Al Bukhari came across the stone and brought it on a [[raft]] to [[Kuala Terengganu]] where it was presented to [[Zainal Abidin III of Terengganu|Sultan Zainal Abidin III]], and placed atop of [[Bukit Puteri]] ('Princess hill').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Razak Salleh|2010|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a meeting of the [[UNESCO]]'s International Advisory Committee (IAC) held in [[Barbados]], included the Inscribed Stone of Terengganu in a heritage list of [[Memory of the World Programme]], making it the fourth heritage recognition accorded to [[Malaysia]] after the ''[[Hikayat Hang Tuah]]'', ''[[Sejarah Melayu]]'', and the correspondence of [[Abdul Hamid Halim of Kedah|Sultan Abdul Hamid]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNESCO|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
With the [[Spread of Islam in Southeast Asia|advent of Islam into Southeast Asia]] in the 10th or 11th century, a life based on the teachings of [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]] became widespread and together with this, the use of the [[Arabic script]]. Over the time, the script was modified and adapted to suit the spoken [[Classical Malay]] language, and thus [[Jawi script]] was created. This development heralded a new age of [[literacy]], when converts to the new faith gradually replaced the previous Indian-derived scripts with Jawi, in expressing their new belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNESCO|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a testimony to the spread of Islam that originated from the [[Middle East]], the artefact offers more than just a glimpse of the life of the people of the era. It also depicted the growing Islamic culture subsumed under a set of religious laws. A concomitant feature of this historic movement was the growth of [[maritime trade]] that centred around Kuala Berang, the place where the stone was discovered. The inscribed stone alludes to regional trade that flourished in the course of [[Islamisation]], with its trading pattern and movement of peoples during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNESCO|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Islamisation of Terengganu was pursued effectively with the rise of the new way of thinking, it did not completely put an end to the old way of life. The inscribed stone still contained a number of [[Sanskrit]] terms, a memorial to [[Greater India|Southeast Asia’s Hindu past]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNESCO|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The inscribed stone was first discovered by villagers at a steep sloping riverbank of Tersat river, Kampung Buluh, [[Kuala Berang]], [[Hulu Terengganu]] in 1887, and was later brought to a nearby [[surau]], known as Surau Tok Rashid. From there, the stone was further moved to Surau Kampung Buluh. In 1902, a Terengganuan [[nobleman]], Pengiran Anum Engku Abdul Kadir bin Engku Besar and his [[Tin]]-prospector friend, Syed Husin bin Ghulam Al-Bokhari, came to Kampung Buluh. While they were at Surau Kampung Buluh to perform the [[Zuhr]] prayer, they noticed a stone with inscriptions used as a [[pedestal]] by the villagers, to step onto before entering the main prayer hall. After the prayer, they requested [[Penghulu]] Ali and his villagers to carry the stone on a raft to be brought to the capital, [[Kuala Terengganu]]. When it reached Kuala Terengganu, the stone was presented to [[Zainal Abidin III of Terengganu|Sultan Zainal Abidin III]] who ordered it to be placed atop of Bukit Puteri ('princess hill'), near to the royal palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Razak Salleh|2010|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone remained on top of the hill for 20 years, until July 1922, when the Deputy British adviser of Terengganu, Major H.S Peterson asked a Japanese photographer, N. Suzuki, to take images of the inscription and send them to C.O Bledgen to be analyzed. In 1923, British adviser to Terengganu, J.L Humphreys acquired approval from the Government of Terengganu to lend the stone to [[Raffles Museum]], [[Singapore]]. The stone remained in Singapore for 37 years until 1960, when it was relocated to the [[National Museum (Malaysia)|National Museum of Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Razak Salleh|2010|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State Government of Terengganu have been lobbying for the repatriation of the Inscribed Stone to its home state since 1979. On 12 February 1987, the Terengganu officially wrote to the administration of the National Museum, seeking permission to relocate the Inscribed Stone to their State Museum. Only in 1991, the [[Cabinet of Malaysia|Federal Cabinet]] granted approval to the request and the Inscribed Stone was returned to Terengganu. It is now displayed at the Terengganu State Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Razak Salleh|2010|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date of the inscription==
The inscription is dated, however due to damage on the lower left edge of the stone, where the year of the inscription is mentioned in the 11th lines, the date is incomplete and can be variously read as ranging from 702 to 789  [[Anno hegirae|A.H.]] (1303 to 1387 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rOw8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA514#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia, Volume 1 |page=514 |editor= Nicholas Tarling |editorlink=Nicholas Tarling |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=25 January 1993|isbn=978-0521355056 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  C.O. Blagden, who first deciphered the inscription, presented many possible dates that range from February – March 1303 CE to February 1387 CE. He doubted that the earlier date [[Rajab]], 702 AH or 1303 CE would be correct, and concluded that on general grounds he was inclined to lean towards the latest possible date.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sayyid Qudratullah Fatimi|1963|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dating was challenged by [[Syed Muhammad Naguib al-Attas]], who argued that the earlier date is the correct one through an variety of logical, mathematical, linguistic, cultural, philosophical and mystical arguments, and by attempting to reconstruct the lost part of the inscription. In his speech published by the National Museum of Malaysia, Naguib stated that the correct date of the inscription is [[Friday]], 4th of [[Rajab]], 702 [[Anno hegirae|A.H.]], that corresponds to [[Friday]], 22 February 1303 CE. His assertion is based on the following explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Syed Muhammad Naguib al-Attas|1970|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 702 AH began on 26 August 1303 CE. The day on which the [[Christian calendar]] began for that [[Islamic calendar]] was a [[Monday]] (i.e. 1 January 1303 CE was a Monday, and 237 days had elapsed in the Christian year when the Islamic year began on the 1st of [[Muharram]] (i.e. 26 August 1302 CE). [[Rajab]] is the 7th month of the Islamic calendar, and since the year 702 AH began in August 1302 CE, it therefore occurred in the month of February 1303 CE, which Christian year began on a [[Tuesday]]. Bearing in mind that the Christian year began on a Tuesday, it is found that only the 4th day of Rajab, which was the 181st day of the Islamic year 702, agrees with our computation of the date. Moreover, the 4th of Rajab confirms our computation because it was a Friday of Rajab, as mentioned in the inscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Syed Muhammad Naguib al-Attas|1970|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The stone is 89&amp;nbsp;cm in height, 53&amp;nbsp;cm in width at the top, and weight 214.8&amp;nbsp;kg. All of its four facades have inscriptions written from right to left.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNESCO|2009|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription is in Classical Malay written in the Jawi script, with dots for most of the Arabic-derived letters ( ب ، ت ، ج ، ش ، ق ، ن ، ي ) and native Jawi letters ( چ ، ݢ ، ڠ ، ڤ ), being not visible, except for the letters ( ڽ ، ض ، ف ).

==Jawi spelling system==
The spelling system of the Inscribed Stone of Terengganu has similarities with modern Jawi spelling system in a number of areas:
* Use of the Letters ''[[tāʼ marbūṭah]]'' (ة) and ''[[Taw#Arabic tāʾ|tāʼ maftūḥah]]'' (ت) - For present-day spelling, [[Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka]] has determined that the /t/ sound in Malay words should be denoted in Jawi script by ''tāʼ maftūḥah'', whereas the /t/ sound in words particularly special nouns, borrowed from Arabic should be retained in its original form with ''tāʼ marbūṭah'', except for common words that have been absorbed by and are regularly used in Malay such as ''rakyat'' (people) ( رعيت ), ''nikmat'' (grace) ( نعمت ), ''hikmat'' (wisdom) ( حکمت ) and ''berkat'' (blessing) ( برکت ). This system was established in the Inscribed Stone as per below table, where Arabic loanword which is a special noun, ''Jumaat'' (Friday) (جمعة) does not change.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aensi|2005|pp=3226–3227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}
* Use of the Letter ''[[Qoph#Arabic qāf|Qāf]]'' (ق) in final closed [[syllable]]s - In the present-day Jawi spelling system, all [[glottal stop]]s in final closed syllables of Malay words are spelt with ''qāf'', while the consonant sound /k/ in the final closed syllable of English loanwords is spelled with ''[[Kaph#Arabic kāf|kāf]]'' such as ''abstrak'' ([[abstraction|abstract]]) ( ابسترک ), ''plastik'' ([[plastic]]) ( ڤلستيک ) and ''kek'' ([[cake]]) ( كيک ). For Arabic loan words, the spelling of the source language is maintained such as for ''[[Isha prayer|isyak]]'' ( عشاء ), ''imsak'' (the time to stop [[suhoor]] slightly before [[Fajr]]) ( امساک ), ''rujuk'' (refer) ( روجوع ) and ''[[Divorce in Islam|talak]]'' (divorce) ( طلاق ). Some of the glottal stops in final closed syllables represented by letter ''qāf'' in the Inscribed Stone, are shown in the following table.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aensi|2005|p=3227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-

|}
* Use of the Letter ''Nya'' (ڽ) - Based on the consonants found on the Terengganu Inscribed Stone, there were consonant sounds in Classical Malay that were not found in the Arabic alphabet. Letters of this type include ''ca'' (چ) in ''acara'' (event) ( احارا ), ''nga'' (ڠ) in ''dengan'' (with) ( دعں ), ''pa'' (ڤ) in ''pada'' (to) ( فدا ), ''ga'' (ݢ) in ''pinggang'' (waist) ( ڡعكع ), and ''nya'' (ڽ) in ''denda-nya'' (the penalty) ( داٮداڽ ). However, a special feature of the Terengganu Stone is the use of the letter ''nya''. It is exquisitely written with three dots above it, making it the oldest known Jawi letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aensi|2005|p=3227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Hangover''''' is a series of three American comedy films created by [[Todd Phillips]]. All three films follows the misadventures of a quartet of friends (also known as "the Wolfpack") who go on their road trip to attend a bachelor party. While all of the films finds three of the four men on a mission to find their missing friend, the first two films focus on the events following a night of debauchery before a party in [[Las Vegas]] and [[Bangkok]]; whereas the [[The Hangover Part III|third and final film]] involves a road trip and a kidnapping in lieu of a bachelor party. Each film in the series focuses on how the friends try to deal with the aftermath of their antics while they are being humiliated and occasionally physically beaten up at each turn.&lt;ref name="ComingSoon" /&gt;

{{Main|The Hangover}}
''The Hangover'' tells the story of Phil Wenneck, Stu Price, and Alan Garner, who travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party to celebrate the impending marriage of their friend, Doug Billings. However, Phil, Stu, and Alan have no memory of the previous night's events and must find Doug before the wedding can take place.

Screenwriters [[Jon Lucas]] and [[Scott Moore (screenwriter)|Scott Moore]] wrote the script after hearing how a friend of executive producer Chris Bender went missing following his bachelor party in Las Vegas.&lt;ref name="Finke"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/the-real-story-of-how-the-hangover-got-made-ps-its-based-on-someone-in-hollywood |title=Real Story Of How 'Hangover' Got Made (&amp; It's Based On Someone In H'wood) |date=2009-06-08 |work=Deadline Hollywood Daily |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Lucas and Moore sold it to [[Warner Bros.]] for $2 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Diane Garrett |author2=Tatiana Siegel  |date=2007-10-04 |title=Warner weds Phillips film, Studio toasts to 'Hangover' |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117973450.html |accessdate=2009-10-28 |work=Variety |publisher=Reed Business Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; director [[Todd Phillips]] and Jeremy Garelick rewrote the script to include a tiger as well as a subplot involving a baby and a police cruiser, and also including boxer [[Mike Tyson]].&lt;ref name="Cinematical"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gilchrist |first=Todd |date=2009-06-03 |url=http://www.cinematical.com/2009/06/03/interview-the-hangover-director-todd-phillips |title=Interview: 'The Hangover' Director Todd Phillips |work=Cinematical |accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming took place in Nevada for 15 days.&lt;ref name="15Days"&gt;{{cite news |last=Spillman |first=Benjamin |url=http://www.lvrj.com/business/42251677.html |title=ShoWest movie convention optimistic about '09 |work=Las Vegas Review-Journal |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Hangover Part II'' (2011)===
{{Main|The Hangover Part II}}
In ''The Hangover Part II'', Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug travel to Thailand for Stu's wedding. After the previous film's bachelor party in Las Vegas, Stu takes no chances and opts for a safe, subdued pre-wedding brunch. However, things do not go as planned, resulting in another bad hangover with no memories of the previous night. Once again someone is lost, this time Stu's future brother-in-law, and Phil, Stu, and Alan search for him in Bangkok.

Warner Bros. hired Todd Phillips and [[Scot Armstrong]] to write a sequel to ''The Hangover'' after a trailer brought down the house at [[ShoWest]] in April 2009, two months before the film was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2009-04-05 |last=Fleming |first=Michael |title=WB gets tipsy with 'Hangover' sequel |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002135.html |work=Variety |publisher=Reed Business Information |accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal actors were cast in March 2010 to reprise their roles from the first film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2010-03-30 |last=Fleming |first=Michael |title=Warners Locks Cast Into 'Hangover' Deals |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/03/warners-locks-cast-into-hangover-deals |work=Deadline Hollywood Daily |publisher=Mail.com Media Corporation |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production began in October 2010, in [[Ontario, California]], before moving on location in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2010-10-11 |last=Goodson |first=Molly |title=First Pics: The Hangover Cast Reunites For the Sequel! |url=http://www.popsugar.com/Pictures-Hangover-2-Filming-11415073 |work=Popsugar |accessdate=2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Hangover Part III'' (2013)===
{{Main|The Hangover Part III}}
Two years after ''The Hangover Part II'', Phil, Stu, and Doug are happily living uneventful lives at home. The only member of the Wolfpack who is not content is Alan. Still lacking a sense of purpose, Alan has ditched his meds and given in to his natural impulses until the untimely death of his father forces him to finally re-evaluate his lifestyle and seek the help he needs. Phil, Stu, and Doug are there to make sure Alan takes the first step. This time, Alan gets married to Cassandra, and resigns from The Wolfpack, but things still go awry when the Wolfpack hits the road.

The '''Turkic languages''' are a [[language family]] of at least thirty-five&lt;ref&gt;Dybo A.V., ''Chronology of Türkic languages and linguistic contacts of early Türks'', Moskow, 2007, p. 766, {{cite web |url=http://altaica.narod.ru/LIBRARY/xronol_tu.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311224856/http://altaica.narod.ru/LIBRARY/xronol_tu.pdf |archivedate=2005-03-11 |df= }} (''In Russian'')&lt;/ref&gt; documented languages, spoken by the [[Turkic peoples]] of [[Eurasia]] from [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]], and [[West Asia]] all the way to [[North Asia]] (particularly in [[Siberia]]) and [[East Asia]]. The Turkic languages originated in a region of East Asia spanning Western China to Mongolia, where [[Proto-Turkic language|Proto-Turkic]] is thought to have been spoken, according to one estimate, around 2,500 years ago,&lt;ref name="Janhunen"&gt;{{cite book|title=Shared Grammaticalization: With Special Focus on the Transeurasian Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3J_6U8N2Wq8C&amp;pg=PA223&amp;lpg=PA223|first=Juha|last=Janhunen|authorlink=Juha Janhunen|editor1=Martine Irma Robbeets|editor2=Hubert Cuyckens|page=223|chapter=Personal pronouns in Core Altaic|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from where they [[Turkic migration|expanded]] to Central Asia and farther west during the first millennium.&lt;ref name="LanguagesOfTheWorld"&gt;{{cite book|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor &amp; Francis Books Ltd.|date=March 2002|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkic languages are spoken as a [[native language]] by some 170 million people, and the total number of Turkic speakers, including [[second language]] speakers, is over 200 million.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte Moser, Michael Wilhelm Weithmann, Landeskunde Türkei: Geschichte, Gesellschaft und Kultur, Buske Publishing, 2008, p.173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deutsches Orient-Institut, Orient, Vol. 41, Alfred Röper Publushing, 2000, p.611&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/iskander-pala/turkceyi-kac-kisi-konusuyor_480993.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116103056/http://www.zaman.com.tr/iskander-pala/turkceyi-kac-kisi-konusuyor_480993.html |archive-date=2014-01-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish]], spoken mainly in [[Anatolia]] and the [[Balkans]]; its native speakers account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.&lt;ref name="LanguagesOfTheWorld"/&gt;

Characteristic features of Turkish, such as [[vowel harmony]], [[agglutination]], and lack of [[grammatical gender]], are universal within the Turkic family.&lt;ref name="LanguagesOfTheWorld"/&gt; There is also a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] among the various [[Oghuz languages]], which include Turkish, [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], [[Qashqai language|Qashqai]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Balkan Gagauz Turkish]], and Oghuz-influenced [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]].&lt;ref name="Language Materials Project"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[UCLA]] International Institute, Center for World Languages|url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=67&amp;menu=004|title=Language Materials Project: Turkish|accessdate=2007-04-26|date=February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011180149/http://lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?menu=004&amp;LangID=67#|archive-date=11 October 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although methods of classification vary, the Turkic languages are usually considered to be divided equally into two branches: [[Oghur languages|Oghur]], the only surviving member of which is [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]], and [[Common Turkic languages|Common Turkic]], which includes all other Turkic languages including the Oghuz subbranch.

Turkic languages show some similarities with the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]], [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]], [[Koreanic languages|Koreanic]], and [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] languages. These similarities led some linguists to propose an [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]], though this proposal is not widely accepted. Apparent similarities with the [[Uralic languages]] family even caused these families to be regarded as one for a long time under the hypothesis of [[Ural-Altaic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Sinor, 1988, p.710&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George van DRIEM: Handbuch der Orientalistik. Volume 1 Part 10. BRILL 2001. Page 336&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Castrén,  Nordische Reisen und Forschungen. V, St.-Petersburg, 1849&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has not been sufficient evidence to conclude the existence of either of these macrofamilies, the shared characteristics between the languages being attributed presently to extensive prehistoric [[language contact]].

==Characteristics==
{{See also|Altaic languages}}
Turkic languages are [[null-subject language]]s, have [[vowel harmony]], extensive [[Agglutinative language|agglutination]] by means of [[suffix]]es and [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]], and lack of [[grammatical article]]s, [[noun class]]es, and [[grammatical gender]]. [[Subject–object–verb]] word order is universal within the family. The root of a word is basically of one, two or three consonants.

==History==
{{See also|Proto-Turkic language|Turkic peoples|Turkic migration}}
The geographical distribution of Turkic-speaking peoples across [[Eurasia]] ranges from the North-East of [[Siberia]] to Turkey in the West, since the Ottoman era (see picture in the box on the right above).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking regions.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-history===
Extensive contact took place between [[Proto-Turkic language|Proto-Turks]] and [[Proto-Mongols]] approximately during the first millennium BC; the shared cultural tradition between the two [[Eurasian nomads|Eurasian nomadic]] groups is called the "[[Turco-Mongol]]" tradition. The two groups shared a religion, [[Tengrism]], and there exists a multitude of evident loanwords between Turkic languages and [[Mongolic languages]]. Although the loans were bidirectional, today Turkic loanwords constitute the largest foreign component in Mongolian vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Turkic Loanwords in Mongol, I:The Treatment of Non-initial S, Z, Š, Č|author=Clark, Larry V.|journal=[[Central Asiatic Journal]]|date=1980|volume=24|pages=36–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of these loanwords include "lion" ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''aslan'' or ''arslan''; [[Mongolian languages|Mongolian]]: ''arslan''), "gold" (Turkish: ''altın''; Mongolian: ''altan'' or ''alt''), and "iron" (Turkish: ''demir''; Mongolian: ''tömör'').

Some lexical and extensive typological similarities between Turkic and the nearby [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] and [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] families, as well as the [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] families (all formerly widely considered to be part of the so-called [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]]) has in more recent years been instead attributed to prehistoric contact amongst the group, sometimes referred to as the [[Sprachbund#Northeast Asia|Northeast Asian sprachbund]]. A more recent (circa first millennium BCE) contact between "core Altaic" (Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic) is distinguished from this, due to the existence of definitive common words that appear to have been mostly borrowed from Turkic into Mongolic, and later from Mongolic into Tungusic, as Turkic borrowings into Mongolic significantly outnumber Mongolic borrowings into Turkic, and Turkic and Tungusic do not share any words that do not also exist in Mongolic.

[[Alexander Vovin]] (2004, 2010)&lt;ref&gt;Vovin, Alexander 2004. ‘Some Thoughts on the Origins of the Old Turkic 12-Year Animal Cycle.’ Central Asiatic Journal 48/1: 118–32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vovin, Alexander. 2010. Once Again on the Ruan-ruan Language. Ötüken’den İstanbul’a Türkçenin 1290 Yılı (720–2010) Sempozyumu From Ötüken to Istanbul, 1290 Years of Turkish (720–2010). 3–5 Aralık 2010, İstanbul / 3–5 December 2010, İstanbul: 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that [[Old Turkic]] had borrowed some words from the [[Rouran Khaganate|Ruan-ruan]] language (the language of the [[Rouran Khaganate]]), which Vovin considers to be an extinct non-Altaic language that is not related to any modern-day language.

===Early written records===
The first established records of the Turkic languages are the eighth century AD [[Orkhon inscriptions]] by the [[Göktürks]], recording the [[Old Turkic language]], which were discovered in 1889 in the [[Orkhon Valley]] in Mongolia. The ''Compendium of the Turkic Dialects'' (''[[Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk|Divânü Lügati't-Türk]]''), written during the 11th century AD by [[Mahmud al-Kashgari|Kaşgarlı Mahmud]] of the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]], constitutes an early linguistic treatment of the family. The ''Compendium'' is the first comprehensive dictionary of the Turkic languages and also includes the first known map of the Turkic speakers' geographical distribution. It mainly pertains to the [[Oghuz languages|Southwestern branch]] of the family.&lt;ref name="Soucek"&gt;{{cite book|last=Soucek|first=Svat|title=A History of Inner Asia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=March 2000|isbn=978-0-521-65169-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Codex Cumanicus]] (12th–13th centuries AD) concerning the [[Kypchak languages|Northwestern branch]] is another early linguistic manual, between the [[Kipchak language]] and [[Latin]], used by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] sent to the Western [[Cumans]] inhabiting a region corresponding to present-day [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]]. The earliest records of the language spoken by [[Volga Bulgaria|Volga Bulgars]], the parent to today's [[Chuvash language]], are dated to the 13th–14th centuries AD.

===Geographical expansion and development===
With the [[Turkic expansion]] during the [[Early Middle Ages]] (c.&amp;nbsp;6th–11th centuries AD), Turkic languages, in the course of just a few centuries, spread across [[Central Asia]], from [[Siberia]] to the [[Mediterranean]]. Various terminologies from the Turkic languages have passed into [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and to a lesser extent, [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Findley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Findley|first=Carter V.|title=The Turks in World History|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=October 2004|isbn=0-19-517726-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2018}}

==Classification==
[[File:TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.59|Relative numbers of speakers of Turkic languages]]
For centuries, the Turkic-speaking peoples have migrated extensively and intermingled continuously, and their languages have been influenced mutually and through [[language contact|contact]] with the surrounding languages, especially the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], and [[Mongolic languages]].&lt;ref name="Johanson"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Johanson, Lars|title=Discoveries on the Turkic linguistic map|publisher=Swedish Research Institute in Istanbul|year=2001|url=http://www.srii.org/admin/filer/Map.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-03-18}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has obscured the historical developments within each language and/or language group, and as a result, there exist several systems to classify the Turkic languages. The modern genetic classification schemes for Turkic are still largely indebted to Samoilovich (1922).{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The Turkic languages may be divided into six branches:&lt;ref name="historyofturkic"&gt;Lars Johanson, The History of Turkic. In Lars Johanson &amp; Éva Ágnes Csató (eds), The Turkic Languages, London, New York: Routledge, 81–125, 1998.[http://www.turkiclanguages.com/www/classification.html Classification of Turkic languages]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Common Turkic languages|Common Turkic]]
** Southwestern ([[Oghuz languages|Oghuz Turkic]])
** Northwestern ([[Kypchak languages|Kipchak Turkic]])
** Southeastern ([[Karluk languages|Karluk Turkic]])
** Northeastern ([[Siberian Turkic languages|Siberian Turkic]])
** [[Arghu-Turkic language|Arghu Turkic]]
* [[Oghur languages|Oghur Turkic]]

In this classification, [[Oghur languages|Oghur Turkic]] is also referred to as [[Lir-Turkic]], and the other branches are subsumed under the title of [[Shaz-Turkic]] or [[Common Turkic]]. It is not clear when these two major types of Turkic can be assumed to have actually diverged.&lt;ref&gt;See the main article on [[Lir-Turkic]].&lt;/ref&gt;

With less certainty, the Southwestern, Northwestern, Southeastern and Oghur groups may further be summarized as '''West Turkic''', the Northeastern, Kyrgyz-Kipchak and Arghu (Khalaj) groups as '''East Turkic'''.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue Turkic"&gt;{{cite web|author=Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.)|authorlink=Ethnologue|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition. Language Family Trees – Turkic|accessdate=2007-03-18|year=2005}} The reliability of ''Ethnologue'' lies mainly in its statistics whereas its framework for the internal classification of Turkic is still based largely on Baskakov (1962) and the collective work in Deny et al. (1959–1964). A more up to date alternative to classifying these languages on internal camparative grounds is to be found in the work of Johanson and his co-workers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically and linguistically, the languages of the Northwestern and Southeastern subgroups belong to the central Turkic languages, while the Northeastern and Khalaj languages are the so-called peripheral languages.

Hruschka, et al. (2014)&lt;ref&gt;Hruschka, Daniel J., Simon Branford, Eric D. Smith, Jon Wilkins, Andrew Meade, Mark Pagel, Tanmoy Bhattacharya (2014). Detecting Regular Sound Changes in Linguistics as Events of Concerted Evolution. Current Biology, Volume 25, Issue 1, 1-9. {{doi|10.1016/j.cub.2014.10.064}}&lt;/ref&gt; use [[computational phylogenetic]] methods to calculate a tree of Turkic based on phonological [[sound change]]s.

===Schema===
The following [[isogloss]]es are traditionally used in the classification of the Turkic languages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Самойлович|first=А. Н.|author-link=Alexander Samoylovich|year=1922|title=Некоторые дополнения к классификации турецких языков|url=http://xn--90ax2c.xn--p1ai/catalog/000200_000018_RU_NLR_INFOCOMM15_1000117889/ |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historyofturkic"/&gt;
* '''[[Rhotacism_(sound_change)|Rhotacism]]''' (or in some views, zetacism), e.g. in the last consonant of the word for "nine" *'''tokkuz'''.  This separates the Oghur branch, which exhibits /r/, from the rest of Turkic, which exhibits /z/.  In this case, rhotacism refers to the development of *-/r/, *-/z/, and *-/d/ to /r/,*-/k/,*-/kh/ in this branch.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Clark, "Chuvash", in ''The Turkic Languages'', eds. Lars Johanson &amp; Éva Ágnes Csató (London–NY: Routledge, 2006), 434–452.&lt;/ref&gt; See Antonov and Jacques (2012) &lt;ref&gt;Anton Antonov &amp; Guillaume Jacques, [https://www.academia.edu/1495118/Turkic_kumus_silver_and_the_lambdaism_vs_sigmatism_debate "Turkic kümüš ‘silver’ and the lambdaism vs sigmatism debate"], ''Turkic Languages'' 15, no. 2 (2012): 151–70.&lt;/ref&gt; on the debate concerning rhotacism and lambdacism in Turkic.
* '''Intervocalic *d''', e.g. the second consonant in the word for "foot" *hadaq
* '''Word-final -G''', e.g. in the word for "mountain" *tāg
* '''Suffix-final -G''', e.g. in the suffix *lIG, in e.g. *tāglïg
Additional isoglosses include:
* '''Preservation of word initial *h''', e.g. in the word for "foot" *hadaq. This separates Khalaj as a peripheral language.
* '''Denasalisation of palatal *ń''', e.g. in the word for "moon", *āń

==Vocabulary comparison==
{{Expert-subject|2=section|date=November 2010}}
The following is a brief comparison of [[cognate]]s among the basic vocabulary across the Turkic language family (about 60 words).

Empty cells do not necessarily imply that a particular language is lacking a word to describe the concept, but rather that the word for the concept in that language may be formed from another stem and is not a cognate with the other words in the row or that a [[loanword]] is used in its place.

Also, there may be shifts in the meaning from one language to another, and so the "Common meaning" given is only approximate. In some cases the form given is found only in some dialects of the language, or a loanword is much more common (e.g. in Turkish, the preferred word for "fire" is the Persian-derived ''ateş'', whereas the native ''od'' is dead). Forms are given in native Latin orthographies unless otherwise noted.
&lt;!--
This is a cognate table, so please do not add any non-cognates --&gt;

In Qinghai (Amdo), the Salar language has a heavy Chinese and Tibetan influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evidentials: Turkic, Iranian and Neighbouring Languages|editor1-first=Lars|editor1-last=Johanson|editor2-first=Bo|editor2-last=Utas|volume=Volume 24 of Empirical approaches to language typology|ISSN=0933-761X|edition=|year=2000|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H55NjkRtrpoC&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=58|isbn=3110161583|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although of Turkic origin, major linguistic structures have been absorbed from Chinese.  Around 20% of the vocabulary is of Chinese origin, and 10% is also of Tibetan origin. Yet the official Communist Chinese government policy deliberately covers up these influences in academic and linguistics studies, trying to emphasize the Turkic element and completely ignoring the Chinese in the Salar language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MT0VFdKklYoC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=salar+han+chinese&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XFGtTOiPJYWclgf-uInXBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=salar%20han%20chinese&amp;f=false|title=Nationalism and ethnoregional identities in China|author=William Safran|editor=William Safran|year=1998|publisher=Psychology Press|edition=illustrated|location=|page=72|isbn=0-7146-4921-X|volume=Volume 1 of Cass series—nationalism and ethnicity|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Salar language has taken loans and influence from neighboring [[varieties of Chinese]].&lt;ref name="Hickey 664"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGZedef70zAC&amp;pg=PA664&amp;dq=yellow+uyghurs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XyDPTK34N8b_lgeZxt3nCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Handbook of Language Contact|author=Raymond Hickey|editor=Raymond Hickey|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|edition=illustrated|location=|page=664|isbn=1-4051-7580-X|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is neighboring variants of Chinese which have loaned words to the Salar language.&lt;ref name="Hickey 664"/&gt; In Qinghai, many Salar men speak both the Qinghai dialect of Chinese and Salar.

{{main article|Iraqi Turkmens#Language}}

In 1980, [[Saddam Hussein]]'s government adopted a policy of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of its minorities. Due to government relocation programs, thousands of Iraqi Turkmen were relocated from their traditional homelands in northern Iraq and replaced by Arabs, in an effort to [[Arabization|Arabize]] the region.&lt;ref name="Jenkins 2008 loc=15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jenkins|2008|loc=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Iraqi Turkmen villages and towns were destroyed to make way for Arab migrants, who were promised free land and financial incentives. For example, the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'th regime]] recognised that the city of [[Kirkuk]] was historically an Iraqi Arab city and remained firmly in its cultural orientation.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the first wave of Arabization saw Arab families move from the centre and south of Iraq into Kirkuk to work in the expanding oil industry. Although the Iraqi Turkmen were not actively forced out, new Arab quarters were established in the city and the overall demographic balance of the city changed as the Arab migrations continued.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=64"/&gt;

Several presidential decrees and directives from state security and intelligence organizations indicate that the Iraqi Turkmen were a particular focus of attention during the assimilation process during the Ba'th regime. For example, the Iraqi Military Intelligence issued directive 1559 on 6 May 1980 ordering the deportation of Iraqi Turkmen officials from Kirkuk, issuing the following instructions: "identify the places where Turkmen officials are working in governmental offices [in order] to deport them to other governorates in order to disperse them and prevent them from concentrating in this governorate [Kirkuk]".&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=65"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, on 30 October 1981, the Revolution's Command Council issued decree 1391, which authorized the deportation of Iraqi Turkmen from Kiruk with paragraph 13 noting that "this directive is specially aimed at Turkmen and Kurdish officials and workers who are living in Kirkuk".&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=65"/&gt;

As primary victims of these Arabization policies, the Iraqi Turkmen suffered from land expropriation and job discrimination, and therefore would register themselves as "Arabs" in order to avoid discrimination.&lt;ref name="International Crisis Group 2006 loc=5"&gt;{{Harvnb|International Crisis Group|2006|loc=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[ethnic cleansing]] was an element of the Ba'thist policy aimed at reducing the influence of the Iraqi Turkmen in northern Iraq's Kirkuk.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=66"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Those Iraqi Turkmen who remained in cities such as Kirkuk were subject to continued assimilation policies;&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=66"/&gt; school names, neighbourhoods, villages, streets, markets and even mosques with names of Turkic origin were changed to names that emanated from the Ba'th Party or from Arab heroes.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=66"/&gt; Moreover, many Iraqi Turkmen villages and neighbourhoods in Kirkuk were simply demolished, particularly in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Anderson &amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=66"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6365">In larger school systems, a head teacher principal is often assisted by someone known as a vice-principal, deputy principal, or assistant principal. Unlike the principal, the vice-principal does not have quite the decision-making authority that the principal carries. Although they still carry nearly the same authority among students, vice-principals do not have the same power on the board. Experience as an assistant principal is often a prerequisite for advancement to a principalship.

==Job description==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Assistant principals aid the principal in the overall administration of the school. Some assistant principals hold this position for several years to prepare for advancement to principal jobs; others are career assistant principals. They are primarily responsible for scheduling student classes, ordering textbooks and supplies, and coordinating transportation, custodial, cafeteria, and other support services. They usually handle student discipline and attendance problems, social and recreational programs, and health and safety matters. They also may counsel students on personal, educational, or vocational matters. With the advent of site-based management, assistant principals are playing a greater role in ensuring the academic success of students by helping to develop new curricula, evaluating teachers, and dealing with school-community relations—responsibilities previously assumed solely by the principal. The number of assistant principals that a school employs may vary, depending on the number of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010–11 Edition |chapter=Education Administrators |chapter-url=https://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos007.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219002203/https://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos007.htm |archive-date=19 February 2012 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], [[United States Department of Labor]] |access-date=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Education==
Most schools require elementary, middle, and high school principals to have a master’s degree in education administration or leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Management/Elementary-middle-and-high-school-principals.htm#tab-4 Elementary, Middle, and High School Principals : Occupational Outlook Handbook : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Most principals also have experience as teachers. [[Master's degrees]] in educational administration are offered at a number of [[universities]] around the [[United States]] including the [[University of North Texas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unt.edu/pais/grad/geadm.htm UNT | Graduate Studies | College of Education | Masters of Educational Leadership&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ball State University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/distance/academics/programs/graduate/masters/maedadmin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215092536/http://cms.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/distance/academics/programs/graduate/masters/maedadmin |date=February 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drexel University]], [[Ashland University]], [[Northeastern University]], and the [[University of Scranton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Master of Science in Educational Administration|url=http://www.uscranton.com/online-educational-administration/|publisher=[[University of Scranton]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties==
In American schools, it is often his or her duty to handle matters such as student discipline, parent conference meetings, asset inventory and ordering, school improvement planning, bus and lunch supervision, and teacher observations. Additionally, assistant principals frequently serve as testing coordinators, training staff on procedures related to standardized assessment, as well as accounting for testing materials.{{Or|date=December 2007}} In addition to these duties, assistant principals are instructional leaders.

Most importantly however, in the event that something happens to the principal, such as an extended leave of absence, the assistant principal would act as the interim principal. Because of this, many see this position as a stepping-stone to the larger role of principal and is often used as such.  In most schools, the vice principal forgoes all teaching duties in order to address broader educational issues.

In the United Kingdom, most secondary schools have Assistant Principals (or traditionally known as Assistant Head Teachers), with the Vice-Principals (or traditionally known as Deputy Head Teachers) managing them. Their duties vary from school to school; however, usually Assistant Principals and Vice-Principals support school initiatives in maintaining standards, behavior, Key Stages 3–5, teaching and exam timetabling, inclusion, the curriculum and student learning, and overall accountability in the school. They can also carry out performance appraisals and teacher observations.  Furthermore, principals/head teachers/headmasters/headmistresses are beginning to have more autonomy on how they will structure their school's senior leadership team and what each member's role will be. These additional roles that are found in English secondary schools can lead to senior leadership/administrative teams to be as large as 8–12 people, depending on the school's size and its demographics (e.g., Head Teacher, 2–4 Deputy Head Teachers, 3–8 Assistant Head Teachers). In contrast to the US, most Assistant Head Teachers and Deputy Head Teachers teach 1–2 courses on top of their administrative duties.

[[File:Great Grand Master Han.jpg|thumb|Grand Master Han Bong-Ki giving a lecture at the World Won Hwa Do Festival 1999]]
'''Won Hwa Do'''(원화도) is a traditional [[Korean martial arts|Korean martial art]], founded in 1972 by [[Bong-Ki Han]]. The name in Korean (Hangul) means "The Way of Circular Harmony" (Won = Circle, Hwa = Harmony, Do = Way). The basis of the art lies in circular movement by effectively utilizing full 360° rotations of the human body motion. This helps in conserving energy and reducing the risk of injury on the practitioner's joints often caused by use of linear force and impact. Won Hwa Do is often compared to [[hapkido]] and [[Taekkyeon]] which are also national martial arts of Korea. Although similar in several aspects, Won Hwa Do's Ha-Dan/Sang-Dan Hoe-Jeon-Gong-Bang (하단/상단 회전공방) techniques are a unique trademark which is not shared by the other Korean martial arts. Ha-Dan Hoe-Jeon- Gong-Bang has the practitioner rotating arms in a forward motion and Sang-Dan has them rotating it in a backward motion. These two form the bases of strikes, throws, blocks, counters, submissions and kicks in its diverse self-defense system and are the most fundamental and basic practice of Won Hwa Do.
The uniform pattern is also unique in that it contains diamond shaped patterns with green and maroon lines painted or sewn across it. Its belt system does not follow the traditional Japanese black belt curriculum and its forms ([[kata]]) are quite short in comparison to [[karate]], [[taekwondo]] and hapkido. Won Hwa Do is a very unorthodox martial art as demonstrated by its breaking away from these norms but takes pride in having its own unique standard.

== History ==
=== Founding ===
[[File:Training in the early days.jpg|thumb|Cho and Han in the very beginning.]]
Founded in 1972 by Bong-Ki Han Won Hwa Do's origins lie in traditional Korean prayer and dance. The prayer-like movements are known as Bison(비손) which has the practitioner moving his hands in a circular path against one another as if turning a wheel.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mardb.com/wonhwado/ |title=WonHwaDo &amp;#124; Martial Arts Database |website=Mardb.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea represents the rotating of Yin Yang within a person's mind and body thereby bringing peace and harmony to him/her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wonhwado.org/about |title=WonHwaDo.org |website=wonhwado.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Won Hwa Do at one point had a team that performed Won Hwa Do dance alongside the Famous [[Little Angels Children's Folk Ballet of Korea|Little Angels Children's Folk Ballet]] of South Korea.

Han was a monk in a temple for a short while. It is assumed that his lifestyle from these times were a deep influence on how he chose to create Won Hwa Do's techniques.
Ik-Hun Cho assisted Bong-Ki Han in the early days using experiences from his days as a master of other Korean martial arts. Many old photographs show the two of them travelling around Korea spreading WonHwaDo.

===  Central Training Center (Chilwon Dojang) ===
Bong-Ki Han and his main disciples established and built the Central Training center (Chilwon dojang) in 1994. There he held many workshops, seminars and even 100 day training camps. 100 day training camps were a common tradition for those training to attain the rank of Maroon Belt (Instructor) and beyond.
In 1998 The World Won Hwa Do Festival was held in which people from all over the Asia and Europe participated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wonhwado.homepage.tonline.de/PDF/Presse/bis_2000/1998_Bericht_2_Leadership_Conference.pdf] {{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow up festival was held in the following year of 1999. It was from this Festival that Han sent European masters to back pioneer WonHwaDo in their homeland countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wonhwado.homepage.t-online.de/PDF/Presse/bis_2000/1999_Bericht_2_Welt_Festival_1999.pdf |format=PDF |title=WonHwaDo Deutschland |website=Wonhwado.homepage.t-online.de |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chilwon in Masan, [[Gyeongsang Province|GyeongSangDo]] Province was a forested area of the countryside of South Korea that Won Hwa Do used for all of its major events and training workshops. However, in 2004 the Chilwon dojang would close its doors and the WWF(World Won Hwa Do Federation) would move its headquarters to Seoul.

=== The World Won Hwa Do Federation ===
[[File:세계원화도연맹.jpg|thumb|World Won Hwa Do Federation established in 2003.]]
In 2003 The World Won Hwa Do Federation(세계원화도연맹) was officially recognized and supported by the Korean Government as a national Martial Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=003&amp;aid=0002070199 |title=한성디지털大, 세계원화도연맹과 산학협력 체결 : 네이버 뉴스 |language=ko |website=News.naver.com |date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Won Hwa Do during this time became well established in European countries such as Germany, Slovakia, Lithuania and the United Kingdom.
Won Hwa Do also began to grow steadily in Japan as well during this period.
In the year 2004, [[Jeonju|Jeon Ju]](전주) Won Hwa Do training center was established by Ryu Jae Nam(류재남).
After Bong-Ki Han's died in 2010 he left leadership of the World Won Hwa Do Federation to his son and other leaders.
Shortly following his passing the Seoul Headquarters closed down and the training center in Jeon Ju became the WWF Headquarters.&lt;ref name="원화도 세계무술소개 &amp;#124; 충주세계무술축제"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martialarts.or.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=malist&amp;wr_id=10 |title=원화도 &gt; 세계무술소개 &amp;#124; 충주세계무술축제 |website=Martialarts.or.kr |date= |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since Bong-Ki Han]s passing Ik-Hun Cho is the only person to attain the rank of Great Grand Master(Gold stripe). He helped develop, pioneer and create the many techniques of Won Hwa Do's diverse GongBang(공방) system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.naver.com/kt2112?Redirect=Log&amp;logNo=100029441867 |title=cheng : 네이버 블로그 |website=Blog.naver.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International development ===
Japan's Won Hwa Do headquarters are in [[Okayama]] prefecture but dojangs also exist in several locations across the country such as [[Nagoya]] and [[Osaka]]. Across Europe, several countries remain active albeit in a much smaller capacity than the early years of 2000. [[Austria]], [[Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wonhwado.de/schulen.html |title=Schulen &amp; Dojangs |website=Wonhwado.de |date=2015-10-27 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slovakia]], [[England]], [[Lithuania]] are among the few countries that still teach and practice Won Hwa Do. In order to help accelerate the growth of Wonhwado internationally,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wonhwado.de/PDF/Presse/2004/Mitteilungsblatt_BadLausick_19_2004.pdf |format=PDF |title=Angebote der Volkshochschule |website=Wonhwado.de |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bong-Ki Han sent his disciples and students abroad to learn English whilst pioneering the art in those countries. Germany, Slovakia and England are a direct by-product of this time. Germany currently has 3 different dojangs with the headquarters being in Leipzig.

== Philosophy ==
Circular motion to harmonise with the Universe, Heaven, People, Nature. The concept is based around the idea that all straight lines are destined to begin and end whilst circular force and motion naturally flows without ceasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Song|first1=Hugo|title=Mr|url=http://wonhwado.org/about/philosophy|website=www.wonhwado.org|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques and curriculum ==
Won Hwa Do is considered to be a diverse and versatile martial art. For example, it employs grappling techniques for throwing and locking submissions but also has striking with punches and kicks. However, all of these diverse techniques still revolve around the fundamental principles of circular motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtpCQT3tNIE&amp;t=19s |title=Remembering Grand Master Han Bong-Ki (원화도) (圓和道) English Subtiles |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2016-09-01 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Won Hwa Do has a term for its techniques known as 'Gongbang'(공방). The [[Hangul]] (Korean characters) for Gong(공) means offense whilst the Hangul for Bang(방)&lt;ref name="원화도 세계무술소개 &amp;#124; 충주세계무술축제"/&gt; means defense. Won Hwa Do teaches to practice offense and defense simultaneously in one movement through the use of circular motion.
Although seemingly peaceful, meditative and harmless in appearance the force from the circular Hadan (forward circular) strike carries a formidable impact on the target. The force comes from the theory of infusing pushing and pulling into one circular strike as if striking with a ball and chain flail weapon swinging at the end of a handle. Cho Ik Hun teaches that force and technique in the Hadan strike comes not from observation and talent but pure and patient practice of the basic Hadan circular movement for many years. He also emphasizes the importance of breathing and core hip strength in mastering the technique.

=== Belt structure ===
Won Hwa Do has a different belt system to other martial arts like [[judo]], karate, taekwondo and hapkido. For example, usually in traditional martial arts like Karate the [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] is the symbol of an instructor or high level practitioner. However, in Won Hwa Do a person of high rank and skill wears a maroon-colored belt.
The reason behind Won Hwa Do's choice of colors is that Karate's black system was rooted in Japan's martial arts history whereas Won Hwa Do chooses to base its system on Korea's [[Joseon|Joseon Dynasty]] era. For example, common folk wore plain white Han boks (Korean traditional clothing) whilst captains and commanders of the military wore blue and red. Generals and Politicians would often wear purple or maroon-colored [[Hanbok|Han boks]] with blue, green and golden patterns.&lt;ref name="Belt-structure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wonhwado.org/about/belt-system |title=WonHwaDo belt system |website=wonhwado.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although depending on the country system varies, the system displayed above is the general standard.

Han and Cho prefer being called by the title of simply 'Grand Master' or Teacher (seonsaengnim, 선생님) as they deem 'Great Grand Master' too long-winded.

After the death of Bong-Ki Han, Ik-Hun Cho is the only one to hold the rank of Maroon (purple) gold Grandmaster belt.
