{{for|African-American religion in the United States|Religion in Black America}}

'''Afro-American religion''' (also known as '''African diasporic religions''') are a number of related [[religion]]s that developed in the [[Americas]] in various nations of [[Latin America]], the [[Caribbean]], and the [[southern United States]]. They derive from [[traditional African religion]]s with some influence from other religious traditions, notably [[Christianity]].

== Characteristics ==
Afro-American religions involve [[veneration of the dead]], and include a [[creator deity]] along with a [[pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] of divine [[spirit]]s such as the [[Orisha]], [[Loa]], [[Nkisi]], and [[Alusi]], among others. In addition to the [[religious syncretism]] of these various African traditions, many also incorporate elements of [[Folk Catholicism]], [[Native American religion]], [[Spiritism]], [[Spiritualism]] and [[European folklore]].

The '''Algerian Family Code''' ({{lang-fr|'''Code de Famille'''}}, {{lang-ar|'''قانون الأسرة'''}}), enacted on June 9, 1984, specifies the laws relating to familial relations in Algeria. It includes strong elements of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] which have brought it praise from [[Islamist]]s and condemnation from [[secularist]]s and [[feminist]]s.

==History==
{{Main|History of Algeria|Women and Islam}}
Its critics particularly focus on its implications for [[women]] (who have less right to divorce than men, and who receive smaller shares of inheritance) and sometimes for [[apostate]]s (who are disinherited, and whose marriages may be nullified.) President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] has declared that it must be revised &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cherfaoui|first=Zine|title=Bouteflika favorable à la révision du code de la famille|url=http://www.algerie-dz.com/article1172.html|newspaper=El Watan|date=11 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the spirit of universal [[human rights]] and Islamic law. Reactions were mixed. Lachhab of the Islamist [[Movement for National Reform|El Islah]] party declared that "We oppose these amendments which are contrary to Sharia, and thus to article 2 of the Constitution," whereas Nouria Hafsi of the pro-government [[National Rally for Democracy (Algeria)|RND]] declared "These timid amendments put forward a modern reading of the Sharia; the rights of women will finally be recognized by law. As of early 2005 it has not been changed.

==Marriage==
[[Marriage]] is defined as a legal contract between a man and a woman. The legal age of marriage is 21 for a man, 18 for a woman; judges may in special cases allow earlier marriage. A man may marry up to four wives; if so, he must treat them equally and inform them in advance, and they may demand a divorce. Marriage requires the consent of both parties and a gift by the groom of a [[dowry]] to the bride, as well as the presence of the bride's father or guardian (''wali'') and of two witnesses.  The father of the bride may block the marriage, although her guardian may not.  The marriage must be registered before a notary or legal functionary. Marriage is forbidden between close relatives by descent, marriage, or nursing: thus a man may not marry his mother, daughter, sister, aunt, niece, mother-in-law, daughter-in-law, stepmother-in-law, or stepdaughter-in-law, nor may he marry anyone who suckled from the same woman as he did, or from whom he suckled.  A man may not be married to two sisters simultaneously. Marriage is also forbidden between a couple who have divorced each other for the third time, unless the wife has since been married to someone else. A [[Muslim]] woman may not marry a non-Muslim man, and a marriage may be annulled on the grounds of the spouse's apostasy. A husband is required to provide for his wife to the best of his abilities, and to treat his wives equally if he marries more than one. A wife is required to obey her husband and respect him as head of the family, to bring up and nurse his children, and to respect his parents and relatives.   A wife has the right to visit her parents and to receive visits from them, and has rights over her own property.
*Adoption is forbidden: a child may be brought up as part of the family, but must be considered the child of its natural parents, that is what Islamic law calls [[Kafala]].

==Divorce==
The husband may [[divorce]] his wife at will; if he is judged to have abused this privilege, his wife may be awarded damages, and he must provide for his divorced wife and her children if she has no family to go to, unless she had previously divorced or was guilty of immorality.  The wife may request a divorce if any of the following apply:
**her husband has failed to provide for her;
**her husband is [[impotent]];
**her husband has refused to have sex with her for over 4 months;
**her husband has been condemned to a dishonorable imprisonment of over a year's length;
**her husband has been absent for over a year without a good reason;
**her husband has failed to fulfill his legal duties towards her;
**her husband is guilty of grave immorality.
If she obtains the divorce, she must pay reparations not to exceed the value of the dowry, and may not remarry until three [[menstrual periods]] have elapsed, or, if pregnant, until her baby's birth. In case of the father's absence or of divorce, [[child custody|custody]] of the child goes to his mother, or failing that his maternal grandmother or aunt, or failing that his father or paternal grandfather, or some other relative. A child's guardian must bring the child up in the religion of the child's father. A child brought up by a guardian attains independence at 10 (if male), or at marriage (if female).

==Abolition==
In February 2011, President [[Bouteflika]] announced the fall of the State of Urgency in Algeria, assuring the abolition of the Code of the family in the near future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7567">[[Image:O3m AryaSamaj.PNG|thumb|AUM or OM is considered by the Arya Samaj to be the highest and most proper name of God.]]

The '''[[Arya Samaj]]''' was the first religious, cultural and educational [[Indians in Fiji|Fiji Indian]] organisation established in [[Fiji]]. From its inception, in 1904, it attracted the young, educated and progressive [[Hindus]] into its fold. During the first three decades of the twentieth century, it was the sole voice of the [[India]]n community in Fiji, and as Fiji Indians won political rights, it was not surprising that first Indian members of the [[Legislative Council of Fiji|Legislative Council]] were all Arya Samajis. The influence of Arya Samaj over the Indians in Fiji gradually waned as other organisations representing Indians were established but it remained the dominant force in politics until 1959. The modern day Arya Samaj in Fiji still speaks out on issues affecting its members and its activities are visible through the numerous educational institutions that it manages.

== History of Arya Samaj in Fiji ==
As far back as 1893, learning centres had been established by small groups of people who had organised themselves into Samajs. With the arrival of Shiu Datt Sharma from [[India]], in 1902, a temple was established in Samabula, near Suva, which also acted as a school attended by about 60 boys and girls.

A person who had a profound influence on the establishment of Arya Samaj in Fiji was a 22-year-old man from Punjab, Behari Lal, who while on his way to [[Argentina]] via [[Australia]], stopped over in Fiji. He found employment at the [[Tamanua (Navua) Sugar Mill|Navua Sugar Mill]], but visited Suva regularly where people interested in the teachings of [[Swami Dayananda Saraswati|Swami Dayanand Saraswati]] gathered at the residence of Mangal Singh. Lal had a copy of the [[Satyarth Prakash]] in the [[Urdu]] language from which he read and explained portions to the congregation every Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vidyalankar |first= Nardev|authorlink= |author2=Manohar Somera|title= Arya Samaj and Indians abroad|year=1975 |publisher=Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha |location= New Delhi, India|isbn= | pages = 129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was this small group of Fiji Indians who included Mangal Singh, Gaji Pratap Singh, Nanku Sonar, Bihari Lal, Shiu Datt Sharma, Basdeo Rai, Inayat Hussein, Indra Narayan and Tikaram Verma, who met in Samabula on 25 December 1904 to form the Arya Samaj of Fiji. This was due to their desire to maintain their heritage and provide a platform for lifting their living standard and the inspiration they received from the teaching of [[Swami Dayananda Saraswati|Swami Dayanand Saraswati]], the founder of Arya Samaj.

== Early activities of Arya Samaj ==
Arya Samaj’s work in Fiji received a boost with the arrival of Arya Samaj Missionary from India, Swami Ram Manoharanand Saraswati, who arrived in Fiji from [[Burma]] in 1913. [[Totaram Sanadhya]], although himself a ''[[Sanatani]]'', has written about the early contribution of Arya Samaj to providing education and religious education in Fiji and asked for them to send more educators to Fiji.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
An Arya Samaji gentleman by the name of Ram Manoharanand Sarasvati went and he preached there, therefore these words of thanks. There is a very great need for this sort of religious instructor there, who knows Vedic principles and knows English as well.... We know that Arya Samaj is doing a lot of work, but aren't these givers of aid to the world, the Arya Samaj, able to send one more religious instructor to Fiji, for the benefit of our foreign-dwelling brothers? &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanadhya |first= Totaram|authorlink= |title=My twenty-one years in the Fiji Islands (English translation) |year=1991 |publisher= Fiji Museum|location=SUva, Fiji |isbn= |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Arya Samaj appealed to those who wanted to build a revitalised [[Hinduism]] in Fiji suitable to the local conditions. [[Badri Maharaj]], who built the first school for Indians in Fiji in 1898 was an Arya Samaji and so was the first Indian Lawyer to arrive in Fiji, [[Manilal Doctor]], who had been involved in Arya Samaj in [[Mauritius]] and believed that Arya Samaj was the best sect for the individualized Indians in Fiji.  The first school was built by Arya Samaj in Fiji was the [[Gurukul Primary School]] in Saweni, [[Lautoka]] in 1918.

== Educational and Religious Activities ==
Following the establishment of this school a great renaissance took place amongst Indo-Fijians to educate their children. This was supported by the arrival from India of a number of teachers, some of whom were [[Ami Chandra]], [[Kundan Singh Kush]] and [[K. B. Singh|Kunwar Bachint Singh]]. Between 1926 and 1929 more than 100 Indo-Fijian boys and girls were sent to India to study at various Arya Samaj institutions. In the early thirties, Arya Samaj was the best organised of any Indo-Fijian organisation. It also had as its leader, [[Vishnu Deo]] and the only [[Hindi]] language newspaper in Fiji, ''[[Fiji Samachar]]''. The Arya Samaj aggressively promoted its teaching and openly attempted to gain converts from [[Muslim]]s. Arya Samaj activities in Fiji reached a peak with the arrival of another missionary, [[Shri Krishna Sharma]] from India. Conflict soon developed with [[Christianity in India|Indian Christian]]s, [[Islam|Muslim]]s, [[South India]]ns and even ''[[Sanatana Dharma|Sanatani]]s'' who had initially supported the Arya Samaj through Hindu Sangsthans. There were debates on religious issues, but when Vishnu Deo was convicted and fined for an article in the ''Fiji Samachar'', things quietened down.

== Educational and Political Leadership in Fiji ==
The Arya Samaj, henceforth, concentrated on its educational activities and built numerous educational institutions. Arya Samajis continued to provide leadership to the Indo-Fijians and until the 1960s most Indo-Fijian leaders were either ''Arya Samajis'' or those with close links to the Arya Samaj in Fiji. Some who served on the [[Legislative Council of Fiji|Legislative Council]] were [[Badri Maharaj]], [[Vishnu Deo]], [[Parmanand Singh]], [[Chattur Singh]], [[Ayodhya Prasad]], [[Ami Chandra]], [[K. B. Singh]] and [[Vijay R. Singh]]. Some ''Arya Samaji'' members of Parliament since independence have been Vijay R. Singh, Dr. Ganesh Chand, [[Kamlesh Arya|Kamlesh Kumar Arya]], [[Surendra Prasad]], [[Anand Singh]] and [[Davendra Singh]].

== Arya Samaj of Fiji spreads Overseas ==
As Indo-Fijians have migrated overseas, they have taken their religion and culture with them Consequently, Arya Samajs have been established in a number of countries by former Indo-Fijians.  The following are links to the Web Sites of some of these:

In the [[Church of Scientology]], '''auditing''' is a process wherein the auditor takes an individual, known as a "preclear", through times in their life and gets rid of any hold negative situations have on them. Auditing began as an integral part of the [[Dianetics]] movement and has since, with the [[E-meter]], become a core practice in [[Scientology]]. Auditing is defined by the Church as "the application of [[Dianetics]] or [[Scientology]] processes and procedures to someone by a trained auditor. One formal definition of auditing is the action of asking a person a question (which he can understand and answer), getting an answer to that question and acknowledging him or her for that answer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smi.org/features/glossary/ |title=Scientology glossary |accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditing is considered "a technical measure," that according to the Church, "lifts the burdened individual, the 'preclear,' from a level of spiritual distress to a level of insight and inner self-realization." The process is meant to bring the individual to clear status.

According to scholar Eric Roux, auditing is one of the "core practices" of Scientology. The primary aim of auditing in Scientology doctrine is to rediscover an individual's natural abilities, while understanding that one is a spiritual being.

Some auditing actions use commands, for example "Recall a time you knew you understood someone," and some auditing actions use questions such as, "What are you willing for me to talk to others about?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=Mini List of Grade 0-IV Processes|journal=HCO Bulletin 8 September 1978RB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In the context of Dianetics or Scientology, auditing is an activity where an auditor, trained in the task of communication, listens and gives auditing commands to a subject, who is referred to as a "preclear", or more often as a "pc". While auditing sessions are confidential, the notes taken by the auditor during auditing sessions. Preclears never see their own pc folders.Scientology does not agree with evaluation of a PC. Having a pc observe their own folder might bring an evaluation into his/her universe making it harder for him/her to spot the actual core of a current situation. 

Auditing involves the use of "processes," which are sets of questions asked or directions given by an auditor. When the specific objective of any one process is achieved, the process is ended and another can then be started. Through auditing, the subjects are said to free themselves from barriers that inhibit their natural abilities. Outlining the auditing process, Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] explained:
{{quotation|Charge is that which prevents the pc from thinking on a subject. Prevents him from thinking on a subject or getting rid of a subject or approaching a subject. Sum it up to handling a subject. Charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=3DXX Assessment|journal=Tape 6202C08|date=8 Feb 1962|series=SHSBC 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Scientologists the person being audited is completely aware of everything that happens and becomes even more alert as auditing progresses. As Hubbard wrote,

{{quotation |One of the great truths of Scientology is that INCREASED AWARENESS IS THE ONLY FACTOR WHICH OFFERS ANY ROAD OUT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=The Big Auditing Problem|journal=Professional Auditor's Bulletin|date=1 Sep 1957|series=PAB 119}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The auditor is obliged by the Church's doctrine to maintain a strict code of conduct, called the Auditor's Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=The Auditor's Code 1954|journal=Professional Auditor's Bulletin (PAB 38)|date=29 October 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditing is said to be successful only when the auditor conducts himself in accordance with the Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=Questionable Auditing|journal=HCO Bulletin 11 July 1982, Iss II}}&lt;/ref&gt; A violation of the Auditor's Code is considered a high crime under Scientology policy.

The code outlines a series of 29 promises, which include pledges such as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/auditing/pg004a.html website: Scientology.org / THE AUDITOR'S CODE]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Not to evaluate for the preclear or tell him what he should think about his case in session
* Not to invalidate the preclear's case or gains in or out of session
* Never to use the secrets of a preclear divulged in session for punishment or personal gain

The main intention of an auditing session is to remove "charted incidents" that have caused trauma, which are believed in Scientology to be stored in the reactive mind. These incidents must then be eliminated for proper functioning, in accordance with the Church's belief.&lt;ref name="Significance"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15685276-12341408 |title=The Significance of Rituals in Scientology: A Brief Overview and a Few Examples |journal=Numen |year=2016 |last=Rothstein |first=Mikael |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=54–70 |accessdate=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the religion researcher Hugh B. Urban, both current Scientologists and people who have become disaffected with Scientology generally agree that auditing can trigger personal insights and cause dramatic changes in one's psychological state.&lt;ref name=Urban47&gt;[[#Urban2011|Urban (2011)]], p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The recalling and expression of old hurts in response to the auditor's questions may feel like an unburdening, followed by a period of elation, as though a weight has been lifted off the practitioner's shoulders.&lt;ref name=Urban47 /&gt;

Scientology makes a distinction between auditors, those who practice auditing, and publics, those who receive the prosses but do not receive training to perform the practice on others until they wish to do so. Auditors are deemed in Scientology as higher state individuals as they are regarded as more focused in achieving the goals of the religion, or "clearing the planet," in Scientological terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=James R.|title=Scientology|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-533149-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, auditing techniques "began to focus on the goal of exteriorizing the thetan" in order to provide one with a complete awareness of one's spiritual nature. According to Eric Roux, "many auditing techniques were designed towards gaining spiritual freedom by way of increasing communication of the thetan with the physical universe, in order to develop freedom from the physical universe." Scientologists believe that the thetan "can exist separately from the body, with a full awareness of being out of it, a phenomenon which Scientologists call 'exteriorization.' (Hubbard 1952)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roux |first1=Eric |url=https://www.routledge.com/New-Religious-Movements-and-Counselling-Academic-Professional-and-Personal/Harvey-Steidinger-Beckford/p/book/9781472472717 |title=New Religious Movements and Counselling: Academic, Professional and Personal Perspectives |chapter=Scientology auditing: Pastoral counselling or a religious path to total spiritual freedom |editor-last=Harvey |editor-first=Sarah |editor2-last=Stedinger |editor2-first=Silke |editor3-last=Beckford |editor3-first=James A. |publisher=Routledge |year=2018 |accessdate=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==E-meter==
{{Main|E-meter}}
[[File:Scientology e meter blue.jpg|thumb|Mark Super VII Quantum E-meter]]
Most auditing sessions employ a device called the Hubbard Electropsychometer or E-meter. This device is a custom [[electrodermal activity]] measurement device. It measures changes in the [[electrical resistance]] of the [[Clear (Scientology)|preclear]] by passing a small electric current (typically in the range from 50 µA to 120 µA) through the preclear's body by means of a pair of [[tin]]-plated tubes originally much like empty soup cans, attached to the meter by wires and held by the preclear during auditing. These changes in electrical resistance are believed by Scientologists to be a reliable and a precise indication of changes in the [[reactive mind]] of the preclear.

According to Scientologist doctrine, the development of the E-meter enabled auditing techniques and made it more precise. Later, the E-meter was used to identify which processes should (and could) be run&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=Unreading Questions and Items|journal=HCO Bulletin 27 May 1970|volume=VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; and equally crucially, to determine when to stop running a particular action. As a repair tool, the E-meter reacts to a list of possible difficulties and relevant phrases called out by the auditor, helping to guide the auditor to the difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=Auditing by Lists Revised|journal=HCO Bulletin 3 July 1971|volume=VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard clarified how the E-Meter should be used in conjunction with auditing:

{{quotation|'''HCO Bulletin 3 December 1978'''
One of the governing laws of auditing is that you don't run unreading items. It doesn't matter what you are auditing. You don't run unreading items. And you don't run unreading flows. You don't run an unreading anything. Ever. For any reason.

Auditing is aimed at reactivity. You run what reacts on the meter ''because'' it reacts and is therefore part of the reactive mind. A read means there is charge present and available to run. Running ''reading'' items, flows and questions is the only way to make a pc better. This is our purpose in auditing.
::: '''L Ron Hubbard'''}}

Hubbard claimed that the device also has such sensitivity that it can measure whether or not [[fruit]]s can experience pain, claiming in 1968 that [[tomatoes]] "scream when sliced."&lt;ref name="tomatoes"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.life.com/image/76796742/in-gallery/25371 |title=30 Dumb Inventions |publisher=''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' |date=1968-01-01 |accessdate=2009-10-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091031093818/http://www.life.com/image/76796742/in-gallery/25371| archivedate= 31 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tomatoes2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonyortega.org/2013/02/02/scientology-mythbusting-with-jon-atack-the-tomato-photo/ |title=Scientology Mythbusting with Jon Atack: The Tomato Photo! |publisher=tonyortega.org |date=2013-02-02 |accessdate=2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=Paulette|title=The Scandal of Scientology|date=1971|publisher=[[Belmont/Tower]]; Mass market edition|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/cooper/sos-18.html|chapter=Chapter 18: The E-Meter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology teaches that individuals are immortal souls or spirits (called ''[[thetans]]'' by Scientology) and are not limited to a single lifetime. The E-meter is believed to aid the auditor in locating subliminal memories ("[[engram (Dianetics)|engram]]s", "[[Incident (Scientology)|incidents]]", and "[[Implant (Scientology)|implants]]") of past events in a thetan's current life and in previous ones. In such Scientology publications as ''[[Have You Lived Before This Life]]'', Hubbard wrote about [[Reincarnation#Scientology|past life experiences]] dating back billions and even trillions of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=James R. |title=Scientology |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |accessdate=2016-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When various foundations of Dianetics were formed in the 1950s, auditing sessions were a hybrid of confession, counseling and psychotherapy. According to Passas and Castillo, the e-meter was believed to be used to "disclose truth to the individual who is being processed and thus free him spiritually."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Scientology and its 'clear' business |journal=Behavioral Sciences &amp; the Law |year=1992 |last=Passas |first=Nikos |last2=Castillo |first2=Manuel Escamilla |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=103–116 |doi=10.1002/bsl.2370100110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bridge ==

Back in 1950, at the very end of his book, ''Dianetics: the Modern Science of Mental Health'', Hubbard talks about a bridge from one plateau of existence to another, higher plateau.

Hubbard wanted to make the processes structured in such a way that one could take a new person and walk them through standardized steps, one after another, to cross this hypothesized "Bridge". This intent led to the development of the Standard Operating Procedure for Theta Clearing by 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=Procedures for Theta Clearing|journal=Journal of Scientology|date=Nov 1952|issue= 6-G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standard Operating Procedure for the Church of Scientology changed rapidly, meaning that when somebody was trained as an auditor they were almost immediately out of date with the latest procedures.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In 1970, the Standard Operating Procedure was used to create the Classification and Gradation Chart. This chart, first published in 1965 and revised in 1966, 1968 and 1969, had the steps of the bridge plotted out from a beginner at the bottom to the highest states attainable at the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=Programming of Cases|journal=HCO Bulletin 12 June 1970|series=C/S series 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The left-hand side of the chart contains auditor skill levels, while the right-hand side contains pre-clear grades and OT (Operating Thetan) levels.

The 1970 version of the chart is entitled "Classification Gradation and Awareness Chart of Levels and Certificates". By 1974 the above title had slipped down a little to make way for "THE BRIDGE" as the top line, with "TO A NEW WORLD" underneath in a smaller font. A more recent (circa 2016) chart is entitled "THE BRIDGE TO TOTAL FREEDOM" and subtitled "SCIENTOLOGY CLASSIFICATION GRADATION AND AWARENESS CHART."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Bridge in Scientology|url=http://www.scientology.org/faq/background-and-basic-principles/what-is-the-bridge-in-scientology.html|website=Scientology|publisher=Church of Scientology International|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
Each Grade on the Bridge has a list of processes that auditors should run. Below are sample commands from processes run in each Grade.

:'''ARC Straightwire:''' "Recall a communication." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=Expanded ARC Straightwire Grade Process Checklist|journal=HCO Bulletin 14 Nov 1987|issue= I}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;!-- #4 --&gt;
:'''Grade 0:''' "Recall a place from which you have communicated to another." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=Expanded Grade 0 Process Checklist|journal=HCO Bulletin 14 Nov 1987|issue= II}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!-- #3 --&gt;
:'''Grade I:''' "Recall a problem you have had with another." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=Expanded Grade I Process Checklist|journal=HCO Bulletin 14 Nov 1987|issue= III}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!-- #28 --&gt;
:'''Grade II:''' "Recall a secret." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=Expanded Grade II Process Checklist|journal=HCO Bulletin 14 Nov 1987|issue= IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!-- #1 --&gt;
:'''Grade III:''' "Can you recall a time of change?" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=Expanded Grade III Process Checklist|journal=HCO Bulletin 14 Nov 1987|issue= V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!-- #1 --&gt;
:'''Grade IV:''' "What about a victim could you be responsible for?" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=Expanded Grade IV Process Checklist|journal=HCO Bulletin 14 Nov 1987|issue= VI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;!-- #5 --&gt;

Each Grade is targeted at a specific area of potential difficulty a person might have. The [[working hypothesis]] is that if the subject matter is not "charged"; in other words, if it is not causing any difficulty, then it will not read on the E-meter, and therefore will not be run.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The above processes demonstrate a key aspect of Scientology processes. The question or command can be quite general. It is absolutely forbidden (by the Auditor's Code) for the auditor to interpret the preclear's answer or discuss it in any way.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

A possible audit could be performed like this:

:'''Auditor:'''  "Recall a secret."
:'''Preclear:'''	"I deliberately broke the window in the hall with my ball."
:'''Auditor:''' "Thank you. .  Recall a secret."
:'''Preclear:'''	"I saw my sister kissing the postman."
:'''Auditor:''' "Ok. . Recall a secret."
:'''Preclear:'''	"I hate my mum's apple pie, but my dad told me not to tell her."
:'''Auditor:''' "Thank you. Recall a secret."

==Controversy==

===Preclear folders===

The Scientology and Dianetics auditing process has raised concerns from a number of quarters, as auditing sessions are permanently recorded in the form of handwritten notes in preclear folders, which are supposed to be kept private. Judge Paul Breckenridge, in Church of Scientology of California vs. Gerald Armstrong, noted that [[Mary Sue Hubbard]] (the plaintiff in that case) "authored the infamous order '[[Guardian's Office|GO]] 121669', which directed culling of supposedly confidential P.C. [Preclear] files/folders for the purposes of internal security". This directive was later canceled because it was not part of Scientology as written by L. Ron Hubbard. Bruce Hines has noted in an interview with [[Hoda Kotb]] that Scientology's collecting of personal and private information through auditing can possibly leave an adherent vulnerable to potential "blackmail" should they ever consider disaffecting from the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|

===Anderson Report===
{{main article|Anderson Report}}
In 1965 the [[Anderson Report]], an official inquiry conducted for the state of [[Victoria, Australia]], found that auditing involved a form of  "authoritative" or "command" [[hypnosis]], in which the hypnotist assumes "positive authoritative control" over the subject.  "It is the firm conclusion of this Board that most scientology and dianetic techniques are those of authoritative hypnosis and as such are dangerous. ... the scientific evidence which the Board heard from several expert witnesses of the highest repute ... which was virtually unchallenged - leads to the inescapable conclusion that it is only in name that there is any difference between authoritative hypnosis and most of the techniques of scientology. "&lt;ref&gt;'' Report of the Board of Enquiry into Scientology'') by Kevin Victor Anderson, Q.C. Published 1965 by the State of Victoria, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--p. 155--&gt;

As a result of the Anderson Report, a number of restrictive laws were passed in Australia against Scientology, but in the ensuing years, all were repealed.  As of 2011 auditing is considered a spiritual practice [[Scientology status by country|by the government of Australia]].

===Claims===
L. Ron Hubbard claimed benefits from auditing including improved [[IQ]], improved ability to communicate, enhanced memory and alleviation of issues such as [[psychosis]], [[dyslexia]] and [[attention deficit disorder]].&lt;ref name="IQ etc"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2011/02/08/archives/scientology-expose-new-yorker.html |title=The Original Scientology Exposé |publisher=''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' |date=February 8, 2011 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/have-you-ever-been-a-boo-hoo-by-hames-phelan-saturday-evening-post.pdf |title=Have You Ever Been a Boo-Hoo? |deadurl=no |accessdate=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people have alleged that auditing amounts to medical treatment without a license, and in the 1950s, some auditors were arrested on the charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8lgHtauc5R4C|title=The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion|last=Urban|first=Hugh B.|date=2011-08-22|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=069114608X|page=62|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church disputes that it is practicing medicine, and it has successfully established in United States courts of law that auditing addresses only spiritual relief.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Wright|first1 = Skelley|title = Opinion|url = https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18407779340802616532|publisher = United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia|accessdate = 10 April 2015|location = Washington, DC|date = February 5, 1969|page = 1154}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Church, the psychotherapist treats mental health and the Church treats the spiritual being. Hubbard clarified the difference between the two:
{{quotation|If we processed a specific type of aberration, we of course would be in the field of mental healing, and so forth. But long ago we actually discovered that we must not process specific aberrations, which takes us out of the field of mental healing.
It is quite fatal to do this because in the first place it's an evaluation for the case. In the second place, it's a negative type process; you're condemning the individual for hitting girls. Doesn't validate the individual at all. Do you follow? And if carried on very long, does not result in the betterment of an individual. All we're interested in is the spiritual betterment of the individual ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=L Ron|title=Scientology Definitions II|journal=Tape 6612C06|date=6 Dec 1966|series=SHSBC 83(446)}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In 1971, a ruling of the United States District Court, District of Columbia (333 F. Supp. 357), specifically stated that the [[E-meter]] "has no proven usefulness in the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of any disease, nor is it medically or scientifically capable of improving any bodily function."&lt;ref name="www-2.cs.cmu.edu"&gt;http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Secrets/E-Meter/Mark-VII/&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this ruling, Scientology now publishes disclaimers in its books and publications declaring that the E-meter "by itself does nothing" and that it is used specifically for spiritual purposes.&lt;ref name="www-2.cs.cmu.edu" /&gt;

===Child auditors===
Dutch investigative reporter Rinke Verkerk reported that she was given an auditing session by an 11-year-old in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Verkerk15"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verkerk|first1=Rinke|title=Vier maanden undercover bij de Scientologykerk - Media - Voor nieuws, achtergronden en columns|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/media/vier-maanden-undercover-bij-de-scientologykerk~a4034490/|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=De Volkskrant|date=20 May 2015|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been criticized by clinical psychologists and child psychologists, on the grounds that [[Psychological stress|secondary stress]] can affect children more strongly than adults.&lt;ref name="Kuiper15"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuiper|first1=Rik|title=Scientologykerk laat kinderen therapieën volwassenen leiden - Binnenland - Voor nieuws, achtergronden en columns|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/scientologykerk-laat-kinderen-therapieen-volwassenen-leiden~a4034261/|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=De Volkskrant|date=19 May 2015|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the child was working full days for a whole weekend was also considered to be problematic.&lt;ref name=Kuiper15 /&gt;

The Sangha has responded to natural calamities in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] states, the [[Bengal famine of 1943]], the [[Bhopal disaster]], the [[2001 Gujarat earthquake]], and the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]].&lt;ref name="speakerloksabha"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.speakerloksabha.nic.in/Speech/SpeechDetails.asp?SpeechId=283 | title = Address on, Secularism and National Integration, at the Annual Celebration Day of the Bharat Sevashram Sangha, New Delhi, 24 October 2008 | date=24 October 2008 | accessdate = 25 November 2008 | publisher = The Office of Speaker Lok Sabha | quote = Bharat Sevashram Sangha, with the goal of universal emancipation, has been tirelessly working for the uplift of the downtrodden and the neglected sections of our society, ever since its foundation in 1917.

Following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], the Sangha's monks proposed to set up a school for [[orphan]]s at a cost of [[Indian rupee|Rs.]] 4250,000s, an orphanage at Rs.6020,000, and 200 houses at Rs.30&amp;nbsp;millions on the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and [[Nicobar Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hindu.com/2005/02/15/stories/2005021507910500.htm | title = Monks to take up rehabilitation in Andaman and Nicobar | publisher = [[The Hindu]] | date = 19 February 2005 | accessdate = 15 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tamil Nadu]] state, where the tsunami killed more than 7,000 in the districts of [[Cuddalore]], [[Nagapattinam]] and [[Chennai]], the Sangha was one of the first to begin massive relief operations by building nearly 200 new houses at Sonankuppam village in Cuddaloer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10897">[[Buddhologist]] [[Edward Conze]] (1966) has proposed that similarities existed between '''Buddhism and Gnosticism''', a term deriving from the name "[[Gnostics]]" given to a number of [[Christian sect]]s. To the extent that the Buddha taught the existence of evil inclinations that remain unconquered, or that require special spiritual knowledge to conquer, Buddhism has also qualified as Gnostic.

==Conze==
{{main|Buddhism and Christianity}}

[[Edward Conze]] claimed to have noted phenomenological commonalities between [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and Gnosticism,{{sfn|Verardi|1997|p=323}} in his paper ''Buddhism and Gnosis'', following an early suggestion by [[Isaac Jacob Schmidt]].{{sfn|Conze|1967}}{{refn|group=note|The paper was presented at the conference ''Origins of gnosticism: colloquium of Messina'', held 13–18 April 1966. Conze: "The topic of my paper has a fairly long ancestry. Already in 1828 Isaac Jacob Schmidt, a German living in Russia, published a pamphlet entitled ''Über die Verwandtschaft der gnostisch-theosophischen Lehren mit den Religionssystemen des Orients, vorzüglich dem Buddhaismus''."{{sfn|Conze|1967|p=651}} ("About the relationship of Gnostic theosophical teachings with religious systems of the East, especially Buddhism").}} Conze explicitly compared Mahayana Buddhism with "gnosis," that is, knowledge or insight, and not with "the Gnostics," because too little was known about the Gnostics as a social group.{{sfn|Conze|1967}} Based on Conze's eight similarities, Hoeller gives the following list of similarities:{{sfn|Hoeller|2012|p=180}}
* Liberation or salvation can be achieved by a liberating insight, namely ''gnosis'' or ''[[jnana]]''
* Ignorance, or a lack of insight, called ''agnosis'' or ''[[avidhya]]'', is the root cause of entrapment in this world
* Liberating insight can be achieved by interior revelation, not by external knowledge
* Both systems give a hierarchical ordering of spiritual attainment, from blind materialism to complete spiritual attainment
* Wisdom, as the feminine principle personified in ''[[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]]'' and ''prajna'', plays an important role in both religions
* Myth is preferred over historical fact; the Christ and the Buddha are not mere historical figures, but archetypal [[Primordial Buddha|primordial]] beings
* Both systems have [[antinomianism|antinomianistic]] tendencies, that is, a disregard for rules and social conventions in higher spiritual attainments
* Both systems are intended for spiritual elites, not for the masses, and have hidden meanings and teachings
* Both systems are monistic, aiming at a metaphyscial oneness beyond the multiplicity of the phenomenal world.

According to Conze, these commonalities were not by chance, but inherent to the essence of both religions.{{sfn|Verardi|1997|p=323}} How these similarities came into existence was unclear for Conze,{{sfn|Verardi|1997|p=323}} but according to Verardi they may be related to the sea trade between the Roman Empire and India, which was intense at the time.{{sfn|Verardi|1997|p=334-336}} Verardi further notes the similarities between the social-economic base of both Gnosticism and Buddhism, namely merchants, which both had to compete with the "great organised powers," of Rome and the Christian Church, and of the Brahmans.{{sfn|Verardi|1997|p=337-338}} Both communities represented "an open economy and society lacking the defenses (and the vexations) of ''[[Nomos (mythology)|nomos]]''," the law and institutions of the establishment.{{sfn|Verardi|1997|p=339-340}}

Conze's suggestions were noted by Elaine Pagels as a "possibility," in the introduction to ''The Gnostic Gospels'',{{sfn|Pagels|1979}}{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=68}}{{refn|group=note|Bennett: "Pagels does not rule out Buddhist and Hindu influence on the Gnostic corpus. She cites the eminent Buddhologist Edward Conze (1904-79): 'Buddhists were in contact with Thomas Christians (that is, Christians who knew and used such.'"{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=68}}}} but Pagels' and Conze's suggestion has not gained academic acceptance or generated significant further study.

==Manicheism==
{{Main|Manicheism}}

According to Giuseppe Tucci, Manicheism may have influenced Tantric Buddhism,{{sfn|Verardi|1997|p=323}} while Mircea Eliade noted similarities in the symbolism of light and mystic knowledge, predating Manicheism, and possibly going back to an early common Indo-Iranian source.{{sfn|Verardi|1997|323-324}} Verardi notes that Manicheism is the prime source for comparisons between Buddhism and Gnosticism, Manicheism representing "the same urban and mercantile ambience of which Buddhism was an expression in India."{{sfn|Verardi|1997|332}} When the mercantile economy declined, with the decline of the Roman empire, Manicheism lost its support.{{sfn|Verardi|1997|332-333}} The Manicheists were hostile to the closed society of farming and landownership, just like the Buddhism conflicted with the "non-urban world controlled by Brahman laymen."{{sfn|Verardi|1997|333}}{{refn|group=note|Note that [[Decline of Buddhism in India|Buddhism declined in India]] after the end of the Gupta empire (c. 320–650 CE), which was related to the decline of the Roman Empire and the decline of sea trade. Power was decentralised in India, and Buddhism lost its support from royal courts, being replaced by Brahmanical Hinduism.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}}}}

Mani, an [[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia|Arsacid]] Persian by birth,{{refn|group=note|*  Mary Boyce, ''Zoroastrians: their religious beliefs and practices'', Routledge, 2001.  pg 111: "He was Iranian, of noble Parthian blood..."&lt;br&gt;* Warwick Ball, ''Rome in the East: the transformation of an empire'', Routledge, 2001.  pg 437: "Manichaeism was a syncretic religion, proclaimed by the Iranian Prophet Mani.&lt;br&gt;* Sundermann, Werner, ''Mani, the founder of the religion of Manicheism in the 3rd century AD'', Encyclopaeia Iranica, 2009.}} was born 216 AD in [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]), then within the Persian [[Sassanid Empire]].{{sfn|Coyle|2009}} According to the [[Cologne Mani-Codex]], Mani's parents were members of the [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish Christian]] [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] sect known as the [[Elcesaites]].{{sfn|Koenen|Römer|1988}}

Mani believed that the teachings of [[Buddha]], [[Zoroaster]], and [[Jesus]] were incomplete, and that his revelations were for the entire world, calling his teachings the "Religion of Light."{{sfn|Coyle|2009|p=13}} Following Mani's travels to the [[Kushan Empire]]{{refn|group=note|Several religious paintings in [[Bamiyan]] are attributed to him.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}}} at the beginning of his proselytizing career, various [[Buddhist]] influences seem to have permeated Manichaeism:
{{quote|Buddhist influences were significant in the formation of Mani's religious thought. The transmigration of souls became a Manichaean belief, and the quadripartite structure of the Manichaean community, divided between male and female monks (the "elect") and lay followers (the "hearers") who supported them, appears to be based on that of the Buddhist [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]].{{sfn|Foltz|2010}}}}

Early 3rd century–4th century [[Christian]] writers such as [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] and [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] write about a [[Scythianus]], who visited India around 50 CE from where he brought four books and "the doctrine of the Two Principles", in which the early church fathers describe as assigning both "good" and "evil" to God. According to [[Cyril of Jerusalem]], Scythianus' pupil [[Terebinthus]] presented himself as a "Buddha" ("He called himself Buddas").&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310106.htm Cyril of Jerusalem Catechetical Lecture 6, paragraph 23]&lt;/ref&gt; Terebinthus went to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Judea|Judaea]] ("becoming known and condemned"), and ultimately settled in [[Babylon]], where he transmitted his teachings to a woman who left his books to a young [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], thereby creating the foundation of [[Manichaeism]]:
{{quote|"But Terebinthus, his disciple in this wicked error, inherited his money and books and heresy, and came to Palestine, and becoming known and condemned in Judæa he resolved to pass into Persia: but lest he should be recognised there also by his name he changed it and called himself Buddas."|[[Cyril of Jerusalem]], [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310106.htm "Catechetical lecture 6"]}}

According to [[Willis Barnstone]] and Marvin Meyer, evidence of the influence of Buddhist thought on the teachings of Mani can be found throughout texts related to Mani.&lt;ref&gt;Willis Barnstone, ''The Gnostic Bible''&lt;/ref&gt; In the story of the Death of Mani, the Buddhist term [[Nirvana]] is being used:
{{quote|It was a day of pain&lt;br&gt;and a time of sorrow&lt;br&gt;when the messenger of light&lt;br&gt;entered death&lt;br&gt;when he entered complete ''[[Nirvana]]''}}

'''Buddhism in Pakistan''' took root some 2,300 years ago under the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] king [[Ashoka]], whom Nehru once called “greater than any king or emperor.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buddhism In Pakistan|url=http://pakteahouse.net/2008/07/18/800-years-of-buddhism-in-pakistan/|website=pakteahouse.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120153001/http://pakteahouse.net/2008/07/18/800-years-of-buddhism-in-pakistan/|archivedate=20 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]] has a long history in present-day  [[history of Pakistan]] — over time being part of areas within [[Bactria]], the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]], the [[Kushan Empire]]; [[Ancient India]] with the [[Maurya Empire]] of [[Ashoka]], the [[Pala Empire]]; the [[Punjab region]], and [[Indus River|Indus River Valley]] cultures — areas now within the present day nation of Pakistan. Buddhist scholar Kumāralabdha ([[:zh:童受|童受]]) of the [[Ruins at Taxila|Taxila]] was comparable to [[Aryadeva]], [[Aśvaghoṣa]] and [[Nagarjuna]].

In 2012, the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) indicated that the contemporary Buddhist population of Pakistan was minuscule with 1,492 adult holders of national identity cards (CNICs). The total population of Buddhists is therefore unlikely to be more than a few thousand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Over 35,000 Buddhists, Baha’is call Pakistan home|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/430059/over-35000-buddhists-bahais-call-pakistan-home/|agency=Tribune|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102005352/http://tribune.com.pk/story/430059/over-35000-buddhists-bahais-call-pakistan-home/|archivedate=2 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, number of Buddhist voters was stated to be 1,884 and they are mostly concentrated in Sindh and Punjab.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-elections-non-muslim-voters-up-by-30-hindus-biggest-minority/story-gRmBeL4TaBBgY6ZTURRA7M.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gautama Buddha statue (5th century CE).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Buddha]] from the Kahu-jo-daro [[stupa]] displayed in [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya]].]]
[[File:Cave city Gondhrani.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Buddhist Cave city Gondhrani, Balochistan.]]
Buddhism came to this part of the country in the late 7th century when most of the masses were practicing [[bon]] religion. 
Before the arrival of Islam, Tibetan Buddhism and Bön (to a lesser extent) were the main religions in Baltistan. Buddhism can be traced back to before the formation of the Tibetan Empire. The region has a number of surviving Buddhist archaeological sites. These include the [[Manthal Buddha Rock]], a rock relief of the [[Buddha]] at the edge of the village (near Skardu) and the [[Sacred Rock of Hunza]]. Nearby are former sites of Buddhist shelters.

Baltistan had Buddhist majority till the 15th century, before the arrival of Islam in this region. Since then most of the people converted to Islam, the presence of Buddhism in this region has now been limited to archeological sites, as the remaining  Buddhists of this region moved east to [[ladakh]] where Buddhism is the majority religion.

==== Gandhara ====
The majority of people in [[Gandhara]], present-day Southern [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province, were Buddhist. Gandhara was largely [[Mahayana]] Buddhist, but also a stronghold of [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism. The [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]] Valley, known in antiquity as Uddiyana, was a kingdom tributary to Gandhara. There are many archaeological sites from the Buddhist era in Swat.

==== Uddiyana ====
The Buddhist sage [[Padmasambhava]] is said to have been born in a village near the present day town of Chakdara in [[Lower Dir District]], which was then a part of [[Oddiyana]]. Padmasambhava is known as Guru Rinpoche in Tibetan and it is he who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet.

==== Punjab region ====
Buddhism was practiced in the [[Punjab region]], with many [[Buddhist monastery]] and [[stupa]] sites in the [[Taxila]] [[World Heritage Site]] locale. It was also practiced in the [[Sindh]] regions.

==== Sindh ====
Buddhist sites in Sindh are numerous but ill preserved and various stages of deterioration. Sites at [[Mansura (Brahmanabad)|Brahmanabad]] (Mansura Sanghar district, Buddhist stupa at [[Mohenjo-daro|mohen jo daro]], [[Siraj-ji-Takri|Sirah-ji-takri]] near Rohri, Sukkur, [[Kahu-Jo-Darro|Kahu Jo Daro]] at Mirpur Khas, Nawabshah, Sudheran jo Thul near Hyderabad, [[Thul Mir Rukan]] stupa near Moro Many terracota tiles from Kaho jo Daro and Buddha statues are exhibited in [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya|Chatrapati Shivaji museum]], Mumbai&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://coromandelart.wordpress.com/2016/10/18/fifth-century-stupa-ruins-from-mirpurkhas-in-pakistan/|title=Ancient Buddhist terracottas from Mirpurkhas in Pakistan|date=2016-10-18|work=Art of South Asia, the Silk Road and Beyond|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Balochistan ====
Chinese Buddhist traveller [[Xuanzang|Hiuen Tsang]] reported many Buddhist temples in coastal regions of [[Makran]], Balochistan. The remains of Buddhist cave city called [[Gondrani|Godrani Caves]] can still be seen today.

==Buddhism in modern Pakistan==
The presence of Pakistani Buddhists in modern pakistan is unclear,&lt;ref&gt;[https://pk.boell.org/sites/default/files/thread_not_scissor.pdf  Thread, Not Scissor Common Spiritual Heritage For Peace And Harmony,  Ahmad Salim, SARRC – December 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; although a few Pakistanis have reported themselves as Buddhist. A report mentions that they are only found in the so called Azad Kashmir region.&lt;ref&gt;800 years of Buddhism in Pakistan,  Emi Foulk, The Friday Times, July 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Nurbakhshi sect is said to retain some elements of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baltistan.eus/news/articles/the-nurbakhshi-religion-in-baltistan  THE NURBAKHSHI RELIGION IN BALTISTAN, Xabier Rentería, 26-11/2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Another report mentions a nomadic Baori ([[Bawariya]]) tribe on the outskirts of Mandi Yazman and Rahimyar Khan as being Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thefridaytimes.com/tft/meeting-pakistans-buddhists/  Meeting Pakistan’s Buddhists  Ammad Ali, Daily Times, Sep 8, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raja Tridiv Roy|Tridev Roy]], the Chakma chief, supported Pakistan during the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] left the Chittagong region and settled in Pakistan. He claimed to represent the Buddhists of Pakistan by founding and chairing the "Pakistan Buddhist Society" from 1996 until his death in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/51199  Monks to start peace march tomorrow,August 05, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; His family stayed behind in Bangladesh.

==Islam and Hinduism==
Gandhara remained a largely Hindu-Buddhist land until around 10th century CE, when [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud]] conquered the region and introduced [[Islam]]. There was settlement of Muslims and the emigration of Hindu-Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;Ousel, M. (1997). Ancient india and indian civilization. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thul Mir Rukan.jpg|thumb|Buddhist stupa near Dadu, Sindh]]
Most Buddhists in [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Sindh]] were in process of converting to [[Hinduism]] from 600 CE onwards. Many Buddhists converted to [[Islam]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. Buddhism was practiced by the majority of the population of Sindh up to the [[Arab people|Arab]] conquest by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in 710 CE. These regions became predominantly [[Muslim]] during the rule of [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later the [[Mughal Empire]] due to the [[Dua|missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints whose [[dargah]]s (shrines) dot the landscape of [[Pakistan]] and the rest of [[South Asia]].

== Pakistan Buddhist tourism ==
In March 2013, a group of around 20 Buddhist monks from South Korea made the journey to the monastery of Takht-e-Bahi, 170 kilometres (106 miles) from [[Islamabad]]. The monks defied appeals from Seoul to abandon their trip for safety reasons and were guarded by Pakistani security forces on their visit to the monastery, built of ochre-coloured stone and nestled on a mountainside. From around 1,000 years BC until the seventh century AD, northern Pakistan and parts of modern Afghanistan formed the Gandhara kingdom, where Greek and Buddhist customs mixed to create what became the Mahayana strand of the religion. The monk Marananta set out from what is now northwest Pakistan to cross China and spread Buddhism on the Korean peninsula during the fourth century. The authorities are even planning package tours for visitors from China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, including trips to the Buddhist sites at Takht-e-Bahi, Swat, Peshawar and Taxila, near Islamabad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan hopes for Buddhist tourism boost|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/796713/pakistan-hopes-for-buddhist-tourism-boost|agency=Dawn News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120133732/http://www.dawn.com/news/796713/pakistan-hopes-for-buddhist-tourism-boost|archivedate=20 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Takht-i-Bahi ===
[[File:Takht-bhai-3.jpg|thumbnail|[[Takht-i-Bahi]]]]
Takht means “throne” and bahi, “water” or “spring” in Persian/Urdu. The monastic complex was called [[Takht-i-Bahi]] because it was built atop a hill and also adjacent to a stream. Located 80 kilometers from Peshawar and 16 kilometers Northwest of the city of Mardan, Takht-I-Bahi was unearthed in early 20th century and in 1980 it was included in the UNESCO World Heritage list as the largest Buddhist remains in Gandhara, along with the Sahr-i-Bahlol urban remains that date back to the same period, located about a kilometer south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Takht Bhai|url=http://www.findpk.com/Pakistan/html/buddhist_sites.html|website=www.findpk.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810102443/http://www.findpk.com/Pakistan/html/buddhist_sites.html|archivedate=10 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxila ===
[[File:((By @ibnAzhar))0DharmaRajika Stupa-Taxila-Pakistan (63).JPG|thumbnail|DharmaRajika Stupa-Taxila]]
The modern town of Taxila is 35&amp;nbsp;km from Islamabad. Most of the archaeological sites of [[Taxila]] (600 BC to 500 AD) are located around [[Taxila Museum]]. For over one thousand years, Taxila remained famous as a centre of learning Gandhara art of sculpture, architecture, education and Buddhism in the days of Buddhist glory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taxila|url=http://www.pakistantoursguide.com/taxila-museum.html|website=www.pakistantoursguide.com/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121120435/http://www.pakistantoursguide.com/taxila-museum.html|archivedate=21 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are over 50 archaeological sites scattered in a radius of 30&amp;nbsp;km around Taxila. Some of the most important sites are: Dhamarajika Stupa and Monastery (300 BC - 200 AD), Bhir Mound (600-200 BC), Sirkap (200 BC - 600 AD), Jandial Temple (c.250 BC) and Jaulian Monastery (200 - 600 AD).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Buddhism in Taxila|url=http://www.findpk.com/Pakistan/html/buddhist_sites.html|website=www.findpk.com/Pakistan/html/buddhist_sites.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810102443/http://www.findpk.com/Pakistan/html/buddhist_sites.html|archivedate=10 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[museum]] comprising various sections with rich archaeological finds of [[Taxila]], arranged in chronological order and properly labeled, has been established close to the site.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Mingora ===
[[File:Votive Stupas - Butkara-III.JPG|thumbnail|Votive Stupas - Butkara-III Mingora]]
[[Mingora]], 3&amp;nbsp;km away from [[Saidu Sharif]], has yielded magnificent pieces of Buddhist sculpture and the ruins of a great [[stupa]]. Shingardar Stupa is one of the famous located near Bariko Other stupas like Amaan Kot and Jehan-a-Abad are too a great asset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buddhism in Mingora|url=http://www.cybercity-online.net/Pakistan/html/buddhist_sites.html|website=www.cybercity-online.net/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126140625/http://www.cybercity-online.net/Pakistan/html/buddhist_sites.html|archivedate=26 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Swat ===
[[File:General View of Shingardar Stupa - From Eastern Side.JPG|thumbnail|Shingardar Stupa]]
The Lush-green valley of [[Swat District]]&amp;mdash;with its rushing torrents, icy-cold lakes, fruit-laden orchards and flower-decked slopes&amp;mdash;is ideal for holiday-makers intent on relaxation. It also has a rich historical past: "Udayana" (the "Garden") of the ancient Hindu epics; "the land of enthralling beauty", where Alexander of Macedonia fought and won some of his major battles before crossing over to the plains of Pakistan, and "the valley of the hanging chains" described by the famous Chinese pilgrim-chroniclers, [[Faxian]] and [[Xuanzang]] in the fifth and seventh centuries. Swat was once a cradle for major strands of Buddhism, where 1,400 monasteries flourished: [[Little Vehicle]], [[Mahayana|Great Vehicle]] and the [[Vajrayana|Esoteric sects]]. It was the home of the famous Gandhara School of Sculpture which was an expression of Graeco-Roman form in the local Buddhist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buddhism in SWAT|url=http://www.cybercity-online.net/Pakistan/html/buddhist_sites.html|website=www.cybercity-online.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126140625/http://www.cybercity-online.net/Pakistan/html/buddhist_sites.html|archivedate=26 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Datsan Gunzechoinei]] in Saint Petersburg, the northernmost Buddhist temple in Russia

==History==
The first evidence of the existence of Buddhism in the territory of modern Russia belong to the 8th century AD. E. And are associated with the state of [[Balhae]], which in 698-926 occupied part of today's Primorye and Amur. The [[Mohe people|Mohe]], whose culture was greatly influenced by neighboring China, Korea and Manchuria, professed the Buddhism of one of the Mahayana directions.
It primarily spread into the Russian constituent regions geographically or culturally adjacent to Mongolia, or inhabited by [[Mongols|Mongolian ethnic groups]]: [[Buryatia]], [[Zabaykalsky Krai]], [[Tuva]], and  [[Kalmykia]], the latter being the only Buddhist region in Europe, located to the north of the Caucasus. By 1887, there were already 29 publishing houses&lt;ref name="buddharu"/&gt; and numerous [[datsan]]s.&lt;ref name="buddharu"/&gt; After the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], the datsans were closed down.&lt;ref name="advantour"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advantour.com/russia/religion/buddhism.htm|title=Buddhism in Russia|website=www.advantour.com|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, Buddhists were suffering more than any other religious community in the Soviet Union&lt;ref name="today"/&gt; with lamas being expelled and accused of being "Japanese spies" and "the people's enemies".&lt;ref name="buddharu"/&gt;

==Revival==
[[File:Золотые ворота2.jpg|300px|thumb|Golden Gate in [[Elista]], [[Republic of Kalmykia]]]]
After [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|the fall of the Soviet Union]], a Buddhist revival began in Kalmykia with the election of President [[Kirsan Ilyumzhinov]].&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; It was also revived in Buryatia and Tuva and began to spread to Russians in other regions.

In 1992, the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] made his first visit to [[Tuva]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwrn.org/articles/18111/?&amp;place=russia&amp;section=buddhism|title=RUSSIA: When will Dalai Lama next visit Tuva? - WWRN - World-wide Religious News|website=wwrn.org|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several Tibetan Buddhist university-monasteries throughout Russia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tricycle.com/blog/?p=1425|title=lettucecomic|first=|last=Tricycle|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; concentrated in [[Siberia]], known as [[Datsan]]s.&lt;ref name="advantour"/&gt;

[[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy]], a renowned Russian [[Indologist]] who traveled to [[India]] and [[Mongolia]] during the time of the [[Russian Empire]], is widely considered by many to be responsible for laying the foundations for the study of Buddhism in the Western world.

There are now between 700,000 and 1.5 million Buddhists in Russia, mainly in the republics of [[Buryatia]], [[Kalmykia]] and [[Tuva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Putin Promises 100% Support for Buddhists|url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20130411/180578136/Putin-Promises-100-Support-for-Buddhists.html|publisher=Ria Novosti|accessdate=15 April 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414044144/http://en.ria.ru/russia/20130411/180578136/Putin-Promises-100-Support-for-Buddhists.html|archivedate=14 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Church of Scientology Moscow v Russia''''' [2007] [http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2007/258.html ECHR 258] is a [[European Court of Human Rights]] case, concerning Article 11 of the Convention. In the case the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]] condemned [[Moscow]] City Government's refusal to consider the Church of Scientology of Moscow for registration as a religious organisation,&lt;ref name="ECHR-Russia"&gt;[[European Court of Human Rights]] first section [http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=815108&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Judgment on Application no. 18147/02 by CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY OF MOSCOW against Russia] (2007-04-18). [http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=815107&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Court press release here]. Retrieved on 2007-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result found that Russia had violated the rights of the Church of Scientology under Articles 11 (the right to freedom of association) when "read in the light of Article 9" (the right to freedom of religion). Specifically, the Court determined that, in denying consideration of registration to the Church of Scientology of Moscow, the Moscow authorities "did not act in good faith and neglected their duty of neutrality and impartiality vis-à-vis the applicant's religious community". The Court also awarded the Church €10,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and €15,000 for costs and expenses.&lt;ref name="ECHR-Russia" /&gt;

==Facts==
The Church of Scientology of Moscow describes itself as a religious association and was officially registered as such in January 1994.  On 1 October 1997, a new ''Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations (Religion Law)'' entered into force, requiring all religious associations previously granted the status of a legal entity to bring their articles of association into conformity with the Religion Law and to re-apply for registration with the competent Justice Department before 31 December 2000. Failure to obtain "re-registration" before the expiration of that time limit exposed the Church to the threat of dissolution by judicial decision.&lt;ref name="ECHR-Russia" /&gt;

The Church of Scientology of Moscow subsequently applied eleven times for re-registration to the Moscow Justice Department between August 1998 and May 2005. Each application was rejected.  The first two applications were refused on the grounds that the Church had violated unspecified laws.  The third to fifth applications were refused on the grounds that the Church had failed to submit unspecified documents.  The sixth to tenth applications were refused on the grounds that the Church had failed to comply with the time limit for re-registration, although the Constitutional Court had already held that this reason was not valid.  Finally, the eleventh application was refused on the ground that the Church had failed to prove its existence in Moscow for at least 15 years, although the Constitutional Court had already held that this reason was not valid.&lt;ref name="ECHR-Russia" /&gt;

The refusal to re-register the Moscow Church under the Religion Law placed its status as a legal entity in jeopardy. The consequences of non-registration as a religious organization within the meaning of the Law were extreme for the Church and its members. As a result of the arbitrary refusal to re-register, the rights of the Church and its parishioners essential to the conduct of their religious activities on anything but the most primitive level were seriously jeopardized, including the ability to own and operate educational institutions including theological schools, to own and maintain religious buildings, to conduct charitable activities, the right to acquire, import and distribute religious literature and the right to invite foreign citizens to preach and conduct religious services.&lt;ref name="ECHR-Russia" /&gt;

As a result of a complaint filed by the Church, the Nikulinskiy District Court of Moscow found, on 8 December 2000, that the Justice’s Department refusal to re-register the Church was unlawful. It concluded that the Justice Department had, in essence, used subterfuge to avoid re-registration of the Church and pointed out that an association with no status as a legal entity was, in particular, prevented from renting premises for religious ceremonies and worship, receiving and disseminating religious literature or holding a bank account. It also held that that refusal had been inconsistent with international standards of law. That decision became binding and enforceable on 19 December 2000. However, the Justice Department refused to comply with it and, in March 2001, it was quashed by way of supervisory review by the government. Subsequently, the [[Russian courts]] upheld the systematic refusal to register the Moscow Church. The Church then filed an application with the European Court in 2002.&lt;ref name="ECHR-Russia" /&gt;

==Judgment==
In its decision overturning the refusal by Russian authorities to re-register the Church, the Human Rights Court determined that the Church of Scientology of Moscow was a "religious community" entitled to the rights afforded such communities by ECHR Article 9, which protects the right to freedom of religion or belief. The Court held that where the organization of a religious community is at issue, "a refusal to recognize it" not only constitutes interference with its right to freedom of association protected by ECHR Article 11. It also constitutes interference with the applicants' right to freedom of religion under Article 9 of the Convention. The Court noted that "the believers' right to freedom of religion encompasses the expectation that the community will be allowed to function peacefully, free from arbitrary State intervention". Therefore, the Court determined that the failure to recognize the Church of Scientology through rejection of registration offended these fundamental religious freedom and association rights.&lt;ref name="ECHR-Russia" /&gt;

==Significance==

{{quote|The Court refers to its settled case-law to the effect that, as enshrined in Article 9, freedom of thought, conscience and religion is one of the foundations of a "democratic society" within the meaning of the Convention. It is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it.&lt;ref name="ECHR-Russia" /&gt;}}

This expansive approach is consistent with the Court’s application of a fundamental human rights policy of the [[Council of Europe]] to religious freedom issues – "the need to secure true religious pluralism, an inherent feature of the notion of a democratic society".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religlaw.org/template.php?id=322 Manoussakis. Others v. Greece], (59/1995/565/651) (26 September 1996), paragraph 44&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Court has emphasized the importance of "pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no democratic society".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religlaw.org/template.php?id=322 Manoussakis, Others v. Greece], (59/1995/565/651) (26 September 1996), paragraph 41&lt;/ref&gt; As the Court has stressed,

{{quote|While religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual conscience, it also implies, inter alia, freedom to "manifest [one's] religion" alone and in private or in community with others, in public and within the circle of those whose faith one shares. Since religious communities traditionally exist in the form of organized structures, Article 9 must be interpreted in the light of Article 11 of the Convention, which safeguards associative life against unjustified State interference. Seen in that perspective, the right of believers to freedom of religion, which includes the right to manifest one's religion in community with others, encompasses the expectation that believers will be allowed to associate freely, without arbitrary State intervention. Indeed, the autonomous existence of religious communities is indispensable for pluralism in a democratic society and is thus an issue at the very heart of the protection which Article 9 affords. The State's duty of neutrality and impartiality, as defined in the Court's case-law, is incompatible with any power on the State's part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="ECHR-Russia" /&gt;}}

The Court then dismissed the government's claims that the refusal to register the Moscow Church of Scientology did not constitute a violation of the Church's fundamental human rights as it was not dissolved and could continue to operate. Instead, the Court applied its findings in ''Moscow Branch of The Salvation Army v. Russia'' case&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nomokanon.de/urteile/eughmr061005.htm CASE OF THE MOSCOW BRANCH OF THE SALVATION ARMY v. RUSSIA] (Application no. 72881/01), JUDGMENT, 5 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to find that the Moscow Church of Scientology was being prevented from exercising its full range of religious activities.

{{quote|The Court has already found in a similar case that this situation disclosed an interference with the religious organization's right to freedom of association and also with its right to freedom of religion insofar as the Religions Act restricted the ability of a religious association without legal-entity status to exercise the full range of religious activities (see ''The Moscow Branch of The Salvation Army v. Russia''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclj.org/PDF/06100506_THE_SALVATION_ARMY_v_RUSSIA_JUDGMENT.pdf Salvation Army vs. Russia, Judgement at European Center for Law and Justice]&lt;/ref&gt;). These findings are applicable in the present case as well.&lt;ref name="ECHR-Russia" /&gt;}}

Likewise, the Court found that the government's actions constituted an interference with the Church of Scientology's rights to freedom of association and religion.

{{quote|The Court has expressed the view that a refusal by the domestic authorities to grant legal-entity status to an association of individuals may amount to an interference with the applicants' exercise of their right to freedom of association. Where the organization of the religious community is at issue, a refusal to recognize it also constitutes interference with the applicants' right to freedom of religion under Article 9 of the Convention. The believers' right to freedom of religion encompasses the expectation that the community will be allowed to function peacefully, free from arbitrary State intervention.&lt;ref name="ECHR-Russia" /&gt;}}

The Court then concluded by stating that

{{quote|[I]n view of the Court's finding above that the reasons invoked by the Moscow Justice Department and endorsed by the Moscow courts to deny re-registration of the applicant branch had no legal basis, it can be inferred that, in denying registration to the Church of Scientology of Moscow, the Moscow authorities did not act in good faith and neglected their duty of neutrality and impartiality vis-à-vis the applicant's religious community. In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that the interference with the applicant's right to freedom of religion and association was not justified. There has therefore been a violation of Article 11 of the Convention read in the light of Article 9.&lt;ref name="ECHR-Russia" /&gt;}}

This is not the first time that the Strasbourg organs have ruled in favor of Scientology. The Church of Scientology has previously been before the European Commission on Human Rights in a case that decided that a Church could represent its members to assert their religious rights under Article 9 (see ''X and Church of Scientology v. Sweden'' 16 DR 109 [Ecom HR 1979]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minorityrights.org/Legal/religion/caselaw/legal_rel_case_XandChurch.htm Case Summary at Minority Rights Group Int].&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission concluded that the Church of Scientology, as "a Church body is capable of possessing and exercising the rights contained in Article 9(1) in its own capacity as a representative of its members."

Moreover, on 9 June 2005, the European Court of Human Rights (First Section) issued an important admissibility decision concerning issues relating to the registration of two Scientology Churches as a religious organization under Russian national law. In that case, ''Kimlya, Aidar Sultanov and Church of Scientology of Nizhnekamsk vs Russia'' (Application nos. 76836/01 and 32782/03),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclj.org/PDF/06100506_THE_SALVATION_ARMY_v_RUSSIA_JUDGMENT.pdf Judgement at European Center for Law and Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; the Court considered separate applications regarding the refusal of Russian authorities to register Scientology Churches as religious organizations filed by founding members of two Churches of Scientology, the Church of Scientology of [[Surgut]] City in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Region of the Russian Federation, and the Church of Scientology of [[Nizhnekamsk]] in the Tatarstan Republic of the Russian Federation.

In its admissibility decision, the European Court of Human Rights determined, after examining extensive submissions and arguments by the parties, that the founding members' and the Church's complaint regarding the refusal of Russian authorities to re-register it was admissible.

{{quote|The Court considers, in the light of the parties' submissions, that this part of the applications raises serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which requires an examination of the merits.}}

In September 2009, the European Court of Human Rights issued a binding ruling in favor of the Scientology branches in Surgut and Nizhnekamsk.&lt;ref name="AP20091002"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iJ_Lp6ZG3jVlOzswrzbOGf08SdkgD9B2BUGG0|title=Scientologists win rights case against Russia|date=2009-10-02|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two organizations were awarded €20,000 in costs and damages.&lt;ref name="AP20091002" /&gt; The ruling, which cannot be appealed, said that Russia could not ban the Church of Scientology simply because it did not have a long history in the country.&lt;ref name="AP20091002" /&gt;

The [[Scientology Task Force of the Hamburg Interior Authority|Scientology Working Group of the City of Hamburg]] posted comments on the city's website, in English, containing its assessment of the judgment and its implications.&lt;ref name="taskforce"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fhh.hamburg.de/stadt/Aktuell/behoerden/inneres/arbeitsgruppe-scientology/2007-04-12-anmerkungen-engl-pdf,property=source.pdf |format=PDF| title = Comments on the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights of 5th April 2007 – Case of Church of Scientology Moscow v. Russia | accessdate = 2007-05-16 | date = 2007-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Working group commented, "The ECHR itself did not consider whether the Scientology organisation as such meets the characteristics of a religion (or religious community) within the meaning of article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights in terms of its structure and beliefs. The Court based its ruling merely on the specifically Russian and consequently national assessment of the 'Church of Scientology Moscow' being an association of a religious nature, without positively according the Scientology organisation as a whole the status of a religious community."   The task force concluded that the ECHR did not grant the Church a "positive entitlement" to registration as a religious entity in Russia nor did it make a ruling on the religious nature of Scientology that would be binding on ECHR signatories other than Russia.&lt;ref name="taskforce" /&gt;

In view of the judgment the European Human Rights Office of the Church of Scientology International emphasized a "need for dialogue" with governments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2007/09/26579_en.pdf "Submission to OSCE Human Dimension Implementation Meeting", Sept 26, 2007, page 2, by Fabio Amicarelli, OSCE homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Covenant of the Goddess''' ('''CoG''') is a cross-traditional [[Wicca]]n group of solitary Wiccan practitioners and over one hundred affiliated [[coven]]s (or congregations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Adler | first = Margot | title = Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today | publisher = [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] | year = 2006 |isbn = 0-14-019536-X| page = 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1975 in order to increase co-operation among [[witches]] and to secure for witches and [[covens]] the legal protection enjoyed by members of other religions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cog.org/about-cog/additional-information]&lt;/ref&gt; Member covens generally focus [[theology]] and [[ritual]] around the worship of the Goddess and the Old Gods (or the Goddess alone), which is general practice within Wicca.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cog.org/how-to-join]&lt;/ref&gt; The Covenant of the Goddess operates largely by consensus and maintains strict autonomy for all members.

==History==
The CoG began in 1975 when Wiccan elders of various traditions gathered to form an organization for all Witchcraft practitioners. At this meeting, they drafted a covenant and bylaws. That same year on the [[Summer Solstice]], 13 covens ratified the bylaws. It was incorporated on [[Halloween]] (or [[Samhain]]) 1975, as a non-profit religious organization in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cog.org/about-cog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
At each [[Sabbat (neopaganism)|Sabbat]] the group publishes a newsletter. The newsletter is available free in electronic form on the CoG website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cog.org]&lt;/ref&gt; A hard copy [[subscription]] is also available for a nominal fee to cover production and mailing costs.

CoG has been active in the modern Interfaith Movement. Representatives of Covenant of the Goddess attended the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in Chicago, Illinois, in 1993; Cape Town, South Africa, in 1999; and Barcelona, Spain, in 2004. Members of the Covenant are also active in the [[United Religions Initiative]], the [[North American Interfaith Network]] and many other interfaith groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cog.org/interfaith/ The Covenant of the Goddess and the Interfaith Movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

CoG was involved in the campaign to have the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] recognize the [[pentacle]] as suitable for [[headstone]] markers; see also [[Sgt. Patrick Stewart]]. On April 23, 2007, the VA added the pentacle to the list of emblems allowed in national cemeteries and on VA-issued headstones, markers, and plaques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/anderson.cooper.360/blog/2007/04/should-military-restrict-religious.html "Should Military Restrict Religious Symbols?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The group organizes and sponsors an annual [[Religious festival|festival]] called "Merry Meet",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cog.org/about-cog/merry-meet-and-grand-council]&lt;/ref&gt; held in conjunction with the annual business meeting. Representatives from all the member Covens congregate and decide on relevant issues affecting the organization, and Wiccans in general. The business meeting is called the "Grand Council", and is run in a consensus format. There are also workshops, vendors and shopping. As is common with many Wiccan festivals, there are also community rituals and spiritual connections, which play a large part in the festival.

The group created and administers several [[Religious emblems programs|religious emblem programs]] for youth and adults working with youth organizations such as the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]].  The programs are "Over the Moon" for ages 8–11, "Hart and Crescent" for ages 12–18, and the Distinguished Youth Service Award for adults working with youth. Service to the Military and the greater Pagan and Heathen communities is also honored annually at the Merry Meet festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cog.org/awards]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the scarcity of units chartered by Wiccan organizations the Boy Scouts of America has declined to recognize these programs. As a result, members cannot wear it officially on their uniform. For further information, see [[Religious emblems programs (Boy Scouts of America)]].

== Code of Ethics ==
The group operates by a Code of Ethics, which all members (covens or solitary) are expected to understand and follow:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*An ye harm none, do as ye will.
*Since our religion and the arts and practices peculiar to it are the gift of the Goddess, membership and training in a local coven or tradition are bestowed free, as gifts, and only on those persons who are deemed worthy to receive them. However, a coven may expect each of its members to bear a fair share of its ordinary operating expenses.
*All persons have the right to charge reasonable fees for the services by which they earn a living, so long as our religion is not thereby exploited.
*Every person associated with this Covenant shall respect the autonomy and sovereignty of each coven, as well as the right of each coven to oversee the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical development of its members and students in its own way, and shall exercise reasonable caution against infringing upon that right in any way.
*All persons associated with this Covenant shall respect the traditional secrecy of our religion.
*Members of this Covenant should ever keep in mind the underlying unity of our religion as well as the diversity of its manifestations.
*These ethics shall be understood and interpreted in light of one another, and especially in light of the traditional laws of our religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cog.org/about-cog/additional-information]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Organization==
Membership in the Covenant is open to covens and solitary practitioners (solitaires)  that meet the requirements. Requirements include: subscribing to the Covenant's code of ethics, worship of the Goddess and the Old Gods, pledging to abide by the charter, bylaws and policy of the Council, and agreeing to "hold harmless" any committee or committee member of the Covenant.&lt;ref name=Cogbylaws&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512150950/http://www.cog.org/general/07Bylaws.pdf Covenant of the Goddess Bylaws 2007], Article 2: Membership and Affiliation, pages 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Covenant is a confederation of member covens and solitaires. An annual Grand Council is held to make decisions for the whole organization, and members also cooperate in local councils which have at least three covens. Decisions at all levels are made by a formal consensus process.&lt;ref name=consensus&gt;For detailed information on the consensus process, see [http://www.cog.org/content/docs/consensus.pdf Formal Consensus: A Model for Management and Community Organization]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Credentials===
The Covenant recognizes two levels of clergy: priest or priestess and high priest or high priestess.&lt;ref name=Cogbylaws17&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512150950/http://www.cog.org/general/07Bylaws.pdf Covenant of the Goddess Bylaws 2007], Article 7: Credentials, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Covenant solemnizes the lifelong relationships of members in "handfasting" ceremonies. Handfasting is not limited to traditional marriages, as any number of people regardless of gender may commit themselves to a lifelong relationship.

{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}
A '''diocesan administrator''' is a provisional [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] of a [[Roman Catholic]] [[particular church]].

==Diocesan administrators in canon law== 
The [[college (canon law)|college]] of [[consultors]] elects an administrator within eight days after the [[episcopal see|see]] is known to be [[sede vacante|vacant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1G.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 421 §1].&lt;/ref&gt; The college must elect as administrator a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] or [[bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] at least 35 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1G.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 425 §1]. The word used in the canon (''sacerdos'') is not limited to a priest and applies also to a bishop.&lt;/ref&gt; If the college of consultors fails to elect a priest of the required minimum age within the time allotted, the choice of diocesan administrator passes to the [[metropolitan archbishop#Roman Catholic|metropolitan archbishop]] or, if the metropolitan see is vacant, to the senior by appointment of the [[suffragan bishop]]s of the [[ecclesiastical province#Catholic Church|ecclesiastical province]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1G.HTM Code of Canon Law, canons 421 §2 and 425 §3].&lt;/ref&gt;

If a diocese has a [[coadjutor bishop]], the coadjutor succeeds immediately to the episcopal see upon the previous bishop's death or resignation, and there is no vacancy of the see. The see also does not become vacant if the Pope appoints an [[apostolic administrator]].

Before the election of the diocesan administrator of a vacant see, the governance of the see is entrusted, with the powers of a [[vicar general]], to the [[auxiliary bishop]], if there is one, or to the senior among them, if there are several, otherwise to the college of consultors as a whole. The diocesan administrator has greater powers, essentially those of a bishop except for matters excepted by the nature of the matter or expressly by law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1G.HTM Code of Canon Law, canons 426-427]&lt;/ref&gt; Canon law subjects his activity to various legal restrictions and to special supervision by the college of consultors (as for example canons 272 and 485). The diocesan administrator remains in charge until a new bishop takes possession of the see or until he presents his resignation to the college of consultors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1G.HTM Code of Canon Law, canons 430]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Bishops ruled more than one bishopric for long. In any beside their primary bishopric, they would have to be called an ''administrator''. Nevertheless, in local tradition often they are called bishops in all their bishoprics.

An [[episcopal conference]] can transfer the functions of the consultors to the [[cathedral chapter]].&lt;ref&gt;Codex Iuris Canonici Canon 502 § 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In those countries in which the episcopal conference has transferred the functions, the cathedral chapter, and not the consultors, elect the diocesan administrator.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Codex Iuris Canonici Canon 421 § 1 (noting that the consultors elect the administrator, "without prejudice to the provisions of can. 502 §3").&lt;/ref&gt; Capitular election was the default rule before the adoption of the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]];&lt;ref&gt;Codex Iuris Canonici Canons 431–432 (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; this old default rule is reflected in the term for the equivalent of a diocesan administrator in the 1917 code: '''vicar capitular'''.

==Administrators of prince-bishoprics== 
Since the [[Investiture Controversy]] in 11th and 12th centuries the [[cathedral chapter]]s used to elect the Catholic bishops in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. [[Prince-bishopric]]s were [[elective monarchies]] of [[imperial immediacy]] within the Empire, with the monarch being the respective bishop usually elected by the chapter and confirmed by the Holy See, or exceptionally only appointed by the Holy See. Papally confirmed bishops were then invested by the emperor with the princely [[regalia]], thus the title prince-bishop. However, sometimes the respective incumbent of the see never gained a papal confirmation, but was still invested with the princely power. Also the opposite occurred with a papally confirmed bishop, never invested as prince.

Candidates elected, who lacked [[canon law|canon-law]] prerequisites and/or papal confirmation, would officially only hold the title diocesan '''administrator''' (but nevertheless colloquially be referred to as prince-bishop). This was the case with Catholic candidates, who were elected for an [[episcopal see]] with its revenues as a mere [[appanage]] and with all Protestant candidates, who all lacked either the necessary vocational training or the papal confirmation.

==Protestant "elected bishops"==
With many capitulars converting to [[Lutheranism]] or [[Calvinism]] during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the majorities in many chapters consisted of Protestant capitulars. So they then also elected Protestants as bishops, who usually were denied papal confirmation. However, in the early years of Reformation, with the [[Schism (religion)|schism]] not yet fully implemented, it was not always obvious, who tended to Protestantism, so that some candidates only turned out to be Protestants after they had been papally confirmed as bishop and imperially invested as prince. Later, when Protestants were usually denied papal confirmation, the emperors nevertheless invested the unconfirmed candidates as princes - by a so-called [[liege indult]] ({{lang-de|Lehnsindult}}) - due to political coalitions and conflicts within the empire, in order to gain candidates as imperial partisans.

Many Protestant candidates, elected by the capitulars, neither achieved papal confirmation nor a liege indult, but nevertheless, as a matter of fact held de facto princely power. This was because the emperor would have to use force to bar the candidates from ruling, with the emperors lacking the respective power or pursuing other goals. A similar situation was in a number of [[imperial abbey|imperially immediate abbey]]s with their prince-abbots and princess-abbesses. 
 
Unconfirmed incumbents of the sees were called ''Elected Bishops'' or ''Elected Archbishops''. The information that Protestant clerical rulers would generally have been called administrators, as written in several encyclopedies, does not fit historically documented practice.&lt;ref&gt;Eike Wolgast: Hochstift und Reformation. Studien zur Geschichte der Reichskirche zwischen 1517 und 1648, Stuttgart 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In their dioceses as well as in their territories, they had almost the same power as Catholic prince-bishops. However, one common restriction was that administered prince-bishoprics were denied to emit their deputees to the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|diets of the Empire]] or of the [[imperial circle]]s ({{lang-de|Reichstag, or Kreistag}}, respectively). This restriction was abandoned by the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, when the emperor accepted Protestant administrators as fully empowered rulers. However, the Peace also [[secularisation|secularised]] many of the prior Protestant prince-bishoprics and transformed them into [[hereditary monarchies]].

'''Fellow Student''' ([[Hebrew]]: '''תלמיד חבר''') was a [[Talmud]]ist epithet commonly used to describe the interim status of a disciple between the status of being merely a disciple of a teacher Rabbi and being practically equal in status. In many cases, a Fellow Student didn't fall short of his Rabbi, however he continues to perceive his teacher Rabbi above him and continues to learn from him. The term was commonly used in the [[Talmud]] times, however, the usage was continued throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and in latter times.

The [[Constitution of Uzbekistan|Constitution]] provides for [[freedom of religion]] and for the principle of separation of church and state; however, the Government continued to restrict these rights in practice. The Government permits the operation of what it considers mainstream religious groups, including approved [[Muslim]] groups, [[Jewish]] groups, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and various other [[Christian]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]], such as [[Roman Catholics]], [[Lutherans]], and [[Baptists]]. [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] society generally tolerates Christian churches as long as they do not attempt to win converts among ethnic Uzbeks; the law prohibits or severely restricts activities such as [[proselytizing]], importing and disseminating religious literature, and offering private [[religious instruction]].

The status of religious freedom remained restricted with a specific decline for some [[Pentecostal]] and other Christian groups during the period of this report. A number of minority religious groups, including congregations of some Christian denominations, continued to operate without registration because they had not satisfied the strict registration requirements set out by the law. As in previous periods, [[Protestant]] groups with ethnic Uzbek members reported operating in a climate of harassment and fear. Using new criminal statutes enacted in 2006, the Government brought criminal charges against two pastors. One was sentenced to 4 years in a labor camp; the other received a suspended sentence and probation. Law enforcement officials raided and harassed some unregistered groups, detaining and fining their leaders and members. The Government continued its campaign against unauthorized Islamic groups suspected of extremist sentiments or activities, arresting numerous alleged members of these groups and sentencing them to lengthy jail terms. Many of these were suspected members of [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] (HT), a banned extremist Islamic political movement, the banned Islamic group [[Akromiya]] (Akromiylar), or unspecified "[[Wahhabi]]" groups. The Government generally did not interfere with worshippers attending sanctioned mosques and granted approvals for new Islamic print, audio, and video materials. A small number of "underground" mosques operated under the close scrutiny of religious authorities and the security services.

Religious groups enjoyed generally tolerant relations; however, neighbors, family, and employers often continued to pressure ethnic Uzbek Christians, especially recent converts and residents of smaller communities. There were several reports of sermons against missionaries and persons who converted from Islam. A Pentecostal deacon was severely beaten after his church was prominently featured in a documentary on state television directed against Christian evangelicals. Unlike in previous periods, there was only one report of individuals being charged with the distribution of HT leaflets, which often contain strong [[anti-Semitic]] rhetoric, during the period of this report.

==Religious demography==
{{main|Religion in Uzbekistan}}

The country has an area of {{convert|172742|sqmi|km2}} and an estimated population of 27.8 million. International experts believe the population has sustained a loss of 2 to 3 million in recent years due to the growing trend of labor migration from [[Uzbekistan]] to neighboring countries, [[Russia]], [[South Korea]], and the [[Middle East]]. Approximately 80 percent of the population is ethnic Uzbek; 5.5 percent Russian; 5 percent [[Tajik people|Tajik]]; 3 percent [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]]; 2.5 percent [[Karakalpaks|Karakalpak]]; and 1.5 percent [[Tatar]]. There are no official statistics on membership in various religious groups; however, it is estimated that up to 90 percent of the population is nominally [[Sunni Muslim]], of the [[Hanafi]] school. Shi'a Muslims, who are concentrated in the provinces of [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]], constitute an estimated 1 percent of the population. Approximately 5 percent of the population is Russian Orthodox, a percentage that declines as the number of ethnic Russians and other [[Slavs]] continue to emigrate. A growing number of Muslims and Russian Orthodox adherents actively practice their religion. Outside of [[Tashkent]], practicing Muslims are now in the majority. During the period covered by this report, [[mosque]] attendance noticeably increased, particularly among younger men, who tend to constitute the majority of worshippers. The remaining 3 percent of the population includes small communities of Roman Catholics, [[Christianity in Korea|Korean Christians]], [[Baptists]], [[Lutherans]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], evangelical and [[Pentecostal Christians]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Zoroastrians]], [[Buddhists]], [[Baha'is]], and [[Hare Krishnas]], as well as [[atheists]]. In addition, an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 [[Ashkenazi]] and [[Bukharan Jews]] remain in the country, concentrated in the cities of Tashkent, Bukhara, and Samarkand. At least 80,000 others have emigrated to [[Israel]] and the [[United States]] over the past two decades.

==Status of religious freedom==
===Legal and policy framework===
The Constitution provides for freedom of religion; however, the Government and laws restricted these rights in practice. The Constitution also establishes the principle of separation of church and state. The Government prohibits religious groups from forming political parties and social movements.

The [[Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organizations]] (1998 Religion Law) provides for freedom of worship, freedom from religious persecution, separation of church and state, and the right to establish schools and train clergy; however, the law grants those rights only to registered groups. It also restricts religious rights that are judged to be in conflict with national security, prohibits proselytizing, bans religious subjects in public schools, prohibits the private teaching of religious principles, and requires religious groups to obtain a license to publish or distribute materials. The [[Committee on Religious Affairs]] (CRA), an agency accountable to the Cabinet of Ministers, must approve all religious literature.

The [[1998 Religion Law]] requires all religious groups and congregations to register, and provides strict and burdensome criteria for their registration. Among its requirements, the law stipulates that each group must present a list of at least one hundred citizen members to the local branch of the [[Ministry of Justice (Uzbekistan)|Ministry of Justice]] (MOJ). This provision enables the Government to ban any group by finding technical grounds for denying its registration petition. The CRA oversees registered religious activity. New mosques continued to face difficulties gaining registration, as did those closed previously that reapplied.

The law prohibits religious groups from training religious personnel if they do not have a registered central administrative body. Registration of a central body requires registered religious groups in 8 of the country's 13 provinces, an impossible requirement for most religious groups. There are six such entities that may legally train religious personnel. The law limits religious instruction to officially sanctioned religious schools and state-approved instructors. The law permits no private instruction and provides for fines for violations. The law prohibits the teaching of religious subjects in [[State school|public schools]].

Article 14 of the Religion Law prohibits the wearing of "cult robes" (religious clothing) in public places by all except "those serving in religious organizations."

The Criminal and Civil Codes contain stiff penalties for violating the Religion Law and other statutes on religious activities. In addition to the prohibited activities that include organizing an illegal religious group, the law also proscribes persuading others to join such a group and drawing minors into a religious organization without the permission of their parents. Any religious service conducted by an unregistered religious organization is illegal.

The Criminal Code formally distinguishes between "illegal" groups, which are those that are not registered properly, and "prohibited" groups, such as the extremist Islamist political party [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] (HT), [[Tabligh Jamoat]], and other groups branded with the general term "Wahhabi" that are banned altogether. The code makes it a criminal offense, punishable by up to 5 years in prison, to organize an illegal religious group or to resume the activities of such a group after it has been denied registration or ordered to disband. In addition, the code punishes participation in such a group with up to 3 years in prison. The code also provides penalties of up to 20 years in prison (if the crime results in "grave consequences") for "organizing or participating" in the activities of religious extremist, fundamentalist, separatist, or other prohibited groups. In the past, courts often ignored the distinction between illegal and prohibited groups, and frequently convicted members of unapproved Muslim groups under both statutes. There were no reports of such practices during the reporting period.

The main laws under which authorities charge citizens for religious activity are article 159 (anti constitutional activity); article 216 (illegal establishment of public associations or religious organizations); article 216, section 2 (violation of legislation on religious organizations, including proselytism); article 244, section 1 (production and distribution of materials that create a threat to public security and public order); and article 244, section 2 (establishment, direction of, or participation in religious extremist, separatist, fundamentalist, or other banned organizations) of the Criminal Code. Citizens charged under these sections (particularly article 244, Section 2) are frequently charged with being members of HT.

December 2005 amendments to both the Criminal Code (article 217 Part 2) and Administrative Code (article 201) increased fines for repeated offenses of violations of the law on religious activity, raising them to 200 to 300 times the minimum monthly wage of $10 (12,420 soum) under the Criminal Code and 50 to 100 times the minimum wage under the Administrative Code.

June 2006 amendments to the Administrative Code punish "illegal production, storage, import or distribution of materials of religious content" with a fine of 20 to 100 times the minimum monthly wage for individuals, or 50 to 100 times the minimum monthly wage for officials of organizations, together with confiscation of the materials and the "corresponding means of producing and distributing them." Criminal Code article 244-3 addresses the same offense, punishing those already convicted under the corresponding article of the Administrative Code with a fine of 100 to 200 times the minimum monthly wage, or corrective labor of up to 3 years. Other changes introduced simultaneously to the Criminal and Administrative Codes punish the production and distribution of "literature promoting racial and religious hatred."

Although the law treats all registered religious denominations equally, the Government funds an Islamic university and the preservation of Islamic historic sites. In 2007, to mark Tashkent's designation as one of four [[Capitals of Islamic Culture]] by the [[Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (ISESCO), the Government funded a major expansion of the [[Muslim Board of Uzbekistan]] (Muftiate) offices and a large new mosque and library in the complex. The Government provided logistical support for 5,000 selected Muslims to participate in the [[Hajj]], an increase from 4,200 the previous year, but the pilgrims paid their own expenses. The Government controls the [[Mufti]]ate, which in turn controls the Islamic hierarchy, the content of [[imam]]s' sermons, and the volume and substance of published Islamic materials. The [[Kurbon Hayit]] and [[Roza Hayit]] Islamic holy days are observed as national holidays.

The Government still did not implement any of the recommendations of a [[2003 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) [[Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights]] (ODIHR) expert panel that reviewed the 1998 Religion Law and associated statutes and concluded that they were in violation of the international norms for religious freedom. The OSCE recommended lifting the bans on proselytizing and private religious instruction and decriminalizing activities of unregistered religious organizations.

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
There were significant governmental restrictions on religious freedom during the period covered by this report. The Government, by continuing to deny registration to some religious groups and by deregistering others, deprived them of their legal right to worship. The Government restricted many religious practices and activities, punishing some citizens because they engaged in religious practices in violation of the registration laws.

While somewhat supportive of moderate Muslims, the Government, citing national security concerns, bans Islamic organizations it deems extremist and criminalizes membership in them. Chief among the banned organizations are Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT), the [[Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan]] (IMU), [[Akromiya]], [[Tabligh Jamoat]], and various groups the Government broadly labeled Wahhabi. The Government states that it does not consider repression of persons or groups suspected of extremism to be a matter of religious freedom, but rather of preventing armed resistance to the Government.

HT is an extremist Islamist political organization that promotes hate and praises acts of terrorism, while maintaining that it is committed to nonviolence. The party's virulently anti-Semitic and anti-Western literature and websites call for the overthrow of secular governments, including those in Central Asia, to be replaced with a worldwide Islamic government referred to as the Caliphate. Because HT is primarily a political organization, albeit one motivated by religious ideology, and because it does not condemn terrorist acts by other groups, authorities' actions to restrict HT and prosecute its members are not a restriction on religious freedom per se. Nor are restrictions on the IMU, a group of Namangan origin on the U.S. list of international terrorist organizations and believed to be responsible for a series of fatal bombings in the country in 1999 and 2004. Religious freedom concerns arise when innocent persons are accused of membership in these groups based solely on their religious beliefs or practice and convicted without due process.

The Government has repressed and prosecuted members of Akromiya ([[Akromiylar]]) since 1997. Religious experts claim that Akromiya is an informal association that promotes business along Islamic religious principles, while the Government claims that the group is a branch of HT and that it attempted, together with the IMU, to overthrow the Government through armed rebellion in Andijon in May 2005.

Tabligh Jamoat is an Islamic missionary group with origins in South Asia whose worship, dress, and grooming practices are based on practices from the time of [[Muhammad]]; its members claim to be exclusively religious and apolitical.

Other banned groups include alleged "Wahhabists," a term used loosely in the country for any conservative Muslims. In particular the Government uses "Wahhabist" to describe Muslims who worship outside state-approved institutions, who were educated at [[madrassah]]s abroad, or those followers of either [[Imam Abduvali Mirzaev of Andijon]], who disappeared in 1995, or [[Imam Abidkhan Nazarov]] of Tashkent, who fled to Kazakhstan in 1998 to avoid arrest and was granted refugee status by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] on March 15, 2006.

In previous reporting periods, sources claimed that authorities required imams of registered mosques to submit lists of individuals in their congregations who may have extremist tendencies. There were no such reports in this reporting period, but there were reports that the Government instructed some mahalla (neighborhood) committees and imams to identify local residents who could potentially become involved in extremist activity or groups, including those who prayed daily or otherwise demonstrated active devotion. The Government controls the content of imams' sermons and the volume and substance of published Islamic materials.

The Government's harsh treatment of suspected religious extremists has discouraged many religious believers from showing outward expressions of religious piety. Following the May 2005 violence in [[Andijon]], authorities arrested many Andijon-area residents on charges of religious extremism. In this reporting period, there were also credible accounts of [[mahalla]] committee chairmen actively discouraging residents from worshipping in mosques. Forum 18 News Service also reported in November 2006 that authorities distributed instructions to imams about the undesirability of children attending mosques and that police on occasion prevented children from attending Friday prayers.

Many sources reported that the atmosphere in the Muslim community has since improved, however, with many mosques overflowing into the streets for lack of space during Friday prayer. The Government has loosened its grip on observant Muslims, allowing individuals to practice their faith within a controlled environment. Nevertheless, there were accounts of law enforcement and national security officers actively monitoring and reporting on mosque activities and those of worshippers. There were also reports that local officials in Tashkent conducted a series of meetings with mahalla leaders to discourage Islamist tendencies. At these meetings officials allegedly called on families to discourage their sons from attending mosque and their daughters from wearing the [[hijab]] and also instructed neighborhood leaders to discourage the performance of traditional [[Islamic wedding ceremonies]]. The Government limited the number of Hajj pilgrims to 5,000, or approximately 20 percent of the country's total possible number of pilgrims (estimated at approximately 25,000 pilgrims or 1,000 pilgrims for every 1 million of population). Potential pilgrims were reportedly approved by local Mahalla committees, district administrations, the [[National Security Service (Uzbekistan)|National Security Service]], and the state-run [[Hajj Commission]].

Many in the Government expressed suspicion of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], viewing it as an extremist group. Internal police training documents continue to list the Jehovah's Witnesses, along with the IMU and HT, as security threats. Local officials and representatives of the religious establishment continued to express apprehension about the group's missionary activities. On November 30 and December 1, 2006, state television broadcast a documentary entitled "Hypocrisy" that linked Jehovah's Witnesses with the Japanese [[cult]] [[Aum Shinrikyo]].

Some mosques continued to have difficulty registering. Forum 18 reported in 2003 that the [[Panjera Mosque]] in [[Namangan]], where approximately 500 persons used to meet for prayer on feast days, was closed by authorities in 1998 and tried unsuccessfully for several years to register. Several mosques in the southern and eastern [[Ferghana Valley]], which had reported similar registration problems in past years, remained unregistered despite having the required number of congregants to register. Worshipers of the locally funded [[Tuman Mosque]] in [[Akhunbabayev District]] of Ferghana continued to function after court-enforced registration in early 2004. A small number of unofficial, independent mosques are allowed to operate quietly under the watch of official imams.

The Jehovah's Witnesses applied for registration at local, regional, and national levels and either received a denial or no official answer during the period covered by this report. Other churches remained unregistered after unsuccessful efforts in past years to register. These included [[Bethany Baptist Church (Tashkent)|Bethany Baptist Church]] in the [[Mirzo-Ulugbek District]] of Tashkent, the Pentecostal Church in [[Chirchik]], [[Greater Grace Christian Church]] in Samarkand, and [[Emmanuel Church of Nukus]], [[Karakalpakstan]]. Despite a number of international appeals and formal legal appeals in past reporting periods, the Mir (Peace) Church of Nukus, the Hushkhabar Church in Guliston, the Pentecostal Church in Andijon, and the Baptist Church in Gazalkent also remained unregistered.

Approximately 20 Protestant churches previously operated in Karakalpakstan; however, it was unknown how many of these were still active. No Baptist church has successfully registered since 1999. Out of the 11 Jehovah's Witnesses groups in the country, only 1, in Chirchik, was registered at the end of the reporting period. On August 24, 2006, the Government canceled the registration status of the Jehovah's Witnesses' Ferghana congregation, citing several violations of the Religion Law, including proselytizing, inciting religious enmity, and holding meetings in a private home. The Jehovah's Witnesses appealed the decision, but remained unregistered at the end of the reporting period.

As of May 1, 2007, the Government had registered 2,227 religious congregations and organizations--an increase of 3 from 2,224 recorded in July 2006. Mosques, Muslim educational institutions, and Islamic centers comprised 2,046 of the total registered, an increase of 4. Among the Muslim groups were several Shi'a congregations. The number of registered Christian groups decreased by 1. The 181 registered minority religious groups included 58 Korean Christian, 36 Russian Orthodox, 23 Baptist, 21 Pentecostal ("Full Gospel"), 10 Seventh-day Adventist, 8 Jewish, 5 Roman Catholic, 6 Baha'i, 3 Lutheran, 4 "[[New Apostolic]]," 2 [[Armenian Apostolic]], 1 Jehovah's Witnesses, 1 Krishna Consciousness group, 1 Temple of Buddha, and 1 [[Christian "Voice of God" Church]].

During the reporting period, some churches, particularly evangelical churches with ethnic Uzbek members, did not apply for registration because they did not expect local officials to register them. Other groups, including those with too few members, reported that they preferred not to bring themselves to the attention of authorities by submitting a registration application that obviously would not meet legal requirements. Some groups also did not want to give the authorities a list of their members, especially ethnic Uzbeks, as they were harassed during previous attempts to register. A few groups refused on principle to seek registration because they challenge the Government's right to require registration.

To register, groups also must report in their charter a valid legal address. In this reporting period, local officials denied approval of legal addresses or did not answer such requests, thus preventing religious groups from registering. The MOJ also cited this requirement in explaining local officials' decisions. On May 11, 2007, the Sergely district administration in Tashkent denied approval of a legal address for Tashkent's Jehovah's Witnesses congregation. Over the course of this reporting period, Jehovah's Witnesses in Samarkand, Kagan (Bukhara Province), [[Jizzak]] and [[Angren, Uzbekistan|Angren]] also requested approval of legal addresses but received no response. On August 24, 2006, the Ferghana provincial [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] deregistered the Jehovah's Witnesses congregation partly for failing to register a change in their legal address. The Ferghana congregation explained to the authorities that they had purchased a new house and were in the process of registering the new address when their registration was revoked. Members of the congregation were also accused of proselytizing. On June 12, 2007, the Ferghana congregation again requested approval of a legal address, but their request was denied. Some groups, such as the Tashkent International Church, were reluctant to purchase property without assurance that their registration would be approved. Others claimed that local officials arbitrarily withhold approval of the addresses because they oppose the existence of Christian churches with ethnic Uzbek members.

Other problems preventing registration in the past included claims of falsified congregation lists; problems certifying addresses; improper certification by fire inspectors, sanitation workers, and epidemiologists; grammatical errors in the Uzbek text of a group’s charter; and other technicalities.

The [[International Church of Tashkent]], a Protestant nondenominational church that ministers exclusively to Tashkent's international community, cannot qualify for registration, as it does not meet the legal requirement of 100 citizen members. It holds services regularly, without obstruction, in an officially registered Baptist church.

Local authorities continued to pressure Baptist churches associated with the [[International Council of Churches of Evangelical Christians/Baptists]], a denomination that rejects registration on principle, with demands to register their congregations.

Due to the Government's policy against proselytizing, ethnic Russians, Jews, and non-Muslim foreigners enjoy greater religious freedom to choose and change their religion than Muslim ethnic groups, particularly ethnic Uzbeks. Most Christian churches can operate freely as long as they do not attempt to win converts among ethnic Uzbeks. Ethnic Uzbek Christians are often secretive about their faith and sometimes do not attempt to register their organizations due to fear of restrictive reprisals, such as observing to see if they are meeting without benefit of registration, which would lead to arrest under criminal charges. Christian congregations of mixed ethnic background often face difficulties, including rejection of registration or delays in response, or are reluctant to list their ethnic Uzbek members on registration lists for fear of incurring harassment by local officials.

The private teaching of religious principles and the teaching of religion to minors without parental consent is illegal. Only religious groups with a registered central office may legally provide religious instruction.

There are 11 madrassahs (including 2 for women), which provide [[secondary education]] including a full range of secular subjects. In addition, the [[Islamic Institute]] and [[Islamic University in Tashkent]] provide higher educational instruction. The Cabinet of Ministers considers diplomas granted by madrassahs equivalent to other diplomas, thus enabling graduates of those institutions to continue their education at the university level. The curriculum in the madrassahs and Islamic Institute is oriented towards those planning to become imams or religious teachers. This is not the case with the government-funded and established Islamic University, where students pursue religious studies from a secular perspective. While study at the Islamic University does not qualify graduates to practice as imams, some graduates of the university have been appointed imams after pursuing a standard sequence of study at a madrassah.

Apart from full-time study in these institutions, there is no officially sanctioned religious instruction for individuals interested in learning about Islam. An increasing number of imams informally offer religious education; although this is technically illegal, local authorities rarely took legal action. Two madrassahs in the populous and observantly Muslim Ferghana Valley remained closed after the Government converted them to medical facilities.

The Government restricts [[Shi'a]] Islamic education by not permitting the separate training of Shi'a imams inside the country and not recognizing such education received outside the country. However, Shi'a imams are educated in Sunni madrassahs, which offer some courses in Shi'a jurisprudence. The Russian Orthodox Church operates two monasteries (one for women, one for men) and a seminary and offers Sunday school education through many of its churches. Other religious groups offer religious education through their religious centers. The Jewish community has no rabbinate because it does not have synagogues in eight different provinces and therefore cannot meet the requirements for a registered central office; however, the Jewish school in Tashkent's [[Yakkasaroy District]] provides instruction on Jewish culture.

The MOJ controls accreditation, a necessity for anyone attempting to work for a non-governmental organization (NGO) in the country, and has the ability to force out, without bringing formal charges, those it believes are proselytizing. The 1998 Religion Law forbids missionary work of any kind.

Several international faith-based organizations were forced to close in 2006 and 2007 as part of a wave of closures of international NGOs. On September 6, 2006, the Tashkent City Court liquidated the Uzbek branch of the U.S.-based NGO [[Partnership in Academics and Development]] (PAD) after accusing its expatriate staff of proselytizing. On August 23, 2006, the Tashkent City Court ordered the closure of the local branch of the U.S.-based charity Crosslink Development International after the Ministry of Justice accused its employees of conducting missionary activities among Muslims and Orthodox believers. The American-Jewish Joint Distribution Committee faced administrative difficulties in registering local partner organizations because of their connection with a faith-based entity. A 2003 decree of the Cabinet of Ministers outlining a change in registration requirements for NGOs restricted the activities of faith-based entities.

In June 2006 the Government forced the closure of the international NGOs Central Asia Free Exchange (CAFE) and [[Global Involvement Through Education]], after employees of the organizations were accused of engaging in proselytism, and authorities accused both organizations of several other violations of law. Both organizations maintained that their activities were strictly of a humanitarian nature.

Government employees generally display less religious devotion than do citizens in the private sector. The state maintains a policy of secularism, and government employees are under greater scrutiny than others to maintain the separation between religion and state structures.

Unlike previous years, there were no credible reports of heads of mahalla committees threatening Christian converts that they would not be given a cemetery burial if they did not stop attending church.

State-controlled media in some cases encouraged societal prejudice against evangelical Christians. On November 30 and December 1, 2006, state television broadcast a documentary entitled "Hypocrisy" that warned citizens against associating with evangelical Christians, particularly Pentecostals. The television program was followed by a series of articles in the state-controlled press and Internet sites reinforcing this message.

Although the Government requires that the CRA approve all religious literature, in practice a number of other government entities, including the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD), National Security Service (NSS), [[Customs Service]], and police may suppress or confiscate religious literature of which they do not approve. The CRA has restricted the right to publish, import, and distribute religious literature solely to registered central offices of religious organizations, of which seven now exist: an interdenominational [[Bible Society]]; the [[Muslim Board of Uzbekistan]]; two Islamic centers; and Russian Orthodox, Full Gospel, Baptist, and Roman Catholic offices.

In this reporting period, the Government restricted the quantity of Christian literature in the [[Uzbek language]] that registered central religious organizations could import into the country. Authorities also confiscated Christian literature in Uzbek that had been legally imported into the country. In previous reporting periods, government authorities told church leaders that all Christian literature in Uzbek is considered contraband, even if it was legally imported. For historical and cultural reasons, evangelical pastors generally preach in Russian while offering limited services in the Uzbek language--the official national language and the one linked most closely to the majority Muslim population. In this reporting period, the CRA allowed some materials, such as limited quantities of Uzbek translations of some books of the Bible. The Government requires the Bible Society to file regular reports on its printing, importing, and translating activities.

The Government may confiscate and in some cases destroy illegally imported religious literature. In July 2006 the Customs Service detained a shipment of 500 Russian-language Bibles and other literature that had been shipped to the Jehovah's Witnesses congregation in Chirchik, based on the CRA's finding that the literature was not necessary. The literature was impounded through the end of the reporting period and subject to storage charges payable by the Jehovah's Witnesses, despite a request from the organization to reroute the shipment to Kazakhstan. Authorities sometimes burn literature, including Bibles that have been confiscated from members of unregistered religious communities. Forum 18 News Agency reported that following a raid on a Baptist church in Karshi on August 27, 2006, a court ordered the burning of seized Christian literature, including a Bible, hymnbooks, and multiple copies of the Old Testament [[Book of Proverbs]] in Uzbek.

The [[International Post Office in Tashkent]] scrutinizes all incoming packages and sends examples of any religious material to the CRA for further examination and approval. In the event that the CRA bans the materials, it mails a letter to the intended recipient and the sender explaining the rejection by the committee. The CRA has denied entry into Uzbekistan of both Christian and Muslim titles.

The Government tightly controls access to Muslim publications and requires a statement in every domestic publication (books, pamphlets, CDs, and movies) indicating the source of its publication authority. Many books are published with the phrase "permission for this book was granted by the CRA" or "this book is recommended by the CRA," thus indicating official sanction. Generally, only books published under the Muslim Board's imprint "Movarounnahr" contain these phrases. Other works published under the imprint of the state-owned Sharq or Adolat Publishing Houses do not appear to require CRA approval, even when they deal with [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. A few works in Arabic, imported from abroad, are sometimes available from book dealers. More controversial literature, if available, is not displayed, but available only upon request. Possession of literature by authors deemed to be extremists, or of any illegally imported or produced literature, may lead to arrest and prosecution. The Government categorically prohibits HT leaflets.

===Abuses of religious freedom===
{{Original research|section|date=October 2016}}The government continued to commit serious abuses of religious freedom. The government's campaign against extremist Muslim groups resulted in numerous serious human rights abuses during the period covered by this report. The campaign was largely directed at suspected IMU members or other terrorists, as well as suspected HT members. This ongoing campaign has resulted in the arrest of many observant, non-extremist Muslims, as well as allegations, dozens of them confirmed, that law enforcement officials have physically mistreated or tortured hundreds, perhaps thousands over the years.

Authorities often severely mistreat persons arrested on suspicion of extremism, using torture, beatings, and particularly harsh prison conditions, typically sentencing these individuals to 7- to 12-year terms. Some defendants, particularly those also accused of terrorist activity, received sentences of up to 20 years. Even slight involvement with HT, such as attending a Qu'ran study session or possessing an HT leaflet, can draw a sentence of several years' imprisonment.

There were no further developments in the September 2005 death of Islamic cleric [[Shavkat Madumarov]], who died in custody three days after he was sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment for membership in a banned Islamic group. Although specific information was difficult to obtain, human rights and other observers maintained that prisoners frequently die of diseases such as tuberculosis, contracted during their confinement.

In 2004 the Supreme Court issued a decree definitively banning the use of evidence obtained by torture or other illegal means. The government has since taken limited administrative steps to eliminate torture in detention, but there were numerous reports that such treatment remained routine and systematic.

There were no developments in the April 19, 2006, conviction of eight men from the town of [[Yangiyul]], [[Tashkent Province]], on charges of membership in an unregistered religious organization, following a trial at which the defendants testified they had been beaten and tortured. There were also no new developments in the case of nine persons convicted in April 2005 and sentenced to prison terms of 6 to 13 years on religious extremism charges, amid allegations that law enforcement officials tortured them to provoke confessions.

There were no new developments in the following cases: the February 2005 conviction of 2 [[Sufi]] Muslims who claimed that authorities planted HT leaflets on them and tortured them, 23 alleged extremists whose October 2004 convictions were based on testimony police obtained through torture, or the October 2004 criminal conviction of the imam of a Karshi mosque (erroneously cited in the 2005 and 2006 reports as a [[Navoi]] mosque) and 16 members who admitted only to being adherents of Islam.

The Government’s anti-extremism campaign targeted followers of former Tashkent Imam Abidkhan Nazarov, nine of whose followers were deported from Kazakhstan in late November 2005. Uzbekistan courts tried, convicted, and sentenced 7 of them to an average of 6 years' imprisonment on charges of Islamic extremism. Authorities committed the eighth, Shoirmat Shorakhmetov, to an institution for the criminally insane. The ninth, former Tashkent [[Imam Rukhitdin Fakhrutdinov]], was sentenced on September 6, 2006, to 17 years in prison on charges of extremism and involvement in the 1999 Tashkent car bombings. Court guards barred trial monitors from the proceedings. There were no developments in the May 2004 disappearance of Imam Nazarov’s eldest son, [[Husnuddin Nazarov]].

In thousands of cases in previous reporting periods, authorities asserted HT membership based solely on outward expressions of devout belief or have made false assertions of HT membership as a pretext for prosecuting those of moderate religious belief. In this reporting period, authorities targeted individuals whose relatives were already in prison on charges of extremism or have served as witnesses in other trials. Estimates from credible sources in previous reporting periods suggested that as many as 4,500 of the estimated 5,000 to 5,500 political prisoners being held in detention were imprisoned based on alleged HT membership.

During the reporting period, at least 77 persons, and possibly many more, were convicted of membership in HT. In many of these cases there were allegations of torture and coercion or of targeting individuals whose family members were in jail or who had testified as defense witnesses at other HT trials. The circumstances of the other convictions were unclear, as observers were not able to attend many of the trials.

On April 18, 2007, the Tashkent City Criminal Court convicted Gulnora Valijonova of HT membership and sentenced her to 6 years' imprisonment. According to Human Rights Watch and an independent human rights activist, who monitored the trial, the Government failed to provide persuasive proof of her membership in HT and it appeared that she was targeted because several members of her family were in prison on extremist charges.

On October 25, 2006, the Samarkand Province Criminal Court convicted eight men of HT membership and sentenced three defendants to between 5 and 8 years' imprisonment; the remaining defendants were given suspended sentences. Several defendants alleged that their testimony had been coerced under torture, and the trial verdict noted the torture allegations. On September 22, 2006, in a trial closed to journalists and human rights activists, the Tashkent City Court convicted seven men of HT membership and sentenced them to between 10 and 13 years' imprisonment. Although the men confessed to the charges, their lawyers claimed that they confessed only after being threatened by the authorities. On August 3 and August 11, 2006, courts in Tashkent Province convicted a total of 29 men of HT membership in two separate trials and sentenced them to between 1 and 13 years in prison. Several defendants in the two trials testified that their confessions had been coerced through severe beatings. On August 10, 2006, the Tashkent City Criminal Court convicted 5 men of HT membership and sentenced them to between 12 and 15 years' imprisonment. The five defendants alleged in open court that they had been tortured, but the allegations were not investigated by the court. Relatives of the five men also told human rights activists that they were threatened by authorities and ordered not to talk about the case.

The 6 Andijon women who were arrested on April 20, 2006 and charged with possession and dissemination of HT materials were convicted on August 14, 2006 under the Criminal Code and sentenced each to between 5 and 6 years' imprisonment.

It was difficult to estimate precisely the number of persons arrested on false charges of extremism and difficult to know how many of those were under suspicion because of their religious observance. In previous reporting periods, there were accounts of authorities arbitrarily arresting a large percentage of those taken into custody on charges of extremism. Authorities appeared to suspect individuals belonging to Muslim organizations and Muslims who meet privately to pray or study Islam of extremism.

Persons accused of "Wahhabism" faced abuse ranging from job loss to physical abuse and long imprisonment. During the reporting period, at least 25 defendants were convicted on nonspecific charges of affiliation with "Wahhabi" groups in nine separate trials in Tashkent City and Tashkent Province alone. In April 2007, 6 men in [[Surkhandarya Province]] were convicted belonging to a Wahhabist sect and sentenced to between 3 and 6 years' imprisonment. According to a reliable source, the confessions of the defendants were extracted through torture. On February 14, 2007, the Tashkent City Criminal Court convicted two women on charges of "Wahhabism" and subjected them to fines. On December 19, 2006, the Tashkent City Criminal Court convicted Shoakmal Nosirov and Farkhod Muminov of belonging to a Wahhabist sect and sentenced them to between 6 and 9 years' imprisonment. The men were arrested after organizing a camp for 50 children that included Qur'an reading contests. Most of the children's fathers were in prison on religious extremist charges. In a separate trial on September 12, 2006, the Tashkent City Criminal Court convicted nine defendants and sentenced 8 of them to 6 years' imprisonment; the ninth defendant received a sentence of 8 years.

The Government continued to prosecute persons suspected of involvement in the Islamic group Akromiya. According to religious experts, Akromiya is a religious movement that promotes business, not extremism. On February 28, 2007, the Tashkent Province Criminal Court convicted Abdumalik Ibragimov of membership in Akromiya and sentenced him to 8 years' imprisonment. On July 21, 2006, the Tashkent City Criminal Court convicted at least eight, and possibly as many as 45 men, as a group on charges of Akromiya membership. Abdusamat Karimov was sentenced to 8 years' imprisonment. Ilkhomjon Yuldoshev was sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment. The sentences of the other defendants were not reported.

During the reporting period, authorities for the first time sentenced a Christian pastor on criminal charges for religious activities. On January 21, 2007, Andijon authorities arrested pastor [[Dmitry Shestakov]], leader of a registered [[Full Gospel Pentecostal]] congregation. On March 9, 2007, the Andijon Province Criminal Court convicted Shestakov and sentenced him to 4 years in a labor colony on charges of organizing an illegal religious group, inciting religious hatred, and distributing religious extremist literature. After a new trial on May 25, 2007, Shestakov was transferred from an open work camp to a harsher labor camp in Navoi.

There were no developments in the case of alleged Akromiya members Akhad Ziyodkhojayev, Bokhodir Karimov, and Abdubosid Zakirov, convicted in Tashkent on July 25, 2005, of participation in a religious extremist group, along with other charges, and serving sentences of 15.5 to 16 years' imprisonment. There were also no new developments in the case of seven food vendors sentenced in March 2005 in Syrdarya to 8 to 9 years based on their alleged membership in Akromiya.

The Government branded the Islamic missionary group Tabligh Jamoat ("Outreach Society") as extremist. Eleven Tabligh Jamoat members sentenced in October 2004 in Andijon to 5-year terms remained incarcerated; most of the more recent cases resulted in fines, amnesties or light sentences.

In this reporting period, sources noted that some prisoners convicted of religious extremism were held separately from "ordinary" prisoners and were treated more harshly by prison guards. Shortly before their expected release, such prisoners also were retried for organizing extremist cells within prison and had their prison terms extended. In previous reporting periods, there were reports that prison authorities did not allow many prisoners suspected of Islamic extremism to practice their religion freely and, in some circumstances, did not allow them to possess a Qur'an. Prison authorities also often did not permit inmates to pray five times a day or to adjust work and meal schedules for the Ramadan fast. As authorities still did not allow visits by independent outside monitors to places of detention, there was no reliable way of knowing whether these conditions persisted or of verifying reports that religious prisoners were beaten or subjected to especially harsh treatment, such as being isolated or beaten for refusing to sign letters of repentance renouncing what the authorities deemed religious extremism.

Authorities often harass or arrest family members of persons wanted in connection with Islamic political activities or already jailed in connection with those activities. Although there are exceptions, in many cases the relative's only crime is association.

In previous reporting periods, there were several cases in which authorities detained women for participating in or organizing demonstrations demanding the release of male relatives jailed on suspicion of Islamic extremism. There were no such reports in this reporting period; however, authorities appeared to target women whose husbands were in prison. On April 27, 2007, the Tashkent City Criminal Court convicted seven of the eight women arrested for their alleged HT membership but released the seven with suspended sentences. Human Rights Watch stated that although the eight women were accused of forming a HT "cohort," it was clear from witness testimony that the women did not all know each other. The only facts linking the women together were that they all had husbands or close relatives in prison and that they all had testified as witnesses in previous trials. In contrast to previous years, there were no reports that police insulted or forced some women to remove their head coverings.

In previous reporting periods, there were reports that police planted narcotics, ammunition, and religious leaflets on citizens to justify their arrests, and that police arrested many of those with outward signs of religious observance, such as traditional clothing or beards. It was not possible to determine whether the absence of new reports reflected improvement or a decrease in information flow.

There were also reports that authorities tortured and beat evangelical Christians or failed to punish community members who did so. No arrests were made in connection with the December 18, 2006, attack by hired thugs on a Pentecostal Church deacon. There were no new developments in the June 2005 alleged torture of a Pentecostal Christian in Tashkent reported in numerous media outlets.

Any religious service conducted by an unregistered religious organization is illegal. Police occasionally broke up meetings of unregistered evangelical congregations and detained their members. With a few exceptions, authorities often charged those detained with administrative fines of 50 to 100 times the minimum wage.

As in previous years, there were numerous reports that Christian evangelicals were detained, often for a week or more. A reliable source reported that on April 7, 2007, police raided the service of the unregistered Baptist Church of Guliston and detained its pastor, Victor Klimov, who was charged under several articles of the Administrative Code. On February 8, 2007, Samarkand police arrested a Kazakh citizen pastor affiliated with the Greater Grace Church and held him in detention for 11 days.

Hudoer Pardaev and Igor Kim, members of God's Love Pentecostal Church from the Jizzak region, were sentenced on June 12, 2007, to 10 days in prison for "illegally" teaching religion by the Yangiabad District Court.

On January 15, 2007, police in Nukus reportedly raided a Presbyterian church service held in a private home and arrested 18 worshipers. Authorities charged several on violations of the Administrative Code and fined them. One detainee, Salavat Serikbayev, was tried on criminal charges of teaching religion illegally. On May 10, 2007, the Nukus Criminal Court convicted Serikbayev but released him with a 2-year suspended sentence, during which time he is on probation and prohibited from traveling abroad and required to pay 20 percent of his earnings to the state. On April 9, 2007, a second detainee, Pastor Grigory Ten, was fined $490 (621,000 soum) for several violations of the Administrative Code, a large sum for residents of Karakalpakstan.

On August 24, 2006, police raided a house in the village of Uch-kiliz (near Termez) and detained 17 members of the Union of Independent Churches, many of whom were subsequently beaten. Most of the detainees were freed within 24 hours, but five of them were held until September 4, 2006.

In this reporting period, there were several reported instances of the Government raiding services and imposing fines for worshipping, teaching, proselytizing, or other unauthorized religious activity. Although the authorities tolerated the existence of many Christian evangelical groups, they strictly enforced the law's ban on proselytizing, and often harassed, detained or fined those who openly tried to convert Muslims to Christianity. On April 12, 2007, Bukhara provincial authorities fined a local Pentecostal $56 (70,000 soum) on administrative charges of teaching religion without specialized training. On May 16, 2007, two members of Dmitry Shestakov's Full Gospel Church in Andijon were fined approximately $20 (25,200 soum) for obstruction of justice.

During the period of this report, the Government particularly targeted Full Gospel (Pentecostal) churches. This targeting continued a pattern from the previous reporting period. In December 2006 the pastor of the Resurrection Pentecostal Church in Andijon, which had long been denied registration, was fined $85 (109,500 soum) for holding "illegal" meetings. Under intense pressure from local authorities and mahalla leaders, the Resurrection Pentecostal Church decided to close its congregation in June 2007.

A reliable source reported that on December 27, 2006, the Nukus town court fined Makset Djabbarbergenov, the pastor of an unregistered Christian church, $440 (540,000 soum) for several violations of the Administrative Code. On October 25, 2006, six members of the Separated Baptists Church were fined between $85 (108,000 soum) and $430 (540,000 soum) by the Karshi town court for violating article 240 of the Administrative Code. A reliable source reported that on December 7, 2006, the Karshi town court dropped or reduced the fines against four of the members.

A reliable source reported that authorities dropped charges against three members of the Jesus Christ Charismatic Church in Tashkent who were detained for several days in April 2006 while engaged in humanitarian activities at a children's hospital.

Jehovah's Witnesses also came under particular scrutiny and occasionally faced arrest on charges of proselytizing. On June 6, 2007, Dilafruz Arziyeva, a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses Samarkand congregation, was convicted of illegally teaching religion and sentenced to 2 years of corrective labor. On May 14, 2007, another member of the Jehovah's Witnesses Samarkand congregation, Irfan Hamidov, was also convicted of the same charge and sentenced to 2 years' detention in a labor camp after a trial in which witnesses’ testimony favorable to his case was erased from the record.

On April 2, 2007, local police disrupted approximately five Jehovah's Witnesses congregations in three cities during annual worship services commemorating the death of Jesus. There were reports that one worshiper in Samarkand was injured when a police officer beat him on the head. These disruptions were far less severe than in 2006 and 2005, when hundreds of Jehovah's Witnesses were taken into custody, several were reportedly beaten, and many were subjected to large fines and brief administrative detention following raids on annual memorial services in several cities. On February 19, 2008, police officers and local officials of Samarkand raided the homes of Jehovah's Witnesses and took 18 congregation members to the police station. One of the victims was a 17-year-old girl who was reportedly stripped and fondled by an intoxicated police officer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Ozod Saidov, also 17 years old, had his hair pulled and was hit repeatedly on the head. Muhayyo Abdulhakova, a 14-year-old-girl, was interrogated alone and was threatened with being beaten.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Akmaral Rahmonberdiyeva was arrested while she was visiting her friend Yana Karimova. The police searched Karimova's apartment and took them both in for questioning.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

All the victims faced extreme pressure to incriminate fellow members and disclose private information. All were severely abused verbally and were threatened with physical assault. Some of the officers participating in these raids were said to be drunk, as were "eye-witnesses" called on to serve as search witnesses. In many cases, no warrants were provided to justify the raids, nor was legal protocol adhered to. Various personal belongings disappeared from the homes of the individuals searched, including identification papers and employment documents. An infirm 86-year-old woman lay helpless as the police searched her son's home and confiscated their belongings. When the police could not find any Bible literature in Yuriy Khasanov's apartment, they reportedly planted 11 magazines and a brochure in the Uzbek language, and then they arrested him on the pretense that these items belonged to him.

Most of these incidents occurred on February 19. The police and officials who participated have not been held accountable for this string of human rights violations, behavior that indicates a steady deterioration of human rights in Uzbekistan.

There were several cases during the reporting period in which authorities deported members of religious minority groups from the country, presumably based upon their religious affiliation. Forum 18 reported that in mid-June 2007, a Tajik Pentecostal who had lived in the country for more than ten years was deported to Tajikistan. The Pentecostal was arrested after meeting in a church member's house in Tashkent in late May and held in jail for 22 days before being deported. On August 11, 2006, Interior Ministry officers in Tashkent deported Ivan Bychkov, a member of the Bethany Baptist Church, to Russia, reportedly without explanation. Bychkov, a Russian citizen, had been resident in Tashkent for many years. On September 5, 2006, Tashkent authorities deported Viktoria Khrypunova, the Russian-citizen wife of Pastor Sergei Khrypunov of the Bethany Baptist Church. As in Bychkov's case, authorities reportedly gave no explanation for Khrypunova's deportation.

On April 25, 2008, the Samarkand Criminal Court sentenced Olim Turayev, a [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]], to four years in a labor colony for teaching his religious beliefs to others and for organizing illegal religious activity, acts that according to Articles 229-2 and 216 of the Uzbekistan Criminal Code are punishable crimes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Forced religious conversion===
There were no reports of forced religious conversion, including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.

===Improvements and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious Freedom===
Since 2003 the Government has allowed former Mufti Muhammad Sodiq Muhammad Yusuf to publish widely on a variety of religious topics in both print and electronic formats. His popular Islamic website remained unblocked by the Government and he continued to host a popular radio program on Islam and to teach at the Islamic University.

Authorities allowed a small number of unregistered mosques to reopen, both in cities and in the countryside. In addition, non state sanctioned imams continued to work, particularly in rural areas, under the close watch of religious officials. Reports noted that the atmosphere in the Muslim community has improved somewhat, as observant Muslims were allowed to practice their faith within these controlled environments.

The Government continued to respect the military pacifism of Jehovah's Witnesses. The draft board routinely gave exemptions. On April 2, Jehovah's Witnesses throughout Uzbekistan encountered far less harassment than in the past 2 years in the course of their annual memorial services commemorating Jesus' death.

During the period covered by this report, the Government continued to tolerate the use of head coverings by Muslim women. The hijab was seen frequently in Tashkent, the more religiously conservative parts of the Ferghana Valley, and in other regions. The CRA took the position that women should not be barred from educational institutions on the basis of their religious dress and actively assisted women who had been previously expelled to gain readmission to their universities. During the period covered by this report, it was more common to see women on the street wearing the hijab and, much less frequently, the veil.

There were reports of recent cases where authorities have dismissed charges against Protestants after their lawyer protested procedural matters or evidence. Forum 18 reported that in March 2007 prosecutors tried to bring a case against Vyacheslav Tskhe, a youth leader of the registered Grace Pentecostal Church in the Mirzo-Ulugbek District of Tashkent, for several violations of the Administrative Code. However, after Tskhe protested to several state agencies about the actions of a police officer involved in the case, the charges against Tskhe were dropped and the police officer was reprimanded. On February 10, 2007, police raided a house in the town of Gazli (near Bukhara) and detained six members of the Pentecostal Church. The charges against them were later dropped and the arresting police officers disciplined. On February 5, 2007, the Chilanzar District Court in Tashkent dropped charges against five members of the Pentecostal church who had been charged with violating several articles of the Administrative Code.

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
Uzbek society is generally tolerant of religious diversity but not of proselytizing. The population maintained its long tradition of secularism and religious tolerance. In particular, Muslim, Russian Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Jewish leaders reported high levels of acceptance in society. Evangelical or Pentecostal Christian churches and churches with ethnic Uzbek converts encountered difficulties stemming from [[discrimination]]. There were persistent reports that ethnic Uzbeks who converted to Christianity faced discrimination and [[harassment]].

State-controlled media in some cases encouraged societal [[prejudice]] against evangelical Christians. After state television featured a two-part documentary directed against Christian evangelicals in November 2006, members of a leading Tashkent Pentecostal church reported severe harassment and escalating threats from their local community, culminating in a December 18, 2006, attack by hired thugs on a church deacon. Some of the articles in the state-controlled press included quotes from Russian Orthodox clerics criticizing evangelical activity.

There was no pattern of discrimination against Jews. Synagogues, Hebrew education, Jewish cultural events, and the publication of a community newspaper take place openly and undisturbed. Many Jews have emigrated to the United States and Israel, most likely because of bleak economic prospects and connections to families abroad, rather than anti-Jewish sentiment. There are Jewish kindergartens in Tashkent and Samarkand officially teaching Jewish culture. Investigations established that anti-Semitism was not a motive in the February 2006 death of a Tashkent Jewish community leader, Avraam Yagudayev, or the June 2006 killings of a twenty-year-old secretary to prominent Tashkent-based Rabbi David Gurevich, Karina Loifer, and her mother.

Unlike in previous years, there was only one report of individuals being charged with the distribution of HT leaflets, which often contain strong anti-Semitic rhetoric, during the period of this report. On August 10, 2006, the Uzbek Customs Committee stated on a government-run website that two Kazakh citizens were arrested for possessing HT books, magazines and leaflets.

'''The Hindu Temple of St. Louis''' is located in [[Ballwin, Missouri]] and serves over 14,000 Hindus residing in the [[Greater St. Louis|St. Louis Area]]. The temple is located at 725 Weidman Rd, St. Louis, MO, 63011. The current [[Pandit]] of the Hindu Temple is Patabhi Maddipati

==History==
The Hindu Temple of St. Louis was formally registered as a [[Charitable organization|Not For Profit Organization]] in Missouri in 1988. Groundbreaking of the temple commenced on April 21 1990 with a [[Puja (Hinduism)|Bhoomi Pooja]] and by November 8 1991, the temple was completed. The first physical deities were installed in 1995, replacing pictures of deities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.hindutemplestlouis.org/|website = Hindu Temple of St. Louis|title = Hindu Temple of St. Louis|access-date = 25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.archcityreligion.org/the-hindu-temple-of-st-louis/|title = Welcome to the Hindu Temple of Saint Louis|website = Arch City Religion|author = Ajla Ahmetovic|access-date = 25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Mahatma Gandhi Cultural Center was the first building constructed in 1991. In 2000, several sculptors arrived from [[India]] to create ornate details on the [[Gopuram|gopuram]]. In 2008, Hindu Temple of St. Louis bought a nearby housing complex for $3 Million to expand the annex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/hindu-temple-of-st-louis-expansion-plans-vex-neighbors/article_28812f3f-1699-592c-9cb3-0af1f0080c74.html|title = Hindu Temple of St. Louis Expansion Plan Vex Neighbors|website = St. Louis Today|date = 21 May 2011|author = Bogan, Jesse|access-date = 25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This expansion sponsored criticism among local citizens due to the increased traffic, noise pollution and light pollution impacting the citizens that live adjacent to the annex. In 2012, the local subdivision and the temple reached a agreement to build a wall around its newly acquired land and a "15 feet setback"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://patch.com/missouri/townandcountry-manchester/hindu-temple-and-next-door-neighbors-come-to-an-agreement|title = Hindu Temple and Next Door Neighbors come to an agreement|author = Miner, Doug|date = 21 May 2012|access-date = 25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.stlouischurches.org/west-st-louis-mo-churches/ballwin-mo-churches-63011/1303-hindu-temple-of-st-louis|title = Hindu Temple of St. Louis|website = St. Louis Churches|access-date = 25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Campus==
The temple currently consists of a worship place, a cultural center, reception area, a cafeteria, a library, a parking lot and a auditorium.

==Vandalism==
In 2003, two vandals attacked the Hindu Temple with [[Molotov Cocktails]] impacting the front doors but caused no injuries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pluralism.org/news/update-st-louis-hindu-temple-twice-vandalized-suspects-apprehended/|title = update st.louis hindu temple twice vandalized, suspects apprehended|website = Pularlism|access-date = 25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The suspects were later apprehended.

'''Ho Feng-Shan''' ({{zh|t=何鳳山 |s=何凤山 |p=Hé Fèngshān |first=t}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/200511/11/eng20051111_220515.html ''People's Daily'' Online, "Former Jewish refugees revisit Shanghai Ark"]&lt;/ref&gt; September 10, 1901 – September 28, 1997) was a Chinese diplomat for the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. When he was [[Consul-general]] in [[Vienna]] during [[World War II]], he risked his life and career to save more than 3,000 Jews by issuing them visas, disobeying the instruction of his superiors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/article/1163297--unsung-hero-gave-toronto-family-ticket-out-of-nazi-occupied-austria |title=Unsung hero gave Toronto family ticket out of Nazi-occupied Austria |last=Dempsey |first=Amy |date=April 18, 2012 |work=The Toronto Star |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho's actions were recognized posthumously when the [[Israel]]i organization [[Yad Vashem]] in 2000 decided to award him the title "[[Righteous Among the Nations]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/righteous/stories/ho|title=Chinese Visas in Vienna: Feng-Shan Ho|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Yad Vashem|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Ho Feng-Shan's father died when Ho was 7 years old. A diligent and hard-working student, he managed to enter the [[Yali School]] in the provincial capital of [[Changsha]] and later [[Yale–China Association|Yale-in-China University]]. He attended the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] in 1929 and received his [[doctorate]] in [[political economics]] in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Ho Feng Shan: ''[http://www.literature.at/alo?objid=20006 Das Bankwesen in China und seine Probleme]'', Dissertation 1932, University of Munich&lt;/ref&gt;

== During World War II ==

In 1935, Ho started his diplomatic career within the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Republic of China)|Foreign Ministry]] of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. His first posting was in [[Turkey]]. He was appointed First Secretary at the Chinese [[legation]] in Vienna in 1937. When Austria was [[Anschluss|annexed]] by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938, and the legation was turned into a consulate, Ho was assigned the post of [[Consul (representative)|Consul]]-General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.gov.tw/en/News_Content.aspx?n=1EADDCFD4C6EC567&amp;s=31E75C6B67385188|title=Daughter of late ROC Ambassador Ho Feng-shan to receive posthumous tribute for her father|work=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China (Taiwan)|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in 1938, the situation became rapidly more difficult for the almost 200,000 Austrian Jews. The only way for Jews to escape from Nazism was to leave Europe. In order to leave, they had to provide proof of emigration, usually a [[Visa (document)|visa]] from a foreign nation, or a valid boat ticket. This was difficult, however, because at the 1938 [[Évian Conference]] 31 countries (out of a total of 32, which included Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) refused to accept Jewish immigrants. The only country willing to accept Jews was the [[Dominican Jews|Dominican Republic]], which offered to accept up to 100,000 refugees.&lt;ref name =crassweller&gt;{{cite book|author=Crassweller RD|title=Trujillo. The Life and Times of a Caribbean Dictator.|publisher=The MacMillan Co., New York (1966)|pages=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acting against the orders of his superior Chen Jie (陳介), the Chinese ambassador to [[Berlin]], Ho started to issue visas to [[Shanghai]], part of which during this time was still under the control of the Republic of China, for humanitarian reasons. Twelve hundred visas were issued by Ho in the first three months of holding office as Consul-General.&lt;ref&gt;Baruch Tenembaum [http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en/saviors/others/feng-shan-ho-chinese-savior.1304.htm "Feng-Shan Ho, Chinese Savior"], International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time it was not necessary to have a visa to enter Shanghai, but the visas allowed the Jews to leave Austria. Many Jewish families left for Shanghai, whence most of them would later leave for [[Hong Kong]] and [[Australia]]. Ho continued to issue these visas until he was ordered to return to China in May 1940. The exact number of visas given by Ho to Jewish refugees is unknown. It is known that Ho issued the 200th visa in June 1938, and signed the 1906th visa on October 27, 1938. How many Jews were saved through his actions is unknown, but given that Ho issued nearly 2,000 visas only during his first half year at his post, the number may be in the thousands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblediscovered.com/tag/hedy-lamarr Brief profile of  Ho Feng-shan during World War II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707232802/http://www.biblediscovered.com/tag/hedy-lamarr/ |date=2011-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== After the war ==
After the Communist victory in 1949, Ho followed the Nationalist government to Taiwan. He later served as the ambassador from [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] to other countries, including to [[Egypt]], [[Mexico]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Colombia]]. After his retirement in 1973, Ho settled in San Francisco, California, where he wrote his memoirs, ''My Forty Years as a Diplomat'' (外交生涯四十年) published in 1990 (English translation 2010).

After his retirement in 1973, the government on Taiwan denied Ho a pension on the grounds, common then, that he had been subpoenaed and refused to cooperate with Diplomatic Services, and had not properly accounted for a small sum in embassy expense account. These charges are now widely believed to have been politically motivated. The ROC government has never exonerated him as there were many diplomats leaving their posts without authorization. He did not report to work and he was terminated without a pension. This was the policy when tens of embassies were closed. He returned to his native China and visited his [[alma mater]] in [[Changsha]] for school's 80th anniversary in 1986. A shadow was cast over his later years by impeachment by Taipei's Committee on the Discipline of Public Functionaries for having allegedly misappropriated funds when ambassador to Colombia in 1970, charges which he claimed were concocted by a subordinate he had refused to recommend for promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Damien McElroy, "Family fights to clear stigma that haunted China's 'Schindler'", ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', 4 June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, on September 10, 2015, President Ma in Taipei commended Dr. Ho for his service and presented his daughter a certificate of appreciation with Israeli government representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.president.gov.tw/NEWS/4737 |title=President Ma awards posthumous citation to late ROC Ambassador Ho Feng-Shan |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=September 10, 2015 |website=Office of the President, ROC (Taiwan) |access-date=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==

Ho Feng-Shan died in [[San Francisco, California]] at the age of 96.  He was survived by his son, Monto Ho (何曼德), a [[Chinese-American]] professional in [[microbiology]], [[virology]], and [[infectious diseases]]; and by his daughter, Manli Ho (何曼禮).

== Awards ==

Ho's actions in Vienna went unnoticed during his lifetime, save for a black mark in his personnel file for disobeying orders. They were finally recognized, posthumously, when he was awarded the title [[Righteous Among the Nations]] by the [[Israel]]i organization [[Yad Vashem]] at a ceremony in 2001 and honored by [[Boys Town Jerusalem]] in 2004.  In 2015, his daughter represented her father to receive a meritorious certificate for his diplomatic services presented by ROC Government, with participation of representatives from Israel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3111">The '''Institute of Jewish Affairs''' (IJA) was founded in February 1941 as a research institute to provide analysis of political, legal and economic issues affecting Jewish life.

==History==
The Institute of Jewish Affairs was launched and sponsored by the [[World Jewish Congress]] (WJC) and the [[American Jewish Congress]]. IJA’s headquarters were situated in [[New York City]] until 1965 when the institution relocated to [[London]]. In 1994 it was reestablished in London as [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]].&lt;ref&gt;Troen, Selwyn Illan (1999) “Jewish Centers and Peripheries: Europe Between America and Israel Fifty Years After World War II,” Transaction Publishers, p.275.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute’s founder Dr [[Jacob Robinson]] argued that Jewish leaders, struggling for the interests of the Jewry after [[World War I]], “were hampered by the lack of up-to-date information on the situation of the Jews and no less by the lack of research into relevant legal and political options.”&lt;ref&gt;Boaz, Cohen (2010 a). "Dr. Jacob Robinson, the Institute of Jewish Affairs and the Elusive Jewish voice in Nuremberg," David Bankier and Dan Michman (eds.), Holocaust and Justice: representation and Historiography of the Holocaust in Post-War Trials, Yad Vashem and Berghahn Books, Jerusalem, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; The IJA was established to bridge the gap. The Institute’s research focused on the analysis of the political, legal and economic aspects of Jewish life since [[World War I]]. Their reports examined a number of topics including: the situation of Jewish communities in various countries, [[anti-Semitism]], human rights related to minorities and migration, and the [[Holocaust]] and its aftermath.  The organization was also involved in formulating a postwar policy to secure Jewish rights and freedom internationally.

Dr [[Jacob Robinson]], IJA’s founder, served as its first director (1941–1947). He was succeeded by [[Nehemiah Robinson]] (1947–1964) and [[Oscar Karbach]] (1964–1973).&lt;ref name="AJA"&gt;American Jewish Archives (2002) A Collection Overview to the World Jewish Congress Records. 1918-1982 (bulk 1940-1980).

Accessed on-line at: http://americanjewisharchives.org/collections/ms0361/ms0361.html#seriesC on 8.8.2014&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1940s, the organization, together with WJC’s Political Department, was engaged in the preparation of reports submitted to the [[United Nations]] and other organizations.&lt;ref name="AJA"/&gt;

==History of Islam in Trinidad and Tobago==
The first Muslims to arrive in the country arrived from [[Africa]] brought as slaves by the colonists. The second group arrived in 1816 as a small proportion of those of the [[Corps of Colonial Marines]] who were African-born and had been recruited in 1815 in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] during the War of 1812, mostly settled in Fifth and Sixth Companies within the Company Villages near [[Princes Town]]. They were followed by African Muslims among disbanded members of the [[West India Regiment]]s settled between 1817 and 1825 in Manzanilla on the East Coast and in a group of villages south-east of Valencia, and further African Muslims were brought to Trinidad as a result of the [[Royal Navy]]'s interception of slaving ships following the [[Slave Trade Act]]s. From the 1840s, Muslims came from [[South Asia]] as part of the [[Indian indenture system]] to work on sugar cane and [[cacao plantation]]s. Muslims today are mostly of South Asian descent but there are converts from all races. In Trinidad there are Islamic primary and secondary schools. The first Muslim secondary school in the country, [[ASJA Boys' College]], San Fernando, was established in 1960. [[File:Masjid - Hermitage Village, Trinidad and Tobago.jpg|thumb|right|A Mosque in Hermitage Village]]
 
There are many [[mosques]] and [[Eid ul Fitr]] is a public holiday. There are several mosques belonging to the [[Ahmadiyya]] Muslim Community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Ahmadiyya Muslim Mosques Around the World | page=319 | accessdate=June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and 5 mosques belonging to the [[Ahmadiyya Anjuman Isha'at Islam]] Lahore. In 2005, an Islamic television channel [[Islamic Broadcast Network|IBN Channel 8]] was born.  In 2006 [[Darut Tarbiyah The Islamic Network (T.I.N.)|Darut Tarbiyah - The Islamic Network (T.I.N.)]] was established.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5772">'''Jewish magical papyri''' are a subclass of [[papyri]] with specific Jewish magical uses, and which shed light on popular belief during the late [[Second Temple Period]] and after in Late Antiquity. A related category of contemporary evidence are '''Jewish magical inscriptions''', typically on [[amulets]], [[ostraca]], and [[incantation bowls]].

==Jewish magic==
Although magic was forbidden by Levitical law in the [[Hebrew Bible]], it was widely practised in the late Second Temple period, and particularly well documented in the period following the destruction of the temple into the 3rd, 4th, and 5th centuries C.E.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/1798780/Book_Review_Gideon_Bohak_Ancient_Jewish_Magic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Bohak ''Ancient Jewish magic: a history'' 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Wahlen ''Jesus and the impurity of spirits in the Synoptic Gospels'' 2004 p19 "The Jewish magical papyri and incantation bowls may also shed light on our investigation.79 However, the fact that all of these sources are generally dated from the third to fifth centuries and beyond requires us to exercise particular ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish and [[Samaritan]] magicians appear in the [[New Testament]], [[Acts of the Apostles]], and also in the works of [[Josephus]], such as Atomos, a Jewish magician of Cyprus (''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' 20:142).

==Papyri Texts==
The language of the papyri may be:
* [[Aramaic]], as in Bodleian Heb.d83, a small fragment intended for placement in a metal magical amulet, found in [[Oxyrhynchus]] with twelve lines with an invocation "by the eye of [[Shemihaza]]" "for a dog to bite someone".&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Bohak ''Ancient Jewish magic: a history'' 2008 Page 166 "... let us examine three specific instances of Jewish magical papyri, and see what they might contribute to the study of Jewish magic in late antiquity:&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Greeks|Greek]], as a subset of the [[Greek Magical Papyri]] catalogued by Karl Preisendanz and others.&lt;ref&gt;''The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, Including the Demotic Spells'' Hans Dieter Betz - 1997 from [[Papyri Graecae Magicae]]. Die griechischen Zauberpapyri, herausgegeben und übersetzt von Karl Preisendanz, vol. I (Leipzig: Teubner, 1928), vol. ... On Jewish magic and related bibliography, see L. Blau, Das altjudische Zauberwesen&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hebrew]], as Louvre E7020, which relates to Jewish [[Merkabah mysticism|Merkaba]] literature and angelic liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;Bohak, p167&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish magical papyri supplement the evidences for [[angelology]] found in early rabbinic material, for example in identifying the existence of a national angel named Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley Layton ''Studies in the History of Religions'' Volume 22 1972 Page 291 "The existence of an angel Israel is implied in both hellenistic (Jewish) magical papyri and in late Jewish mystical literature, in rabbinic material concerning the name of the angel with whom Jacob wrestled and in Hekhaloth literature ..." reprinted in ''Map is not territory: studies in the history of religions'' ed Jonathan Z. Smith - 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Jewish magical papyri is often syncretic.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Jacobson ''The Exagoge of Ezekiel'' 2009 "Greco-Jewish magical papyri invoke God and Helios in virtually the same breath."&lt;/ref&gt; Some "Jewish magical papyri" may not themselves be Jewish but syncretic invocations of [[Yahweh]] by non-Jews.&lt;ref&gt;G. H. Parke-Taylor - 1975 "The use made of divine names in the semi-Jewish magical papyri of the first four or five centuries is evidence of the way in which potential magical tendencies within the divine name found expression. The sixth century also yields ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amulet and incantation bowl inscriptions==
Although not technically "papyri", inscriptions on amulets and [[incantation bowl]]s offer context. Jewish incantation bowls were collected most notably by [[Shlomo Moussaieff (businessman)|Shlomo Moussaieff]] and the inscriptions analysed by Dan Levene (2002).&lt;ref&gt;In the name of Jesus: exorcism among early Christians p41  Graham H. Twelftree - 2007 CMB 2: two of the twenty Jewish Aramaic bowls Levene transcribes and discusses offered protection against curses and oaths in general, two were for protection against the malicious magic of named enemies, two others were dispensed for ..&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance for research==
The discovery, primarily during the heyday of [[Near Eastern archaeology]] in the late 19th century, and subsequent interpretation and cataloguing, primarily during the early 20th century, has been followed by incorporation into academic research which has allowed Jewish magical papyri and magical inscriptions a supplemental role to major sources such as [[Pseudepigrapha]], [[Apocrypha]], [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], [[Philo]], [[Josephus]], the [[New Testament]], and the [[Talmuds]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Neusner]] ''Religion, literature, and society in ancient Israel, formative Christianity and Judaism'' University Press of America  Volume 2- 1987 "As my introductions to each section in this corpus clarifies, the documents help solidify the importance of Philo, Josephus, the Old Testament Apocrypha, the Qumran Scrolls, and Jewish Magical Papyri"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig A. Evans, Emanuel Tov ''Exploring the origins of the Bible: canon formation in historical Literary, and Theological Perspective'' Acadia Studies in Bible and Theology  2008 "Now, thanks to research by Jews and Christians on the Pseudepigrapha, Apocrypha, Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus, the New Testament, the Jewish magical papyri, inscriptions, and rabbinics, we know that the following is correct about ...

[[Image:Beit Alpha.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Zodiac]] in a 6th-century [[synagogue]] at Beit Alpha, [[Israel]].]]
In Hebrew, [[astrology]] is called ''hokmat ha-mazalot'', "the science of (determining) the ruling planet", (The Planets, The Jews, and the Beginnings of 'Jewish Astrology' , Reimund Leicht) because knowledge of astrology/astronomy was required to determine the ruling planet (of the hour). Knowing the ruling planet of the hour is needed when the blessing "He who has wrought the work of creation" must be recited at the moment of the spring equinox every 28 years:

"Our Rabbis taught: He who sees the sun at its turning point, the moon in its power, the planets in their orbits, and the signs of the zodiac in their orderly progress, should say: Blessed be He who has wrought the work of creation. And when [does this happen] — Abaye said: Every twenty-eight years when the cycle begins again and the Nisan [Spring] equinox falls in (the hour of) Saturn on the evening of Tuesday going into Wednesday. - ''Berochot 59b''"

While not a [[Jewish]] practice or teaching as such, astrology made its way into the Jewish thought as can be seen in the many references to it in the Talmud such as ''Shabbat 156b'': "Rabbi Ḥanina said to his students who heard all this: Go and tell the son of Levi, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: It is not the ruling planet of the day of the week that determines a person’s nature; rather, it is the ruling planet of the hour that determines his nature.  One who was born under the influence of the sun will be a radiant person; he will eat from his own resources and drink from his own resources..."  Thus astrology/astronomy served to determine the hour of Saturn according to the needs of religious observance.  The great erudite rabbis applied their knowledge of planetary rulers to commonplace astrological prognostications.  Astrological statements became accepted and worthy of debate and discussion by Torah scholars.

==In the Hebrew Bible==
[[Astrology]] is not specifically mentioned in the [[Torah]], but there are two commandments which have been used by some authorities as a basis to forbid the practice.
{{quote|"You shall not practice divination or soothsaying." ({{bibleref2|Leviticus|19:26|OJB}})}}
{{quote|"When you enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not learn to imitate the abhorrent practices of the nations. Let no one be found among you who...is an augur, a soothsayer, a diviner, a sorcerer, one casts spells.....For anyone who does these things is abhorrent to the LORD..." ({{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|18:9-12|OJB}})}}

These commandments are understood by some rabbinic authorities{{who|date=October 2012}} as forbidding astrology, while others{{who|date=October 2012}} limit these ''[[mitzvot]]'' to other forms of soothsaying, and thus view astrology as permissible.

{{quote|"And Elohim said, Let there be lights in the raki’a of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for otot (signs), and for mo’adim (seasons), and for yamim (days), and shanim (years)" ({{bibleref2|Genesis|1:14|OJB}})}}

The Hebrew word ''[[mazalot]]'', which literally means "lucks" or "zodiac", is used twice in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Book of Job]] 38:31-33, &amp; [[II Kings]] 23:5&lt;/ref&gt; Specific constellations are also mentioned, such as [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] (named "Kesil" "כסיל", literally: "fool"; possibly etymologically connected with "Kislev", the name for the ninth month of the Hebrew calendar (i.e. November–December), which, in turn, may derive from the Hebrew root K-S-L as in the words "kesel, kisla" (כֵּסֶל, כִּסְלָה, hope, positiveness), that is, hope for winter rains), which is mentioned three times: [[Book of Job|Job]] 9:9 ("He is the maker of the Bear and Orion"), [[Book of Job|Job]] 38:31 ("Can you loosen Orion's belt?"), and [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 5:8 ("He who made the [[Pleiades]] and Orion").

In the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] the [[Nevi'im|prophets]] scoffed at "star-gazers" (''hoverei ha-shamayim'') in {{bibleref2|Isaiah|47:13|OJB}} and {{bibleref2|Jeremiah|10:2|OJB}}. Astrologers from [[Babylon]] were called ''Kasdim/Kasdin'' (Chaldeans) in the [[Book of Daniel]]. In rabbinic literature, the term ''Chaldeans'' later was often used as a synonym with those who practiced astrology.

Some historians{{who|date=October 2012}} hold that astrology slowly made its way into the Jewish community through [[syncretism]] with ancient [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic culture]]. The [[Sibylline oracles]] praise the Jewish nation because it "does not meditate on the prophecies of the fortune-tellers, magicians, and conjurers, nor practice Astrology, nor seek the oracles of the Chaldeans in the stars" (iii. 227); although the author of the ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' article on astrology holds that this view is mistaken.

The early historian [[Josephus]] censures the people for ignoring what he thought were signs foreshadowing the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;("B. J." vi. 5, § 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Apocrypha==
There are many references to astrology in the [[apocrypha]]. The [[Jubilees|Book of Jubilees]] said that [[Abraham]] overcame the beliefs of astrologers by accepting one God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0002_0_01531.html|title=Astrology|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rabbinic rejection==
In early classical rabbinic works written in the land of Israel ([[Jerusalem Talmud]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] [[midrash]] compilations) astrologers are known as ''astrologos'' and ''astrologiyya''. In early classical rabbinic works written in Babylon, astrologers were called ''kaldiyyim'', ''kalda'ei'', and ''iztagninin''.

The Babylonian [[Talmud]] (BT), in Shabbath 156a, records rabbinic mention of character traits associated with one's having been born on specific days of the week. This wink to superstition did not extend to astrology, however, as R. Johanan, the Palestinian amora, is reported to have said "there is no ''mazal'' (literally "star") for Israel, but only for the nations [which recognize the validity of astrology.]" This opinion was shared by Rav (BT Shabbat 156a). Moreover, whereas BT Sanhedrin 65 merely suggests that individual Jews may not consult an astrologer, tractate BT Pesachim 113b clearly states that Jews may not consult astrologers.

Samuel of Babylonia (circa 250 CE) is the only sage in the Talmud who seriously studied astrology, yet he held that it was not compatible with Judaism. Quoting Deuteronomy 30:12, "The Law is not in the Heavens", he is reputed to have taught that "Torah can not go together with the art that studies the heavens" (Midrash Deuteronomy Rabbah 8:6).

A similar remark is made by the Babylonian sage Jose of Hu?al: "We are not permitted to appeal to the Chaldeans, for it is written (Deut. 18:13), 'You shall be perfect with the Lord your God'" (BT Pesachim 113b).

[[Rabbinic literature]] records that [[Rabbi Akiva]] contends against astrological beliefs, e.g., Sifre, Deut. 171; Sifra, Kedoshim, vi.; Sanhedrin 65.

Rabbi Maimonides's mitzvot say that superstitions should not be trusted.

==Rabbinic acceptance==
However, other statements in the Talmud and in the [[midrash]] literature show that many Jews had some level of admiration for astrology.

Some hold that the stars generally do control the fate of people and nations, but Abraham and his descendants were elevated by their covenant with God, and thus achieve an elevated level of [[free will]]. (Midrash Genesis Rabbah 44:12, Yal., Jer. 285). A statement in the [[Tosefta]] (Kiddushin 5:17) holds that the blessing bestowed on Abraham is the gift of astrology. Midrash Ecclesiastes Rabbah states that the rulers of some non-Jewish nations were experts in astrology, and that King Solomon too had expertise in this realm. (7:23 no. 1)

There is a story in the Talmud according to which [[God]] showed to [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] all the future generations, including their scribes, scholars, and leaders (BT Avodah Zarah 5a). According to this source, the biblical Patriarch [[Abraham]] bore upon his breast an astrological tablet on which the fate of every man might be read. Thus, kings are said to have congregated before his door in order to seek advice.

An announcement is found to the effect that it is dangerous to drink water on Wednesday and Friday evenings (Pesachim 112a). Samuel, a physician and astrologer, taught that it was dangerous to bleed a patient on Monday, Tuesday, or Thursday, because on the last-mentioned day Mars reigns at the even-numbered hours of the day, when demons have their play. The new moon was likewise regarded as an unfavorable season for bleeding, as were also the third of the month and the day preceding a festival (BT Shabbat 129b).

===Qualified acceptance; partial skepticism===
However, contrary stories are related. It is said that Abraham predicted in these astrological tablets that he would have no second son, but God said unto him, "Away with your astrology; for Israel there is no ''mazal'' ("luck", literally "planet" or "constellation")!" The birth of his second son, the patriarch Isaac, then gives lie to the idea that astrology is valid. (BT Shabbat 156a). Midrash Genesis Rabbah states that Abraham was not an astrologer, but rather a prophet, inasmuch as only those beneath the stars could be subject to their influence; but that Abraham was above them (Genesis Rabbah xliv. 12).

In general, many people quoted in the Talmud believed that in theory astrology had merit as some kind of science, but they were skeptical that astrological signs could be interpreted correctly or in a practical fashion. Commenting on astrologers in Sotah 12b, the Talmud says of them that "They gaze and know not at what they gaze at, they ponder and know not what they ponder."

The most popular form of astrological belief was the selection of propitious days. According to this idea, certain periods of time are regarded as lucky or unlucky. Rabbi Akiba contends ''against'' the belief that the year before the jubilee is exceptionally blessed. The belief is also condemned that no business should be begun on the new moon, on Friday, or on Sabbath evening (Sifre, Deut. 171; Sifra, Kedoshim, vi.; Sanh. 65).

==Hebrew calendar correlation to zodiac==
{{See also|Hebrew calendar|Hebrew astronomy#Chronology and the Mazzaroth}}
The Talmud identified the 12 constellations of the [[zodiac]] with the 12 months of the [[Hebrew calendar]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} The correspondence of the constellations with their names in Hebrew and the months is as follows:

# [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] - Ṭaleh - [[Nisan]]
# [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] - Shor - [[Iyar]]
# [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]] - Teomim - [[Sivan]]
# [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]] - Sarṭon - [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]]
# [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] - Ari - [[Av (month)|Av]]
# [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] - Betulah - [[Elul]]
# [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]] - Moznayim - [[Tishrei]]
# [[Scorpius|Scorpio]] - 'Aḳrab - [[Cheshvan]]
# [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] - Ḳasshat - [[Kislev]]
# [[Capricornus|Capricorn]] - Gedi - [[Tevet]]
# [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] - D'li - [[Shevat]]
# [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] - Dagim - [[Adar]]

Some scholars identified the 12 signs of the zodiac with the 12 sons of [[Jacob|Yakov]]/[[Jacob]]/[[Israelite|twelve tribes of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;(12 Signs, 12 Sons: Astrology in the Bible, David Womack, Harper &amp; Row, San Francisco 1978, pg 43)&lt;/ref&gt;

In should be noted that the 12 [[lunar months]] of the [[Hebrew Calendar]] are just that: based on the 12 lunar months of 29.53 days each and the [[lunar year]] of 354 days. To ensure that the holiday of Passover falls in the spring, a leap month is added 7 times in the 19-year calendar cycle. The calendar originally alternated between 29-day months and 30-day months based on witness testimony before the [[Sanhedrin]], and the leap month added when deemed necessary. Subsequently, with the end of the Sanhedrin, the [[Hebrew calendar|modern Hebrew calendar]] was adopted based on mathematical calculation.

For astrological purposes therefore, the months continue to match approximately with the assigned constellations (in contrast to a purely lunar calendar, which would shift association of the relevant Hebrew month with the dominant astrological Sun sign). The season aspect of the signs corresponds with the seasons in Israel. Thus, the water signs fall in the winter months which mark the rainy season. When a leap month is required, it is always the month of Adar (the traditional end of the rain season), thus perpetuating the influence of Pisces for one additional month.

==In the medieval era==
Many rabbis in the [[Geonim|Geonic]] era (after the close of the Talmud, early medieval period) discussed the varying [[Talmud]]ic and [[midrash]]ic views on astrology. One [[responsum]] takes a middle view: ''Otzar HaGeonim'' 113, concludes that astrology has some reality, in that the stars give a person certain inclinations; however each person has the ability to overcome their own inclinations, and thus maintains free will.

Astrology was practised by some Jews throughout the [[Middle Ages]], both as a professional art and as a science. Coming from the East, Jews were sometimes looked upon as heirs and successors of the [[Chaldea]]ns. For this reason Jews sometimes were regarded by the Occidental world as masters of Astrology. Their supposed power over destiny on occasion filled the multitudes with awe and fear ([[Jassuda Bédarride]], ''Les Juifs en France,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;49, 454, note 21; [[Jacques Basnage]], ''Histoire des Juifs'', iv. 1212; [[P. Cassel]], ''Juden'', in [[Ersch]] and [[Gruber]]'s "Encyc." pp.&amp;nbsp;16, 17; 52, note 78; 67, notes 50 and 51; 115, 171, 224).

[[Abraham ibn Ezra]] was a follower of astrology, which he calls "a sublime science." Besides translating another [[Jewish]] philosopher [[Mashallah ibn Athari|Mashallah]]'s astrological work ''Questions'' and another work of this author on the eclipse of the moon from the [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] into [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]], he wrote ''Nativity'', ''Sentences of the Constellations'', ''Reshit Hokhmah'' (''Beginning of Wisdom''), ''Book of the World'', a treatise on the ''Planets'', a treatise on the ''Luminaries'', and a [[horoscope]]. He often refers to astrology in his [[Meforshim|Bible commentaries]]. To him heaven with its constellations is "the book of life," in which man's destiny is written, and against which there is recourse to God as "the Almighty," who overrules all these influences. These remarks may be found in his commentary to [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]] 69:29, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 17:9, and to [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 6:3, 33:21. In the book ''Rabbi Abraham Ibn Ezra: Studies in the Writings of a Twelfth-Century Jewish Polymath'' (Harvard, 1993, {{ISBN|0-674-74554-X}}), the author of a chapter dealing with Ibn Ezra's astrological views ("Some Astrological Themes in the Thought of Abraham Ibn Ezra") states that: "The gist of the Jewish attitude toward astrology as formulated by Ibn Ezra has usually been understood—in general, correctly—as follows. The deity has delegated to the stars the governance of the sublunar world. Israel [Jews], however, enjoys a special status, which is manifest most decisively in its possession of the Torah. As long as a Jew is engaged in the study and observance of the Torah, he is linked to a spiritual realm which is itself superior to the stars. In this way a Jew may liberate himself from the decrees of the stars" (p.&amp;nbsp;49).

[[Dunash ibn Tamim]] (850-956 CE, North Africa), who wrote a commentary on the Kabbalistic work ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'', wrote a treatise on astronomy which rejected astrology.

Rabbi [[Abraham ben David of Posquières]], in his critical notes to Maimonides' ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', ''Teshuvah'', 5:5, asserts the influence of the stars upon destiny, while also contending that by faith in God man may overcome this influence.

[[Gersonides]] believed that astrology was real, and developed a naturalistic, non-supernatural explanation of how it works. In ''Philosophies of Judaism'', [[Julius Guttmann]] explains that for Gersonides, astrology was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;founded on the metaphysical doctrine of the dependence of all earthly occurrences upon the heavenly world. The general connection imparted to the prophet by the active intellect is the general order of the astrological constellation. The constellation under which a man is born determines his nature and fate, and constellations as well determine the life span of nations....The active intellect knows the astrological order, from the most general form of the constellations to their last specification, which in turn contains all of the conditions of occurrence of a particular event. Thus, when a prophet deals with the destiny of a particular person or human group, he receives from the active intellect a knowledge of the order of the constellations, and with sufficient precision to enable him to predict its fate in full detail.....
This astrological determinism has only one limitation. The free will of man could shatter the course of action ordained for him by the stars; prophecy could therefore predict the future on the basis of astrological determination only insofar as the free will of man does not break through the determined course of things.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gersonides believed astrology to be a science that predicts events according to set laws of nature (albeit, a different set than the ones we are used to.) He also believed that a person who has perfected his thinking could interact with the laws of nature through the active intellect. Gersonides thus thought of himself as creating a rationalist and non-supernatural theology. In this sense, there is a similarity between Gersonides and Maimonides.

[[Nahmanides]] wrote a responsum stating that while one may not ask an astrologer for a prediction, astrology itself is real. He states rules that one must ultimately trust in God, and not in any lesser force. As such, he concludes that one is forbidden to ask an astrologer for a prediction, but one may act on the words of an astrologer if advice is freely given. Ultimately he holds that while the stars give a person certain inclinations, people have the ability to overcome their own inclinations, and thus maintains free will. &lt;!--source?--&gt;

[[Maimonides]] answered an inquiry concerning astrology, addressed to him from Marseilles. He responded that man should believe only what can be supported either by rational proof, by the evidence of the senses, or by trustworthy authority. He affirms that he has studied astrology and that it does not deserve to be described as a science. The supposition that the fate of a man could be dependent upon the constellations is ridiculed by him; he argues that such a theory would rob life of purpose and would make man a slave of destiny. &lt;!--source--&gt;

[[Isaac ben Joseph ibn Pulgar]] (14th century, Spain) was a Jewish philosopher who wrote ''Ezer ha-Dat'' ("Support of Faith"), and wrote against the validity of astrology.

In the ''[[Arba'ah Turim|Tur]]'', an early code of [[halakha|Jewish law]], the author brings forth the views of Nahmanides and Maimonides, and concurs with Nahmanides (''Yoreh Deah'' 179). A later code of Jewish law, the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' avoids contention by stressing the common point: One may not consult an astrologer; the act is forbidden. Whether or not its author, [[Yosef Karo]], thought that astrology might have some basis in fact is not mentioned in this work (''Yoreh Deah'' 179:1).

==Moshe Chaim Luzzatto==
In ''[[Derekh Hashem]]'' Section II, chapter 7, [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] discusses the influence of stars on humanity and events on earth. There he gives two reasons for the existence of stars and planets. The first is that stars and planets maintain the existence of all physical things on earth, acting as the means by which spiritual forces are transmitted to physical entities. The second is that events on earth are also initiated through planetary and stellar activity. Luzzatto states that each earthly phenomenon is assigned to a specific star, which controls it. Quoting the [[Talmud]]ic dictum in ''[[Nezikin|Sanhedrin]]'' 156a – "for Israel, there is no ''mazal'' ("luck", literally "planet" or "constellation")", he also states that higher powers (i.e. [[God]] or [[angel]]s) may overcome the influences of this system, and that they typically do so for [[Jew]]s.

Luzzatto notes that the laws and rules governing this system of astrological influence are extremely complex, and not easily ascertainable through direct observation; thus astrologers are rarely able to predict the future accurately or clearly. The accuracy of their predictions is further reduced by the aforementioned propensity of [[Divine providence]] to intervene and override the system. This, Luzzatto states, explains the use of the word ''me'asher'' ("something") in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah 47:13]] ("Now let the astrologers, stargazers and fortunetellers stand up and tell you something about what will come upon you"); in Luzzatto's view, this means they can tell you ''something'' about the future, but not everything.

==Views in the modern era==
Strictures against astrology appear in the official Torah commentary of [[Conservative Judaism]] and on the official website of [[Reform Judaism]], and a number of Conservative and Reform [[rabbi]]s have written against the practice. Meanwhile, the traditionalist stance of Orthodoxy and Modern Orthodoxy maintain the guideline established in Karo's [[Shulchan Aruch]].

Commenting on Deuteronomy 18:9-12, ''[[Etz Hayim]]'', the official Torah commentary of Conservative Judaism writes "Hence the use of astrology is prohibited (BT Pesachim 113b)." Similarly, [[Simchah Roth]], a Conservative rabbi comments negatively on astrology in his "Halakhah Study Group" session. (Halakhah Study Group, Nov. 18 2003, Bet Midrash Virtuali)

Conservative Rabbi Aaron Kriegel writes:
{{quote|"However, astrology is by and large nothing more than magic. The Torah is very clear that we are to steer clear of magicians and practitioners of "witchcraft." I'm not talking about the David Copperfield type of entertainment; I'm referring to those who believe that their predictions or tricks can have a real influence on the world, and by implication, can force God to give them what they want. The idea that if only we could say the right words or take the right actions, God will give us anything we want is nearly idolatrous. It turns God into nothing more than a tool for us to use when we want something, rather than the majestic creator of the world."}}

On the [[Union for Reform Judaism]] website Jeffrey K. Salkin derides astrology as "a new-age trap":
{{quote|"If you visit a Barnes and Noble superstore, you will see what much of American religion has become. There are three bookcases for Judaism; three bookcases for general religion and Christianity; three for general inspiration; two each for Bible, eastern philosophy, and myth; and nine bookcases for New Age. The New Age menu is diverse, including spiritualism, astrology, and psychic phenomena; alchemy, tarot, goddess worship, and Wicca (witchcraft); out-of-body experiences, near-death experiences, and reincarnation: angels, Satanism, and the occult..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://urj.org/worship/letuslearn/s16howtobe/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107131543/http://urj.org/worship/letuslearn/s16howtobe/ |archivedate=2009-01-07 |df= }} Union for Reform Judaism: Jeffrey K. Salkin, ''How To Be A Truly Spiritual Jew And Avoid The Pitfalls Of Quick-Fix Religious Consumerism''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] rabbis have written against the practice as well, some seeing it as forbidden by [[halakha|Jewish law]]. For instance, 
Modern Orthodox Rabbi Ephraim Buchwald writes:
{{quote|"The Torah tells us in Deuteronomy 18:9, that when the Jewish people enter the land of Israel, they must not follow the abominable practices of the nations that reside there. It is strictly prohibited to cause a son or a daughter to pass through the fire, to practice divination, astrology, or to visit one who reads omens....to follow these practices is an abomination in G-d's eyes.

It is quite extraordinary that Maimonides...virtually alone in the Middle Ages, rejected belief in astrology. In a letter to the rabbis of Southern France he distinguishes between astronomy as a true science and astrology which he deems to be sheer superstition. Many hundreds of years passed until the Western world came to the same conclusion. Maimonides boldly declares that in Judaism a person's fate is determined by G-d alone, not by the stars."&lt;ref&gt;(Torah commentary, National Jewish Outreach Program, Parashat Shoftim 5763-2003)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom (Orthodox) [[Jonathan Sacks]], writes:{{quote|"Wrestling with men: since the days of Abraham, to be a Jew is to be an iconoclast. We challenge the idols of the age, whatever the idols, whatever the age. Sometimes it meant wrestling with idolatry, superstition, paganism, magic, astrology, primitive beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;''Covenant and Conversation: Thoughts on the Weekly Parsha'', Vayyishlach 5755, Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contrast, Modern Orthodox Rabbi Nachum Amsel writes:
{{quote|"It seems that most of the authorities believe that astrology has some sort of power, but there is a fine line between believing in this and believing in power other than God, which is not the Jewish view. Thus, one cannot give credence to any power except God nor use astrology on a regular basis to guide one's life.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}}}

"The Significance of Astrology in Judaism" is an article along these lines from the Orthodox Union. This article concisely puts this issue into perspective.
{{quote|
"In Judaism, Astrology is not regarded as "idol worship," even though the generic name for "idol worship" is "Avodat Kochavim U'Mazalot," Worship of the Stars and the Signs of the Zodiac."
From the Jewish perspective, the stars are not unrelated to events on earth. It is not irrelevant whether one was born on Pesach, or Yom Kippur, or Lag Ba'Omer or on any particular day. Each day is special and has a unique imprint.
On the other hand, if an individual was born under the "sign" of Mars, the Talmud says that he will have a tendency to spill blood. This tendency can be realized in a number of very different ways, however, which are subject to an individual's choice. In this case, options might be a soldier, a surgeon, a murderer, a "shochet," a ritual slaughterer of animals, or a "mohel," one who performs ritual circumcisions. These options correspond to a potential hero, a healer, one who violates the "image of G-d," to those who do "holy work" of different types.
There is a principle, "Ayn Mazal L'Yisrael," "Israel's fate is not determined by the stars." The Jew, raised in his People's traditions and Torah values, feels the reality of "freedom of choice" in his bones. So deeply ingrained is this knowledge and feeling, that the Jew rarely has cause to think about astrological factors.
It is the belief that one cannot escape from the grip of the stars that distinguishes Astrology from "Worship of the Stars and Signs of the Zodiac." It is always possible to define one's fate, by choosing behavior which is guided by morality and integrity, within the parameters – intellectual and emotional, physical and spiritual, which a person is given to work with."}}

[[Aryeh Kaplan]], known for his rationalist synthesis of modern scientific thinking and Kabbalah, and creator of a modern translation of ''[[Derekh Hashem]]'', echoes the viewpoint of its author ([[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]]) on astrology. In his translation of and commentary on ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'', Kaplan writes:
{{quote|"In order to understand the significance of the astrological forces, we must first understand the role of angels in the chain between the Sefirot and the physical world. The Sefirot are in the universe of Atzilut, and below this is Beriyah, the universe of the Throne, which serves to allow the Sefirot to interact with the lower worlds. Between Beriyah and Asiyah is Yetzirah, the world of the angels. ....every one of God's words is actually an angel. When we speak of "God's word," we are actually speaking of His interaction with the lower worlds. The force that transverses the spiritual domain is what we call an angel.

The stars also form an important link in God's providence over the physical world. Between God and man, there are many levels of interaction, the lowest being those of the angels and the stars, The Midrash thus teaches, "There is no blade of grass that does not have a constellation (''Mazal'') over it, telling it to grow." As the commentators explain it, God's providence works through the angels, but these angels, in turn, work through the stars and planets."}}

However, Kaplan also writes,
{{quote|"Faith and trust in God are partners, since one who believes in an omniscient, omnipotent and benevolent God must also believe that He will provide for His faithful. Therefore, one should trust in God and not be overly concerned about the future....Therefore, one should not seek to ascertain the future by fortune telling, astrology or other superstitions. Concerning this, The Torah commands us, "You must remain totally faithful to God your Lord" (Deut. 18:13), which some authorities count as a positive commandment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aish.com/literacy/concepts/Belief_in_God_.asp Belief in God, by Aryeh Kaplan] ''The Handbook of Jewish Thought''. Vol. 2, Maznaim Publishing. 1992&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Kabbalistic astrology==
Kabbalistic astrology, also called ''mazal'' or ''[[Mazzaroth|mazalot]]'', ("[[zodiac]]," "[[destiny]]") is a system of [[astrology]] based upon the [[kabbalah]]. It is used to interpret and delineate a person's [[Natal chart|birth chart]], seeking to understand it through a kabbalistic lens.

Most [[astrologer]]s cast and use [[horoscope]]s to depict planetary placements which are believed to influence daily activities. Kabbalistic astrologers tend to take a slightly different approach because they wish to observe the [[planet]]s as they relate to each ''[[Sephirot|sephira]]'' in the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]].

Each ''sephira'' points to a specific character trait. Each ''sephira'' in the trestleboard corresponds with a specific planet and is therefore closely aligned with the celestial art of astrology.

===Planetary correspondences===

Each of the ten ''sephirot'' corresponds to an astrological feature.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} These astrological correspondences exist in the world of [[Assiah]], the lowest of the [[Four Worlds]] of kabbalah.

===Mystical connection of Scriptures and Menorah to the 7 Classical Planets and Lunar Phases===
The ancient Hebrews were well aware of the Sun, Moon, and [[classical planet|five planets]] seen with the naked eye and [[Hebrew mysticism]] recognized their great importance. Therefore, along with the 4 [[lunar phases]] being slightly over 7 days (~7.4 days) each, the number 7 was held in very high regard. The [[Torah]] reflects this with ''Bereshis 1:1'' ([[Book of Genesis]] ''1:1'') being 7 words and 28 letters (7x4) in its original Hebrew. This is known as ''God's signature''.

''Genesis 1:14, "And God said, 'Let there be lights in the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons, days, years and festivals'...the 4th day (of 7)."'' The #7 is the great recurring numerical theme of the Hebrew (and Christian) scriptures. The [[menorah (Temple)|menorah]]'s 7 lamps on 4 branches correspond to the lights of the 7 Classical planets: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun (4th), Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.

'''John Howard Pyle''' (March 25, 1906 – November 29, 1987) was the [[List of Governors of Arizona|ninth governor]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Arizona]], serving from 1951 to 1955. He was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. A 1930 graduate of [[Arizona State University]], he also was a member of [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity.

==Biography==
Born in 1906 in [[Sheridan, Wyoming]], Pyle was the first governor of Arizona to be born in the 20th century and was the Program Director of KFAD (now [[KTAR (AM)|KTAR]]) Radio in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] from 1930 to 1951. He also served as a war correspondent during [[World War II]] and covered the surrender ceremony of the Japanese. Pyle defeated pioneering female politician [[Ana Frohmiller]] in his 1950 campaign for governor. He served as [[Governor of Arizona]] from 1951 to 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/putney-pyscher.html| title= Pyle, John Howard (1906-1987) |publisher= The Political Graveyard |accessdate= November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, he attempted to break up a polygamous [[fundamentalist Mormon]] compound in [[Colorado City, Arizona]], in what became known as the ''[[Short Creek raid|Short Creek Raid]]'', which resulted in two dozen men arrested and 236 children placed in foster homes. This move alienated many voters in the state after photographs of tearful children being forcibly removed from their distraught mothers appeared in the newspapers. Later citing the negative reaction by the voters to the Short Creek raid as the cause, Pyle subsequently lost his 1954 re-election bid for a third term to his Democratic opponent, former Senate Majority Leader [[Ernest McFarland]] and left office in January 1955.

After his governorship ended Pyle joined the Eisenhower administration as Deputy Assistant to the President, working primarily as a policy liaison responsible for the Joint Federal-State Action Committee promoting stronger, more responsible local government. He resigned in 1959 to accept an appointment as president of the [[National Safety Council]].  Pyle retired in 1953 and returned to his home in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], where he became active in community affairs and authored a popular newspaper column.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D71F31F932A35751C1A961948260 Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

He received honorary LL.D. degrees from [[University of Redlands]], [[Chapman University]], [[Arizona State University]], [[Lebanon College]] and [[Bradley University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_arizona/col2-content/main-content-list/title_pyle_john.html|title= Arizona Governor John Howard Pyle|publisher= National Governors Association |accessdate= November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Jupiter Column''' ({{lang-de|Jupitergigantensäule}} or {{lang|de|Jupitersäule}}) is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] monument belonging to a type widespread in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Germania]]. Such pillars express the religious beliefs of their time. They were erected in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, mostly near Roman settlements or [[Roman villa|villas]] in the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] provinces. Some examples also occur in [[Gallia|Gaul]] and [[Roman Britain|Britain]].

The base of the monuments was normally formed by a ''Viergötterstein'' (four gods stone), in itself a common monument type, usually depicting [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Minerva]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Hercules]]. This would support a ''Wochengötterstein'' (a carving depicting the personifications of the seven days of the week), which, in turn, supported a column or pillar, normally decorated with a scale pattern. The column was crowned with a statue of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], usually on horseback, trampling a [[Gigantes|Giant]] (usually depicted as a snake). In some cases (e.g. at [[Walheim]]), the column capital is decorated with four heads, usually interpreted as depictions of the four times of day (morning, midday, evening, night). The total height of a Jupiter Column is normally around 4&amp;nbsp;m, but some examples are taller, e.g. a famous example at [[Mainz]] with a height of more than 9&amp;nbsp;m.

The columns in [[Germania Superior|Upper Germany]] normally depict Jupiter defeating a Giant, as described above, and are thus known as ''Jupitergigantensäulen'' ("Jupiter-Giant-Columns"). In [[Germania Inferior|Lower Germany]], Jupiter is normally depicted enthroned without the Giant; those monuments are commonly described simply as ''Jupitersäulen'' ("Jupiter Columns").

The pillars were often placed within a walled enclosure and accompanied by an altar.

No such monument has survived intact. They are known from [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] finds or from secondary use as [[spolia]], e.g. in Christian churches. Recently, reconstructions of some Jupiter Columns have been erected at or near where they were found, e.g. in [[Ladenburg]], [[Obernburg]], [[Benningen am Neckar]], [[Sinsheim]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Mainz]] and near the [[Saalburg]].

According to the historian [[Greg Woolf]], the pillars depict the victory of [[Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] over the forces of [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]], the god himself being raised high above the other gods and humankind, but closely linked with them. Woolf sees most such monuments as dedications by individuals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3105">'''Kikayon''' (קִיקָיוֹן) is the [[Hebrew]] name of a plant mentioned in the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Book of Jonah]].

==Origins==
The first use of the term ''kikayon'' is in the biblical book of ''Jonah'', Chapter 4. In the quote below, from the Jewish Publication Society translation of 1917, the English word 'gourd' occurs where the Hebrew has ''kikayon.''

&lt;blockquote&gt;
6 And the LORD God prepared a [[gourd]], and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his evil. So Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd. 7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered. 8 And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said: ‘It is better for me to die than to live.’ 9 And God said to Jonah: ‘Art thou greatly angry for the gourd?’ And he said: ‘I am greatly angry, even unto death.’ 10 And the LORD said: ‘Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow, which came up in a night, and perished in a night; 11 and should not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle?’

--Jonah 4:6-11&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Classification==

The word ''kikayon'' is only referenced in the book of Jonah and there is some question as to what kind of plant it is.  Some hypotheses include a [[gourd]] and a [[castor oil plant]].
The current Hebrew usage of the word refers to the [[castor oil plant]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Ricinusstrauch.jpg|thumb|Young [[Castor oil plant|castor oil or ''Ricinus'' plant]]]]

A well-known argument between [[Jerome]] and [[Augustine]] concerned whether to translate ''kikayon'' as "gourd" or "ivy", although Jerome indicates that in fact the plant is neither:

:I have already given a sufficient answer to this in my commentary on Jonah. At present, I deem it enough to say that in that passage, where the Septuagint has gourd, and Aquila and the others have rendered the word ivy (κίσσος), the Hebrew manuscript has ciceion, which is in the Syriac tongue, as now spoken, ciceia. It is a kind of shrub having large leaves like a vine, and when planted it quickly springs up to the size of a small tree, standing upright by its own stem, without requiring any support of canes or poles, as both gourds and ivy do. If, therefore, in translating word for word, I had put the word ciceia, no one would know what it meant; if I had used the word gourd, I would have said what is not found in the Hebrew. I therefore put down ivy, that I might not differ from all other translators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102075.htm Letter from Jerome to Augustine], dated 404, reproduced at newadvent.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kirat Karō''' is one of the [[Three pillars of Sikhism]], the others being [[Naam Japo]] and [[Vaṇḍ chakkō]]. The term means to earn an honest, pure and dedicated living by exercising one's God-given skills, abilities, talents and hard labour for the benefit and improvement of the individual, their family and society at large. This means to work with determination and focus by the sweat of one's brow and not to be lazy and to waste one's life to time. Meanwhile, ''[[Simran (Sanskrit word)|Simran]]'' and dedication to the work of God, not personal gain, should be one's main motivation.

There are some jobs which aren't allowed in Sikhism, such as a worker in brothels, prostitute, fortune-teller, astrologer, worker in taverns and pubs, worker in places were gambling is dealt, and many more. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], [[Guru Nanak Dev ji]] says: "Those who have meditated on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and departed after having worked by the sweat of their brows
-O Nanak, their faces are radiant in the Court of the Lord, and many are saved along with them!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9540">[[File:Kenmare Holy Cross Church, Ireland.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Holy Cross Church, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kerry|Diocese of Kerry]]]]
This is a comprehensive list of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[diocese]]s in [[Ireland|the island of Ireland]]. [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland]] comprises only a [[Latin rite]] hierarchy, encompassing both the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], having been unaffected by the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1920–22. There are no Eastern Catholic jurisdictions, nor other exempt Ordinariates.

There are in total 26 dioceses in Ireland, each led by a diocesan [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] (including four Metropolitan Archdioceses, one per ancient province), joined in a binational Irish [[Episcopal Conference]], based in the primas Armagh. 
* The Holy See is represented by the [[Apostolic Nuncio to Ireland]] I the Republic and Northern Ireland (while a different Apostolic Nunciature, in London, represents it in Great Britain, the Albion-based UK parts England, wales and Scotland)

==Structural changes over the years==
The diocesan system of Christian church government in Ireland was set up by the [[Synod of Rathbreasail]] in 1111 and modified by the [[Synod of Kells]] in 1152, replacing the earlier [[Celtic Christian]] monastic model. The island of Ireland is divided into four [[ecclesiastical province]]s each headed by a metropolitan [[archbishop]]. The provinces were almost co-extensive with their contemporary [[Provinces of Ireland|civil counterparts]]. After the 
[[Reformation in Ireland]], both the Protestant [[Church of Ireland]] and the Roman Catholic Church saw themselves as successors to the pre-Reformation church. Most bishops were non-resident during the enforcement of the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], but the dioceses continued to exist. Whereas [[Roman Catholicism in England and Wales|English Catholic]] dioceses were forbidden by law from having the same name as a diocese of the established [[Church of England]], no such prohibition was made for Irish dioceses. 

The Roman Catholic dioceses remained close to the original, with a few notable differences.  Firstly, several dioceses with small populations were merged, and now have more than one name to represent their merger. Secondly, the Diocese of Galway was created in 1831 following the abolition of the [[Wardenship of Galway]].  

Dr. James Butler 2nd, the Archbishop of Cashel and Emly (1774–91),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03401a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; on being appointed by Rome moved his residence and [[cathedra]] from Cashel, favouring [[Thurles]] instead, where his successors continue to reign today. Similarly, in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Elphin|Diocese of Elphin]], the [[Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (Sligo)|Cathedral]], which was originally established in the County Roscommon town of [[Elphin, County Roscommon|Elphin]], is now in [[Sligo]].

Another change is that the ancient see of Kilfenora has been administered by the Bishop of Galway in the province of Tuam since the late 19th Century. The correct title of the Bishop is now the Bishop of Galway and Kilmacduagh and [[Apostolic Administrator]] of Kilfenora. More recently, the Diocese of Ross merged with the Diocese of Cork to form the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cork and Ross|Diocese of Cork and Ross]] in the 1950s.

== Geographic boundaries ==
Unlike many (European) countries, the boundaries of the Roman Catholic dioceses in Ireland do not conform with the political border between the Republic of Ireland (independent) and Northern Ireland (part of the UK). One archdiocese and three dioceses straddle the international border; two dioceses are wholly in Northern Ireland.

* Metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archdiocese of Armagh]] (includes parts of counties [[County Armagh|Armagh]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]])
*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Clogher|Diocese of Clogher]] (includes parts of counties [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and Tyrone)
*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Derry|Diocese of Derry]] (includes parts of counties Londonderry, [[County Antrim|Antrim]] and Tyrone)
*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kilmore|Diocese of Kilmore]] (includes parts of County Fermanagh)
*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Down and Connor|Diocese of Down and Connor]] (in Northern Ireland)
*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dromore|Diocese of Dromore]] (in Northern Ireland)

== Current dioceses ==

**[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kildare and Leighlin|Diocese of Kildare and Leighlin]]
**[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ossory|Diocese of Ossory]]

**[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Kilfenora|Diocese of Galway and Kilmacduagh and Kilfenora]] 
**[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Killala|Diocese of Killala]]

As the Diocese of Kilfenora is in the Ecclesiastical province of Cashel, the Bishop of Galway and Kilmacduagh is its apostolic administrator rather than bishop.

== Former dioceses ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="105978">A [[new religious movement]] (NRM) is a [[religious]], ethical, or spiritual group or community with practices of relatively modern origins. NRMs may be novel in origin or they may exist on the fringes of a wider religion, in which case they will be distinct from pre-existing [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s. Academics identify a variety of characteristics which they employ in categorizing groups as new religious movements. The term is broad and inclusive, rather than sharply defined. New religious movements are generally seen as syncretic, employing human and material assets to disseminate their ideas and worldviews, deviating in some degree from a society's traditional forms or doctrines, focused especially upon the self, and having a peripheral relationship that exists in a state of tension with established societal conventions.&lt;ref name="beckford1987"/&gt;{{rp|29}}&lt;ref name="nelson1987"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Geoffrey K.|title=Cults, new religions and religious creativity|date=3 December 1987|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=978-0-7102-0855-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|107}}&lt;ref name="swenson2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swenson|first1=Donald S.|title=Society, spirituality, and the sacred : a social scientific introduction|date=15 August 2009|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-8020-9680-7|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|206}}

An NRM may be one of a wide range of movements ranging from those with loose affiliations based on novel approaches to [[spirituality]] or [[religion]] to [[communitarian]] enterprises that demand a considerable amount of group conformity and a social identity that [[separatism|separates]] their adherents from [[mainstream]] society. Use of the term NRM is not universally accepted among the groups to which it is applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coney|first1=Judith|title=A Response to: Religious Liberty in Western Europe by Massimo Introvigne, Vol. 5, No. 2|journal=[[ISKCON]] Communications Journal|date=June 1998|volume=6|issue=1|publisher=International Society for Krishna Consciousness}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars have estimated that NRMs now number in the tens of thousands worldwide, with most in Asia and Africa.  Most have only a few members, some have thousands, and very few have more than a million.&lt;ref name="cresswell1999"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Wilson|editor1-first=Bryan R.|editor2-last=Cresswell|editor2-first=Jamie|title=New religious movements : challenge and response|date=5 May 1999|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-415-20049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}} Academics occasionally propose amendments to technical definitions and continue to add new groups.&lt;ref name="beckford1987"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Beckford|editor1-first=James A.|editor1-link=James A.

*[[#Kemp2007|Ramstedt 2007]], p. 6. "How can one find a definition of 'New Age' that will serve to bring so many different features together? One major difficulty in defining 'New Age' is that different writers draw different boundaries. Paul Heelas, for example, includes a significant number of what he calls the 'self religions': groups like Landmark Forum (also known simply as The Forum, formerly est or Erhard Seminar Training) and Programmes Limited (formerly Exegesis). Some writers trace the New Age back to William Blake (1757–1827); others see it as originating in the 'hippie' counter-culture in the USA in the 1960s, while the scholar of the New Age, Wouter Hanegraaff, places it later still, regarding it as beginning in the second half of the 1970s."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morgan Scott Peck''' (May 22, 1936 – September 25, 2005) was an American [[psychiatrist]] and best-selling author who wrote the book [[#The_Road_Less_Traveled|''The Road Less Traveled'']], published in 1978.

==Early life==
Peck was born in [[New York City]], the son of Zabeth (née Saville) and David Warner Peck, an attorney and judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/24/obituaries/david-w-peck-87-former-justice-and-court-reformer-in-new-york.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | first=Joan | last=Cook | title=David W.

Scott Peck's journey with Parkinson's disease | publisher=[[National Catholic Reporter]] | work=Health Beat | date=November 7, 2003 | accessdate=January 2, 2013 | author=Jones, Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His parents sent him to the prestigious boarding school [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] in [[Exeter, New Hampshire]], when he was 13.&lt;ref name="Jonesmult" /&gt; In his book, ''The Road Less Traveled'',&lt;ref name="Roadmult" /&gt; he confides the story of his brief stay at Exeter, and admits that it was a most miserable time. Finally, at age 15, during the spring holiday of his third year, he came home and refused to return to the school, whereupon his parents sought psychiatric help for him and he was (much to his amusement in later life) diagnosed with depression and recommended for a month's stay in a psychiatric hospital (unless he chose to return to school). He then transferred to  [[Friends Seminary]] (a private K-12 school) in late 1952, and graduated in 1954, after which he received a BA from [[Harvard]] in 1958, and an MD degree from [[Case Western Reserve University]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="Jonesmult"&gt;Jones, Arthur. (2007). ''The Road He Traveled: The Revealing Biography of M. Scott Peck''. Rider.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Peck served in administrative posts in the government during his career as a psychiatrist. He also served in the [[U.S. Army]] and rose to the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]]. His Army assignments included stints as chief of psychology at the Army Medical Center in [[Okinawa]], Japan, and assistant chief of psychiatry and neurology in the office of the [[Surgeon General of the United States|surgeon general]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Jonesmult" /&gt; He was the Medical Director of the [[New Milford Hospital]] Mental Health Clinic and a psychiatrist in private practice in [[New Milford (town), Connecticut|New Milford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="Jonesmult" /&gt; His first and best-known book, ''The Road Less Traveled'', sold more than ten million copies.

Peck's works combined his experiences from his private psychiatric practice with a distinctly religious point of view. In his second book, ''[[People of the Lie]]'', he wrote, "After many years of vague identification with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Islam]]ic mysticism, I ultimately made a firm Christian commitment – signified by my [[non-denominational]] baptism on the ninth of March 1980..." (Peck, 1983/1988,&lt;ref name="Liemult" /&gt; p11). One of his views was that people who are evil attack others rather than face their own failures.&lt;ref name="Roadmult" /&gt;

In December 1984, Peck co-founded the Foundation for Community Encouragement (FCE), a tax-exempt, nonprofit, public educational foundation, whose stated mission is "to teach the principles of community to individuals and organizations." FCE ceased day-to-day operations from 2002 to 2009. In late 2009, almost 25 years after FCE was first founded, the organization resumed functioning, and began offering community building and training events in 2010.&lt;ref name="Jonesmult" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Peck married Lily Ho in 1959, and they had three children. In 1994, they jointly received the [[Community of Christ International Peace Award]]. In 2004, they were separated and later divorced. Peck then married Kathleen Kline Yates.&lt;ref name="Jonesmult" /&gt;

While Peck's writings emphasized the virtues of a disciplined life and [[delayed gratification]], his personal life was far more turbulent.&lt;ref name="Jonesmult" /&gt; For example, in his book ''In Search of Stones'',&lt;ref name="Searchstonesmult"&gt;Peck, M. Scott. (1996). ''In Search of Stones: A Pilgrimage of Faith, Reason and Discovery ''. Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; Peck acknowledged having [[extramarital affairs]] and being estranged from two of his children.

==Death==
Peck died at his home in [[Connecticut]] on September 25, 2005, after suffering from [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[Pancreatic cancer|pancreatic]]&lt;ref name="Jonesmult" /&gt; and [[liver duct cancer]]. [[Fuller Theological Seminary]] houses the archives of his publications, awards, and correspondence.

==''The Road Less Traveled''==

''The Road Less Traveled'',&lt;ref name="Roadmult" /&gt; published in 1978, is Peck's best-known work, and the one that made his reputation. It is, in short, a description of the attributes that make for a fulfilled human being, based largely on his experiences as a [[psychiatrist]] and a person.

The book consists of four parts.  In the first part Peck examines the notion of [[discipline]], which he considers essential for [[emotional]], [[spirituality|spiritual]], and [[Psyche (psychology)|psychological health]], and which he describes as "the means of spiritual evolution".  The elements of discipline that make for such health include the ability to delay [[gratification]], accepting [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] for oneself and one's actions, a dedication to [[truth]], and "balancing".  "Balancing" refers to the problem of reconciling multiple, complex, possibly conflicting factors that impact on an important decision—on one's own behalf or on behalf of another.

In the second part, Peck addresses the nature of love, which he considers the driving force behind spiritual growth.  He contrasts his own views on the nature of love against a number of common misconceptions about love, including:
* that love is identified with [[Romance (love)|romantic]] love (he considers it a very destructive myth when it is solely relying on "feeling in love"), 
* that love is related to [[behavioral addiction|dependency]], 
* that true love is linked with the feeling of "falling in love".
Peck argues that "true" love is rather an ''action'' that one undertakes ''consciously'' in order to extend one's ego boundaries by including others or humanity, and is therefore the spiritual nurturing—which can be directed toward oneself, as well as toward one's beloved.

In the third part Peck deals with [[religion]], and the commonly accepted views and misconceptions concerning religion.  He recounts experiences from several patient case histories, and the evolution of the patients' notion of God, religion, [[atheism]]—especially of their own "religiosity" or atheism—as their therapy with Peck progressed.

The fourth and final part concerns "[[divine grace|grace]]", the powerful force originating outside human consciousness that nurtures spiritual growth in human beings.  In order to focus on the topic, he describes the miracles of health, the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]], and [[serendipity]]—phenomena which Peck says:
*nurture human life and spiritual growth,
*are incompletely understood by [[scientific thinking]],
*are commonplace among humanity,
*originate outside the conscious human will.

He concludes that "the miracles described indicate that our growth as human beings is being assisted by a force other than our conscious will" (Peck, 1978/1992,&lt;ref name="Roadmult" /&gt; p281).

[[Random House]], where the then little-known psychiatrist first tried to publish his original manuscript, turned him down, saying the final section was "too Christ-y." Thereafter, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] published the work for $7,500 and printed a modest hardback run of 5,000 copies. The book took off only after Peck hit the lecture circuit and personally sought reviews in key publications. Later reprinted in paperback in 1980, ''The Road'' first made best-seller lists in 1984 – six years after its initial publication.&lt;ref name="Jonesmult" /&gt;

==Theories==

===Discipline===

In ''The Road Less Traveled'',&lt;ref name="Roadmult" /&gt; Peck wrote of the importance of discipline. He described four aspects of discipline:

* '''Delaying gratification''': Sacrificing present comfort for future gains.
* '''Acceptance of responsibility''': Accepting responsibility for one's own decisions.
* '''Dedication to truth''': Honesty, both in word and deed.
* '''Balancing''': Handling conflicting requirements. Scott Peck writes of an important skill to prioritize between different requirements – '''bracketing'''.

Peck’s book begins with the statement "Life is difficult" (Peck, 1978/1992,&lt;ref name="Roadmult" /&gt; p13). Peck argues that life was never meant to be easy, and is essentially a series of problems which can either be solved or ignored.

Peck defines discipline as the basic set of tools required to solve life’s problems. He considers these tools to include delaying gratification, assuming responsibility, dedication to the truth, and balancing. Peck argues that these are techniques of suffering, that enable the pain of problems to be worked through and systematically solved, producing growth. He argues that most people avoid the pain of dealing with their problems and suggests that it is through facing the pain of problem solving that life becomes more meaningful.

Delaying gratification is the process by which pain is chosen to be experienced before pleasure. Most learn this activity by the age of five. For example, a six-year-old child will prefer eating the cake first and the frosting last. Children will rather finish their homework first, so that they can play later on. However, a sizable number of adolescents seem to lack this capacity. These problematic students are totally controlled by their [[impulse (psychology)|impulse]]s. Such youngsters indulge in drugs, get into frequent [[fight]]s, and often find themselves in confrontation with [[authority]].

Peck states that it is only through taking responsibility and accepting the fact that life has problems, that these problems can then be solved. He argues that [[neurosis]] and character-disorder people represent two opposite disorders of responsibility. Neurotics assume too much responsibility and feel responsible for everything that goes wrong in their life, while character-disordered people deny responsibility, blaming others for their problems. Peck writes in the Road Less Traveled that "It is said ‘neurotics make themselves miserable; those with character disorders make everyone else miserable’" (Peck, 1978/1992,&lt;ref name="Roadmult" /&gt; p38). Peck argues that everyone is neurotic or character-disordered at some time in their life, and the balance is to avoid both extremes.

Dedication to the truth represents the capacity of an individual to modify and update their [[worldview]] when exposed to new information discordant with the old view. For example, a bitter childhood can leave a person with the false idea that the world is a hostile and inhuman place. However, with continued exposure to more positive aspects of the world, this existing worldview is challenged and needs to be modified to integrate the new experiences. Peck also argues that dedication to truth implies a life of genuine self-examination, a willingness to be personally challenged by others, and honesty to oneself and others.

Peck considers the use of these interrelated techniques of discipline as paramount, if the difficulties and conflicting requirements of life are to be dealt with and balanced successfully.

===Neurotic and legitimate suffering===

Peck believes that it is only through [[suffering]] and agonizing using the four aspects of discipline (delaying gratification, acceptance of responsibility, dedication to truth, and balancing) that we can resolve the many puzzles and conflicts that we face.&lt;ref name="Roadmult" /&gt; This is what he calls undertaking ''legitimate suffering''. Peck argues that by trying to avoid legitimate suffering, people actually ultimately end up suffering more. This extra unnecessary suffering is what Scott Peck terms ''neurotic suffering''. He references [[Carl Jung]] 'Neurosis is always a substitute for legitimate suffering'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G ''Collected Works of C.G Jung''. Princeton University Press, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Peck says that our aim must be to eliminate neurotic suffering and to work through our legitimate suffering in order to achieve our individual goals.&lt;ref name="Roadmult" /&gt;

===''People of the Lie''===

First published in 1983, ''People of the Lie: The Hope For Healing Human Evil'' ({{ISBN|0 7126 1857 0}}) followed on from Peck's first book. Peck describes the stories of several people who came to him whom he found particularly resistant to any form of help. He came to think of them as evil and goes on to describe the characteristics of evil in psychological terms, proposing that it could become a psychiatric diagnosis.

===Evil===

Peck discusses [[evil]] in his book ''People of the Lie: The Hope for Healing Human Evil'',&lt;ref name="Liemult"&gt;Peck, M. Scott. (1983, 1988). ''People of the Lie: The hope for healing human evil''. [[Century Hutchinson]].&lt;/ref&gt; and also in a chapter of ''The Road Less Traveled''.&lt;ref name="Roadmult"&gt;Peck, M. Scott. (1978;1992). ''The Road Less Traveled''. [[Arrow Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; Peck characterizes evil as a malignant type of self-righteousness in which there is an active rather than passive refusal to tolerate imperfection (sin) and its consequent guilt.&lt;ref name="Roadmult" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liemult" /&gt; This syndrome results in a [[psychological projection|projection]] of evil onto selected specific innocent victims (often children), which is the paradoxical mechanism by which the People of the Lie commit their evil.&lt;ref name="Liemult"/&gt; Peck argues that these people are the most difficult of all to deal with, and extremely hard to identify.&lt;ref name="Liemult"/&gt; He describes in some detail several individual cases involving his patients. In one case which Peck considers as the most typical because of its subtlety, he describes Roger, a depressed teenage son of respected, well off parents.&lt;ref name="Liemult"/&gt; In a series of parental decisions justified by often subtle distortions of the truth, they exhibit a consistent disregard for their son's feelings, and a consistent willingness to destroy his growth. With false rationality and normality, they aggressively refuse to consider that they are in any way responsible for his resultant depression, eventually suggesting his condition must be incurable and genetic.

Some of his conclusions about the psychiatric condition that he designates as "evil" are derived from his close study of one patient he names Charlene.&lt;ref name="Liemult" /&gt; Although Charlene is not dangerous, she is ultimately unable to have [[empathy]] for others in any way. According to Peck, people like her see others as play things or tools to be manipulated for their own uses or entertainment. Peck states that these people are rarely seen by psychiatrists, and have never been treated successfully.

Evil is described by Peck as "militant ignorance". The original [[Judeo-Christian]] concept of "[[sin]]" is as a process that leads us to "miss the mark" and fall short of perfection.&lt;ref name="Liemult" /&gt; Peck argues that while most people are conscious of this, at least on some level, those that are evil actively and militantly refuse this consciousness. Peck considers those he calls evil to be attempting to escape and hide from their own conscience (through self-deception), and views this as being quite distinct from the apparent absence of conscience evident in [[Psychopathy|sociopathy]].&lt;ref name="Liemult" /&gt;

According to Peck an evil person:&lt;ref name="Roadmult" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liemult" /&gt;
* Is consistently self-deceiving, with the intent of avoiding guilt and maintaining a self-image of perfection
* Deceives others as a consequence of their own self-deception
* Projects his or her evils and sins onto very specific targets ([[scapegoat]]s) while being apparently normal with everyone else ("their insensitivity toward him was selective" (Peck, 1983/1988, p 105&lt;ref name="Liemult" /&gt;))
* Commonly hates with the pretense of love, for the purposes of self-deception as much as deception of others
* Abuses political (emotional) power ("the imposition of one's will upon others by overt or covert coercion" (Peck, 1978/1992, p298&lt;ref name="Roadmult" /&gt;))
* Maintains a high level of respectability, and lies incessantly in order to do so
* Is consistent in his or her sins. Evil persons are characterized not so much by the magnitude of their sins, but by their consistency (of destructiveness)
* Is unable to think from the viewpoint of their victim ([[scapegoat]])
* Has a covert intolerance to criticism and other forms of narcissistic injury

Most evil people realize the evil deep within themselves but are unable to ''tolerate the pain of introspection'', or admit to themselves that they are evil. Thus, they constantly run away from their evil by putting themselves in a position of ''moral superiority'' and putting the focus of evil on others. Evil is an extreme form of what Scott Peck, in ''The Road Less Traveled'', calls a ''' character and personality disorder'''.&lt;ref name="Roadmult" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liemult" /&gt;

Using the [[My Lai Massacre]] as a case study Peck also examines group evil, discussing how human group morality is strikingly less than individual morality.&lt;ref name="Liemult" /&gt; Partly, he considers this to be a result of specialization, which allows people to avoid individual responsibility and pass the buck, resulting in a reduction of group conscience.

Though the topic of evil has historically been the domain of religion,&lt;ref name="Liemult" /&gt; Peck makes great efforts to keep much of his discussion on a scientific basis, explaining the specific psychological mechanisms by which evil operates. He was also particularly conscious of the danger of a psychology of evil being misused for personal or political ends.&lt;ref name="Liemult" /&gt; Peck considered that such a psychology should be used with great care, as falsely labeling people as evil is one of the very characteristics of evil. He argued that a diagnosis of evil should come from the standpoint of healing and safety for its victims, but also with the possibility even if remote, that the evil themselves may be cured.

Ultimately Peck says that evil arises out of free choice. He describes it thus: Every person stands at a crossroads, with one path leading to God, and the other path leading to the devil. The path of God is the right path, and accepting this path is akin to submission to a higher power. However, if a person wants to convince himself and others that he has free choice, he would rather take a path which cannot be attributed to its being the right path. Thus, he chooses the path of evil.

Peck also discussed the question of the devil.&lt;ref name="Liemult" /&gt; Initially he believed, as with ‘99% of psychiatrists and the majority of clergy’ (Peck, 1983/1988,&lt;ref name="Liemult" /&gt; p182), that the devil did not exist; but, after starting to believe in the reality of human evil, he then began to contemplate the reality of spiritual evil. Eventually, after having been referred several possible cases of possession and being involved in two exorcisms, he was converted to a belief in the existence of Satan. Peck considered people who are possessed as being victims of evil, but of not being evil themselves.  Peck however considered possession to be rare, and human evil common. He did believe there was some relationship between Satan and human evil, but was unsure of its exact nature. Peck's writings and views on possession and exorcism are to some extent influenced and based on specific accounts by [[Malachi Martin]], however the veracity of these accounts and Peck's own diagnostic approach to possession have both since been questioned by a Catholic priest who is a professor of theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Woods, Richard |title= The devil you know|publisher=Open Publishing |date=April 29, 2005 |work=National Catholic Reporter |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_26_41/ai_n13679235/ |accessdate=2009-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that it is not possible to find formal records to establish the veracity of Father [[Malachi Martin]]'s described cases of possession, as all exorcism files are sealed by the [[Archdiocese of New York]], where all but one of the cases took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kennedy, William H. |title=In Defense of Father Malachi Martin |date=July 1, 2002 |work=Seattle Catholic July 2002 (updated March 2003) |url=http://geocities.com/whkinfo1/malachi_martinsophia.htm |accessdate=2009-06-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026111504/http://geocities.com/whkinfo1/malachi_martinsophia.htm |archivedate=October 26, 2009 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Love===

His perspective on love (in ''The Road Less Traveled'') is that love is not a ''feeling'', it is an ''activity'' and an ''investment''. He defines love as, "The will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth" (Peck, 1978/1992,&lt;ref name="Roadmult" /&gt; p85). Love is primarily actions towards nurturing the spiritual growth of another.

Peck seeks to differentiate between love and [[cathexis]]. Cathexis is what explains [[sexual attraction]], the instinct for cuddling pets and pinching babies cheeks. However, cathexis is not love. All the same, true love cannot begin in isolation, a certain amount of cathexis is necessary to get sufficiently close to be able to truly love.

Once through the cathexis stage, the work of love begins. It is not a feeling. It consists of what you do for another person. As Peck says in ''The Road Less Traveled'', "Love is as love does." It is about giving yourself and the other person what they need to grow. It is about truly knowing and understanding them.

===The four stages of spiritual development===

Peck postulates that there are four stages of human spiritual development:&lt;ref name="Drummult"&gt;Peck, M. Scott. (1987). ''The Different Drum: Community Making and Peace ''. Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Furtheralongmult"&gt;Peck, M. Scott. (1993). ''Further Along the Road Less Traveled: The Unending Journey Toward Spiritual Growth''. Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Stage I''' is chaotic, disordered, and reckless. Very young children are in Stage I. They tend to defy and disobey, and are unwilling to accept a ''will greater than their own''. They are extremely egoistic and lack empathy for others. Many criminals are people who have never grown out of Stage I.
* '''Stage II''' is the stage at which a person has blind [[faith]] in authority figures and sees the world as divided simply into good and evil, right and wrong, us and them. Once children learn to obey their parents and other authority figures, often out of fear or shame, they reach Stage II. Many so-called religious people are essentially Stage II people, in the sense that they have blind faith in God, and do not question His existence. With blind faith comes [[humility]] and a willingness to obey and serve. The majority of good, law-abiding citizens never move out of Stage II.
* '''Stage III''' is the stage of scientific [[skepticism]] and questioning. A Stage III person does not accept things on faith but only accepts them if ''convinced'' logically. Many people working in scientific and technological research are in Stage III. They often reject the existence of spiritual or supernatural forces since these are difficult to measure or prove scientifically. Those who do retain their spiritual beliefs, move away from the simple, official doctrines of fundamentalism.
* '''Stage IV''' is the stage where an individual starts enjoying the mystery and beauty of [[nature]] and existence. While retaining skepticism, he starts perceiving grand patterns in nature and develops a deeper understanding of good and evil, forgiveness and mercy, compassion and love. His religiousness and [[spirituality]] differ significantly from that of a Stage II person, in the sense that he does not accept things through blind faith or out of fear, but does so because of ''genuine'' belief, and he does not judge people harshly or seek to inflict punishment on them for their transgressions. This is the stage of loving others as yourself, losing your attachment to your ego, and forgiving your enemies. Stage IV people are labeled as ''[[mysticism|Mystic]]s''.

Peck argues that while transitions from Stage I to Stage II are sharp, transitions from Stage III to Stage IV are gradual. Nonetheless, these changes are very noticeable and mark a significant difference in the [[personality development|personality]] of the individual.

===Community building===

In his book ''The Different Drum: Community Making and Peace&lt;ref name="Drummult" /&gt;'', Peck says that community has three essential ingredients:

* [[Inclusion (value and practice)|Inclusivity]]
* [[Promise|Commitment]]
* [[Consensus]]

Based on his experience with community building workshops, Peck says that community building typically goes through four stages:

* '''Pseudocommunity''': In the first stage, well-intentioned people try to demonstrate their ability to be friendly and sociable, but they do not really delve beneath the surface of each other's ideas or emotions.  They use obvious generalities and mutually established stereotypes in speech.  Instead of conflict ''resolution'', pseudocommunity involves conflict ''avoidance'', which maintains the appearance or facade of true community.  It also serves only to maintain positive emotions, instead of creating a safe space for honesty and love through bad emotions as well.  While they still remain in this phase, members will never really obtain evolution or change, as individuals or as a bunch.
* '''[[Civil disorder|Chaos]]''': The first step towards real positivity is, paradoxically, a period of negativity. Once the mutually sustained facade of [[bonhomie]] is shed, negative emotions flood through:  Members start to vent their mutual frustrations, annoyances, and differences.  It is a chaotic stage, but Peck describes it as a "beautiful chaos" because it is a sign of healthy growth.  (This relates closely to Dabrowski's concept of  [[Positive Disintegration|disintegration]]).
* '''Emptiness''':  In order to transcend the stage of "Chaos", members are forced to shed that which prevents real communication. Biases and prejudices, need for power and control, self-superiority, and other similar motives which are only mechanisms of self-validation and/or [[wikt:ego|ego]]-protection, must yield to empathy, openness to vulnerability, attention, and trust. Hence this stage does not mean people should be "empty" of thoughts, desires, ideas or opinions. Rather, it refers to emptiness of all mental and emotional ''distortions'' which ''reduce'' one's ability to really share, listen to, and build on those thoughts, ideas, etc. It is often the hardest step in the four-level process, as it necessitates the release of patterns which people develop over time in a subconscious attempt to maintain self-worth and positive emotion. While this is therefore a stage of "[[Fana (Sufism)]]" in a certain sense, it should be viewed not merely as a "death" but as a rebirth—of one's true self at the individual level, and at the social level of the genuine and true '''Community'''.
* '''[[#The meaning of true community|True community]]''': Having worked through emptiness, the people in the community enter a place of complete empathy with one another. There is a great level of tacit understanding. People are able to relate to each other's feelings. Discussions, even when heated, never get sour, and motives are not questioned. A deeper and more sustainable level of happiness obtains between the members, which does not have to be forced. Even and perhaps especially when conflicts arise, it is understood that they are part of positive change.

The four stages of community formation are somewhat related to a [[model (abstract)|model]] in [[organization theory]] for the five stages that a team goes through during development. These five stages are:

* ''Forming'' where the team members have some initial discomfort with each other, but nothing comes out in the open. They are [[Emotional insecurity|insecure]] about their role and position with respect to the team. This corresponds to the initial stage of pseudocommunity.
* ''Storming'' where the team members start arguing heatedly, and differences and insecurities come out in the open. This corresponds to the second stage given by Scott Peck, namely chaos.
* ''Norming'' where the team members lay out rules and guidelines for interaction that help define the roles and responsibilities of each person. This corresponds to emptiness, where the community members think within and empty themselves of their obsessions in order to be able to accept and listen to others.
* ''Performing'' where the team finally starts working as a cohesive whole, and to effectively achieve the tasks set of themselves. In this stage individuals are aided by the group as a whole, where necessary, in order to move further collectively than they could achieve as a group of separated individuals.
* ''Transforming'' This corresponds to the stage of true community. This represents the stage of celebration, and when individuals leave, as they invariably must, there is a genuine feeling of [[grief]], and a desire to meet again. Traditionally, this stage was often called "Mourning".

It is in this third stage that Peck's community-building methods differ in principle from team development. While teams in business organizations need to develop explicit rules, guidelines and protocols during the ''norming'' stage, the ''emptiness'' stage of community building is characterized, not by laying down the rules explicitly, but by shedding the resistance within the minds of the individuals.

Peck started the Foundation for Community Encouragement (FCE) to promote the formation of communities, which, he argues, are a first step towards uniting humanity and saving us from self-destruction.

The [http://blueheronfarm.weebly.com/ Blue Heron Farm] is an [[intentional community]] in central [[North Carolina]], whose founders stated that they were inspired by Peck's writings on community. Peck himself had no involvement with this project.

The [http://exosphe.re Exosphere Academy of Science &amp; the Arts] uses community building in their teaching methodology to help students practice deeper communication, remove their "masks," and feel more comfortable collaborating and building innovative projects and startups. 

===Characteristics of true community===

Peck describes what he considers to be the most salient characteristics of a true community:&lt;ref name="Drummult"/&gt;
* '''Inclusivity, commitment and consensus''': Members accept and embrace each other, celebrating their individuality and transcending their differences.  They commit themselves to the effort and the people involved. They make decisions and reconcile their differences through consensus.
* '''Realism''': Members bring together multiple perspectives to better understand the whole context of the situation. Decisions are more well-rounded and humble, rather than one-sided and arrogant.
* '''Contemplation''': Members examine themselves. They are individually and collectively self-aware of the world outside themselves, the world inside themselves, and the relationship between the two.
* '''A safe place''': Members allow others to share their vulnerability, heal themselves, and express who they truly are.
* '''A laboratory for personal disarmament''': Members experientially discover the rules for peacemaking and embrace its virtues. They feel and express [[compassion]] and respect for each other as fellow human beings.
* '''A group that can fight gracefully''': Members resolve conflicts with wisdom and grace. They listen and understand, respect each other's gifts, accept each other's limitations, celebrate their differences, bind each other's wounds, and commit to a struggle together rather than against each other.
* '''A group of all leaders''': Members harness the "flow of leadership" to make decisions and set a course of action. It is the spirit of community itself that leads, and not any single individual.
* '''A spirit''': The true spirit of community is the spirit of [[peace]], love, [[wisdom]] and power. Members may view the source of this spirit as an outgrowth of the collective self or as the manifestation of a Higher Will.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2422">'''Mari ibn Suleiman''' or '''Sulaiman''' ({{lang-ar|ماري إبن سليمان}} also known as {{lang|ar|عمرو إبن متى}}, ''Amru ibn Matta'') was a 12th-century [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christian]] author writing in [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

Nothing is known of his life. He is the author of a theological and historiographical work known as the '''Book of the Tower''' (''Kitāb al-Majdal'').
The work consists of seven parts.
The first is a general introduction, the second a theological treatise on Nestorian [[Christology]], the third discusses [[Baptism]] and [[Eucharist]], the fourth the [[seven virtues]] (piety, charity, prayer, fasting, pity, humility, chastity), the fifth on the "seven pillars" of [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]], [[Last Judgement]], the [[Prophecies]], the [[Second coming of Christ|coming of the Messiah]], the history of the [[Eastern Church]], the history of [[heresies]], and the [[biblical canon|canon of biblical texts]]. The sixth part presents the four "moats" of the Tower, as prayer, the observation of the [[Day of the Lord]], candles and incense, and penitence.
The seventh part describes the "gardens" of the Tower, where Christians, liberated from the obligations of Mosaic law, may repose.

The main interest of the work in modern scholarship is the historiographical material in its fifth part, an important testimony of the 11th to 12th-century history of the Eastern Church. The work can be dated approximately from the fact that the history ends with patriarch [[Abdisho III]] (r. 1139&amp;ndash;1148), suggesting a composition in the 1140s.

In the 14th century, another author, [[Amr ibn Matta]], imitated the work, and the two works have often been confused, even in their manuscripts.
The main manuscript for the work is Paris arab. 190 (13th century), besides Paris arab. 191 and 192 (14th century). Three further manuscripts are in the Vatican, one in London.

The first [[Dastur]] '''Meherji Rana''', sometimes known as '''Mayyaji Rana''', was the undisputed [[spirtuality|spiritual]] leader of the [[Parsi]] community in [[India]] during the sixteenth century. He was renowned not just among the Parsis but also other communities on account of his [[piety]], vast knowledge and spiritual powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/what-great-rulers-exemplify-5029108/|title=What great rulers exemplify|last=[[Rohinton Fali Nariman|Nariman]]|first=[[Rohinton Fali Nariman|Rohinton]]|date=January 18, 2018|website=[[The Indian Express]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dastur Meherji was born in a priestly family at [[Navsari]], in 1514. His father's name was [[Rana Jesung]] (thus the name Meherji Rana). India at that time was under the rule of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s.

According to one school of thought Dastur Meherji was a disciple of the mystic saint [[Azar Kayvan|Dastur Azar Kayvan]] whose seat was in [[Patna]]. Dastur Azar Kaiwan's disciples were called '[[yaar]]' (i.e. spiritual friend / spiritual helper). Thus Dastur Meherji is sometimes referred as Dastur Mahiyaar ('[[Mahi-mahi|Mahi]]' being the fish that can see the smallest piece of object even when it Is dark).

Dastur Meherji was adopted by his paternal Uncle [[Vaccha Jesung]] . It is for this reason that in our ceremonies his name is invoked as "Dastur Meherji, Ervad Vaccha",'

It appears the behdins&lt;ref&gt;Literally ''behdin'' means "of the Good Religion", hence a Zoroastrian, it is used especially of lay people.&lt;/ref&gt; of Navsari presented a piece of land near '[[Piplla Wadi]]' in 1573 to Dastur Meherji in recognition of his service to the religion and community. Dastur Meherji Rana is a renowned name in Parsi history and religious tradition mainly because of his very positive influence on the Mughal Emperor, [[Akbar the Great]]. Akbar was born in 1542 and ascended the throne in 1556 at the age of fourteen. Akbar had great love for matters spiritual and philosophical. Although a [[Muslim]] by birth, he was very secular in his outlook and loved to discuss and understand other religious traditions. Hindu [[Brahmin]]s and Christian [[priest]]s would often be invited to his court for religious discussion.

It appears, however, that Dastur Meherji had a deep and lasting influence on Akbar. It is believed Akbar first met Dastur Meherji in 1573 when the former laid siege on [[Surat]]. They appear to have met at a place near [[Kankrakhadi]] (present day [[Rustompura]] in Surat). Impressed with Dastur Meherji's knowledge and personality the Emperor invited Dasturji to his court in [[Delhi]]. Accordingly, Dastur Meherji appears to have visited the Royal Court of Akbar in Delhi off [[Roj Hormazd]], [[Mah Khordod]] 947 Y.Z. (1578 AD). Akbar's Prime Minister [[Abu Fazal]] and historian [[Badaoqi]] also have written about Parsi Priests from Navsari visiting the Royal Court around 1577-1578.

Pleased as the Emperor was with Dastur Meherji's erudition and piety he gave 200 [[vigha]]s of land near '[[Gelkhari]]' in [[Gujarat]], (free of all taxes) for Meherji Rana and his family's sustenance. It was called "Madad-e-Maash".

Akbar was a [[Sufi]] at heart and liked to absorb the good traditions and beliefs of all religions. He also attempted to popularize a new faith called '[[Din-e-Illahi]]', drawing from the beliefs and traditions of various faiths including [[Zoroastrianism]].

It is said Akbar had a fire burning 24 hours at his court and his Prime Minister Abu Fazal was put in charge of maintaining the fire.

Dastur Meherji Rana's prominence and close affinity to the Emperor gave the Parsis as a community national visibility and lame.

In 1579, the priests of Navsari signed a document acknowledging Meherji Rana as their leader and declaring that all religious ceremonies would henceforth be performed only after obtaining his permission. This was the origin of the '[[gaadi]]' (seat) of the High Priest of Navsari. The present High Priest KaiKhooshroo Navroze MeherjiRana is the seventeenth heir to this famous 'gaadi'.

Legend has it that during Dastur Meherji's stay in Delhi a Hindu [[Tantra|Tantrik]] (magician) claimed that with his occult powers he would make two suns shine in the sky. He challenged all holy men in Akbar's kingdom to respond to this '[[miracle]]'. It appears that the magician with the aid of certain spells had launched a metal plate in the sky and the sun's reflection made it appear as If there were two suns in the sky.

Nobody was aware of this trick and attempts by many holy men to thwart the magician failed. However, Dasturjee Meherji Rana arrived, prayed the sacred [[Kushti|Kusti]] prayers and took the name of God. The plate came crashing down, confounding the magician and amazing the whole court.

Inspired by the drama that unfolded the famous musician [[Tansen]] composed a song in '[[Raag Sarang]]' which had the lines "Elahi Parsee Padhe Sho Kabool" (i.e. By God the prayers of Parsees are accepted). Tansen refers to Dasturjee Meherji with the words "Lambi lambi dahadee Shah Mehreyari (Mahiyaar ( Meherji)) tere mukh pi barshat noor" (i.e. Shah Mehriyar, your beard is long, your face is radiant with fame). Tansen in his time was the "[[Sangeet Samrat]]" (King of Classical Music) and one of the jewels (ratna) at the Royal Court.

There is no dire historical reference to the encounter Dastur Meherji had with the magician. However, this has been part of the [[oral tradition]] for more than four centuries.

Dastur Meherji died at a ripe old age on [[Roj Daepadar]] [[Mah Asfandarmad]] 960 Y.Z. (1591 AD). Today even after four centuries since his death the priests in Navsari perform his "[[Baj (ceremony)|baj]]" ceremony every year on Roj Daepadar, Mah Asfandarmad.

At the Atashbehram in Navsari there is a natural formation in the marble slab on the wall facing the Holy Fire, bearing an amazing resemblance to Dastur Meherji. The [[turban]], long beard and uplifted hands are quite clear. Sceptics may dismiss this nature formation as a flight of imagination. For the mystic however, this is Nature's imprint of a Zarathushtrian saint who influenced many lives.

It appears four years after Dastur Meherji's passing away, Akbar granted an additional 300 vighas of land to Dastur Meherji's son who was named Kakiobad. This was in addition to the 200 vighas of land given earlier "[[Madad-e-Maash]]".

The '''Museum of Islamic Art''' in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] is considered one of the greatest in the world, with its exceptional collection of rare woodwork and [[plaster]] artefacts, as well as metal, ceramic, glass, crystal, and textile objects of all periods, from all over the Islamic world.

In recent years, the museum has displayed about 4,500 artefacts in 25 Halls ,&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt; but it houses more than 100,000 objects, with the remainder in storage. The collection includes rare manuscripts of the [[Qur'an]], with some calligraphy written in silver ink, on pages with elaborate borders.

The Museum has conducted archaeological excavations in the [[Fustat]] area and has organized a number of national and international exhibitions. The museum closed for renovations in 2003, and re-opened 8 years later, in August 2010.&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt; The restoration cost nearly US$10 million.&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt;

==History==
Although recognition of the Egyptian Pharaonic art was signalled in Cairo by the establishment in 1858 of the Egyptian Department of Antiquities and the [[Egyptian Museum]], the appreciation of Islamic Art lagged behind. The [[Khedive Ismail]] approved a proposal to establish a Museum of [[Islam|Islamic Art]] in the Courtyard of the [[Baibars|Mosque of Baibars]], but this was not carried out until 1880, when [[Tewfik Pasha|Khedive Tawfiq]] ordered the Ministry of Endowments (ar: الأوقاف - Awqaf) to set it up.

Julius Franz, an Austrian Scholar of Hungarian Descent, the Head of the Technical department at the Awqaf, proposed in 1881 that the ruined Mosque of the [[Fatimid]] Caliph [[al-Hakim Mosque|al-Hakim]], adjacent to the [[Bab Al-Futuh]], to be a provisional seat for the Museum. A Gallery was accordingly furnished there in the eastern arcade, consisting initially of 111 architectural pieces taken from other Monuments.

Matters improved the same year when [[Tewfik Pasha|Khedive Tawfiq]] approved the "Committee of Arab Antiquities", whose duties included running the Arab Museum, and providing it with objects as well as preserving the monuments. As a result, the arcades of the mosque were filled to overflowing. In 1884, a two-storey structure was built in the courtyard to house the collection of 900 objects, although its staff consisted of only one curator and a door keeper.

In 1887 Max Hertz, also [[Austro-Hungarian]], replaced Julius Franz, and began making many changes. He suggested the name of the Museum back then as the gallery of [[Arab Antiquities]] (ar: دار الآثار العربية - Dar Al-Athar Al-Arabiya). By 1895 the collection numbered to 1,641, and the new building became too crowded, so he requested the Awqaf to build a larger Museum. In 1899 the foundations were laid for the present larger building in the [[Bab Al-Khalq]] area of Cairo.

The new and current building was designed by Alfonso Manescalo, and was completed in 1902 in neo-Mamluk style, with its upper storey housing the National Library. The old museum in al Hakim was demolished in the 1970s, during refurbishment of the mosque there.

==Design==
The Museum entirely faces Historic Cairo. It has two entrances; one on the north-eastern side and the other on the south-eastern side. A beautiful garden with a fountain once led to the first entrance but was later removed. The entrance on Port Said Street features a very luxurious facade, rich with decorations and recesses inspired by Islamic architecture in Egypt from various periods. The Museum is a two-storey building; the lower floor contains the exhibition halls and the upper floor contains the general stores. The basement contains a store connected with the Restoration Section.

==Bomb damage==
On January 24, 2014, a car bomb attack targeting the Cairo police headquarters on the other side of the street caused considerable damage to the museum and destroyed many artifacts. It's estimated that 20-30% of the artifacts will need restoration. The blast also severely damaged the building's facade, erasing intricate designs in the Islamic style. The [[Egyptian National Library and Archives]] in the same building was also affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140124-cairo-egypt-museum-islamic-art-bomb-artifacts-destroyed/|title=Cairo Blast Rips Into Islamic Art Museum, Damaging Key Global Collection|date=2014-01-26|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25877201|title=Cairo's Islamic Art Museum bombed|date=2014|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/26/unesco-islamic-museum-cairo-blast|title=Unesco to assess blast damage at Islamic museum in Cairo|last=Cairo|first=Associated Press in|date=2014-01-26|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Press coverage and reviews===
[[File:The miracle staircase in Santa Fe's Loretto Chapel, the subject of legends and myths..JPG|thumb|right|The miracle staircase in Santa Fe's Loretto Chapel]]Two of the investigations recounted in this book received press coverage before its publication. The ''[[Albuquerque Journal]]'' covered Radford's investigation of the KiMo Theater in 2009.&lt;ref name="AlbuquerqueJournal2009"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nathanson|first1=Rick|title=Is the KiMo Theatre really haunted by the spirit of a boy killed there in 1951, or is it an urban legend?|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/lifestyles/0221357lifestyles08-02-09.htm|website=Albuquerque Journal|accessdate=19 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104211540/http://www.abqjournal.com/lifestyles/0221357lifestyles08-02-09.htm|archivedate=4 November 2015|date=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both television station [[KRQE]] and ''[[USA Today]]'' reported on Radford's experiments to identify the cause of the images widely known as the Santa Fe Courthouse Ghost in 2007.&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mygatt|first1=Matt|title=Mystery of Santa Fe ghost revealed|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-10-31-3541979475_x.htm|website=USA Today|accessdate=19 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010032730/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-10-31-3541979475_x.htm|archivedate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KRQE"&gt;{{cite web|title=10/31/07 Noon: Ghost reveled at Santa Fe Courthouse|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPgbSECTncM|website=YouTube|publisher=KRQE|accessdate=19 February 2016|format=Video|date=31 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article for the "Pasatiempo" section of the [[The Santa Fe New Mexican|''Santa Fe New Mexican'']], Robert Nott interviewed Radford about his investigative methods and the psychology behind belief in supernatural phenomena. Regarding the book, Nott wrote, "Using both forensic techniques and journalistic inquiry, Radford makes a pretty good case that La Posada de Santa Fe is not haunted by the ghost of Julia Staab, that a little spirit boy named Bobby does not haunt Albuquerque’s KiMo Theatre, that the Miraculous Staircase in Loretto Chapel isn’t that miraculous, and that La Llorona is nothing more than a rural legend."&lt;ref name="Pasatiempo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nott|first1=Robert|title=Things that go bump in the night|url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/pasatiempo/books/things-that-go-bump-in-the-night/article_1950396e-3ab5-5a2c-9637-3eeb1d3d5975.html|website=Santa Fe New Mexican|accessdate=18 February 2016|date=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer for the ''Cibola Beacon'' was impressed with the author's scholarly research, citing the  "17 references in the 21 pages devoted to the worldwide phenomenon known as 'La Llorona,'" a "five-page index," and, "copious references at the end of each chapter."&lt;ref name="Cibola"&gt;{{cite web|title=Book Review – Mysterious New Mexico|url=http://www.cibolabeacon.com/cibola_living/book-review---mysterious-new-mexico/article_79557dea-642e-11e4-aa52-03abbd1bd0a0.html|website=Cibola Beacon|accessdate=18 February 2016|date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptical writer and podcast host [[Susan Gerbic]] wrote, "You can almost see how he is thinking this through, how best to investigate it. Where are the actual claims that can be tested, researched?

{{Fiqh |marital}}

'''Nikah 'urfi''' is a "customary" [[Sunni Muslim]] [[marriage contract]] that requires a [[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|walī]] (guardian) and witnesses but not to be officially registered with state authorities. Couples repeat the words, "We got married" and pledge commitment, although there are many other informal ways in which people marry 'urfi. Usually a paper, stating that the two are married, is written and at least two witnesses sign it, although others may record their commitment on a cassette tape and use other forms of documentation. Most Arab countries do not recognize 'Urfi [[marriage]]s and do not allow partners to get a 'legal' divorce since the government does not recognize the legality of the marriage in the first place. Sometimes these relationships are a way for people to have sex with each other within what is perceived to be a licit framework. Nevertheless, the relationship is often kept secret from family members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Consuming-Desires-Family-Crisis-Middle/dp/0804761566 Hasso, Frances S. Consuming Desires: Family Crisis and the State in the Middle East (Stanford University Press 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
'Urfi ({{lang-ar|عرفي}}) comes from the Arabic word 'Urf, which means custom, convention, or a customary act. Many Sunnis who adhere to the Ahle-Sunnath Wal Jamath and Sufi point of views have often criticized this practice, and have related it to prostitution. The term '[[Nikah Misyar]]' has not been used as a legal term in historical Sunni jurisprudence, and is argued by many Sunnis to be something new that does not fit in within the Sunni tradition.

In its modern context, 'Urfi is used to connote something that is different from official state ceremony or procedure. Thus a Nikah 'urfi' in an Islamic state may denote something similar to a [[common-law marriage]] in the west, while in some countries, such as Egypt, a Nikah 'Urfi is a marriage that takes place without the public approval of the bride's guardians, even though the contract is officiated by a religious cleric and sometimes by a state representative.

==Legal issues==
There are three criteria for defining legal issues in [[Islamic jurisprudence]] (fiqh):

* ''Shari'': something that is clearly defined in the [[shariah]].
* ''{{'}}Urfi'': conventional or common tradition. An 'Urfi definition is acceptable to the common people without any scientific or shari precision.
* ''Ilmi'': a definition presented by science.

If the shariah defines something, all Muslims must follow that definition. If the shariah is silent on an issue, Muslims should follow the 'Urfi definition.&lt;ref&gt;''Marriage and Morals in Islam'' by Sayyid Muhammad Rizvi.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Urfi marriage has always existed, but for different reasons.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} In the past, it was common among the widows of soldiers who had huge pensions and they did not want to lose it by officially remarrying. Now, however, it is mostly among university students and young couples who cannot afford the high cost of marriage.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Undocumented 'Urfi marriages are increasingly popular among [[Egypt]]ian youth. The high cost of marriage forces many young couples to wait several years before they marry. Conservative Egyptian society forbids sex before marriage, so many young people consider the 'Urfi marriage a solution. 'Urfi marriages are conducted by a [[Muslim]] [[cleric]] in the presence of two witnesses. However, they are not officially registered and are not legally financially binding on the man. Couples married in this way often meet in secret and avoid the expense of renting an apartment. The 'Urfi marriage can be disastrous for the wife in legal terms. If the husband leaves her without granting her a divorce, she had no legal right to seek a divorce since 'Urfi marriage is considered illegal. Her husband could remarry. The wife is in a more difficult position. If the wife remarries, she can be accused of [[polyandry]], which is punishable by seven years in prison in Egypt, or she could remain single for the rest of her life.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The new Egyptian [[law]] (passed in 2000) recognizes the woman's right to seek divorce from an 'Urfi marriage. However, the law denies her alimony and child support.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

There are also controversial, unofficial "'Urfi" marriages, where a couple signs documents declaring themselves married. The couple does not inform their families of the marriage. Many Egyptian clerics are against this type of 'Urfi marriage calling it a cover for pre-marital sex.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

An extreme form of 'Urfi marriage is known as '''zawag al-'urfi''': to give [[prostitution]] an Islamic cover, some women enter into secret marriage contracts with their summer visitors. Known in Egypt as zawag al-'urfi, this contract is made without witnesses and typically ends in divorce by summer's end. Most of Egypt's Islamic scholars condemn this use of zawag al-'urfi.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Traditional Islamic view==
The part of a contract of marriage that is absolutely necessary, according to all Islamic schools – Sunni as well as [[Shi'ah]] – is that it is agreed to by the man and the woman to be married and whether it is verbal or written makes no difference, hence the witnesses. The additional requirement is bride's dower or [[mahr]] to be paid by the man to the woman; this marriage gift may be in fiscal form (money, gold etc.) or chattel (goods, clothes etc.) or may be promissory payment at future date or in the event of husband divorcing the wife by [[Divorce (Islamic)|talaq]]. It thus includes what Western lawyers consider the three requirements of a contract, i.e. offer, acceptance and consideration (money).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Zekrgoo|first=Amir H.|title=The Sacred Art of Marriage: Persian Marriage Certificates of the Qajar Dynasty|publisher=Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to "'urfi marriage" – there are two types of this:{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}
# Where the woman is married in secret, without the agreement of her [[wali]] (guardian). (This is invalid under Sunni Islam.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}})
# It should also be noted that some of the [[fuqaha]]' say that publicizing the marriage is one of the conditions of it being valid; again comparable to Western requirements of traditional [[Judeo-Christian]] marriages.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4611">[[File:UfaBashkirMosque.jpg|thumb|The [[Old Mosque, Ufa]] was constructed by the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly in 1830.]]
The '''Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly''' ({{lang-ru|Оренбургское магометанское духовное собрание}}) was a state-controlled religious administration in the [[Russian Empire]] that had jurisdiction over certain aspects of Islamic activity in [[Siberia]], the [[Idel-Ural|Volga-Ural region]], and parts of [[Central Asia]], including the [[Kazakh steppe]]. It was established in 1788 by order of Russian Empress [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]].

==History==
The Kazakhs were removed from the assembly's jurisdiction in the 1860s as part of a policy to decrease the exposure of the Kazakhs to Tartar influence.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The head position in the assembly was [[mufti]], under whom there were 5 or 6 [[qazi]]s.

===Mufti===

The role of the mufti was established in the assembly's founding documents of 1788, however neither his social status or the scope of his powers were made clear.&lt;ref name=a356&gt;Azamatov, 356.&lt;/ref&gt; The first mufti, Mukhamedzhan Khusainov, immediately began to push for more power, demanding the same status as the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. He met several times with Catherine II in St. Petersburg, and began to see himself as an important political figure in the Volga-Ural region. This worried local Russian administrators, who requested and received permission from Prince [[Alexander Bezborodko]] to severely limit Khusainov's influence and keep him under their control. Local authorities then decreed "his [the mufti's] duty is to administer strictly religious matters, and not to touch secular ones, except when the administrations sees fit to use him for these".&lt;ref&gt;Azamatov, 356-357.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an 1802 decree the mufti could not make any decisions without the consent of his deputies, however this was rarely followed by Khusainov. The first mufti was constantly dogged with lawsuits and complaints concerning bribery, swindling, and failure to follow ''[[salat]]''. Though Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] send a letter supporting Khusainov, and in effect granting him legal immunity, charges over Khusainov's abuse of power continued for the duration of his time as mufti.&lt;ref&gt;Azamatov, 357-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christianity]] continues to remain strong and vital for the life of [[Demographics of Guatemala|Guatemalan society]], but its composition has changed considerably in recent decades.

[[Roman Catholicism]] was the [[State religion|official religion]] in [[Guatemala]] during the colonial era and currently has a special status under the [[Constitution of Guatemala|constitution]].&lt;ref name="state2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=International Religious Freedom Report for 2017: Guatemala |url=http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2017&amp;dlid=281076 |website=www.state.gov |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evangelical]] [[Protestantism]] (Protestants are called ''Evangelicos'' in [[Latin America]]) and later [[Eastern Orthodoxy in Guatemala|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy in Guatemala|Oriental Orthodoxy]] have increased in recent decades. About 42% of Guatemalans are Protestant, chiefly independent [[Evangelicals]] and [[Pentecostal]]s. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] claim rapid growth, especially among the indigenous [[Maya peoples]].

== Religious freedom ==
Article 36 of [[Constitution of Guatemala|Guatemala's constitution]] states that everyone has the right to practice their religion or belief, in public and in private. [[Guatemala]] has had no [[official religion]] since 1882.

==Roman Catholic==
{{main|Roman Catholicism in Guatemala }}
[[File:Catedral Metropolitana, Guatemala City.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Cathedral of Guatemala City|Catedral Metropolitana]], Guatemala City.]]

Catholicism was the established  religion during the colonial era (1519–1821) and reestablished under the [[Concordat of 1854]] until the fall of [[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]] in 1871.  It is common for relevant Mayan practices to be incorporated into Catholic ceremonies and worship when they are sympathetic to the meaning of Catholic belief a phenomenon known as [[inculturation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focolare.org/en/news/2011/07/28/dal-guatemala-il-focolare-scuola-d%E2%80%99inculturazione/ From Guatemala: the focolare, a school of inculturation]. Focolare. July 28, 2011. Retrieved on 2012-01-02.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duffey, Michael K [http://www.docstoc.com/docs/56028436/Guatemalan-Catholics-and-Mayas-the-future-of-dialogue%28Report%29 Guatemalan Catholics and Mayas: The Future of Dialogue]&lt;/ref&gt;
The practice traditional Mayan religion is increasing as a result of the cultural protections established under the peace accords. The government has instituted a policy of providing altars at every Mayan ruin found in the country so that it is easier for traditional Maya to worship.

== [[Protestantism]] ==

Current estimates of the primarily [[Evangelical]] Protestant population of Guatemala are around 40 percent, making it the most Protestant country in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Los evangélicos son mayoría en Guatemala, según datos católicos|url=http://ceirberea.blogdiario.com/1250700720/los-evangelicos-son-mayoria-en-guatemala-segun-datos-catolicos/|work=Diario Evangélico Digital Berea|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clifton|first=Holland|title=ESTIMATED PROTESTANT POPULATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA BY COUNTRIES: 1935-2012|url=http://www.prolades.com/cra/regions/cam/table_protestant_1935_2012.htm|work=PROLADES|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these Protestants are [[Pentecost church]] [[Pentecostals]].&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Garrard-Burnett, ''Protestantism in Guatemala: living in the New Jerusalem'' Austin : University of Texas Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Protestant missionary, Frederick Crowe, arrived in Guatemala in 1843, but Conservative President [[Rafael Carrera]] expelled him in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garrard-Burnett|first=Virginia|title=Protestantism in Guatemala: Living in the New Jerusalem|year=1998|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, TX|isbn=0-292-72817-4|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant missionaries re-entered the country in 1882 under the patronage of Liberal President [[Justo Rufino Barrios]].  These Northern Presbyterian missionaries opened the first permanent Protestant church in the country in Guatemala City, which still exists one block behind the presidential palace in zone 1 of Guatemala City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garrard-Burnett|title=Protestantism in Guatemala|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestants remained a small portion of the population until the late-twentieth century, when various Protestant groups experienced a demographic boom that coincided with the increasing violence of the [[Guatemalan Civil War]].  Two Guatemalan heads of state, General [[Efraín Ríos Montt]], who in 2013 was found guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity, and [[Jorge Serrano Elías]], have been practicing Protestants.  They are the only two Protestant heads of state in the history of Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garrard-Burnett|title=Protestantism in Guatemala|pages=138–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garrard-Burnett|first=Virginia|title=Terror in the Land of the Holy Spirit: Guatemala under General Efrain Rios Montt 1982-1983|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large portions of the nations Mayan population are Protestants, especially in the northern highlands.

==Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Christianity==
{{Main|Eastern Orthodoxy in Guatemala|Oriental Orthodoxy in Guatemala}}

According to a Guatemalan Orthodox monastery, Orthodox Christianity arrived in Guatemala at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century with immigrants from Lebanon, Russia, and Greece.&lt;ref name=hogar&gt;{{cite web|title=History of The Orthodox Church and Monastery in Guatemala|url=http://hogarafaelayau.org/cms/pages/who-we-are.php|website=Hogar Rafael Ayau|accessdate=12 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910131110/http://hogarafaelayau.org/cms/pages/who-we-are.php|archivedate=10 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s two Catholic women, Mother Ines and Mother Maria, converted to Orthodox Christianity and established a monastery. In 1992 they were received into the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Antiochian Patriarchate]] and in 1995 the Catholic Apostolic Orthodox Antiochian Church in Guatemala was formally established.  The state orphanage of Hogar Rafael Ayau, established in 1857, was privatized and transferred to their care in 1996.&lt;ref name=hogar/&gt;

In 2010 a religious group which had begun as a Catholic movement under a priest, Andrés de Jesús Girón (died 2014, also known as Andrew Giron), was received into the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] by the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] and placed under the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Mexico.&lt;ref name=mayanorthofaq&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brandow|first1=Jesse|title=F.A.Q.|url=

The [[Non-Chalcedonianism|Non-Chalcedonian]] [[Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch]], which is part of the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] communion, received as many as 500,000 converts from a schismatic Catholic denomination in 2013.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}  The Syriac Orthodox Patriarchal Vicariate of Guatemala is led by Archbishop Mor Yacoub Edward.&lt;ref name=ocpsyriac&gt;{{cite web|title=Mor Yacoub Edward Consecrated Archbishop of Guatemala to foster 800000 Roman Catholic converts to Syriac Orthodox Church|url=http://theorthodoxchurch.info/blog/news/2013/03/mor-yacoub-edward-consecrated-archbishop-of-guatemala-to-foster-800000-roman-catholic-converts-to-syriac-orthodox-church/|publisher=Orthodoxy Cognate PAGE® Media Network|accessdate=11 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414170115/http://theorthodoxchurch.info/blog/news/2013/03/mor-yacoub-edward-consecrated-archbishop-of-guatemala-to-foster-800000-roman-catholic-converts-to-syriac-orthodox-church/|archivedate=14 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Eastern and Oriental Orthodox converts are almost largely made up of indigenous [[Maya peoples|Mayans]], a historically persecuted ethnic minority in Guatemala.

Membership grew to a claimed 10,000 by 1966, and 18 years later, when the [[Guatemala City Temple]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/church/temples/guatemala-city-guatemala?lang=eng |title=Guatemala City Guatemala Temple Main |publisher=Lds.org |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta-newsroom.lds.org/topic/temples |title=Temples – LDS Newsroom |publisher=Newsroom.lds.org |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |date=December 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222131747/http://beta-newsroom.lds.org/topic/temples |archivedate=December 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was dedicated in 1984, membership had risen to 40,000.

==Atheism==

{{Main article|Irreligion in Guatemala}}

Estimations of 2000 reveals that there was a significant percent of atheists or people with no religion.&lt;ref name="PROLADES"/&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2017}}

Being "non-religious" in Guatemala can refer to atheism, adherence to no specific religion, or agnosticism. However, there are high percentages of confidence in the church and religious practice.  Officially the country has had no state religion since 1882. According to a national poll in 2000, approximately 18 percent of Guatemalans are not religious, just behind [[El Salvador]] and [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref name="PROLADES"/&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2017}}

'''Roderrick Justin "Rod" Ferrell''' (born March 28, 1980) is an American convicted murderer. He was a member of a loose-knit gang of teenagers from [[Murray, Kentucky]], known as the "Vampire Clan". Ferrell told people that he was a 500-year-old vampire named Vesago, a character he created for himself after becoming obsessed with the role playing game ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]''. In 1998, Ferrell pleaded guilty to the double slaying of a couple from [[Eustis, Florida]], becoming the youngest person in the United States on [[Death Row]]. Originally sentenced to death, Ferrell's penalty has since been reduced to life without parole.

==The killings==
On November 25, 1996 (the week of Thanksgiving), Naomi Ruth Queen and Richard Wendorf were found by their daughter Jennifer Wendorf, beaten to death in their Eustis home.  While 49-year-old Richard Wendorf was asleep on his couch and Ruth was in the shower, Ferrell and accomplice Howard Scott Anderson had entered the home through the unlocked garage, picking up the murder weapon. Before Richard had even awakened, Ferrell beat him multiple times with a [[crowbar (tool)|crowbar]], fracturing both his [[Human skull|skull]] and [[rib]]s, almost instantly knocking him out, and killing him shortly thereafter.  When Ruth had found Ferrell and Anderson in the home moments later, Ferrell bludgeoned her to death, bashing her head with the crowbar. He claimed in his confession, however, that in his original plan, he was going to allow Naomi Ruth to live, but she first attacked him by lunging at him and throwing a very hot cup of coffee on him, which angered him and made him change his mind and kill her also. Richard was found bearing burn marks in the shape of a V. It was said that the V was Ferrell's symbol, which he accompanied with a dot for each person he considered to be in his vampire cult.

The victims were the parents of Heather Wendorf, a long-time friend of Rod's whom he was helping run away from a home that she described as "hell". Heather and the other girls that were with Ferrell and Anderson were not at the Wendorf home when the murders took place. Charity and her friend Dana had driven Heather to her boyfriend's apartment so Heather could say good-bye before leaving for New Orleans, leaving Roderrick and Scott outside the Wendorf home.

After four days of driving through four states, the group was found in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1998-08-14/news/9808130933_1_ferrell-wendorf-vampire-cult|title=Chronology Of The Wendorf Slayings|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed that Ferrell liked a video arcade in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], and they were headed there.  One of the girls, Charity Keesee, placed a call to her mother in [[South Dakota]]. The group needed money, and Charity thought her mother could help them. However, Keesee's mother informed the police about her whereabouts and helped police trick Ferrell, Wendorf, and the rest of the teens into going to a local [[Howard Johnson's]] [[hotel]], where they were arrested by waiting law enforcement. The four were held at a Baton Rouge jail for a week before being [[extradited]] back to Florida, where they were initially booked at the [[Lake County Sheriff's Office (Florida)|Lake County Jail]]. They were later moved to a juvenile facility in [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]].

On February 12, 1998, then-seventeen-year-old Ferrell pleaded guilty to the murders, claiming that the others traveling with him were innocent except Scott Anderson, who was simply an accessory. Ferrell pleaded guilty to two counts of [[Felony murder rule (Florida)|felony murder]]. Ferrell's attorneys tried to argue that he was insane; he has been diagnosed with mental disorders including [[schizotypal personality disorder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1998-02-14/news/9802140696_1_ferrell-myers-vampire|title=Doctor: Ferrell's Lies A `Game'|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Asperger Syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Vampires in America |series=Monsterquest |network=History Channel |date=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Judge]] Jerry T. Lockett sentenced Ferrell to death. Charity Keesee was convicted of two counts of [[third-degree murder]], robbery with a gun or deadly weapon and burglary armed with weapon or explosives. She was sentenced to 10.5 years in state prison. Dana Cooper was convicted of those charges as well, but was given a 17.5 year prison sentence. Anderson was convicted of the same charges as Ferrell and was sentenced to life in prison.

For two years, Ferrell held the record as the youngest inmate on death row until November 2000, when the Florida Supreme Court reduced his sentence to life in prison. Because Florida had long abolished parole, the sentence is without it. 
Keesee was released from prison in March 2006 and Cooper was released from prison in October 2011.

In January 2013, an appellate court has tossed out the latest attempts by convicted Roderrick Ferrell and Howard Scott Anderson to get a new sentencing hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-01-20/news/os-lk-vampire-killers-appeal-20130120_1_mandatory-life-without-parole-sentences-vampire-cult-life-sentences|title=vampire killers appeal|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18266">'''Sigmund Freud's views on religion''' are described in several of his books and essays. [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] regarded God as an illusion, based on the infantile need for a powerful father figure; religion, necessary to help us restrain violent impulses earlier in the development of civilization, can now be set aside in favor of reason and science.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Karen. ''A History of God'' (New York: Ballantine Books 1993) p. 357 {{ISBN|0-345-38456-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud's religious background==
In ''An Autobiographical Study'', originally published in 1925,  Freud recounts that "My parents were Jews, and I have remained a Jew myself." Familiarity with Bible stories, from an age even before he learned to read, had "an enduring effect on the direction of my interest." In 1873, upon attending the University at Vienna, he first encountered [[antisemitism]]: "I found that I was expected to feel myself inferior and an alien because I was a Jew."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''An Autobiographical Study'' (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 1989 [1952]) pp. 13–14. {{ISBN|0-393-00146-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a prefatory note to the Hebrew translation of ''Totem and Taboo'' (1930) Freud describes himself as "an author who is ignorant of the language of holy writ, who is completely estranged from the religion of his fathers—as well as from every other religion" but who remains "in his essential nature a Jew and who has no desire to alter that nature".&lt;ref&gt;"Freud, Sigmind ''Totem and Taboo'' (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co. 1950) p. xi {{ISBN|0-393-00143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Obsessive Actions and Religious Practices''==
In ''Obsessive Actions and Religious Practices'' (1907), his earliest writing about religion, Freud suggests that religion and neurosis are similar products of the human mind:  neurosis, with its compulsive behavior, is "an individual religiosity", and religion, with its repetitive rituals, is a "universal obsessional neurosis."&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Peter, editor, ''The Freud Reader'' (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co. 1995) p. 435 {{ISBN|0-393-31403-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Totem and Taboo''==
In ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'', published in 1913, Freud analyzes the tendency of primitive tribes to promulgate rules against [[incest]] within groups named for [[totem]] animal and objects, and to create [[taboos]] regarding actions, people and things. He notes that taboos (such as that regarding incest) still play a significant role in modern society but that totemism "has long been abandoned as an actuality and replaced by newer forms". Freud believes that an original act of [[patricide]]—the killing and devouring of "the violent primal father" was remembered and re-enacted as a "totem meal...mankind's earliest festival" which was "the beginning of so many things—of social organization, of moral restrictions and of religion".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmind ''Totem and Taboo'' (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co. 1950) pp. x, 142 {{ISBN|0-393-00143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud develops this idea further in ''Moses and Monotheism'', his last book, discussed below. He further goes to attribute creation of gods to humans: "...we know that, like gods, [demons] are only the product of the psychic powers of man; they have been created from and out of something."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund "Totem and Taboo" (chapter 2, kindle edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''An Autobiographical Study'' Freud elaborated on the core idea of ''Totem and Taboo'': "This view of religion throws a particularly clear light upon the psychological basis of Christianity, in which, it may be added, the ceremony of the totem-feast still survives with but little distortion in the form of Communion."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''An Autobiographical Study'' (New York:W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 1989 [1952]) pp. 130–131 {{ISBN|0-393-00146-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Future of an Illusion''==
In ''[[The Future of an Illusion]]'' (1927),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1961|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud refers to religion as an illusion which is "perhaps the most important item in the psychical inventory of a civilization". In his estimation, religion provides for defense against "the crushingly superior force of nature" and "the urge to rectify the shortcomings of civilization which made themselves painfully felt".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1961|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that all religious beliefs are "illusions and insusceptible of proof."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1961|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud then examines the issue of whether, without religion, people will feel "exempt from all obligation to obey the precepts of civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1961|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that "civilization has little to fear from educated people and brain-workers" in whom secular motives for morality replace religious ones; but he acknowledges the existence of "the great mass of the uneducated and oppressed" who may commit murder if not told that God forbids it, and who must be "held down most severely" unless "the relationship between civilization and religion" undergoes "a fundamental revision".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1961|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud asserts that dogmatic religious training contributes to a weakness of intellect by foreclosing lines of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1961|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that "[I]n the long run nothing can withstand reason and experience, and the contradiction which religion offers to both is all too palpable."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1961|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Peter. ''Freud: A life for our time'' (New York: Norton, 1998) p. 535 {{ISBN|0-393-31826-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book expressed Freud's "hope that in the future science will go beyond religion, and reason will replace faith in God."&lt;ref&gt;Mary K. O'Neill and Salman Aktar, eds, ''On Freud's 'The Future of an Illusion' '' (London: Karnac Books, 2009) p. x {{ISBN|978-1-85575-627-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an afterword to ''An Autobiographical Study'' (1925, revised 1935), Freud states that his "essentially negative" view of religion changed somewhat after ''The Future of an Illusion'';  while religion's  "power lies in the truth which it contains, I showed that that truth was not a material but a historical truth."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''An Autobiographical Study'' (New York:W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 1989 [1952]) pp. 130–131, 138 {{ISBN|0-393-00146-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold Bloom]] calls ''The Future of an Illusion'', "one of the great failures of religious criticism." Bloom believes that Freud underestimated religion, and that as a result his criticisms of it were no more convincing than [[T. S. Eliot]]'s criticisms of psychoanalysis. Bloom suggests that psychoanalysis and [[Christianity]] are both interpretations of the world and of human nature, and that while Freud believed that religious beliefs are illusions and delusions, the same may be said of psychoanalytic theory. In his view nothing is accomplished with regard to either Christianity or psychoanalysis by listing their illusions and delusions.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold. ''The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Civilization and its Discontents''==
In ''[[Civilization and its Discontents]]'', published in 1930, Freud says that man's need for religion could be explained by "a sensation of 'eternity', a feeling as of something limitless, unbounded—as it were, 'oceanic'", and adds, "I cannot discover this 'oceanic' feeling in myself".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''Civilization and its Discontents'' (New York: Norton 1962), pp. 11–12 {{ISBN|0-393-09623-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; Freud suggests that the "oceanic feeling", which his friend [[Romain Rolland]] had described to him in a letter, is a wish fulfillment, related to the child's egoistic need for protection.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, David, ''Cultural Theory and Psychoanalytic Tradition'' (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers Rutgers University 2009) p. 117 {{ISBN|978-1-4128-0859-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Strachey]], editor and translator of this and other works of Freud, describes the main theme of the work as "the irremediable antagonism between the demands of instinct and the restrictions of civilization".&lt;ref&gt;James Strachey, "Editors' Introduction", in Freud, Sigmund, ''Civilization and its Discontents'' (New York: Norton 1962), pp. 11–12 {{ISBN|0-393-09623-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; Freud also treats two other themes, the development of civilization recapitulating individual development, and the personal and social struggle between "Eros" and "Thanatos", life and death urges.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Siegel, "Freud and His Discontents", in ''The New York Times'' for May 8, 2005 https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/books/review/08SIEGELL.html?pagewanted=print
Accessed January 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud expresses deep pessimism about the odds of humanity's reason triumphing over its destructive forces. He added a final sentence to the book in a 1931 edition, when the threat of Hitler was already becoming apparent: "But who can foresee with what success and with what result?"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''Civilization and its Discontents'' (New York: Norton 1962), pp. 92 and editor's footnote {{ISBN|0-393-09623-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Atheist political philosopher [[Christopher Hitchens]] cited this book as a reason behind Freud being one of his most influential figures. Hitchens described the book as a "pessimistic unillusioned tale of realism," noting that Freud "wasted little time in identifying [the need for religion] as infantile" and pointing out a summary by Freud's biographer [[Ernest Jones]] that "Human happiness, therefore, does not seem to be the purpose of the universe." &lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''Civilization and its Discontents'' (New York/London W.W. Norton 2010), pp. 9-20 introduction {{ISBN|0-393-30451-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Moses and Monotheism''==
[[File:'Moses' by Michelangelo JBU140.jpg|thumb|right|Moses by Michelangelo]]
''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'' was Freud's last book, published in 1939, the year of his death. In it, Freud makes certain guesses and assumptions about [[Moses]] as a historical figure, particularly that he was not born Jewish but was adopted by Jews (the opposite of the Biblical story) and that he was murdered by his followers, who then via [[reaction formation]] revered him and became irrevocably committed to the monotheistic idea he represented.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''Moses and Monotheism'' (New York: Vintage Books 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edmundson, "Defender of the Faith?" ''The New York Times'' September 9, 2007 https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/magazine/09wwln-lede-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 Accessed January 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Edmundson comments that in writing ''Moses and Monotheism'', Freud, while not abandoning his atheism, perceived for the first time a value in the abstract form of monotheism—the worship of an invisible God, without Jesus or saints—practiced by the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edmundson, "Defender of the Faith?" ''The New York Times'' September 9, 2007 https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/magazine/09wwln-lede-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 Accessed January 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

It gave them an advantage in all activities that involved making an abstract model of experience, in words or numbers or lines, and working with the abstraction to achieve control over nature or to bring humane order to life. Freud calls this internalizing process an “advance in intellectuality,” and he credits it directly to religion.}}

In ''Moses and Monotheism'', Freud proposed that Moses had been a priest of [[Akhenaten]] who fled Egypt after the pharaoh's death and perpetuated monotheism through a different religion.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, Volume XXIII (1937-1939)'', "Moses and monotheism". London: [[Hogarth Press]], 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jay Geller, ''Moses and Monotheism'' is full of "false starts, deferred conclusions, repetitions, rationalizations, defensive self-justifications, questionable methods, and weak arguments that are readily acknowledged as such by Freud."&lt;ref&gt;Jay Geller, "A PALEONTOLOGICAL VIEW OF FREUD'S STUDY OF RELIGION: UNEARTHING THE LEITFOSSIL CIRCUMCISION" Modern Judaism 13 (1993): 49–70 http://mj.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/1/49.full.pdf Accessed January 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Question of a Weltanschauung''==
The later developments in Freud’s views on religion are summarized in his lecture on the Question of a Weltanschauung, Vienna, 1932.  There he describes the struggles of science in its relations with three other powers: art, philosophy and religion.
  
Art is an illusion of some sort and a long story.  Philosophy goes astray in its method.  Religion constructed a consistent and self-contained ''Weltanschauung'' to an unparalleled degree.  By comparison science is marked by certain negative characteristics.  Among them it asserts that there are no sources of knowledge of the universe other than the intellectual working over of carefully scrutinized observations, and none that is derived from revelation, intuition or divination.
  
&lt;small&gt;''In this Freudian summary there is nothing that is heard about the dialects of leaders, nor of multitudes, nor disciplines that are rarely heard of outside of Ivy League institutions, which always seem to think that science is supposed to have Aristotle in it.  Nothing is said about High Schools, where it is well known that it must have started up at some time around the seventeenth century, or around there somewhere anyway.  No discussion is heard about the understandings of any scientists, whatever they are, or artists, no philosophers come up, no Ayatollahs nor Bishops are heard of.''&lt;/small&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
  
On relations between science and philosophy and science and religion Freud has this much to say in one sentence: “It is not permissible to declare that science is one field of human mental activity and that religion and philosophy are others, at least equal in value, and that science has no business to interfere with the other two: that they all have an equal claim to be true and that everyone is at liberty to choose from which he will draw his convictions and in which he will place his belief.”  Then he goes on to say that such an impermissible view is regarded as superior and tolerant, but that it is not tenable, that it shares all the pernicious features of an entirely unscientific Weltanschauung and that it is equivalent to one in practice.

With respect to religion in particular he explains that a religious person had once been feeble and helpless.  A parent had protected him.  Later such a person gets more insight into the perils of life and he rightly concludes that fundamentally he still remains just as helpless as he was in his childhood.

Then he harks back to the mnemic image.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'', New York: W. W. Norton and Company, 1965, pages 195-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses and criticisms==
In a 1949 essay in [[Commentary (magazine)|''Commentary'' magazine]], [[Irving Kristol]] says that Freud exposed what he believed to be the irrationality of religion without evidence, but has not substituted anything beyond "a mythology of rational despair".&lt;ref&gt;Irving Kristol, "God and the Psychoanalysts: Can Freud and Religion Be Reconciled?" ''Commentary Magazine'' November 1949 http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/god-and-the-psychoanalysts-br-em-can-freud-and-religion-be-reconciled-em--906 Accessed January 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1950 book entitled ''Christianity and Freud'', Benjamin Gilbert Sanders draws parallels between the theory of [[psychoanalysis]] and [[Christian religion]], referring to [[Jesus Christ]] as "the Great Psychiatrist" and Christians' love for Christ as "a more positive form of the Transference."&lt;ref&gt;"Freudian Christianity", Time Magazine, February 6, 1950 http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,811843,00.html Accessed January 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karen Armstrong]] notes in ''[[A History of God]]'' that "not all psychoanalysts agreed with Freud's view of God," citing [[Alfred Adler]], who believed God was a projection which had been "helpful to humanity", and [[C.G. Jung]], who, when asked whether he believed in God, said "Difficult to answer, I know. I don't need to believe. I know."&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Karen. ''A History of God'' (New York: Ballantine Books 1993) p. 357 {{ISBN|0-345-38456-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tony Campolo]], founder of the Evangelical Association for the Promotion of Education, observes that "With Freud, God, and the need for God-dictated restraints, had been abolished,"&lt;ref&gt;Tony Campolo, "Religion After Freud", Huffington Post January 31, 2007 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-campolo/religion-after-freud_b_40071.html Accessed January 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in an increase in social chaos and unhappiness which could have been avoided by adherence to religion.

A number of critics draw the parallel between religious beliefs and Freud's theories, that neither can be scientifically proven, but only experienced subjectively. Lee Siegel writes that "you either grasp the reality of Freud's dynamic notion of the subconscious intuitively&amp;nbsp;– the way, in fact, you do or do not grasp the truthfulness of [[Ecclesiastes]]&amp;nbsp;– or you cannot accept that it exists."&lt;ref&gt;Lee Siegel, "Freud and His Discontents", in ''The New York Times'' for May 8, 2005 https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/books/review/08SIEGELL.html?pagewanted=print Accessed January 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tom Miller''' (born October 5, 1965 in [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]], Florida), is an American writer, film director, artist, painter, musician, actor, poet, and performance artist.

==Early life==
Miller was adopted by Nathan Anderson Miller and Alfreda Rowena Reed Miller and lived with his aunt, Alice Miriam Reed, who worked as a piano teacher.&lt;ref name = "Bio"&gt;[http://www.geocities.ws/fredink/tombio.htm] Official website bio, Retrieved April 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller showed interest in playing the piano starting at  age three and at the age of 15 he enrolled in an acting school run by Ruth Foreman, Florida's "First Lady of Theater". He worked there as an actor and sound and light technician for five years and appeared in several TV commercials and locally produced television programs.&lt;ref name = "Bio"/&gt;

Miller was inspired to learn to play the bass guitar and record his own songs after listening to bassist [[Paul McCartney]]. He recorded a 45 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] record called “The Underground” at a recording studio when he was 15 years old. During his high school studies, Miller met Charles McWhorter and they began writing and recording songs together. They were joined later by guitarist John Williford and formed the Miami band, Penguin. Over a ten-year period, the band in its various iterations recorded and released five albums. After Penguin, Miller co-founded the band Middle Earth with school friend Don Traub. Middle Earth rehearsed for two years, played only two shows and then disbanded.&lt;ref name = "Bio"/&gt;

==Career==
Miller began his career in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], Florida, in 1984. He performed in the bands Plastic Age, Middle Earth, Penguin, NDolphin, Bill Perry Orchestra,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alligator.org/calendar/event_1cebf71a-a107-11e1-9cde-3cd92bf1cd98.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Space Masons, and Chicago's Vini and the Demons as the bass player&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gainesville.com/article/LK/20050210/News/604153329/GS/&lt;/ref&gt;. He is the author of 45 [[chapbook]]s, and has over 50 CDs to his credit. His poetry has been published in many small press periodicals including ''Ploplop'', ''Abbey'', ''Poetry Motel'', ''Moon'' and Jim Chandler's ''Thunder Sandwich''. In September of 2014, Miller wrote an interactive hyperlinked narrative entitled ''Project r'', which explores the concept of reality using a mixture of Miller's stories, poems, articles and blogs and also has some autobiographical content. Miller is also the writer of the play, UMMU, another piece exploring the nature of reality. Tom Miller's UMMU was presented at the Acrosstown Theatre in Gainesville, Florida as a staged reading in July of 2015 &lt;ref&gt;https://www.alligator.org/the_avenue/art_and_theater/performance-artist-hosts-staged-reading/article_c23e1c04-206e-11e5-b36c-a7fa717ef5ea.html&lt;/ref&gt;. It was later made into a fully produced and cast play and had its debut at the Acrosstown Theatre in Gainesville, Florida on May 12, 2017 &lt;ref&gt;https://www.wuft.org/news/2017/05/11/things-get-real-in-tom-millers-unreal-world-of-ummu/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Miller is the writer and director of more than 100 independent video films. Miller has also directed the play, Sunset Village off-Broadway at the 14th Street Y Theatre &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gainesvilledowntown.com/2018/08/sunset-village-ready-for-new-york-city-close-up/&lt;/ref&gt;. He is also known for performance art stunts including a naked press conference &lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&amp;dat=19950502&amp;id=IERWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=reoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1136,282314&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;, a 17-hour reading of [[Truman Capote]]'s ''In Cold Blood''&lt;ref&gt;http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00028290/00253/3j&lt;/ref&gt; and frequent UFO secrecy protests.&lt;ref&gt;http://fredink.angelfire.com/ufo.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 he conducted a 30-hour marathon to raise awareness of [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] by watching the entire ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' television series, the two-hour pilot, and the film Twin Peaks, Fire Walk With Me - all while consuming only products popularized by the series: coffee, doughnuts, and cherry pie.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101216/COLUMNISTS/101219718&lt;/ref&gt; In November of 2013, Miller composed and released a music album called Tom Miller Plays the iPhone. "He is the first solo artist to create an entire ambient iPhone album in under five hours.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alligator.org/calendar/event_d996889e-4895-11e3-b028-2b38605a299a.html?mode=jqm&lt;/ref&gt;" In October of 2015, Miller performed a piece entitled, "Operation Copenhagen" in which members of the public funded a trip to Copenhagen for his fiftieth birthday to eat in what was considered the World's Greatest Restaurant, Noma. Miller said the performance was to demonstrate in no uncertain terms the power of helping each other to achieve dreams. Miller also said he takes inspiration from Chef Rene Redzepi's way of doing things&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alligator.org/the_avenue/lifestyle/article_ea0c220c-3bef-11e5-a6a8-2b203959baef.html&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2016, Miller stared for two hours at a photograph of Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz's Mouth, as reported in the Huffington Post's News of the Weird.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-man-to-stare-at-ted-cruz-mouth-for-two-hours-straight_us_56d09797e4b0871f60eb4037&lt;/ref&gt; Miller also constructed a "Sculpture of Nothing" in the Gainesville Downtown Square, inspired by the artist, John Cage&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gainesville.com/article/LK/20160531/Entertainment/606019415/GS/&lt;/ref&gt;. Miller has painted portraits of many Gainesville celebrities and public figures, including mayor Pegeen Hanrahan, former Gainesville Mayor Craig Lowe,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alligator.org/the_avenue/art_and_theater/article_0c3d6522-b647-11df-8466-001cc4c002e0.html&lt;/ref&gt; former Gainesville chief of police Wayland Clifton, hemp activist and former candidate for Florida governor Michael Geison, and Gainesville's house drag queen at The University Club, The Lady Pearl.

Miller was a candidate for the Gainesville City Commission in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&amp;dat=19950812&amp;id=C0RWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=seoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4054,2516256&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; He was the host of Gainesville's HempFests,&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19950503&amp;id=pMhPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1QcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5112,774851&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; and was a plaintiff among several organizers in a 1995 [[First Amendment]] lawsuit which the city lost, both on its initial filing and on appeal. Miller's avant-garde variety show, The Tom Miller Show,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gainesville.com/article/20050623/SCENE/206230306&lt;/ref&gt; has been a staple of entertainment in Gainesville from 1984 to the present. In its current form, Miller's show is known as the Reverend Angeldust's Tabernacle of Hedonism with your Host, Tom Miller. Miller says the show is the "...longest running variety show in the United States &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gainesvilledowntown.com/2016/07/tom-miller-tries-to-make-sense-of-absurd-world/&lt;/ref&gt;."

Miller has received significant press coverage for his writings, artworks, performances, and activism in Gainesville over the last two decades. He continues touring with live performance art shows, poetry readings, videography, and currently performs on electric bass with various groups.

==Etymology and derived words==
''Aži'' (nominative ''ažiš'') is the [[Avestan]] word for "serpent" or "dragon."&lt;ref&gt;For Azi Dahaka as dragon see: Ingersoll, Ernest, et al., (2013). ''The Illustrated Book of Dragons and Dragon Lore''. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN B00D959PJ0&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[cognate]] to the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] word ''ahi'', "snake," and without a sinister implication.

The original meaning of ''dahāka'' is uncertain. Among the meanings suggested are "stinging" (source uncertain), "burning" (cf. [[Sanskrit]] ''dahana''), "man" or "manlike" (cf. [[Saka language|Khotanese]] ''daha''), "huge" or "foreign" (cf. the [[Dahae]] people and the Vedic [[dasa]]s). In Persian mythology, Dahāka is treated as a proper noun, and is the source of the Ḍaḥḥāk (Zahhāk) of the ''[[Shāhnāme]]''.

The Avestan term ''Aži Dahāka'' and the Middle Persian ''azdahāg'' are the source of the Middle Persian [[Manichaean]] demon of greed ''Az'',&lt;ref&gt;Appears numerous time in, for example: D. N. MacKenzie, ''Mani’s Šābuhragān'', pt. 1 (text and translation), BSOAS 42/3, 1979, pp. 500-34, pt. 2 (glossary and plates), BSOAS 43/2, 1980, pp. 288-310.&lt;/ref&gt; Old Armenian mythological figure ''[[wikt:Աժդահակ|Aždahak]]'', modern [[Persian language|Persian]] ''aždehâ'' / ''aždahâ'' and [[Tajik Persian language|Tajik Persian]] ''azhdahâ'' and [[Urdu language|Urdu]] ''Azhdahā'' (اژدها) as well as the [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] ''ejdîha'' (ئەژدیها) which usually mean "dragon".

Despite the negative aspect of ''Aži Dahāka'' in mythology, dragons have been used on some banners of war throughout the history of [[Iranian peoples]].

The [[Azhdarchidae|Azhdarchid]] group of [[pterosaur]]s are named from a [[Persian Language|Persian]] word for "[[dragon]]" that ultimately comes from ''Aži Dahāka''.

==Aži Dahāka (Dahāg) in Zoroastrian literature==
Aži Dahāka is the most significant and long-lasting of the ''aži''s of the [[Avesta]], the earliest religious texts of [[Zoroastrianism]]. He is described as a monster with three mouths, six eyes, and three heads (presumably meaning three heads with one mouth and two eyes each), cunning, strong and demonic (see [[Polycephaly#Mythological occurrences|Polycephaly]]). But in other respects Aži Dahāka has human qualities, and is never a mere animal.

Aži Dahāka appears in several of the Avestan myths and is mentioned parenthetically in many more places in Zoroastrian literature.

In a post-Avestan Zoroastrian text, the ''Dēnkard'', Aži Dahāka is possessed of all possible sins and evil counsels, the opposite of the good king [[Jamshid|Jam]] (or [[Jamshid]]).  The name Dahāg (Dahāka) is punningly interpreted as meaning "having ten (''dah'') sins."  His mother is Wadag (or Ōdag), herself described as a great sinner, who committed incest with her son.

In the Avesta, Aži Dahāka is said to have lived in the inaccessible fortress of Kuuirinta in the land of Baβri, where he worshipped the yazatas Arədvī Sūrā ([[Anahita|Anāhitā]]), divinity of the rivers, and Vayu, divinity of the storm-wind.  Based on the similarity between Baβri and [[Old Persian]] Bābiru ([[Babylon]]), later Zoroastrians localized Aži Dahāka in Mesopotamia, though the identification is open to doubt. Aži Dahāka asked these two yazatas for power to depopulate the world. Being representatives of the Good, they refused.

In one Avestan text, Aži Dahāka has a brother named Spitiyura.  Together they attack the hero Yima ([[Jamshid]])  and cut him in half with a saw, but are then beaten back by the [[yazata]] [[Atar|Ātar]], the divine spirit of Fire.

According to the post-Avestan texts, following the death of Jam ī Xšēd ([[Jamshid]]), Dahāg gained kingly rule.  Another late Zoroastrian text, the ''Mēnog ī xrad'', says that this was ultimately good, because if Dahāg had not become king, the rule would have been taken by the immortal demon Xešm ([[Aeshma|Aēšma]]), and so evil would have ruled upon earth until the end of the world.

Dahāg is said to have ruled for a thousand years, starting from 100 years after Jam lost his [[Khvarenah]], his royal glory (see [[Jamshid]]).  He is described as a sorcerer who ruled with the aid of demons, the [[daeva]]s (divs).

The Avesta identifies the person who finally disposed of Aži Dahāka as [[Fereydun|Θraētaona]] son of Aθβiya, in Middle Persian called Frēdōn. The Avesta has little to say about the nature of Θraētaona's defeat of Aži Dahāka, other than that it enabled him to liberate Arənavāci and Savaŋhavāci, the two most beautiful women in the world. Later sources, especially the [[Denkard|Dēnkard]], provide more detail. Feyredon is said to have been endowed with the divine radiance of kings (''[[Khvarenah]]'', New Persian ''farr'') for life, and was able to defeat Dahāg, striking him with a mace.  However, when he did so, vermin (snakes, insects and the like) emerged from the wounds, and the god [[Ahura Mazda|Ormazd]] told him not to kill Dahāg, lest the world become infested with these creatures.  Instead, Frēdōn chained Dahāg up and imprisoned him on the mythical Mt. Damāvand (later identified with [[Mount Damavand|Damāvand]], the highest mountain of the [[Alborz]] chain) - an element reminiscent of the Greek myth of [[Prometheus]].

The Middle Persian sources also prophesy that at the end of the world, Dahāg will at last burst his bonds and ravage the world, consuming one in three humans and livestock. [[Garshasp|Kirsāsp]], the ancient hero who had killed the Az ī Srūwar, returns to life to kill Dahāg.

==Zahhāk in the Shāhnāma==
In [[Ferdowsi]]'s epic poem, the [[Shahnameh|Shāhnāmah]], written c. 1000 AD and part of Iranian folklore the legend is retold with the main character given the name of Zahhāk and changed from a supernatural monster into an evil human being.

===Zahhāk in Arabia===
[[File:Zahhak enthroned.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Persia]]n painting, depicting Zahhāk ascending on the royal throne.]]

According to Ferdowsi, Zahhāk was born as the son of a ruler named Merdās ({{lang-fa|مرداس}}). Because of his lineage, he is sometimes called '''Zahhāk-e Tāzī''' ({{lang-fa|ضحاکِ تازی}}), meaning "Zahhāk the [[Tayy#Fifth century|Tayyi]]". He was handsome and clever, but had no stability of character and was easily influenced by evil counsellors. [[Ahriman]] therefore chose him as the tool for his plans for world domination.

When Zahhāk was a young man, Ahriman first appeared to him as a glib, flattering companion, and by degrees convinced him that he ought to kill his own father and take over his territories.  He taught him to dig a deep pit covered over with leaves in a place where Merdās was accustomed to walk; Merdās fell in and was killed.  Zahhāk thus became both [[parricide]] and king at the same time.

Ahriman now took another guise, and presented himself to Zahhāk as a marvellous cook.  After he had presented Zahhāk with many days of sumptuous feasts (introducing meat to the formerly vegetarian human cuisine), Zahhāk was willing to give Ahriman whatever he wanted.  Ahriman merely asked to kiss Zahhāk on his two shoulders.  Zahhāk permitted this; but when Ahriman had touched his lips to Zahhāk's shoulders, he immediately vanished.  At once, two black snakes grew out of Zahhāk's shoulders.  They could not be surgically removed, for as soon as one snake-head had been cut off, another took its place.

Ahriman now appeared to Zahhāk in the form of a skilled physician.  He counselled Zahhāk that the only remedy was to let the snakes remain on his shoulders, and sate their hunger by supplying them with human brains for food every day otherwise the snakes will feed on his own.

===Zahhāk the Emperor===

[[File:Armenian Princess Tigranuhi before wedding with Ajdahak.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Armenia]]n Princess Tigranuhi, daughter of [[Orontes I Sakavakyats]], before wedding with [[Azhdahak (Armenian mythical being)|Ajdahak]]. Azhdahak is identified as [[Astyages]] in Armenian sources.]]
About this time, [[Jamshid]], who was then the ruler of the world, through his arrogance lost his divine right to rule.  Zahhāk presented himself as a savior to those discontented Iranians who wanted a new ruler. Collecting a great army, he marched against Jamshid, who fled when he saw that he could not resist Zahhāk.  Zahhāk hunted Jamshid for many years, and at last caught him and subjected him to a miserable death—he had Jamshid sawn in half.  Zahhāk now became the ruler of the entire world.  Among his slaves were two of Jamshid's daughters, [[Arnavāz]] and [[Shahrnāz]] (the Avestan Arənavāci and Savaŋhavāci).

Zahhāk's two snake heads still craved human brains for food, so every day Zahhāk's spies would seize two men, and execute them so their brains could feed the snakes. Two men, called Armayel and Garmayel, wanted to find a way to rescue people from being killed from the snakes. So they learned cookery and after mastering how to cook great meals, they went to Zahhāk's palace and managed to become the chefs of the palace. Every day, they saved one of the two men and put the brain of a sheep instead of his into the food, but they could not save the lives of both men. Those who were saved were told to flee to the mountains and to faraway plains.

[[File:Ajdahak Dream.jpg|200px|thumb|Ajdahak dream]]

Zahhāk's tyranny over the world lasted for centuries.  But one day Zahhāk had a terrible dream – he thought that three warriors were attacking him, and that the youngest knocked him down with his mace, tied him up, and dragged him off toward a tall mountain.  When Zahhāk woke he was in a panic.  Following the counsel of Arnavāz, he summoned wise men and dream-readers to explain his dream.  They were reluctant to say anything, but one finally said that it was a vision of the end of Zahhāk's reign, that rebels would arise and dispossess Zahhāk of his throne.  He even named the man who would take Zahhāk's place: [[Fereydun]].

Zahhāk now became obsessed with finding this "Fereydun" and destroying him, though he did not know where he lived or who his family was. His spies went everywhere looking for Fereydun, and finally heard that he was but a boy, being nourished on the milk of the marvelous cow Barmāyeh. The spies traced Barmāyeh to the highland meadows where it grazed, but Fereydun had already fled before them.  They killed the cow, but had to return to Zahhāk with their mission unfulfilled.

===Revolution against Zahhāk===
[[File:Faridun defeats Zahhak.jpg|thumb|250px|Fereydun defeats Zahhak]]
{{main| Kāve}}
Zahhāk now tried to consolidate his rule by coercing an assembly of the leading men of the kingdom into signing a document testifying to Zahhāk's righteousness, so that no one could have any excuse for rebellion.  One man spoke out against this charade, a blacksmith named [[Kāva]] (Kaveh).  Before the whole assembly, Kāva told how Zahhāk's minions had murdered seventeen of his eighteen sons so that Zahhāk might feed his snakes' lust for human brains – the last son had been imprisoned, but still lived.

In front of the assembly Zahhāk had to pretend to be merciful, and so released Kāva's son.  But when he tried to get Kāva to sign the document attesting to Zahhāk's justice, Kāva tore up the document, left the court, and raised his blacksmith's apron as a standard of rebellion – the [[Derafsh Kaviani|Kāviyāni Banner]], ''derafsh-e Kāviyānī'' (درفش کاویانی). He proclaimed himself in support of Fereydun as ruler.

Soon many people followed Kāva to the Alborz mountains, where Fereydun was now living. He was now a young man and agreed to lead the people against Zahhāk. He had a mace made for him with a head like that of an ox, and with his brothers and followers, went forth to fight against Zahhāk.  Zahhāk had already left his capital, and it fell to Fereydun with small resistance.  Fereydun freed all of Zahhāk's prisoners, including [[Arnavāz]] and [[Shahrnāz]].

Kondrow, Zahhāk's treasurer, pretended to submit to Fereydun, but when he had a chance he escaped to Zahhāk and told him what had happened. Zahhāk at first dismissed the matter, but when he heard that Fereydun had seated Jamshid's daughters on thrones beside him like his queens, he was incensed and immediately hastened back to his city to attack Fereydun.

When he got there, Zahhāk found his capital held strongly against him, and his army was in peril from the defense of the city.  Seeing that he could not reduce the city, he snuck into his own palace as a spy, and attempted to assassinate Arnavāz and Shahrnāz.  Fereydun struck Zahhāk down with his ox-headed mace, but did not kill him; on the advice of an angel, he bound Zahhāk and imprisoned him in a cave underneath [[Mount Damavand|Mount Damāvand]], binding him with a lion's pelt tied to great nails fixed into the walls of the cavern, where he will remain until the end of the world.  Thus, after a thousand years' tyranny, ended the reign of Zahhāk.

==Place names==

"[[Zahhak Castle]]" is the name of an ancient ruin in Hashtroud [[East Azarbaijan]], [[Iran]] which according to various experts, was inhabited from the second millennia BC until the Timurid era. First excavated in the 19th century by British archeologists, [[Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization]] has been studying the structure in 6 phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.chn.ir/news/?section=2&amp;id=31507 |script-title=قلعه‌زهاك ‌30 قرن ‌مسكوني ‌بود |trans-title=Castle inhabited 30 centuries |publisher=Cultural Heritage News Agency |date=2007-03-04&lt;!--1385/3/4 SH--&gt; |accessdate=2006-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001142816/http://www.chn.ir/news/?section=2&amp;id=31507 |archivedate=2006-10-01 |df=}} {{fa icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other dragons in Iranian tradition==
Besides Aži Dahāka, several other dragons and dragon-like creatures are mentioned in Zoroastrian scripture:
* ''Aži Sruvara'' - the 'horned dragon'
*''Aži Zairita'' - the 'yellow dragon,' that is killed by the hero [[Garshasp|Kərəsāspa]], Middle Persian Kirsāsp. (''Yasna'' 9.1, 9.30; ''Yasht'' 19.19)
* ''Aži Raoiδita'' - the 'red dragon' conceived by [[Angra Mainyu]]'s to bring about the &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''[[daeva]]''-induced winter' that is the reaction to [[Ahura Mazda]]'s creation of the ''[[Airyanem Vaejah]]''. (''Vendidad'' 1.2)
* ''Aži Višāpa'' - the 'dragon of poisonous slaver' that consumes offerings to [[Aban]] if they are made between sunset and sunrise (''Nirangistan'' 48).
* ''Gandarəβa'' - the 'yellow-heeled' monster of the sea 'Vourukasha' that can swallow twelve provinces at once. On emerging to destroy the entire creation of ''Asha'', it too is slain by the hero [[Garshasp|Kərəsāspa]]. (''Yasht'' 5.38, 15.28, 19.41)

==The Aži / Ahi in Indo-Iranian tradition==
{{see also|Proto-Indo-European religion}}
Stories of monstrous serpents who are killed or imprisoned by heroes or divine beings may date back to prehistory, and are found in the [[mythology|myths]] of many Indo-European peoples, including those of the Indo-Iranians, that is, the common ancestors of both the Iranians and [[Vedic civilization|Vedic Indians]].

The most obvious point of comparison is that in [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''ahi'' is a cognate of [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''aži''. However, In Vedic tradition, the only dragon of importance is [[Vritra|Vrtra]], but "there is no Iranian tradition of a dragon such as Indian Vrtra" (Boyce, 1975:91-92) Moreover, while Iranian tradition has numerous dragons, all of which are malevolent, Vedic tradition has only one other dragon besides {{IAST|Vṛtra}} - ''ahi budhnya'', the benevolent 'dragon of the deep.' In the Vedas, gods battle dragons, but in Iranian tradition, this is a function of mortal heroes.

Thus, although it seems clear that dragon-slaying heroes (and gods&lt;!-- don't use "deva" here. Its confusing in an Iranian context --&gt; in the case of the Vedas) "were a part of Indo-Iranian tradition and folklore, it is also apparent that Iran and India developed distinct myths early." (Skjaervø, 1989:192)

Payne|2006|p=39}} Modern scholars theorize that Śubhakarasiṃha may have been an ancestor of the [[Bhauma-Kara dynasty]], which ruled in Odisha between 8th and 10th centuries, and whose kings included people named Śubhakara.{{sfn|Richard K. Payne|2006|p=39}}

According to his biography, Śubhakarasiṃha ascended to the throne as king when he was thirteen years old. Although emerging victorious from a power struggle with his older brothers, he turned over his position to his oldest brother and entered the monastic life. He became well known for his supernatural abilities, and finally settled in [[Nalanda|Nālandā]] where he met the master Dharmagupta. After being instructed by him, Śubhakarasiṃha became a traveling teacher, and was then told by Dharmagupta to go further east to China.{{sfn|Bibhuti Baruah|2000|p=170}}

==Life in China==
When Śubhakarasiṃha arrived in China, he was already eighty years old. Upon his arrival, he became well known for his supernatural abilities, and became favored by [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] of the [[Tang Dynasty]]. It was during this time that he translated several works of Esoteric Buddhism including the ''{{IAST|Mahāvairocana Abhisaṃbodhi Tantra}}''.{{sfn|Bibhuti Baruah|2000|p=170}}

==With Yixing==
According to Robert Sharf, [[Zen|Chán]] Master [[Yi Xing]] (Ch. 一行禅師) was the most eminent of his students. Yixing belonged to the northern school of Chán Buddhism, but this was not seen by [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist]] culture as being fundamentally different from the esoteric teachings of Śubhakarasiṃha.&lt;ref&gt;Sharf, Robert (2001) ''Coming to Terms With Chinese Buddhism: A Reading of the Treasure Store Treatise'': p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Around the turn of the eighth century, the northern school was known for its esoteric practices of [[dharani|dhāraṇīs]] and [[mantra]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Faure, Bernard (1997) ''The Will to Orthodoxy: A Critical Genealogy of Northern Chan Buddhism'': p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Shingon Buddhism==
Śubhakarasiṃha was the first patriarch of the Shingon teachings in China. Following Śubhakarasiṃha, the lineage is traced to his student Chán Master Yixing, then to [[Huiguo]] (Ch. 惠果), and finally to [[Kūkai]] ([[Japanese language|Jp]]. 空海), who brought the teachings of Śubhakarasiṃha and his translation of the ''{{IAST|Mahāvairocana Abhisaṃbodhi Tantra}}'' to [[Japan]].
