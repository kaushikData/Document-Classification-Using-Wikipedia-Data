==Acquisition==
Acquisition can occur from a multitude of methods including 2D images, acquired sensor data and on site sensors.

===Acquisition from 2D images===
{{see also|Photogrammetry}}

3D data acquisition and object reconstruction can be performed using stereo image pairs. Stereo photogrammetry or photogrammetry based on a block of overlapped images is the primary approach for 3D mapping and object reconstruction using 2D images. Close-range photogrammetry has also matured to the level where cameras or digital cameras can be used to capture the close-look images of objects, e.g., buildings, and reconstruct them using the very same theory as the aerial photogrammetry. An example of software which could do this is [[Vexcel]] [[FotoG]] 5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-88825431.html Vexcel FotoG]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=628 3D data acquisition]&lt;/ref&gt; This software has now been replaced by Vexcel [[GeoSynth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vexcel.com/geospatial/geosynth/index.asp |title=Vexcel GeoSynth |access-date=2009-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004101204/http://www.vexcel.com/geospatial/geosynth/index.asp |archive-date=2009-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another similar software program is [[Microsoft Photosynth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://photosynth.net/about.aspx Photosynth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://grail.cs.washington.edu/rome/ 3D data acquisition and object reconstruction using photos]&lt;/ref&gt;

A semi-automatic method for acquiring 3D topologically structured data from 2D aerial stereo images has been presented by [[Sisi Zlatanova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gdmc.nl/zlatanova/thesis/html/refer/ps/sz_jp_kt98.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724152353/http://www.gdmc.nl/zlatanova/thesis/html/refer/ps/sz_jp_kt98.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process involves the manual digitizing of a number of points necessary for automatically reconstructing the 3D objects. Each reconstructed object is validated by superimposition of its wire frame graphics in the stereo model. The topologically structured 3D data is stored in a database and are also used for visualization of the objects. Software used for 3D data acquisition using 2D images include e.g. [[PhotoScan|Agisoft Photoscan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agisoft.com/|title=Agisoft PhotoScan|website=www.agisoft.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RealityCapture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.capturingreality.com/|title=RealityCapture|last=|first=|date=|website=www.capturingreality.com/|language=en|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autodesk 123D Catch, ENSAIS Engineering College TIPHON (Traitement d'Image et PHOtogrammétrie Numérique).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifp.uni-stuttgart.de/publications/commIV/koehl2neu.pdf 3D data acquisition and modeling in a Topographic Information System]&lt;/ref&gt; CyberCity 3D Modeler, [http://www.3dunderworld.org/software/ 3D UNDERWORLD SLS].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite arXiv | title = 3DUNDERWORLD-SLS: An Open-Source Structured-Light Scanning System for Rapid Geometry Acquisition |author1=Kyriakos Herakleous |author2=Charalambos Poullis | year = 2014 | arxiv = 1406.6595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A method for semi-automatic building extraction together with a concept for storing building models alongside terrain and other topographic data in a topographical information system has been developed by Franz Rottensteiner. His approach was based on the integration of building parameter estimations into the photogrammetry process applying a hybrid modeling scheme. Buildings are decomposed into a set of simple primitives that are reconstructed individually and are then combined by Boolean operators. The internal data structure of both the primitives and the compound building models are based on the boundary representation methods&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.commission3.isprs.org/pia/papers/pia03_s2p1.pdf |title=Franz Rottensteiner article |access-date=2009-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220154004/http://www.commission3.isprs.org/pia/papers/pia03_s2p1.pdf |archive-date=2007-12-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Semi-automatic extraction of buildings based on hybrid adjustment using 3D surface models and management of building data in a TIS by F. Rottensteiner&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple images are used in Zeng's approach to surface reconstruction from multiple images. A central idea is to explore the integration of both 3D stereo data and 2D calibrated images. This approach is motivated by the fact that only robust and accurate feature points that survived the geometry scrutiny of multiple images are reconstructed in space. The density insufficiency and the inevitable holes in the stereo data should then be filled in by using information from multiple images. The idea is thus to first construct small surface patches from stereo points, then to progressively propagate only reliable patches in their neighborhood from images into the whole surface using a best-first strategy. The problem thus reduces to searching for an optimal local surface patch going through a given set of stereo points from images.

Multi-spectral images are also used for 3D building detection. The first and last pulse data and the normalized difference vegetation index are used in the process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmis.csiro.au/Hugues.Talbot/dicta2003/cdrom/pdf/0673.pdf Multi-spectral images for 3D building detection]&lt;/ref&gt;

New measurement techniques are also employed to obtain measurements of and between objects from single images by using the projection, or the shadow as well as their combination. This technology is gaining attention given its fast processing time, and far lower cost than stereo measurements. [[GeoTango]] [[SilverEye technology]] is the first of this kind commercial product that can produce very realistic city models and buildings from single satellite and aerial images.

===Acquisition from acquired sensor data===
Semi-Automatic building extraction from LIDAR Data and High-Resolution Images is also a possibility. Again, this approach allows modelling without physically moving towards the location or object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gisdevelopment.net/application/urban/products/mi08_226.htm Semi-Automatic building extraction from LIDAR Data and High-Resolution Image]&lt;/ref&gt; From airborne LIDAR data, digital surface model (DSM) can be generated and then the objects higher than the ground are automatically detected from the DSM. Based on general knowledge about buildings, geometric characteristics such as size, height and shape information are then used to separate the buildings from other objects. The extracted building outlines are then simplified using an orthogonal algorithm to obtain better cartographic quality. Watershed analysis can be conducted to extract the ridgelines of building roofs. The ridgelines as well as slope information are used to classify the buildings per type. The buildings are then reconstructed using three parametric building models (flat, gabled, hipped).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrest.missouri.edu/Projects/NASA/FeatureExtraction-Buildings/Building%20Extraction Building extraction from airborne LIDAR data]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition from on-site sensors===
LIDAR and other terrestrial laser scanning technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://geoweb.ugent.be/3dda/areas/ |title=Terrestrial laser scanning |access-date=2009-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511125642/http://geoweb.ugent.be/3dda/areas/ |archive-date=2009-05-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; offers the fastest, automated way to collect height or distance information. LIDAR or laser for height measurement of buildings is becoming very promising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifp.uni-stuttgart.de/publications/1998/ohio_laser.pdf Terrestrial laser scanning project]&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial applications of both airborne LIDAR and ground laser scanning technology have proven to be fast and accurate methods for building height extraction. The building extraction task is needed to determine building locations, ground elevation, orientations, building size, rooftop heights, etc. Most buildings are described to sufficient details in terms of general polyhedra, i.e., their boundaries can be represented by a set of planar surfaces and straight lines. Further processing such as expressing building footprints as polygons is used for data storing in GIS databases.

Using laser scans and images taken from ground level and a bird's-eye perspective, Fruh and Zakhor present an approach to automatically create textured 3D city models. This approach involves registering and merging the detailed facade models with a complementary airborne model. The airborne modeling process generates a half-meter resolution model with a bird's-eye view of the entire area, containing terrain profile and building tops. Ground-based modeling process results in a detailed model of the building facades. Using the DSM obtained from airborne laser scans, they localize the acquisition vehicle and register the ground-based facades to the airborne model by means of Monte Carlo localization (MCL). Finally, the two models are merged with different resolutions to obtain a 3D model.

Using an airborne laser altimeter, Haala, Brenner and Anders combined height data with the existing ground plans of buildings. The ground plans of buildings had already been acquired either in analog form by maps and plans or digitally in a 2D GIS. The project was done in order to enable an automatic data capture by the integration of these different types of information. Afterwards virtual reality city models are generated in the project by texture processing, e.g. by mapping of terrestrial images. The project demonstrated the feasibility of rapid acquisition of 3D urban GIS. Ground plans proved are another very important source of information for 3D building reconstruction. Compared to results of automatic procedures, these ground plans proved more reliable since they contain aggregated information which has been made explicit by human interpretation. For this reason, ground plans, can considerably reduce costs in a reconstruction project. An example of existing ground plan data usable in building reconstruction is the [[Digital Cadastral DataBase|Digital Cadastral map]], which provides information on the distribution of property, including the borders of all agricultural areas and the ground plans of existing buildings. Additionally information as street names and the usage of buildings (e.g. garage, residential building, office block, industrial building, church) is provided in the form of text symbols. At the moment the Digital Cadastral map is built up as a data base covering an area, mainly composed by digitizing preexisting maps or plans.

===Software===
Software used for airborne laser scanning includes [[OPALS]] (Orientation and Processing of Airborne Laser Scanning data), ...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipf.tuwien.ac.at/opals/opals_docu/index.php OPALS]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost===
* Terrestrial laser scan devices (pulse or phase devices) + processing software generally start at a price of €150,000. Some less precise devices (as the Trimble VX) cost around €75,000.
* Terrestrial LIDAR systems cost around €300,000.
* Systems using regular still cameras mounted on RC helicopters ([[Photogrammetry]]) are also possible, and cost around €25,000. Systems that use still cameras with balloons are even cheaper (around €2,500), but require additional manual processing. As the manual processing takes around 1 month of labor for every day of taking pictures, this is still an expensive solution in the long run.
* Obtaining satellite images is also an expensive endeavor. High resolution stereo images (0.5&amp;nbsp;m resolution) cost around €11,000. Image satellites include Quikbird, Ikonos. High resolution monoscopic images cost around €5,500. Somewhat lower resolution images (e.g. from the CORONA satellite; with a 2&amp;nbsp;m resolution) cost around €1.000 per 2 images. Note that Google Earth images are too low in resolution to make an accurate 3D model.&lt;ref&gt;Ghent University, Department of Geography&lt;/ref&gt;

==Object reconstruction==
{{main article|3D reconstruction}}
{{see also|3D reconstruction from multiple images}}
After the data has been collected, the acquired (and sometimes already processed) data from images or sensors needs to be reconstructed. This may be done in the same program or in some cases, the 3D data needs to be exported and imported into another program for further refining, and/or to add additional data. Such additional data could be gps-location data, ... Also, after the reconstruction, the data might be directly implemented into a local (GIS) map&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.geo.tudelft.nl/frs/papers/2001/ildi_manchester.pdf |title=Implementing data to GIS map |access-date=2009-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030506080319/http://www.geo.tudelft.nl/frs/papers/2001/ildi_manchester.pdf |archive-date=2003-05-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itc.nl/personal/vosselman/papers/suveg2001.bmvc.pdf 3D data implementation to GIS maps]&lt;/ref&gt; or a worldwide map such as [[Google Earth]].

The '''A491''' is an [[A roads in Zone 4 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|A road in Zone 4 of the Great Britain numbering scheme]].

==History==
The road north of [[Oldswinford]] forms part of an ancient road, probably of [[Anglo-Saxon]] origin, joining the [[burh]]s of [[Worcester]] and [[Stafford]].  The crossing of the [[River Stour, Worcestershire|River Stour]] was probably the [[swine]]-ford that gave rise to the placenames [[Kingswinford]] and Oldswinford, and later to the name [[Stourbridge]].&lt;ref&gt;P. W. King, 'Some roads out of north Worcestershire' ''Transactions of Worcestershire Archaeological Society'' 3rd ser. 20 (2006), 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The road from [[Wordsley Green]] to the Market House in Stourbidge and so to Bromsgrove was [[Turnpike trusts in the United Kingdom|turnpiked]] in 1753.  The same act also dealt with several other roads from that Market House, as well as the road from Birmingham through [[Halesowen]] and Hagley to [[Blakedown]] Pool, but that was managed by separate trustees from 1773.&lt;ref&gt;Statutes, 26 Geo. II, c.47; 13 Geo. III, c.107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its continuation north of Wordsley Green, through [[Wolverhampton]], and Stafford to [[Stone, Staffordshire|Stone]], much of it now part of [[A449 road]] was turnpiked by the [[Wolverhampton]] Turnpike Act of 1760.&lt;ref&gt;Statute, 1 Geo. III, c.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original 1922 road numberings, A491 was assigned to the [[Shrewsbury]], [[Welshpool]], [[Mallwyd]] and [[Cemmaes Road]] route, now part of the A458 and A470. The route between Wall Heath and Bromsgrove was assigned the A449 number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Lydiate Ash - Stourbridge===
Starting at junction 4 of the M5, the road heads West on a single carriageway alignment, meeting the B4091 at a roundabout, then becoming a dual carriageway. There are local accesses for the villages of [[Belbroughton]], [[Clent]], [[Romsley, Worcestershire|Romsley]] and [[Holy Cross, Worcestershire|Holy Cross]]. Following a roundabout in [[Hagley]] the A491 is concurrent with the [[A456 road|A456]] for a short period before heading north towards [[Stourbridge]]. At [[Pedmore]] the [[A4036 road|A4036]] leaves at a roundabout towards [[Dudley]]. The A491 then continues to join the Stourbridge ring road.

===Stourbridge - Wall Heath===
The A491 resumes again on the northern side of the Stourbridge ring road. This final section is entirely single carriageway in an urban environment. The road passes through [[Amblecote]], [[Wordsley]] and [[Kingswinford]], passing numerous traffic light controlled junctions, before terminating on the [[A449 road|A449]] at a roundabout just north of [[Wall Heath]].

==Former Routes==
===Bypasses and realignments===
* [[Holy Cross, Clent]] (Now bypassed by a dual carriageway to the North). A cutting through Button Hill, in Holy Cross—through which the road used to pass–was finished in 1834. It was built by men from Lye and Stourbridge during a local recession as a form of [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|poor relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Amphlett |year=1860 |title=A short history of Clent |publisher=Parker |page=175|quote=There was great distress in the Lye and the districts around Stourbridge in 1834 and numbers of men were employed in lowering the cutting in the sandstone rock}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stourbridge Town Centre (Traffic now uses the ring road)

===Downgrading===
* Fairfield - Finstall (Part of this route is now B4091, A448 and unclassified)

The term '''bed load''' or '''bedload''' describes particles in a flowing fluid (usually water) that are transported along the [[stream bed|bed]]. Bed load is complementary to [[suspended load]] and [[wash load]].

Bed load moves by rolling, sliding, and/or [[Saltation (geology)|saltating]] (hopping).

Generally, bed load downstream will be smaller and more rounded than bed load upstream (a process known as [[downstream fining]]).  This is due in part to [[Wear|attrition]] and [[Abrasion (geology)|abrasion]] which results from the stones colliding with each other and against the river channel, thus removing the rough texture ([[Rounding (sediment)|rounding]]) and reducing the size of the particles. However, [[selective transport]] of sediments also plays a role in relation to downstream fining: smaller-than average particles are more easily [[Entrainment (physical geography)|entrained]] than larger-than average particles, since the shear stress required to entrain a grain is linearly proportional to the diameter of the grain. However, the degree of size selectivity is restricted by the '''hiding effect''' described by Parker and Klingeman (1982),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Gary|last2=Klingeman|first2=Peter C.|title=On why gravel bed streams are paved|journal=Water Resources Research|date=2010|volume=18|issue=5|doi=10.1029/WR018i005p01409}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein larger particles protrude from the bed whereas small particles are shielded and hidden by larger particles, with the result that nearly all grain sizes become entrained at nearly the same shear stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashworth|first1=Philip J.|last2=Ferguson|first2=Robert I.|title=Size-selective entrainment of bed load in gravel bed streams|journal=Water Resources Research|date=1989|volume=25|issue=4|doi=10.1029/WR025i004p00627}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Gary|last2=Toro-Escobar|first2=Carlos M.|title=Equal mobility of gravel in streams: The remains of the day|journal=Water Resources Research|date=2002|volume=38|issue=11|doi=10.1029/2001WR000669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental observations suggest that a uniform free-surface flow over a cohesion less plane bed is unable to entrain sediments below a critical value &lt;math&gt;\tau_{*c}&lt;/math&gt; of the ratio between measures of hydrodynamic(destabilizing) and gravitational(stabilizing)
forces acting on sediment particles, the so-called [[Shields parameter|Shields]] stress  &lt;math&gt;\tau_*&lt;/math&gt;. This quantity reads as:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_*=\frac{u^2_*}{(s-1)gd}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;u_{*}&lt;/math&gt; is the friction velocity, s is the relative particle density, d is an effective particle diameter which is entrained by the flow, and g is gravity. Meyer-Peter-Müller &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyer-Peter|first=E|author2=Müller, R.|title=Formulas for bed-load transport|year=1948|series=Proceedings of the 2nd Meeting of the International Association for Hydraulic Structures Research|pages=39–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; formula for the bed load capacity under  equilibrium and uniform flow conditions states that the magnitude of the bed load flux  &lt;math&gt;q_s&lt;/math&gt; for unit width  is proportional to the excess of shear stress with respect to a critical one &lt;math&gt;\tau_{*c} &lt;/math&gt;. Specifically, &lt;math&gt;q_s&lt;/math&gt; is a monotonically increasing nonlinear function of the excess Shields stress &lt;math&gt;\phi(\tau_{*} -\tau_{*c} )&lt;/math&gt;, typically expressed in the form of a power law. .

English also '''Campeachy''',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/search?q=campeachy&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=bks&lt;/ref&gt; is a city in [[Campeche Municipality]] in the state of [[Campeche]], [[Mexico]]—located at {{Coord|19.85|N|90.53|W|}}, on the shore of the [[Bay of Campeche]] of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]—and its municipal seat also serves as the state's capital city. The city's population at the 2010 census was 220,389,&lt;ref name=SEDESOL&gt;{{cite web|title=Campeche|url=http://www.microrregiones.gob.mx/catloc/LocdeMun.aspx?tipo=clave&amp;campo=loc&amp;ent=04&amp;mun=002|work=Catálogo de Localidades|publisher=[[Secretaría de Desarrollo Social]] (SEDESOL)|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the municipality for which it serves as municipal seat had a population of 259,005.&lt;ref name=SEDESOL/&gt;

The city was founded in 1540 by [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]es as '''San Francisco de Campeche''' atop the pre-existing [[Maya civilization|Maya]] city of [[Can Pech]]. The [[Pre-Columbian]] city was described as having 3,000 houses and various monuments, of which little trace remains. 

The city retains many of the old colonial Spanish city walls and fortifications which protected the city (not always successfully) from [[pirate]]s and [[buccaneer]]s. The state of preservation and quality of its architecture earned it the status of a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1999. Originally, the Spaniards lived inside the walled city, while the [[Native American (Americas)|natives]] lived in the surrounding ''barrios'' of San Francisco, Guadalupe and San Román. These barrios still retain their original churches; the one in Guadalupe is almost 500 years old.

{{seealso|Timeline of Campeche City}}
[[File:Facades in Old City with Cathedral at Rear - Campeche - Mexico.jpg|left|thumb|Facades of Colonial buildings with the city's cathedral visible.]]
Founded in 1540 by [[Francisco Montejo]], Campeche was terrorized by pirates and marauders until the city started fortification in 1686.&lt;ref name=CAM/&gt;

San Francisco de Campeche was originally an indigenous [[village]], Ah Kim Pech, where the Spanish first landed in Mexico in 1517. The city of Campeche was founded in 1540 and fortified against pirates during the 17th century. It still has the appearance of a fortress. Historical monuments and buildings, such as the Franciscan cathedral, old [[Maya civilization|Maya]] ruins, and the old city walls and forts, attract many tourists. 

The fortifications system of Campeche, an eminent example of the military architecture of the 17th and 18th centuries, is part of an overall defensive system set up by the Spanish to protect the ports on the [[Caribbean]] Sea from pirate attacks like the 1663 [[Sack of Campeche (1663)|Sack of Campeche]].

The state of preservation and quality of its architecture earned it the status of a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/895|title=Historic Fortified Town of Campeche|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/campeche.html World Heritage Site - Campeche] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821031628/http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/campeche.html |date=2010-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Campeche is an example of [[urbanism]] in a baroque colonial city, with a reticular and regular plan, its urban trace, a model of colonial port cities, reflects the main role that it played as a commercial, religious and military connection point characterized by its high level of integrity and homogeneity. More than one thousand buildings with a historic value have survived as witnesses of space and temporal superimposition of several significant historic periods of Mexico.

Due to the constant attacks of both [[England|English]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] buccaneers and pirates such as [[Francis Drake]], [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]], [[Laurens de Graaf]], [[Cornelis Jol]], Jacobo Jackson, Jean Lafitte, Francisco de Grammont, Bartolomé Portugués, William Parker, Francisco Nau, [[Edward Mansvelt]], [[Henry Morgan]], [[Lewis Scot]], [[Roche Braziliano]] and [[Michel de Grammont]] for almost 160 years, in 1686 the government started to fortify the city.&lt;ref name=CAM&gt;Marley, David (2005) ''Historic cities of the Americas: an illustrated encyclopedia, Volume 1'' p.223. ABC-CLIO, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[France|French]] engineer Louis Bouchard de Becour was commissioned to unify all the defensive works that surrounded the city with a wall. At its completion, the wall surrounding the city of Campeche was 2,560 meters in length, forming an irregular hexagon around the main part of the city, with eight defensive bastions on the corners.  These bulwarks now serve different functions:

* '''Santiago''': Used as the Botanical Garden 'Xmuch´haltún'.  Reconstructed.
* '''San Pedro''': Former prison.
* '''San Francisco''': Protects the Land Gate.  Houses the library of the [[INAH]].
* '''San Juan''': Protects the Land Gate.
* '''Nuestra Señora de la Soledad''': Also protects the Sea Gate.  It is the largest one and holds the Museum of City History.
* '''San Carlos''':  Holds the City Museum.  This fort was the first one built.  Protects the Sea Gate.
* '''Santa Rosa'''.

It also contained four gates to allow access to the main quarters.  The main entrances are the ''Puerta de la tierra'' ("Land Gate"), built in 1732,  and the ''Puerta del mar'' ("Sea Gate").  The Land Gate is kept as a tourist attraction, having a light and sound show three nights each week and keeping original supplies and items from the 17th century. The other gates were Guadalupe and San Román, connecting to the outside [[neighborhoods]].

Additionally, two main forts protected the city from two nearby hills on each side, the forts of San José el Alto (built in 1762) and San Miguel.  These forts gave long-range [[artillery]] coverage and served also as look-outs.  They were built before the walls of the city.  The fort of San Miguel is used as a museum and houses a collection of pre-Hispanic items.  The [[fort]] of San José houses a collection of boats and weapons of the period.

'''Central Norway''' ({{lang-nb|Midt-Norge}}, {{lang-nn|Midt-Noreg}}) is an administrative division that includes the counties of [[Trøndelag]] and [[Møre og Romsdal]] and is used by, for example, the [[Regional health authority (Norway)|regional health authorities]] and the [[Norwegian Public Roads Administration]]. Compared to the traditional regions of [[Norway]] it covers all of [[Trøndelag]] and some of [[Vestlandet]]. It has a total population of just under 760,000 people, with the [[Trondheim Region|Trondheim metropolitan region]] accounting for roughly 275,000.

There has been some political movement towards replacing the counties with larger regions. It is then expected that much of Central Norway, at least Trøndelag and [[Nordmøre]], will form one such region due to the historical, cultural and linguistic ties.

{{singlesource|date=April 2016}}

'''Domdaniel''' is a fictional cavernous hall at the bottom of the ocean where evil magicians, spirits, and gnomes meet. 

==Overview==
Domdaniel was first mentioned in the continued story of the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' by Dom Chaves and Cazotte (1788-1793). It was described as being located in the sea near [[Tunis]]. In this hall, the ruler Zatanai held his court, which included the magician Maugraby and his students.

[[Robert Southey]] later used Domdaniel in his multi-volume oriental poem ''[[Thalaba the Destroyer]]'' (1797). The hero of Southey's story, Thalaba, is the last surviving member of a race called the Hodeirah. It had been prophesied that the spirits of the Domdaniel were destined to be destroyed by one of the Hodeirah, so they sought the end of that race.

One of the magicians named by Southey as dwelling in Domdaniel was Adbaldar. He was selected by lot to hunt down Thal'aba and slay him. But the youth Thalaba accomplishes the destruction of the magicians in the final volume of the poem despite their efforts to kill him and his surviving family.

[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] used Domdaniel in his romance ''[[The House of the Seven Gables]]'': "Hepzibah put her hand into her pocket, and presented the urchin, her earliest and staunchest customer, with silver enough to people the Domdaniel cavern of his interior with as various a procession of quadrupeds as passed into the ark." 

In [[T._H._White|T.H White's]] book ''[[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' Merlin, before his famous duel of magic with the witch [[Madam Mim]], says "Now we shall see how a double first at Dom-Daniel avails against the private tuition of my master Bleise".

[[H. P. Lovecraft]] used Domdaniel in the short story ''He'' (1925), as follows: ''...heard as with the mind's ear the blasphemous domdaniel of cacophony ...''

British author [[Angie Sage]] used the name DomDaniel (styled this way) to name the main foe of her fantasy novel series [[Septimus Heap]].

Domdaniel is the headquarters of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s [[graphic novel]] ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' and includes large underground caverns. Domdaniel secretly served as the headquarters of [[Magneto (comics)|Grand Inquisitor Enrique]] and [[Brotherhood of Mutants|The Brotherhood of those Who Will Inherit the Earth]]. Gaiman also made reference to Domdaniel in [[The Sandman: Dream Country#A Midsummer Night's Dream|''Sandman'' #19]], referring to [[Auberon_(comics)|Auberon]], the King of Faerie, as "Auberon of Dom-Daniel".

'''Edward Osborne Wilson''' (born June 10, 1929), usually cited as '''E. O. Wilson''', is an American biologist, theorist, naturalist and author. His biological specialty is [[myrmecology]], the study of [[ant]]s, on which he has been called the world's leading expert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jun/24/battle-of-the-professors |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Vanessa |last=Thorpe |title=Richard Dawkins in furious row with EO Wilson over theory of evolution |date=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://documentaryhive.com/lord-of-the-ants/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015224600/http://documentaryhive.com/lord-of-the-ants/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 October 2013 |title=Lord of the Ants documentary |publisher=VICE |year=2009 |accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Wilson was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. According to his autobiography ''[[Naturalist (book)|Naturalist]]'', he grew up mostly around [[Washington, D.C.]] and in the countryside around [[Mobile, Alabama]].&lt;ref name="Edward O. Wilson 2006"&gt;Edward O. Wilson&amp;nbsp;– Naturalist, Island Press; (April 24, 2006), {{ISBN|1-59726-088-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an early age, he was interested in natural history. His parents, Edward and Inez Wilson, divorced when he was seven. The young naturalist grew up in several cities and towns, moving around with his father and his stepmother.

In the same year that his parents divorced, Wilson blinded himself in one eye in a fishing accident. He suffered for hours, but he continued fishing.&lt;ref name="Edward O. Wilson 2006" /&gt; He did not complain because he was anxious to stay outdoors. He did not seek medical treatment.&lt;ref name="Edward O. Wilson 2006" /&gt; Several months later, his right pupil clouded over with a [[cataract]].&lt;ref name="Edward O. Wilson 2006" /&gt; He was admitted to [[Pensacola Hospital]] to have the lens removed.&lt;ref name="Edward O.

Although he had lost his [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic vision]], he could still see fine print and the hairs on the bodies of small insects.&lt;ref name="Edward O. Wilson 2006" /&gt; His reduced ability to observe mammals and birds led him to concentrate on [[insect]]s.

At nine, Wilson undertook his first expeditions at the [[Rock Creek Park]] in Washington, DC. He began to collect insects and he gained a passion for butterflies. He would capture them using nets made with brooms, coat hangers, and cheesecloth bags.&lt;ref name="Edward O. Wilson 2006" /&gt; Going on these expeditions led to Wilson's fascination with ants. He describes in his autobiography how one day he pulled the bark of a rotting tree away and discovered [[Acanthomyops|citronella ants]] underneath.&lt;ref name="Edward O. Wilson 2006" /&gt; The worker ants he found were "short, fat, brilliant yellow, and emitted a strong lemony odor".&lt;ref name="Edward O. Wilson 2006" /&gt; Wilson said the event left a "vivid and lasting impression on [him]".&lt;ref name="Edward O. Wilson 2006" /&gt; He also earned the [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] award and served as Nature Director of his [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] summer camp. At the age of 18, intent on becoming an [[entomologist]], he began by collecting [[Diptera|flies]], but the shortage of insect pins caused by World War II caused him to switch to [[ant]]s, which could be stored in vials. With the encouragement of Marion R. Smith, a myrmecologist from the [[National Museum of Natural History]] in Washington, Wilson began a survey of all the ants of [[Alabama]]. This study led him to report the first colony of [[fire ants]] in the US, near the port of Mobile.&lt;ref&gt;first-hand account,{{self-published source|date=April 2014}} Smithsonian Institution talk, April 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Concerned that he might not be able to afford to go to a university, Wilson tried to enlist in the United States Army. He planned to earn U.S. government financial support for his education, but failed the Army medical examination due to his impaired eyesight.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Wilson was able to afford to enroll in the [[University of Alabama]] after all, earning his B.S. and M.S. degrees in biology there in 1950. In 1952 he transferred to [[Harvard University]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
 
Appointed to the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]], he could travel on overseas expeditions, collecting ant species of Cuba and Mexico and travel the South Pacific, including Australia, New Guinea, Fiji, New Caledonia and Sri Lanka. In 1955, he received his Ph.D. and married Irene Kelley.&lt;ref name="Academy of Achievement"&gt;{{cite web |title=Edward O.

==Career==
From 1956 until 1996 Wilson was part of the faculty of Harvard. 
He began as an ant [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomist]] and worked on understanding their evolution, how they developed into new species by escaping environmental disadvantages and moving into new habitats. He developed a theory of the "[[taxon]] cycle".&lt;ref name="Academy of Achievement"/&gt;

Just after completing is PhD in 1955, Wilson started supervising Stuart A. Altmann on the social behavior of rhesus macaques, which gave Wilson a first impetus to imagine sociobiology as a global theory of animal social behavior.&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levallois |first1=Clement |title=The Development of Sociobiology in Relation to Animal Behavior Studies, 1946–1975 |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=2018-09-19 |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=419–444 |doi=10.1007/s10739-017-9491-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He collaborated with mathematician William Bossert, and discovered the chemical nature of ant communication, via [[pheromones]]. In the 1960s he collaborated with mathematician and ecologist [[Robert MacArthur]]. Together, they tested the theory of species equilibrium on a tiny island in the Florida Keys. He eradicated all insect species and observed the re-population by new species. A book ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]'' about this experiment became a standard ecology text.&lt;ref name="Academy of Achievement"/&gt;

In 1971, he published the book ''The Insect Societies'' about the biology of social insects like ants, bees, wasps and termites. In 1973, Wilson was appointed 'Curator of Insects' at the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]]. In 1975, he published the book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'' applying his theories of insect behavior to vertebrates, and in the last chapter, humans. He speculated that evolved and inherited tendencies were responsible for hierarchical social organisation among humans. In 1978 he published ''[[On Human Nature]]'', which dealt with the role of biology in the evolution of human culture and won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for General Nonfiction.&lt;ref name="Academy of Achievement"/&gt;

In 1981 after collaborating with Charles Lumsden, he published ''Genes, Mind and Culture'', a theory of [[gene-culture coevolution]]. In 1990 he published ''[[The Ants]]'', co-written with [[Bert Hölldobler]], his second Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.&lt;ref name="Academy of Achievement"/&gt;

In the 1990s, he published ''The Diversity of Life'' (1992), an autobiography: ''[[Naturalist (book)|Naturalist]]'' (1994), and ''[[Consilience (book)|Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]]'' (1998) about the unity of the natural and social sciences.&lt;ref name="Academy of Achievement"/&gt;

==Retirement==
In 1996, Wilson officially retired from [[Harvard University]], where he continues to hold the positions of [[Emeritus|Professor Emeritus]] and Honorary Curator in Entomology. He founded the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation, which finances the [[PEN/E. O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award]] and is an "independent foundation" at the [[Nicholas School of the Environment]], Duke University. Wilson became a special lecturer at [[Duke University]] as part of the agreement.&lt;ref name="Tenure at Duke"&gt;{{cite web |title='Father of sociobiology' to teach at Nicholas School |work=Post Retirement |url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2013/12/05/father-sociobiology-teach-nicholas-school|publisher= Duke University|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson has published 14 books during the new millennium: ''The Future of Life'', 2002, 
''Pheidole in the New World: A Dominant, Hyperdiverse Ant Genus,'' 2003, 
''From So Simple a Beginning: Darwin's Four Great Books,'' 2005, 
''The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth,'' September 2006, 
''Nature Revealed: Selected Writings'' 1949–2006, 
''The Superorganism: The Beauty, Elegance, and Strangeness of Insect Societies,'' 2009,
''[[Anthill: A Novel]]'' April 2010, 
''Kingdom of Ants: Jose Celestino Mutis and the Dawn of Natural History in the New World'', 2010,
''The Leafcutter Ants: Civilization by Instinct,'' 2011, 
''[[The Social Conquest of Earth]]'', 2012,
''Half-Earth: Our Planet's Fight for Life'', 2016.

He published 3 books in 2014 alone: ''[[Letters to a Young Scientist]]'', 
''A Window on Eternity: A Biologist's Walk Through Gorongosa National Park,'' and
''The Meaning of Human Existence''.

He and his wife Irene reside in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]]. His daughter, Catherine, and her husband Jonathan, reside in nearby [[Stow, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Academy of Achievement" /&gt;

==Work==

===''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis'', 1975===
{{main|Sociobiology: The New Synthesis}}

Wilson used sociobiology and evolutionary principles to explain the behavior of social insects and then to understand the social behavior of other animals, including humans, thus established sociobiology as a new scientific field. He argued that all animal behavior, including that of humans, is the product of [[heredity]], environmental stimuli, and past experiences, and that [[free will]] is an illusion. He has referred to the biological basis of behaviour as the "genetic leash".&lt;ref name=con&gt;E. O. Wilson, Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge, New York, Knopf, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127–128}} The sociobiological view is that all animal social behavior is governed by [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] rules worked out by the laws of [[evolution]]. This theory and research proved to be seminal, controversial, and influential.&lt;ref name=soul&gt;Wolfe, Tom (1996). Sorry, But Your Soul Just Died. Vol. 158, Issue 13, Forbes&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|210ff}}

Wilson has argued that the [[unit of selection]] is a gene, the basic element of heredity. The ''target'' of selection is normally the individual who carries an ensemble of genes of certain kinds. With regard to the use of [[kin selection]] in explaining the behavior of [[Eusociality|eusocial]] [[insects]], the "new view that I'm proposing is that it was [[group selection]] all along, an idea first roughly formulated by Darwin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2006/jun/e-o-wilson |title=Discover Interview: E.O. Wilson |website=DiscoverMagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociobiological research was at the time particularly controversial with regard to its application to humans.&lt;ref name=NYTnov1975&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rensberger|first1=Boyce |title=The Basic Elements of the Arguments Are Not New |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/09/archives/the-basic-elements-of-the-arguments-are-not-new-the-politics-in-a.html?_r=0 |work=The New York Times |date=9 November 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory established a scientific argument for rejecting the common doctrine of [[tabula rasa]], which holds that human beings are born without any innate mental content and that culture functions to increase human knowledge and aid in survival and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Restak|first1=Richard M.|title=Is Our Culture In Our Genes?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/24/books/is-our-culture-in-our-genes.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=2 January 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=24 April 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final chapter of the book ''Sociobiology'' Wilson argues that the human mind is shaped as much by genetic inheritance as it is by culture if not more. There are, Wilson suggests in the chapter, limits on just how much influence social and environmental factors can have in altering human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E. O. ''Sociobiology''. Harvard. Chapter 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reception====
''Sociobiology'' was initially met with substantial criticism. Several of Wilson's colleagues at Harvard,&lt;ref name="grafen75"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think]] |last=Grafen |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Grafen |author2=Ridley, Mark |author2link=Mark Ridley (zoologist)|year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, New York |isbn=0-19-929116-0 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Richard Lewontin]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]], were strongly opposed to his ideas regarding sociobiology. Gould, Lewontin, and others from the [[Sociobiology Study Group]] from the Boston area wrote "Against 'Sociobiology'" in an [[open letter]] criticizing Wilson's "deterministic view of human society and human action".&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Elizabeth, et al. (1975). [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/9017?sess=305fe41afae729849e1e7eb4b004bb81 "Against 'Sociobiology'".] [letter] ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' 22 (Nov. 13): 182, 184–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Although attributed to members of the Sociobiology Study Group, it seems that Lewontin was the main author.&lt;ref name="Edward O. Wilson 2006" /&gt; In a 2011 interview, Wilson said, "I believe Gould was a charlatan. I believe that he was ... seeking reputation and credibility as a scientist and writer, and he did it consistently by distorting what other scientists were saying and devising arguments based upon that distortion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=French |first=Howard |title=E.

[[Marshall Sahlins]]'s 1976 work ''The Use and Abuse of Biology'' was a direct criticism of Wilson's theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Marshall David |last=Sahlins |title=The Use and Abuse of Biology |year=1976 |isbn=0-472-08777-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also political opposition. Sociobiology re-ignited the [[nature and nurture]] debate. Wilson was accused of [[racism]], [[misogyny]], and sympathy to [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Douglas |first=Ed |date=17 February 2001 |title=Darwin's natural heir |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2001/feb/17/books.guardianreview57 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one incident in November 1978, his lecture was attacked by the [[International Committee Against Racism]], a front group of the Marxist [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor Party]], where one member poured a pitcher of water on Wilson's head and chanted "Wilson, you're all wet" at an [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wilson |first=Edward O. |year=1995 |title=Naturalist |isbn=0-446-67199-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson later spoke of the incident as a source of pride: "I believe ... I was the only scientist in modern times to be physically attacked for an idea."&lt;ref name="Nova"&gt;{{cite video |people=David Dugan (writer, producer, director) |date=May 2008 |title=Lord of the Ants |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/eowilson/program.html |medium=Documentary |publisher=NOVA |accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objections from evangelical Christians included those of Paul E. Rothrock in 1987: "... sociobiology has the potential of becoming a religion of scientific materialism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/asa/PSCF/1987/PSCF6-87Rothrock.html Mythology of Scientific Materialism.] Paul E. Rothrock and Mary Ellen Rothrock, PSCF 39 (June 1987): 87-93&lt;/ref&gt;
Philosopher [[Mary Midgley]] encountered ''Sociobiology'' in the process of writing ''Beast and Man'' (1996) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Midgley |first1=Mary |title=Beast and man : the roots of human nature |date=1995 |publisher=Routledge |location=London [u.a.] |isbn=0-415-12740-8 |page=xli |edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and significantly rewrote the book to offer a critique of Wilson's views. Midgley praised the book for the study of animal behavior, clarity, scholarship, and encyclopedic scope, but extensively critiqued Wilson for conceptual confusion, scientism, and anthropomorphism of genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Midgley |first1=Mary |title=Beast and man: the roots of human nature |date=1995 |publisher=Routledge |location=London [u.a.] |isbn=0-415-12740-8 |page=xl |edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book and its reception were mentioned in Jonathan Haidt's book [[The Righteous Mind]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Haidt 2012, p. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''On Human Nature'', 1978===
Wilson wrote in his 1978 book ''[[On Human Nature]]'', "The evolutionary epic is probably the best myth we will ever have." Wilson's use of the word "myth" provides people with meaningful placement in time celebrating shared heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Connie Barlow |title=The Epic of Evolution: Religious and cultural interpretations of modern scientific cosmology |work=Science &amp; Spirit Magazine |url=http://www.science-spirit.org/article_detail.php?article_id=31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523211715/http://science-spirit.org/article_detail.php?article_id=31 |archivedate=2006-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson's fame prompted use of the morphed phrase [[epic of evolution]].&lt;ref name="cnn" /&gt; The book won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Bryan |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/08/30/all-time-100-best-nonfiction-books/slide/on-human-nature-by-edward-o-wilson/ |title=All-TIME 100 Nonfiction Books |date=17 August 2011 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Ants'', 1990===
Wilson, along with [[Bert Hölldobler]], carried out a systematic study of ants and ant behavior,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/science/15wils.html |title=Taking a Cue From Ants on Evolution of Humans |work=The New York Times |author=Nicholas Wade |date=July 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in the 1990 encyclopedic work ''[[The Ants]]''. Because much self-sacrificing behavior on the part of individual ants can be explained on the basis of their genetic interests in the survival of the sisters, with whom they share 75% of their genes (though the actual case is some species' queens mate with multiple males and therefore some workers in a colony would only be 25% related), Wilson argued for a sociobiological explanation for all social behavior on the model of the behavior of the social insects.

Wilson has said in reference to ants "[[Karl Marx]] was right, [[socialism]] works, it is just that he had the wrong species".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E6D71F31F931A25756C0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |title=Scientist at Work: Edward O. Wilson; From Ants to Ethics: A Biologist Dreams Of Unity of Knowledge |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |date=May 12, 1998 |accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He meant that while ants and other [[eusocial]] species appear to live in [[communist]]-like societies, they only do so because they are forced to do so from their basic biology, as they lack reproductive independence: worker ants, being sterile, need their ant-queen in order to survive as a colony and a species, and individual ants cannot reproduce without a queen and are thus forced to live in centralised societies. Humans, however, do possess reproductive independence so they can give birth to offspring without the need of a "queen", and in fact humans enjoy their maximum level of Darwinian fitness only when they look after themselves and their offspring, while finding innovative ways to use the societies they live in for their own benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview |title=Karl Marx was right, socialism works |last=Wilson |first=Edward O. |location=Harvard University |date=March 27, 1997 |url=http://www.froes.dds.nl/WILSON.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Consilience'', 1998===
In his 1998 book ''[[Consilience (book)|Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]]'', Wilson discussed methods that have been used to unite the sciences, and might be able to unite the sciences with the humanities. Wilson used the term "[[consilience]]" to describe the synthesis of knowledge from different specialized fields of human endeavor. He defined [[human nature]] as a collection of [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] rules, the genetic patterns of mental development. He argued that culture and rituals are products, not parts, of human nature. He said [[art]] is not part of human nature, but our appreciation of art is. He suggested that concepts such as art appreciation, fear of snakes, or the [[incest]] [[taboo]] ([[Westermarck effect]]) could be studied by scientific methods of the natural sciences and be part of interdisciplinary research.

The book was mentioned in Jonathan Haidt's book [[The Righteous Mind]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Spiritual and political beliefs==

===Scientific humanism===
Wilson coined the phrase ''[[scientific humanism]]'' as "the only [[worldview]] compatible with science's growing knowledge of the real world and the laws of nature".&lt;ref&gt;in ''Harvard Magazine'' December 2005 p 33.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2015}} Wilson argued that it is best suited to improve the human condition. In 2003, he was one of the signers of the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|''Humanist Manifesto'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers |title=Notable Signers |publisher=American Humanist Association |work=Humanism and Its Aspirations |accessdate=October 6, 2012|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===God and religion===
On the question of [[God]], Wilson has described his position as ''provisional deism''&lt;ref&gt;''The Creation''{{page needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and explicitly denied the label of "[[Atheism|atheist]]", preferring "[[Agnosticism|agnostic]]".&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/new_scientist/2015/02/e_o_wilson_on_the_meaning_of_human_existence_warnings_about_earth_s_future.html |title=Why Do We Ignore Warnings About Earth's Future? |last=Sarchet |first=Penny |date=2015-02-01 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |quote=In fact, I'm not an atheist ... I would even say I'm agnostic}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has explained his faith as a trajectory away from traditional beliefs: "I drifted away from the church, not definitively agnostic or atheistic, just [[Baptist]] &amp; [[Christian]] no more."&lt;ref name=con /&gt; Wilson argues that the belief in God and rituals of religion are products of [[evolutionary origin of religions|evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Human Nature{{page needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that they should not be rejected or dismissed, but further investigated by science to better understand their significance to human nature. In his book ''The Creation'', Wilson suggests that scientists ought to "offer the hand of friendship" to religious leaders and build an alliance with them, stating that "Science and religion are two of the most potent forces on Earth and they should come together to save the creation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/06.15/03-biodiversity.html ''Naturalist E.O. Wilson is optimistic''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324162927/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/06.15/03-biodiversity.html |date=2008-03-24 }} [[Harvard Gazette]] June 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson made an appeal to the religious community on the lecture circuit at Midland College, Texas, for example, and that "the appeal received a 'massive reply'", that a covenant had been written and that a "partnership will work to a substantial degree as time goes on".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mywesttexas.com/articles/2009/09/18/news/top_stories/doc4ab31071978e4063758641.txt ''Scientist says there is hope to save planet''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130129122836/http://www.mywesttexas.com/articles/2009/09/18/news/top_stories/doc4ab31071978e4063758641.txt |date=2013-01-29 }} mywesttexas.com, September 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[New Scientist]]'' interview published on 21 January 2015, Wilson said that "Religion 'is dragging us down' and must be eliminated 'for the sake of human progress{{Single double}}, and "So I would say that for the sake of human progress, the best thing we could possibly do would be to diminish, to the point of eliminating, religious faiths."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/2015/01/famed-biologist-religion-is-dragging-us-down-and-must-be-eliminated-for-the-sake-of-human-progress/ |title=Famed biologist: Religion 'is dragging us down' and must be eliminated 'for the sake of human progress' |website=Rawstory.com |date=2015-01-28 |accessdate=2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22530050-400-e-o-wilson-religious-faith-is-dragging-us-down/|title=E.

===Ecology===
Wilson has said that, if he could start his life over he would work in [[microbial ecology]], when discussing the reinvigoration of his original fields of study since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Edward O. Wilson |date=2008 |title=Lord of the Ants |url=http://documentaryhive.com/lord-of-the-ants/ |format=documentary film |medium=television |publisher=[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA/WGBH]] |location= |accessdate=2009-03-01 |time= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied the [[mass extinction]]s of the 20th century and their relationship to modern society, and in 1998 argued for an [[Ecology|ecological]] approach at the Capitol:

{{quote|Now when you cut a forest, an [[ancient forest]] in particular, you are not just removing a lot of big [[tree]]s and a few [[bird]]s fluttering around in the [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]]. You are drastically imperiling a vast array of [[species]] within a few square miles of you. The number of these species may go to tens of thousands. ... Many of them are still unknown to science, and science has not yet discovered the key role undoubtedly played in the maintenance of that [[ecosystem]], as in the case of [[fungi]], [[microorganism]]s, and many of the [[insect]]s.&lt;ref name="slide2"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Edward Osborne |date=28 April 1998 |url=http://www.saveamericasforests.org/wilson/second.htm |title=Slide show |page=2 |website=saveamericasforests.org |accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wilson has been part of the international [[conservation movement]], as a consultant to Columbia University's [[Earth Institute]], as a director of the American Museum of Natural History, [[Conservation International]], [[The Nature Conservancy]] and the [[World Wildlife Fund]].&lt;ref name="Academy of Achievement"/&gt;

Understanding the scale of the extinction crisis has led him to advocate for forest protection,&lt;ref name="slide2"/&gt; including the "Act to Save America's Forests", first introduced in 1998, until 2008, but never passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saveamericasforests.org/congress/congress.htm |title=Congress - The Act to Save America's Forests |website=Saveamericasforests.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Forests Now Declaration]] calls for new markets-based mechanisms to protect tropical forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalcanopy.org/projects/forests-now-declaration|title=The Forests NOW Declaration {{!}} Global Canopy Programme|website=globalcanopy.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Wilson called for setting aside 50% of the earth's surface for other species to thrive in as the only possible strategy to solve the extinction crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/can-world-really-set-aside-half-planet-wildlife-180952379/?no-ist |title=Can the World Really Set Aside Half of the Planet for Wildlife? &amp;#124; Science &amp;#124; Smithsonian |website=Smithsonianmag.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Environmental Investigation Agency''' ('''EIA''') is a UK-based [[NGO]] founded in 1984 by [[Dave Currey (environmentalist)|Dave Currey]], Jennifer Lonsdale and Allan Thornton, three environmental activists in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;"Green Gumshoes", Sunday Times Mag, 17/6/1990&lt;/ref&gt;

EIA investigates and campaigns against [[environmental crime]] and abuse.

Its undercover investigations expose transnational [[Environmental crime|wildlife crime]], with a focus on [[elephant]]s and [[tiger]]s, and [[forest]] crimes such as [[illegal logging]] and [[deforestation]] for cash crops such as [[palm oil]]. It works to safeguard global marine ecosystems by addressing the threats posed by [[plastic pollution]], [[bycatch]] and commercial exploitation of [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s. Finally, it seeks to reduce the impact of [[climate change]] by campaigning to eliminate powerful refrigerant [[greenhouse gas]]es, exposing related illicit trade and improving [[HVAC|energy efficiency]] in the cooling sector.

EIA uses its findings in hard-hitting reports to campaign for new legislation, improved governance and more effective enforcement. In addition, its field experience is used to provide guidance to enforcement agencies and it also forms partnerships with local groups and activists, support their work through hands-on training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/about-eia|title=About us – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of work ==

===Climate===
EIA's [[Climate]] work aims to tackle the pressing threat of [[climate change]] by eliminating powerful [[greenhouse gas]]es used widely in the cooling sector, improving energy efficiency of replacement technologies and investigating the illicit trade in refrigerant greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/our-work/climate|title=Climate – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key campaign areas include:

* '''[[Montreal Protocol|The Montreal Protocol]]''':  Agreed in 1987 with a pressing mission to regulate the chemicals directly destroying Earth’s [[ozone layer]] and celebrated as the world’s most successful environmental treaty. EIA was instrumental in proposing and then making the case that the Protocol, which so ably removed [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs), was the best mechanism by which to phase out the harmful [[hydrofluorocarbon]]s (HFCs) which have come to replace CFCs. This work resulted in the [[Montreal Protocol|Kigali Amendment]] on HFCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/our-work/climate/montreal-protocol|title=The Montreal Protocol – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''EU F-Gas Regulation''': [[Fluorinated gases]], or F-gases, are a range of greenhouse gases widely used in [[refrigeration]] and [[Air conditioning|air-conditioning]], most notably HFCs. They are governed in the [[European Union]] by the F-Gas Regulation, a mechanism seeking to phase them out in favour of climate-friendly refrigerants. EIA campaigned extensively against industry lobbying to ensure a robust and ambitious revision of the Regulation and continues to work for its effective implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/our-work/climate/f-gas|title=EU F-Gas Regulation – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Energy efficiency''': Rising global temperatures and growing income levels in the developing world are driving a boom in demand for cooling which is highly energy intensive and has a significant negative impact on climate. EIA campaigns to ensure cooling systems are not only HFC-free, but are as efficient as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/our-work/climate/energy-efficiency|title=Energy efficiency – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cooling technologies''': The phase-out of [[hydrochlorofluorocarbons]] (HCFCs) in developing countries and the HFC phase-down in developed countries offers opportunities to adopt energy efficient climate-friendly alternatives. EIA campaigns to spread awareness of these alternatives and their multiple benefits, giving end users the choices they need to make informed decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/our-work/climate/cooling-technologies|title=Cooling technologies – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In partnership with [[Greenpeace]], EIA has created the [http://www.cooltechnologies.org/ Cool Technologies website].

=== Forests ===
EIA's Forests work aims to reduce global [[deforestation]] by advocating improved governance and trade laws, revealing the negative impacts of cash crops such as [[palm oil]] and exposing key criminal players in the transnational illegal trade in stolen timber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/our-work/forests|title=Forests – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key campaign areas include:

* '''Timber''': Deforestation in [[Asia]] through illegal logging and forest conversion to cash-crop plantations is a major crisis, overseen by large international companies or transnational criminal gangs. Working with partners and civil society on the ground, EIA's investigations expose the criminals, the illegal timber flows and the [[corruption]] which facilitates forest crime, using international laws to press for action and further reduce the scale of deforestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/our-work/forests/timber|title=Timber – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Palm oil''': Palm oil is a vegetable oil found in literally thousands of products ranging from soaps and cosmetics to countless foodstuffs including chocolates, cereals, dairy products and crisps. Its popularity is due to its comparatively low cost to produce and ready availability – but palm oil production is widely linked to deforestation, [[illegal logging]], [[Human rights|human rights abuses]] and [[biodiversity]] loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/our-work/forests/palm-oil|title=Palm oil – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Rights''': Illegal logging and destructive [[Land development|forest conversion]] are directly connected to corruption and crime, [[cronyism]], curbs on [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and accountability, selective law enforcement, elitist land tenure and compromised judiciaries, and often involve state officials and security apparatus. Limited [[civil society]] participation exacerbates these problems. EIA’s groundbreaking forest investigations and lobbying have consistently uncovered serious failings in forest governance, forcing governments and industry to acknowledge the problems and address them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/our-work/forests/rights|title=Rights – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EIA's [[Ocean]] work aims to improve the status of marine wildlife and ecosystems by reducing threats posed by [[Marine debris|marine plastic pollution]], [[bycatch]] and commercial exploitation of [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/our-work/ocean|title=Ocean – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key campaign areas include:

* '''Plastic pollution''': Marine [[plastic pollution]] is one of the most serious emerging threats to the health of oceans and a major hazard to marine biodiversity. EIA has worked on the issue at the UK level and internationally, campaigning both alone and in partnerships against single-use plastics such as supermarket [[Plastic shopping bag|carrier bags]], [[microbead]]s in rinse-off products and other forms of damaging plastic packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/our-work/ocean/plastic-pollution|title=Plastic pollution – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Vaquita and totoaba''': Fewer than 30 [[vaquita]] porpoises are believed to be left on the planet, making it the world’s most endangered marine mammal – its extinction is imminent unless significant steps are taken to protect it. The vaquita is not hunted in its own right but is dying in illegal [[Gillnetting|gill nets]] set for the [[totoaba]] fish, an endangered species whose dried swim bladder is prized in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/our-work/ocean/vaquita-totoaba|title=Vaquita and totoaba – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Whales, dolphins and porpoises''': The international moratorium on [[Whaling|commercial whaling]] is one of the greatest conservation successes of the 20th century but some countries have defied it to continue the practice. EIA campaigns to keep the ban in place, to expose the exploitation of those species it does not cover and to drive action to address other threats to whales, dolphins and porpoises such plastic, chemical and noise pollution as well as industrial-scale fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/our-work/ocean/whales-dolphins-porpoises|title=Whales, dolphins and porpoises – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wildlife ===
EIA's Wildlife work aims to reduce wildlife crime around the world, advocating the dismantling of transnational criminal networks involved in illegal trade, pressing for better legislation and the closure of key markets, advocating improved enforcement techniques and exposing transnational organised criminal networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/our-work/wildlife|title=Wildlife – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key campaign areas include:

* '''[[Elephant]]s''': [[Ivory]] trade is the main culprit responsible for the catastrophic levels of elephant [[poaching]]. For many years, EIA's investigations have consistently revealed the extent of the problem, identifying the transnational criminal groups behind the trafficking of illegal ivory and the corruption they help drive, and have played a major role on shutting down ivory trade. It also continues to work for the closure of all domestic and international ivory markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/our-work/wildlife/elephants|title=Elephants – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Tiger]]s''': EIA works for the recovery of wild tiger populations by advocating the dismantling of transnational criminal networks involved in [[illegal trade]], such as the production of [[tiger bone wine]] pressing for better legislation and the protection of their habitat and exposing the role of tiger farming in both illegal and legal trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/our-work/wildlife/tigers|title=Tigers – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Wildlife trade maps''': EIA has created a series of interactive maps documenting the illegal trade in certain wildlife species as an open resource to learn more about wildlife crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eia-international.org/our-work/wildlife/maps|title=Trade Maps – EIA International|work=EIA International|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animal Detectives TV Series ==

In 1995, Independent Television Network ([[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]) broadcast a TV series called The Animal Detectives in the UK.  The series commissioned by Carlton Television was produced by Goldhawk together with Ecodetectives, a company owned by directors of EIA.  The series, based on EIA's undercover investigation work into the trade in endangered species, showed footage from EIA's undercover filming.  The series had seven episodes, each covering a different group of animals-

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4270">[[File:Campo12Foto 2.JPG|thumb|Aerial view of the Amazon rainforest]]
The '''flying river''' is a movement of large quantities of [[water vapor]] transported in the atmosphere from the [[Amazon Basin]] to other parts of South America. The forest trees release water vapor into the atmosphere through [[transpiration]] and this moisture is deposited in other localities in the form of [[precipitation]], forming a virtual river.

==Concept==
An average forest tree will release 1000 litres (220&amp;nbsp;imp&amp;nbsp;gal; 264&amp;nbsp;US&amp;nbsp;gal) of water vapor into the atmosphere every day.&lt;ref name=Marull/&gt; It has been found that whereas every square metre of the surface of the sea evaporates one litre of water each day, the same area of forest evaporates about eight times as much because of the multiple layers of foliage in the [[Crown (botany)|crown]] of the trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planetasustentavel.abril.com.br/noticia/ambiente/rios-voadores-todo-vapor-agua-amazonia-2010-541534.shtml |title=Rios voadores a todo vapor |author=Thays Prado |date=2010-03-18 |publisher=Planeta Sustentável |language=Spanish |accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main airflow in the Amazon basin is towards the southwest. When this air mass reaches the Andes, the mountain range acts as a "natural barrier", redirecting huge volumes of humid air towards central and southern Brazil as well as towards northern Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, and rain falls in these areas. Some part of this air manages to surmount the [[cordillera]] and deposits rain in Peru. Other air masses travel northwards from the Amazon basin, passing over Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, French Guiana, and Suriname.&lt;ref name=Marull&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phys.org/news/2012-09-amazon-vapor-rivers-brazil.html |title=Amazon's flying water vapor rivers bring rain to Brazil |author=Yana Marull |date=2012-09-18 |publisher=Phys.org |accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climatic consequences of deforestation==
[[File:Mato Grosso deforestation (Pedro Biondi) 12ago2007.jpg|thumb|left|Deforestation in [[Mato Grosso]] state]]
In 2009 Antonio Nobre, a Brazilian climate scientist, stated that without the flying river, much of southern Brazil, which produces approximately 70% of the country's [[Gross national product|GNP]], would be arid desert. Clearing the Amazon forest for logging and agriculture is likely to result in lower yields elsewhere. Smoke from the fires set by some farmers to clear land sends particles into the atmosphere, resulting in diminished precipitation, which in turn leaves the trees, which have evolved in wet conditions, vulnerable to fire. The [[drought]] in southern Brazil in 2010 is believed to be due to the drying up of the flying rivers, and the [[2015 Brazilian drought|even worse 2014-5 drought]] is also attributed to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Drought bites as Amazon's 'flying rivers' dry up |author=Rocha, Jan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/15/drought-bites-as-amazons-flying-rivers-dry-up |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2014-09-15 |accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flying Rivers Project==
With its large surface area and abundant rainfall, Brazil receives more rain in a year (estimated at {{convert|15000|km3}}) than any other country.&lt;ref name=Project/&gt; In 2007, the Swiss-Brazilian pilot [[Gérard Moss]] joined with scientists to initiate a project to evaluate the source of the atmospheric water over Brazil and examine the possibility that recent droughts in the country are being caused by the [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest]]. This is the Flying Rivers Project. The primary objective of the project is to "try to ascertain the origin of the water vapour, rainwater and river water in the areas crossed by the flying rivers". Other objectives are to scientifically evaluate the processes involved in this water transfer and to educate the public in understanding the importance of the Amazon rainforest as a source of the water that is vital for their lives and the economy.&lt;ref name=Project&gt;{{cite web |url=http://riosvoadores.com.br/english/ |title=The Flying Rivers Project |work=Expedicao Rios Voadores |accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denmark]] is a [[Nordic country]] located in [[Northern Europe]]. It consists of the [[Jutland]] peninsula and several islands in the [[Baltic sea]], referred to as the [[List of islands of Denmark|Danish Archipelago]]. Denmark is located southwest of Sweden and due south of Norway and is bordered by the German state (and former possession) [[Schleswig-Holstein]] to the south, on Denmark's only land border, 68 kilometres (42 miles) long.

Denmark borders both the Baltic and [[North Sea]]s along its {{convert|8,750|km|mi|abbr=on}} tidal shoreline. Denmark's general coastline is much shorter, at {{convert|1,701|km|mi|abbr=on}}, as it would not include most of the 1,419 offshore islands (each defined as exceeding 100 square meters in area) and the 180&amp;nbsp;km long [[Limfjorden]], which separates Denmark's second largest island, [[North Jutlandic Island]], 4,686&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size, from the rest of Jutland.  No location in Denmark is further from the coast than {{convert|52|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. The size of the land area of Denmark cannot be stated exactly since the ocean constantly erodes and adds material to the coastline, and because of human [[land reclamation]] projects (to counter erosion). On the southwest coast of Jutland, the tide is between {{convert|1|and|2|m|ft|2|abbr=on}}, and the tideline moves outward and inward on a {{convert|10|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} stretch.&lt;ref&gt;Nationalencyklopedin, (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

A circle enclosing the same area as Denmark would be 742&amp;nbsp;km (461 miles) long. Denmark has 443 named islands (1,419 islands above 100&amp;nbsp;m²),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.kms.dk/C1256AED004EA666/(AllDocsByDocId)/1D7EE8822587E667C1256AEF0030ABF6?open&amp;page=strste&amp;omr=KORT_DK_I_TAL Islands in total and named islands]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 72 are inhabited ({{as of|2007|01|01|lc=on}}, Statistics Denmark). The largest islands are [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] ''(Sjælland)'' and [[Funen]] ''(Fyn)''. The island of [[Bornholm]] is located east of the rest of the country, in the [[Baltic Sea]]. Many of the larger islands are connected by bridges; the [[Øresund Bridge]] connects Zealand with Sweden; the [[Great Belt Fixed Link|Great Belt Bridge]] connects Funen with Zealand; and the [[Little Belt Bridge (1970)|Little Belt Bridge]] connects Jutland with Funen. [[Ferry|Ferries]] or [[small aircraft]] connect to the smaller islands. Main cities are the capital [[Copenhagen]] on Zealand; [[Aarhus|Århus]], [[Aalborg]] and [[Esbjerg]] in Jutland; and [[Odense]] on Funen.

Denmark experiences a temperate climate. This means that the winters are mild and windy and the summers are cool. The local terrain is generally flat with a few gently rolling [[plain]]s. The territory of Denmark includes the island of [[Bornholm]] in the Baltic Sea and the rest of metropolitan Denmark, but excludes the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Greenland]]. Its position gives Denmark complete control of the [[Danish Straits]] ([[Skagerrak]] and [[Kattegat]]) linking the Baltic and North Seas. The country's natural resources include [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[fish]], [[salt]], [[limestone]], [[chalk]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[gravel]] and [[sand]].

=== Agriculture ===

* Denmark has plenty of rain, flat landscape, and moderate climate. With 55.99% of its land considered as arable, Denmark has model characteristics for agriculture. 61% of the country’s total area is cultivated &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://agricultureandfood.dk/|title=FACTS AND FIGURES: Danish Agriculture and Food|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farms in Denmark are remarkably large, averaging 172.9 acres per farm. Additionally, homesteads exceeding 247 acres make up more than 20% in Denmark. Many of these large farms harvest fruits and vegetables, the leading exports from Denmark are meat, fur, and dairy products. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The animal’s diet in Denmark consist of mainly cereals since it is the dominated field crop. 75% of all cereal produced in Denmark is feed to the four most produced animals which are pigs, cattle, chicken and mink. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Denmark overproduces about 66% of food production compared to their own population size (5.7 million) being that they are able to feed 15 million people. This is a byproduct of being highly productive within the Danish agricultural production. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* In 1961, Denmark's Agricultural land represented 74.5% of land area. Fifty-six years later to 2015, Denmark has decreased its amount of Agricultural land down to 62.1%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.AGRI.ZS?locations=DK|title=Agricultural land (% of land area) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; then to 61% one year later in reference to "Facts and Figures - Danish Agriculture and Food"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://agricultureandfood.dk/|title=FACTS AND FIGURES: Danish Agriculture and Food|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The decrease in agricultural land comes as farmers are being well educated and the intensive amount of research and development is being implemented. It begins with advancements in agro-technology. The results have improved fertilization and nutrient use on arable land. Digestibility and nutrient uptake are developing from the improvements of new methods that are being implemented. Examples of these new methods are the addition of enzymes and microbial cultures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Population==

* Denmark has a population of 5,605,947 as of July 2017. The country currently has a birth rate of 10.5 per thousand and a death rate of 10.3 per thousand. The average life expectancy is 79.5 years, with males living on average for 77.1 years, and females for 82.1 years. The migrant rate is 2.1 per thousand.

==== Urban Population/Density  ====

*Denmark's urban population accounts for 87.9% of its total population, with a 0.51% rate of change in urbanization.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/da.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copenhagen remains the largest city in Denmark with a population of 1.2 million people and a metro population of 1.99 million. Copenhagen became Denmark's Capital in 1443 and now currently sits with a population density of 6,800 people per square kilometer.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/denmark-population/|title=Denmark Population 2018 (Demographics, Maps, Graphs)|website=worldpopulationreview.com|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.visitdenmark.com/copenhagen/culture/brief-history-copenhagen|title=A brief history of Copenhagen|work=VisitDenmark|access-date=2018-10-31|language=ln-int}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*About a quarter of Danes live in the capital [[Copenhagen]]. 

== Transportation  ==

=== Modes and Intermodalism ===

* Bicycling is a huge part of Dane lives, it has become one of the primary forms of transportation. Even during all four seasons of the year, Danes will cycle through any weather e.g. Sunshine, rain, hail and snow. Bikes have become a part of a Dane’s life since larger Danish cities have built infrastructure to support a network of bicycle lanes. To better apprehend the importance of the bike, 9 out of 10 Danes own a bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://denmark.dk/people-and-culture/biking|title=A nation of cyclists|work=Denmark.dk|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being that bicycling is a big part of Dane lives, the Capital Region of Denmark has aspired in becoming the leading cycle region in the world. They believe this is possible by investing in infrastructure that will accommodate a dramatic change from gas vehicles to bicycles.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cycling-embassy.dk/2018/09/28/it-pays-off-to-invest-cycle-superhighways/|title=Cycle superhighways Capital Region of Denmark|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Cycling Embassy of Denmark|page=http://www.cyclingembassy.dk/wpcontent/uploads/2018/09/Cycle-superhighways_2018.pdf|others=|url-access=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2012 Denmark had established 17 km of cycle superhighways. In 2018, superhighways for cycling now account for 167 km. Denmark envisions to build 45 routes that amount to a total of 746 km. It is estimated that by 2045, all infrastructure in connection with the superhighways for cycling will cost an estimated 295 million euros. Once complete, a socio-economic analysis shows that Denmark can achieve a socio-economic surplus of 765 million euros. This takes into account not enduring 40,000 days of sick leave that is used annually, a decrease in mortality of about 30% for adults who bike 7 days a week, 1 million less car trips taken annually.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Public/Private Dimensions ===

* The Storebælt bridge was built by A/S Storbælte (Public sector company) and opened for motor vehicles on 1998 and the railway was opened a year before that. The total cost of construction was set at DKK 21.4 billion back in the late 80s. The bridge consists of two bridges connecting both the eastern and western side of Denmark. A/S Storbælte managed to cover the total costs of the bridge by raising loans in Danish and international capital markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.storebaelt.dk/english/bridge|title=Facts and history|work=Storebælt|access-date=2018-12-01|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sundogbaelt.dk/en/as-storebaelt/|title=A/S Storebælt|work=Sund og Bælt|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; There lies a strong spatial connection between public financing of the bridge and economic and social outcomes when referencing the Storebælt bridge. Since its opening in 1997 to 2013, traffic though the bridge has increased to a substantial 171 percent. In an analysis published by Denmark’s Ministry of Transport and Sund &amp; Bælt in the year 2014, Denmark is set to directly benefit from it over the course of 50 years. DDK 379 billion will account for this 50 year term, amounting to DDK 9 billion each year. The bridge overall has made spatial processes across Denmark easier for the Danish people. This makes it the best Danish transport investment ever for their society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sundogbaelt.dk/en/storebaelt-fixed-links-economic-importance/|title=Storebælt fixed link’s economic importance|work=Sund og Bælt|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Geography ==

=== Midsummer festival of Saint Hans ===

* Denmark celebrates Sankt Hans (John the Baptist) on the evening of 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of June. The festival was founded on pagan traditions before Denmark embarked on Christianity. Family and friends begin to celebrate this day with dinner at home with loved ones. The iconic bonfires are commonly by the coast line or on the bank of a lake. It is tradition for a witch like figure to be burning on top of the bonfire. The witch figure burns as the community signs “[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojqvlQQBPE8 Midsommervisen]” written by Holger Drachmann (Danish Poet) during the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://denmark.dk/people-and-culture/danish-traditions|title=Danish holidays and traditions|work=Denmark.dk|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Danish people reminisce on their dark times. An estimated one thousand people (men and women) were convicted of sorcery and were sentenced to death by fire in Denmark during the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.dk/20150623/denmark-sankt-hans-aften|title=Denmark's Sankt Hans Aften explained: Witches and rain|date=2015-06-23|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christmas: The highlight of the long Danish winter ===

* During mid-December is when Denmark experiences long nights. The sun rising at 9 am and it then sets at 4 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fyidenmark.com/weather_in_denmark.html|title=Weather in Denmark|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 958 AD, the Viking era was a time when people living in the Scandinavian area would celebrate during this time to bring in a brighter and joyful time. Once Christianity was popularized, Danish people began naming the celebration during these darken times “Christmas.”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Christmas in Denmark is celebrated on the 24&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of December. During this time, the country promotes family time by virtually shutting down all stores and services (even city buses) from 5:30 pm to 10 pm. The traditional dinners Danish people have during Christmas are roast duck, roast pork, or roast goose. One traditional dessert during Christmas in Denmark is ''ris-a-la-mande'' (rice pudding) with hot cherry sauce. &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== New Year's Eve in Denmark ===

* One of Denmark's most celebrated traditions is a televised speech from the Queen on New Year's Eve. The New Year's Speech has been a reoccurring event since 1941, when King Christian X gave the first radio-broadcast speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kongehuset.dk/en/the-monarchy-in-denmark/hm-the-queens-new-year-address|title=HM The Queen's New Year Address|date=2016-04-06|work=The Danish Monarchy - Front Page|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like traditional New Year celebration in many countries, fireworks being ignited is common after the count down. Though before the fireworks, Danes begin the new year by jumping off furniture (chair or sofa) and leap towards the new year right after the clock strikes 12.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

[[File:Republica del Guayra.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map the modern [[Paraná (state)|state of Paraná]] showing the Guayrá region in brown, [[Jesuit Reductions|Jesuit misions]] are marked with crosses and Spaniahs cities with triangles.]]
'''Guayrá''' was a historical region of the [[Spanish Empire]], located in the [[Governorate of the Río de la Plata]], within the colonial [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. The region is located in present-day [[Paraguay]] and [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]].

There are some conflicting etymologies for the origin of the name, with some claiming it was named after a [[cacique]] of the region whose name was Guayrá or Guayracá. Alternatively, the word might come from Guarani "kwa y ra" ("can not pass", "impassable") or even "guay ra" ("river that goes [beyond]").

==Geography==
The limits of Guayrá were the [[Iguazu River]] on the south, the [[Paraná River]] on the west, the [[Tiete River|Tiete]] (or Añemby) River to the north, and the line of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] to the east. The Tiete also marked the boundary between the [[Tupi people|Tupi]] and [[Guarani people|Guarani]] Indians.

[[Aleixo Garcia]] crossed the region in 1522. In 1542, [[Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca]] travelled through its southern reaches on his way to [[Asunción]] from [[Santa Catarina Island]].

==History==
The town of [[Ontiveros,Brazil|Ontiveros]] was founded by [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]] Garcia Rodriguez de Vergara on orders from [[Domingo Martínez de Irala]] in 1554. It was located on the left bank of the Paraná, between the Iguazu and Pipiri-Guazu, about {{convert|50|km|abbr=off}} north of [[Salto del Guairá]], in the territory of the cacique Canendiyu. It was intended to serve as a connection to Portuguese [[Colonial Brazil]].

Ciudad Real del Guayrá, also referred to as Guayrá and the present day [[Guaíra, Paraná]], was founded by Captain [[Ruy Diaz Melgarejo]] in 1556. It is on the left bank of the Paraná at the confluence of the Pipiry-Guazu.

Guayrá was covered with dense forest and many rivers, and by 1600, it had become a place of refuge for the Guarani from the ''[[encomenderos]]'' of Paraguay and the ''esclavistas'' of Brazil.

===Missions of the Guaranis===
It was the main region occupied by the Spanish [[Jesuit reductions]] of the indigenous peoples, at the {{C|Jesuit Missions of the Guaranis}}. However, it was destroyed by the [[bandeirantes]] from [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] in 1631.

Currently for Australia, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[states and territories of Australia|6 states and 2 territories]]. Lesser territories that are under the administration of the commonwealth government, such as the [[Jervis Bay Territory]], the [[Ashmore and Cartier Islands]], and the [[Coral Sea Islands]], are not listed.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|AU}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Australia. The second part is two or three letters, which is the conventional abbreviation of the state or territory (defined in Australian Standard AS 4212-1994).

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

An '''inclusive business''' is a [[sustainable business]] that benefits [[low-income]] communities. It is a business initiative that, keeping its for-profit nature, contributes to poverty reduction through the inclusion of low income communities in its value chain. In simple words inclusive business is all about including the poor in the business process be it as producers or consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bhaskar-chakravorti/how-mark-zuckerberg-can-r_b_9990080.html|title=How Mark Zuckerberg Can Resolve The Inclusive Innovator's Dilemma|date=2016-05-16|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eco-business.com/opinion/inclusive-growth-needs-inclusive-business/|title=Inclusive growth needs inclusive business|last=Eco-Business|website=Eco-Business|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Inclusive businesses find profitable ways to engage the low-income segment into their business operations in a way that benefits the low-income communities and creates sustainable livelihoods. This can include directly employing low-income people, targeting development of suppliers and service providers from low-income communities and providing affordable goods and services targeted at low-income communities. Professor [[Ted London]] at the [[William Davidson Institute]] and [[Ross School of Business]] ([[University of Michigan]]) is a leading expert within the realm of inclusive business, specifically within the international emerging markets realm, and focuses his research and teaching on business strategies, tools and frameworks that can be used when engaging in business initiatives at the [[Bottom of the pyramid|Base of the Pyramid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdi.umich.edu/the-base-of-the-pyramid-promise-building-business-with-impact-and-scale/ Base of the Pyramid Promise]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Italian Renaissance garden''' was a new style of garden which emerged in the late 15th century at villas in [[Rome]] and [[Florence]], inspired by classical ideals of order and beauty, and intended for the pleasure of the view of the garden and the landscape beyond, for contemplation, and for the enjoyment of the sights, sounds and smells of the garden itself.

In the late [[Renaissance]], the gardens became larger, grander and more symmetrical, and were filled with fountains, statues, [[grotto]]es, [[water organ]]s and other features designed to delight their owners and amuse and impress visitors. The style was imitated throughout [[Europe]], influencing the [[gardens of the French Renaissance]] and the [[English garden]].

== The classical influence on the Italian Renaissance garden ==
[[File:Villa d Este1.jpg|left|thumb|The ''Fontana dell'Ovato'' ("Oval Fountain") at the [[Villa d'Este]] at Tivoli (1572)]]
[[File:Villa garzoni 3.jpg|thumb|left|Gardens of Villa Garzoni]]
Prior to the [[Italian Renaissance]], Italian Medieval gardens were enclosed by walls, and were devoted to growing vegetables, fruits and medicinal herbs, or, in the case of monastery gardens, for silent meditation and prayer. The Italian Renaissance garden broke down the wall between the garden, the house, and the landscape outside.&lt;ref&gt;Prevot, Philippe. ''Histoire des Jardins,'' Editions Sud-Ouest, Bordeaux, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian Renaissance garden, like [[Renaissance art]] and [[Renaissance architecture|architecture]], emerged from the rediscovery by Renaissance scholars of classical Roman models. They were inspired by the descriptions of ancient [[Roman gardens]] given by [[Ovid]] in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]''; by the letters of [[Pliny the Younger]], by [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]''; and in ''Rerum Rusticanum'' by [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], all of which gave detailed and lyrical description of the gardens of [[Roman villa]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, Helen. ''Italian Gardens - A Cultural History'', 2006: 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pliny the Younger described his life at his villa at Laurentum: " ...a good life and a genuine one, which is happy and honourable, more rewarding than any "business" can be. You should take the first opportunity to leave the din, the futile bustle and useless occupations of the city and devote yourself to literature or to leisure."&lt;ref name="attlee13"&gt;Cited in Attlee, 2006: 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of a garden, according to Pliny, was "[[otium]]," which could be translated as seclusion, serenity, or relaxation, which was the opposite of the idea of  "negotium" that often classified busy urban life. A garden was a place to think, relax, and escape.&lt;ref name="attlee13"/&gt;

Pliny described shaded paths bordered with hedges, ornamental [[parterre]]s, fountains, and trees and bushes trimmed to geometric or fantastic shapes; all features which would become part of the future Renaissance garden.&lt;ref&gt;Allain and Christiany, L'Art des jardins en Europe, Paris, 2006: 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alberti and the principles of the Renaissance Garden ==
The first Renaissance text to include garden design was ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'' ('The Ten Books of Architecture'), by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472). He drew upon the architectural principles of [[Vitruvius]],&lt;ref&gt;Prevot, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and used quotations from [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Pliny the Younger]] to describe what a garden should look like and how it should be used. He argued that a villa should both be looked at and a place to look from; that the house should be placed above the garden, where it could be seen and the owner could look down into the garden.&lt;ref name="attlee13"/&gt;
{{Renaissance}}
Alberti wrote: "The construction will give pleasure to the visitor if, when they leave the city, they see the villa in all its charm, as if to seduce and welcome the new arrivals. Toward this end, I would place it on a slightly elevated place. I would also have the road climb so gently that it fools those who take it to the point that they do not realize how high they have climbed until they discover the countryside below."&lt;ref  name="alberti"&gt;Alberti, Leon Battista. ''Édifices destinés aux catégories particulières de citoyens, in L'art d'édifier'', translated from the Latin by Pierre Caye and Françoise Choay, Book I, Paris, 2004: 429.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the garden, Alberti wrote: "...You should place [[portico]]s for giving shade, planters where vines can climb, placed on marble columns; vases and amusing statues, provided they are not obscene. You should also have rare plants.... Trees should be aligned and arranged evenly, each tree aligned with its neighbours."&lt;ref name="alberti"/&gt;

== The literary influence on the Italian Renaissance Garden ==
[[File:Appennino2.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Apennine Colossus'' by Giambologna in the gardens of [[Villa di Pratolino]], about 1580]]
A popular romance, ''The [[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]],'' (''Poliphilo's Strife of Love in a Dream''), published in 1499 in [[Venice]] by the monk [[Francesco Colonna]], also had an important influence on the gardens of the Renaissance. It described the voyage and adventures of a traveller, Poliphile, through fantastic landscapes, looking for his love, Polia. The scenes described in the book and the accompanying [[woodcut]] illustrations influenced many Renaissance gardens; they included a lake-island (as at the [[Boboli Gardens]]), giants emerging from the earth (as at [[Villa di Pratolino]]), the [[labyrinth]], and the fountain of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] (as at [[Villa di Castello]]) where Poliphile and Polia were reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;See Prevot,2005; Allain and Christiany, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power and magnificence - the political symbolism of the Renaissance garden==
While the early Italian Renaissance gardens were designed for contemplation and pleasure with tunnels of greenery, trees for shade, an enclosed '' giardino segreto'' (secret garden) and fields for games and amusements, the [[House of Medici|Medici]], the ruling dynasty of Florence, used gardens to demonstrate their own power and [[Magnificence (history of ideas)|magnificence]]. "During the first half of the sixteenth century, magnificence came to be perceived as a princely virtue, and all over the Italian peninsula architects, sculptors, painters, poets, historians and humanist scholars were commissioned to concoct a magnificent image for their powerful patrons."&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 28&lt;/ref&gt; The central fountain at Villa di Castello featured a statue of [[Hercules]] defeating [[Antaeus]], alluding to the triumph of the garden's builder, [[Cosimo de' Medici]]. over a faction of Florentine nobles who had tried to overthrow him. &lt;ref&gt; Isabella Ballerini, ''The Medici Villas: The Complete Guide,'' p. 33 &lt;/ref&gt; The garden was a form of political theater, presenting the power, wisdom, order, beauty and glory that the Medici had brought to Florence.

== Glossary of the Italian Renaissance Garden ==
* '''fontaniere'''. The fountain-maker, a hydraulic engineer who designed the water system and fountains.
* '''giochi d'acqua'''. water tricks. Concealed fountains which drenched unsuspecting visitors.
* '''Sacro Bosco'''. Sacred wood. A grove of trees inspired by the groves where pagans would worship. In Renaissance and especially [[mannerism|mannerist]] gardens, this section was filled with allegorical statues of animals, giants and fantastic creatures.
* '''Giardino Segreto'''. The Secret Garden. An enclosed private garden within the garden, inspired by the cloisters of Medieval monasteries. A place for reading, writing or quiet conversations.
* '''Semplici'''. "Simples," or medicinal plants and herbs.

== Gardens of the Early Italian Renaissance ==
=== The Medici Villa at Fiesole (1455-1461) ===
[[File:Villa Medici a Fiesole 1.jpg|thumb|Villa Medici in Fiesole.]]
The oldest existing Italian Renaissance garden is at the [[Villa Medici in Fiesole]], north of Florence. It was created sometime between 1455 and 1461 by [[Giovanni de' Medici (1421–1463)]] the son of [[Cosimo de' Medici]], the founder of the Medici dynasty. Unlike other [[Medici villas|Medici family villas]] that were located on flat farmland, this villa was located on a rocky hillside with a view over Florence.

The Villa Medici followed Alberti's precepts that a villa should have a view 'that overlooks the city, the owner's land, the sea or a great plain, and familiar hills and mountains,' and that the foreground have 'the delicacy of gardens.'&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Attlee, 2006: 14&lt;/ref&gt; The garden has two large terraces, one at the ground floor level and the other at the level of the first floor. From the reception rooms on the first floor, guests could go out to the [[loggia]] and from there to the garden so the loggia was a transition space connecting the interior with the exterior. Unlike later gardens, the Villa Medici did not have a grand staircase or other feature to link the two levels.

The garden was inherited by his nephew, [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], who made it a meeting place for poets, artists, writers and philosophers. In 1479, the poet [[Poliziano|Angelo Poliziano]], tutor to the Medici children, described the garden in a letter: "..Seated between the sloping sides of the mountains we have here water in abundance and being constantly refreshed with moderate winds find little inconvenience from the glare of the sun. As you approach the house it seems embosomed in the wood, but when you reach it you find it commands a full prospect of the city."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Attlee, 2006: 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Palazzo Piccolomini at Pienza, Tuscany (1459)===
[[File:Piccolomini Gardens.JPG|thumb|Gardens of the Palazzo Piccolomini]]
The [[Pienza#Palazzo Piccolomini|Palazzo Piccolomini]] at [[Pienza]], was built by Enea Silvio Piccolomini, who was Pope from 1458 to 1464, under the name of [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]]. He was a scholar of [[Latin]] and wrote extensively on education, astronomy and social culture.&lt;ref&gt;Allain and Christiany, 2006: 138&lt;/ref&gt; In 1459, he constructed a palace for himself and his Cardinals and court in his small native town of Pienza. Like the Villa Medici, a major feature of the house was the commanding view to be had from the loggia over the valley, the [[Val d'Orcia]], to the slopes of [[Mount Amiata]]. Closer to the house, there were terraces with geometric flowerbeds surrounding fountains and ornamented with bushes trimmed into cones and spheres similar to the garden of Pliny described in Alberti's ''De Re Aedificatoria''.&lt;ref&gt;Allain and Christiany, 2006: 140.&lt;/ref&gt; The garden was designed to open to the town, the palace and the view.

===The Cortile del Belvedere in the Vatican Palace, Rome (1504-1513)===
{{Main|Cortile del Belvedere}}
In 1504, [[Pope Julius II]] commissioned the architect [[Donato Bramante]] to recreate a classical Roman pleasure garden in the space between the old papal [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] palace in Rome and the nearby Villa Belvedere. His model was the ancient sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia at [[Palestrina]] or ancient Praeneste, and he used the classical ideals of proportion, symmetry and perspective in his design. He created a central axis to link the two buildings, and a series of terraces connected by double ramps, modelled after those at Palestrina. The terraces were divided into squares and rectangles by paths and flowerbeds, and served as an outdoor setting for Pope Julius's extraordinary collection of classical sculpture, which included the famous [[Laocoön]] and the [[Apollo Belvedere]]. The heart of the garden was a courtyard surrounded by a three-tiered loggia, which served as a theater for entertainments. A central [[exedra]] formed the dramatic conclusion of the long perspective up the courtyard, ramps and terraces.&lt;ref name="attlee21"/&gt;

The Venetian Ambassador described the [[Cortile del Belvedere]] in 1523: "One enters a very beautiful garden, of which half is filled with growing grass and bays and mulberries and cypresses, while the other half is paved with squares of bricks laid upright, and in every square a beautiful orange tree grows out of the pavement, of which there are a great many, arranged in perfect order....On one side of the garden is a most beautiful loggia, at one end of which is a lovely fountain that irrigates the orange trees and the rest of the garden by a little canal in the center of the loggia."&lt;ref name="attlee21"&gt;Cited in Attlee, 2006: 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the construction of the [[Vatican Library]] in the late 16th century across the centre of the ''cortile'' means that Bramante's design is now obscured but his ideas of proportion, symmetry and dramatic perspectives were used in many of the great gardens of the Italian Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 22&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Villa Madama, Rome (1516)===
[[File:Roma Villa Madama.jpg|thumb|Villa Madama (1516)]]
The [[Villa Madama]], situated on the slopes of [[Monte Mario]] and overlooking Rome, was begun by [[Pope Leo X]] and continued by Cardinal [[Pope Clement VII|Giulio de' Medici]] (1478–1534). In 1516 Leo X gave the commission to [[Raphael]] who was at that time the most famous artist in Rome. Using the ancient text of ''De Architectura'' by Vitruvius and the writings of Pliny the Younger, Raphael imagined his own version of an ideal classical villa and garden. His villa had a great circular courtyard, and was divided into a winter apartment and a summer apartment. Passages led from the courtyard to the great loggia from which views could be gained of the garden and Rome. A round tower on the east side was intended as garden room in winter, warmed by the sun coming through glazed windows. The villa overlooked three terraces, one a square, one a circle, and one an oval. The top terrace was to be planted in chestnut trees and firs while the lower terrace was intended for plant beds.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on the Villa Madama stopped in 1520, after the death of Raphael, but was then continued by other artists until 1534. They finished one-half of the villa including half of the circular courtyard, and the northwest loggia that was decorated with [[grotesque]] [[fresco]]es by [[Giulio Romano]] and [[stucco]] by [[Giovanni da Udine]]. Fine surviving features include a fountain of the head of an elephant by Giovanni da Udine and two gigantic stucco figures by [[Bartolommeo Bandinelli|Baccio Bandinelli]] at the entrance of the ''giardino segreto'', the secret garden.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 27&lt;/ref&gt; The villa is now a state guest house for the Government of Italy.

The middle of the 16th century saw the construction by the Medicis and other wealthy families and individuals, of a series of magnificent gardens that followed the principles of Alberti and Bramante; they were usually sited on a hilltop or slopes of a mountain; had a series of symmetrical terraces, one above the other, along a central axis; the house looked over the garden and landscape beyond and it could itself be seen from the bottom of the garden. Developments in hydrology meant that the gardens were equipped with increasingly elaborate and majestic cascades and fountains, and statues which recalled the grandeur of [[Ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Allain and Christiany, 2006: 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Villa di Castello, Tuscany (1538)===
[[Villa di Castello]] was the project of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]], first [[List of rulers of Tuscany|Duke of Tuscany]], begun when he was only seventeen. It was designed by [[Niccolò Tribolo]] who designed two other gardens: the [[Orto Botanico di Firenze|Giardino dei Semplici]] (1545) and the [[Boboli Gardens]] (1550) for Cosimo.

The garden was laid out on a gentle slope between the villa and the hill of [[Monte Morello]]. Tribolo first built a wall across the slope, dividing it into an upper garden filled with orange trees, and a lower garden that was subdivided into garden rooms with walls of hedges, rows of trees and tunnels of citrus trees and cedars. A central axis, articulated by a series of fountains, extended from the villa up to the base of Monte Morello. In this arrangement, the garden had both grand perspectives and enclosed, private spaces

The lower garden had a large marble fountain that was meant to be seen against a backdrop of dark cypresses, with figures of Hercules and [[Antaeus]]. Just above this fountain, in the centre of the garden, was a labyrinth formed by cypress, laurel, myrtle, roses, and box hedges. Concealed in the middle of the labyrinth was another fountain, with a statue of Venus. Around this fountain, Cosimo had bronze pipes installed under the tiles for ''giochi d'acqua'' ("water tricks"), which were concealed conduits which could be turned on with a key to drench unsuspecting guests. Another unusual feature was a [[tree house]] concealed in an ivy-covered oak tree, with a square dining room inside the tree.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 30&lt;/ref&gt;

At the far end of the garden and set against a wall, Tribolo created an elaborate grotto, decorated with mosaics, pebbles, sea shells, imitation stalactites, and niches with groups of statues of domestic and exotic animals and birds, many with real horns, antlers and tusks. The animals symbolized the virtues and accomplishments of past members of Medici family. Water flowed from the beaks, wings and claws of the animals into marble basins below each niche. A gate could close suddenly behind visitors, and they would be soaked by hidden fountains.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Above the grotto, on the hillside, was small wood, or ''bosco'', with a pond in the center. In the pond is a bronze statue of a shivering giant, with cold water running down over his head, which represents either the month of January or the [[Apennine Mountains]].

When the last of the Medicis died in 1737, the garden began to be altered by its new owners, the [[House of Lorraine]]; the labyrinth was demolished and the statue of Venus was moved to the [[Villa La Petraia]]. But long before then, the garden had been described by many ambassadors and foreign visitors and had become famous throughout Europe. Its principles of perspective, proportion and symmetry, its geometric planting beds and rooms with walls of trees and hedges, were adapted in both the gardens of the [[French Renaissance]] and the [[garden à la française]] which followed.&lt;ref&gt;Allain and Christiany, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Villa d'Este at Tivoli (1550-1572)===
The [[Villa d'Este]] at [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] is one of the grandest and best-preserved of the Italian Renaissance gardens. It was created by Cardinal [[Ippolito II d'Este]], son of [[Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Alfonso I d'Este]], the [[List of Dukes of Ferrara and of Modena|Duke of Ferrara]], and [[Lucrezia Borgia]]. He was made a Cardinal at the age of twenty-nine and became governor of Tivoli in 1550. To develop his residence, he took over a former [[Franciscan]] convent, and for the garden he bought the adjoining steep hillside and the valley below. His chosen architect was [[Pirro Ligorio]], who had been carrying out excavations for Ippolito at the nearby ruins of the ancient ''Villa Adriana'', or [[Hadrian's Villa]], the extensive country residence of the [[Roman Emperor]], [[Hadrian]], that had numerous elaborate water features.&lt;ref&gt;Allain and Christiany, 2006: 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ligorio created the garden as a series of terraces descending the steep hillside at the edge of the mountains overlooking the plain of [[Latium]]. The terraces were connected by gates and grand stairways starting from a terrace below the villa and traversing down to the Fountain of Dragons at the foot of the garden. The stairway was crossed by five traversal alleys on the different levels, which were divided into rooms by hedges and trellises covered with vines. At the crossing points of the stairway and the alleys there were pavilions, fruit trees, and aromatic plants. At the top, the promenade used by the Cardinal passed below the villa and led in one direction to the grotto of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], and in the other to the grotto of [[Asclepius]].

The glory of the Villa d'Este was the system of fountains, fed by two aqueducts that Ligorio constructed from the River [[Aniene]]. In the centre of the garden, the alley of one hundred fountains (which actually had two hundred fountains), crossed the hillside, connecting the Oval Fountain with the Fountain of Rome, which was decorated with models of the famous landmarks of Rome. On a lower level, another alley passed by the Fountain of Dragons and joined the Fountain of [[Proserpina]] with the Fountain of the Owl. Still lower, an alley of fishponds connected the Fountain of the Organ to the site of a proposed Fountain of Neptune.&lt;ref&gt;The present Fountain of Neptune was built in 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

Each fountain and path told a story, linking the d'Este family to the legends of Hercules and [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]] or ''Ippolito'', the mythical son of [[Theseus]] and [[Hippolyta]], the Queen of the [[Amazons]]. The central axis led to the Fountain of Dragons, which illustrated one of the [[labours of Hercules]], and three other statues of Hercules were found in the garden. The myth of Ippolito, the mythical namesake of the owner, was illustrated by two grottos, that of Asclepius and Diana.&lt;ref&gt;Allain and Christiany, 2006: 182&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fountain of the Owl used a series of bronze pipes like flutes to make the sound of birds but the most famous feature of the garden was the great Organ Fountain. It was described by the French philosopher [[Michel de Montaigne]], who visited the garden in 1580: "The music of the Organ Fountain is true music, naturally created...made by water which falls with great violence into a cave, rounded and vaulted, and agitates the air, which is forced to exit through the pipes of an organ. Other water, passing through a wheel, strikes in a certain order the keyboard of the organ. The organ also imitates the sound of trumpets, the sound of cannon, and the sound of muskets, made by the sudden fall of water ...&lt;ref&gt;Montaigne, M. E.. de, ''Journal de voyage en Italie'', Le Livre de poche, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

The garden was substantially changed after the death of the Cardinal and in the 17th century, and many statues were sold, but the basic features remain, and the Organ Fountain has recently been restored and plays music once again.

== Mannerism and the gardens of the Late Renaissance ==
Mannerism was a style which developed in painting in the 1520s, which defied the traditional rules of Renaissance painting. "Mannerist paintings were intensely stylish, polished and complex, their composition bizarre, the subject matter fantastic."&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 75.&lt;/ref&gt; This also describes other mannerist gardens which appeared beginning about 1560.

===Villa della Torre (1559)===
The Villa della Tore, built for [[Giulio della Torre]] (1480–1563), a law professor and humanist scholar in [[Verona]], was a parody of the classical rules of Vitruvius; the [[peristyle]] of the building was in the perfectly harmonious Vitruvius style, but some of the stones were rough-cut and of different sizes and decorated with masks which sprayed water, which jarred the classical harmony. "The building was deformed: it seemed to be caught in a strange, amorphous condition, somewhere crude rustic simplicity and classical perfection."&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The fireplaces inside were in the forms of the mouths of gigantic masks. Outside, the garden was filled with disturbing architectural elements, including a grotto whose entrance represented the mouth of hell, with eyes that showed fires burning inside.

=== Sacro Bosco at Bomarzo, Lazio (1552-1584) ===
[[File:Bomarzo parco mostri orco.jpg|thumb|Sacro Bosco, the ogre at the mouth of hell (1552-1584)]]
The [[Park of the Monsters|Sacro Bosco]], or "Sacred Wood," was the most famous and extravagant of the Mannerist gardens. It was created for [[Pier Francesco Orsini]] (1523–84) near the village of [[Bomarzo]]. It was witty and irreverent, and violated all the rules of Renaissance gardens; it had no symmetry, no order, and no focal point. An inscription in the garden said: "You who have travelled the world in search of great and stupendous marvels, come here, where there are horrendous faces, elephants, lions, ogres and dragons."&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Attlee, 2006: 85&lt;/ref&gt;

The garden was filled with enormous statues, reached by wandering paths. It included a mouth of hell, a house that seemed to be falling over, fantastic animals and figures, many of them carved of rough volcanic rock in place in the garden. Some of the scenes were taken from the romantic epic poem [[Orlando Furioso]] by [[Ludovico Ariosto]], others from works by [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[Petrarch|Francesco Petrarch]]. As one inscription in the garden notes, the ''Sacro Bosco'' "resembles only itself, and nothing else." &lt;ref&gt;Cited by Attlee, 2006: 87&lt;/ref&gt;

==The first botanical gardens==
[[File:Orto dei semplici PD 01.jpg|thumb|The Botanical Gardens of Padua (1543), from a contemporary engraving in the Basilica di Sant'Antonio.]]
The Italian Renaissance also saw a revolution in the study of [[botany]] through the systematic classification of plants and the creation of the first [[botanical garden]]s. During the [[Middle Ages]], plants were studied for the medicinal uses. Until the 16th century, the standard work on botany was ''[[Materia medica|De Materia Medica]]'' written in the 1st century AD by a Greek physician, [[Pedanius Dioscorides]], that described six hundred plants but lacked many of the native plants of Italy and had vague descriptions with stylized and inexact illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 40&lt;/ref&gt; In 1533, the [[University of Padua]] created the first chair of botany and appointed Francesco Bonafede as the first ''Professor Simplicium''- professor of 'simples,' or medicinal plants. In 1545, a scholar from the medical school of the University of Padua, [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli]], wrote a new book on [[herbalism|medicinal herbs]], ''Commentarii in libros sex Pedanii Dioscoridis'', which, in successive editions, systematically described and gave the medicinal uses of twelve hundred different plants. Such scientific work was aided by sailors and explorers returning from the [[New World]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], who brought back samples of plants unknown in Europe.

In June 1543, the University of Padua created the world's first botanical garden, the [[Orto botanico di Padova]], and the [[University of Pisa]] followed with its own garden, the [[Orto botanico di Pisa]], in 1545.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 46. The University of Pisa claims that its botanical garden was founded in 1543 and that of Padua, the Orto botanico di Padova, was founded in 1545, giving them the oldest garden, but according to Helena Attlee, the claim of Padua is better documented in the archives of the [[Republic of Venice]]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1591, the garden at [[Padua]] had over 1,168 different plants and trees, including a [[fan palm]] tree brought from [[Egypt]]. In 1545, in Florence, Cosimo de' Medici founded the ''Giardino dei Semplici'', the garden of medicinal herbs. Soon the medical schools of the universities of [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], [[University of Ferrara|Ferrara]] and [[University of Sassari|Sassari]] all had their own botanical gardens filled with exotic plants from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Attlee, 2006: 49&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jovan Hadži-Vasiljević''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Јован Хаџи-Васиљевић}}, 18 October 1866 – 29 March 1948) was a Serbian historian, ethnographer, journalist and writer. Hadži-Vasiljević was born in [[Vranje]], at the time part of the [[Sanjak of Niš]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until it was captured by the [[Serbian-Turkish Wars (1876-1878)|Serbian Army in 1878]].

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Are You Being Served?'' characters}}
This is a '''list of characters''' from the [[BBC Television|BBC]] [[British sitcom|sitcom]] ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' that ran from 1972 until 1985.
After the series ended, there was a spin-off series called '''Grace and Favour''', from 1992 until 1993 with many of the original actors reprising their roles. An Australian version was also produced. John Inman was the only actor to appear in all three series.

==Menswear==
This section contains information on the characters who worked in the Menswear department of Grace Brothers.

===[[Mr. Humphries|Mr Humphries]] (John Inman) (also appeared in [[Grace and Favour]] and [[Are You Being Served? (Australian TV series)|Are You Being Served? Australian edition]])===
Mr Wilberforce Claybourne Humphries ([[John Inman]]), sales assistant, later senior assistant in menswear. Mr Humphries' colleagues and 'best friends' (although he denied this) were Mr Lucas and Mr Spooner. His ambiguous [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]] was used as a catalyst for many comedic situations and one-liners. Mr Humphries was particularly noted for his mincing walk and his slightly high-pitched voice, which he discarded when answering the phone: "MENSWEAR", he intoned in a falsified baritone. He had one of the most famous [[catchphrase]]s of the era: when asked by a colleague, " Mr Humphries, are you free?" (to serve a customer), he always gave the exaggerated response, "I'm free!" in a very high pitched voice. As the series progressed he often arrived late at work in increasingly outrageous attire including [[punk rock]]er clothing and hair, [[motorcycle]] leather jacket and chaps, and a [[sailor]] uniform, always with an equally outrageous account of his previous night's activities and his efforts to make it to work on time nonetheless. On one occasion, Mr Lucas opined to him after a description of the previous evening: "It's all go at your place!" Mr Humphries frequently spoke of a companion or companions referred to only as "my friend", often in a situation that pertained in some way to the subject under discussion. Everyone always assumed that the friends that he mentioned were men and would sometimes ask about them, and Mr Humphries would answer back, "What makes you think it's a 'he'?!", often in a voice lowered by an octave. He was born in 1938/39, so throughout the show, his age was 33/34 - 46/47. He is often described as the most loveable character in the show, and was shown to be the most popular member of the floor in 'Shedding the Load' when he was the only member of staff not to receive a vote to be sacked.  In "Heir Apparent", Old Mr Grace believes that Mr Humphries was his son and all the staff are spoiling him.

=== Mr Lucas (Trevor Bannister) (series 1–7) ===
Mr James/Dick Lucas ([[Trevor Bannister]]) was the 'Jack the lad' junior menswear assistant, who was nearly always late for work but always had a creative excuse. He was not very concerned about the departmental pecking order, and made many sarcastic remarks, usually towards Mrs Slocombe. In the early series he had a relationship with Miss Brahms, as mentioned in 'Big Brother', however by later episodes she seems to have developed an antipathy towards him. Mr Lucas once called himself the 'best friend' of Mr Humphries, who was quick to deny it. His departure is never explained, although Captain Peacock remarked in the episode "Sit Out" after Mr Lucas left, on a day in which the departments had achieved no sales, that the last time the departments had no sales, "we fired the junior." Mr Lucas was thus made redundant, or terminated at will. (In real life, Trevor Bannister had already accepted a part in a tour for [[Middle Age Spread]] so he was unable to continue the role of Mr Lucas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy Richard]] – My Life Story by Wendy Richard with Lizzie Wiggin, Pocket Books/Simon and Schuster, 2001 page: 106 {{ISBN|0-7434-1523-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In the series Mr Lucas represents fresh, modern thinking contrasted with the stale, old-fashioned thinking that permeates Grace Brothers. In a series 5 episode, Mr Grace decides to Americanise the store, and the staff must call each other by their first names; Mr Lucas embarrassingly reveals to his co-workers that his first name is Dick, much to the delight of Mr Humphries. In "Shedding The Load" he signs a letter as Dick Lucas. But in the series 2 episode "[[The Clock (Are You Being Served?)|The Clock]]", Mr Mash addresses him as Mr James Lucas. Despite being the department junior, Bannister was, in fact, one year older than Inman.

===Mr Grainger (Arthur Brough) (series 1–5)===
Mr Ernest Grainger ([[Arthur Brough]]) was the original senior of the menswear department; he had been with Grace Brothers for over four decades. He resented being forced to share the floor with the Ladies Department. He vaguely resembled [[Winston Churchill]], in both appearance and demeanour, and had done impressions of him during the [[World War II|war]] while in [[Entertainments National Service Association|ENSA]]. Mr Grainger often fell asleep at work, and failed to wake up when called, unless Mr Humphries asked him "Mr Grainger! Are you free?" When flabbergasted or grumpy, Mr Humphries would often come to his aid and call: "Glass of water for Mr Grainger!" 
Little is known about his personal life, except his marriage, an illegitimate child from the 1950s with "a girl from haberdashery" and a sister.

Unlike his successors, Mr Tebbs and Mr Goldberg, who only lasted one series, and Mr Grossman and Mr Klein, who only lasted four episodes, Mr Grainger lasted five series and was thus the longest-serving menswear senior. Like Mr Rumbold, he was bald. He was 65 in 1974, so was born in 1909.

Although he generally got along well with the others, Mr Grainger was sometimes cranky and bad-tempered and would protest and become resentful whenever the menswear department had to share valuable space with the ladies, or when Captain Peacock would nonchalantly mention a perk he had earned despite having served less time at the store than Mr Grainger (such as a visit to the company boardroom). Once he had the opportunity to fill in for Mr Rumbold who was away for a one-month conference (this was a nice gesture, as it entitled Mr Grainger to a slightly bigger pension) but the position went to his head: he took advantage of all Mr. Rumbold's perks (in particular the liquor cabinet and [[cigar]]s), but imposed strict discipline on the rest of the staff: he threatened to make an adverse entry in Peacock's personnel record and he actually sacked Mrs Slocombe (however, he did repent his ways by the end of the episode). His character left when Arthur Brough died on 28 May 1978, while the sixth series was in pre-production. He was being written into the scripts at this time.

===Mr Tebbs (James Hayter) (series 6) ===
Mr Percival Tebbs ([[James Hayter (actor)|James Hayter]]) was Mr Grainger's first replacement as menswear senior, following the death of Arthur Brough (1978) who played Grainger. He shared many traits with his predecessor, but unlike the somewhat sloppy Mr Grainger, he was obsessed with order and propriety and considered himself an excellent salesman. He was also an overachiever and received a number of recognitions from Grace Brothers for his contributions. 
Although he was generally as rigid and somewhat stuffy as Mr Grainger, he did have a sense of humour about him, and particularly enjoyed, like Mr Lucas, insulting Mrs Slocombe, whom he considered to be a "crabby old cow". After only one year in the show, Mr Tebbs retired from Grace Brothers; Mr Tebbs' departure was the only one addressed by the series (as his retirement party at Grace Brothers is shown).

===Mr Goldberg (Alfie Bass) (series 7) ===
Mr Goldberg ([[Alfie Bass]]) replaced Mr Tebbs as menswear senior; he originally took on the junior position, while Mr Humphries and Mr Lucas were respectively promoted to Senior Assistants. However, Mr Goldberg had all of his friends' purchase goods from him the very next day after he was hired. As a result, he was quickly promoted to menswear senior, and Mr Humphries and Mr Lucas returned to their former positions. Goldberg often tried to supplement his wages, for example by establishing his own recruitment agency (and recruiting Grace Brothers' employees away to better-paying jobs). At his job interview, he revealed that he had spent time in the Army with Captain Peacock, to the shock and amusement of all except Captain Peacock. A slick businessman, Mr Goldberg allegedly burned down his own store for insurance purposes. In order to remain at Grace Brothers he blackmailed Captain Peacock with a picture of them in the army which showed Peacock in a corporal's uniform. Mr Goldberg was much more relaxed than his predecessors and was, in general, a friendly presence.

===Mr Spooner (Mike Berry) (series 8–10) ===
Mr Bert Spooner ([[Mike Berry (actor)|Mike Berry]]) (born 1942, aged 38–43), Mr Lucas's replacement, was similar to him in many ways: He was friends with Mr Humphries, he was sarcastic and lazy, but generally a lot less witty and charming. He made rude remarks, most frequently towards Mrs Slocombe (often being made to change tables in the canteen for this), didn't get on with Captain Peacock and had a hinted affair with Miss Brahms. In the final episode, he was demoted to lift operator but was quickly reinstated when he became a pop star.

===Mr Grossman (Milo Sperber) (series 8) ===
Mr Grossman ([[Milo Sperber]]) joined the clothing department after Young Mr Grace suggested having a small section of the men's and lady's department made into an area to sell shoes. Little is known about him as he only appeared in four episodes, although his first episode, in which he was transferred from the Shoe Department, revealed him to be an expert in shoe sales. Mr Grossman was a relaxed and friendly influence in the Men's Department and also spoke with a foreign accent.

===Mr Klein (Benny Lee) (series 8) ===
Mr Klein ([[Benny Lee]]), joined the department to help out with the sales but is from the Cutting Department. Speaks often of his wife, generally in disparaging tones, and doesn't object to quietly making jokes at Captain Peacock's expense. Other than that, his character remained undeveloped over his brief tenure. Like Mr Grossman, he lasted only four episodes, including the 1981 Christmas Special.

==Ladies wear==

This section contains information on the characters who worked in the Ladieswear department.

===[[Mrs. Slocombe|Mrs Slocombe]] (Mollie Sugden) (also appeared in spin-off Grace and Favour)===

Mrs. Mary Elizabeth Jennifer Rachel Abergavenny "Betty" Slocombe (née Yiddell), portrayed by [[Mollie Sugden]] was the senior in the ladies department. Born in 1926 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=|title=I'm Free! – The Complete ''Are You Being Served?''|first=|last=|publisher=Orion Books|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Founder's Day|episodelink=List of Are You Being Served? episodes#Series Five|series=Are You Being Served?|serieslink=Are You Being Served|airdate=1977-03-11|season=5|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Blackpool]]. She frequently sported elaborate hairstyles with brightly coloured rinses ranging from [[blue rinse|blue]] to more outrageous shades. Mrs Slocombe's husband left her, or was possibly arrested by the [[Fraud Squad (UK)|Fraud Squad]] (although viewers are finally introduced to him in the second series of ''[[Are You Being Served? Again!#Episode guide|Grace &amp; Favour]]''), and she lived with her cat, Tiddles, which she referred to as "my [[pussy]]"; this was the source of many a [[double entendre]], most of which Mrs Slocombe herself completely missed. Although Tiddles was generally referred to as a tomcat (male), this was contradicted in one episode when Tiddles had a litter of kittens in the store. Mrs Slocombe also tried to sound refined and "posh", but when exasperated or annoyed, she revealed more than a trace of a working-class [[Northern England English|Northern]] accent. She developed something of an adversarial relationship with Mr Lucas, and later Mr Spooner, frequently exchanging insults, despite her having gotten along reasonably well with Mr Lucas early on in the series.

===[[Miss Brahms]] (Wendy Richard) (also appeared in spin-off Grace and Favour)===
Miss Shirley Brahms ([[Wendy Richard]]) was the attractive junior ladieswear assistant who was often cheeky to Mrs Slocombe. Her [[Cockney]] accent was sometimes unintelligible, but she often put on a posher voice when answering the telephone. Under Mrs Slocombe's guidance, she became a more useful assistant throughout the series, though the hierarchy of Grace Brothers meant that she would have been promoted only when Mrs Slocombe left. She was attractive and receptive to the advances of Messrs Lucas, Spooner, Conway and, once or twice, Humphries. Because of her youth and life, she considers herself to have few standards. In one incident, she was approached to participate in a store-wide ''Holiday Girl'' contest with the assumption that she would easily win; but she refused, mainly because one of the prizes was a vacation aboard the yacht of Old Mr Grace, who had previously tried to indecently assault her. The biggest sale she ever made was when Mrs Slocombe was away, temporarily taking Mr Rumbold's place.

==Management==
This section includes the characters who had a management role at Grace Brothers.

===[[Captain Peacock]] (Frank Thornton) (also appeared in spin-off Grace and Favour)===
Captain Stephen Peacock ([[Frank Thornton]]), The somewhat stuffy [[floorwalker]], considers himself a cut above the assistants with both his position at the store and his dubious military record; he even feels the need to brag about his experiences fighting [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]] in [[North African campaign|North Africa]]. But Mr. Mash likes to tell the staff that Peacock served in the [[Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes|Naafi]] instead, and probably never left England, while Mr. Goldberg hints that Peacock was actually only a [[corporal]]. Allegedly, despite his military rank, Peacock began at Grace Brothers as a sweeper in the stockroom. Although Peacock usually talks as if he were a member of the elite [[Commando]] unit, on two occasions he admits he was in the [[Royal Army Service Corps]]. He is very pedantic with the staff (in one instance admonishing Miss Brahms for being one second late for work) as well as being rather disloyal to his colleagues (believing Mr Humphries guilty of stealing money from the till in spite of knowing him for 9 years). By 1975 he had been working at Grace Brothers for 20 years. In the episode "Front Page Story" Mr Humphries states that Peacock is 55, meaning he must have been born in 1926, the same age as Mrs Slocombe.  Captain Peacock is attracted to Mr Rumbold's secretaries, such as Miss Belfridge.  His wife Mrs Peacock is seen in a number of episodes, to whom he has been married since 1959.

===Mr Rumbold (Nicholas Smith) (also appeared in spin-off Grace and Favour)===
Mr Cuthbert Rumbold ([[Nicholas Smith (actor)|Nicholas Smith]], the manager of the floor, was often mocked for his bald head, large ears, and lack of intelligence. Nicknamed "Jug Ears", he frequently took slang phrases literally, leading to his formulating far-fetched explanations of incidents between staff members. He often took credit for others' ideas but subsequently tried to deny all involvement when the idea inevitably proved disastrous. Mr Rumbold's greatest ambition was to become a director of Grace Brothers: he looks up dreamily whenever the word "boardroom" is mentioned. He was usually oblivious to the sex appeal of his attractive secretaries. By the time of ''Grace and Favour'' Mrs Rumbold has left Mr Rumbold for a younger do-it-yourself man. In the episode "Roots" his brother Mycroft (also played by Smith) makes a brief appearance.

=== The Grace Brothers (Harold Bennett and Kenneth Waller) (series 1–8, series 8) ===
The Grace brothers, Young Mr Grace ([[Harold Bennett]]) and Old Mr Grace ([[Kenneth Waller]]), were the old-fashioned owners of the store. Both were old but loved young, curvaceous women. They both treated their employees with respect and encouragement, hence Young Mr Grace's catch phrase, "You've all done very well!" However, they were terminally naive to the fact that Grace Brothers was in its declining years. Despite the wealth of the family, they were somewhat stingy with money and paid their workers terribly, causing many strikes, disagreements and disruptions. Young Mr Grace started off as a fish salesman before inheriting the store from an uncle in 1926. Old Mr Grace remained an unseen character until series eight, and there was a recurring joke for many years in which, upon seeing Young Mr Grace for the first time, someone would ask in surprise, "That's ''Young'' Mr Grace?" The other person always replied, "Old Mr Grace doesn't get about much these days." Ironically, when he finally did appear in the show, Kenneth Waller (as Old Mr Grace) twenty-eight years ''younger'' than Harold Bennett (as Young Mr Grace), and thus the character was in much better condition both mentally and physically. It was revealed that Young Mr Grace had a wife who died in 1935. Young Mr Grace's age was a mystery. In 1976, it was said he was 80, yet in 1977, it was said he was born in 1897, and his 80th birthday was celebrated in that episode. In 1978, it was said that it was his 80th birthday then. Old Mr Grace was born in 1891, and celebrated his 90th birthday in 1981. He was married to Annie Grainger (as stated in Heir Apparent) but in that episode though he was married to Mr Humphries's mother. At some point, Young Mr Grace had a heart attack and was left with a very weak heart afterwards. Whenever his secretary showed off her legs, it would have a terrible effect on his heart. Both Old and Young Mr Grace are last seen in the episode "Roots".

==Maintenance &amp; Packing==
This section includes characters who worked in Maintenance &amp; Packing.

=== Mr. Mash (Larry Martyn) (series 1–3) ===
Mr. Mash ([[Larry Martyn]]) was a Grace Brothers maintenance man. He was frequently reprimanded by Captain Peacock for appearing on the sales floor during business hours, but had no fear of his superiors. He had a thorough knowledge of store operations and was a union agitator. He often bragged of taking home much larger pay cheques than the sales assistants due to overtime. Mr. Mash departed before Season 4, and replaced by Mr. Harman.

=== Mr Harman (Arthur English) (series 4–10) ===
Mr. Harman ([[Arthur English]]) replaced Mr. Mash in Series 4 as maintenance man. He shared some traits with Mr. Mash: both were "common" sorts and union men; and like Mash he battled with Captain Peacock over his appearances on the floor during store open hours. However, he was considerably less militant and was more friendly towards the sales staff than Mr. Mash. Reciprocally, the other staff were much more accepting of him than they had been of Mr. Mash, and he frequently acted as a member of the group and not just as an antagonist. He graciously assisted Mrs. Slocombe in the episode "The Apartment", when she was allowed to stay on the top floor of the building, by setting up various items of furniture and displays so that she could have all the creature comforts. He also masterminded the deception in "The Hold Up", dressing up as the leader of "The Gumby Gang" in order to fool the burglars who were holding Miss Brahms, Captain Peacock and Mr. Spooner hostage in Mr. Rumbold's office. Mr. Harman was last seen in "The Pop Star" (1984) which was the last episode of ''Are You Being Served?'' and therefore didn't appear in the sequel ''Grace and Favour''.

===Warwick and Seymour (Jimmy Mac and Keith Hodiak) (series 6–10)===
Warwick ([[Jimmy Mac (actor)|Jimmy Mac]]) and Seymour ([[Keith Hodiak]]) were both assistants to Mr. Harman in later series. Warwick made brief appearances from series six to series nine and Seymour appeared more visibly in three episodes of series ten. Two other assistants appeared throughout, one unnamed in one episode in series five and one named Stanford in two episodes in series nine.

==Secretaries==

This section lists details of the numerous secretaries who served Young Mr. Grace, Old Mr. Grace and Mr. Rumbold during the series:

=== Mr. Rumbold's First Secretary (Stephanie Gathercole) (Series 1 &amp; 2) ===

The first secretary to appear in the series was played by Stephanie Gathercole (who also provided the [[elevator operator|lift girl]] voice used in the theme song). Little is known about her, but she is wise to Mr. Lucas's tricks - when he walks past her, she wisely places a clipboard in front of her bottom. She appeared in the Pilot, Series 1 and one episode in Series 2.

=== Miss Ainsworth (Nina Francis) (Series 3) ===

Miss Ainsworth, played by [[Nina Francis]], was Mr. Rumbold's secretary in "The Hand of Fate" and "Coffee Morning" (series 3).

=== Miss Thorpe (Moira Foot) (Series 3) ===
[[Moira Foot]] played Miss Thorpe, who appeared as Mr Rumbold's new but temporary secretary in the episodes 'German Week', 'Shoulder to Shoulder' and 'New Look'. Her good looks attracted the attentions of Captain Peacock and even Young Mr Grace.

=== Mr. Rumbold's Secretary (Isabella Rye) (Series 4) ===

Isabella Rye appeared as Mr. Rumbold's secretary in "Forward, Mr. Grainger". She was said to have been reassigned from Young Mr. Grace's office because she was bad for his blood pressure.

=== Miss Hazelwood (Melita Manger) (Series 4) ===

Miss Monica Hazelwood appeared as Mr Rumbold's secretary in 'Oh, What A Tangled Web' when Mrs. Peacock accused her and Captain Peacock of having an affair. She had just dumped her fiancé and was not in a stable mood - and neither was Mrs. Peacock. The situation also made her father smash her wedding cake over Mr. Grainger's head.

=== Miss Bakewell (Penny Irving) (series 4–7) ===

Miss Bakewell ([[Penny Irving]]), Young Mr Grace's longest running and most loyal secretary, appeared from season 4 to season 7. She also appeared in the [[Are You Being Served? (film)]], but with her name changed to "Miss Nicholson". Her good looks often attracted the attention of the male staff at Grace Brothers.

=== Miss Edwards (Louise Burton) (Series 8) ===

Virginia Edwards is Old Mr. Grace's Deputy Secretary. She seems to pal up with Mr. Grace's nurse. In her interview, she sits on Mr. Grace's knee and types a letter, with one finger, that Old Mr. Grace is dictating to her. She only appears in a few episodes at the end of Series 8.

=== Old Mr Grace's Secretary (Debbie Linden) (Series 8) ===

Although never being assigned a name, Old Mr. Grace's Secretary ([[Debbie Linden]]) is very good-looking. When Old Mr. Grace first meets her, she is described by Mr. Harman as 'one owner since new, very sporty, and capable of high speeds if you put your foot down and she's all yours.' She is blonde, and often wears short skirts, low cut tops and she also has a small purple streak in her hair. She only appeared in five episodes in Series 8, after which Mr. Grace says that she is going off on a course.

=== Miss Belfridge (Candy Davis) (series 9–10) ===

Miss Belfridge ([[Candy Davis]]) was the longest-running secretary of Mr. Rumbold (lasting all of Series 9 and 10) and her beautiful face and voluptuous figure caught the attentions of most male members of staff (especially Captain Peacock, besides Mr. Rumbold). The busty blonde appeared to be smitten by Captain Peacock, often flirting with him. She appeared in many episodes and was the most prominent of Mr. Rumbold's secretaries. She has an [[O-Level]] in Literature, and is known for her flamboyant clothes and hairstyles. She is conscientious of her hair and nails, and is sometimes portrayed as mildly stupid.

==Relatives of staff==

=== Mrs. Annie Humphries (John Inman) (series 5, series 8) ===

Mrs Annie Humphries is Mr. Humphries' mother. She only appears twice during the show. The other times that we hear about her is from Mr. Humphries himself or from their telephone calls during and after work. Her marital status is unknown, in early series and in 'Heir Apparent' Mr. Humphries mentions his father, but for most of the show she stays with Mr. Humphries at a shared home, and Mr. Humphries speaks frequently about her, at one point saying 'I wish she'd get married again'. The first time she appears is in the episode ''Founder's Day'', where she explains how Mr. Humphries got his job at Grace Brothers. The second time she appears is in "Heir apparent", where Old Mr Grace is thought to be Mr Humphries' father. In this episode, Mr. Humphries' mother does come to Grace Brothers. Her first appearance was a video recording. John Inman was not credited for that episode. In the second episode, however, he was credited as a 'guest appearance'. In this episode the mother and son never cross paths, and one is always looking for the other. Mr. Humphries' mother often tries to make her son more manly. She often enrolls him in things that will 'make him a man'. In the movie, she overhears the female worker, Conchita, asking Mr. Humphries if she can share his bed. She tells him that 'the change will do him good.'

=== Mrs Peacock (Diana King/Diana Lambert) (series 4, 8, 9, 10) ===
Mrs Peacock ([[Diana King (actress)|Diana King]]/[[Diana Lambert]]) was the long-suffering wife of Captain Peacock. She always suspected Captain Peacock of cheating on her and all her on-screen appearances were during periods of marital discord. In Mrs Peacock's first appearance ("Oh What A Tangled Web"), she suspected Captain Peacock of having an affair with Mr Rumbold's secretary, Miss Hazelwood, because her brother had seen them in a car together, although he was later cleared. In her second appearance ("A Personal Problem"), because Captain Peacock had accidentally put his hands down Miss Pickthorpe's cleavage to retrieve some spilt blancmange and [[semolina pudding]] at a party (the department Miss Pickthorpe works for was never specified, and the semolina pudding turned out to be Mr Harrowgate and Miss Fawcett the year before. Like Miss Pickthorpe, their department was never found out). Mrs Peacock became Mr Rumbold's secretary, and she pretended that she was having an affair with him to make Captain Peacock jealous. In her third appearance ("The Sweet Smell Of Success"), Mrs Peacock burst into Mr Rumbold's office because she suspected Captain Peacock of flirting with Mr Rumbold's new secretary, Miss Belfridge. In her fourth appearance ("Grounds For Divorce"), Captain Peacock chose to stay with her rather than a bank/accounts clerk who had become infatuated with him. In her fifth appearance ("Friends And Neighbours"), Mrs Peacock came to the Grace Brothers houses to check up on her husband (like Mrs Rumbold), but she left satisfied (unlike Mrs Rumbold). Captain Peacock once mentioned that she had many brothers and sisters ("His And Hers" and "The Think Tank"). By the time of ''Grace and Favour'', Mrs Peacock seems to be either dead or divorced from Captain Peacock{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} as she is neither seen nor mentioned.

=== Mrs. Grainger (Pearl Hackney) (series 2) ===

Mrs. Grainger ([[Pearl Hackney]]) was Mr. Grainger's wife. She was mentioned by him, to miss ''[[Mrs Dale's Diary|Mrs. Dale's Diary]]'', despite that it had gone off the air over ten years earlier, and to want a world-cruise, when it appeared that Mr. Grainger had won a lot of money. Mrs. Grainger's only appearance was when she came to the store in "The Clock", to celebrate Mr. Grainger's 65th birthday. She was frequently mentioned by Mr Grainger throughout the series.

=== Mrs. Rumbold (Jean Challis) (series 10) ===

Mrs. Rumbold ([[Jean Challis]]) was Mr. Rumbold's wife. She was rarely mentioned and only appeared once in the show; that was when she suspected Mr. Rumbold of cheating on her ("Friends And Neighbours"), and she stormed into the Grace Brothers flats to see what was going on, and discovered her husband drinking champagne with his secretary, Miss Belfridge. By the time of ''Grace And Favour'', Mrs Rumbold had left her husband for Mr. Prentice of Tools and Hardware.

=== Mycroft Rumbold (Nicholas Smith) (Series 8) ===

Mycroft is Mr. Rumbold's brother. He is only seen once, and it is implied that he is an artist or family researcher, for he makes a shield for Old Mr. Grace's 90th birthday, to celebrate his roots, which were Welsh, then Scottish, then from Somerset, and then had something to do with the Black and White Minstrels. Unlike his brother, he has a head of flaming red hair, and has thin, metal-rimmed glasses.

== Supporting characters ==

=== The Canteen Manageress (Doremy Vernon) (series 3, 4, 6–10) ===
played by [[Doremy Vernon]]
Manageress of the canteen, mostly cooked disgraceful food, and had a large, rubbish-strewn kitchen. She frequently had arguments with the senior staff and wasn't worried about being fired due to her union, 'National Associated Canteen Employees, Restaurant and Domestic' (NACERD, a play on the term [[knackered]]). By Series 9, she had developed a friendship with the staff and appeared in the commercial of their night club in Series 10.

=== Nurse to the Grace Brothers (Pat Astley (Series 5) and [[Vivienne Johnson]] (Series 6-8) ===

Although her character was never given a name, the blonde nurse to both Old Mr Grace and Young Mr Grace appeared on the programme for three series. She is mostly recalled for her good looks and particularly for her seductive, husky voice; which was used for effect in the episode "Closed Circuit" when Miss Brahms' high-pitched Cockney accent proves to be incompatible as the public face of Grace Brothers' department store. Nurse dubs Miss Brahms' voice, causing a passing by Lord to become smitten with the sound of her. The nurse was generally professional and thorough (apart from her attire), and assisted with most of the medical goings-on at Grace Brothers, even those that didn't involve the brothers themselves. Astley appeared as the character in series 5, while Johnson played the character in most of her appearances.

=== Goddard (Freddie Wiles) (season 1–6) ===

Goddard ([[Freddie Wiles]]), was the early chaffeur to Young Mr Grace. He appeared in many episodes between the pilot and season six. He always appeared in an old-fashioned chauffeur's uniform. Although regularly appearing and escorting Mr Grace around the store, Wiles was never credited for his role. However, [[Freddie Wiles]] played a porter in the final episode of season five and was credited.

==Minor characters==
This section contains the minor characters in ''[[Are You Being Served?]]''

=== The Cleaners (Hilda Fenemore and others) ===

Even though [[Hilda Fenemore]] played one character, (a cleaner), it was assigned three names - Elsie Makepiece, Daphne Ackroyd, and Ivy. She appeared between seasons two and seven, and always has her hair in curlers and wears a turban, except series seven where she wears a white, bright yellow overall. She speaks with a Cockney accent, and is apparently married, although her husband is only mentioned once.

In one episode she is joined by Gladys, played by Lambert (Cold Comfort).

In the final episode, the cleaners are played by Mary Bradley and Joan Dainty.

Other (silent and uncredited) cleaners were called Doris Poland, Ivy Plunkett, Hillary, Deirdre, Daphne, Beatrice, Ethel, Betty, Noreen and Mrs Wadonga.

=== Mrs Axelby ===

Mrs Axelby is the best friend and possibly close neighbour of Mrs Slocombe. She is never seen on screen but Mrs Slocombe mentioned her many times, mostly starting with the line "Me and my friend Mrs Axelby...".  They would seem to frequent a lot of bars together in search of men.  Many episodes begin with Mrs Slocombe relating an anecdote involving her and Mrs Axelby to Miss Brahms.  She is described as a tough woman, who plays many contact sports. In an earlier episode, she is referred to as 'Mrs. Elthrop'.

=== Tiddles and Winston ===

Tiddles was the pet cat and longtime feline companion of Mrs Slocombe. Mrs Slocombe refers to Tiddles as her "pussy". Mrs. Slocombe clearly loves Tiddles often voicing her dislike for staying behind for a staff meeting, or coming in early, due to inconveniencing Tiddles. It is later revealed that Mrs Slocombe owns a parrot/canary called Winston whom Tiddles does not get on with. In "Mrs Slocombe Expects", Mrs Slocombe discovers that Tiddles was pregnant and suspects that the father is a Burmese cat that lives nearby. Later, Mrs Slocombe becomes worried that Tiddles will go into labour when she is not there so decides to ask permission to bring her into work. When Mr Rumbold refuses, Mr Harman smuggles her into the tailor store in a coffee machine and she goes into labour. Tiddles's tail is actually seen coming out of the coffee machine (this was props, not a real cat). Mrs Slocombe is prevented from helping her. The management work out Tiddles is there. When they go in, they find that Tiddles now has six kittens. Captain Peacock and Mr Rumbold's anger are washed away at the sight of the "cute and enchanting" kittens. The credits then show each of the staff (apart from Young Mr Grace and Mr Rumbold) holding, smiling and cuddling one of the kittens. (Live kittens were shown briefly in the episode.) In "The Apartment", Mrs Slocombe is moving house and but finds she has squatters in her new house, so Mrs Slocombe temporarily moves into the store and makes up a little house and takes Tiddles and Winston with her. Tiddles is actually seen again in her carrier box (once again Tiddles is portrayed by props). In "Lost And Found", Tiddles went missing causes great distress for Mrs Slocombe. The staff receive news that one of her toys was found near a well. Fearing the worst, the staff decide to buy her a kitten called Madam Wou whose father was "Emperor Chong of Bangkok, five times triple champion". At the end, Tiddles returns with another six kittens and sired by Madam Wou's father. Mrs Slocombe also briefly wins another parrot/canary in the Lottery. In "The Night Club", Mrs Slocombe tries to send a telephone message to Tiddles but accidentally sends it to a neighbour, making him think that she fancies him. Tiddles was seen live for the first time in ''[[Grace and Favour]]''. In "Fifty Years On", it is revealed that Tiddles was born in the late 1960s. Tiddles's appearance keeps changing throughout the series. In "Mrs Slocombe Expects", Tiddles appears to be a grey tabby. In "The Apartment", Tiddles is a black cat. In Grace and Favour, Tiddles is a blueish-grey Persian cat. Also in Grace and Favour, it is revealed that Mrs Slocombe had a cat before Tiddles, in 1951. Despite having been depicted as having had kittens with male cats (two litters: six in each, making twelve), and being referenced as a female in some episodes, Tiddles was sometimes referred to as a tomcat (male).

=== Edna Comlozi (Avril Angers) (Series 7)===

Despite only appearing in one episode in series 7 ("Mrs. Slocombe, Senior Person"), Miss Edna Comlozi ([[Avril  Angers]]), is mentioned in several other episodes, and works in the Cosmetics department. In a later episode, it is said she was fired for being rude to a customer. In earlier episodes, she is said to be a friend of Mrs. Slocombe, but in her appearance she is heard to call Mrs. Slocombe a 'silly old bitch'. Mrs. Slocombe's response to this was "Fancy Cat!" spoken in a low, resentful tone.

=== Mr Patel (Renu Setna) (Series 7)===

Mr Patel ([[Renu Setna]]), is the head of the Accounts Department. He only appeared in one series 7 episode, but is mentioned frequently by members of staff. In a later episode, he has resigned due to one of Old Mr. Grace's new rules or schemes. He is from either India or Bangladesh, for he is said to eat curry and chapatis.

This is a '''list of the bird species recorded in the Northern Mariana Islands'''. The avifauna of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] include a total of 104 species, of which one is [[Endemism in birds|endemic]], one has been [[Introduced species|introduced]] by humans and three are rare or accidental. Five species are globally threatened.

This list's [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of ''[[The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World]]'', 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for the Northern Mariana Islands.

The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories.

*(A) '''[[Vagrancy (biology)|Accidental]]''' - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in the Northern Mariana Islands
*(E) '''[[Endemic]]''' - a species endemic to the Northern Mariana Islands
*(I) '''[[Introduced species|Introduced]]''' - a species introduced to the Northern Mariana Islands as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions

{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=y}}

==Shearwaters and petrels==
'''Order''': [[Procellariiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Procellariidae]]

The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized "true petrels", characterized by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. 

*[[White-necked petrel]], ''Pterodroma cervicalis''  
*[[Bonin petrel]], ''Pterodroma hypoleuca''  
*[[Black-winged petrel]], ''Pterodroma nigripennis''  
*[[Bulwer's Petrel]], ''Bulweria bulwerii'' 
*[[Streaked shearwater]], ''Calonectris leucomelas''
*[[Wedge-tailed shearwater]], ''Ardenna pacificus''
*[[Short-tailed shearwater]], ''Ardenna tenuirostris''
*[[Christmas shearwater]], ''Puffinus nativitatis''
*[[Newell's shearwater]], ''Puffinus newelli''
*[[Tropical shearwater]], ''Puffinus bailloni''

==Northern storm petrels==
'''Order''': [[Procellariiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Hydrobatidae]]

The [[northern storm petrel]]s are relatives of the [[petrel]]s and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on [[plankton]]ic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes [[bat]]-like.

*[[Leach's storm petrel]], ''Oceanodroma leucorhoa''
*[[Matsudaira's storm petrel]], ''Oceanodroma matsudairae''

==Tropicbirds==
'''Order''': [[Phaethontiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Phaethontidae]]

[[Tropicbird]]s are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings.

*[[Red-tailed tropicbird]], ''Phaethon rubricauda''
*[[White-tailed tropicbird]], ''Phaethon lepturus''

==Boobies and gannets==
'''Order''': [[Suliformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Sulidae]]

The sulids comprise the [[gannet]]s and [[Booby|boobies]]. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish.

*[[Masked booby]], ''Sula dactylatra''
*[[Red-footed booby]], ''Sula sula''
*[[Brown booby]], ''Sula leucogaster''

==Cormorants==
'''Order''': [[Suliformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Phalacrocoracidae]]

Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage coloration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colorful. 

*[[Little pied cormorant]], ''Microcarbo melanoleucos''

==Frigatebirds==
'''Order''': [[Suliformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Fregatidae]]

[[Frigatebird]]s are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black and white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week.

*[[Great frigatebird]], ''Fregata minor''
*[[Lesser frigatebird]], ''Fregata ariel''

==Bitterns, herons and egrets==
'''Order''': [[Pelecaniformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Ardeidae]]

The family Ardeidae contains the [[bittern]]s, [[heron]]s and [[egret]]s. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills. 

*[[Gray heron]], ''Ardea cinerea''
*[[Intermediate egret]], ''Ardea intermedia''
*[[Little egret]], ''Egretta garzetta''
*[[Pacific reef heron]], ''Egretta sacra''
*[[Cattle egret]], ''Bubulcus ibis''
*[[Striated heron]], ''Butorides striata''
*[[Black-crowned night heron]], ''Nycticorax nycticorax''
*[[Rufous night heron]], ''Nycticorax caledonicus''
*[[Yellow bittern]], ''Ixobrychus sinensis''

A '''monument''' is a type of—usually three-dimensional—[[structure]] that was explicitly created to commemorate a person or event, or which has become relevant to a social group as a part of their remembrance of historic times or cultural heritage, due to its artistic, historical, political, technical or architectural importance. Examples of monuments include statues, (war) memorials, historical buildings, archeological sites, and cultural assets. If there is a public interest in its preservation, a monument can for example be listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. &lt;ref name="WMF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmf.org/|title=Preserving Cultural Heritages|website=wmf.org |publisher=World Monument Fund |accessdate =2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The origin of the word "monument" comes from the Greek ''mnemosynon'' and the Latin ''moneo'', ''monere'', which means 'to remind', 'to advise' or 'to warn',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url        =http://www.thefreedictionary.com/monument
 |title      =Monument - definition of
 |website    =thefreedictionary.com
 |publisher  =The Free Dictionary by Farlex
 |accessdate =2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting a monument allows us to see the past thus helping us visualize what is to come in the future.&lt;ref name="ColeReed1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Young Cole|author2=Henry Hope Reed|title=The Library of Congress: The Art and Architecture of the Thomas Jefferson Building|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1P_bTHtdTwkC|year=1997|publisher=Norton|isbn=978-0-393-04563-5|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[English language|English]] the word "monumental" is often used in reference to something of extraordinary size and power, as in [[monumental sculpture]], but also to mean simply anything made to commemorate the dead, as a [[funerary monument]] or other example of [[funerary art]].

== Creation and functions ==
Monuments have been created for thousands of years, and they are often the most durable and famous symbols of ancient civilizations. Prehistoric [[tumuli]], [[dolmen]]s, and similar structures have been created in a large number of prehistoric cultures across the world, and the many forms of monumental tombs of the more wealthy and powerful members of a society are often the source of much of our information and art from those cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Patton, Mark (1993) ''Statements in Stone: Monuments and Society in Neolithic Brittany''. Routledge, London, {{ISBN|0415067294}}, pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt; As societies became organized on a larger scale, so monuments so large as to be difficult to destroy like the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Pyramid]]s, the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Parthenon]], the [[Great Wall of China]], [[India]]n [[Taj Mahal]] or the [[Moai]] of [[Easter Island]] have become symbols of their civilizations. In more recent times, monumental structures such as the [[Statue of Liberty]] and [[Eiffel Tower]] have become iconic emblems of modern nation-states. The term ''monumentality'' relates to the symbolic status and physical presence of a monument. In this context, German art historian Helmut Scharf states that “A monument exists in the form of an object and also as symbol thereof. As a language symbol, a monument usually refers to something concrete, in some rare cases it is also used metaphorically [...]. A monument can be a language symbol for a unity of several monuments [...] or only for a single one, but in a broader sense it can also be used in nearly all knowable planes of being. [...] What is considered a monument always depends on the importance it attributes to the prevailing or traditional consciousness of a specific historical and social situation.”

Basically, the definition framework of the term monument depends on the current historical frame conditions. Aspects of the Culture of Remembrance and cultural memory are also linked to it, as well as questions about the concepts of public sphere and durability (of the one memorized) and the form and content of the monument (work-like monument). From an art historical point of view, the dichotomy of content and form opens up the problem of the “linguistic ability” of the monument. It becomes clear that language is an eminent part of a monument and it is often represented in “non-objective” or “architectural monuments”, at least with a plaque. In this connection, the debate touches on the social mechanisms that combine with Remembrance. These are acceptance of the monument as an object, the conveyed contents and the impact of these contents.

Monuments are frequently used to improve the appearance of a city or location. Planned cities such as [[Washington D.C.]], [[New Delhi]] and [[Brasília]] are often built around monuments. For example, the [[Washington Monument]]'s location was conceived by [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|L'Enfant]] to help organize public space in the city, before it was designed or constructed. Older cities have monuments placed at locations that are already important or are sometimes redesigned to focus on one. As [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] suggested in his famous poem "[[Ozymandias]]" ("''Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!''"), the purpose of monuments is very often to impress or awe.

Structures created for others purposes that have been made notable by their age, size or historic significance may also be regarded as monuments. This can happen because of great age and size, as in the case of the [[Great Wall of China]], or because an event of great importance occurred there such as the village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] in [[France]]. Many countries use [[Ancient monument]] or similar terms for the official designation of protected structures or [[archeological site]]s which may originally have been ordinary domestic houses or other buildings.

Monuments are also often designed to convey historical or political information, and they can thus develop an active socio-political potency.  They can be used to reinforce the primacy of contemporary political power, such as the [[Trajan's column|column of Trajan]] or the numerous statues of [[Lenin]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. They can be used to educate the populace about important events or figures from the past, such as in the renaming of the old General Post Office Building in New York City to the James A. Farley Building ([[James Farley Post Office]]), after former Postmaster General [[James Farley]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VsmZphjPLJQC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q=false&amp;f=false David Gardner Chardavoyne (2012), ''United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan: People, Law, and Politics'', Wayne State University Press, p. 194]&lt;/ref&gt; To fulfill its informative and educative functions a monument needs to be open to the public, which means that its spatial dimension as well as its content can be experienced by the public, and be sustainable. The former may be achieved either by situating the monument in public space or by a public discussion about the it and its meaning, the latter by the materiality of the monument or if its content immediately becomes part of the collective or cultural memory.

The social meanings of monuments are rarely fixed and certain and are frequently 'contested' by different social groups. As an example: whilst the former East German socialist state may have seen the Berlin Wall as a means of 'protection' from the ideological impurity of the west, dissidents and others would often argue that it was symbolic of the inherent repression and paranoia of that state. This contention of meaning is a central theme of modern 'post processual' archaeological discourse.

== Protection and preservation ==
The term is often used to describe any structure that is a significant and legally protected historic work, and many countries have equivalents of what is called in [[United Kingdom]] legislation a [[Scheduled Monument]], which often include relatively recent buildings constructed for residential or industrial purposes, with no thought at the time that they would come to be regarded as "monuments".

Until recently, it was customary for [[archaeologist]]s to study large monuments and pay less attention to the everyday lives of the societies that created them. New ideas about what constitutes the [[archaeological record]] have revealed that certain legislative and theoretical approaches to the subject are too focused on earlier definitions of monuments. An example has been the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]] laws.

Other than municipal or national government that protecting the monuments in their jurisdiction, there are institutions dedicated on the efforts to protect and preserve monuments that considered to possess special natural or cultural significance for the world, such as [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]] programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Heritage|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/about/|work=unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[World Monuments Fund]].&lt;ref name="WMF"/&gt;

Recently, more and more monuments are being preserved digitally (in 3D models) through organisations as [[CyArk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slashgear.com/cyark-to-digitally-scan-500-world-monuments-in-5-years-22302676/ CyArk preserving monuments digitally]. slashgear.com. October 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

The '''Monument to the Negev Brigade''' ({{lang-he|אנדרטת חטיבת הנגב}}, ''Andartat Hativat HaNegev''), known locally as the '''Andarta''', is a monument designed by [[Dani Karavan]] in memory of the members of the [[Palmach]] [[Negev Brigade]] who fell fighting on [[Israel]]'s side during the [[1948 Arab Israeli War]]. It is situated on a hill overlooking the city of [[Beersheba]] from the east and constitutes a recognized symbol of the [[Negev]] and Beersheba. In addition to its strengths as a memorial, it was a precursor to the [[land art]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Honnef, Manfred Schneckenburger, Christiane Fricke, and Karl Ruhrberg. ''ART of the 20th Century.'' Taschen. 2000. Pg. 544.&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument was built between 1963 and 1968 at a time when Israel was making many physical memorials to those who fought and died in its wars.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs. [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Facts+About+Israel/Culture/CULTURE-+Visual+Arts.htm ''CULTURE: Visual Arts.''] 1 Oct 2006 - accessed on 5 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It is made of raw concrete consisting of eighteen separate elements covering 10,000 square meters. These elements are symbolic and connected to Palmach and to the War of Independence.

The perforated tower alludes to a watchtower shelled with gunfire and the pipeline tunnel is reminiscent of the channel of water in the Negev defended by the soldiers. Engraved in the concrete are the names of the 324 soldiers who died in the war,&lt;ref&gt;Israel Ministry of Defense. [http://www.izkor.gov.il/AndartaNames.aspx?id=81001 ''Names of the Fallen''] 2010 - accessed on 15 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the badge of the Palmach, diary passages from the soldiers, the battle registry, verses (from the Bible 2 Kings 2:12&lt;ref&gt;in Hebrew: "My father! My father! The chariots and horsemen of Israel!"&lt;/ref&gt;)  and songs.

It is the highest [[African mountains|mountain in Africa]], about {{convert|4900|m|ft}} from its base, and {{Convert|5895|m|ft}} above sea level. The first people known to have reached the summit of the mountain were [[Hans Meyer (geologist)|Hans Meyer]] and [[Ludwig Purtscheller]] in 1889. The mountain is part of the [[Kilimanjaro National Park]] and is a major climbing destination. The mountain has been the subject of many scientific studies because of its shrinking glaciers and disappearing ice fields.

Uhuru Peak is the highest summit on Kibo's crater rim. The [[Tanzania National Parks Authority]], a Tanzanian governmental agency,&lt;ref name="TNP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanzaniaparks.com/kili.html |title=Kilimanjaro National Park |publisher=Tanzania National Parks |work=Tanzania National Parks |accessdate=16 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923032157/http://www.tanzaniaparks.com/kili.html |archivedate=23 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]]&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; list the height of Uhuru Peak as {{Convert|5895|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. That height is based on a [[Ordnance Survey|British Ordnance Survey]] in 1952.&lt;ref name="Digital"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1142/paper12.pdf | title=The New Digital Orthometric Elevation Model of Kilimanjaro | publisher=CEUR Workshop Proceedings | accessdate=16 July 2015 | author=Pascal Sirguey, Nicolas J. Cullen and Jorge Filipe Dos Santos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the height has been measured as {{Convert|5892|m|ft}} in 1999, {{Convert|5891|m|ft}} in 2008, and {{Convert|5888|m|ft}} in 2014.&lt;ref name="Digital"/&gt;

=== Geology ===
The interior of the volcanic edifice is poorly known, given the lack of large scale erosion that could have exposed the interiors of the volcano.&lt;ref name="Preliminary"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4713936&amp;fileId=S0016756800066590 | title=Preliminary Notes on the Geology of Kilimanjaro | author=W. H. Wilcockson | journal=Geological Magazine | year=1956 | volume=93 | issue=3 | pages=218–228 | doi=10.1017/S0016756800066590| bibcode=1956GeoM...93..218W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eruptive activity at the Shira centre commenced about 2.5 million years ago, with the last important phase occurring about 1.9 million years ago, just before the northern part of the edifice collapsed.&lt;ref name="NonnottePhilippe"/&gt; Shira is topped by a broad [[plateau]] at {{convert|3800|m|ft}}, which may be a filled [[caldera]]. The remnant caldera rim has been degraded deeply by erosion. Before the caldera formed and erosion began, Shira might have been between 4,900 m (16,000&amp;nbsp;ft) and 5,200 m (17,000&amp;nbsp;ft) high. It is mostly composed of basic lavas with some [[pyroclastics]]. The formation of the caldera was accompanied by lava emanating from [[Fracture (geology)|ring fractures]], but there was no large scale [[Explosive eruption|explosive activity]]. Two cones formed subsequently, the [[phonolite|phonolitic]] one at the northwest end of the ridge and the [[diabase|doleritic]] "Platzkegel" in the caldera centre.&lt;ref name="NonnottePhilippe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Preliminary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnBarryDawson"&gt;{{cite book | author=John Barry Dawson | title=The Gregory Rift Valley and Neogene-recent Volcanoes of Northern Tanzania | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Om2oMjXK3R4C&amp;pg=PA56|year=2008|publisher=Geological Society of London | isbn=978-1-86239-267-0|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Mawenzi and Kibo began erupting about 1 million years ago.&lt;ref name="NonnottePhilippe"/&gt; They are separated by the "Saddle Plateau" at {{convert|4400|m|ft}} elevation.&lt;ref name="AnAscentOfKilimanjaro"&gt;{{cite journal |title= An Ascent of Kilimanjaro | author=C. Gillman | journal=The Geographical Journal | year=1923 |volume= 61 |issue=1 |doi= 10.2307/1780513 |jstor= 1780513 | pages=1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

[[File:Mount Kilimanjaro Dec 2009 edit1.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Kilimanjaro in December 2009]]
The youngest dated rocks at Mawenzi are about 448,000 years old.&lt;ref name="NonnottePhilippe"/&gt; Mawenzi forms a horseshoe shaped ridge with [[Rock pinnacle|pinnacles]] and ridges opening to the northeast that has a tower-like shape resulting from deep erosion and a [[mafic]] [[dyke swarm]]. Several large [[cirque]]s cut into the ring, the largest of these sits on top of the Great Barranco gorge. Also notable are the Ost and West Barrancos on the northeastern side of the mountain. Most of the eastern side of the mountain has been removed by erosion. Mawenzi has a [[subsidiary peak]] named Neumann Tower, {{convert|4425|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="NonnottePhilippe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Preliminary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnBarryDawson"/&gt;

Kibo is the largest cone and is more than {{cvt|24|km}} wide at the "Saddle Plateau" altitude. The last activity here has been dated to between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago and created the current Kibo summit crater.

An almost continuous layer of lava buries most older geological features, with the exception of exposed [[Stratum|strata]] within the Great West Notch and the Kibo Barranco. The former exposes intrusions of [[syenite]].&lt;ref name="Preliminary"/&gt; Kibo has five main lava formations:&lt;ref name="NonnottePhilippe"/&gt;
* [[Phonotephrite]]s and [[tephriphonolite]]s of the "Lava Tower group", on a [[Dike (geology)|dyke]] cropping out at {{convert|4600|m|ft}}, 482,000 years ago
* Tephriphonolite to phonolite lavas "characterized by rhomb mega-phenocrysts of sodic feldspars" of the "Rhomb Porphyry group", 460,000–360,000 years ago
* [[Phenocryst|aphyric]] phonolite lavas, "commonly underlain by basal obsidian horizons", of the "Lent group", 359,000–337,000 years ago
* [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyritic]] tephriphonolite to phonolite lavas of the "Caldera rim group", 274,000–170,000 years ago
* phonolite lava flows with [[aegirine]] [[phenocryst]]s, of the "Inner Crater group", which represents the last volcanic activity on Kibo

Kibo has more than 250 [[parasitic cone]]s on its northwest and southeast flanks that were formed between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago&lt;ref name="NonnottePhilippe"/&gt; and erupted [[picrobasalt]]s, [[trachybasalt]]s, [[ankaramite]]s, and [[basanite]]s.&lt;ref name="NonnottePhilippe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Preliminary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnBarryDawson"/&gt; They reach as far as [[Lake Chala]] and [[Taita-Taveta County|Taveta]] in the southeast and the Lengurumani Plain in the northwest. Most of these cones are well preserved, with the exception of the Saddle Plateau cones that were heavily affected by glacial action. Despite their mostly small size, lava from the cones has obscured large portions of the mountain. The Saddle Plateau cones are mostly cinder cones with terminal effusion of lava, while the Upper Rombo Zone cones mostly generated lava flows. All Saddle Plateau cones predate the last glaciation.&lt;ref name="Preliminary"/&gt;

According to reports gathered in the 19th century from the [[Maasai people|Maasai]], Lake Chala on Kibo's eastern flank was the site of a village that was destroyed by an eruption.&lt;ref name="ShearsonHyland"/&gt;

=== Drainage ===
The mountain is drained by a network of rivers and streams, especially on the wetter and more heavily eroded southern side and especially above {{convert|1200|m|ft}}. Below that altitude, increased evaporation and human water usage reduces the waterflows. The [[Lumi River (East Africa)|Lumi]] and [[Pangani River|Pangani]] rivers drain Kilimanjaro on the eastern and southern sides, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=William Dubois Newmark | title=The Conservation of Mount Kilimanjaro | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Is9h1vm90AC&amp;pg=PA22 | year=1991 | publisher=IUCN | isbn=978-2-8317-0070-0 | pages=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
[[File:Meyers b14 s0300a.jpg|thumb|The Historical map with "''Kilima-Ndscharo''" during the [[German East Africa]] in the year 1888]]
The origin of the name "Kilimanjaro" is not precisely known, but a number of theories exist. European explorers had adopted the name by 1860 and reported that "Kilimanjaro" was the mountain's [[Kiswahili]] name.&lt;ref name="Krapf"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Johann Ludwig Krapf | author2=Ernest George Ravenstein | title=Travels, Researches, and Missionary Labours, During an Eighteen Years' Residence in Eastern Africa: Together with Journeys to Jagga, Usambara, Ukambani, Shoa, Abessinia and Khartum, and a Coasting Voyage from Nombaz to Cape Delgado | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z78NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA255 | year=1860 | publisher=Trübner and Company, Paternoster Row. | page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1907 edition of ''The Nuttall Encyclopædia'' also records the name of the mountain as "Kilima-Njaro".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://words.fromoldbooks.org/Wood-NuttallEncyclopaedia/k/kilima-njaro.html | title=Kilima-Njaro | publisher=fromoldbooks.org | work=1907 Nuttall Encyclopædia of General Knowledge | date=1907 | accessdate=16 July 2015 | author=James Wood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Ludwig Krapf]] wrote in 1860 that Swahilis along the coast called the mountain "Kilimanjaro". Although he did not support his claim,&lt;ref name="Hutchinson"/&gt; he claimed that "Kilimanjaro" meant either "mountain of greatness" or "mountain of caravans". Under the latter meaning, "Kilima" meant "mountain" and "Jaro" possibly meant "caravans".&lt;ref name="Krapf"/&gt;

Jim Thompson claimed in 1885, although he also did not support his claim,&lt;ref name="Hutchinson"/&gt; that the term Kilima-Njaro "has generally been understood to mean" the Mountain (Kilima) of Greatness (Njaro). "Though not improbably it may mean" the "White" mountain.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/books?id=9PETAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Through Masai land: a journey of exploration among the snowclad volcanic mountains and strange tribes of eastern equatorial Africa'', authored by Johann Ludwig Krapf and Ernest George Ravenstein, Low, Marston, Searle, &amp; Rivington, London, 1887]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Njaro" is an ancient Kiswahili word for "shining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/tanzania.htm#PIA03355 | title=Perspective with Landsat Overlay | publisher=California Institute of Technology | work=SRTM TANZANIA IMAGES | accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Krapf wrote that a chief of the [[Kamba people|Wakamba people]], whom he visited in 1849, "had been to Jagga and had seen the Kima jaJeu, mountain of whiteness, the name given by the Wakamba to Kilimanjaro...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Johann Ludwig Krapf | author2=Ernest George Ravenstein | title=Travels, Researches, and Missionary Labours, During an Eighteen Years' Residence in Eastern Africa: Together with Journeys to Jagga, Usambara, Ukambani, Shoa, Abessinia and Khartum, and a Coasting Voyage from Nombaz to Cape Delgado | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z78NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA544 | year=1860 | publisher=Trübner and Company, Paternoster Row. | page=544}}&lt;/ref&gt; More correctly in the [[Kikamba language]], this would be Kiima Kyeu, and this possible derivation has been popular with several investigators.&lt;ref name="Hutchinson"/&gt;

Others have assumed that "Kilima" is Kiswahili for "mountain". The problem with this assumption is that "Kilima" actually means "hill" and is, therefore, the [[diminutive]] of "Mlima", the proper Kiswahili word for mountain. However, "[i]t is ... possible ... that an early European visitor, whose knowledge of [Kiswahili] was not extensive, changed mlima to kilima by analogy with the two [[Chaga languages|Wachagga]] names; Kibo and Kimawenzi."&lt;ref name="Hutchinson"/&gt;

A different approach is to assume that the "Kileman" part of Kilimanjaro comes from the Kichagga "kileme", which means "which defeats", or "kilelema", which means "which has become difficult or impossible". The "Jaro" part would "then be derived from njaare, a bird, or, according to other informants, a leopard, or, possibly from jyaro a caravan." Considering that the name Kilimanjaro has never been current among the [[Chaga people|Wachagga people]], it is possible that the name was derived from Wachagga saying that the mountain was unclimbable, "kilemanjaare" or "kilemajyaro" and porters misinterpreted this as being the name of the mountain.&lt;ref name="Hutchinson"/&gt;

In the 1880s, the mountain became a part of [[German East Africa]] and was called "Kilima-Ndscharo" in German following the Kiswahili name components.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Philip (1996): "Guide to Tanzania; 2nd edition." Bradt Guides.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 October 1889, [[Hans Meyer (geologist)|Hans Meyer]] reached the highest summit on the crater ridge of Kibo. He named it "Kaiser-Wilhelm-Spitze" ("[[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm]] peak").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://icaci.org/files/documents/ICC_proceedings/ICC2003/Papers/110.pdf | title=GERMAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CARTOGRAPHY OF SOUTH WEST AND EAST AFRICA FROM MID 19th CENTURY TO WORLD WAR I | publisher=University of Technology Darmstadt | accessdate=16 July 2015 | author=Demhardt, I.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; That name apparently was used until Tanzania was formed in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Further Notes on the Kibo Inner Crater and Glaciers of Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya | author=P.

The mountain may have been known to non-Africans since [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. Sailors' reports recorded by [[Ptolemy]] mention a "Moon Mountain" and a spring lake of the Nile, which may indicate Kilimanjaro; although available historical information does not allow differentiation among [[Mount Kenya]], the mountains of Ethiopia, the [[Virunga Mountains]], Kilimanjaro, and the [[Rwenzori Mountains]]. Before Ptolemy, [[Aeschylus]] and [[Herodotus]] referred to "Egypt nurtured by the snows" and a spring between two mountains, respectively. One of these mentions two tall mountains in the coastal regions with a valley with traces of fire in between. [[Martín Fernández de Enciso]], a Spanish traveller to [[Mombasa]] who obtained information about the interior from native caravans, said in his ''Summa de Geografía'' (1519) that west of Mombasa "stands the Ethiopian Mount Olympus, which is exceedingly high, and beyond it are the Mountains of the Moon, in which are the sources of the Nile".&lt;ref name="ShearsonHyland"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02993444 | title=Ueber die Gesteine des Kilimandscharo und dessen Umgebung | author=J.

The German missionaries [[Johannes Rebmann]] of Mombasa and Krapf were the first Europeans to try to reach the snowy mountain. According to English geographer [[Halford Mackinder]] and English explorer [[Harry Johnston]], Rebmann in 1848 was the first European to report the existence of Kilimanjaro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Mackinder | first= Halford | authorlink= Halford Mackinder | year= 1900 | title= A Journey to the Summit of Mount Kenya, British East Africa | journal= [[The Geographical Journal]] | volume= 15 | issue= 5 | pages= 453–476 | jstor= 1774261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3jdaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA879 "Kilimanjaro", authored by Sir.

Ltd., London, June 1916, volume 79, page 879]&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Meyer has claimed that Rebmann first arrived in Africa in 1846 and has quoted Rebmann's diary entry of 11 May 1848 as saying, "This morning, at 10 o'clock, we obtained a clearer view of the mountains of Jagga, the summit of one of which was covered by what looked like a beautiful white cloud. When I inquired as to the dazzling whiteness, the guide merely called it 'cold' and at once I knew it could be neither more nor less than snow.... Immediately I understood how to interpret the marvelous tales Dr. Krapf and I had heard at the coast, of a vast mountain of gold and silver in the far interior, the approach to which was guarded by evil spirits."&lt;ref name=meyer/&gt;{{rp|6}} In light of these sources, J. Shearson Hyland's assertion that Rebmann first saw the mountain in 1840&lt;ref name="ShearsonHyland"/&gt; appears to be erroneous.

===Climbing history===

====Nineteenth-century explorers====
In August 1861, the Prussian officer Baron [[Karl Klaus von der Decken]] accompanied by English geologist R. Thornton made a first attempt to climb Kibo but "got no farther than {{convert|8,200|feet|meters|disp=flip}} owing to the inclemency of the weather."&lt;ref name=meyer/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4S2gRvx5X6sC&amp;pg=PA20 | last=Dundas | first=Charles | year=2012 | origyear=1924 | title=Kilimanjaro and its People: A History of the Wachagga, Their Laws, Customs and Legends, Together with Some Account of the Highest Mountain in Africa | publisher=Routledge | page=20 | accessdate=4 November 2014| isbn=9781136249402 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1862, von der Decken tried a second time together with [[Otto Kersten]]. They reached a height of {{convert|14,000|feet|meters|disp=flip}}.&lt;ref name="Verdcourt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.conchsoc.org/collectors_east_africa/von-der-Decken-CC.php | title=Baron Carl Claus von der Decken – 1833–1865 – Collectors in East Africa – 31. | publisher=Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland | accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1871, missionary [[Charles New]] became the "first European to reach the equatorial snows" on Kilimanjaro at an elevation of slightly more than {{convert|13000|ft|m|disp=flip}}.&lt;ref name=meyer/&gt;{{rp|11}}

In June 1887, the Hungarian Count [[Sámuel Teleki]] and Austrian Lieutenant [[Ludwig von Höhnel]] made an attempt to climb the mountain. Approaching from the saddle between Mawenzi and Kibo, Höhnel stopped at {{convert|4,950|meters|feet}}, but Teleki pushed through until he reached the snow at {{convert|5300|meters|feet}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ludwig Ritter von Höhnel | title=Discovery of Lakes Rudolf and Stefanie: A Narrative of Count Samuel Teleki's Exploring &amp; Hunting Expedition in Eastern Equatorial Africa in 1887 &amp; 1888 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dGgLAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA196 | year=1894 | publisher=Longmans, Green | page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1887 during his first attempt to climb Kilimanjaro, the German geology professor Hans Meyer reached the lower edge of the ice cap on Kibo, where he was forced to turn back because he lacked the equipment needed to handle the ice.&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite book | author=Alex Stewart | title=Kilimanjaro: A Complete Trekker's Guide: Preparations, Practicalities and Trekking Routes to the 'Roof of Africa' | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOVR23e_Nm8C&amp;pg=PA81 | date=9 September 2010 | publisher=Cicerone Press Limited | isbn=978-1-84965-071-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|81}} The following year, Meyer planned another attempt with [[Oscar Baumann]], a [[cartographer]], but the mission was aborted after the pair were held hostage and ransomed during the [[Abushiri Revolt]].&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;{{rp|82}}

In the autumn of 1888, the American naturalist Dr. Abbott and the German explorer [[Otto Ehrenfried Ehlers]] approached the summit from the northwest. While Abbott turned back earlier, Ehlers at first claimed to have reached the summit rim but, after severe criticism of that claim, later withdrew it.&lt;ref name=meyer/&gt;{{rp|17–19}}

In 1889, Meyer returned to Kilimanjaro with the Austrian mountaineer [[Ludwig Purtscheller]] for a third attempt.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;{{rp|82}} The success of this attempt was based on the establishment of several campsites with food supplies so that multiple attempts at the top could be made without having to descend too far.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;{{rp|82}} Meyer and Purtscheller pushed to near the crater rim on October 3 but turned around exhausted from hacking footsteps in the icy slope.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;{{rp|82}} Three days later, on Purtscheller's fortieth birthday, they reached the highest summit on the southern rim of the crater.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;{{rp|82}} They were the first to confirm that Kibo has a crater.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;{{rp|82}} After descending to the saddle between Kibo and Mawenzi, Meyer and Purtscheller attempted to climb the more technically challenging Mawenzi but could reach only the top of Klute Peak, a subsidiary peak, before retreating due to illness.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;{{rp|84}} On October 18, they reascended Kibo to enter and study the crater, cresting the rim at Hans Meyers Notch.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;{{rp|84}} In total, Meyer and Purtscheller spent 16 days above {{convert|15000|feet|meters}} during their expedition.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;{{rp|84}} They were accompanied in their high camps by Mwini Amani of [[Pangani]], who cooked and supplied the sites with water and firewood.&lt;ref name=meyer/&gt;{{rp|135–186}}

The first ascent of the highest summit of Mawenzi was made on 29 July 1912, by the German climbers [[Eduard Hans Oehler]] and [[Fritz Klute]], who named it Hans Meyer Peak. Oehler and Klute went on to make the third-ever ascent of Kibo, via the [[Drygalski Glacier (Tanzania)|Drygalski Glacier]], and descended via the Western Breach.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;{{rp|85}}

In 1989, the organizing committee of the 100-year celebration of the first ascent decided to award posthumous certificates to the African porter-guides who had accompanied Meyer and Purtscheller.&lt;ref name="Lauwo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tzaffairs.org/1990/01/meyer-and-purtscheller-were-not-alone/ | title=Meyer And Purtscheller Were Not Alone | publisher=Tanzanian Affairs | date=January 1, 1990 | accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One person in pictures or documents of the 1889 expedition was thought to match a living inhabitant of [[Marangu]], Yohani Kinyala Lauwo.&lt;ref name="Lauwo"/&gt; Lauwo did not know his own age.&lt;ref name="Lauwo"/&gt; Nor did he remember Meyer or Purtscheller, but he remembered joining a Kilimanjaro expedition involving a Dutch doctor who lived near the mountain and that he did not get to wear shoes during the climb.&lt;ref name="Lauwo"/&gt; Lauwo claimed that he had climbed the mountain three times before the beginning of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Lauwo"/&gt; The committee concluded that he had been a member of Meyer's team and therefore must have been born around 1871.&lt;ref name="Lauwo"/&gt; Lauwo died on 10 May 1996, 107 years after the first ascent, but now is sometimes even suggested as co-first-ascendant of Kilimanjaro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.anotherland.com/africa/hg-0004.htm | title=The Old Man of Mt.

====Fastest ascent and descent====
The fastest ascent-descent has been recorded by the Swiss-Ecuadorian mountain guide [[Karl Egloff]] (born 16 March 1981 in [[Quito]]), who ran to the top and back in 6 hours and 42 minutes on 13 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Hart, [http://www.outsideonline.com/1931036/where-world-did-karl-egloff-come Where in the World Did Karl Egloff Come From?], [[Outside (magazine)|Outside]] 5, Mar 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Previous records were held by Spanish mountain runner [[Kílian Jornet Burgada|Kílian Jornet]] (7 hours, 14 minutes on 29 September 2010) and by Tanzanian guide Simon Mtuy (9 hours, 21 minutes on 22 February 2006).&lt;ref name="records"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.climbkilimanjaroguide.com/kilimanjaro-facts/#kilimanjaro-records | title=Amazing Kilimanjaro Records | publisher=Climb Kilimanjaro Guide | work=Mount Kilimanjaro Facts | accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.climbmountkilimanjaro.com/about-the-mountain/record-climbs/ | title=Kilimanjaro records | publisher=Climb Mount Kilimanjaro Ltd | work=Background information on Kilimanjaro | accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fastest female ascent and descent====
The female ascent record is held by [[Anne-Marie Flammersfeld]]. On 27 July 2015, she climbed to the summit in 8 hours, 32 minutes via the Umbwe Route, which is about {{convert|30|km|mi}} long. Born in Germany but living in Switzerland, she broke the record of Britain's [[Becky Shuttleworth]] who climbed to the summit in 11 hours, 34 minutes on 20 September 2014.&lt;ref name=records/&gt;&lt;ref name="Climb"&gt;[http://www.climbmountkilimanjaro.com/about-the-mountain/record-climbs "Record climbs", ''Climb Mount Kilimanjaro'', accessed 7 November 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Flammersfeld then needed 4 hours, 26 minutes to run down to the Mweka Gate, for a combined ascent and descent time of 12 hours, 58 minutes.&lt;ref name="Climb"/&gt; That broke the previous record of 18 hours, 31 minutes held by [[Debbie Bachman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climbkilimanjaroguide.com/female-speed-record-on-kilimanjaro "NEW FEMALE SPEED RECORD ON KILIMANJARO", ''Climb Kilimanjaro Guide'', accessed 7 November 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Youngest and oldest people to summit====
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Despite an age-limit of 10 years for a climbing permit, exceptions are occasionally granted. Montannah Kenney, a 7-year-old girl from Texas broke the world record as the youngest female to climb the tallest mountain in Africa in March 2018. Her motivation was the death of her late father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girl Who Wanted to ‘Be Closer to Her Dad’ Becomes Youngest Female to Hike Mount Kilimanjaro|url=https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/girl-who-wanted-to-be-closer-to-her-dad-becomes-youngest-female-to-hike-mount-kilimanjaro/|website=Good News Network|accessdate=11 April 2018|date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, Keats Boyd of Los Angeles was only seven years old when he summited Kilimanjaro on 21 January 2008. The oldest person to reach Uhuru Peak was Angela Vorobeva at age 86 years and 267 days. The oldest man to summit the mountain is American Robert Wheeler, who was 85 years and 201 days when he summited on 2 October 2014.

====Ascents by disabled people====
Wheelchair user Bernard Goosen scaled Kilimanjaro in six days in 2007, while in 2012 [[Kyle Maynard]], who has no forearms or lower legs, crawled unassisted to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro.&lt;ref name=records/&gt;

People who wish to trek to the summit of Kilimanjaro are advised to undertake appropriate research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.expeditionkilimanjaro.com/preparation.php | title=Prepare yourself for the Kilimanjaro climb | author=R. Stoppelenburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ensure that they are both properly equipped and physically capable. Though the climb is technically not as challenging as when climbing the high peaks of the [[Himalayas]] or [[Andes]], the high elevation, low temperature, and occasional high winds make this a difficult and dangerous trek. Acclimatization is essential, and even the most experienced trekkers suffer some degree of [[altitude sickness]].&lt;ref name=Acclimatization&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Muza, SR |author2=Fulco, CS |author3=Cymerman, A | title=Altitude Acclimatization Guide | journal=US Army Research Inst. of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report | issue=USARIEM-TN-04-05 | year=2004 | url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/xmlui/handle/123456789/7616 | accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dangers===
A small study of people attempting to reach the summit of Kilimanjaro in July and August 2005 found that 61.3 percent succeeded and 77 percent experienced acute mountain sickness (AMS).&lt;ref name="DaviesKalson2009"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nickkalson.com/Papers/Kili_WEM.pdf | last1=Davies | first1=Andrew J. | last2=Kalson | first2=Nicholas S. | last3=Stokes | first3=Suzy | last4=Earl | first4=Mark D. | last5=Whitehead | first5=Adam G. | last6=Frost | first6=Hannah | last7=Tyrell-Marsh | first7=Ian | last8=Naylor | first8=Jon | title=Determinants of Summiting Success and Acute Mountain Sickness on Mt Kilimanjaro (5895 m) | journal=Wilderness &amp; Environmental Medicine | volume=20 | issue=4 | year=2009 | page=315 | issn=1080-6032 | doi=10.1580/1080-6032-020.004.0311}}&lt;/ref&gt; A retrospective study of 917 persons who attempted to reach the summit via the Lemosho or Machame routes found that 70.4 percent experienced AMS, defined in this study to be headache, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, or loss of appetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Irwin3/publication/267102897_A_Retrospective_Study_of_Acute_Mountain_Sickness_on_Mt._Kilimanjaro_Using_Trekking_Company_Data/links/54da49c70cf233119bc29c23.pdf | last1=Eigenberger | first1=Paul | last2=Faino | first2=Anna | last3=Maltzahn | first3=Joanne | last4=Lisk | first4=Christina | last5=Frank | first5=Eddie | last6=Frank | first6=Amy | last7=Loomis | first7=Zoe | last8=Schroeder | first8=Thies | last9=Strand | first9=Matthew | last10=Irwin | first10=David | title=A retrospective study of acute mountain sickness on Mt.

===Deaths===
According to the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre in Moshi, 25 people died from January 1996 to October 2003 while climbing the mountain. Seventeen were female and eight were male, ranging in age from 29 to 74. Fourteen died from advanced high altitude illness, including one with [[HACE]], five with [[HAPE]], and six with both HACE and HAPE. The remaining eleven deaths resulted from trauma (three), [[myocardial infarction]] (four), [[pneumonia]] (two), cardio-pulmonary failure of other underlying cause (one), and acute [[appendicitis]] (one). The overall mortality rate was an estimated 13.6 per 100,000 climbers (0.0136 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://wodocs.com/docum/1474-international_society_for_mountain_medicine-viwcmm_abstracts-32.html | title=Deaths Due to High Altitude Illness Among Tourists Climbing Mt Kilimanjaro | authors=Markus Hauser, Andreas Mueller, Britta Swai, Sendui Ole Nguyaine | journal=Proceedings of the 2004 South African Travel Medicine Society | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mapping==
A map of the Kibo cone on Mount Kilimanjaro was published by the British government's [[Directorate of Overseas Surveys]] in 1964 based on aerial photography conducted in 1962 (Subset of Kilimanjaro, East Africa (Tanganyika) Series Y742, Sheet 56/2, D.O.S. 422 1964, Edition 1, Scale 1:50,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://www.fig.net/resources/proceedings/fig_proceedings/fig2014/papers/ts08b/TS08B_sirguey_cullen_6959.pdf | title=A Century of Photogrammetry on Kilimanjaro | accessdate=16 July 2015 |author1=Pascal SRIGUEY  |author2=Nicolas J.

Records from the Maundi crater at {{convert|2780|m|ft}} indicate that the vegetation of Kilimanjaro has varied over time. Forest vegetation retreated during the Last Glacial Maximum and the ericaceous vegetation belt lowered by {{convert|1500|m|ft}} between 42,000 and 30,000 years ago because of the drier and colder conditions.&lt;ref name="MaundiCrater"/&gt;

The Tussock Grassland is an area on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro that contains many unique species of vegetation like the [[water holding cabbage]].

==Animal life==
[[File:Elephants at Amboseli national park against Mount Kilimanjaro.jpg|thumb|Elephants at the [[Amboseli National Park]] against Mount Kilimanjaro]]
Large animals are rare on Kilimanjaro and are more frequent in the forests and lower parts of the mountain. [[African bush elephant|Elephants]] and [[African buffalo|Cape buffaloes]] are among the animals that can be potentially hazardous to trekkers. [[Bushbuck]]s, [[chameleon]]s, [[dik-dik]]s, [[common duiker|duikers]], [[mongoose]]s, [[sunbird]]s, and [[Common warthog|warthogs]] have been reported as well.

==Climate==
The climate of Kilimanjaro is influenced by the height of the mountain, which allows the simultaneous influence of the equatorial [[trade wind]]s and the high altitude [[anti-trades]], and the isolated position of the mountain. Kilimanjaro has [[Mountain breeze and valley breeze|daily upslope and nightly downslope winds]], a regimen stronger on the southern than the northern side of the mountain. The flatter southern flanks are more extended and affect the atmosphere more strongly.&lt;ref name="AnAscentOfKilimanjaro"/&gt;{{rp|3–4}}

Kilimanjaro has two distinct rainy seasons, one from March to May and another around November. The northern slopes receive much less rainfall than the southern ones.&lt;ref name="PlantEcology"/&gt; The lower southern slope receives {{convert|800|to|900|mm|in}} annually, rising to {{convert|1500|to|2000|mm|in}} at {{convert|1500|m|ft}} altitude and peaking "partly over" {{convert|3000|mm|in}} in the forest belt at {{convert|2000|to|2300|m|ft}}. In the alpine zone, annual precipitation decreases to {{convert|200|mm|in}}.&lt;ref name="PlantEcology2"/&gt;{{rp|18}}

The average temperature in the summit area is approximately {{convert|-7|C|F}}. Nighttime surface temperatures on the [[Northern Ice Field (Mount Kilimanjaro)|Northern Ice Field]] (NIF) fall on average to {{convert|-9|C|F}} with an average daytime high temperature of {{convert|-4|C|F}}. During nights of extreme [[radiative cooling|radiational cooling]], the NIF can cool to as low as {{convert|-15|to|-27|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="SinghSingh2011"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Vijay P.

Snowfall can occur any time of year but is associated mostly with northern Tanzania's two rainy seasons (November–December and March–May).&lt;ref name="SinghSingh2011"/&gt;{{rp|673}} Precipitation in the summit area occurs principally as snow and [[graupel]] ({{convert|250|to|500|mm|in}} per year) and ablates within days or years.&lt;ref name="TraceElements"/&gt;

== Glaciers ==
[[File:Kilimanjaro-1938-uwm.png|thumb|Aerial view of the Kibo summit of Kilimanjaro in 1938.]]
Kibo's diminishing ice cap exists because Kilimanjaro is a little-dissected, massive mountain that rises above the [[snow line]]. The cap is divergent and outwards splits up into individual glaciers. The central portion of the ice cap is interrupted by the presence of the Kibo crater.&lt;ref name="AnAscentOfKilimanjaro"/&gt;{{rp|5}} The summit glaciers and ice fields do not display significant horizontal movements because their low thickness precludes major deformation.&lt;ref name="TraceElements"/&gt;

Geological evidence shows five successive glacial episodes during the [[Quaternary]] period, namely First (500,000 [[Before Present|BP]]), Second (greater than 360,000 years ago to 240,000 BP), Third (150,000 to 120,000 BP), Fourth (also known as "Main") (20,000 to 17,000 BP), and Little (16,000 to 14,000 BP). The Third may have been the most extensive, and the Little appears to be statistically indistinguishable from the Fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bryan_Mark/publication/227643102_Quaternary_glaciation_in_Africa_key_chronologies_and_climatic_implications/links/00b7d52d451e477c9b000000.pdf | title=Quaternary glaciation in Africa: Key chronologies and climatic implications |author1=Bryan G.

In the late 1880s, the summit of Kibo was completely covered by an ice cap covering about {{convert|20|km2|mi2}} with outlet glaciers cascading down the western and southern slopes, and except for the inner cone, the entire caldera was buried. Glacier ice also flowed through the Western Breach.&lt;ref name="Kaser"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glaciers of Middle East"&gt;{{cite web | last=Young | first=James A.

The slope glaciers retreated rapidly between 1912 and 1953, in response to a sudden shift in climate at the end of the 19th century that made them "drastically out of equilibrium", and more slowly thereafter. Their continuing demise indicates they are still out of equilibrium in response to a constant change in climate over the last 100 years.&lt;ref name="Kaser"/&gt;

In contrast to the persistent slope glaciers, the glaciers on Kilimanjaro's crater plateau have appeared and disappeared repeatedly during the Holocene epoch, with each cycle lasting a few hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.211.435&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf | last1=Kaser | first1=Georg | last2=Mölg | first2=Thomas | last3=Cullen | first3=Nicolas J. | last4=Hardy | first4=Douglas R. | last5=Winkler | first5=Michael | title=Is the decline of ice on Kilimanjaro unprecedented in the Holocene? | journal=The Holocene | volume=20 | issue=7 | year=2010 | pages=1079–1091 | issn=0959-6836 | doi=10.1177/0959683610369498| bibcode=2010Holoc..20.1079K }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1088}} It appears that decreasing specific humidity instead of temperature changes has caused the shrinkage of the slope glaciers since the late 19th century. No clear warming trend at the elevation of those glaciers occurred between 1948 and 2005. Although air temperatures at that elevation are always below freezing, solar radiation causes melting on their vertical faces. "There is no pathway for the plateau glaciers other than to continuously retreat once their vertical margins are exposed to solar radiation."&lt;ref name="Kaser"/&gt; Vertical ice margin walls are a unique characteristic of the summit glaciers and a major place of the shrinkage of the glaciers. They manifest stratifications, [[Ice calving|calving]], and other ice features.&lt;ref name="SinghSingh2011"/&gt;

==Mythology==
Local legends by the Chagga people tell how a man named Tone once provoked a god, Ruwa, to bring famine upon the land. The people became angry at Tone, forcing him to flee. Nobody wanted to protect him but a solitary dweller who had stones that turned miraculously into cattle. The dweller bid that Tone never open the stable of the cattle. When Tone did not heed the warning and the cattle escaped, Tone followed them, but the fleeing cattle threw up hills to run on, including Mawenzi and Kibo. Tone finally collapsed on Kibo, ending the pursuit.

Another legend has it that Kibo and Mawenzi were good neighbours, until Mawenzi played a prank on Kibo and threw away embers he had received from Kibo and claimed that they had burned out. Kibo eventually got angry and beat Mawenzi badly, explaining why the mountain is so badly degraded. This theory explains Mawenzi's name as "the Battered".

Other legends tell of ivory-filled graves of elephants on the mountain, and of a cow named Rayli that produces miraculous fat from her tail glands. If a man tries to steal such a gland but is too slow in his moves, Rayli will blast a powerful snort and blow the thief hurling down into the plain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Dundas|title=Kilimanjaro and Its People: A History of Wachagga, their Laws, Customs and Legends, Together with Some|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4S2gRvx5X6sC&amp;pg=PA36|date=12 November 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-24940-2|pages=84–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NASA SDO multispectral view of the Sun, September 2011.ogv|thumb|Video by [[Solar Dynamics Observatory|SDO]] simultaneously showing sections of the Sun at various wavelengths]]
A '''multispectral image''' is one that captures image data within specific wavelength ranges across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The wavelengths may be separated by [[Filter (optics)|filters]] or by the use of instruments that are sensitive to particular wavelengths, including light from [[electromagnetic spectrum|frequencies beyond the visible light range]], i.e. [[infrared]] and [[Ultraviolet|ultra-violet]].  [[Spectral imaging]] can allow extraction of additional information the human eye fails to capture with its receptors for [[Trichromacy|red, green and blue]].  It was originally developed for space-based imaging,&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Schowengerdt. Remote sensing: Models and methods for image processing, Academic Press, 3rd ed., (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and has also found use in document and painting analysis.

Multispectral imaging measures light in a small number (typically 3 to 15) of [[spectral bands]].  [[Hyperspectral imaging]] is a special case of spectral imaging where often hundreds of contiguous spectral bands are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hagen|first1=Nathan|last2=Kudenov|first2=Michael W.|title=Review of snapshot spectral imaging technologies|url=http://opticalengineering.spiedigitallibrary.org/article.aspx?articleid=1743003|website=Spie.

== Applications ==

=== Military Target Tracking ===
In 2003, researchers at the [[United States Army Research Laboratory]] and the Federal Laboratory Collaborative Technology Alliance reported a dual band multispectral imaging [[Focal-plane array testing|focal plane array]] (FPA) was reported.  This FPA allows researchers to look at two infrared (IR) planes at the same time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Goldberg, A.; Stann, B.; Gupta, N. (July 2003). "Multispectral, Hyperspectral, and Three-Dimensional Imaging Research at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory" (PDF). ''Proceedings of the International Conference on International Fusion [6th]''. 1: 499–506.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Multispectral imaging]] measures light emission and is often used in detecting or tracking military targets.  Because mid wave infrared (MWIR) and long wave infrared (LWIR) technologies measure radiation inherent to the object and require no external light source, they also are referred to as [[Thermography|thermal imaging]] methods.  

The brightness of the image produced by a thermal imager depends on the objects [[emissivity]] and temperature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.opto-engineering.com/resources/infrared-theory |title=Primer on IR theory |website=Opto Engineering |language=en |access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Every material has a [[infrared signature]] that aids the identification of the object.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-02-01|title=A survey of landmine detection using hyperspectral imaging|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271616306451|journal=ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing|language=en|volume=124|pages=40–53|doi=10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2016.12.009|issn=0924-2716}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These signatures are less pronounced in [[Hyperspectral imaging|hyperspectral]] systems, which work similarly to multispectral but use more bands, when exposed to wind and, more dramatically, to rain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Sometimes the surface of the target may reflect infrared energy. This reflection may misconstrue the true reading of the objects’ inherent radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Ning|last2=Zhao|first2=Yongqiang|last3=Pan|first3=Quan|last4=Kong|first4=Seong G.|date=2018-06-25|title=Removal of reflections in LWIR image with polarization characteristics|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-26-13-16488|journal=Optics Express|language=EN|volume=26|issue=13|pages=16488–16504|doi=10.1364/OE.26.016488|issn=1094-4087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imaging systems that use MWIR technology function better with solar reflections on the target’s surface and produce more definitive images of hot objects, such as engines, compared to LWIR technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Chuong|last2=Havlicek|first2=Joseph|last3=Fan|first3=Guoliang|last4=Caulfield|first4=John|last5=Pattichis|first5=Marios|date=November 2014|title=Robust dual-band MWIR/LWIR infrared target tracking|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7094401/|journal=2014 48th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, LWIR operates better in hazy environments like smoke or fog because less [[scattering]] occurs in the longer wavelengths.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The researchers claimed that dual band technologies combine these advantages to improve imaging particularly in the realm of target tracking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For nighttime target detection, thermal imaging outperformed single band multispectral imaging. Citation. Dual band MWIR and LWIR technology resulted in better visualization during the nighttime than MWIR alone. Citation Citation. The US Army reports that its dual band LWIR/MWIR FPA demonstrated better visualizing of tactical vehicles than MWIR alone after tracking them through both day and night.

By analyzing the emissivity of ground surfaces, multispectral imaging can detect the presence of underground missiles. Surface and sub-surface soil possess different physical and chemical properties that appear in spectral analysis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Disturbed soil has increased emissivity in the wavelength range of 8.5 to 9.5 micrometers while demonstrating no change in wavelengths greater than 10 micrometers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The US Army Research Laboratory’s dual MWIR/LWIR FPA used “red” and “blue” detectors to search for areas with enhanced emissivity. The “red” detector acts as a backdrop, verifying realms of undisturbed soil areas, as it is sensitive to the 10.4 micrometer wavelength. The “blue” detector is sensitive to wavelengths of 9.3 micrometers. If the intensity of the blue image changes when scanning, that region is likely disturbed''.'' The scientists reported that fusing these two images increased detection capabilities. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Ballistic Missile Detection ====
Intercepting an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) while it is in its [[Ballistic missile flight phases#Boost phase|boost phase]] requires imaging of the hard body as well as the rocket plumes. MWIR presents a strong signal for highly heated objected including rocket plumes, while LWIR demonstrates emissions for the missile’s material. The US Army Research Laboratory reported that with their dual band MWIR/LWIR technology, tracking of the Atlas 5 Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles, similar in design to ICBMs, picked up both the missile body and plumage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Space-based imaging ===
Most [[radiometer]]s for [[remote sensing]] (RS) acquire multispectral images.  Dividing the spectrum into many bands, multispectral is the opposite of [[panchromatic]], which records only the total intensity of radiation falling on each [[pixel]].&lt;ref name="STARS"&gt;{{cite web|title=3.1.1. Multispectral and panchromatic images|url=https://www.stars-project.org/en/knowledgeportal/magazine/remote-sensing-technology/introduction/multispectral-and-panchromatic-images/|website=STARS project|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, [[Earth observation satellite]]s have three or more [[radiometer]]s. Each acquires one digital image (in remote sensing, called a 'scene') in a small spectral band. The bands are grouped into wavelength regions based on the origin of the light and the interests of the researchers.

{{quote|text=Multispectral imaging combines two to five spectral imaging bands of relatively large bandwidth into a single optical system. A multispectral system usually provides a combination of visible (0.4 to 0.7 µm), near infrared (NIR; 0.7 to 1 µm), short-wave infrared (SWIR; 1 to 1.7 µm), mid-wave infrared (MWIR; 3.5 to 5 µm) or long-wave infrared (LWIR; 8 to 12 µm) bands into a single system. — Valerie C.

In the case of [[Landsat]] satellites, several different band designations have been used, with as many as 11 bands ([[Landsat 8]]) comprising a multispectral image.&lt;ref name="Landsat"&gt;{{cite web|title=What are the band designations for the Landsat satellites?|url=https://landsat.usgs.gov/what-are-band-designations-landsat-satellites|website=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grolier"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grolier|first1=Maurice J.|last2=Tibbitts Jr.|first2=G.

[[Spectral imaging]] with a higher radiometric resolution
(involving hundreds or thousands of bands), finer spectral resolution (involving smaller bands), or wider spectral coverage may be called [[hyperspectral]] or ultraspectral.&lt;ref name="Hyperspectral"&gt;{{cite web|title=Multispectral vs Hyperspectral Imagery Explained|url=https://gisgeography.com/multispectral-vs-hyperspectral-imagery-explained/|website=GIS Geography|accessdate=Feb 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tatem"/&gt;

=== Documents and artworks ===
The technology has also assisted in the interpretation of [[Herculaneum papyri|ancient papyri]], such as those found at [[Herculaneum]], by imaging the fragments in the infrared range (1000&amp;nbsp;nm). Often, the text on the documents appears to the naked eye as black ink on black paper. At 1000&amp;nbsp;nm, the difference in how paper and ink reflect infrared light makes the text clearly readable. It has also been used to image the [[Archimedes palimpsest]] by imaging the parchment leaves in bandwidths from 365-870&amp;nbsp;nm, and then using advanced digital image processing techniques to reveal the undertext with Archimedes' work.&lt;ref name=ARCHPALI&gt;{{cite web|title=Multi-spectral imaging of the Archimedes Palimpsest|url=http://archimedespalimpsest.org/about/imaging/|website=The Archimedes Palimpsest Project|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multispectral imaging has been used in a [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation|Mellon Foundation]] project at [[Yale University]] to compare inks in medieval English manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Weiskott, Eric. "Multispectral Imaging and Medieval Manuscripts." In ''The Routledge research companion to digital medieval literature''. Boyle, Jennifer E., and Helen J. Burgess. London: Routledge. Pp. 186-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multispectral imaging can be employed for investigation of [[paintings]] and other works of art.&lt;ref&gt;. Baronti, A. Casini, F. Lotti, and S. Porcinai, Multispectral imaging system for the mapping of pigments in works of art by use of principal-component analysis, Applied Optics Vol. 37, Issue 8, pp. 1299-1309 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is irradiated by [[ultraviolet]], visible and [[infrared]] rays and the reflected radiation is recorded in a camera sensitive in this regions of the spectrum. The image can also be registered using the transmitted instead of reflected radiation. In special cases the painting can be irradiated by UV, VIS or IR rays and the [[fluorescence]] of [[pigments]] or [[varnishes]] can be registered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/multispectral-imaging/ Multispectral imaging] at ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt;

Multispectral imaging has also been used to examine discolorations and stains on old books and manuscripts.  Comparing the "spectral fingerprint" of a stain to the characteristics of known chemical substances can make it possible to identify the stain. This technique has been used to examine medical and [[alchemical]] texts, seeking hints about the activities of early chemists and the possible chemical substances they may have used in their experiments. Like a cook spilling flour or vinegar on a cookbook, an early chemist might have left tangible evidence on the pages of the ingredients used to make medicines.&lt;ref name="Avril"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Avril|first1=Tom|title=Scans reveal secrets of medieval 'Harry Potter' book and medical texts at Penn|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/health/science/482322202.html|accessdate=14 May 2018|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spectral bands==
The wavelengths are approximate; exact values depend on the particular satellite's instruments:
* '''Blue''', 450-515..520&amp;nbsp;nm, is used for atmosphere and deep water imaging, and can reach depths up to {{convert|150|ft|m|-1}} in clear water.
* '''Green''', 515..520-590..600&amp;nbsp;nm, is used for imaging vegetation and deep water structures, up to {{convert|90|ft|m|-1}} in clear water.
* '''Red''', 600..630-680..690&amp;nbsp;nm, is used for imaging man-made objects, in water up to {{convert|30|ft|m|0}} deep, soil, and vegetation.
* '''Near infrared''' (NIR), 750-900&amp;nbsp;nm, is used primarily for imaging vegetation.
* '''Mid-infrared''' (MIR), 1550-1750&amp;nbsp;nm, is used for imaging vegetation, soil moisture content, and some [[forest fire]]s.
* '''Far-infrared''' (FIR), 2080-2350&amp;nbsp;nm, is used for imaging soil, moisture, geological features, silicates, clays, and fires.
* '''[[thermography|Thermal infrared]]''', 10400-12500&amp;nbsp;nm, uses emitted instead of reflected radiation to image geological structures, thermal differences in water currents, fires, and for night studies.
* '''[[Radar]]''' and related technologies are useful for mapping terrain and for detecting various objects.

==Spectral band usage==
{{further|False-color}}
For different purposes, different combinations of spectral bands can be used. They are usually represented with red, green, and blue channels. Mapping of bands to colors depends on the purpose of the image and the personal preferences of the analysts. Thermal infrared is often omitted from consideration due to poor spatial resolution, except for special purposes.
* '''True-color''' uses only red, green, and blue channels, mapped to their respective colors. As a plain color photograph, it is good for analyzing man-made objects, and is easy to understand for beginner analysts.
* '''Green-red-infrared''', where the blue channel is replaced with near infrared, is used for vegetation, which is highly reflective in near IR; it then shows as blue. This combination is often used to detect vegetation and camouflage.
* '''Blue-NIR-MIR''', where the blue channel uses visible blue, green uses NIR (so vegetation stays green), and MIR is shown as red. Such images allow the water depth, vegetation coverage, soil moisture content, and the presence of fires to be seen, all in a single image.
Many other combinations are in use. NIR is often shown as red, causing vegetation-covered areas to appear red.

== Classification ==
Unlike other [[Aerial photographic and satellite image interpretation]] work, these multispectral images do not make it easy to identify directly the feature type by visual inspection. Hence the remote sensing data has to be classified first, followed by processing by various data enhancement techniques so as to help the user to understand the features that are present in the image.

Such classification is a complex task which involves rigorous validation of the training samples depending on the classification algorithm used. The techniques can be grouped mainly into two types.
* Supervised classification techniques
* Unsupervised classification techniques

[[Supervised classification]] makes use of training samples. Training samples are areas on the ground for which there is [[Ground truth]], that is, what is there is known. The [[spectral signature]]s of the training areas are used to search for similar signatures in the remaining pixels of the image, and we will classify accordingly.  This use of training samples for classification is called supervised classification.  Expert knowledge is very important in this method since the selection of the training samples and a biased selection can badly affect the accuracy of classification.  Popular techniques include the [[Maximum likelihood principle]] and [[Convolutional neural network]].  The Maximum likelihood principle calculates the probability of a pixel belonging to a class (i.e. feature) and allots the [[pixel]] to its most probable class. Newer [[Convolutional neural network]] based methods &lt;ref name="Ran Zhang Wei Zhang 2017 p. "&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ran | first=Lingyan | last2=Zhang | first2=Yanning | last3=Wei | first3=Wei | last4=Zhang | first4=Qilin
 | title=A Hyperspectral Image Classification Framework with Spatial Pixel Pair Features

 | url=http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/17/10/2421 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; account for both spatial proximity and entire spectra to determine the most likely class.

In case of [[unsupervised classification]] no prior knowledge is required for classifying the features of the image. The natural clustering or grouping of the pixel values, i.e. the gray levels of the pixels, are observed. Then a threshold is defined for adopting the number of classes in the image. The finer the threshold value, the more classes there will be. However, beyond a certain limit the same class will be represented in different classes in the sense that variation in the class is represented. After forming the clusters, [[ground truth]] validation is done to identify the class the image pixel belongs to. Thus in this unsupervised classification apriori information about the classes is not required.  One of the popular methods in unsupervised classification is [[k-means clustering]].

The '''Macau Special Administrative Region''' ({{zh|c=|t=澳門特別行政區|p=Àomén Tèbié Xíngzhèngqū}}; {{Audio|Chinese-Macau full name.ogg|in Mandarin}}, {{Audio-nohelp|Chinese(Cantonese)-Macau full name.ogg|in Cantonese}}; {{lang-pt|Região Administrativa Especial de Macau}} {{Audio-nohelp|Portuguese-Macau full name.ogg|(listen)}}; abbreviated ''RAEM''), commonly known as '''Macau''' or '''Macao''' ({{zh|t=澳門|s=澳门|p=Àomén}}, or informally as 馬交 ''Mǎjiāo'') is one of the two [[special administrative region (People's Republic of China)|special administrative regions]] (SARs) of the [[China]] (PRC), along with [[Hong Kong]]. 

==Legend==
{{Main|History of Macau}}

The name [[Macao|Macau]] ({{IPA-pt|mɐˈkaw}})&lt;ref name="Name of Macau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geonames.org/MO/other-names-for-macao-s-a-r-china.html|title=Alternate Names or Name Variants for Macau Special Administrative Region|publisher=geonames.org|accessdate=2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; is thought to be derived from the ''[[Templo de A-Má]]'' (Temple of A-Ma or Ma Kok Temple) (媽閣廟, Cantonese [[Jyutping]]: ''Maa1 Gok3 Miu6'', local pronunciation: ''Maa5 Gok3 Miu6'' or ''Maa5 Gok3 Miu2''), a still-existing landmark built in 1448 dedicated to the [[goddess]] [[Matsu (goddess)|Matsu]] - the goddess of seafarers and fishermen.

In keeping with [[saga]], a fishing boat sailing across the sea one day found itself in an unexpected storm. Everyone on board was about to give up all hope of surviving this [[natural disaster]] when an attractive young lady, who had boarded the boat at the eleventh hour, stood up and ordered the tempest to calm down. The [[gale]] ceased and the sea became calm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mazu.org/mzwh/shengping/ |title= Home &gt; Mazu Culture &gt; Mom Zusheng Ping &gt; |publisher=Mazu.org |accessdate= 2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fishing boat, without further event, arrived safely at the port of Hoi Keang.  The young lady walked ashore to the top of the Barra Hill where, in a glowing
[[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] of light and fragrance; she immediately ascended into heaven. A [[temple]] was built on the specific location where she set foot.

Several hundred years later (circa 1513), when [[Portugal|Portuguese]] sailors landed and asked the name of the place, the locals replied "媽閣" ({{zh|j="Maa1 Gok3"}}). The Portuguese then named the peninsula "Macao"&lt;ref name="Hakka and Macau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.66163.com/Fujian_w/news/kfcb/kfcb9904/kfa-6b.html|title=Hakka and Macau|publisher=|language=Chinese|accessdate=2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several hundred years after that (circa 1911) they changed the spelling to "Macau" as part of the [[Reforms of Portuguese orthography]].

Today the two spellings remain in common use due to the transcription of place names in two different Chinese dialects. For [[Cantonese]], the dialect spoken in Macau and Hong Kong, the transcription is "Macau" the same as with [[Lantau Island]]. For Mandarin, the dialect that forms the basis of [[Standard Chinese]], the transcription is "Macao" the same as with [[Qingdao]].

The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name ''Aomen'' 澳門 ([[pinyin]]: ''Àomén'', Cantonese: ''Ou3 Mun4*2'' {{IPA-yue|ʔōu mǔːn|}}) means "''Inlet Gates''". The "gates" refer to two erect gate-like mountains of [[Nantai]] ({{zh|c=南台|p=Nántái}}) and [[Beitai]] ({{zh|c=北台|p=Běitái}}). Alternately, ''Ao'' may derive from Macau's previous name ''Heong San Ou'', as it is geographically situated at "Cross' Door".

Macau is also known as:
* Hou Keng Ou (壕鏡澳 Oyster-mirror Inlet)
* Heong San Ou (香山澳 Xiangshan Ao; Fragrant-mountain Inlet)
* Lin Tou (蓮島 Liandao; Lotus Island)
* Soda Port (梳打埠)

While ''Ou3 Mun2'' is the traditional Cantonese name of the place, it is common among the Cantonese-speaking population to use the source of the Portuguese name, 馬交 ''Maa5 Gaau1'' {{IPA-yue|ma̬ː káːu|}}.  The form "Macao" was the original Portuguese spelling, which continues to be used by the governments of some European countries that never made the change to "Macau". In the modern era, both the spellings "Macau" and "Macao" are accepted as correct spelling.

==Duality in English==
Since the [[transfer of sovereignty over Macau]] in 1999, the government of Macau considers both "Macau" and "Macao" to be acceptable spellings of the name in English language publications.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Dualism is visible in many English language government publications and documents, sometimes even within the same paragraph.{{which|date=September 2018}} For example, the spelling "Macao" appears on the local government's English language emblem as seen at its web portal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.mo/en/ |title=Macao SAR Government Portal |accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also at the official website of the Macao Government Tourism Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.macaotourism.gov.mo/index.php |title=Macao Government Tourist Office |accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, "Macao" is used on the [[Macau Special Administrative Region passport]], but the government's official explanatory note on the passport spells it as "Macau".&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223045907/http://www.dsi.gov.mo/documents/sar_pss_e.html |date=February 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Macao" is also the designated name of the [[ISO 3166-1]] country code [[ISO 3166-2:MO|MO]], and of the top-level domain [[.mo]].

==Official and diplomatic status==
{{Main|Macau Basic Law}}

There are two official versions of the Basic Law of Macau, one in Chinese and one in Portuguese, according to articles 136 and 137 of the Basic Law the place may represent itself as “中國澳門” or "Macau, China".

In comparison, the central government of the [[China]] consistently spells its name using the old Portuguese spelling "Macao". Less commonly used is the [[pinyin]] transcription of ''Aomen'', but its usage is not used officially. The decision not to adopt pinyin names after the handover to China appears to be consistent with the usual PRC policy of respecting the local linguistic traditions in the romanized version of names, as in other non-pinyin names like [[Lhasa]], [[Ürümqi]] or [[Hohhot]], for example. Phonetically the spelling "Macao" produces a pinyin pronunciation similar to 馬交 Mǎjiāo which explains the preference for this spelling among Mandarin speakers.

Notwithstanding the official [[Macao Basic Law|Basic Law of Macau]] requirement to use ''"Macau, [[China]]"'', Macau participates in [[international organisation]]s and international sport events like [[World Trade Organization]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] meetings and [[East Asian Games]] as ''"Macao, China"''.

== Technology  ==

The NextNav network uses [[Metropolitan Beacon System]] technology to deliver high precision three-dimensional indoor location capabilities across a market area. MBS is built on principles similar to [[GPS]]  transmitting precisely timed signals from a network of wide-area beacons enabling receivers to use [[trilateration]] techniques to determine their precise location. This differs significantly from other approaches to indoor and urban location, which rely on short-range, local-area transmitters.

Due to the terrestrial placement of the transmitters and sub-GHz nature of the signal, MBS signals can travel several kilometers and—because the network is specifically designed, deployed, and managed for indoor positioning—can be reliably received in deep indoor conditions that block satellite signals (e.g., GPS, [[GLONASS]]). MBS signals also enable location to be computed with far lower power drain than [[GPS]]. In addition, the system incorporates barometric pressure compensation technology that allows receivers equipped with pressure sensors to compute their altitude very precisely, typically within a floor.

A byproduct of the GPS-like operating principles of NextNav’s MBS network is the ability to deliver high-precision (Stratum-1-level) timing to indoor locations or in the event of [[GPS]] outages.

MBS receivers are being commercialized as an additional constellation added to multi-constellation [[GNSS]] processors. Today’s [[GPS]] processors typically process additional satellite constellations, and the MBS processing capability constitutes primarily firmware additions.

The performance of the technology under emergency dialing conditions was originally demonstrated in the CSRIC III test bed in San Francisco in 2012, with performance enhancements added on an ongoing basis. More recently the technology was enabled in the primary global telecommunication standards bodies, [[3GPP]] (Release 13)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3GPP Release 13 Specification Adds Support for Metropolitan Beacon System for Mobile Systems|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/3gpp-release-13-specification-adds-support-for-metropolitan-beacon-system-for-mobile-systems-2016-01-19|website=MarketWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and OMA (SUPL 2.0.3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OMA Secure User Plane Location (SUPL) v 1.0 &amp; 2.0 {{!}} OMA|url=http://openmobilealliance.org/about-oma/work-program/location/|website=openmobilealliance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; MBS signal technology is available under [[FRAND]] terms.

The technology can be scaled for any location application, including services to mobile phones, Internet of Things, and enterprise and public safety applications.

== Coverage  ==
NextNav's Urban and Indoor Positioning service is now available in San Francisco Bay Area, McLean, VA and other select markets. The Company has an initial presence in 45 additional markets in the US and is in deployment.

The '''pseudorange''' (from [[wikt:pseudo-|pseudo-]] and [[:wikt:range|range]]) is the ''pseudo'' &lt;!--an approximation of the--&gt; distance between a [[satellite]] and a navigation satellite receiver (see [[GNSS_positioning_calculation#Note|GNSS positioning calculation]]) —for instance [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) receivers. 

To determine its position, a satellite navigation receiver will determine the ranges to (at least) four satellites as well as their positions at time of transmitting. Knowing the satellites' [[orbital parameters]], these positions can be calculated for any point in time. The pseudoranges of each satellite are obtained by multiplying the [[speed of light]] by the time the signal has taken from the satellite to the receiver. As there are accuracy errors in the time measured, the term ''pseudo''-ranges is used rather than ranges for such distances.

==Pseudorange and time error estimation==
Typically a [[quartz]] oscillator is used in the receiver to do the timing. The accuracy of [[quartz clock]]s in general is worse (i.e. more) than one part in a million; if the clock hasn't been corrected for a week, the distance will put you not on the Earth but outside the Moon's orbit. Even if the clock is corrected, a second later the clock is not usable anymore for positional calculation, because after a second the error will be hundreds of meters for a typical quartz clock. But in a GPS receiver the clock's time is used to measure the ranges to different satellites at almost the same time, meaning all the measured ranges have the same error. Ranges with the same error are called pseudoranges. By finding the pseudo-range of an additional fourth satellite for precise position calculation, the time error can also be estimated. Therefore, by having the pseudoranges and the locations of four satellites, the actual receiver's position along the ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' axes and the time error &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; can be computed accurately. 

The reason we speak of ''pseudo''-ranges rather than ranges, is precisely this "contamination" with unknown receiver clock offset. GPS positioning is sometimes referred to as [[trilateration]], but would be more accurately referred to as ''pseudo-trilateration''. 

Following the laws of [[error propagation]], neither the receiver position nor the clock offset are computed exactly, but rather ''estimated'' through a [[least squares]] adjustment procedure known from [[geodesy]].
To describe this imprecision, so-called [[Dilution of precision (GPS)|GDOP]] quantities have been defined: geometric dilution of precision (x,y,z,t).
&lt;!-- Actually, the GDOP is computed from the actual satellite positions and is an indication of the quality of that satellite configuration for the calculated position. Satellites close together will give less quality than satellites spread out. It is correct that pseudorange calculations do not give the exact position, but the mathematical error can be made as small as is required. Every iteration using pseudorange calculations will give an improvement of a factor of over a 1000, so the mathematical accuration can go from 1000 km to 1 km, to 1 meter to 1 mm in only three steps. The calculation is an exact process which is repeatable, with four satellites' signals this is an exact process and given the input should always give the same result and is therefore not an estimate. Mathematically it's exact. The actual calculated position though is an estimate; this is not because of the process but because of a set of errors in the input.
How actual GPS receivers work if more than four satellites are available, is kept secret by the manufacturers of those receivers, but what's very probable is that the best GDOP is chosen to calculate the position, or a weighted average is made. It is improbable that a least squares method is used, because the satellite constallations with a "bad" GDOP are not weighted equally.--&gt;

Pseudorange calculations therefore use the signals of four satellites to compute the receiver's location and the clock error. A clock with an accuracy of one in a million will introduce an error of one millionth of a second each second. This error multiplied by the speed of light gives an error of 300 meters. For a typical satellite constellation this error will increase by about &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\sqrt 2}&lt;/math&gt; (less if satellites are close together, more if satellites are all near the horizon). If positional calculation was done using this clock and only using three satellites, just standing still the GPS would indicate that you are traveling at a speed in excess of 300 meters per second, (over 1000&amp;nbsp;km/hour or 600 miles an hour). With only signals from three satellites the GPS receiver would not be able to determine whether the 300m/s was due to clock error or actual movement of the GPS receiver.

If the satellites being used are scattered throughout the sky, then the value of geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) is low while if satellites are clustered near each other from the receiver's vantage point the GDOP values are higher. The lower the value of GDOP then the better the ratio of position error to range error computing will be, so GDOP plays an important role in calculating the receiver's position on the surface of the earth using pseudoranges. The larger the number of satellites, the better the value of GDOP will be.

* a straight portion of a stream or river, as from one turn to another;
* a level stretch, as between locks in a [[canal]];
* an arm of the sea extending up into the land.

As of 2015, the [[US Board on Geographic Names]] records 334 place names in the US with the characterization of a named "reach".&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=136:2:12938640691775:pg_R_49974142591090605124:NO&amp;pg_min_row=91&amp;pg_max_rows=15&amp;pg_rows_fetched=15 USGS Survey GNIS Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Zealand telephone numbering plan''' describes the allocation of [[telephone number]]s in [[New Zealand]] and the [[Pitcairn Islands]].

==History==
Until the 1970s, New Zealand's telephone network consisted primarily of [[Strowger switch|step-by-step]] telephone exchanges, or a mixture of [[Rotary system|rotary]] and step-by-step exchanges in the main centres. A few rural areas were still served by manual exchanges. [[crossbar switch|Crossbar]] exchanges were installed from the 1970s, and electronic exchanges from 1982. Local telephone number lengths varied from 3 to 6 digits depending on the size of exchange and population of the local calling area.

Numerous complex dialling instructions appeared in the front of telephone books explaining the number sequences needed to reach subscribers in local "free calling" areas, and in a few cases for short distance '''toll''' calls (usually to the local city or town), which were recorded on manually read meters in some step-by-step local exchanges. Local calls were free, and still are for residential customers. Long distance (toll) calls required the manual intervention of an operator, who had access to toll circuits, either via an operator's cord board or a toll exchange (switch). Access to the toll operator was by dialling ''0''.

Local directory service could be accessed via ''100'', telephone faults via ''120'', and emergency services by dialling ''[[1-1-1|111]]''.

=== Subscriber toll dialling (the historic codes)===
[[Subscriber trunk dialling|Subscriber toll dialling]] (STD) was introduced in the New Zealand telephone network in the mid 1970s, a result of the introduction of [[List of telephone switches#NEC|NEC]] crossbar-based toll exchanges and their ability to perform number translation. One still needed to dial ''0'' to make a toll call, but instead of calling the operator, one could then dial the STD number directly. Access to the operator was via ''010'', while other service numbers remained unchanged.

The original STD codes were numbered roughly south to north, with a few exceptions. Some of the STD codes were:

STD codes were assigned with larger areas having short STD codes (e.g. Auckland - 09), while smaller areas had longer STD codes and shorter local numbers (e.g. [[Shannon, New Zealand|Shannon]] - 06927). The total number length, that is STD code and local number excluding the first 0, usually totalled seven digits, but could vary up to nine, often as exchanges increased the length of local numbers to accommodate new lines.

===Reorganisation===
With the introduction of NEC [[stored program control]] exchanges in the New Zealand telephone network during the 1980s, and the rapid growth in demand, the breakup of the [[New Zealand Post Office]] and the creation of [[Spark New Zealand|Telecom]], local telephone numbers were standardised to seven digits. In many parts of the country, the old area code was incorporated into the new number, however in some areas the numbers changed completely.

|}

At the same time, the opportunity was taken to move directory service from '''100''' to '''018''' and charge for directory service calls. The justification for doing so was the introduction of a directory service computer system that gave access to current New Zealand telephone number listings, not just those printed in the telephone book, and the need for a separate user pays revenue stream for Telecom Directory Services, which was separate to the 5 regional (local) telephone companies, TNI and Telecom Mobile that Telecom had split itself into, as part of the sale of Telecom and deregulation of New Zealand telecommunications services.

Since 1993, land-line telephone numbers in New Zealand consist of a single-digit area code and a seven-digit local number, of which the first three digits generally specify the exchange and the final four specify the subscriber's unique line at that exchange.

==International number lengths==
The long distance trunk prefix, ''0'', which is prepended to national numbers, is not part of the international number.

The minimum number length after the international prefix is three digits. Most numbers, other than service numbers have at least eight digits.

The maximum number length after the international prefix is nine digits, except numbers starting with ''210'' (ten digits).

==Present numbering plan==
New Zealand follows an open numbering plan.{{cn|date=June 2018}} The [[Country calling code|country code]] is ''64''. The long distance dialing prefix is ''0''. The international prefix is ''00''.

===Landlines===
New Zealand landline phone numbers have a total of eight digits excluding the leading 0: a one-digit area code, and a seven-digit phone number (e.g. 09 700 1234), beginning with a digit between 2 and 9 (but excluding 900, 911, and 999 due to [[misdial]] guards).
There are five regional area codes: 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9. These must be dialled, along with the domestic trunk prefix, when calling a recipient outside the [[List of NZ local calling areas|local calling area]] of which the caller is located. For example, one calling [[Dunedin]] from [[Christchurch]] must dial 03, even though Christchurch is 03 as well.

The combined domestic trunk prefix&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/oth/T0202000099/en ITU allocations list]
&lt;/ref&gt; and area codes are:
*'''02 409''' for [[Scott Base]] in the [[Ross Dependency]]
*'''03''' for the [[South Island]] and the [[Chatham Islands]]
*'''04''' for the [[Wellington (region)|Wellington Region]] to Kapiti, but not the [[Wairarapa]] and [[Otaki, New Zealand|Otaki]]
*'''06''' for the remaining southern and eastern [[North Island]] including [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]], [[Manawatu-Wanganui]] (excluding [[Taumarunui]]), [[Hawke's Bay (region)|Hawke's Bay]], [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]], the Wairarapa, and Otaki
*'''07''' for the [[Waikato Region|Waikato]], the [[Bay of Plenty]] and Taumarunui
*'''09''' for [[Auckland]] and [[Northland Region|Northland]]

The first few digits of the local number can specify the general area of the telephone numbers. Note the names below are of the local calling areas.

===Mobile phones===
Telephone numbers for mobile phones begin with 02, followed by seven to nine digits (usually eight). The first few digits after the 02 indicate the original mobile network that issued the number.

Telephone numbers must always be dialled in full for mobile phones. In the late 1990s however, Telecom mobile phones could dial other Telecom mobile phones without the (then) 025 prefix, making 025 act like a landline area code.

The introduction of [[mobile number portability]] on 1 April 2007 meant that an increasing number of mobiles will be operating on a different network to that which originally assigned the number.
To find out whether a particular number belongs to a specific network provider, one can text the mobile number of interest to 300. It is a free service provided by 2degrees. A reply will be sent to verify whether the number is operating on their network or not.  Note:  Some reports indicate this service will work for Vodafone and Spark, but as at 05/11/2014 only 2Degrees appears to support this service.

===Other numbers===
====Toll-free and premium-rate calls====
Toll-free numbers begin with 0508 or 0800, usually followed by six digits (some numbers have seven digits).
Premium rate services use the code 0900 followed by five digits (some with six digits).
Local rate numbers, such as Internet access numbers, have the prefix 08xx, and are usually followed by five digits.

*'''0508''' Vodafone Tollfree
*'''0800''' Spark, Vodafone and other network operators Tollfree
*'''08xy''' Various non-geographic services
**'''083210''' Call Minder answerphone service
**'''08322''' Infocall numbers
**'''0867''' Dial-up Internet numbers
*'''0900''' Premium rate services

====Service numbers====
Numbers beginning with 01 are for operator services.

*'''010''' National Operator
*'''0170''' International Operator
*'''0172''' International Directory Service
*'''018''' National Directory Service

The '1' codes are used for local services, including activating exchange features. The emergency services number is '111'.

*'''[[1-1-1|111]]''' Emergency Services Operator (all telephones)
*'''112''' Emergency Services Operator for GSM Mobiles (only)
*'''11x''' Not allocatable. Used internally for specific emergency services.
*'''12x''' Network operator repair and sales services.

[[File:TheGreatRailwayBazaar.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Houghton Mifflin]])]]
'''''The Great Railway Bazaar: By Train Through Asia''''' is a [[Travel literature|travelogue]] by the American novelist [[Paul Theroux]], first published in 1975. It recounts Theroux's four-month journey by train in 1973 from London through Europe, [[the Middle East]], the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]], and his return via the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. Many people consider it a classic in the genre of [[Travel literature|travel writing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelliterature.org/reviews/bazaar.shtml Travelliterature.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928131822/http://www.travelliterature.org/reviews/bazaar.shtml |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=2-9780618658947-0 Powells.com ]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first part of the route, to India, followed what was then known as the [[hippie trail]]. It sold 1.5 million copies upon release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/william-dalrymple/2015/06/in-the-footsteps-of-marco-polo-the-journey-that-changed-william-dalrymples-life/ Spectator.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, Theroux explored several themes such as [[colonialism]], [[American imperialism]], poverty, and even ignorance, among others. These were embedded in his accounts of sights and sounds he experienced as well as his conversation with other people such as his fellow travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetravelmagazine.net/the-great-railway-bazaar-by-paul-theroux.html|title=The Great Railway Bazaar: By Train Through Asia|date=2008-03-27|work=The Travel Magazine|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included elements of fiction such as rich descriptions of places, situations, and people, reflecting the author's own thoughts and outlook. Contemporaneous reviews noted how his background allowed him the breadth of insights to authoritatively describe people even when there are instances when he committed ethnic generalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/00/06/18/specials/theroux-bazaar.html|title=A Certified American in a Highly English Mode|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the publication of ''The Great Railway Bazaar,'' Theroux lived in [[Africa]], [[Singapore]], and [[England]].

In a 2013 article,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/30/book-club-paul-theroux-railway|title=Paul Theroux on The Great Railway Bazaar – Guardian book club|last=Theroux|first=Paul|date=2013-05-30|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theroux outlined several inspirations that led him to embark on his famous journey and publish his experiences. These include his fascination for trains, which offered what he described as an opportunity to break monotony as well as a respite for him who never turns away work. He wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;I could think clearly on the London trains and when, on the rare occasions, I travelled out of London – on the Exeter line via Sherborne, Yeovil, and Crewkerne, to visit my in‑laws, or on the Flying Scotsman on a journalistic assignment, my spirits revived and I saw with clarity that it might be possible to conceive a book based on a long railway journey.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2006, Theroux retraced the journey, finding that people and places had changed, and that while he was famous for his earlier work he was not recognised in person. His account of this second journey was published as ''[[Ghost Train to the Eastern Star]]''.
