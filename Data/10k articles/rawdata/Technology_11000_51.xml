'''111 Eighth Avenue, in New York City,''' is a full-block [[Art Deco]] multi-use building located between [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth]] and [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|Ninth Avenues]], and [[15th Street (Manhattan)|15th]] and [[16th Street (Manhattan)|16th]] Streets in the [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] neighborhood of the [[Manhattan]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[New York City]].

At {{convert|2.9|e6sqft|m2}}, it is currently the city's fourth largest building in terms of floor area {{as of|2014|lc=yes}}. It was the largest building until 1963 when the {{convert|3.14|e6sqft|m2|sing=on}} [[MetLife Building]] opened.  The [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] (which opened in 1970–71) and [[55 Water Street]] {{convert|3.5|e6sqft|m2}}, which opened in 1972, were also larger but the World Trade Center was [[September 11 attacks|destroyed]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-largest-building-in-New-York-City |title=What is the largest building in New York City? |publisher=Quora |date= |accessdate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the {{convert|3.5|e6sqft|m2|sing=on}} [[One World Trade Center]] opened in 2014, 111 became the city's fourth largest building.

The building, which has been owned by [[Google]] since 2010, is one of the largest technology-owned office buildings in the world.  It is also larger than [[Apple Park]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s {{convert|2.8|e6sqft|m2}} headquarters in [[Cupertino, California]].

==Port Authority Commerce Building/Union Inland Terminal #1==
The building was designed by Lusby Simpson of Abbott, Merkt &amp; Co. and completed in 1932.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/12/google-nyc/ | publisher = ''Epicenter'' (blog of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'') | author = Gustin, Sam | title=Google Buys Giant New York Building for 1.9 Billion | date= December 22, 2010 | accessdate = May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aia4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=aia4&gt;{{cite AIA4}}, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The building had a multipurpose design when it opened in 1932 with the first floor and basement designated as "Union Inland Terminal #1" which was to be used to transport goods by truck to and from railroad lines and/or shipping piers.  The second floor was the Commerce section designed for exhibitions and the upper floors were designed for manufacturing.&lt;ref name="trainweb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.trainweb.com/bedt/indloco/pierstations.html#Inland%20Freight%20Station%20Overview |title=Railroad Operated Pier Stations &amp; Inland Freight Stations of Manhattan |publisher=Members.trainweb.com |date= |accessdate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wirednewyork73"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wirednewyork.com/forum/showthread.php?t=4949&amp;page=73 |title=NYC Commercial Real Estate - Page 73 |publisher=Wirednewyork.com |date= |accessdate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union Inland Terminal was built by the Port Authority to be a [[warehouse]]/[[union station]] to handle [[less than carload]] (LCL) shipments, consolidating the shipping functions of the Hudson River piers two blocks west of the building, the eight trunk railroads that operated a block west of the building and truck operations (an inland terminal by definition is a warehouse that is not immediately next to railroad lines/piers but is nearby and is used to relieve congestion at the transfer points).&lt;ref name="trainweb1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wirednewyork73"/&gt;

At its peak in the 1930s the Port Authority said it was handling more than half of the LCL freight operations south of 59th Street in Manhattan with more than 8,000 tons of goods passing through it each month. On one day alone in 1937 it was reported that 650 trucks had used the facility.&lt;ref name="trainweb1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wirednewyork73"/&gt; The railroads involved were the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]; [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]]; [[Baltimore &amp; Ohio]]; [[Erie Railroad]]; [[Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad]]; [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]]; [[New York Central Railroad]]; [[New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford]].&lt;ref name="trainweb1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wirednewyork73"/&gt; The building included four freight elevators that could carry fully loaded 20 ton trucks.&lt;ref name="trainweb1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wirednewyork73"/&gt; Because of the warehouse mission of the building it was able to avoid some of the [[Setback (architecture)|setback]] rules that greatly reduced the buildable space available for the skyscrapers that mark the Manhattan skyline.  As a result, the 15-story building with its football field size floors has more available rentable square footage than the 102-story [[Empire State Building]] which has 2.2 million square feet.&lt;ref name="trainweb1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wirednewyork73"/&gt; The construction occurred at a time of a massive projects built to deal with what at the time was street level freight railroad traffic on Manhattan's west side.  Other projects in the neighborhood in the era included construction of the [[High Line]] and  [[Starrett-Lehigh Building]].

==Port Authority Building==
The initial plan had called for more inland freight operations to be erected in Manhattan.  However the freight transportation changed and freight railroads played a dwindling importance in Manhattan.  By 1947 its initial mission was pretty much abandoned and it became the Port Authority Building which remained the Port Authority's headquarters until the opening of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="trainweb1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wirednewyork73"/&gt;

==Transition to the digital age==
The massive building served a dwindling warehouse/backoffice outpost until 1998 when Taconic Investment Partners acquired it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Holusha, John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/24/realestate/commercial-property-111-eighth-avenue-developers-taking-manhattan-formula.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=Commercial Property /111 Eighth Avenue; Developers Taking a Manhattan Formula to Chicago|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=October 24, 1999 |accessdate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taconic began marketing it as a location to be used as a [[carrier hotel]] for the new booming internet business.  This was coupled with the fashionable rise of the Chelsea neighborhood that surrounded it.&lt;ref name="wirednewyork73"/&gt;

In 2010, [[Google]], which had previously leased space in the building,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2010/01/19/google-leases-more-space-at-111-eighth-ave/|date=January 19, 2010|title=Google Leases More Space at 111 Eighth Ave.|author= Miller, Rich |publisher=datacenterknowledge.com| accessdate= December 3, 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101201150413/http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2010/01/19/google-leases-more-space-at-111-eighth-ave/| archivedate= December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; contracted to purchase the entire {{convert|2900000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building, in a deal reported to be worth around $1.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2010/12/03/wsj-google-has-bought-111-8th-avenue/|title=WSJ: Google Is Buying 111 8th Avenue|date=December 3, 2010|author= Miller, Rich |publisher=datacenterknowledge.com| accessdate= December 3, 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101230211144/http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2010/12/03/wsj-google-has-bought-111-8th-avenue/| archivedate= December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/nyregion/03building.html?_r=2&amp;ref=nyregion|title=Google Signs Deal To Buy Manhattan Office Building|author= Bagli, Charles V. |date=December 2, 2010| work = [[The New York Times]] |accessdate= December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's [[meet-me room]] in its carrier hotel was once the biggest in the city (the other big meet-me room is at [[60 Hudson Street]]).&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fBFTA61UoxEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=111+Eighth+Avenue+dark+fiber#v=onepage&amp;q=111%20Eighth%20Avenue%20dark%20fiber&amp;f=false |title=Optical Networks/WDM - Hui Pan, Editor - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

111 8th Avenue is adjacent to trunk [[dark fiber]] lines stretching from Hudson Street and continuing up Ninth Avenue.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;  That line at the time was owned by [[Lexent Metro Connect]].  There was speculation at the time of the acquisition that Google would use its strategic location to launch a [[Google Fiber]] operation in New York City. The Google Fiber plan never came to pass and Google has denied it has any plans to bring it to New York City anytime in the near future, although in 2013 it did begin offering free Wi-Fi to its Chelsea neighbors.  The Lexent dark fiber line has been acquired by [[Lightower Fiber Networks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alex Fitzpatrick |url=http://mashable.com/2013/01/08/google-nyc-wifi/ |title=Google Rolls Out Biggest Free Wi-Fi Network in New York City |publisher=Mashable.com |date=January 8, 2013 |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the first class of the newly created [[Cornell NYC Tech]] school began classes in the building, in space donated by Google.  Classes continued in the building until the school moved to its new location on [[Roosevelt Island]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tech.cornell.edu/news/cornell-tech-campus-opens-on-roosevelt-island-marking-transformational-mile "Cornell Tech Campus Opens on Roosevelt Island"] (Sept 12, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the massive size of the acquisition, Google has still found itself having to rent space elsewhere because it has been unable to break the leases with some of its tenants, including [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Deutsch Inc.]], and [[Bank of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geiger |first=Daniel |url=http://commercialobserver.com/2012/06/nike-to-google-at-111-8th-drop-dead/ |title=Nike to Google: Just Drop Dead |publisher=The Commercial Observer |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After years of renting additional space across the street in the [[Chelsea Market]], Google purchased that building in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blog.google/topics/inside-google/furthering-our-new-york-investment/ "Furthering our New York investment"] (March 20, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nexus one screen microscope.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Magnified image of the AMOLED screen on the [[Nexus One]] smartphone using the RGBG system of the [[PenTile matrix family]]]]
'''AMOLED''' ('''active-matrix organic light-emitting diode''', {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|oʊ|ˌ|l|ɛ|d}}) is a [[display device]] technology used in [[smartwatch]]es, [[mobile device]]s, laptops, and televisions. [[OLED]] describes a specific type of thin-film-display technology in which [[organic compound]]s form the [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] material, and [[active matrix]] refers to the technology behind the addressing of [[pixel]]s.

{{as of|2008}}, AMOLED technology was used in mobile phones, media players and digital cameras&lt;ref name="Auto21-1"/&gt; and continued to make progress toward low-power, low-cost and large-size (for example, 40-inch or 100-centimeter) applications.&lt;ref name="Auto21-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto21-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto21-4"/&gt;{{POV statement|date=May 2015}}{{Update inline|date=October 2016}}
[[File:Samsung Galaxy (RGB).jpg|thumb|250px|AMOLED used in some [[Samsung Galaxy]] smartphones]]

== Design ==
[[File:AMOLED-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Schematic of an active-matrix OLED display]]
An AMOLED display consists of an [[active matrix]] of [[OLED]] pixels generating light (luminescence) upon electrical activation that have been deposited or integrated onto a [[thin-film transistor]] (TFT) array, which functions as a series of switches to control the current flowing to each individual [[pixel]].&lt;ref name="Auto21-5"/&gt;

Typically, this [[continuous current]] flow is controlled by at least two TFTs at each pixel (to trigger the luminescence), with one TFT to start and stop the charging of a storage [[capacitor]] and the second to provide a [[voltage]] source at the level needed to create a constant current to the pixel, thereby eliminating the need for the very high currents required for [[passive matrix addressing|passive-matrix]] OLED operation.&lt;ref name="Auto21-6"/&gt;

TFT [[backplane]] technology is crucial in the fabrication of AMOLED displays. In AMOLEDs, the two primary TFT backplane technologies, [[polycrystalline silicon]] (poly-Si) and [[amorphous silicon]] (a-Si), are currently used offering the potential for directly fabricating the active-matrix backplanes at low temperatures (below 150&amp;nbsp;°C)  onto flexible plastic substrates for producing [[organic light-emitting diode roll-up display|flexible]] AMOLED displays.&lt;ref name="prin"/&gt;

== Disadvantages ==

Red and green OLED films have longer lifespans compared to blue OLED films. This variation results in color shifts as a particular pixel fades faster than the other pixels. This is amplified with the effect of pixel burn-in, and that blue pixels are used very frequently.&lt;ref name="Version Daily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.versiondaily.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-amoled-display-technology/|title=Advantages and disadvantages of AMOLED|publisher=Version Daily|date=2015-12-03|accessdate=2015-12-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120002646/http://www.versiondaily.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-amoled-display-technology/|archivedate=20 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMOLED displays are prone to [[screen burn-in]], which leaves a permanent imprint of overused colors represented by overused images. This usually only happens if the screen is used at maximum brightness the majority of the time for a long time.&lt;ref name="Version Daily"/&gt;

== Future development ==
Manufacturers have developed in-cell touch panels, integrating the production of capacitive sensor arrays in the AMOLED module fabrication process. In-cell sensor AMOLED fabricators include [[AU Optronics]] and [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]]. Samsung has marketed its version of this technology as "Super AMOLED". Researchers at [[DuPont]] used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software to optimize coating processes for a new solution-coated AMOLED display technology that is competitive in cost and performance with existing [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) technology. Using custom modeling and analytic approaches, Samsung has developed short and long-range film-thickness control and uniformity that is commercially viable at large glass sizes.&lt;ref name="Auto21-7"/&gt;

== Comparison to other technologies ==
AMOLED displays provide higher refresh rates than passive-matrix,{{Nonspecific|date=November 2011}} often reducing the response time to less than a millisecond, and they consume significantly less [[electric power|power]].&lt;ref name="Auto21-8"/&gt; This advantage makes active-matrix OLEDs well-suited for portable electronics, where power consumption is critical to battery life.

The amount of power the display consumes varies significantly depending on the color and brightness shown. As an example, one commercial [[QVGA]] OLED display consumes 0.3 watts while showing white text on a black background, but more than 0.7 watts showing black text on a white background, while an LCD may consume only a constant 0.35 watts regardless of what is being shown on screen.&lt;ref name="powerOLED"/&gt; Because the black pixels turn completely off, AMOLED also has contrast ratios that are significantly higher than LCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.androidauthority.com/amoled-vs-lcd-differences-572859/|title=AMOLED vs LCD: differences explained|website=Android Authority|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227012435/http://www.androidauthority.com/amoled-vs-lcd-differences-572859/|archivedate=27 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMOLED displays may be difficult to view in direct sunlight compared with LCDs because of their reduced maximum brightness.&lt;ref name="Auto21-9"/&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} Samsung's ''Super AMOLED'' technology addresses this issue by reducing the size of gaps between layers of the screen.&lt;ref name="sam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto21-10"/&gt; Additionally, [[PenTile]] technology is often used for a higher resolution display while requiring fewer subpixels than needed otherwise, sometimes resulting in a display less sharp and more grainy than a non-PenTile display with the same resolution.

The organic materials used in AMOLED displays are very prone to degradation over a relatively short period of time, resulting in color shifts as one color fades faster than another, [[image persistence]], or [[screen burn-in#Plasma, LCD and OLED displays|burn-in]].&lt;ref name="Auto21-11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto21-12"/&gt;

As of 2010, demand for AMOLED screens was high and, due to supply shortages of the Samsung-produced displays, certain models of [[HTC Corporation|HTC]] smartphones were changed to use next-generation LCD displays from the Samsung-Sony joint-venture [[S-LCD|SLCD]] in the future.&lt;ref name="Auto21-13"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.androidpit.com/super-amoled-vs-retina-display |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907220537/http://www.androidpit.com/super-amoled-vs-retina-display |archivedate=7 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }} Construction of new production facilities in 2011 was expected to increase the production of AMOLED screens to cope with demand.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flagship smartphones sold as of December 2011 used either Super AMOLED or [[IPS panel]] premium LCD. Super AMOLED displays, such as the one on the [[Galaxy Nexus]] and [[Samsung Galaxy S III]] have often been compared to IPS panel premium LCDs, found in the [[iPhone 4S]], [[HTC One X]], and [[Nexus 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/amoled-vs-lcd-which-screen-is-best-for-your-phone/|title=AMOLED vs LCD: Which screen is best for your phone?|author=|date=29 August 2014|website=digitaltrends.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329044710/https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/amoled-vs-lcd-which-screen-is-best-for-your-phone/|archivedate=29 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="androidpit.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidpit.com/super-amoled-vs-retina-display|title=Smartphone screens explained: display types, resolutions and more - AndroidPIT|author=|date=|website=androidpit.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512050251/http://www.androidpit.com/super-amoled-vs-retina-display|archivedate=12 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/11/02/nexus-4-review-not-exactly-perfect-but-close-enough-for-me/|title=Nexus 4 Review: Not Exactly Perfect, But Close Enough For Me – TechCrunch|author=|date=|website=techcrunch.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207110037/https://techcrunch.com/2012/11/02/nexus-4-review-not-exactly-perfect-but-close-enough-for-me/|archivedate=7 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to [[ABI Research]] the AMOLED display found in the [[Motorola Moto X]] draws just 92 mA during bright conditions and 68 mA while dim.&lt;ref name="abiresearch.com"&gt;[https://www.abiresearch.com/press/googlemotorola-mobility-display-a-bright-efficient Google/Motorola Mobility Display a Bright Efficient Future], ABI Research&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, compared with the IPS, the yield rate of AMOLED is low; the cost is also higher.

== Marketing terms ==
[[File:Galaxy Note II subpixels representation.png|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Galaxy Note II]] subpixels representation, based on 400X image of the Note II display&lt;ref name="Auto21-20"/&gt;]]

=== Super AMOLED ===
"Super AMOLED" is a marketing term created by device manufacturers for an AMOLED display with an integrated [[digitizer]]: the layer that detects touch is integrated into the screen, rather than overlaid on top of it. The display technology itself is not improved. According to Samsung, Super AMOLED reflects one-fifth as much sunlight as the first generation AMOLED.&lt;ref name="Auto21-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto21-16"/&gt; Super AMOLED is part of the Pentile matrix family, sometimes abbreviated as SAMOLED. For the [[Samsung Galaxy S III]], which reverted to Super AMOLED instead of the pixelation-free conventional RGB (non-[[PenTile]]) Super AMOLED Plus of its predecessor [[Samsung Galaxy S II]], the S III's larger screen size encourages users to hold the phone further from their face to obscure the PenTile effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sakr|first=Sharif|title=Samsung Galaxy S III review|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/05/25/samsung-galaxy-s-iii-review/|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=February 6, 2013|date=25 March 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126002229/http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/25/samsung-galaxy-s-iii-review/|archivedate=26 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Super AMOLED Advanced ===
Super AMOLED Advanced is a term marketed by [[Motorola]] to describe a brighter display than Super AMOLED screens, but also a higher resolution&amp;nbsp;— qHD or 960×540 for Super AMOLED Advanced than WVGA or 800×480 for Super AMOLED and 25% more energy efficient. Super AMOLED Advanced features [[PenTile matrix family|PenTile]], which sharpens subpixels in between pixels to make a higher resolution display, but by doing this, some picture quality is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oled-info.com/super-amoled-advanced|title=Super AMOLED Advanced.|accessdate=March 24, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324231743/http://www.oled-info.com/super-amoled-advanced|archivedate=24 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This display type is used on the [[Droid Razr|Motorola Droid RAZR]] and [[HTC One S]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motorola.com/us/consumers/DROID-RAZR-BY-MOTOROLA/78281,en_US,pd.html?selectedTab=tab-2&amp;cgid=mobile-phones#tab|title=DROID RAZR&amp;nbsp;– Thinnest 4G LTE Android Smartphone&amp;nbsp;– Motorola Mobility LLC.

=== Super AMOLED Plus ===
[[File:Samsung I9100.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Samsung Galaxy S II]], with a Super AMOLED Plus screen]]
Super AMOLED Plus, first introduced with the [[Samsung Galaxy S II]] and [[Samsung Droid Charge]] smartphones, is a branding from [[Samsung]] where the [[PenTile]] RGBG pixel matrix (2 subpixels) used in Super AMOLED displays has been replaced with a traditional RGB RGB (3 subpixels) arrangement typically used in [[LCD]]s. This variant of AMOLED is brighter and therefore more energy efficient than Super AMOLED displays&lt;ref name="Auto21-17"/&gt; and produces a sharper, less grainy image because of the increased number of subpixels. In comparison to AMOLED and Super AMOLED displays, they are even more energy efficient and brighter. However, Samsung cited screen life and costs by not using Plus on the Galaxy S II's successor, the [[Samsung Galaxy S III]].&lt;ref name="androidpit.com"/&gt;

=== HD Super AMOLED ===
HD Super AMOLED is a branding from Samsung for an HD-resolution (above 1280×720) Super AMOLED display. The first device to use it was the [[Samsung Galaxy Note (original)|Samsung Galaxy Note]]. The [[Galaxy Nexus]] and the [[Galaxy S III]] both implement the HD Super AMOLED with a PenTile RGBG-matrix (2 subpixels/pixel), while the [[Galaxy Note II]] uses an RBG matrix (3 subpixels/pixel) but not in the standard 3 stripe arrangement.&lt;ref name="Auto21-20"/&gt;

=== HD Super AMOLED Plus ===
A variant of the Samsung Galaxy S3 using [[Tizen]] OS 1 was benchmarked using a non-pentile HD Super AMOLED Plus screen in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/09/22/wifi-alliance-certificate-teases-tizen-flavored-galaxy-s3/|title=WiFi Alliance certificate teases Tizen flavored Samsung Galaxy S III|author=|date=|website=engadget.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011230323/https://www.engadget.com/2012/09/22/wifi-alliance-certificate-teases-tizen-flavored-galaxy-s3/|archivedate=11 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Full HD Super AMOLED ===
As featured on the [[Samsung Galaxy S4]], [[Samsung Galaxy S5]], and [[Samsung Galaxy Note 3]], this display has a 1920×1080 resolution that is better known as [[1080p]]. It has a color gamut of up to 97% of the [[Adobe RGB color space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sammyhub.com/2013/06/10/ul-certifies-samsungs-full-hd-amoled-display/|title=UL certifies Samsung's Full HD AMOLED Display - Sammy Hub|author=|date=10 June 2013|website=sammyhub.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113060113/https://sammyhub.com/2013/06/10/ul-certifies-samsungs-full-hd-amoled-display/|archivedate=13 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.displaymate.com/Galaxy_S4_ShootOut_1.htm|title=Galaxy S4 Display Technology Shoot-Out|author=|date=|website=www.displaymate.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003193544/http://www.displaymate.com/Galaxy_S4_ShootOut_1.htm|archivedate=3 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quad HD Super AMOLED ===
Quad HD Super AMOLED technology was first used by [[AU Optronics]] in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidauthority.com/quad-hd-amoled-au-optronics-367542/|title=The first Quad HD AMOLED screen is here, but it’s not from Samsung|author=|date=11 April 2014|website=androidauthority.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816021356/http://www.androidauthority.com/quad-hd-amoled-au-optronics-367542/|archivedate=16 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After AU Optronics released their phone which used a Quad HD Super AMOLED screen, other companies such as [[Samsung]] released phones utilizing the technology such as the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 4]] and [[Samsung Galaxy Note 5]] Broadband LTE-A and [[Samsung Galaxy S6]] and [[Samsung Galaxy S7|S7]].

== Future ==
Future displays exhibited from 2011 to 2013 by Samsung have shown flexible, 3D, unbreakable, transparent Super AMOLED Plus displays using very high resolutions and in varying sizes for phones. These unreleased prototypes use a polymer as a substrate removing the need for glass cover, a metal backing, and touch matrix, combining them into one integrated layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/12/05/samsung-teases-flexible-transparent-display-in-concept-video/|title=Samsung teases flexible, transparent display in concept video|author=|date=|website=engadget.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011230335/https://www.engadget.com/2011/12/05/samsung-teases-flexible-transparent-display-in-concept-video/|archivedate=11 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So far, Samsung plans on branding the newer displays as Youm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/01/09/samsung-names-flexible-oled-display-series-youm-shows-prototype/|title=Samsung names flexible OLED display series 'Youm', shows new prototype handheld device|author=|date=|website=engadget.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216205237/https://www.engadget.com/2013/01/09/samsung-names-flexible-oled-display-series-youm-shows-prototype/|archivedate=16 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or y-octa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2018/01/21/samsung-galaxy-s9-specs-design-price-release-date-galaxy-s9-plus/#38c4c7e1577c|title=Samsung Report 'Confirms' Significant Galaxy S9 Design Changes|first=Gordon|last=Kelly|date=|website=forbes.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401213743/https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2018/01/21/samsung-galaxy-s9-specs-design-price-release-date-galaxy-s9-plus/#38c4c7e1577c|archivedate=1 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also planned for the future are 3D stereoscopic displays that use eye tracking (via stereoscopic front-facing cameras) to provide full resolution 3D visuals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4347">'''Aircruise''' is a concept hydrogen [[airship]] envisioned as the combination of [[cruise ship]] and luxury [[hotel]],&lt;ref name="cleantech"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cleantech.com/news/5596/seymourpowell-unveils-eco-friendly |title=Seymourpowell unveils eco-friendly Aircruise design |access-date=2010-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205070213/http://cleantech.com/news/5596/seymourpowell-unveils-eco-friendly |archive-date=2010-02-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; designed by the UK company [[Seymourpowell]].  Its design director is Nick Talbot.  It has attracted the attention of [[Samsung C&amp;T|Samsung Construction and Trading]], for whom a concept video was produced.&lt;ref name="cleantech"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seymourpowell"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.seymourpowell.com/aircruise/aircruise-press-release.html |title=Seymourpowell introduces the Aircruise - a clipper in the clouds |access-date=2010-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206110817/http://www.seymourpowell.com/aircruise/aircruise-press-release.html |archive-date=2010-02-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that the concept was a [[publicity stunt]] by Seymourpowell, and nothing like this concept could ever work.&lt;ref name="net"&gt;[http://www.airships.net/blog/hydrogen-airship-nonsense]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
The Aircruise would be a solar and hydrogen [[fuel cell]]-powered airship.&lt;ref name="inhab"&gt;[http://www.inhabitat.com/2010/02/03/fuel-cell-powered-luxury-aircruise-designed-for-zero-emissions-travel/ The Aircruise: A Sustainable and Luxurious Way to Travel]&lt;/ref&gt; According to its design specifications, it would be {{convert|265|m|abbr=on}} tall containing {{convert|330000|m3|abbr=on}} of air and would carry a [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] of {{convert|396|t|abbr=on}}. It was "designed" to carry about 100 passengers with a flight crew of 6, 2 of whom are flight engineers, and another 14 supporting staff to look after passengers,&lt;ref name="NewsAu"&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/the-aircruise-may-herald-a-new-era-in-travel/story-e6frfq80-1225826631977 News Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; for a total of 20 crew.&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1248159/Aircruise-touted-scenic-new-millennium-luxury-ships-floating-U-S-37-hours.html Flying to New York? Then why not go by luxury airship (but it will take you 37 hours)]&lt;/ref&gt;

It would have glass floors for passengers to view the land and sea beneath.&lt;ref name="Gizmodo"&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/5463185/ Aircruise From London To New York In 37hrs (In Concept-Land Only)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its land speed would depend on the wind, but it would supposedly be capable of traveling at {{convert|100|to|150|km/h|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="NewsAu"/&gt; in calm conditions, sufficient to travel from [[London]] to [[New York City|New York]] in 37 hours and from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Hong Kong]]&lt;ref name="inhab"/&gt; or [[Shanghai]]&lt;ref name="dailymail"/&gt; in 4 days.

Its maximum altitude was {{convert|12000|ft|abbr=on}}, and it was "specified" that it could fly at an altitude of about 300 feet for sightseeing.&lt;ref name="dailymail"/&gt;

==Critical response==
The Aircruise concept received generally favourable criticism, much to the embarrassment of reporters when the hoax was revealed. For example, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' stated that it could herald a new era of luxury travel.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/picturegalleries/7139342/Aircruise-giant-hydrogen-airships-could-herald-a-new-era-in-luxury-travel.html Aircruise: giant hydrogen airships could herald a new era in luxury travel]&lt;/ref&gt;  Coverage in ''The Scotsman'' welcomed it as attractive for its environmental friendliness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/uk/39Slow-is-the-new-fast39.6036945.jp 'Slow is the new fast' say the designers of cutting edge airship]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eco friend===
Ordinary cruise ships release 3 times as much greenhouse gas as a [[Boeing 747]] per passenger and 36 times as much as the [[Eurostar]].&lt;ref name="cleantech"/&gt;  The Aircruise was thus claimed to be an eco friendly alternative, with its zero emission design.&lt;ref name="cleantech"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inhab"/&gt;

'''Arnold Ferdinand Arnold''' (February 6, 1921 - January 20, 2012) was an [[author]], [[game design]]er and [[cyberneticist]], known more for the fame of his relatives and wives in later life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/culture-magazines/arnold-arnold-f&lt;/ref&gt; His first and only legal wife, [[Eve Arnold]], was known for photography. His second partner, who he never married, was writer [[Gail E. Haley]]. Arnold's two brothers-in-law were [[Theodor Gaster]] and [[Peter Drucker]].

==Career==
Arnold followed his eldest sister to the United States where he gained work as a writer and cartoonist. He was drafted into the U.S. military in 1941, and after training in South Carolina, was sent to France as a member of the 101st Infantry division. Badly wounded after his [[jeep]] ran over a German landmine, he returned to New York where he settled down to married life with Eve.

By the 1950s, Arnold was well established in the New York literary world. He taught at the New School, had a one-man show at [[Museum of Modern Art|MOMA]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/1772/releases/MOMA_1953_0102_85.pdf?2010&lt;/ref&gt; and published his first book with acquaintance, [[Ian Ballantine]]. The success of the book, ''How To Play With Your Child'', which sold over 100,000 initial copies, established Arnold as an author, and allowed the family to buy a house in [[Long Island Sound]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.abebooks.co.uk/PLAY-CHILD-Arnold-Ballantine-Books-New/8153429937/bd&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnold was also a successful and well known advertising and commercial designer, and created the famous [[Parker Brothers]] swirl logo, first used in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ziYCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=arnold+parker+brothers+logo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimktKu8pzTAhXDZCYKHXmhBUUQ6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=arnold%20parker%20brothers%20logo&amp;f=false|title=American Trademark Designs: A Survey with 732 Marks, Logos, and Corporate-identity Symbols|last=Baer|first=Barbara|last2=Capitman|first2=Barbara Baer|date=1976-01-01|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486232591|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He created and designed many innovative educational and teaching games for leading game designers through the 1960s. He also designed classical record covers for EPIC Records during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bedales.org.uk/sites/default/files/14834-bedales-association-and-old-bedalian-newsletter-2013.pdf|title=BEDALES ASSOCIATION and OLD BEDALIAN NEWSLETTER 2013|last=|first=|date=2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this time that he also began to help his wife, Eve, establish herself as a photographer. They had one son. In 1961, they sold their house in Long Island, and Eve moved with their son to England. By 1965, however, Arnold had not followed the family. Instead he met Gail E. Haley, then married to Joseph Haley and fell in love with her. She divorced her husband, but Eve refused to divorce Arnold.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Arnold and Gail had two children. Arnold had by this time established himself as a national columnist with The Chicago Tribune with a weekly column on childrearing called "Parents and Their Children."&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1961/12/26/page/38/article/parents-should-help-children-with-toys&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Arnold, Gail and their two children moved to England. Arnold was increasingly distraught over the direction of U.S. politics and publicly spoke out and wrote against [[Richard Nixon]], which resulted in his being placed on Nixon's "[[enemies list]]."{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

During the 1980s and 90's, Arnold published several books, but never again had a financially successful career. He moved back to Petersfield in 1998, where his health rapidly declined. He died in 2012, from complications of [[sepsis]] and [[pneumonia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Locations==
Aspex Corporation maintains research and development and sales operations in [[Delmont, Pennsylvania|Delmont]], [[Pennsylvania]].

==History==
The origins of Aspex Corporation date back to 1992 (formally a division of [[RJ Lee Group]], Inc.) where developers recognized the limitations and costs associated with traditional scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  As a result, the company developed and introduced the world's first "personalized" SEM, or PSEM.  The timing of the introduction coincided with a number of important trends, including increased emphasis on materials characterization, the outsourcing of R&amp;D applications to service laboratories, and the "quality revolution" of the 1990s.  Since then, Aspex has continued to develop various industrialized SEMs for quality and process control purposes.

As of January 9, 2012, FEI Company purchased ASPEX from their privately held venture capitalists. After one year of operating under the name "ASPEX, an FEI Company", the stand-alone entity of ASPEX was absorbed by FEI and the electron microscopes produced in the Delmont, Pennsylvania facility are now grouped with the FEI offerings - under the newly created "ASPEX Product Group".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fei.com/aspex-product-group/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ASPEX is not operating as a stand-alone business entity, the three product lines (Express, Explorer and, Extreme) are still available for purchase with their automated software. This enables the user to engage the SEM (with EDX, if equipped) to automatically scan an area of interest about a sample and collect particulate information. Such information includes: Morphology, Thumbnail image, Chemistry (if EDX is equipped) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fei.com/industrial-manufacturing/wear-debris-characterization/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15949">The '''Advanced Reentry Demonstrator''' ('''ARD''') was a [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) suborbital reentry vehicle. It was developed and operated for experimental purposes, specifically to validate the multiple reentry technologies integrated upon it and the vehicle's overall design, as well as to gain greater insight into the various phenomenon encountered during reentry.

The ARD only performed a single spaceflight. On 21 October 1998, the vehicle was launched upon the third flight of the [[Ariane 5]] [[expendable launch system]]. Reaching a recorded altitude of 830&amp;nbsp;km, the ARD was performed a guided reentry back to [[Earth]] before splashing down relatively close to its intended target point in the [[Pacific Ocean]] after one hour and 41 minutes of flight. Following its recovery and subsequent analysis, the vehicle was found to have performed well, the nose cone and heat shield thermal protection having remaining in an ideal state and having remained completely airtight and perfectly intact.

The ARD held the distinction of being the very first guided sub-orbital reentry vehicle to be manufactured, launched and recovered by Europe.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"&gt;Tran, Phillipe., J.C. Paulat and P. Boukhobza. [http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a476493.pdf "Re-entry Flight Experiments Lessons Learned – The Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator ARD."] ''[[Astrium|EADS Space Transportation]]'', 1 June 2007. OMB No. 0704-0188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt; One of the core purposes of the mission was the gathering of knowledge that could be subsequently used during the development of future re-entry vehicles and precise landing capabilities. In the aftermath of the programme, the ESA decided to embark on a follow-up reentry demonstrator, known as the [[Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle]] (IVX). The first IXV vehicle underwent its first successful test flight during February 2015. The ARD and IVX demonstrators are intended to serve as developmental stepping stones towards a series of production-standard [[spaceplane]]s.

==Development==
From the 1980s onwards, there was growing international interest in the development of reusable spacecraft; at this time, only the [[superpower]]s of the era, the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], had developed this capability.&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt; European nations such as Britain and France embarked on their own national programmes to produce [[spaceplane]]s, such as [[HOTOL]] and [[Hermes (spacecraft)|Hermes]], while attempting to attract the backing of the multinational [[European Space Agency]] (ESA). While these programmes ultimately did not garner enough support to continue development, there was still demand within a number of the ESA's member states to pursue the development of reusable space vehicles.&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt; Accordingly, shortly after the abandonment of the Hermes programme, it was decided to conduct a technology demonstrator programme with the aim of producing a vehicle which would support the development of subsequent reusable spacecraft. The ESA later referred to this programme, which became known as the Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator (ARD), as being: "major step towards developing and operating space transportation vehicles that can return to Earth... For the first time, Europe will fly a complete space mission – launching a vehicle into space and recovering it safely."&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt;

The ARD was developed and operated as a cooperative civilian space programme under the oversight of the ESA; it fell within the agency's Manned Space Transportation Program (MSTP) framework.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt; Under this framework, the programme was pursued with a pair of expressed principal objectives. First, the ESA was keen to perform a demonstration of the ability of the European space industry to design and produce low-cost reentry vehicles, as well as its ability to handle the critical mission phases involved in their operation, such as sub-orbital flight, reentry and vehicle recovery.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt; In addition, the ARD was equipped with a comprehensive suite of sensors and recording equipment so that detailed measurements were obtained during testing; it was recognised that exploration of various phenomena across the successive phases of flight would be of high value. The data gained would be subsequently catalogued and harnessed during further programmes, especially future reentry vehicles and [[reusable launch system]]s.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt;

The prime contractor selected to perform the ARD's development and construction was French [[aerospace]] company [[Aérospatiale]] (which later merged into the multinational [[Astrium|EADS – SPACE Transportation]] group).&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt; During 1995 and 1996, multiple development studies exploring concepts for the shape of such a vehicle were conducted; ultimately, it was decided to adopt a configuration that resembled the classical manned [[Apollo spacecraft|Apollo capsule]] which had been previously operated by [[NASA]]. The use of an existing shape was a deliberate measure to avoid a length exploration of the craft's aerodynamic properties; both the dimensions and mass of the craft were also defined by the capabilities of the [[Ariane 5]] [[expendable launch system]] used to deploy the vehicle.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt;

It has been claimed that even early on, the programme schedule was relatively tight and funding was limited.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt; According to the ESA, the restrictive financing of the programme was an intentional effort, to prove that such a vehicle could be demonstrated with a smaller budget than previous efforts had been.&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt;

==Design==
The ARD is an unmanned 3-axis stabilised automated capsule which served as experimental reentry vehicle primarily for technology-proving and data-gathering purposes.&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"&gt;[http://cds.cern.ch/record/411209/files/cer-000338706.pdf "The Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator."] ''[[European Space Agency]]'', October 1998. BR-138.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of its shape, the vehicle bares an external resemblance to a 70 per cent-scale version of the American Apollo capsule, and considered by the ESA to be a 50 per cent-scale vehicle of a prospective potentially operational transportation vehicle; as such, it is 2.8 meters in diameter and weighs 2.8 tons at atmospheric interface point.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt; The ARD possesses an air- and water-tight [[Cabin pressurization|pressurised]] structure primarily composed of an [[aluminium]] [[alloy]], which is protected by a layer of Norcoat 62250 FI [[Cork (material)|cork]] [[Alloy|composite]] tiles across the exterior of nosecone and by an arrangement of [[aleastrasil]] [[silicon dioxide]]-[[phenol formaldehyde resin]] tiles over the [[heat shield]]. The vehicle itself can be divided into three distinct sections: the frontshield section, the rear-cone section and the backcover section.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt;

The ARD possesses manoeuvrability capabilities during re-entry; a favourable [[lift-to-drag ratio]] is achieved via an off-set [[center of gravity]].&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt; The guidance law is akin to that of Apollo and the [[Space Shuttle]], being based on a drag-velocity profile control and bank angles manoeuvres in order to conform with heating, load factor, rebound, and other required conditions; according to the ESA, this provided acceptable final guidance accuracy (within 5&amp;nbsp;km) with limited real-time calculation complexity. In operation, the guidance system becomes active once the aerodynamic forces become efficient and as long as the [[reaction control system]] remains efficient.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt; Instead of using [[flight control surfaces]], non-linear control is instead ensured by an assortment of seven [[hydrazine]] thrusters which, according to the manufacturer, were derived from the [[Ariane 5]] [[expendable launch system]]. These rocket thrusters, each typically generating 400-[[Newton (unit)|N]] of thrust, were arranged in a blow-down configuration and positioned so that three units provide [[Aircraft principal axes#Lateral axis .28pitch.29|pitch]] control, two for [[Aircraft principal axes#Longitudinal axis .28roll.29|roll]] and two for [[Aircraft principal axes#Vertical axis .28yaw.29|yaw]].&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt;

During its reentry into the atmosphere, the ARD’s heat shield is exposed to temperatures reaching as high as 2000&amp;nbsp;°C and a heat flux peaking at 1000&amp;nbsp;kW/m2, resulting from the [[ionisation]] of the atmosphere, which is in turn caused by the vehicle travelling at [[hypersonic speed]]s, in excess of 27,000&amp;nbsp;km/h during parts of its reentry descent.&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt; While the conical area of the vehicle may reach 1000&amp;nbsp;°C, with a heat flux of 90–125&amp;nbsp;kW/m2, the interior temperature will not rise above 40&amp;nbsp;°C. The thermal protection measures used were a combination of pre-existing materials that Aerospatiale had already developed under French military programmes along with multiple new-generation materials, the latter of which had been principally included for testing purposes.&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt; During reentry, the ARD's head shield loses only 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm of its thickness, keeping its aerodynamic shape relatively constant, which in turn simplifies the flight control algorithms.&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt;

The vehicle is equipped with a Descent Recovery System (DRS), deployed prior to splashdown in order to limit the impact loads and to ensure its flotation for up to 36 hours.&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt; This system involving the deployment of multiple [[parachute]]s, stored within the internal space of the tip of the nose cone; in total, one flat ribbon pilot chute, one conical ribbon drogue chute with a single reefing stage, and three slotted ribbon main parachutes with two reefing stages are typically deployed. For [[buoyancy]] purposes, a pair of inflatable balloons are also present in the DRS, helping to keep the vehicle upright.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt; To aid in its recovery, the ARD is furnished with both a satellite-based [[search and rescue]] [[Electric beacon|radio beacon]] and flashing light.&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt;

The internal space of the ARD and was packed with the most advanced technologies to test and qualify new technologies and flight control capabilities for atmospheric reentry and landing.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt; The avionics of the vehicle were primarily sourced from existing equipment used upon the Ariane 5 launcher. The guidance and navigation systems used a computerised [[inertial navigation system]] which, via a [[Bus (computing)|databus]], would be automatically corrected by [[GPS]] during the [[Ballistics|ballistic]] phase of flight. However, the ARD was designed to be tolerant to instances of GPS failure; this is achieved via a series of control loop algorithms that verify the GPS-derived data to be within a pre-established ‘credibility window’, defined by the inertial navigation readings.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt; During the vehicle's sole mission, it continuously recorded and transmitted to the ground in excess of 200 critical parameters that were used to analyse the ARD's flight performance as well as the behaviour of the equipment on board.&lt;ref name = "ARD ESA"/&gt;

==Operational history==
The ARD only performed a single spaceflight. On 21 October 1998, the ARD was launched upon the third flight of the [[Ariane 5]] [[expendable launch system]].&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt; It was released shortly after separation of the launcher's cryogenic main stage (at an altitude of about 216&amp;nbsp;km) 12 minutes after lift-off from the [[Centre Spatial Guyanais|Guiana Space Centre]], Europe's spaceport in [[Kourou, French Guiana]]. The ARD attained a recorded altitude of 830&amp;nbsp;km, after which a guided reentry into the atmosphere was conducted. It splashed down to within 4.9&amp;nbsp;km of its target point in the [[Pacific Ocean]] between the [[Marquesas Islands]] and [[Hawaii]] after one hour and 41 minutes of flight.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt;

The ARD was recovered roughly five hours following splash down. Following recovery, the vehicle was transported back to Europe and subject to detailed technical analysis in order to acquire more information on its performance. Engineers analysing data from its sub-orbital flight reported that all the capsule's systems had performed well and according to expectations; analysis of the craft's real-time [[telemetry]] broadcast during the flight had also reported that all electrical equipment and propulsion systems functioned nominally. The onboard telemetry systems and reception stations had all performed well, and the onboard [[GPS]] receiver worked satisfactorily during the entire flight except, as expected, during black-out in reentry.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt;

Following post-mission analysis of the ARD's performance, it was announced that all of the demonstration and system requirements of the programme had been successfully achieved.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt; The test flight itself was described as having been "nearly nominal", particularly the trajectory and flight control aspects; additionally, many of the onboard systems, such as the navigation (primary and backup), propulsion, thermal protection, communication, and DRS were found to have performed either as predicted or to have been outside these predictions by only a small margin.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt; During reentry, the [[heat shield]] temperature reached a recorded peak temperature of 900&amp;nbsp;°C; nevertheless, both the vehicle's cone and heat shield thermal protection were found in a perfect state following its retrieval.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt;

Issues highlighted during analysis included the role of design uncertainties having led to difficulties in observing some physical phenomena such as real gas effects, addressing aerothermal environment characterization was also hindered due to the premature failure of some [[thermocouple]]s. Overall, the flight was stated to have brought a great amount of high quality aerodynamic information back which, amongst other benefits, served to confirm and enhance the capabilities of ground-based prediction tools.&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt; Since its retrieval and the conclusion of post-mission examination, the sole ARD vehicle itself has been preserved and has become a publicly-accessible exhibit at the [[European Space Research and Technology Centre]] in [[Noordwijk]], [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name = "ARD leslear"/&gt;

Cartoning machines can be divided into two types:
* Horizontal cartoning machines
* Vertical cartoning machines

A cartoning machine which picks a single piece from stack of folded carton and erects it, fills with a product or bag of products or number of products horizontally through an open end and closes by tucking the end flaps of the carton or applying glue or adhesive. The product might be pushed in the carton either through the mechanical sleeve or by [[Compressed air|pressurized air]]. For many applications however, the products are inserted into the carton manually. This type of Cartoning machine is widely used for packaging [[food]]stuffs, [[confectionery]], [[Pharmaceutical drug|medicine]], [[cosmetics]], sundry goods, etc.

A cartoning machine which erects a folded carton, fills with a product or number of products vertically through an open end and closes by either tucking the end flaps of the carton or applying glue or adhesive, is called an end load cartoning machine.&lt;ref name=Delkor&gt;Delkor Media Library.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7018">The [[United States Army]]'s '''Command Post of the Future'''  (CPOF) is a [[C4ISTAR|C2]] software system that allows commanders to maintain topsight over the battlefield; collaborate with superiors, peers and subordinates over live data; and communicate their intent.

Originally a [[DARPA]] technology demonstration, in 2006 CPOF became an Army Program of Record.  It is managed by the Product Manager Tactical Mission Command at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], [[Maryland]], and integrated with the Army's [[Project Manager Battle Command#Maneuver Control System (MCS)|Maneuver Control System]] and other products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; The prime contractor on the CPOF program is [[General Dynamics]] C4 Systems, which purchased the original developer of the software (MAYA Viz Ltd) in 2005.

== Overview ==
CPOF began as a DARPA investigation to improve mission command using networked [[information visualization]] systems, with the goal of doubling the speed and quality of command decisions. The system was developed in a research setting by Global Infotek, Inc.; ISX Corporation (now part of Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories); Oculus Info, Inc. (now called Uncharted Software Inc.); SYS Technologies, Inc.; and MAYA Viz (now part of General Dynamics C4 Systems) with the active participation of military personnel as subject matter experts.

CPOF is one of [[List of collaborative software|several examples]] of [[collaborative software]], but intended specifically for use in a mission command. A shared workspace is the main interface, in which every interface element in CPOF is a shared piece of data in a networked repository.  Shared visual elements in CPOF include iconic representations of hard data, such as units, events, and tasks; visualization frameworks such as maps or schedule charts on which those icons appear; and brush-marks, ink-strokes, highlighting, notes and other annotation.

All visual elements in CPOF are interactive via [[drag-and-drop]] gestures.  Users can drag data-elements and annotation from any visualization framework into any other (i.e., from a chart to a table), which reveal different data-attributes in context depending on the visualization used.  Most data-elements can be grouped and nested via drag-and-drop to form associations that remain with the data in all of its views.  Drag-and-drop composition on live visualizations is CPOF's primary mechanism for editing data values, such as locations on a map or tasks on a schedule (for example, moving an event-icon on a map changes the lat/lon values of that event in the shared repository; moving a task icon on a schedule changes its time-based values in the shared repository).  The results of editing gestures are conveyed in real-time to all observers and users of a visualization; when one user moves an event on a map, for example, that event-icon moves on all maps and shared views, such that all users see its new location immediately.  Data inputs from warfighters are conveyed to all collaborators as the "natural" result of a drop-gesture in-situ, requiring no explicit publishing mechanism.

CPOF is also used as a live-data alternative to PowerPoint briefings. During a CPOF briefing, commanders can drill into any data element in a high-level view to see details on demand, and view outliers or other elements of interest in different visual contexts without switching applications.  Annotations and editing-gestures made during briefings become part of the shared repository.  The commander's topsight is based on ground-truth at the moment of the briefing; the commander can then communicate intent on live data.

CPOF users at any level can assemble workspaces out of smaller tool-and-appliance primitives, allowing members of a collaborating group to organize their workflows according to their needs, without affecting or disrupting the views of other users. CPOF's Tool-and-appliance primitives are designed to let users create quick, throw-away mini-applications to meet their needs in-situ, supporting on-the-fly uses of the software that no developer or designer could have anticipated.

The CPOF software is based on the [[CoMotion]] platform, a proprietary commercial framework for building collaborative [[information visualization]] systems and domain-independent "decision communities".  CoMotion's design principles originated as a research program at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] led by Steven Roth, and was subsequently developed at MAYA Viz Ltd and General Dynamics C4 Systems.

== Operational details ==
CPOF uses a proprietary [[navigational database|navigational style database]] based on [[U-form]]s to store, represent, and operate upon a wide variety of types of data.  CPOF can receive real-time or near-real-time data from a variety of standard sources—such as [[GCCS-A]], C2PC, and [[Army Battle Command System|ABCS]]—and display them using [[MIL-STD-2525B]] symbols on maps and charts.  Plans, schedules, notes, briefings, and other battle-related information can be composed and shared between warfighters.  All maps, charts, pasteboards, and other work products can be marked up with permanent and/or fading ink, and annotated with text or "stickies" to provide further context.  A VOIP solution is included, although it can integrate with a pre-existing voice solution.

Fault tolerance for low bandwidth, high latency, and/or error-prone TCP/IP networks is supported by CPOF's multi-tiered client-server architecture.  It can thus be deployed on systems from a two-hop geosynchronous satellite link to a radio network such as JNN while remaining collaborative.  The software is largely Java-based, but is only currently deployed on a Microsoft Windows platform.

== Deployment ==
CPOF was first deployed operationally in a handful of locations in Baghdad, Iraq by the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division of the US Army]] in 2004, and was subsequently deployed throughout Iraq and Afghanistan and used by coalition forces.  Variants of CPOF have participated in [[United States Joint Forces Command]]'s Urban Resolve 2015, the [[United States Air Force]]'s Joint Expeditionary Force Experiment 06 and 08, and has been in use by the Marines in Combat Operation Centers since 2007.

CPOF became an official US Army program of record in 2006.

'''Correction paper''', or '''correction film''', its plastic based equivalent, is a tab of [[plastic]] with one side [[coated paper|coated]] with white correction material. It is used to correct [[typing error]]s made when using a [[typewriter]]. When inserted between the [[paper]] and the ribbon, the impression of the typebar presses the shape of the character into the film, which prints the white correction material onto the paper, hiding the erroneous [[Glyph|character]] and preparing the [[document]] for the correct character.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4897">[[File:Delay locked loop.png|thumb]]
In electronics, a '''delay-locked loop''' (DLL) is a digital circuit similar to a [[phase-locked loop]] (PLL), with the main difference being the absence of an internal [[voltage-controlled oscillator]], replaced by a delay line.

A DLL can be used to change the phase of a clock signal (a signal with a [[periodic function|periodic]] [[waveform]]), usually to enhance the ''clock rise''-to-''data output valid'' timing characteristics of [[integrated circuit]]s (such as [[dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] devices). DLLs can also be used for [[clock recovery]] (CDR). From the outside, a DLL can be seen as a negative-delay gate placed in the clock path of a digital circuit.

The main component of a DLL is a delay chain composed of many delay gates connected output-to-input. The input of the chain (and thus of the DLL) is connected to the clock that is to be negatively delayed. A multiplexer is connected to each stage of the delay chain; the selector of this multiplexer is automatically updated by a control circuit to produce the negative delay effect. The output of the DLL is the resulting, negatively delayed clock signal.
[[File:Delay locked loop, 0th order type 0 and 1st order type 1.png|thumb|center|660px|&lt;center&gt;The delay locked loop is a variable delay line whose delay is locked to the duration of the period of a reference clock.&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on the signal processing element in the loop (a flat amplifier or an integrator),&lt;br /&gt;the DLL loop can be of 0th order type 0 or of 1st order type 1.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Another way to view the difference between a DLL and a PLL is that a DLL uses a variable phase (=delay) block where a PLL uses a variable frequency block.

A DLL compares the phase of its last output with the input clock to generate an error signal which is then integrated and fed back as the control to all of the delay elements.
The integration allows the error to go to zero while keeping the control signal, and thus the delays, where they need to be for phase lock. Since the control signal directly impacts the phase this is all that is required.

A PLL compares the phase of its oscillator with the incoming signal to generate an error signal which is then integrated to create a control signal for the [[voltage-controlled oscillator]]. The control signal impacts the frequency of the oscillator, and phase is the integral of frequency, so a second integration is unavoidably performed by the oscillator itself.

In the Control Systems jargon, the DLL is a loop one step lower in order and in type with respect to the PLL, because it lacks the 1/s factor in the controlled block: the delay line has a transfer function phase-out/phase-in that is just a constant, the VCO transfer function is instead G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;/s. In the comparison made in the previous sentences (that correspond to the figure where the integrator, and not the flat gain, is used), the DLL is a loop of 1st order and type 1 and the PLL of 2nd order and type 2. Without the integration of the error signal, the DLL would be 0th order and type 0 and the PLL 1st order and type 1.

The number of elements in the delay chain must be even, or else the [[w:Duty cycle|duty cycle]] of the clock at the intermediate nodes of the chain might become irregular.

If 2N +1 was the -odd- number of stages, a 50% duty-cycle would become at times N/(2N+1), at times (N+1)/(2N+1), following the jittering of the error signal around the value corresponding to perfect lock.

Calling 2N the number of stages of the DLL chain, it is easy to see that the figure above would change from a DLL to a PLL, locked to the same phase and frequency, if the following modifications were made:
* dividing by two the number of stages 
* making one of the stages an inverting one
*connecting the input of the chain of stages to its output instead of to the reference clock.
The resulting chain becomes a ring oscillator with a period equal to the delay of the previous chain, and the loop locks to the same reference clock with the same level of error signal. 

The loop order and type are both incremented by one.
It may be further remarked that, in the case where the integrator instead of the flat gain is chosen, the PLL that can be obtained is unstable. 

The phase shift can be specified either in absolute terms (in delay chain gate units), or as a proportion of the clock period, or both.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5897">The '''Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament''' ('''ENCD''') was sponsored by the [[United Nations]] in 1961. The ENCD considered [[disarmament]], confidence-building measures and nuclear test controls.&lt;ref name=uofmich&gt;"[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/endc/ Eighteen Nation Committee on Diarmament]", [[University of Michigan]], UM Digital Library Production Service, updated February 17, 2006, accessed June 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1965 and 1968, the ENCD negotiated the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]].

==History==
The [[United Nations General Assembly|United Nations (UN) General Assembly]] accepted the decision of the major powers to create the ENCD through resolution 1722 (XVI) on December 21, 1961. The ENCD began work on March 14, 1962 in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] and met regularly until August 26, 1969.&lt;ref name=legault/&gt;&lt;ref name=singh&gt;[[Nagendra Singh|Singh, Nagendra]] and [[Ted McWhinney|McWhinney, Edward]]. ''Nuclear Weapons and Contemporary International Law'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=r2IfMEpPUIsC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=Eighteen+Nation+Committee+on+Disarmament&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HI8MTIqXCIHKNb-_sLYE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Eighteen%20Nation%20Committee%20on%20Disarmament&amp;f=false Google Books link]), Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1989, p. 231, ({{ISBN|9024736374}}).&lt;/ref&gt; On that date the ENCD was reconstituted as the [[Conference of the Committee on Disarmament]] (CCD). The August 26 meeting of the ENCD was its 431st since its inception.&lt;ref name=legault&gt;LeGault, Albert and Fortman, Michel. ''A Diplomacy of Hope: Canada and Disarmament, 1945-1988'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=CkaV0twc93IC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=Eighteen+Nation+Disarmament+Committee&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=54UMTMjrJZPaNbmY0bUE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Eighteen%20Nation%20Disarmament%20Committee&amp;f=false Google Books link]), McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 1992, p. 197-98, ({{ISBN|0773509550}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the ENCD began work the Soviet Union submitted a draft treaty for consideration. The USSR Draft Treaty on General and Complete Disarmament under Strict International Control was submitted to the ENCD on March 15, 1962.&lt;ref name=singh/&gt; The Soviet draft treaty was an 18-point plan for disarmament in three stages which included [[nuclear disarmament]] and the creation of a UN special disarmament organization.&lt;ref name=mango&gt;[[Edmund Osmańczyk|Osmańczyk, Edmund Jan]] and Mango, Anthony. ''Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements: A to F'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=M734r1ZXW2cC&amp;pg=PA543&amp;dq=Eighteen+Nation+Committee+on+Disarmament&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ho8MTK7pB5HQM-vE1bUE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Eighteen%20Nation%20Committee%20on%20Disarmament&amp;f=false Google Books link]), Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003 p. 543,({{ISBN|0415939216}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The United States quickly countered with its own proposals on April 18, 1962.&lt;ref name=mango/&gt;

==Members==
The ENCD included the original members of the [[Ten Nation Committee on Disarmament]] (TNCD) as well as eight additional member nations.&lt;ref name=legault2/&gt; The ENCD actually only included the participation of seventeen nations, as France did not participate in an official capacity. However, they were involved in an unofficial role in consultations with the other Western representatives.&lt;ref name=legault/&gt;

Original members of TNCD: ([[Western Bloc]]) - [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]], [[Italy]], [[United States]]. ([[Eastern Bloc]]) - [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=legault2&gt;Legault, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nations added to ENCD: [[Brazil]], [[Burma]], [[Ethiopia]], [[India]], [[Mexico]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sweden]], [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR).&lt;ref name=legault/&gt;

==Results and legacy==
The ENCD (1962-69) was one of several predecessors to the current UN disarmament organization, the [[Conference on Disarmament]] (CD).&lt;ref name=unog&gt;"[http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/(httpPages)/2D415EE45C5FAE07C12571800055232B?OpenDocument Disarmament]", The United Nations Office at Geneva, United Nations, 2009, accessed June 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The ENCD followed the short-lived Ten Nation Committee on Disarmament (1960), and was succeeded by the CCD (1969-78) until the CD was formed in 1979.&lt;ref name=unog/&gt;

After the events of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1962 leaders in both [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Moscow]] found that communicating with each other was plagued with certain delay. In the aftermath of the crisis the ENCD presented a working paper titled "Measures to Reduce the Risk of War Through Accident, Miscalculation, or Failure of Communication". In the paper, the United States proposed a direct link of communication between Washington and Moscow. Though the Soviets had previously rejected such a link outside the framework of a larger disarmament agreement in April 1963 both sides announced a willingness to commit to such an agreement. The agreement, usually known as the "[[Moscow-Washington hotline|Hot Line Agreement]]" was signed and entered into force on June 20, 1963.&lt;ref name=blacker&gt;[[Coit D. Blacker|Blacker, Coit D.]], [[Gloria Duffy|Duffy, Gloria]], Stanford Arms Control Group.

{{nihongo|'''Elpida Memory, Inc.'''|エルピーダメモリ株式会社|Erupīda Memori Kabushiki-gaisha}} was a corporation established in 1999 that developed, designed, manufactured and sold [[dynamic random access memory|dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) products. It was also a [[Foundry (electronics)|semiconductor foundry]]. With headquarters in [[Yaesu]], [[Chūō, Tokyo]], [[Japan]], it was initially formed under the name NEC Hitachi Memory in 1999 by the merger of the [[Hitachi]] and [[NEC]] DRAM businesses. In the following year it took on the name Elpida.  In 2003, Elpida took over the [[Mitsubishi]] DRAM business. In 2004, it listed its shares in the first section of the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]]. In 2012, those shares were delisted as a result of its bankruptcy. In 2013, Elpida was acquired by [[Micron Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;Dylan McGrath, EETimes. "[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1319103 Micron Closes Elpida Acquisition]." July 31, 2013. Retrieved June 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Elpida Memory was founded in 1999 as a merger of NEC's and Hitachi's DRAM operation and began development operations for DRAM products in 2000.

In 2001, the company began construction of its 300mm wafer fabrication plant. Later that year, it began sales operations in domestic markets.

In 2003, the company took over [[Mitsubishi]] Electric Corporation's DRAM operations and employed Mitsubishi development engineers.

In 2004, Elpida Memory went public and was listed on the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]].

In 2006, the company established Akita Elpida to take on the development of advanced back-end technology processes.

In March 2006, Elpida reported consolidated sales of 241,500,000,000 [[Japanese yen]]. It employed 3196 people.

In 2002, armed with the Sherman Antitrust Act, the United States Department of Justice began a probe into the activities of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) manufacturers. US computer makers, including Dell and Gateway, claimed that inflated DRAM pricing was causing lost profits and hindering their effectiveness in the marketplace. To date, five manufacturers have pleaded guilty to their involvement in an [[DRAM price fixing|international price-fixing conspiracy]] including [[Hynix]], [[Infineon]], [[Micron Technology]], [[Samsung]], and Elpida. Micron Technology was not fined for its involvement due to co-operation with investigators.

The company received 140 billion yen in financial aid and loans from the Japanese government and banks during the financial crisis in 2009.&lt;ref name=bloomberg2012/&gt;

On April 3, 2010, Elpida Memory sold ¥18.5billion worth of shares to [[Kingston Technology]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantoday.com/category/technology/view/elpida-to-raise-y185-billion-via-share-sale-to-us-partner/ Elpida to raise Y18.5 billion via share sale to U.S. partner]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2010, Elpida announced it had developed the world's first four-gigabit DDR3 SDRAM. Based on a 40&amp;nbsp;nm process, this DRAM was said to use about thirty percent less power compared to two 40&amp;nbsp;nm process two-gigabit DDR3 SDRAMs. It was to operate at both standard DDR3 1.5&amp;nbsp;V and 1.35&amp;nbsp;V to further reduce power consumption.&lt;ref&gt; Phys.org.

Retrieved May 30, 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Elpida announced that it planned to raise $987 million by selling shares and bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-11/elpida-may-sell-987-million-of-shares-convertible-bonds-stock-tumbles.html |title=Elpida to Sell 79.7 Billion Yen in Shares, Convertible Bonds - Bloomberg|work=bloomberg.com |year=2011 |accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, Elpida claimed to be the first memory maker to begin sampling 25&amp;nbsp;nm DRAMs.&lt;ref&gt;EE Times.

A {{Nihongo|'''Futon dryer'''|布団乾燥機|futonkansōki}} is an [[electric device]] that warms and dries a Japanese [[futon]] by forcing warm air through it.

==Mechanism==

A futon dryer works by drawing in air with an electric fan and heating it, and then forcing it into a large cloth pouch.  The pouch is usually inserted between the futon mattress and comforter, and hot air is forced through it for about an hour to dry the futon.&lt;ref name="akinaiblog" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.akinaiblog.com/product/1916 |title=Panasonic Futon Dryer (Kansouki) |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Futon dryers run on a timer, and when the timer reaches zero, cold air is blown before the unit shuts off.  A futon drier uses about 600 watts of electricity, about the same as a hair drier.&lt;ref name="panasonic" /&gt;

==Purpose==
[[File:布団干し_(528985156).jpg|thumb|Futons hung out to dry]]
A futon must be kept dry because human sweat and body heat create a warm, moist environment which is amenable to [[mites]].  Traditionally futons are kept dry by hanging them out on a balcony in the sun to dry in the open air, but some people are too busy to do this since they must be hung during daylight hours and brought in before sunset, when the temperature drops and moisture condenses inside the futon.  Finding time to hang a futon may also be difficult during the [[East Asian rainy season|rainy season]] in Japan, since there are few sunny days and there are frequent and sudden periods of rain so a futon dryer can fulfill the function of keeping the futon dry and keeping the level of mites living in the futon down without needing to hang it out.&lt;ref name="gojapan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gojapan.about.com/cs/japanesefurniture/a/futon.htm |title=Introduction to Japanese Futon |publisher=about.com |accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many dryers also have attachments for drying shoes or boots, or air pouches which can be folded to dry clothes in place of a [[clothes dryer]].  The dryer can be run for under an hour to warm the futon without completely drying it, or over an hour to reduce the population of mites.&lt;ref name="panasonic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctlg.panasonic.jp/product/spec.do?pg=06&amp;hb=FD-F06A6 |title=ふとん乾燥機 FD-F06A6 |language=Japanese |accessdate=25 November 2010 |publisher=Panasonic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5863">'''Generic Bootstrapping Architecture''' ('''GBA''') is a technology that enables the authentication of a user. This authentication is possible if the user owns a valid identity on an HLR ([[GSM core network#Home location register .28HLR.29|Home Location Register]]) or on an HSS ([[Home Subscriber Server]]).

GBA is standardized at the [[3GPP]] (http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/33220.htm).  The user authentication is instantiated by a shared secret, one in the [[smartcard]], for example a [[SIM card]] inside the mobile phone and the other is on the HLR/HSS.

GBA authenticates by making a network component challenge the smartcard and verify that the answer is the one predicted by the HLR/HSS.

Instead of asking the service provider to trust the [[Bootstrapping Server Function|BSF]] and relying on it for every authentication request, the [[Bootstrapping Server Function|BSF]] establishes a shared secret between the [[simcard]] card and the service provider. This shared secret is limited in time and for a specific domain.

[[Image:Generic Bootstrapping Architecture.jpg]]

==Strong points==
This solution has some strong points of certificate and shared secrets without having some of their weaknesses: 
 
- There is no need for user enrollment phase nor secure deployment of keys, making this solution a very low cost one when compared to [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]].

- Another advantage is the ease with which the authentication method may be integrated into terminals and service providers, as it is based on [[HTTP]]'s well known "[[Digest access authentication]]". Every Web server already implement HTTP [[digest authentication]] and the effort to implement GBA on top of digest authentication is minimal. For example, it could be implemented on SimpleSAMLPhP http://rnd.feide.no/simplesamlphp with 500 PHP lines of code and only a few tens of lines of code are Service Provider specific making it really easy to port it to another Web site.

- On device side is needed: 
* A Web browser (in fact an HTTP client) implementing digest authentication and the special case designed by a "3gpp" string in the HTTP header.
* A means to dialog with a smartcard and signed the challenge sent by the BSF, either Bluetooth SAP or a Java or native application could be used to serve the request coming from the browser.

== Technical overview ==
Actually, contents in this section are from external literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tml.tkk.fi/Publications/C/22/papers/Olkkonen_final.pdf Generic Authentication Architecture by Timo Olkkonen, Helsinki University of Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two ways to use GAA (Generic Authentication Architecture). 
* The first, GBA, is based on a shared secret between the client and server
* The second, SSC, is based on public-private key pairs and digital certificates.

In the shared secret cases, the customer and the operator are first mutually authenticated through 3G and Authentication Key (AKA) and they agree on session keys which can then be used between the client and services that the customer wants to use. 
This is called ''bootstrapping''.
After that, the services can retrieve the session keys from the operator, and they can be used in some application specific protocol between the client and services.

Figure above shows the network GAA entities and interfaces between them. Optional entities are drawn with lines
network and borders dotted the scoreboard. The User Equipment (UE) is, for example, the user's mobile phone. The UE and
'''Bootstrapping Server Function''' ('''BSF''') mutually authenticate themselves during the Ub (number [2] above) interface, using the [[Digest access authentication]] [[AKA (security)|AKA]] protocol. The UE also communicates with the '''Network Application Functions''' ('''NAF'''), which are the implementation servers, over the Ua [4] interface, which can use any specific application protocol necessary.

BSF retrieves data from the subscriber from the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) during the Zh [3] interface, which uses the
[[Diameter (protocol)|Diameter]] Base Protocol. If there are several HSS in the network, BSF must first know which one to use. This can be done by either setting up a pre-defined HSS to BSF, or by querying the Subscriber Locator Function (SLF).
NAFs recover the key session of BSF during the Zn [5] interface, which also uses the diameter at the base Protocol. If
NAF is not in the home network, it must use a Zn-proxy to contact BSF .

== Uses ==
* The SPICE project developed an extended Use Case named "split terminal" where a user on a PC can authenticate with their mobile phone: http://www.ist-spice.org/demos/demo3.htm. The NAF was developed on SimpleSAMLPhP and a Firefox extension was developed to process the GBA digest authencation request from the BSF. Bluetooth SIM Access Profile was used between the Firefox browser and the mobile phone. Later a partner developed a "zero installation" concept.
* The research institute [[Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems|Fraunhofer FOKUS]] developed an OpenID extension for Firefox which uses GBA authentication.[https://web.archive.org/web/20150217142539/http://www.icin.biz/files/2008papers/Session5A-2.pdf Presentation at ICIN 2008 by Peter Weik]
* The Open Mobile Terminal Platform http://www.omtp.org references GBA in its Advanced Trusted Environment: OMTP TR1&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omtp.org/Publications/Display.aspx?Id=24ad518b-6dba-4155-ad51-3143bd43a234 OMTP Advanced Trusted Environment: OMTP TR1]&lt;/ref&gt; recommendation, first released in May 2008.

Sadly, despite many advantages and potential uses of GBA, its implementation in handsets has been limited since GBA standardization in 2006. Most notably, GBA was implemented in Symbian-based handsets.

'''Geophysical MASINT''' is a branch of [[Measurement and Signature Intelligence]] (MASINT) that involves phenomena transmitted through the earth (ground, water, atmosphere) and manmade structures including emitted or reflected sounds, pressure waves, vibrations, and magnetic field or ionosphere disturbances.&lt;ref name=FM2-0&gt;{{Cite journal

According to the [[United States Department of Defense]], MASINT is technically derived intelligence (excluding traditional imagery [[IMINT]] and signals intelligence [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]]) that – when collected, processed, and analyzed by dedicated MASINT systems – results in intelligence that detects, tracks, identifies, or describes the signatures (distinctive characteristics) of fixed or dynamic target sources.  MASINT was recognized as a formal intelligence discipline in 1986.&lt;ref name=IOSS-2&gt;{{Cite web

It feeds on a target's unintended emissive by-products, the "trails" - the spectral, chemical or RF that an object leaves behind. These trails form distinct signatures, which can be exploited as reliable discriminators to characterize specific events or disclose hidden targets."&lt;ref name=Lum1998&gt;{{Cite journal

As with many branches of MASINT, specific techniques may overlap with the six major conceptual disciplines of MASINT defined by the Center for MASINT Studies and Research, which divides MASINT into Electro-optical, Nuclear, Geophysical, Radar, Materials, and Radiofrequency disciplines.&lt;ref name=CMSR&gt;{{Cite journal

== Military Requirements ==

Geophysical sensors have a long history in conventional military and commercial applications, from [[Sailing weather prediction|weather prediction for sailing]], to fish finding for commercial fisheries, to nuclear test ban verification. New challenges, however, keep emerging.

For first-world military forces opposing other conventional militaries, there is an assumption that if a target can be located, it can be destroyed. As a result, concealment and deception have taken on new criticality. "Stealth" low-observability aircraft have gotten much attention, and new surface ship designs feature observability reduction. Operating in the confusing littoral environment produces a great deal of concealing interference.

Of course, submariners feel they invented low observability, and others are simply learning from them. They know that going deep or at least ultraquiet, and hiding among natural features, makes them very hard to detect.

Two families of military applications, among many, represent new challenges against which geophysical MASINT can be tried. Also, see [[MASINT#Unattended ground sensors|Unattended Ground Sensors]].

===Deeply Buried Structures===

One of the easiest ways for nations to protect weapons of mass destruction, command posts, and other critical structures is to bury them deeply, perhaps enlarging natural caves or disused mines. Deep burial is not only a means of protection against physical attack, as even without the use of nuclear weapons, there are deeply penetrating precision guided bombs that can attack them. Deep burial, with appropriate concealment during construction, is a way to avoid the opponent's knowing the buried facility's position well enough to direct precision guided weapons against it.

Finding deeply buried structures, therefore, is a critical military requirement.&lt;ref name=Streland2003&gt;{{Cite web

  |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-10-18
  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual first step in finding a deep structure is IMINT, especially using hyperspectral IMINT sensors to help eliminate concealment.  "Hyperspectral images can help reveal information not obtainable through other forms of imagery intelligence such as the moisture content of soil. This data can also help distinguish camouflage netting from natural foliage." Still, a facility dug under a busy city would be extremely hard to find during construction. When the opponent knows that it is suspected that a deeply buried facility exists, there can be a variety of decoys and lures, such as buried heat sources to confuse infrared sensors, or simply digging holes and covering them, with nothing inside.

MASINT using acoustic, seismic, and magnetic sensors would appear to have promise, but these sensors must be fairly close to the target. Magnetic Anomaly Detection (MAD) is used in antisubmarine water, for final localization before attack. The existence of the submarine is usually established through passive listening and refined with directional passive sensors and active sonar.

Once these sensors (as well as HUMINT and other sources) have failed, there is promise for surveying large areas and deeply concealed facilities using [[#Gravitimetric MASINT|gravitimetric sensors]]. Gravity sensors are a new field, but military requirements are making it important while the technology to do it is becoming possible.

===Naval Operations in Shallow Water===

Especially in today's "green water" and "brown water" naval applications, navies are looking at MASINT solutions to meet new challenges of operating in [[Littoral (military)|littoral areas of operations]].&lt;ref name=NASCGER-91&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate =  2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This symposium found it useful to look at five technology areas, which are interesting to contrast to the generally accepted categories of MASINT: acoustics and geology and geodesy/sediments/transport, nonacoustical detection (biology/optics/chemistry), physical oceanography, coastal meteorology, and electromagnetic detection.

Although it is unlikely there will ever be another World War II-style opposed landing on a fortified beach, another aspect of the littoral is being able to react to opportunities for amphibious warfare. Detecting shallow-water and beach mines remains a challenge, since mine warfare is a deadly "poor man's weapon."

While initial landings from an offshore force would be from helicopters or tiltrotor aircraft, with air cushion vehicles bringing ashore larger equipment, traditional landing craft, portable causeways, or other equipment will eventually be needed to bring heavy equipment across a beach. Shallow depth and natural underwater obstacles can block beach access to these craft and equipment, as can shallow-water mines. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), airborne laser detection and ranging (LIDAR) and use of bioluminescence to detect wake trails around underwater obstacles all may help solve this challenge.

Moving onto and across the beach has its own challenges. Remotely operated vehicles may be able to map landing routes, and they, as well as LIDAR and multispectral imaging, may be able to detect shallow water.  Once on the beach, the soil has to support heavy equipment. Techniques here include estimating soil type from multispectral imaging, or from an airdropped penetrometer that actually measures the loadbearing capacity of the surface.

==Weather and Sea Intelligence MASINT==

The science and art of weather prediction used the ideas of measurement and signatures to predict phenomena, long before there were any electronic sensors. Masters of sailing ships might have no more sophisticated instrument than a wetted finger raised to the wind, and the flapping of sails.

Weather information, in the normal course of military operations, has a major effect on tactics. High winds and low pressures can change artillery trajectories. High and low temperatures cause both people and equipment to require special protection. Aspects of weather, however, also can be measured and compared with signatures, to confirm or reject the findings of other sensors.

The state of the art is to fuse meteorological, oceanographic, and acoustic data in a variety of display modes. Temperature, salinity and sound speed can be displayed horizontally, vertically, or in three-dimensional perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Predicting Weather based on Measurements and Signatures===

While early sailors had no sensors beyond their five senses, the modern meteorologist has a wide range of geophysical and electro-optical measuring devices, operating on platforms from the bottom of the sea to deep space. Prediction based on these measurements are based on signatures of past weather events, a deep understanding of theory, and computational models.

Weather predictions can give significant negative intelligence, when the signature of some combat system is such that it can operate only under certain weather conditions. Weather has long been an extremely critical part of modern military operations, as when the decision to land at Normandy on June 6, rather than June 5, 1944 depended on [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s trust in his staff weather advisor, Group Captain [[James Martin Stagg]]. It is rarely understood that something as fast as a ballistic missile reentry vehicle, or as "smart" as a [[precision guided munition]], can still be affected by winds in the target area.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Remote Miniature Weather Station (RMWS), from System Innovations, is an air-droppable version with a lightweight, expendable and modular system with two components: a meteorological (MET) sensor and a ceilometer (cloud ceiling height) with limited MET. The basic MET system is surface-based and measures wind speed and direction, horizontal visibility, surface atmospheric pressure, air temperature and relative humidity.  The ceilometer sensor determines cloud height and discrete cloud layers. The system provides near-real-time data capable of 24-hour operation for 60 days.  The RMWS can also go in with US Air Force Special Operations combat weathermen&lt;ref name=Gourley2003&gt;{{cite journal

The man-portable version, brought in by combat weathermen, has an additional function, as remote miniature ceilometer. Designed to measure multiple layer cloud ceiling heights and then send that data via satellite communications link to an operator display, the system uses a Neodinum YAG (NdYAG), 4 megawatt non-eye safe laser. According to one weatherman, "We have to watch that one,” he said. “Leaving it out there basically we’re worried about civilian populace going out there and playing with it—firing the laser and there goes somebody’s eye. There are two different units [to RMWS]. One has the laser and one doesn’t. The basic difference is the one with the laser is going to give you cloud height."

=== Hydrographic Sensors ===

Hydrographic MASINT is subtly different from weather, in that it considers factors such as water temperature and salinity, biologic activities, and other factors that have a major effect on sensors and weapons used in shallow water. ASW equipment, especially acoustic performance depends on the season the specific coastal site. Water column conditions, such as temperature, salinity, and turbidity are more variable in shallow than deep water. Water depth will influence bottom bounce conditions, as will the material of the bottom. Seasonal water column conditions (particularly summer versus winter) are inherently more variable in shallow water than in deep water.&lt;ref name=NASCGER-91 /&gt;

While much attention is given to shallow waters of the littoral, other areas have unique hydrographic characteristics.

:*regional areas with fresh water eddies
:*open ocean salinity fronts
:*near ice floes
:*under ice

A submarine tactical development activity observed, "Fresh water eddies exist in many areas of the world. As we have experienced recently in the Gulf of Mexico using the Tactical Oceanographic Monitoring System (TOMS), there exist very distinct surface ducts that causes the Submarine Fleet Mission Program Library (SFMPL) sonar prediction to be unreliable. Accurate bathythermic information is paramount and a precursor for accurate sonar predictions.”

==== Temperature and Salinity ====

Critical to the prediction of sound, needed by active and passive MASINT systems operating in water is knowing the temperature and salinity at specific depths. Antisubmarine aircraft, ships, and submarines can release independent sensors that measure the water temperature at various depths.&lt;ref name=UltraElectronics /&gt; The water temperature is critically important in acoustic detections, as changes in water temperature at [[thermocline]]s can act as a "barrier" or "layer" to acoustic propagation. To hunt a submarine, which is aware of water temperature, the hunter must drop acoustic sensors below the thermocline.

Water conductivity is used as a surrogate marker for salinity. The current and most recently developed software, however, does not give information on suspended material in the water or bottom characteristics, both considered critical in shallow-water operations.&lt;ref name="NASCGER-91  "/&gt;

The US Navy does this by dropping expendable probes, which transmit to a recorder, of 1978-1980 vintage, the AN/BQH-7 for submarines and the AN/BQH-71 for surface ships. While the redesign of the late seventies did introduce digital logic, the devices kept hard-to-maintain analog recorders, and maintainability became critical by 1995. A project was begun to extend  with COTS components, to result in the AN/BQH-7/7A EC-3.&lt;ref name=Moss1997&gt;{{Cite journal

Variables in selecting the appropriate probe include:
:*Maximum depth sounded
:*Speed of launching vessel
:*Resolution Vertical Distance Between Data Points (ft)
:*Depth Accuracy

====Biomass====

Large schools of fish contain enough entrapped air to conceal the sea floor, or manmade underwater vehicles and structures. [[Fishfinder]]s, developed for commercial and recreational fishing, are specialized sonars that can identify acoustic reflections between the surface and the bottom. Variations on commercial equipment are apt to be needed, especially in littoral areas rich in marine life.

====Sea Bottom Measurement====
A variety of sensors  can be used to characterise the sea bottom into, for example, mud, sand, and gravel. Active acoustic sensors are the most obvious, but there is potential information from gravitimetric sensors, electro-optical and radar sensors for making inferences from the water surface, etc.

Relatively simple sonars such as echo sounders can be promoted to seafloor classification systems via add-on modules, converting echo parameters into sediment type. Different algorithms exist, but they are all based on changes in the energy or shape of the reflected sounder pings.

[[Side-scan sonar]]s can be used to derive maps of the topography of an area by moving the sonar across it just above the bottom. Multibeam hull-mounted sonars are not as precise as a sensor near the bottom, but both can give reasonable three-dimensional visualization.

Another approach comes from greater signal processing of existing military sensors.&lt;ref name=Avera&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is adding onboard weather instrumentations, including data such as wind direction and speed;, air and ground temperature; barometric pressure and humidity.

==Acoustic MASINT==

This includes the  collection of passive or active emitted or reflected sounds, pressure waves or vibrations in the atmosphere (ACOUSTINT) or in the water (ACINT) or conducted through the ground Going well back into the Middle Ages, military engineers would listen to the ground for sounds of telltale digging under fortifications.&lt;ref name=FM2-0 /&gt;

In modern times, acoustic sensors were first used in the air, as with artillery ranging in World War I.  Passive hydrophones were used by the World War I Allies against German submarines; the  UC-3, was sunk with the aid of hydrophone on 23 April 1916.  Since submerged submarines cannot use radar, passive and active acoustic systems are their primary sensors. Especially for the passive sensors, the submarine acoustic sensor operators must have extensive libraries of acoustic signatures, to identify sources of sound.

In shallow water, there are sufficient challenges to conventional acoustic sensors that additional MASINT sensors may be required. Two major confounding factors are:
:*Boundary interactions. The effects of the seafloor and the sea surface on acoustic systems in shallow water are highly complex, making range predictions difficult. Multi-path degradation affects overall figure of merit and active classification. As a result, false target identifications are frequent.
:*Practical limitations. Another key issue is the range dependence of shallow water propagation and reverberation. For example, shallow water limits the depth of towed sound detection arrays, thus increasing the possibility of the system's detecting its own noise. In addition, closer ship spacing increases the potential for mutual interference effects. It is believed that nonacoustic sensors, of magnetic, optical, bioluminescent, chemical, and hydrodynamic disturbances will be necessary in shallow-water naval operations.&lt;ref name=NASCGER-91 /&gt;

===Counterbattery and Countersniper Location and Ranging===

While now primarily of historical interest, one of the first applications of acoustic and optical MASINT was locating enemy artillery by the sound of their firing and flashes respectively during World War I.  Effective [[sound ranging]] was pioneered by the British Army under the leadership of the Nobel Lauriate William Bragg.  Flash spotting developed in parallel in the British, French and German armies.  The combination of sound ranging (i.e., acoustic MASINT) and flash ranging (i.e., before modern optoelectronics) gave information unprecedented for the time, in both accuracy and timeliness.   Enemy gun positions were located within 25 to 100 yards, with the information coming in three minutes or less.

====Initial WWI Counterbattery Acoustic Systems====

[[File:MASINT-WWI-SoundRanging.png|thumb|right|Sound Ranging]]

In the "Sound Ranging" graphic, the manned Listening (or Advanced) Post, is sited a few 'sound seconds (or about 2000 yards) forward of the line of the unattended microphones, it sends an electrical signal to the recording station to switch on the recording apparatus. The positions of the microphones are precisely known. The differences in sound time of arrival, taken from the recordings, were then used to plot the source of the sound by one of several techniques. See http://nigelef.tripod.com/p_artyint-cb.htm#SoundRanging

Where sound ranging is a time-of-arrival technique not dissimilar to that of modern multistatic sensors, flash spotting used optical instruments to take bearings on the flash from accurately surveyed observation posts. The location of the gun was determined by plotting the bearings reported to the same gun flashes. See http://nigelef.tripod.com/p_artyint-cb.htm#FieldSurveyCoy  Flash ranging, today, would be called electro-optical MASINT.

Artillery sound and flash ranging remained in use through World War II and in its latest forms until the present day, although flash spotting generally ceased in the 1950s due to the widespread adoption of flashless propellants and the increasing range of artillery.  Mobile counterbattery radars able to detect guns, itself a MASINT radar sensor, became available in the late 1970s, although countermortar radars appeared in World War II. These techniques paralleled radio direction finding in SIGINT that started in World War I, using graphical bearing plotting and now, with the precision time synchronization from GPS, is often time-of-arrival.

====Modern Acoustic Artillery Locators====

Artillery positions now are located primarily with Unmanned Air Systems and IMINT or [[Radar MASINT#Counterartillery Radar|counterartillery radar]], such as the widely used Swedish ArtHuR. SIGINT also may give clues to positions, both with COMINT for firing orders, and ELINT for such things as weather radar. Still, there is renewed interest in both acoustic and [[Electro-optical MASINT#Tactical counter-artillery sensors|electro-optical]] systems to complement counterartillery radar.

Acoustic sensors have come a long way since World War I. Typically, the acoustic sensor is part of a combined system, in which it [[MASINT#Cueing|cues]] radar or electro-optical sensors of greater precision, but narrower field of view.

=====HALO=====

The UK's hostile artillery locating system (HALO) has been in service with the British Army since the 1990s. HALO is not as precise as radar, but especially complements the directional radars. It passively detects artillery cannon, mortars and tank guns, with 360 degree coverage and can monitor over 2,000 square kilometers. HALO has worked in urban areas, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Iraq.&lt;ref name=Caldwell&gt;{{Cite web

The system consists of three or more unmanned sensor positions, each with four microphones and local processing, these deduce the bearing to a gun, mortar, etc.  These bearings are automatically communicated to a central processor that combines them to triangulate the source of the sound. It can compute location data on up to 8 rounds per second, and display the data to the system operator. HALO may be used in conjunction with COBRA and ArtHur counter battery radars, which are not omnidirectional, to focus on the correct sector.

=====UTAMS=====

Another acoustic system is the Unattended Transient Acoustic MASINT Sensor (UTAMS), developed by the [[U.S. Army Research Laboratory]], which detects mortar and rocket launches and impacts. UTAMS remains the primary cueing sensor for the Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS). ARL mounted aerostats with UTAMS, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The History of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory |url=https://books.google.com/?id=G8wIcWpgq4wC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Unattended+Transient+Acoustic+MASINT+Sensor+(UTAMS)#v=onepage&amp;q=Unattended%20Transient%20Acoustic%20MASINT%20Sensor%20(UTAMS)&amp;f=false |website=Google Books |publisher=U.S. Army Research Laboratory |accessdate=20 June 2018|isbn=9780160942310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; developing the system in a little over two months.  After receiving a direct request from Iraq, ARL merged components from several programs to enable the rapid fielding of this capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Tenney |first1=Stephen |title=Acoustic Mortar Localization System – Results from OIF |publisher=U.S. Army Research Laboratory |citeseerx=10.1.1.914.4994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    

UTAMS has three to five acoustic arrays, each with four microphones, a processor, radio link, power source, and a laptop control computer.  UTAMS, which was first operational in Iraq,&lt;ref name=UTAMS&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; first tested in November 2004 at a Special Forces Operating Base (SFOB) in Iraq. UTAMS was used in conjunction with AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 [[Radar MASINT#Ground Tactical Radar MASINT|counter-artillery radar]]. While UTAMS was intended principally for detecting indirect artillery fire, Special Forces and their fire support officer learned it could pinpoint improvised explosive device (IED) explosions and small arms/rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) fires. It detected Points of Origin (POO) up to 10 kilometers from the sensor.

Analyzing the UTAMS and radar logs revealed several patterns. The opposing force was firing 60&amp;nbsp;mm mortars during observed dining hours, presumably since that gave the largest groupings of personnel and the best chance of producing heavy casualties. That would have been obvious from the impact history alone, but these MASINT sensors established a pattern of the enemy firing locations.

This allowed the US forces to move mortars into range of the firing positions, give coordinates to cannon when the mortars were otherwise committed, and to use attack helicopters as a backup to both. The opponents changed to night fires, which, again, were countered with mortar, artillery, and helicopter fires. They then moved into an urban area where US artillery was not allowed to fire, but a combination of [[PSYOPS]] leaflet drops and deliberate near misses convinced the locals not to give sanctuary to the mortar crews.

[[File:MASINT-UTAMStower.png| thumb |Tower-mounted UTAMS array component of [[Electro-optical MASINT#Rocket launch spotter|UTAMS in the Rocket Launch Spotter (RLS) system]]]]

Originally for a Marine requirement in Afghanistan, UTAMS was combined with electro-optical MASINT to produce the [[Electro-optical MASINT#Rocket launch spotter|Rocket Launch Spotter (RLS)]] system useful against both rockets and mortars.

In the Rocket Launch Spotter (RLS) application,&lt;ref name=Mabe&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; each array consists of four microphones and processing equipment. Analyzing the time delays between an acoustic wavefront’s interaction with each microphone in the array UTAMS provides an azimuth of origin. The azimuth from each tower is reported to the UTAMS processor at the control station, and a POO is triangulated and displayed. The UTAMS subsystem can also detect and locate the point of impact (POI), but, due to the difference between the speeds of sound and light, it may take UTAMS as long as 30 seconds to determine the POO for a rocket launch 13&amp;nbsp;km away. In this application,  the electro-optical component of RLS will detect the rocket POO earlier, while UTAMS may do better with the mortar prediction.

===Passive sea-based acoustic sensors (hydrophones)===
Modern hydrophones convert sound to electrical energy, which then can undergo additional signal processing, or that can be transmitted immediately to a receiving station. They may be directional or omnidirectional.

Navies use a variety of acoustic systems, especially passive, in antisubmarine warfare, both tactical and strategic. For tactical use, passive hydrophones, both on ships and airdropped [[sonobuoys]], are used extensively in antisubmarine warfare. They can detect targets far further away than with active sonar, but generally will not have the precision location of active sonar, approximating it with a technique called Target Motion Analysis (TMA). Passive sonar has the advantage of not revealing the position of the sensor.

The Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS) consists of multiple subsystems in SOSUS, Fixed Distributed System (FDS), and the Advanced Deployable System (ADS or [[SURTASS]]). Reducing the emphasis on Cold War blue-water operations put SOSUS, with more flexible "tuna boat" sensing vessels called [[SURTASS]] being the primary blue-water long-range sensors&lt;ref name=SURTASS-1&gt;{{cite web

SURTASS used longer, more sensitive towed passive acoustic arrays than could be deployed from maneuvering vessels, such as submarines and destroyers. [[File:USNS Able (T-AGOS-20) aft SURTASS equipment.jpg|thumb|300px|USNS Able (T-AGOS-20) aft view of [[SURTASS]] equipment.]]

SURTASS is now being complemented by Low Frequency Active (LFA) sonar; see the sonar section.

====Air-dropped passive acoustic sensors====
Passive sonobuoys, such as the AN/SSQ-53F, can be directional or omnidirectional and can be set to sink to a specific depth.&lt;ref name=UltraElectronics /&gt; These would be dropped from helicopters and maritime patrol aircraft such as the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3]].

==== Surface ship passive acoustic sensors ====

Purely from the standpoint of detection, towed hydrophone arrays offer a long baseline and exceptional measurement capability. Towed arrays, however, are not always feasible, because when deployed, their performance can suffer, or they can suffer outright damage, from fast speeds or radical turns. A state-of-the-art British towed array, with both passive and active capabilities,  is [[Sonar 2087]] made by [[Thales Underwater Systems]].

Steerable sonar arrays on the hull or bow usually have a passive as well as active mode, as do variable-depth sonars

Surface ships may have warning receivers to detect hostile sonar.

==== Submarine passive acoustic sensors ====
Modern submarines have multiple passive hydrophone systems, such as a steerable array in a bow dome, fixed sensors along the sides of the submarines, and towed arrays. They also have specialized acoustic receivers, analogous to radar warning receivers, to alert the crew to the use of active sonar against their submarine.

US submarines made extensive clandestine patrols to measure the signatures of Soviet submarines and surface vessels.&lt;ref name=Sontag1999&gt;{{cite book

===Land-based Passive Acoustic Sensors (geophones)===

Vietnam-era acoustic MASINT sensors included "Acoubuoy (36 inches long, 26 pounds) floated down by camouflaged parachute and caught in the trees, where it hung to listen. The Spikebuoy (66 inches long, 40 pounds) planted itself in the ground like a lawn dart. Only the antenna, which looked like the stalks of weeds, was left showing above ground."&lt;ref name=IglooWhite&gt;{{Cite journal|author=John T.

This was part of [[Operation Igloo White]].

Part of the AN/GSQ-187 Improved Remote Battlefield Sensor System (I-REMBASS) is a passive acoustic sensor, which, with other MASINT sensors, detects vehicles and personnel on a battlefield.&lt;ref name=I-REMBASS&gt;{{Cite web

I-REMBASS control will integrate, in approximately 2008, with the [[SIGINT Operational Platforms by Nation#United States: Tactical Ground ystems|Prophet SIGINT/EW ground system]].

For example, a ground search radar may not be able to differentiate between a tank and a truck moving at the same speed. Adding acoustic information, however, may quickly distinguish between them.

===Active Acoustic Sensors and Supporting Measurements===
Combatant vessels, of course, made extensive use of active [[sonar]], which is yet another acoustic MASINT sensor. Besides the obvious application in antisubmarine warfare, specialized active acoustic systems have roles in:
:*Mapping the seafloor for navigation and collision avoidance.  These include basic depth gauges, but quickly get into devices that do 3-dimensional underwater mapping
:*Determining seafloor characteristics, for applications varying from understanding its sound-reflecting properties, to predicting the type of marine life that may be found there, to knowing when a surface is appropriate for anchoring or for using various equipment that will contact the seafloor

Various synthetic aperture sonars have been built in the laboratory and some have entered use in mine-hunting and search systems.  An explanation of their operation is given in [[synthetic aperture sonar]].

====Water Surface, Fish Interference and Bottom Characterization====
The water surface and bottom are reflecting and scattering boundaries. Large schools of fish, with air in their swim bladder balance apparatus, can also have a significant effect on acoustic propagation.

For many purposes, but not all naval tactical applications, the sea-air surface can be thought of as a perfect reflector. "The effects of the seafloor and the sea surface on acoustic systems in shallow water are highly complex, making range predictions difficult. Multi-path degradation affects overall figure of merit and active classification. As a result, false target identifications are frequent."&lt;ref name=NASCGER-91 /&gt;

The acoustic impedance mismatch between water and the bottom is generally much less than at the surface and is more complex. It depends on the bottom material types and depth of the layers. Theories have been developed for predicting the sound propagation in the bottom in this case, for example by Biot&lt;ref&gt;N Chotiros, Biot Model of Sound Propagation in Water Saturated Sand. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. '''97''', 199 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and by Buckingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=====Water Surface=====
For high frequency sonars (above about 1&amp;nbsp;kHz) or when the sea is rough, some of the incident sound is scattered, and this is taken into account by assigning a reflection coefficient whose magnitude is less than one.

Rather than measuring surface effects directly from a ship, radar MASINT, in aircraft or satellites, may give better measurements. These measurements would then be transmitted to the vessel's acoustic signal processor.

=====Under Ice=====

A surface covered with ice, of course, is tremendously difference than even storm-driven water.  Purely from a collision avoidance and acoustic propagation, a submarine needs to know how close it is to the bottom of ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Three-dimensional ice information also can tell the submarine captain whether antisubmarine warfare aircraft can detect or attack the boat.

The state of the art is providing the submarine with a three-dimensional visualization of the ice above: the lowest part (ice keel) and the ice canopy. While sound will propagate differently in ice than liquid water, the ice still needs to be considered as a volume, to understand the nature of reverberations within it.

=====Bottom=====

A typical basic depth measuring device is the US AN/UQN-4A. Both the water surface and bottom are reflecting and scattering boundaries. For many purposes, but not all naval tactical applications, the sea-air surface can be thought of as a perfect reflector. In reality, there are complex interactions of water surface activity, seafloor characteristics, water temperature and salinity, and other factors that  make "...range predictions difficult. Multi-path degradation affects overall figure of merit and active classification. As a result, false target identifications are frequent."&lt;ref name=NASCGER-91 /&gt;

This device, however, does not give information on the characteristics of the bottom. In many respects, commercial fishing and marine scientists have equipment that is perceived as needed for shallow water operation.

[[File:Side-scan sonar.svg|thumb|251px|right|Diagram of sidescan sonar with towed probe, higher performance than multibeam ship-mounted but comparable]]

=====Biologic Effects on Sonar Reflection=====

A further complication is the presence of wind generated bubbles or fish close to the sea surface.

This problem is distinct from biologic interference caused by acoustic energy generated by marine life, such as the squeaks of porpoises and other [[cetacean]]s, and measured by acoustic receivers. The signatures of biologic sound generators need to be differentiated from more deadly denizens of the depths. Classifying biologics is a very good example of an acoustic MASINT process.

====Surface Combatants====

Modern surface combatants with an ASW mission will have a variety of active systems, with a hull- or bow-mounted array, protected from water by a rubber dome; a "variable-depth" dipping sonar on a cable, and, especially on smaller vessels, a fixed acoustic generator and receiver.

Some, but not all, vessels carry passive towed arrays, or combined active-passive arrays.   These depend on target noise, which, in the combined littoral environment of ultraquiet submarines in the presence of much ambient noise. Vessels that have deployed towed arrays cannot make radical course maneuvers.  Especially when active capabilities are included, the array can be treated as a bistatic or multistatic sensor, and act as a synthetic aperture sonar (SAS)

For ships that cooperate with aircraft, they will need a data link to sonobuoys and a sonobuoy signal processor, unless the aircraft has extensive processing capability and can send information that can be accepted directly by tactical computers and displays.

Signal processors not only analyze the signals, but constantly track propagation conditions. The former is usually considered part of a particular sonar, but the US Navy has a separate propagation predictor called the AN/UYQ-25B(V) Sonar ''in situ'' Mode Assessment System (SIMAS)
       
Echo Tracker Classifiers (ETC) are adjuncts, with a clear MASINT flavor, to existing surface ship sonars
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dynamics Technology, Inc. |title=Synthetic Aperture Sonar for Enhanced Classification |id=ETC |url=http://www.dawnbreaker.com/vas05/docs/Dyn1-Brief.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-10-18 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ETC is an application of synthetic aperture sonar (SAS). SAS is already used for minehunting, but could help existing surface combatants, as well as future vessels and unmanned surface vehicles (USV), detect threats, such as very silent air-independent propulsion non-nuclear submarines, outside torpedo range. Torpedo range, especially in shallow water, is considered anything greater than 10 nmi.

Conventional active sonar may be more effective than towed arrays, but the small size of modern littoral submarines makes them difficult threats. Highly variable bottom paths, biologics, and other factors complicate sonar detection. If the target is slow-moving or waiting on the bottom, they have little or no [[Doppler effect]], which current sonars use to recognize threats.

Continual active tracking measurement of all acoustically detected objects, with recognition of signatures as deviations from ambient noise, still gives a high false alarm rate (FAR) with conventional sonar. SAS processing, however, improves the resolution, especially of azimuth measurements, by assembling the data from multiple pings into a synthetic beam that gives the effect of a far larger receiver.

MASINT-oriented SAS measures shape characteristics and eliminates acoustically detected objects that do not conform to the signature of threats. Shape recognition is only one of the parts of the signature, which include course and Doppler when available.

====Air-Dropped Active Sonobuoys====
Active  sonobuoys, containing a sonar transmitter and receiver, can be dropped from fixed-wing maritime patrol aircraft (e.g., [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3]], [[Nimrod]], Chinese Y-8, Russian and Indian Bear ASW variants), antisubmarine helicopters, and carrier-based antisubmarine aircraft (e.g., [[S-3 Viking|S-3]]). While there have been some efforts to use other aircraft simply as carriers of sonobuoys, the general assumption is that the sonobuoy-carrying aircraft can issue commands to the sonobuoys and receive, and to some extent process, their signals.

The Directional Hydrophone Command Activated Sonobuoy system (DICASS) both generate sound and listen for it. A typical modern active sonobuoy, such as the AN/SSQ 963D, generates multiple acoustic frequencies

====Airborne Dipping Sonar====

Antisubmarine helicopters can carry a "dipping" sonar head at the end of a cable, which the helicopter can raise from or lower into the water. The helicopter would typically dip the sonar when trying to localize a target submarine, usually in cooperation with other ASW platforms or with sonobuoys. Typically, the helicopter would raise the head after dropping an ASW weapon, to avoid damaging the sensitive receiver. Not all variants of the same basic helicopter, even assigned to ASW, carry dipping sonar; some may trade the weight of the sonar for more sonobuoy or weapon capacity.

[[File:AQS-13 Dipping sonar.jpg|thumb|left|300px|AN/AQS-13 Dipping sonar deployed from an [[H-3 Sea King]], an aircraft used by numerous countries and produced in Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom]]

The EH101 helicopter, used by a number of nations, has a variety of dipping sonars. The (British) Royal Navy version has Ferranti/Thomson-CSF (now Thales) sonar, while the Italian version uses the HELRAS. Russian [[Ka-25]] helicopters carry dipping sonar, as does the US  [[Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System|LAMPS]], US MH-60R helicopter, which carries the Thales AQS-22 dipping sonar. The older [[SH-60]]F helicopter carries the [[AQS-13]]F dipping sonar.

====Surveillance Vessel Low-Frequency Active====

A decision has been made to employ LFA on SURTASS vessels, after an environmental impact statement that indicated, if LFA is used with decreased power levels in certain high-risk areas for marine life, it would be safe when employed from a moving ship. The ship motion, and the variability of the LFA signal, would limit the exposure to individual sea animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; LFA operates in the low-frequency (LF) acoustic band of 100–500&amp;nbsp;Hz. It has an active component, the LFA proper, and the passive SURTASS hydrophone array. "The active component of the system, LFA, is a set of 18 LF acoustic transmitting source elements (called projectors) suspended by cable from underneath an oceanographic surveillance vessel, such as the Research Vessel (R/V) Cory Chouest, USNS Impeccable (T-AGOS 23), and the Victorious class (TAGOS 19 class).

"The source level of an individual projector is 215 dB. These projectors produce the active sonar signal or “ping.” A "ping," or transmission, can last between 6 and 100 seconds. The time between transmissions is typically 6 to 15 minutes with an average transmission of 60 seconds. Average duty cycle (ratio of sound “on” time to total time) is less than 20 percent. The typical duty cycle, based on historical LFA operational parameters (2003 to 2007), is normally 7.5 to 10 percent."

This signal "...is not a continuous tone, but rather a transmission of waveforms that vary in frequency and duration. The duration of each continuous frequency sound transmission is normally 10 seconds or less. The signals are loud at the source, but levels diminish rapidly over the first kilometer."

====Submarine Active Acoustic Sensors====

The primary tactical active sonar of a submarine is usually in the bow, covered with a protective dome. Submarines for blue-water operations used active systems such as the AN/SQS-26 and AN/SQS-53 have been developed but were generally designed for convergence zone and single bottom bounce environments.

Submarines that operate in the Arctic also have specialized sonar for under-ice operation; think of an upside-down fathometer.

Submarines also may have minehunting sonar. Using measurements to differentiate between biologic signatures and signatures of objects that will permanently sink the submarine is as critical a MASINT application as could be imagined.

====Active Acoustic Sensors for Minehunting====

Sonars optimized to detect objects of the size and shapes of mines can be carried by submarines, remotely operated vehicles, surface vessels (often on a boom or cable) and specialized helicopters.

The classic emphasis on minesweeping, and detonating the mine released from its tether using gunfire, has been replaced with the AN/SLQ-48(V)2 mine neutralization system (MNS)AN/SLQ-48 - (remotely operated) Mine Neutralization Vehicle. This works well for rendering save mines in deep water, by placing explosive charges on the mine and/or its tether.  The AN/SLQ-48 is not well suited to the neutralization of shallow-water mines. The vehicle tends to be underpowered and may leave on the bottom a mine that looks like a mine to any subsequent sonar search and an explosive charge subject to later detonation under proper impact conditions.

There is mine-hunting sonar, as well as (electro-optical) television on the ROV, and AN/[[SQQ-32]] minehunting sonar on the ship.

=== Acoustic sensing of large explosions ===

An assortment of time-synchronized sensors can characterize conventional or nuclear explosions.  One pilot study, the Active Radio Interferometer for Explosion Surveillance (ARIES). This technique implements an operational system for monitoring ionospheric pressure waves resulting from surface or atmospheric nuclear or chemical explosives. Explosions produce pressure waves that can be detected by measuring phase variations between signals generated by ground stations along two different paths to a satellite.&lt;ref name=Ives /&gt; This is a very modernized version, on a larger scale, of World War I sound ranging.

As can many sensors, ARIES can be used for additional purposes. Collaborations are being pursued with the Space Forecast Center to use ARIES data for total electron content measures on a global scale, and with the meteorology/global environment community to monitor global climate change (via tropospheric water vapor content measurements), and by the general ionospheric physics community to study travelling ionospheric disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Sensors relatively close to a nuclear event, or a high-explosive test simulating a nuclear event, can detect, using acoustic methods, the pressure produced by the blast.  These include [[infrasound]]  [[microbarograph]]s (acoustic pressure sensors) that detect very low-frequency sound waves in the atmosphere produced by natural and man-made events.

Closely related to the microbarographs, but detecting pressure waves in water, are hydro-acoustic sensors, both underwater microphones and specialized seismic sensors that detect the motion of islands.

==Seismic MASINT==

US Army Field Manual 2-0 defines seismic intelligence as "The passive collection and measurement of seismic waves or vibrations in the earth surface."&lt;ref name=FM2-0 /&gt; One strategic application of seismic intelligence makes use of the science of [[seismology]] to locate and characterize nuclear testing, especially underground testing. Seismic sensors also can characterize large conventional explosions that are used in testing the high-explosive components of nuclear weapons. Seismic intelligence also can help locate such things as large underground construction projects.

Since many areas of the world have a great deal of natural seismic activity, seismic MASINT is one of the emphatic arguments that there must be a long-term commitment to measuring, even during peacetime, so that the signatures of natural behavior is known before it is necessary to search for variations from signatures.

=== Strategic Seismic MASINT ===

For nuclear test detection, seismic intelligence is limited by the "threshold principle" coined in 1960 by [[George Kistiakowsky]], which recognized that while detection technology would continue to improve, there would be a threshold below which small explosions could not be detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |mode=cs1

===Tactical Seismic MASINT===

The most common sensor in the Vietnam-era "McNamara Line" of remote sensors was the ADSID (Air-Delivered Seismic Intrusion Detector) sensed earth motion to detect people and vehicles. It resembled the Spikebuoy, except it was smaller and lighter (31&amp;nbsp;inches long, 25 pounds).
The challenge for the seismic sensors (and for the analysts) was not so much in detecting the people and the trucks as it was in separating out the false alarms generated by wind, thunder, rain, earth tremors, and animals—especially frogs."&lt;ref name=IglooWhite /&gt;

==Vibration MASINT==
This subdiscipline is also called '''[[piezoelectric]] MASINT''' after the sensor most often used to sense vibration, but vibration detectors need not be piezoelectric. Note that some discussions treat seismic and vibration sensors as a subset of acoustic MASINT. Other possible detectors could be [[Magnetic cartridge#Moving Coil (MC) cartridges|moving coil]] or [[surface acoustic wave]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vibration, as a form of geophysical energy to be sensed, has similarities to [[#Acoustic MASINT|acoustic]] and [[#Seismic MASINT|seismic MASINT]], but also has distinct differences that make it useful, especially in [[MASINT#Unattended ground sensors|unattended ground sensors (UGS)]]. In the UGS application, one advantage of a [[piezoelectric sensor]] is that it generates electricity when triggered, rather than consuming electricity, an important consideration for remote sensors whose lifetime may be determined by their battery capacity.

While acoustic signals at sea travel through water, on land, they can be assumed to come through the air. Vibration, however, is conducted through a solid medium on land. It has a higher frequency than is typical of seismic conducted signals.

A typical detector, the Thales MA2772 vibration is a piezoelectric cable, shallowly buried below the ground surface, and extended for 750 meters. Two variants are available, a high-sensitivity version for personnel detection, and lower-sensitivity version to detect vehicles. Using two or more sensors will determine the direction of travel, from the sequence in which the sensors trigger.

In addition to being buried, piezoelectric vibration detectors, in a cable form factor, also are used as part of high-security fencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be embedded in walls or other structures that need protection.

==Magnetic MASINT==

A magnetometer is a scientific instrument used to measure the strength and/or direction of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the instrument. The measurements they make can be compared to signatures of vehicles on land, submarines underwater, and atmospheric radio propagation conditions. They come in two basic types: 
*'''scalar magnetometers''' measure the total strength of the magnetic field to which they are subjected, and
*'''vector magnetometers''' have the capability to measure the component of the magnetic field in a particular direction.

Earth's magnetism varies from place to place and differences in the Earth's magnetic field (the magnetosphere) can be caused by two things:

:*the differing nature of rocks
:*the interaction between charged particles from the sun and the magnetosphere

Metal detectors use electromagnetic induction to detect metal. They can also determine the changes in existing magnetic fields caused by metallic objects.

===Indicating Loops for detecting Submarines===
One of the first means for detecting submerged submarines, first installed by the Royal Navy in 1914,  was the effect of their passage over an anti-submarine indicator loop on the bottom of a body of water. A metal object passing over it, such as a submarine, will, even if degaussed, have enough magnetic properties to induce a current in the loop's cable. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://home.iprimus.com.au/waldingr/loopworks.htm
  | id = Walding
  | accessdate =  2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the motion of the metal submarine across the indicating coil acts as an oscillator, producing electric current.

===MAD===
A '''magnetic anomaly detector''' (MAD) is an instrument used to detect minute variations in the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. The term refers specifically to [[magnetometer]]s used either by military forces to detect [[submarine]]s (a mass of [[ferromagnetic]] material creates a detectable disturbance in the [[magnetic field]])Magnetic anomaly detectors were first employed to detect submarines during World War II.  MAD gear was used by both Japanese and U.S. anti-submarine forces, either towed by ship or mounted in aircraft to detect shallow submerged enemy submarines.  After the war, the U.S. Navy continued to develop MAD gear as a parallel development with sonar detection technologies.

To reduce interference from electrical equipment or metal in the [[fuselage]] of the aircraft, the MAD sensor is placed at the end of a boom or a towed aerodynamic device. Even so, the submarine must be very near the aircraft's position and close to the sea surface for detection of the change or anomaly. The detection range is normally related to the distance between the sensor and the [[submarine]]. The size of the submarine and its hull composition determine the detection range. MAD devices are usually mounted on [[aircraft]] [[File:Lockheed P-3C (JMSDF)02.jpg|thumb|MAD rear boom on P-3C]]
[[File:SH-60B Seahawk.jpg|thumb|left|The [[SH-60B Seahawk]] helicopter carries an orange, towed MAD array known as a ‘MAD bird’, seen on the aft fuselage.]] or [[helicopter]]s.

There is some misunderstanding of the mechanism of detection of submarines in water using the MAD boom system. [[Magnetic moment]] displacement is ostensibly the main disturbance, yet submarines are detectable even when oriented parallel to the Earth's magnetic field, despite construction with non-ferromagnetic hulls.

For example, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-[[Russia]]n [[Alfa class submarine]], was constructed out of [[titanium]]. This light, strong material, as well as a unique nuclear power system, allowed the submarine to break speed and depth records for operational boats. It was thought that nonferrous titanium would defeat magnetic ASW sensors, but this was not the case. to give dramatic submerged performance and protection from detection by MAD sensors, is still detectable.

Since titanium structures are detectable, MAD sensors do not directly detect deviations in the Earth's magnetic field. Instead, they may be described as long-range electric and electromagnetic field detector arrays of great sensitivity.

An [[electric field]] is set up in conductors experiencing a variation in physical environmental conditions, providing that they are contiguous and possess sufficient mass. Particularly in submarine hulls, there is a measurable temperature difference between the bottom and top of the hull producing a related [[salinity]] difference, as salinity is affected by temperature of water. The difference in salinity creates an [[electric potential]] across the hull. An electric current then flows through the hull, between the laminae of sea-water separated by depth and temperature. The resulting dynamic electric field produces an electromagnetic field of its own, and thus even a titanium hull will be detectable on a MAD scope, as will a surface ship for the same reason.

===Vehicle Detectors===

The Remotely Emplaced Battlefield Surveillance System (REMBASS) is a US Army program for detecting the presence, speed, and direction of a ferrous object, such as a tank. Coupled with acoustic sensors that recognize the sound signature of a tank, it could offer high accuracy. It also collects weather information.&lt;ref name="CACI I-REMBASS"&gt;{{cite web

The Army's AN/GSQ-187 Improved Remote Battlefield Sensor System (I-REMBASS) includes both magnetic-only and combined passive infrared/magnetic intrusion detectors. The DT-561/GSQ hand emplaced MAG "sensor detects vehicles (tracked or wheeled) and personnel carrying ferrous metal. It also provides information on which to base a count of objects passing through its detection zone and reports their direction of travel relative to its location. The monitor uses two different (MAG and IR) sensors and their identification codes to determine direction of travel.&lt;ref name="CACI I-REMBASS"/&gt;

===Magnetic detonators and countermeasures===

Magnetic sensors, much more sophisticated than the early inductive loops, can trigger the explosion of mines or torpedoes. Early in World War II, the US tried to put magnetic torpedo exploder far beyond the limits of the technology of the time, and had to disable it, and then work on also-unreliable contact fuzing, to make torpedoes more than blunt objects than banged into hulls.

Since water is incompressible, an explosion under the keel of a vessel is far more destructive than one at the air-water interface. Torpedo and mine designers want to place the explosions in that vulnerable spot, and countermeasures designers want to hide the magnetic signature of a vessel. Signature is especially relevant here, as mines may be made selective for warships, merchant vessel unlikely to be hardened against underwater explosions, or submarines.

A basic countermeasure, started in World War II, was degaussing, but it is impossible to remove all magnetic properties.

===Detecting landmines===

Landmines often contain enough ferrous metal to be detectable with appropriate magnetic sensors. Sophisticated mines, however, may also sense a metal-detection oscillator, and, under preprogrammed conditions, detonate to deter demining personnel.

[[File:Detecteur de metal 501607 fh000007.jpg|thumb|Foerster Minex 2FD 4.500 [[Metal detector]] used by the [[French army]].]]

Not all landmines have enough metal to activate a magnetic detector. While, unfortunately, the greatest number of unmapped minefields are in parts of the world that cannot afford high technology, a variety of MASINT sensors could help demining. These would include ground-mapping radar, thermal and multispectral imaging, and perhaps synthetic aperture radar to detect disturbed soil.

==Gravitimetric MASINT==

Gravity is a function of mass. While the average value of Earth's surface gravity is approximately 9.8 meters per second squared, given sufficiently sensitive instrumentation, it is possible to detect local variations in gravity from the different densities of natural materials: the value of gravity will be greater on top of a granite monolith than over a sand beach. Again with sufficiently sensitive instrumentation, it should be possible to detect gravitational differences between solid rock, and rock excavated for a hidden facility.

Streland 2003 points out that the instrumentation indeed must be sensitive:  variations of the force of gravity on the earth’s surface are on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; of the average value. A practical gravitimetric detector of buried facilities would need to be able to measure "less than one one millionth of the force that caused the apple to fall on Sir Isaac Newton’s head." To be practical, it would be necessary for the sensor to be able to be used while in motion, measuring the change in gravity between locations. This change over distance is called the ''gravity gradient'', which can be measured with a gravity gradiometer.&lt;ref name=Streland2003 /&gt;

Developing an operationally useful gravity gradiometer is a major technical challenge.  One type, the [[SQUID]] Superconducting Quantum Interference Device gradiometer, may have adequate sensitivity, but it needs extreme cryogenic cooling, even if in space, a logistic nightmare. Another technique, far more operationally practical but lacking the necessary sensitivity, is the [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) technique, currently using radar to measure the distance between pairs of satellites, whose orbits will change based on gravity.  Substituting lasers for radar will make GRACE more sensitive, but probably not sensitive enough.

A more promising technique, although still in the laboratory, is quantum gradiometry, which is an extension of atomic clock techniques, much like those in GPS. Off-the-shelf atomic clocks measure changes in atomic waves over time rather than the spatial changes measured in a quantum gravity gradiometer. One advantage of using GRACE in satellites is that measurements can be made from a number of points over time, with a resulting improvement as seen in synthetic aperture radar and sonar. Still, finding deeply buried structures of human scale is a tougher problem than the initial goals of finding mineral deposits and ocean currents.

To make this operationally feasible, there would have to be a launcher to put fairly heavy satellites into polar orbits, and as many earth stations as possible to reduce the need for large on-board storage of the large amounts of data the sensors will produce. Finally, there needs to be a way to convert the measurements into a form that can be compared against available signatures in geodetic data bases.  Those data bases would need significant improvement, from measured data, to become sufficiently precise that a buried facility signature would stand out.

A '''grain cradle''' or ''cradle'', is a modification to a standard [[scythe]] to keep the cut grain stems aligned. The cradle scythe has an additional arrangement of fingers attached to the snaith (snath or snathe) to catch the cut grain so that it can be cleanly laid down in a row with the grain heads aligned for collection and efficient threshing.

==History==
[[File:Pojke i Rättviksdräkt med lie. Akvarell av P.Södermark - Nordiska museet - NMA.0070058 (cropped).jpg|thumb|An early Swedish scythe from a painting by Johan Per Sodermark, (1822-1889)]]
[[File:CradlePatent.gif|thumb|upright|American cradle ([[patent drawing]])]]
As the cultivation of grain developed, the seasonal harvest became a major agricultural event. Grain could be pulled or, later, cut with a [[sickle]] and tied into [[sheave]]s to be [[threshing|threshed]]. The scythe improved on the sickle by giving the mower a more [[Ergonomics|ergonomic]] stance and permitting a larger blade. However, keeping the grain stems aligned in the [[windrow]] required great skill and where these skills were less available the addition of a cradle helped to manage the grain heads, reducing the [[sheaf (agriculture)|sheaver]]'s work-load and improving efficiency at [[threshing]]. Lesser skilled mowers could harvest significantly more grain by using the cradle.&lt;ref&gt;"American Grain Cradles", Richard Van Vleck, http://www.americanartifacts.com/smma/grain/cradle.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the grain cradle was in previous use in parts of Europe it was not generally used because skilled labour was traditionally available. Between 1800 to 1840 the cradle was widely adopted in the expanding grain growing area of [[Midwestern United States]], undergoing some refinement there and resulting in the American-pattern cradle{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}&lt;!-- Not clear how this differs from the Scottish invention --&gt;. Fifty American [[patent]]s were issued between 1823 and 1930, the first in 1823 in western New York state and the last in 1924 in West Virginia peaking between 1875 and 1900.&lt;ref&gt;"American Grain Cradles" http://www.americanartifacts.com/smma/grain/decade.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

Hay does not require aligning and the scythe is more efficient without a cradle, so it was removed for haymaking.

==Decline==
The cradle was commonly used throughout the 1800s and into the beginning of the 20th century, in part because many of the smaller farms were not designed for mechanical reaping and in part because there were still a great number of smaller farms where the mechanical reaper was not economical. However, by the end of the 19th century the cradle had been generally replaced by the mechanical [[reaper]], a horse-drawn (or tractor-drawn) machine patented by [[Cyrus McCormick]] in 1834, and later by other mechanical methods of harvesting such as the [[combine harvester]].

A '''hand sack''' is any sack or similar object, typically made of [[cloth]] and filled with sand or a similar material, that is tossed on the back of the hand in a variety of games.

==Origin==
Hand sack originates from the lighter game, a game often played on college campuses.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Lighter game founded in the greater Burlington Vermont area in the early 90's which spread to the music festival scene and on to college campuses nationwide.

{{Hydraulic fracturing}}
A '''proppant''' is a solid material, typically sand, treated sand or man-made ceramic materials, designed to keep an [[hydraulic fracturing|induced hydraulic fracture]] open, during or following a fracturing treatment. It is added to a ''fracking fluid'' which may vary in composition depending on the type of fracturing used, and can be [[gel]], [[foam]] or [[slickwater]]–based. In addition, there may be unconventional fracking fluids. Fluids make tradeoffs in such material properties as [[viscosity]], where more viscous fluids can carry more concentrated proppant; the energy or pressure demands to maintain a certain flux pump rate ([[flow velocity]]) that will conduct the proppant appropriately; [[pH]], various [[rheology|rheological factors]], among others. In addition, fluids may be used in low-volume well stimulation of high-permeability [[sandstone]] wells (20k to 80k gallons per well) to the high-volume operations such as [[shale gas]] and [[tight gas]] that use millions of gallons of water per well.

Conventional wisdom has often vacillated about the relative superiority of gel, foam and slickwater fluids with respect to each other, which is in turn related to proppant choice. For example, Zuber, Kuskraa and Sawyer (1988) found that gel-based fluids seemed to achieve the best results for [[coalbed methane]] operations,&lt;ref name=mader&gt;{{cite book|last=Mader|first=Detlef|title=Hydraulic proppant fracturing and gravel packing|year=1989|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|location=[[Amsterdam]]|isbn=0-444-87352-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FyGcOI42oBMC&amp;pg=PA473&amp;lpg=PA473}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as of 2012,  slickwater treatments are more popular.

Other than proppant, slickwater fracturing fluids are mostly water, generally 99% or more by volume, but gel-based fluids can see polymers and surfactants comprising as much as 7 vol% , ignoring other additives.  Other common additives include [[hydrochloric acid]] (low pH can [[industrial etching|etch certain rocks]], dissolving [[limestone]] for instance), friction reducers, [[guar gum]], [[biocide]]s, emulsion breakers, [[emulsifier]]s, [[2-butoxyethanol]], and  [[Radionuclides associated with hydraulic fracturing|radioactive tracer]] isotopes.

==Proppant permeability and mesh size==
[[File:USGS Hydraulic Fracturing Sand.jpg|thumb| Sand used for fracturing, USGS, 2012]]
Proppants used should be [[gas permeability|permeable or permittive to gas]] under high pressures; the interstitial space between particles should be sufficiently large, yet have the mechanical strength to withstand closure stresses to hold fractures open after the fracturing pressure is withdrawn. [[Mesh size|Large mesh]] proppants have greater permeability than small mesh proppants at low closure stresses, but will mechanically fail (i.e. get crushed) and produce very fine particulates ("fines") at high closure stresses such that smaller-mesh proppants overtake large-mesh proppants in permeability after a certain threshold stress.&lt;ref name=carboceramics&gt;{{cite web|title=Physical Properties of Proppants |url=http://archive.carboceramics.com/English/tools/topical_ref/tr_physical.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130118222434/http://archive.carboceramics.com/English/tools/topical_ref/tr_physical.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 January 2013 |work=CarboCeramics Topical Reference |publisher=CarboCeramics |accessdate=24 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though [[sand]] is a common proppant, untreated sand is prone to significant fines generation; fines generation is often measured in wt% of initial feed. A commercial newsletter from [[Momentive Specialty Chemicals|Momentive]] cites untreated sand fines production to be 23.9% compared with 8.2% for lightweight ceramic and 0.5% for their product.&lt;ref name=Momentive&gt;{{cite web|title=Critical Proppant Selection Factors|url=http://www.momentivefracline.com/critical-proppant-selection-factors|work=Fracline|publisher=Hexion}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One way to maintain an ideal mesh size (i.e. permeability) while having sufficient strength is to choose proppants of sufficient strength; sand might be coated with resin,to form [[CRCS]] (Curable Resin Coated Sand) or PRCS (Pre-Cured Resin Coated Sands). In certain situations a different proppant material might be chosen altogether—popular alternatives include [[ceramic]]s and sintered [[bauxite]].

==Proppant weight and strength==

Increased strength often comes at a cost of increased density, which in turn demands higher flow rates, viscosities or pressures during fracturing, which translates to increased fracturing costs, both environmentally and economically.&lt;ref name=rickards&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rickards|first=Allan|title=High Strength, Ultralightweight Proppant Lends New Dimensions to Hydraulic Fracturing Applications|journal=[[Society of Petroleum Engineers|SPE]] Production &amp; Operations| date=May 2006 |volume=21|issue=2|pages=212–221|url=http://www.spe.org/ejournals/jsp/journalapp.jsp?pageType=Preview&amp;jid=EPF&amp;mid=SPE-84308-PA|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lightweight proppants conversely are designed to be lighter than sand (~2.5&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and thus allow pumping at lower pressures or fluid velocities. Light proppants are less likely to settle. Porous materials can break the strength-density trend, or even afford greater gas permeability. Proppant geometry is also important; certain shapes or forms amplify stress on proppant particles making them especially vulnerable to crushing (a sharp discontinuity can classically allow infinite stresses in linear elastic materials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guimaraes|first=M. S.|title=Aggregate production: Fines generation during rock crushing|journal=Journal of Mineral Processing|year=2007|url=http://pmrl.ce.gatech.edu/papers/Guimaraes_2007a.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proppant deposition and post-treatment behaviours==

Proppant mesh size also affects fracture length: proppants can be "bridged out" if the fracture width decreases to less than twice the size of the diameter of the proppant.&lt;ref name=carboceramics /&gt; As proppants are deposited in a fracture, proppants can resist further fluid flow or the flow of other proppants, inhibiting further growth of the fracture. In addition, closure stresses (once external fluid pressure is released) may cause proppants to reorganise or "squeeze out" proppants, even if no fines are generated, resulting in smaller effective width of the fracture and decreased permeability. Some companies try to cause weak bonding at rest between proppant particles in order to prevent such reorganisation. The modelling of fluid dynamics and rheology of fracturing fluid and its carried proppants is a subject of active research by the industry.

==Proppant costs==

Though good proppant choice positively impacts output rate and overall ultimate recovery of a well, commercial proppants are also constrained by cost. Transport costs from supplier to site form a significant component of the cost of proppants.

==Other components of fracturing fluids==

Other than proppant, slickwater fracturing fluids are mostly water, generally 99% or more by volume, but gel-based fluids can see polymers and surfactants comprising as much as 7 vol% , ignoring other additives.&lt;ref name=epahodge&gt;{{cite web|last=Hodge|first=Richard|title=Crosslinked and Linear Gel Comparison|url=http://www.epa.gov/hfstudy/cross-linkandlineargelcomposition.pdf|work=EPA HF Study Technical Workshop|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency]]|accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common additives include [[hydrochloric acid]] (low pH can [[industrial etching|etch certain rocks]], dissolving [[limestone]] for instance), friction reducers, [[guar gum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/blogs/regblog/2012/08/8-narayan-guar-gum.html |title=From Food to Fracking: Guar Gum and International Regulation |author=Ram Narayan |date=8 August 2012 |work=RegBlog |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Law School]] |accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[biocide]]s, emulsion breakers, [[emulsifier]]s, and [[2-Butoxyethanol]].

[[Radionuclides associated with hydraulic fracturing|Radioactive tracer]] isotopes are sometimes included in the hydrofracturing fluid to determine the injection profile and location of fractures created by hydraulic fracturing.&lt;ref name="Reis iodine"&gt;Reis, John C.

In the US, except for diesel-based additive fracturing fluids, noted by the American [[Environmental Protection Agency]] to have a higher proportion of [[volatile organic compound]]s and carcinogenic [[BTEX]], use of fracturing fluids in hydraulic fracturing operations was explicitly excluded from regulation under the American [[Clean Water Act]] in 2005, a legislative move that has since attracted controversy for being the product of special interests lobbying.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

While lotion may be used as a medicine delivery system, many lotions, especially '''hand lotions''' and '''body lotions''' are meant instead to simply smooth, moisturize and soften the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soaps &amp; Lotions|url=http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Products/ucm388824.htm|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may be used in anti-aging lotions, which can also be classified as a cosmetic in many cases, and may contain fragrances. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] voiced concern about lotions not classified as drugs that advertise anti-aging or anti-wrinkle properties.&lt;ref name="fragrances" /&gt;&lt;ref name="antiaging"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrinkle Treatments and Other Anti-aging Products|url=http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Products/ucm388826.htm|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medicine delivery ==
Dermatologists can prescribe lotions to treat or prevent skin diseases.&lt;ref name="Remington2006"/&gt; It is not unusual for the same drug ingredient to be formulated into a lotion, [[cream (pharmaceutical)|cream]] and [[ointment]]. Creams are the most convenient of the three but are inappropriate for application to regions of hairy skin such as the scalp, while a lotion is less viscous and may be readily applied to these areas (many medicated [[shampoos]] are in fact lotions). Historically, lotions also had an advantage in that they may be spread thinly compared to a cream or ointment and may economically cover a large area of skin, but product research has steadily eroded this distinction. [[Acne cosmetica|Non-comedogenic]] lotions are recommended for use on acne prone skin.

Lotions can be used for the delivery to the skin of medications such as:
* [[Antibiotic]]s
* [[Antiseptic]]s
* [[Antifungal medication|Antifungals]]
* [[Corticosteroid]]s
* Anti-[[Acne vulgaris|acne]] agents
* Soothing, smoothing, moisturizing or protective agents (such as [[calamine]])

== Occupational use ==
Since health care workers must wash their hands frequently to prevent disease transmission, hospital grade lotion is recommended to prevent skin [[dermatitis]] caused by frequent exposure to cleaning agents in the soap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hand Dermatitis in Health Care Workers|url=http://www.lni.wa.gov/safety/research/dermatitis/files/derm_hcw.pdf|website=Washington State Department of Labor and Industries|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 study found that application of hospital grade lotion after hand washing significantly reduced skin roughness and dryness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regular use of a hand cream can attenuate skin dryness and roughness caused by frequent hand washing|pmc=1397860|website=National Center for Biotechnology Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Care must be taken not to use consumer lotions in a hospital environment, as the perfumes and allergens may be a danger to those who are immunodeficient.&lt;ref name="fragrances"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fragrances in Cosmetics|url=http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Ingredients/ucm388821.htm|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Kirsten M.|last2=Littau|first2=Cheryl A.|title=Keep consumer hand lotions at home|url=http://www.americannursetoday.com/keep-consumer-hand-lotions-at-home/|website=American Nurse Today|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Most lotions are oil-in-water [[emulsion]]s using a substance such as [[cetearyl alcohol]] to keep the emulsion together, but water-in-oil lotions are also formulated. The key components of a skin care lotion, cream or gel emulsion (that is mixtures of oil and water) are the [[Wiktionary:aqueous|aqueous]] and oily phases, an [[Emulsion#Emulsifiers|emulgent]] to prevent separation of these two phases, and, if used, the [[medication|drug]] substance or substances. A wide variety of other ingredients such as [[fragrance]]s, [[glycerin|glycerol]], [[petroleum jelly]], [[dye]]s, [[preservative]]s, [[protein]]s and stabilizing agents are commonly added to lotions.

Since thickness and consistency are key factors in lotions and creams, it is important to understand the manufacturing process that determines viscosity.

Manufacturing lotions and creams can be completed in two cycles:
#Emollients and lubricants are dispersed in oil with blending and thickening agents.
#Perfume, color and preservatives are dispersed in the water cycle. Active ingredients are broken up in both cycles depending on the raw materials involved and the desired properties of the lotion or cream.

A typical oil-in-water manufacturing process might go like this:
*Step 1: Add flake/powder ingredients to the oil being used to prepare the oil phase.
*Step 2: Disperse active ingredients.
*Step 3: Prepare the water phase containing emulsifiers and stabilizers.
*Step 4: Mix the oil and water to form an emulsion. (Note: This is aided by heating to between 110-185 F (45-85 C) depending on the formulation and viscosity desired.)
*Step 5: Continue mixing until the end product is completed

Careful note should be taken in choosing the right mixing equipment for lotion manufacturing to avoid agglomerates and long processing times. It can make all the difference in manufacturing time and costs. Conventional agitators can present a number of problems including agglomerates and longer processing times. On the other hand, high shear in-line mixers can produce quality lotions and creams without many of the complications encountered with conventional mixers. Sonolation is also a process that is growing in popularity.

== Potential health risks ==

=== Acne ===
Depending on their composition, lotions can be comedogenic, meaning that they can result in the increased formation of [[Comedo|comedones]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://myrxtx.ca/new/documents/MA_CHAPTER/en/psc1160|title=Acne|last=Sibbald|first=Debra|date=October 2016|website=RxTx|publisher=Canadian Pharmacists Association|location=Ottawa, ON|publication-place=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufferers of [[acne]], or those who are predisposed to forming comedones, should look for formulations that are designed to be noncomedogenic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Systemic absorption ===
All topical products, including lotions, can result in the [[Absorption (skin)|percutaneous absorption]] of their contents. Though this has limited use as a route of drug administration, it more commonly results in unintended, and often undesirable, consequences. For example, medicated lotions such as [[Diprolene]] are often used with the intention of exerting only [[Route of administration#Local or systemic effect|local effects]], but absorption of the drug through the skin can occur to a small degree, resulting in systemic side effects such as [[hyperglycemia]] and [[glycosuria]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/5004842|title=Betamethasone (Topical)|last=|first=|date=April 21, 2017|website=Lexicomp Online|publisher=Lexi-Comp, Inc.|location=Hudson, OH|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absorption is increased when lotions are applied and then covered with an [[Occlusive dressing|occlusive]] layer, when they are applied to large areas of the body, or when they are applied to damaged or broken skin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Cancer ===
A 2015 study funded by the California Breast Cancer Research Program found that [[paraben]]s, a common ingredient in cosmetic lotions, stimulate breast cancer cell proliferation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/10/27/lotion-ingredient-paraben-may-be-more-potent-carcinogen-than-thought/|title=Lotion ingredient paraben may be more potent carcinogen than thought|website=Berkely News|last1=Sanders|first1=Robert|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/14-09200/|title=Parabens and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Ligands Cross-Talk in Breast Cancer Cells|website=Environmental Health Perspectives|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://silentspring.org/research-update/lower-doses-common-product-ingredient-might-increase-breast-cancer-risk|title=Lower doses of common product ingredient might increase breast cancer risk.|website=Silent Sprint Institute|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allergens ===
There is currently no regulation over use of the term "hypoallergenic", and even pediatric skin products with the label were found to still contain allergens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parsons|first1=Julia|title=Protect children’s skin from unregulated term 'hypoallergenic'|url=https://www.bcm.edu/news/skin-and-hair/protect-kids-from-unregulated-hypoallergenic|website=BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE NEWS|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schlichte|first1=Megan J.|last2=Katta|first2=Rajani|title=Methylisothiazolinone: An Emergent Allergen in Common Pediatric Skin Care Products|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/drp/2014/132564/|website=Dermatology Research and Practice|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with [[eczema]] are especially vulnerable to an allergic reaction with lotion, as their compromised skin barrier allows preservatives to bind with and activate immune cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doyle|first1=Kathryn|title=Some skin creams bad news for eczema|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-skin-creams-eczema-idUSBRE9BB14720131212|website=Reuters|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology]] warns that natural lotion containing ingredients commonly found in food (such as goats milk, cow's milk, coconut milk, or oil) may introduce new allergies, and an allergic reaction when those foods are later consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=Melissa|title=Researchers find link between natural lotions, new food allergies|url=http://www.aaaai.org/about-the-aaaai/newsroom/news-releases/natural-lotions.aspx|website=American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on the body's natural process ==
Lotions are mainly intended to help the skin, but can also harm your skin. Christina Marino, who practices at Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, has conducted much research on this aspect. Moisturizers contain ingredients that are either occlusive or humectant. Occlusive agents are used to help block the loss of water from the skin. Humectant agents are used to attract water to the skin. Significant water exposure to the skin can cause the loss of soluble natural factors. Persistent moisturization to the skin from exposure to water may contribute to an allergic reaction or irritant contact dermatitis, and can result in penetration of foreign objects. Changes in the skin's normal ecological environment, in or on the skin, can support the overgrowth of pathological organisms. Lotions contain 65-85% of water. Water acts as an agent to disperse the active and inactive ingredients in the lotion. A high water content also serves as a way for the absorption of some components and evaporation of the moisturizer. Water acts as a temporary hydration agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marino|first=Christina|date=2006|title=Skin Physiology, Irritants, Dry Skin and Moisturizers|url=http://www.lni.wa.gov/Safety/Research/Dermatitis/files/skin_phys.pdf|journal=Skin Physiology, Irritants, Dry Skin and Moisturizers|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6881">A '''low-level windshear alert system''' (LLWAS) measures average surface [[wind speed]] and [[Wind direction|direction]] using a network of [[Remote sensing|remote sensor]] stations, situated near runways and along approach or departure corridors at an airport. [[Wind shear]] is the generic term for wind differences over an operationally short distance (in relation to flight) which encompass meteorological phenomena including [[gust front]]s, [[microburst]]s, vertical shear, and [[derecho]]s.

==Background==
LLWAS compares results over its operating area to determine whether calm, steady winds, wind shifts (in relation to runways), wind gusts, divergent winds, sustained divergent winds (indicative of shear), or strong and sustained divergent winds (indicative of microbursts) are observed. A LLWAS master station polls each remote station every system cycle (nominally every ten seconds) and provides prevailing airport wind averages, runway specific winds, gusts, may set new wind shear alerts or microburst alerts and reset countdown timers of elapsed time since the last alert. By airline rules, pilots must avoid microbursts if warnings are issued by an automated wind shear detection system, and must wait until a safe time interval passes, to assure departure or landing conditions are safe for the performance of the airframe. Pilots may decide whether to land (or conduct a missed approach) after wind shear alerts are issued. LLWAS wind shear alerts are defined as wind speed gain or loss of between 20 and 30 knots aligned with the active runway direction. "Low level" refers to altitudes of {{convert|2000|ft|m|abbr=on}} or less above ground level (AGL). Arriving aircraft on descent, generally within six nautical miles of touchdown will fly within this low level, maintaining a glide slope and may lack recovery altitude sufficient to avoid a [[Stall (flight)|stall]] or flight-into-terrain if caught unaware by a microburst. LLWAS microburst alerts are issued for greater than 30 knot loss of airspeed at the runway or within three nautical miles of approach or two nautical miles of departure. Microbursts in excess of 110 knots have been observed.    

Each LLWAS equipped airport may have as few as six or as many as thirty-two remote stations. Each remote station uses a {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall pole with [[anemometer]] and radio-telecommunication equipment mounted on a lowerable ring. Remote station wind measurements are transmitted to a master station at the [[Air Traffic Control Tower]] (ATCT), which polls the remote stations, runs wind shear and gust front [[algorithm]]s, and generates warnings when windshear or microburst conditions are detected. Current observations and warnings are displayed for approach controllers in the [[terminal radar approach control facility]] (TRACON) and for local and ground controllers in the air traffic control tower.

[[Air traffic controller]] (ATC) users at local, ground and departure positions in the ATCT relay the LLWAS runway specific alerts to pilots via voice radio communication. Recent wind shear alerts may also feature in radio broadcasts by the automated terminal information system (ATIS). LLWAS wind shear and microburst alerts assist pilots during busy times on final approach and on departure, often when heavy traffic, low ceilings, obstructions to vision, and moderate to heavy [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] add to the difficulty in determining in just a few seconds whether mounting wind and weather hazards should be risked or avoided.

==Related activities in the United States==
The original LLWAS system (LLWAS I) was developed by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) in 1976 in response to the 1975 [[Eastern Air Lines Flight 66]] windshear accident in New York. LLWAS I used a center field anemometer along with five pole mounted anemometers sited around the periphery of a single runway. It was installed at 110 FAA towered airports between 1977 and 1987. Windshear was detected using a simple vector difference algorithm, triggering an alarm when the magnitude of the difference vector between the center field anemometer and any of the five remotes exceeded 15 knots. The LLWAS II deployment included software and hardware upgrades to the existing LLWAS I to improve the windshear detection and reduce false alarms. Between 1988 and 1991, all of the LLWAS I systems were upgraded to be LLWAS II compliant. Windshear deployment studies conducted from 1989 through 1994 determined at which LLWAS-II sites weather exposure justified upgrade to a [[weather radar]] ([[Terminal Doppler Weather Radar]] (TDWR) or Weather Systems Processor (WSP)) an LLWAS Network Expansion (LLWAS-NE) or LLWAS-Relocate/Sustain (LLWAS-RS) upgrade, singly or in combination. By 2005 all LLWAS-II had been decommissioned for one of these replacement wind shear detection systems or for two in combination.    

The LLWAS-NE added the ability to cover more than a single runway, using up to 32 remote stations to provide runway specific alerts for parallel and crossing runways at ten large airports in combination with TDWR. The LLWAS-RS further upgrades service at 40 remaining LLWAS-2 operating sites (not justified for a radar solution) to employ LLWAS-NE algorithms and extend service life by 20 years, in part by adding ultrasonic anemometers with no moving parts. The LLWAS-RS program began in response to the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) investigation of the [[USAir Flight 1016]] accident at Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1994. From that accident, a determination was made that LLWAS-II must regain and retain its original capability, often degraded by tree growth and airport construction such as hangars that obstruct or deflect wind near LLWAS remote station sensors.

[[File:Micromv.jpg|thumb|MicroMV camcorder and tape (top) compared to miniDV and Hi8 tapes]]

'''MicroMV''' is a proprietary videotape format introduced in October 2001 by [[Sony]]. It is the smallest videotape format — 70% smaller than MiniDV or about the size of two US [[Quarter (U.S. coin)|quarter]] coins; it is also smaller than a [[Digital8]] or [[DV]] cassette. It was the first helical scan tape system using [[Disk_read-and-write_head#Magnetoresistance_and_giant_magnetoresistance|MR]] read head introduced to the market. Each cassette can hold up to 60 minutes of video.&lt;ref name=length&gt;{{cite web| title=Product: Micro MV Tape| url=http://www.sony.co.uk/product/micro-mv/mgr-60bt| accessdate=22 August 2013| publisher=http://www.sony.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The MicroMV format does not use the "DV25" [[codec]] used by the highly popular [[DV|DV &amp; MiniDV]] videocassette formats. Instead, it uses 12 [[Mbit/s]] [[MPEG-2]] compression, like that used for [[DVD]]s and [[HDV]]. Footage recorded on MicroMV format initially could not be directly edited with mainstream DV editing software such as [[Adobe Premiere]] or Apple [[Final Cut Pro]]; instead Sony supplied its own [[video editing software]] [[MovieShaker]] (for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] PCs only). Later versions of Ulead Video Studio and several freeware applications however could capture and edit from Sony MicroMV Camcorders.

MicroMV has not been a successful format. Sony was the only electronics manufacturer to sell MicroMV cameras. In 2006, Sony stopped offering new MicroMV camcorder models.&lt;ref name="derStandard"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://derstandard.at/2000025414411/Sony-Das-Ende-von-Betamax-naht |title=Sony: Das Ende von Betamax naht |last=m.b.H. |first=STANDARD Verlagsgesellschaft |date=2015-11-10 |website=derStandard.at |access-date=2017-08-03 |quote=The last camcorder with MicroMV was discontinued in early 2006.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, Sony announced that shipment of MicroMV cassettes would be discontinued in March 2016.&lt;ref name='tele'&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/sony/11986020/Sony-is-finally-killing-off-Betamax-video-tapes.html|quote="Sony will end the shipment of Betamax video cassettes and micro MV cassettes in March 2016," the company said in a Japanese-language statement on its website.|website=The Telegraph|date=2015-11-10|accessdate=2015-11-15|title=Sony is finally killing off Betamax video tapes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151110052125/http://www.sony.co.jp/SonyInfo/News/Press/201511/15-1110/index.html|url=http://www.sony.co.jp/SonyInfo/News/Press/201511/15-1110/index.html|language=Japanese|trans-title=Beta video cassette and micro MV cassette tape shipment end of announcement|quote=ソニーは2016年3月※をもって、ベータビデオカセットおよびマイクロMVカセットの出荷を終了いたします。 ("Sony with a ?

The '''Ministry of Energy''' is a [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] in [[Zambia]]. It is headed by the Minister of Energy.

In 2012 the Ministry of Water and Energy was merged with the [[Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development|Ministry of Mines]] to form the Ministry of Mines Energy and Water Development. The merger was reversed in 2015, with the Ministry of Energy and Water Development coming into being.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.daily-mail.co.zm/zambia-needs-well-defined-roles-ministries/ Zambia needs well-defined roles for ministries] Daily Mail, 19 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Water Development was transferred to the new [[Ministry of Water Development, Sanitation and Environmental Protection]].

The '''National States Geographic Information Council''', known as NSGIC, is an organization in the [[United States of America]] of the states, the District of Columbia, and the territories that works to improve the use and sharing of geospatial data and [[GIS]] tools.&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2000/of00-325/lambert.html&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the organization is "to encourage effective and efficient government through the coordinated development of geographic information and technologies to ensure that information may be integrated at all levels of government."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=517&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
NSGIC members include state GIS coordinators and senior state GIS managers, representatives of federal agencies, local and county governments, the private sector, the academic sector, and other professional organizations. Among the NSGIC membership are experts, recognized nationally and internationally, in GIS, in IT policy, and in data creation and data management.

==Goals==
NSGIC works to foster the creation of "intelligent maps and databases that enable public and private decision makers to make better informed and timelier decisions in a wide array of governmental areas."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsgic.org/about/index.cfm NSGIC web site: about]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the major focus areas of NSGIC are:
* Support for [[OMB_Circular_A-16#NSDI|The National Spatial Data Infrastructure]] (NSDI).
* Establishing well-planned, comprehensive, nation-scale "For the Nation" data initiatives such as [http://www.nsgic.org/hottopics/imageryforthenation.cfm Imagery for the Nation] and Transportation for the Nation.
* Creating standards and a national approach to [http://www.nsgic.org/hottopics/Addresses_FTN_081808_FINAL.pdf address location data].
* Bringing all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and the territories up to [http://www.nsgic.org/hottopics/fifty_states.cfm a common standard of GIS coordination].

==Meetings and Communication==
NSGIC members gather in person twice each year; once in early spring for a Mid-Year Meeting and once in the early fall for an Annual Conference. Mid-Year meetings are held in [[Annapolis]], [[Maryland]] and include meetings with federal leaders on [[Capitol Hill]]. [http://www.nsgic.org/events/archives.cfm NSGIC Annual Conferences] have been held since 1991 and rotate among the states. 

The NSGIC Board of Directors meets monthly by conference call. Several standing committees and special workgroups meet by conference call monthly, or as needed.

The membership is kept informed via a NSGIC [[Electronic_mailing_list|e-mail list]], a [http://www.nsgic.org/ NSGIC web site], and a [http://www.nsgic.org/blog/ NSGIC Blog].

In [[software development]], a '''neutral build''' is a [[software build]] that reflects the current state of the [[source code]] checked into the source code [[version control system]] by the developers, and done in a neutral environment (an environment not used for development).

A [[nightly build]] is a neutral build that takes place automatically. These typically take place when no one is likely to be working in the office so that there are no changes to the [[source code]] during the build. The results of the build are inspected by the arriving programmers, who generally place a priority on ensuring the recent changes to the source code have not broken the build process or functionality of the software. Nightly builds also ensure that the build tools have not broken due to system updates, and are therefore often run whether any source code has changed or not.

In contrast, [[continuous integration]] environments automatically rebuild the project whenever changes are checked in – often several times a day – and provide more immediate feedback; however, they do not necessarily include nightly builds.  As a result, compiler and tool updates may break the ability to compile older projects easily without warning. Nonetheless, CI techniques are considered the more modern approach. CI jobs are often run on isolated [[virtual machines]], and typically include automated testing as well.

When someone says a developer "broke the build", they are effectively saying that a developer checked in code which might very well have compiled (and hopefully also run properly) in their account, but does not compile (and therefore, cannot be run) in anyone else's account. This is typically due to additional developer-specific changes that were either not checked in, or (in the case of [[environment variable]]s, etc.) were modifications to systems not under [[version control system|revision control]].  One of the most common cases is remembering to check in all ''modified'' files, but forgetting to add ''newly created'' files to the repository. If the other developers check out the new code without being aware of the problem, their work may grind to a halt while they wait for the problem to be fixed (or try to fix it themselves, which can be even more problematic, if multiple developers attempt to fix the issue at the same time). This naturally can result in a significant loss of productivity.

Neutral builds are important for [[software development]] processes running at high loads with short schedules (see [[extreme programming]], [[Startup company|startup]]). Not having them means that any build that needs to be created for the [[software quality assurance]] department will use code that may be in the middle of major modifications, and which is therefore best left out of a build intended for independent validation – particularly a build being evaluated for possible release.

==Hazards==

Some obstacles to a reliable neutral build process are:

* Getting a consistent [[Build automation|build automation system]] and set of project control files.
* Having the same [[operating system]] and tools setup as the development machines.
* Set up a checkout procedure that ensures all files are up to date. This may imply the additional task of integrating a [[version control system]] with the process.
* Decoupling the build process from specific [[Integrated development environment|IDEs]].
* Setting up adequate feedback from the build system so that failed builds can be diagnosed.
* Convincing management of the benefit of automated builds.

'''New Formalism''' is an [[architectural style]] that emerged in the United States during the mid 1950s and flowered in the 1960s. Buildings designed in that style exhibited many Classical elements including "strict symmetrical elevations"&lt;ref&gt;Wiffen, Marcus, American Architecture Since 1780: A Guide to the Styles, The M.I.T. Press, Cambridge Massachusetts, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; building proportion and scale, Classical columns, highly stylized [[entablature]]s and colonnades.  The style was used primarily for high-profile cultural, institutional and civic buildings. They were "typically constructed using rich materials such as marble, granite or man-made composites and also incorporated certain qualities of concrete that allowed for the creation of distinctive forms such as umbrella shells, waffle slabs and folded plates".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musiccenter.org/about/About-The-Music-Center/Trivia/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011114909/http://www.musiccenter.org/about/About-The-Music-Center/Trivia/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-10-11|title=Music Center - Architecture and Design of The Music Center|work=musiccenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Edward Durrell Stone]]'s New Delhi American Embassy (1954), which blended the architecture of the east with modern western concepts, is considered to be the symbolic start of New Formalism architecture.&lt;ref name="fullertonheritage.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullertonheritage.org/Resources/archstyles/formalism.htm|title=Architectural Styles in Fullerton: New Formalism|work=fullertonheritage.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Common features of the New Formalism style, include:
* Use of traditionally rich materials, such as [[travertine]], marble, and granite or man-made materials that mimic their luxurious qualities
* Buildings usually set on a podium
* Designed to achieve modern monumentality
* Embraces classical precedents, such as arches, colonnades, classical columns and entablatures
* Smooth wall surfaces
* Delicacy of details
* Formal landscape; use of pools, fountains, sculpture within a central plaza"&lt;ref name="fullertonheritage.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8053">'''Non linear piezoelectric effects in polar semiconductors''' are the manifestation that the strain induced piezoelectric polarization depends not just on the product of the first order piezoelectric coefficients times the strain tensor components but also on the product of the second order (or higher) piezoelectric coefficients times products of the strain tensor components. The idea was put forward for zincblende GaAs and InAs semiconductors since 2006, and then extended to all commonly used [[wurtzite]] and [[zincblende]] semiconductors. Given the difficulty of finding direct experimental evidence for the existence of these effects, there are different schools of thought on how one can calculate reliably all the piezoelectric coefficients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Review of Non Linear Piezoelectricity in Semiconductors |first=Max |last=Migliorato |journal=AIP Conference Proceedings|volume=1590 |issue= |pages=32–41 |doi=10.1063/1.4870192|display-authors=etal|conference=&lt;!--AIP Conference Proceedings--&gt; |year=2014 |bibcode=2014AIPC.1590...32M }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, there is widespread agreement on the fact that non linear effects are rather large and comparable to the linear terms (first order). Indirect experimental evidence of the existence of these effects has been reported in the literature in relation to GaN and InN semiconductor optoelectronic devices.

==History==
Non linear piezoelectric effects in polar semiconductors were first reported in 2006 by G.Bester et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Importance of Second-Order Piezoelectric Effects in Zinc-Blende Semiconductors|first=Gabriel |last=Bester |author2=X. Wu |author3=D. Vanderbilt |author4=A. Zunger |journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=96 |issue= 18|pages=187602 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.187602 |bibcode=2006PhRvL..96r7602B |pmid=16712396|year=2006 |arxiv=cond-mat/0604596}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by M.A. Migliorato et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Composition and strain dependence of the piezoelectric coefficients in InxGa1−xAs alloys|first=Max |last=Migliorato |author2=D. Powell|author3=A.G. Cullis |author4=T. Hammerschmidt|author5=G.P. Srivastava|journal=Physical Review B|volume=74 |issue= 24|pages=245332 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.74.245332|year=2006 |bibcode=2006PhRvB..74x5332M }}&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to [[zincblende]] [[GaAs]] and [[InAs]]. Different methods were used in the seminal papers and while the influence of second (and third) order piezoelectric coefficients was generally recognized as being comparable to first order, fully ab initio and what is currently known as Harrison's model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Electronic Structure and Properties of Solids|first=Walter |last=Harrison|publisher=Dover Publications Inc |location=New York |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared to predict slightly different results, particularly for the magnitude of the first order coefficients.

==Formalism==
While first order piezoelectric coefficients are of the form e&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;, the second and third order coefficients are in the form of a higher rank tensor, expressed as e&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt; and e&lt;sub&gt;ijkl&lt;/sub&gt;. The piezoelectric polarization would then be expressed in terms of products of the piezoelectric coefficients and strain components, products of two strain components, and products of three strain components for the first, second and third order approximation respectively.

==Available Non Linear Piezoelectric Coefficients==
Since 2006 many more articles were published on the subject. Non linear piezoelectric coefficients are now available for many different semiconductor materials and crystal structures:

Particularly for [[III-N]] semiconductors, the influence of non linear [[piezoelectricity]] was discussed in the context of [[light-emitting diode]]s:

In computing, an '''open platform''' describes a [[software system]] which is based on [[open standard]]s, such as published and fully documented external [[application programming interface]]s (API) that allow using the software to function in other ways than the original programmer intended, without requiring modification of the source code. Using these interfaces, a third party could integrate with the platform to add functionality.&lt;ref name="eisenmann2008"/&gt; The opposite is a [[closed platform]].

An open platform does not mean it is [[open source]], however most open platforms have multiple implementations of APIs. For example, [[Common Gateway Interface]] (CGI) is implemented by open source [[web server]]s as well as [[Microsoft Internet Information Server]] (IIS). An open platform can consist of software components or modules that are either proprietary or open source or both. It can also exist as a part of closed platform, such as CGI, which is an open platform, while many servers that implement CGI also have other [[proprietary software|proprietary parts]] that are not part of the open platform.

An open platform implies that the vendor allows, and perhaps supports, the ability to do this. Using an open platform a developer could add features or functionality that the platform vendor had not completed or had not conceived of. An open platform allows the developer to change existing functionality, as the specifications are publicly available open standards.

A [[service-oriented architecture]] allows applications, running as services, to be accessed in a distributed computing environment, such as between multiple systems or across the Internet. A major focus of Web services is to make functional building blocks accessible over standard Internet protocols that are independent from platforms and programming languages. An open SOA platform would allow anyone to access and interact with these building blocks.

A 2008 paper from the [[Harvard Business School]] differentiated a platform's openness in four aspects and gave example platforms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28565">{{For|general lens design|Optical lens design}}
The design of [[photographic lens]]es for use in still or [[cine]] [[camera]]s is intended to produce a lens that yields the most acceptable rendition of the subject being [[photography|photographed]] within a range of constraints that include cost, weight and materials. For many other optical devices such as [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s and [[theodolite]]s where the visual image is observed but often not recorded the design can often be significantly simpler than is the case in a camera where every image is captured on [[film]] or [[image sensor]] and can be subject to detailed scrutiny at a later stage. Photographic lenses also include those used in [[enlarger]]s and projectors.

==Design==

===Design requirements===
{{main article|Optical lens design}}
From the perspective of the photographer, the ability of a [[lens (optics)|lens]] to capture sufficient light so that the camera can operate over a wide range of lighting conditions is important. Designing a lens that reproduces colour accurately is also important as is the production of an evenly lit and sharp image over the whole of the film or sensor plane.

For the lens designer, achieving these objectives will also involve ensuring that internal [[Lens flare|flare]], optical  [[Optical aberration|aberrations]] and weight are all reduced to the minimum whilst [[zoom lens|zoom]], [[focus (optics)|focus]] and [[aperture]] functions all operate smoothly and predictably.

However, because photographic films and electronic sensors have a finite and measurable resolution, photographic lenses are not always designed for maximum possible resolution since the recording medium would not be able to record the level of detail that the lens could resolve. For this, and many other reasons, camera lenses are unsuited  for use as [[Slide projector|projector]] or [[enlarger]] lenses.

The design of a [[Fixed focus|fixed focal length]] lens (also known as ''[[prime lens]]es'') presents fewer challenges than the design of a zoom lens. A high-quality prime lens whose focal length is about equal to the diameter of the film frame or sensor may be constructed from as few as four separate lens elements, often as pairs on either side of the aperture diaphragm. Good examples include the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] [[Tessar]] or the [[Esselte Leitz GmbH &amp; Co KG|Leitz]] [[Tessar#Leitz Elmar|Elmar]].

====Design constraints====
To be useful in photography any lens must be able to fit the camera for which it is intended and this will physically limit the size where the [[bayonet mount]]ing or [[Lens mount|screw mounting]] is to be located.

Photography is a highly competitive commercial business and both weight and cost constrain the production of lenses.

Refractive materials such as glass have physical limitations which limit the performance of lenses. In particular the range of refractive indices available in commercial glasses span a very narrow range. Since it is the [[refractive index]] that determines how much the rays of light are bent at each interface and since it is the differences in refractive indices in paired plus and minus lenses that constrains the ability to minimise [[chromatic aberration]]s, having only a narrow spectrum of indices is a major design constraint.

===Lens elements===
[[File:Revuenon 28mm 1-3,5 dismantled.jpg|thumb|Elements of a cheap 28mm lens.]]
{{main article|Lens (optics)}}
Except for the most simple and inexpensive lenses, each complete lens is made up from a number of separate lens elements arranged along a common axis. The use of many lens elements serves to minimise aberrations and to provide a sharp image free from visible imperfections. To do this requires lens elements of different compositions and different shapes. To minimise chromatic aberrations, e.&amp;nbsp;g., in which different wavelengths of light are refracted to different degrees, requires, at a minimum, a doublet of lens elements with a positive element having a high [[Abbe number]] matched with a negative element of lower Abbe number. With this design one can achieve a good degree of convergence of different wavelengths in the [[visible spectrum]]. Most lens designs do not attempt to bring [[infrared]] wavelengths to the same common focus and it is therefore necessary to manually alter the focus when photographing in infrared light. Other kinds of aberrations like [[Coma (optics)|coma]] or [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatism]] can also be minimized by combining different lens elements. Complex photographic lenses can consist of more than 15 lens elements.

Most lens elements are made with curved surfaces with a [[sphere|spherical]] profile. That is, the curved shape would fit on the surface of a sphere. This is partly to do with the history of lens making but also because grinding and manufacturing of spherical surface lenses is relatively simple and cheap. However, spherical surfaces also give rise to lens aberrations and can lead to complicated lens designs of great size. Higher-quality lenses with fewer elements and lower size can be achieved by using [[aspheric lens]]es in which the curved surfaces are not spherical, giving more degrees of freedom to correct aberrations.

====Lens glass====
{{main article|Refraction}}
The majority of photographic lenses have the lens elements made from glass although the use of high-quality plastics is becoming more common in high-quality lenses and has been common in inexpensive cameras for some time. The design of photographic lenses is very demanding as designers push the limits of existing materials to make more versatile, better-quality, and lighter lenses. As a consequence many exotic glasses have been used in modern lens manufacturing. [[Caesium]]&lt;ref&gt;http://specialmetals.chemetall.com/basic.jsp;jsessionid=E7EC988ACA791907FC590ED56D5376F8.ffms29?xml=14B7838C4C8EDCFEC1256EFC005FC3B7&lt;/ref&gt; and [[lanthanum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3615762.html|title=THORIUM-FREE, LANTHANUM BORATE OPTICAL GLASS|author=|date=|website=freepatentsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; glass lenses are now in use because of their high [[refractive index]] and very low dispersion properties. It is also likely that a number of other transition element glasses are in use but manufacturers often prefer to keep their material specification secret to retain a commercial or performance edge over their rivals.

===Focus===
{{main article|Focus (optics)}}
Until recent years focusing of a camera lens to achieve a sharp image on the film plane was achieved by means of a very shallow [[Helix|helical]] thread in the lens mount through which the lens could be rotated moving it closer or further from the film plane. This arrangement, whilst simple to design and construct, has some limitations not least the rotation of the greater part of the lens assembly including the front element. This could be problematical if devices such as [[polarising filter]]s were in use that require maintaining an accurate vertical orientation irrespective of focus distance.

Later developments adopted designs in which internal elements were moved to achieve focus without affecting the outer barrel of the lens or the orientation of the front element.

Many modern cameras now use automatic focusing mechanisms which use [[ultrasonic motor]]s to move internal elements in the lens to achieve optimum focus.

===Aperture control===
{{main article|Aperture}}
The aperture control, usually a multi-leaf diaphragm, is critical to the performance of a lens. The role of the aperture is to control the amount of light passing through the lens to the film or sensor plane. An aperture placed outside of the lens, as in the case of some [[Victorian era|Victorian]] cameras, risks vignetting of the image in which the corners of the image are darker than the centre. A diaphragm too close to the image plane risks the diaphragm itself being recorded as a circular shape or at the very least causing diffraction patterns at small apertures. In most lens designs the aperture is positioned about midway between the front surface of the objective and the image plane. In some zoom lenses it is placed some distance away from the ideal location in order to accommodate the movement of floating lens elements needed to perform the zoom function.

Most modern lenses for 35mm format rarely provide a stop smaller than f/22 because of the diffraction effects caused by light passing through a very small aperture. As diffraction is based on aperture width in absolute terms rather than the f-stop ratio, lenses for very small formats common in compact cameras rarely go above f/11 (1/1.8") or f/8 (1/2.5"), while lenses for medium- and large-format provide f/64 or f/128.

Very-large-aperture lenses designed to be useful in very low light conditions with apertures ranging from f/1.2 to f/0.9 are generally restricted to lenses of standard focal length because of the size and weight problems that would be encountered in telephoto lenses and the difficulty of building a very wide aperture wide angle lens with the refractive materials currently available. Very-large-aperture lenses are commonly made for other types of optical instruments such as [[microscopes]] but in such cases the diameter of the lens is very small and weight is not an issue.

Many very early cameras had diaphragms external to the lens often consisting of a rotating circular plate with a number of holes of increasing size drilled through the plate.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Rotating the plate would bring an appropriate sized hole in front of the lens. All modern lenses use a multi-leaf diaphragm so that at the central intersection of the leaves a more or less circular aperture is formed. Either a manual ring, or an electronic motor controls the angle of the diaphragm leaves and thus the size of the opening.

The placement of the diaphragm within the lens structure is constrained by the need to achieve even illumination over the whole film plane at all apertures and the requirement to not interfere with the movement of any movable lens element. Typically the diaphragm is situated at about the level of the optical centre of the lens.

===Shutter mechanism===
{{main article|Shutter (photography)}}
A [[shutter (photography)|shutter]] controls the length of time light is allowed to pass through the lens onto the film plane. For any given light intensity, the more sensitive the film or detector or the wider the aperture the shorter the [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] time need to be to maintain the optimal exposure.
In the earliest camera exposures were controlled by moving a rotating plate from in front of the lens and then replacing it. Such a mechanism only works effectively for exposures of several seconds or more and carries a considerable risk of inducing [[camera shake]]. By the end of the 19th century spring tensioned shutter mechanisms were in use operated by a lever or by a [[cable release]]. Some simple shutters continued to be placed in front of the lens but most were incorporated within the lens mount itself.
Such lenses with integral shutter mechanisms developed in the current [[Compur]] shutter as used in many non-reflex cameras such as [[Linhof]]. These shutters have a number of metal leaves that spring open and then close after a pre-determined interval. The material and design constraints limit the shortest speed to about 0.002 second. Although such shutters cannot yield as short an exposure time as [[focal-plane shutter]] they are able to offer [[Flash synchronization|flash synchronisation]] at all speeds.

Incorporating a commercial made Compur type shutter required lens designers to accommodate the width of the shutter mechanism in the lens mount and provide for the means of triggering the shutter on the lens barrel or transferring this to the camera body by a series of levers as in the [[Minolta]] twin-lens cameras.

The need to accommodate the shutter mechanism within the lens barrel limited the design of wide-angle lenses and it was not until the widespread use of focal-plane shutters that extreme wide-angle lenses were developed.

==Types of lenses==
[[Image:Tessar.png|thumb|Example of a prime lens - Carl Zeiss [[Tessar]].]]
The type of lens being designed is significant in setting the key parameters.
*[[Prime lens]] -  a photographic lens whose focal length is fixed, as opposed to a zoom lens, or that is the primary lens in a combination lens system.
*[[Zoom lens]]es - variable focal length lenses. Zoom lenses cover a range of focal lengths by utilising movable elements within the barrel of the lens assembly. In early [[varifocal lens]] lenses the focus also shifted as the lens focal length was changed. Varifocal lenses are also used in many modern autofocus cameras as the lenses are cheaper and simpler to construct and the autofocus can take care of the re-focussing requirements. Many modern zoom lenses are now ''confocal'', meaning that the focus is maintained throughout the zoom range. Because of the need to operate over a range of focal lengths and maintain confocality, zoom lenses typically have very many lens elements. More significantly, the front elements of the lens will always be a compromise in terms of its size, light-gathering capability and the angle of incidence of the incoming rays of light. For all these reasons, the optical performance of zoom lenses tends to be lower than fixed-focal-length lenses.
*[[Normal lens]] - a lens with a focal length about equal to the diagonal size of the film or sensor format, or that reproduces perspective that generally looks "normal" to a human observer.
[[Image:Symetrical.svg|thumb|Cross-section of a typical short-focus wide-angle lens.]]
*[[Wide angle lens]] - a lens that reproduces perspective that generally looks "wider" than a normal lens. The problem posed by the design of wide-angle lenses is to bring to an accurate focus light from a wide area without causing internal flare. Wide-angle lenses therefore tend to have more elements than a normal lens to help refract the light sufficiently and still minimise aberrations whilst adding light-trapping baffles between each lens element.
[[Image:Angenieux.png|thumb|Cross-section of a typical retrofocus wide-angle lens.]]
:*Extreme or ultra-wide-angle lens - a wide-angle lens with an angle of view above 90 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney F. Ray, Applied photographic optics, page 314&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme-wide-angle lenses share the same issues as ordinary wide-angle lenses but the focal length of such lenses may be so short that there is insufficient physical space in front of the film or sensor plane to construct a lens. This problem is resolved by constructing the lens as an inverted telephoto, or [[Angénieux retrofocus|retrofocus]] with the front element having a very short focal length, often with a highly exaggerated convex front surface and behind it a strongly negative lens grouping that extends the cone of focused rays so that they can be brought to focus at a reasonable distance.
[[Image:Typtelelens.png|thumb|right|300px|Cross-section - typical telephoto lens. &lt;br&gt;'''L1''' - Tele positive lens group &lt;br&gt;'''L2''' - Tele negative lens group &lt;br&gt;'''D''' - Diaphragm]]
*[[Fisheye lens]] - an extreme wide-angle lens with a strongly convex front element. Spherical aberration is usually pronounced and sometimes enhanced for special effect. Optically designed as a reverse telephoto to enable the lens to fit into a standard mount as the focal length can be less than the distance from lens mount to focal plane.
*[[Long-focus lens]] - a lens with a focal length greater than the diagonal of the film frame or sensor. Long focus lenses are relatively simple to design, the challenges being comparable to the design of a prime lens. However, as the focal length increases the length of the lens and the size of the objective increase in size and length and weight quickly become significant design issues in retaining utility and practicality for the lens in use. In addition because the light path through the lens is long and glancing, the importance of baffles to control flare increases in importance.
*[[Telephoto lens]] - an optically compressed version of the long-focus lens. The design of telephoto lenses reduces some of the problems encountered by designers of long-focus lenses. In particular, telephoto lenses are typically much shorter and may be lighter for equivalent focal length and aperture. However telephoto designs increase the number of lens elements and can introduce flare and exacerbate some optical aberrations.
*[[Catadioptric system#Photographic catadioptric lenses|Catadioptric lens]] - catadioptric lenses are a form of telephoto lens but with a light path that doubles back on itself and with an objective that is a mirror combined with some form aberration correcting lens (a [[catadioptric system]]) rather than just a lens. A centrally-placed [[secondary mirror]] and usually an additional small lens group bring the light to focus. Such lenses are very lightweight and can easily deliver very long focal lengths but they can only deliver a fixed aperture and have none of the benefits of being able to stop down the aperture to increase depth of field.
*[[Anamorphic lens]]es are used principally in [[cinematography]] to produce wide-screen films where the projected image has a substantially different ratio of height to width than the image recorded on the film plane. This is achieved by the use of a specialised lens design which compresses the image laterally at the recording stage and the film is then projected through a similar lens in the cinema to recreate the wide-screen effect. Although in some cases the anamorphic effect is achieved by using an anamorphising attachment as a supplementary element on the front of a normal lens, most films shot in anamorphic formats use specially designed anamorphic lenses, such as the Hawk lenses made by Vantage Film or [[Panavision|Panavision's]] anamorphic lenses. These lenses incorporate one or more [[aspheric lens|aspheric elements]] in their design.

===Enlarger lenses===
Lenses used in photographic enlargers are required to focus light passing through a relatively small film area on a larger area of photographic paper or film. Requirements for such lenses include
:*the ability to record even illumination over the whole field
:*to record fine detail present in the film being enlarged
:*to withstand frequent cycles of heating and cooling as the illumination lamp is turned on and off
:*to be able to be operated in the dark - usually by means of click stops and some luminous controls

The design of the lens is required to work effectively with light passing from near focus to far focus - exactly the reverse of a camera lens. This demands that internal light baffling within the lens is designed differently and that the individual lens elements are designed to maximize performance for this change of direction of incident light.

===Projector lenses===
Projector lenses share many of the design constraints as enlarger lenses but with some critical differences. Projector lenses are always used at full aperture and must produce an acceptably illuminated and acceptably sharp image at full aperture.

However, because projected images are almost always viewed at some distance, lack of very fine focus and slight unevenness of illumination is often acceptable. Projector lenses have to be very tolerant of prolonged high temperatures from the projector lamp and frequently have a focal length much longer than the taking lens. This allows the lens to be positioned at a greater distance from the illuminated film and allows an acceptable sized image with the projector some distance from the screen. It also permits the lens to be mounted in a relatively coarsely threaded focusing mount so that the projectionist can quickly correct any focusing errors.

==History==
{{Main article|History of photographic lens design}}
[[Image:Lens Petval 1841.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Diagram of Petzval's 1841 portrait lens - crown glass shaded pink, flint glass shaded blue]]
The lenses of the very earliest cameras were simple meniscus or simple bi convex lenses. It was not until 1840 that Chevalier in France introduced the achromatic lens formed by cementing a [[crown glass (optics)|crown glass]] bi-convex lens to a [[flint glass]] plano-concave lens.
By 1841 [[Voigtländer]] using the design of [[Joseph Petzval]]  manufactured the first commercially successful two element lens.

[[Carl Zeiss]] was an [[entrepreneur]] who needed a competent designer to take his firm beyond just another optical workshop. In 1866, the service of Dr Ernst Abbe was enlisted. From then on novel products appeared in rapid succession which brought the Zeiss company to the forefront of optical technology.

Abbe was instrumental in the development of the famous Jena optical glass. When he was trying to eliminate astigmatism from microscopes, he realised that the range of optical glasses available was insufficient. After some calculations, he realised that performance of optical instruments would dramatically improve, if optical glasses of appropriate properties were available. His challenge to glass manufacturers was finally answered by Dr Otto Schott, who established the famous glassworks at [[Jena]] from which new types of optical glass began to appear from 1888, and employed by Zeiss and other makers.

The new Jena optical glass also opened up the possibility of increased performance of photographic lenses. The first use of Jena glass in a photographic lens was by [[Voigtländer]], but as the lens was an old design its performance was not greatly improved. Subsequently, the new glasses would demonstrate their value in correcting  [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatism]], and in the production of  achromatic and [[apochromatic]] lenses. Abbé started the design of a photographic lens of symmetrical design with five elements, but went no further.

Zeiss' innovative photographic lens design was due to Dr [[Paul Rudolph (physicist)|Paul Rudolph]]. In 1890, Rudolph designed an asymmetrical lens with a cemented group at each side of the diaphragm, and appropriately named "Anastigmat". This lens was made in three series: Series III, IV and V, with maximum apertures of f/7.2, f/12.5, and f/18 respectively. In 1891, Series I, II and IIIa appeared with respective maximum apertures of f/4.5, f/6.3, and f/9 and in 1893 came Series IIa of f/8 maximum aperture. These lenses are now better known by the trademark "Protar" which was first used in 1900.

At the time, single combination lenses, which occupy one side of the diaphragm only, were still popular. Rudolph designed one with three cemented elements in 1893, with the option of fitting two of them together in a lens barrel as a compound lens, but it was found to be the same as the Dagor by [[Goerz (company)|C.P. Goerz]], designed by [[Emil von Höegh]]. Rudolph then came up with a single combination with four cemented elements, which can be considered as having all the elements of the Protar stuck together in one piece. Marketed in 1894, it was called the Protarlinse Series VII, the most highly corrected single combination lens with maximum apertures between f/11 and f/12.5, depending on its focal length.

But the important thing about this Protarlinse is that two of these lens units can be mounted in the same lens barrel to form a compound lens of even greater performance and larger aperture, between f/6.3 and f/7.7. In this configuration it was called the Double Protar Series VIIa. An immense range of focal lengths can thus be obtained by the various combination of Protarlinse units.

Rudolph also investigated the [[Double-Gauss]] concept of a symmetrical design with thin positive meniscii enclosing negative elements. The result was the Planar Series Ia of 1896, with maximum apertures up to f/3.5, one of the fastest lenses of its time. Whilst it was very sharp, it suffered from [[Coma (optics)|coma]] which limited its popularity. However, further developments of this configuration made it the design of choice for high-speed lenses of standard coverage.

Probably inspired by the Stigmatic lenses designed by Hugh Aldis for [[Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer|Dallmeyer]] of London, Rudolph designed a new asymmetrical lens with four thin elements, the Unar Series Ib, with apertures up to f/4.5. Due to its high speed it was used extensively on hand cameras.

The most important Zeiss lens by Rudolph was the [[Tessar]], first sold in 1902 in its Series IIb f/6.3 form. It can be said as a combination of the front half of the Unar with the rear half of the Protar. This proved to be a most valuable and flexible design, with tremendous development potential. Its maximum aperture was increased to f/4.7 in 1917, and reached f/2.7 in 1930. It is probable that every lens manufacturer has produced lenses of the Tessar configuration.

Rudolph left Zeiss after the First World War, but many other competent designers such as Merté, Wandersleb, etc. kept the firm at the leading edge of photographic lens innovations. One of the most significant designer was the ex-Ernemann man [[Ludwig Bertele|Dr Ludwig Bertele]], famed for his Ernostar high-speed lens.

With the advent of the [[Contax]] by Zeiss-Ikon, the first serious challenge to the [[Leica Camera|Leica]] in the field of professional 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras, both Zeiss-Ikon and Carl Zeiss decided to beat the Leica in every possible way. Bertele's [[Zeiss Sonnar|Sonnar]] series of lenses designed for the Contax were the match in every respect for the Leica for at least two decades. Other lenses for the Contax included the Biotar, Biogon, Orthometar, and various Tessars and Triotars.

The last important Zeiss innovation before the Second World War was the technique of applying anti-reflective coating to lens surfaces invented by [[Olexander Smakula]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeiss.com/corporate/en_de/history/company%20history/at-a-glance/at-a-glance-milestones.html#1895-_-1945|title=History of Camera Lenses from Carl Zeiss - 1935 - Alexander Smakula develops anti-reflection coating|author=|date=|website=zeiss.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lens so treated was marked with a red "T", short for "Transparent". The technique of applying multiple layers of coating was also described in the original patent writings in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeiss.com/sports-optics/en_us/hunting/experience/competences/lens-coating.html|title=Lens Coating - ZEISS United States|author=|date=|website=www.zeiss.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the partitioning of Germany, a new Carl Zeiss optical company was established in [[Oberkochen]], while the original Zeiss firm in [[Jena]] continued to operate. At first both firms produced very similar lines of products, and extensively cooperated in product-sharing, but they drifted apart as time progressed. Jena's new direction was to concentrate on developing lenses for the 35&amp;nbsp;mm single-lens reflex camera, and many achievements were made, especially in ultra-wide angle designs. In addition to that, Oberkochen also worked on designing lenses for large format cameras, interchangeable front element lenses such as for the 35&amp;nbsp;mm single-lens reflex Contaflex, and other types of cameras.

Since the beginning of Zeiss as a photographic lens manufacturer, it has had a licensing programme which allows other manufacturers to produce its lenses. Over the years its licensees included [[Voigtländer]], [[Bausch &amp; Lomb]], Ross, Koristka, Krauss, [[Kodak]]. etc. In the 1970s, the western operation of Zeiss-Ikon got together with Yashica to produce the new [[Contax]] cameras, and many of the Zeiss lenses for this camera, among others, were produced by Yashica's optical arm, Tomioka. Yashica's owner [[Kyocera]] ended camera production in 2006. Yashica lenses were then made by [[Cosina]], who also manufactured most of the new Zeiss designs for the new Zeiss Ikon coupled rangefinder camera. Another licensee active today is [[Sony]] who uses the Zeiss name on lenses on its video and digital still cameras.

[[Image:Ventilated wall scheme.jpg|thumb|Air circulating scheme]]

A '''rainscreen''' is an exterior [[wall]] detail where the [[siding]] (wall cladding) stands off from the [[moisture]]-[[Hydraulic conductivity|resistant]] surface of an air barrier applied to the sheathing (sheeting) to create a capillary break and to allow drainage and evaporation. The ''rain screen'' is the siding itself&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/aiaucmp/groups/ek_members/documents/pdf/aiab098384.pdf Micheal J. Lough and David Altenhofen, "The Rain Screen Principle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322013717/http://www.aia.org/aiaucmp/groups/ek_members/documents/pdf/aiab098384.pdf |date=2014-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term rainscreen implies a system of building. Ideally the rain screen prevents the wall air/moisture barrier on sheathing from getting wet. In some cases a rainscreen wall is called a ''pressure-equalized rainscreen'' wall where the ventilation openings are large enough for the air pressure to nearly equalize on both sides of the rain screen,&lt;ref name="Brown" &gt;Brown, W. C, Rousseau, M. Z., and Dalgliesh, W. A., "Field Testing of Pressure-Equalized Rain Screen Walls," Donaldson, Barry, ed.. ''Exterior wall systems: glass and concrete technology, design, and construction''. Philadelphia, PA: ASTM, 1991. 59. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but this name has been criticized as being redundant&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, M.Z., "Facts and Fictions of Rain-Screen Walls", ''Construction Canada'', 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and is only useful to scientists and engineers.

==Definitions==
A ''screen'' in general terms is a barrier.&lt;ref&gt;"Screen" def. 2. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The rainscreen in a wall is sometimes defined as the first layer of material on the wall, the siding itself.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; Also, rainscreen is defined as the entire system of the siding, ''drainage plane'' and a ''moisture/air barrier''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ctu-sc/files/doc/ctu-sc/ctu-n17_eng.pdf ''Pressure Equalization in Rainscreen Wall Systems'', National Research Council of Canada]. Retrieved 2013-12-01&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archinfo.it/whitepaper_library/RainScreenPrinciple.pdf ''The Rainscreen Principle in Design'', National Research Council of Canada]. Retrieved 2013-12-01&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Masonry veneer|veneer]] that does not stand off from the wall sheathing to create a [[cavity wall|cavity]] is not a rainscreen. However, a [[masonry veneer#Rain screens|masonry veneer]] can be a rainscreen wall if it is ventilated&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gobrick.com/Portals/25/docs/Technical%20Notes/TN27.pdf Technical Note 27, ''Brick Masonry Rain Screen Walls''] (pdf file) Brick Industry Association. Retrieved 4 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Many terms have been applied to rain screen walls including basic, open, conventional, pressure-equalized, pressure-moderated rainscreen systems or assemblies. These terms have caused confusion as to what a rain screen is but all reflect the ''rainscreen principle'' of a primary and secondary line of defense. One technical difference is between a plane, a gap of {{convert|3/8|in|mm}} or less and a channel, a gap of more than {{convert|3/8|in|mm}}.

In general terms a rainscreen wall may be called a ''cavity'' or ''drained wall''.&lt;ref name="WBDG" &gt;[http://www.wbdg.org/design/env_wall.php "Building Envelope Design Guide - Wall Systems" in ''Whole Building Design Guide'']&lt;/ref&gt; The two other basic types of exterior walls in terms of water resistance are ''barrier walls'' which rely on the one exterior surface to prevent ingress and ''mass walls'' which allow but absorb some leakage.&lt;ref name="WBDG"/&gt;

==History==
In the early 1960s research was conducted in Norway on rain penetration of windows and walls, and Øivind Birkeland published a treatise referring to a "rain barrier". In 1963 the Canadian National Research Counsel published a pamphlet titled "Rain Penetration and its Control" using the term "open rain screen".&lt;ref&gt;G.K. Garden, "Rain Penetration and its Control". ''Canadian Building Digest'' (40) 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rainscreen cladding==
Rainscreen cladding is a kind of double-wall construction that utilizes a surface to help keep the rain out, as well as an inner layer to offer thermal insulation, prevent excessive air leakage and carry wind loading. The surface breathes just like a skin as the inner layer reduces energy losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanfibercement.com/information/rainscreen-cladding/|title=Rainscreen Cladding|work=American Fiber Cement Corporation.|date=2015|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The rainscreen system==
For water to enter a wall first the water must get onto the wall and the wall must have openings. Water can then enter the wall by capillary action, gravity, momentum, and air pressure (wind).&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; The rainscreen system provides for two lines of defense against the water intrusion into the walls: The rainscreen and a means to dissipate leakage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aia.org/aiaucmp/groups/ek_members/documents/pdf/aiab098384.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322013717/http://www.aia.org/aiaucmp/groups/ek_members/documents/pdf/aiab098384.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; often referred to as a channel.
In a rainscreen the air gap allows the circulation of air on the [[Housewrap|moisture barrier]]. (These may or may not serve as a [[Vapor barrier|vapour barrier]], which can be installed on the interior or exterior side of the insulation depending on the climate). This helps direct water away from the main exterior wall which in many climates is insulated. Keeping the insulation dry helps prevent problems such as mold formation and water leakage. The vapour-permeable air/weather barrier prevents water molecules from entering the insulated cavity but allows the passage of vapour, thus reducing the trapping of moisture within the main wall assembly.

The air gap (or cavity) can be created in several ways. One method is to use [[furring]] (battens, strapping) fastened vertically to the wall. Ventilation openings are made at the bottom and top of the wall so air can naturally rise through the cavity. Wall penetrations including windows and doors require special care to maintain the ventilation. In the pressure-equalized system the ventilation openings must be large enough to allow air-flow to equalize the pressure on both sides of the cladding. A ratio of 10:1 cladding leakage area to ventilation area has been suggested.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

A water/air resistant membrane is placed between the furring and the sheathing to prevent rain water from entering the wall structure. The membrane directs water away and toward special drip edge [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|flashings]] which protect other parts of the building.

[[Building insulation|Insulation]] may be provided beneath the membrane. The thickness of insulation is determined by building code requirements as well as performance requirements set out by the architect.

The system is a form of double-wall construction that uses an outer layer to keep out the rain and an inner layer to provide thermal insulation, prevent excessive air leakage and carry wind loading. The outer layer breathes like a skin while the inner layer reduces energy losses. The structural frame of the building is kept absolutely dry, as water never reaches it or the thermal insulation. Evaporation and drainage in the cavity removes water that penetrates between panel joints. Water droplets are not driven through the panel joints or openings because the rainscreen principle means that wind pressure acting on the outer face of the panel is equalized in the cavity. Therefore, there is no significant pressure differential to drive the rain through joints. During extreme weather, a minimal amount of water may penetrate the outer cladding. This, however, will run as droplets down the back of the cladding sheets and be dissipated through evaporation and drainage.

==The rainscreen drainage plane==
[[Image:Rainscreen layersbw.png|thumb|Typical layers in a wall system with rainscreen drainage plane]] 
A '''rainscreen drainage plane''' is a separation between the veneer and the weather resistant barrier of a rainscreen. It provides predictable, unobstructed path drainage for liquid moisture to drain from a high point of the wall (where it enters) to a low point of the wall (where it exits) the wall detail. The drainage plane must move the water out of the wall system quickly to prevent absorption and consequential rot, mold, and structural degradation.

A drainage plane 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is designed to shed bulk rainwater and/or condensation downward and outward in a manner that will prevent uncontrolled water penetration into the conditioned spaces of a building or structure. In a barrier wall system, the exterior cladding also serves as the principal drainage plane and primary line of defense against bulk rainwater penetration. In cavity wall construction, however, the principal drainage plane and primary line of defense against bulk rainwater penetration is located inside the wall cavity, generally on the inboard side of the air space (either directly applied to the outboard surface of the exterior sheathing layer or, in the case of insulated cavity walls, on the outboard surface of the rigid or otherwise moisture-impervious insulation layer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Building Envelope Design Guide - Wall Systems|date=January 2007|work=Whole Building Design Guide|accessdate=March 1, 2009|url=http://www.wbdg.org/design/env_wall.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===A predictable pressure equalization plane===
Air pressure difference is one of the dominant forces for driving a rainwater into wall systems.&lt;ref name="ctu"&gt;Pressure Equalization in Rainscreen Wall Systems (July 1998). In Construction Technology Update. Retrieved March 1, 2009 from {{cite web |url=http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/pubs/ctus/17_e.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228220815/http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/pubs/ctus/17_e.html |archivedate=2009-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A rainscreen drainage plane that works as a predictable pressure equalization plane creates a separation (an air chamber) between the backside of a rainscreen and the exterior surface of the weather-resistant barrier that is installed on the exterior sheeting of the structural back up wall. This separation allows air contaminated with water vapor from all points in that wall system to exit the interior of the wall system. Moisture laden air that is allowed to pressurize will attempt to move to a lower pressure area that may be deeper into the interior of a wall detail.

===Technical considerations===
*To prevent '''bridging''' due to [[capillary action]], Building Science Consulting recommends the drainage plane maintain a cavity of &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;" or greater, though smaller cavities with hydrophobic materials can also provide the capillary break.&lt;ref&gt;BSD-013: Rain Control in Buildings (September 2008).

*Ensure that the drainage plane does not compress when installed so that it maintains an acceptable air space.
*Similarly, ensure that the drainage plane isn't plugged by debris which commonly is present in the form of mortar squeezings or excess stucco. Some mechanical drainage planes include measures to prevent clogging.
*Ensure that the drainage plane creates a compartmentalized pressure equalization plane to prevent pressure driven moisture intrusion.&lt;ref name="ctu" /&gt;
*Details at top and bottom terminations of a wall system should accommodate moisture drainage (often termed "'''weeping'''") and air flow to properly dry out the wall.
*ASTM International Standards include  a standard test for drainage plane systems in [[Exterior insulation finishing system|EIFS]] Systems under code '''ASTM E2273'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Test Method for Determining the Drainage Efficiency of Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems (EIFS) Clad Wall Assemblies|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/E2273.htm|website=ASTM International|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the International Code Council features a more general "Evaluation guideline for a moisture drainage system used with exterior wall veneers" under code '''ICC-ES EG356'''.
*Inappropriate rain screen materials may also introduce a risk of fast-spreading external fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire Risks From External Cladding Panels – A Perspective From The UK|url=http://www.probyn-miers.com/perspective/2016/02/fire-risks-from-external-cladding-panels-perspective-from-the-uk/|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entrapped moisture risks===
Once moisture has penetrated deep into a wall system through the weather resistant barrier and into the exterior sheathing, the wall is deep wet. The air flow that exists in most wall systems is a slight draft that will not dry this condition out in a timely manner. The result is a compromised wall system with rot, rust, and mold potential. The structural integrity of the wall is at stake, as is the health of the occupants. The longer the wall remains wet, the greater the risk.  50% percent of homes suffer from mold problems.&lt;ref&gt;Mold Occurrence Influenced By Building Inspection Practice (January 2005) Dr. Richard A. Wolfe. Construction News &amp; Articles. Retrieved March 1, 2009 from http://www.greatpossibilities.com/articles/publish/mold.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Billions of dollars are spent annually on litigation involving mold and rot problems stemming from entrapped moisture; this has created an entire industry centered around construction litigation. Such litigation has caused insurance premiums for contractors to increase significantly and has made it difficult for contractors involved in moisture related lawsuits to obtain insurance at all.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rics.org/NR/rdonlyres/81485882-20E6-4408-A4D0-61FC8D6C1D3A/0/Grosskopf.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Identifying the Causes of Moisture-Related Defect Litigation in U.S.

'''Recon Instruments''' was a Canadian technology company that produced [[smartglasses]] and wearable displays marketed by the company as "heads-up displays" for sports. (However, none of Recon's products contained a transparent display element delivering actual see-through capability and can thus be considered [[heads-up displays]] in the true meaning of the term.) Recon's products delivered live activity metrics, [[GPS]] maps, and notifications directly to the user's eye. Recon's first heads-up display offering was released commercially in October 2010,&lt;ref name="transcendintro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reconinstruments.com/2010/10/worlds-first-gps-goggles-head-mounted-display-available-now/ |title=Recon Instruments deliver world's first GPS goggles with head-mounted display |publisher=Recon Instruments |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; roughly a year and a half before Google introduced [[Google Glass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plus.google.com/+GoogleGlass/posts/aKymsANgWBD |title=We think technology should work for you... |publisher=Google |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recon received investments from companies including [[Motorola Solutions]] and [[Intel]].&lt;ref name="motorolainvestment"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.motorolasolutions.com/news/recon-instruments-secures-investment-from-motorola-solutions.htm |title=Recon Instruments Secures Investment from Motorola Solutions |publisher=Motorola Solutions |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intelinvestment"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2013/09/26/chip-shot-intel-capital-invests-in-wearables-with-recon-instruments |title=Chip Shot: Intel Capital Invests in Wearables with Recon Instruments |publisher=Intel |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also partnered with enterprise software vendors in order to make its latest smart eyewear device, the Jet, suitable for industrial applications.&lt;ref name="sapdeal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recon-instruments-integrating-jet-smart-173000881.html |title=Recon Instruments Integrating Its Jet Smart Eyewear Solution With SAP AR Mobile Apps |publisher=Yahoo Finance |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apxdeal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/16/apx-labs-partnership-idUSnPn2vjTgb+84+PRN20150316 |title=Recon Instruments And APX Labs Announce Partnership |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 17, 2015, Recon was acquired by [[Intel]]&lt;ref name="intelbuyoutintel"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.intel.com/technology/2015/06/intel-acquires-recon/ |title=Intel Acquires Recon; Eyes Future of Wearables |publisher=Intel |accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intelbuyoutrecon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reconinstruments.com/2015/06/intel-acquires-recon-instruments/ |title=Intel Acquires Recon Instruments |publisher=Recon Instruments |accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Recon then described itself as "an Intel company."&lt;ref name="reconaboutus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reconinstruments.com/company/about-us/ |title=About us |publisher=Recon Instruments |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Intel announced that all remaining Recon Instruments products were going to be discontinued by the end of the year &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-rivals-galileo-joule-edison-axed-by-intel-plus-recon-jet-smart-glasses/|title=Raspberry Pi rivals Galileo, Joule, Edison axed by Intel, plus Recon Jet smart glasses {{!}} ZDNet|last=Tung|first=Liam|work=ZDNet|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to a Bloomberg report in October 2017, Intel had in fact completely closed its Recon Instruments division already in early summer 2017&lt;ref name="bloombergclosingreport"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-06/intel-is-said-to-shutter-its-augmented-reality-goggles-brand|title=Intel Shutters Its Augmented-Reality Goggles Brand|last=Webb|first=Alex|work=Bloomberg|access-date=2017-10-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
The technology behind Recon Instruments' products was born in September 2006 from an integrated [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] project. That project was undertaken by co-founders Dan Eisenhardt, Hamid Abdollahi, Fraser Hall, and Darcy Hughes at the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Sauder School of Business|Robert H. Lee Sauder School of Business]].

Recon Instruments incorporated in January 2008, operating from small office and lab spaces rented from the University of British Columbia. In April 2010, the company moved to its current headquarters in the [[Yaletown]] area of [[downtown Vancouver]].&lt;ref name="ftstory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/879d221e-d86c-11e0-8f0a-00144feabdc0.html |title=All eyes on a niche business
 |publisher=Financial Times |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2015, Recon is still led by co-founders Dan Eisenhardt and Hamid Abdollahi.&lt;ref name="reconaboutus" /&gt;

=== Discovery and prototyping ===
Recon's co-founders originally looked into developing a HUD product for [[Swimming (sport)|swimmers]]. Eisenhardt, a competitive swimmer himself, believed a HUD would be a valuable replacement for the clock at the side of the pool. Eisenhardt and his fellow founders developed the idea while studying at the University of British Columbia. However, a patent already existed for swimming goggles with a heads-up display. Because of that patent and the challenges presented by the technology's small form factor and intended operating conditions, the team eventually chose to focus on a [[winter sport]]s product.&lt;ref name="ftstory" /&gt; The co-founders subsequently turned this school project into their first retail product, which was distributed globally in October 2010.&lt;ref name="transcendintro" /&gt;

=== Investors ===
Recon has received investments from both venture-capital firms and other technology companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/recon-instruments |title=Recon Instruments |publisher=CrunchBase |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Recon received $10 million in [[Series A round|Series A funding]] from Vanedge Capital and [[Kopin Corporation]]. Vanedge Capital is a Canadian venture capital firm that specializes in "interactive entertainment and digital media businesses." Kopin Corporation is a U.S. firm known for microdisplays aimed at mobile electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reconinstruments.com/2012/01/recon-instruments-raises-10-million-series-a-financing/ |title=Recon Instruments raise $10 million Series A financing |publisher=Recon Instruments |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, [[Intel Capital]], the venture capital arm of [[Intel]], announced that it had invested in Recon. Details of the deal were not disclosed. However, the announcement described wearables as "an area of significant focus" for Intel Capital, and it said the investment would allow Recon to "accelerate product development, marketing and global sales, as well as gain access to Intel Capital's expertise in manufacturing, operations and technology."&lt;ref name="intelinvestment" /&gt;

In April 2014, [[Motorola Solutions]] announced an investment in Recon. Motorola Solutions describes itself as a provider of communications equipment for "government and enterprise customers." The terms of the deal were not made public. In July 2014, Motorola Solutions demonstrated a Recon product as a piece of kit for [[Police officer|law enforcement personnel]].&lt;ref name="motorolainvestment" /&gt;

=== Intel acquisition ===

On June 17, 2015, Recon was acquired by [[Intel]].&lt;ref name="intelbuyoutintel" /&gt; The value of the deal was initially reported to be as high as [[C$]]175M&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techvibes.com/2015/06/17/recon-instruments-acquired-by-intel-2015-06-17|title=Vancouver's Recon Instruments Acquired by Intel for $175 Million|website=Techvibes|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, this sum was not confirmed by Recon Instrument's Dan Eisenhardt&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/innovation/recon-instruments-intel-dan-eisenhardt-interview/|title=Recon Instruments CEO Dan Eisenhardt on selling to Intel|date=2015-06-23|work=Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and was later generally considered inaccurate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/17/intel-acquires-successful-google-glass-competitor-recon-instruments/|title=Intel acquires successful Google Glass competitor Recon Instruments|date=2015-06-17|website=VentureBeat|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.biv.com/article/2015/6/vancouvers-recon-instruments-sold-intel/|title=Vancouver’s Recon Instruments sold to Intel|work=Business In Vancouver|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloombergclosingreport"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. After the acquisition, Recon stayed in Vancouver and planned to make use of Intel's technological resources in order to "develop smart device platforms for a broader set of customers and market segments."&lt;ref name="intelbuyoutrecon" /&gt;

=== Closing of Recon Instruments in 2017 ===
In June 2017, it became known that Intel intended to discontinue all remaining Recon Instruments products, i.e., Recon Jet and Recon Jet Pro.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Around the same time, Recon Instruments ceased all activities on both social media and its own website.
According to a Bloomberg report in October 2017, Intel had in fact completely closed its Recon Instruments division already in early summer 2017&lt;ref name="bloombergclosingreport"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Hardware ==

Recon's first products were smart goggles and what the company marketed (incorrectly) as "[[heads-up displays]]" aimed at the winter sports market. More recently, the company broadened its focus with the Jet, a [[Smartglasses|smart eyewear]] device designed for activities like [[cycling]] and [[running]].

=== Technology Overview ===
All of Recon Instrument's products were essentially head-worn, self contained mobile devices equipped with [[GPS]] and environmental sensors. A near-eye display was provided in the form of a single non-translucent (solid) micro display situated below and to the side of one eye. This required the wearer to glance down and to the side in order to read the screen contents. Recon's head-worn displays were therefore [[Peripheral Head-Mounted Display (PHMD)|Peripheral Head-Mounted Displays]] rather than [[Head-up display|Head-up displays]] in the common meaning of the term; much less were they able to deliver an [[Augmented Reality]] experience due to their lack of see-through capabilities.

=== Transcend ===
Recon's first commercial product, the Transcend, was released in October 2010. It was designed for [[winter sport]]s and featured a small [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD screen]] embedded into a [[Goggles|snow goggle]] frame by eyewear maker Zeal Optics, which is now a subsidiary of [[Maui Jim]], Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=105774385 |title=Company Overview of Zeal Optics, Inc. |publisher=Bloomberg Business |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Transcend displayed data like [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] maps, temperature, speed, and altitude, and it allowed users to share that data.&lt;ref name="transcendintro" /&gt; In 2011, the Transcend earned the [[Consumer Electronics Show]]'s Best of Innovations award for Personal Electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/107089-ces-2011-best-of-innovations |title=CES 2011: Best of Innovations award winners announced |publisher=Pocket Lint |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MOD and MOD Live ===
Recon's MOD and MOD Live heads-up displays were released in November 2011. Unlike the Transcend, the MOD and MOD Live were sold separately from snow goggles. Users could fit them into specially designed "Recon-Ready" goggles from eyewear makers including Uvex, Alpina, and Briko.&lt;ref name="modlivepr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reconinstruments.com/2011/11/recon-instruments-next-generation-technology-available-this-fall/ |title=Next generation HUD technology available from Recon Instruments this fall |publisher=Recon Instruments |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oakley also integrated the MOD Live into a specially designed snow goggle frame and marketed the resulting product as the Airwave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/10/27/oakley-unveils-airwave-ski-goggles-equipped-with-recons-mod-liv/ |title=Oakley unveils Airwave ski goggles equipped with Recon's MOD Live heads-up display, iOS app |publisher=Engadget |accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the MOD and MOD Live offered functionality similar to the Transcend's, but the MOD Live introduced the ability to connect to [[smartphone]]s via [[Bluetooth]]. When connected to a user's smartphone, the MOD Live could display [[caller ID]] and [[Short Message Service|SMS]] notifications.&lt;ref name="modlivepr" /&gt;

=== Snow2 ===
Introduced in November 2013, the Snow2 is Recon's latest standalone heads-up display. It features a faster [[Microprocessor|processor]] than the MOD and MOD Live along with improved display brightness and contrast, longer battery life, 802.11a/b/g/n [[Wi-Fi]] connectivity, and [[MFi Program|Made for iPhone (MFi)]] certification.

Like the MOD Live, the Snow2 can connect to smartphones in order to display call and SMS notifications. It also lets users connect to [[Facebook]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reconinstruments.com/2013/12/recon-heads-up-display-facebook-integration/ |title=Recon Instruments introduce social integration feature for Snow2 |publisher=Recon Instruments |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and track their friends using the GPS-enabled maps feature.

=== Jet ===
Unlike the Snow2, the Jet combines a heads-up display with a Recon-designed sunglass frame and polarized lenses.

The Jet is aimed at activities like [[cycling]] and [[running]] rather than winter sports. Recon has also partnered with [[enterprise software]] firms [[SAP SE|SAP]]&lt;ref name="sapdeal" /&gt; and APX Labs&lt;ref name="apxdeal" /&gt; with the aim of making Jet suitable for industrial applications in fields like [[manufacturing]] and [[Fossil fuel|oil-and-gas extraction]]. [[Motorola Solutions]], one of Recon's investors, has also demonstrated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reconinstruments.com/2014/07/recon-showcase-jet-for-police-use-case-at-apco-2014/ |title=Recon Instruments showcase Recon Jet eyewear at APCO trade show |publisher=Recon Instruments |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Jet as [[Law enforcement|law-enforcement]] equipment, as well.

Built into the Jet are GPS connectivity as well as sensors to track metrics like speed, pace, distance, and elevation gain. Users can also connect third-party sensors via [[ANT+]] and smartphones via [[Bluetooth]]. Like the MOD Live and Snow2, the Jet can display call and SMS notifications from user's smartphones.

The Jet is powered by a 1&amp;nbsp;GHz processor with dual [[ARM Cortex-A9]] cores. Its processor, display, and camera sit on the right side of the frame, while the [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] sits on the left, evening out weight distribution. The battery is designed to be interchangeable, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reconinstruments.com/products/jet/ |title=Recon Jet - Smart Eyewear |publisher=Recon Instruments |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software ==

=== ReconOS ===
Recon devices run ReconOS, an [[operating system]] based on [[Android (operating system)|Android]].&lt;ref name="androidbased"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reconinstruments.com/developers/resources/downloads/ |title=Getting Started |publisher=Recon Instruments |accessdate=March 30, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415050939/http://www.reconinstruments.com/developers/resources/downloads/ |archivedate=April 15, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ReconOS has a custom [[Graphical user interface|user interface]] designed for small displays. It shows live activity metrics and lets users share those metrics to social media. ReconOS also features GPS maps that display the locations of nearby friends and rotate depending on the user's head orientation. When a Recon device is paired with a smartphone, ReconOS can display call and SMS notifications, and it allows users to control the phone's music playback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reconinstruments.com/products/snow2/os4/ |title=Introducing ReconOS 4 for Snow2 |publisher=Recon Instruments |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''risk management information system''' (RMIS) is an [[information system]] that assists in consolidating property values, claims, policy, and exposure information and providing the tracking and management reporting capabilities to enable the user to monitor and control the overall cost of [[risk management]].

==Overview==

The management of risk data and information is key to the success of any risk management effort regardless of an organization's size or industry sector.  Risk management information systems/services (RMIS) are used to support expert advice and cost-effective information management solutions around key processes such as:
* Risk identification and assessment
* Risk control
* Risk financing

Typically, RMIS facilitates the consolidation of information related to insurance, such as claims from multiple sources, property values, policy information, and exposure information, into one system.   Often, RMIS applies primarily to “casualty” claims/loss data systems.  Such casualty coverages include auto liability, auto physical damage, workers' compensation, general liability and products liability.

RMIS products are designed to provide their insured organizations and their brokers with basic policy and claim information via electronic access, and most recently, via the Internet. This information is essential for managing individual claims, identifying trends, marketing an insurance program, loss forecasting, actuarial studies and internal loss data communication within a client organization. They may also provide the tracking and management reporting capabilities to enable one to monitor and control overall cost of risk in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

In the context of the acronym RMIS, the word “risk” pertains to an insured or self-insured organization. This is important because prior to the advent of RMIS, insurance company loss information reporting typically organized loss data around insurance policy numbers. The historical focus on insurance policies detracted from a clear, coherent and consolidated picture of a single customer's loss experience. The advent of the first PC and UNIX based standalone RMIS was in 1982, by Mark Dorn, under the trade name RISKMASTER. This began a breakthrough step in the insurance industry's evolution toward persistent and focused understanding of their end-customer needs.   Typically, the best solution for an organization depends on whether it is enhancing an existing RMIS system, ensuring the highest level of data quality, or designing and implementing a new system while maintaining a focus on state-of-the-art technology.

==Common types of RMIS==

Most major insurance companies (carriers), broker/agents, and third party administrators (TPAs)offer/provide at least one external RMIS product to their insureds (clients) and any brokers involved in the insurance program.  Most commonly, RMIS products allow individual claim detail look-up, basic trend report production, policy summaries and ad hoc queries. The resulting information can then be shared throughout the client's organization, usually for insurance program cost allocation, loss prevention and effective claim management at the local level. More advanced products allow multiple claim data sources to be consolidated into one “Master RMIS,” which is essential for most large client organizations with complex insurance programs.

The primary users of RMIS are risk/insurance departments of insured organizations and any insurance broker involved. It is much less common for the insured's safety department and vehicle operations department to have access to RMIS despite similar interest in the data. In fact, safety and vehicle operations of larger organizations typically maintain their own separate database systems of “accidents/incidents,” many of which will correlate to RMIS claim data.

Insurance companies normally use a different version of externally provided RMIS for internal use, such as by underwriting and loss control personnel. Occasionally, there could be timing or other differences that could cause data discrepancies between the internal system and externally provided RMIS.

Insurance brokers have a similar need for access to their insured client's claim data. Brokers are normally added as an additional user to the RMIS product provided to their clients by the insurance carrier and TPAs. The information available from RMIS is critical to the broker for interfacing effectively with their counterparts in the insurance carrier and TPAs. Additionally, effectively presented RMIS information that shows trends and analysis is essential to successfully marketing their clients' insurance programs.

Insurance carrier and a TPA claim adjusters traditionally use claims management systems to collect and manage claim information and to administer claims. Some client organizations, however, may choose to manage certain types of claims or those within a loss retention layer and thus use this type of system as well.

Typically, the claims management system provides the primary data to RMIS products. RMIS products in turn provide an externally accessed view into the client's claims data. RMIS products are commonly available directly from larger insurance carriers and TPAs, but the most advanced systems are often offered by independent RMIS vendors. Independent RMIS vendor systems are most desirable when a client organization needs to consolidate claims data from multiple current insurance programs and/or past programs with current program information.

==Key vendor attributes and differences ==

Along with insurance carriers, broker/agents and TPAs that offer their own proprietary systems, there are a variety of direct RMIS technology companies who sell to direct insureds and even the carriers, broker/agents and TPAs themselves.

Major differences among RMIS vendors include:
*Currency of technology (Internet-based vs. Internet-accessible);
*System speed (response time for screen changes, report generation time, etc.);
*Flexibility in meeting client requirements (custom screen views, client-defined data fields, special reports, etc.);
*Ongoing support service quality (availability of senior/quality technical support, help desk availability, dedicated staff and stability, etc.);
*Data quality control (data conversion accuracy, data source cleanup, etc.);
*Pricing (first-year cost, ongoing cost, custom programming charges, data record storage fees);
*Availability of related modules (property exposure management, policy management, claim/incident setup, occupational safety and health administration (OSHA) record keeping, claims audits, etc.);
*Turnaround time for data loads;
*Foreign conversion/support (financial fields, language, fluent support staff, etc.)

RMIS system compatibility varies among carriers, broker/agents and TPAs. However, quality independent RMIS vendors by design can take almost any claim data source and convert or map the data to their particular system's file structure. A few major insurance carriers offer similar consolidation services, i.e., combining the insured client's current claim data with another carrier's or TPA's data for the same insured client. The other data sources can be for current separate insurance programs or from expired insurance programs. Usually, this type of consolidation service is performed to accommodate their major policyholder organizations. Major TPAs, however, more commonly offer such data consolidation services.

==Average costs and market drivers==

The cost of a typical independent RMIS product varies from $60,000 to $150,000 for the first year, and ongoing annual charges are slightly less. Insurance company RMIS product lines typically average around $50,000 for the first user, but they often offer less expensive light-weight versions for claim look-up only. More costly full-featured products are sometimes available with more advanced reporting systems. The products are usually priced on a per-user basis on a sliding scale for a larger number of users. Insured clients' brokers are given access at no cost or occasionally for a flat annual fee for multiple insured clients with a particular broker.

TPAs commonly include one or two RMIS access IDs within their claims management pricing to encourage both the client's broker and the client to use their claim look-up product. Normally, beyond the first two access IDs, the pricing follows the same per-user range of the insurance companies.  The cost drivers of RMIS include:
*  Number of user/access IDs
*  Number of outside claim data sources that must be converted (carriers and TPAs do not have to convert their own data)
*  Frequency of outside claim data updates
*  Special programming/report development charges
*  Training of users (initial and annual users' conferences)

Higher cost systems do not always correlate to better performance in terms of both usefulness and speed. While most carrier and TPA RMIS systems are similarly priced, the independent RMIS vendors' price range varies significantly, as previously mentioned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4792">{{redirect| hopping code || frequency-hopping spread spectrum }}

A '''rolling code''' (or sometimes called a '''hopping code''') is used in [[keyless entry]] systems to prevent [[replay attack]]s, where an [[Eavesdropping|eavesdropper]] records the transmission and replays it at a later time to cause the receiver to 'unlock'. Such systems are typical in [[garage door opener]]s and keyless car entry systems.

== Techniques ==

* Common PRNG ([[pseudorandom number generator]]) &amp;mdash; preferably [[Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator|cryptographically secure]] &amp;mdash; in both transmitter and receiver
* Transmitter sends 'next' code in sequence
* Receiver compares 'next' to its calculated 'next' code.
* A typical implementation compares within the next 256 codes in case receiver missed some transmitted keypresses.

== Application in RF remote control ==

A rolling code transmitter is useful in a security system for providing secure encrypted [[radio frequency]] (RF) transmission comprising an interleaved trinary bit fixed code and rolling code. A receiver demodulates the encrypted RF transmission and recovers the fixed code and rolling code. Upon comparison of the fixed and rolling codes with stored codes and determining that the signal has emanated from an authorized transmitter, a signal is generated to actuate an electric motor to open or close a movable component.

== Rolling code vs. fixed code RF remote control ==

Remote controls send signals in code. When the sending code is the same as the code that is expected by the receiver, then the receiver will actuate the relay, unlock the door, or open the barrier. Remote controls with a fixed code always send the same fixed code. Remote controls with a rolling code (or hopping code) always send out a different code from the one previously sent.

== KeeLoq ==
[[File:Rolling-code-rf-remote-control-2.png|thumb|upright|HCS301 chip from an [[Audi A6]] keyless entry remote, which uses a rolling code system]]
{{main|KeeLoq}}

The Microchip HCS301 was once the most widely used system on garage and gate remote control and receivers. The chip uses the KeeLoq algorithm. The HCS301 KeeLoq system transmits 66 data bits.
* 34 bits are not encrypted : a 28-bit serial number, 4 bits of button information, and 2 status bits (repeat and low battery indicators).
* 32 bits are encrypted (the rolling code) : 4 bits of button information, 2 bits of OVR (used to extend counter value), 10 bits of DISC (discrimination value; often the low 10 bits of the serial number), and a 16-bit counter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Microchip |title=HC301 KeeLoq Code Hopping Encoder |year=2001 |id=DS21143B |publisher=Microchip Technology Inc. |location= |url=http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/21143b.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a resyncing situation, the encrypted 32 bits are replaced with a 32-bit seed value.

== Rolljam vulnerability ==
A rolling code transmitted by radio signal that can be intercepted can be vulnerable to falsification.  In 2015, it was reported that [[Samy Kamkar]] had built an inexpensive electronic device about the size of a wallet that could be concealed on or near a locked vehicle to capture a single keyless entry code to be used at a later time to unlock the vehicle.  The device transmits a jamming signal to block the vehicle's reception of rolling code signals from the owner's fob, while recording these signals from both of his two attempts needed to unlock the vehicle.  The recorded first code is forwarded to the vehicle only when the owner makes the second attempt, while the recorded second code is retained for future use.  Kamkar stated that this vulnerability had been widely known for years to be present in many vehicle types, but was previously undemonstrated.&lt;ref name="RollinCode"&gt;{{cite news | title=A hacker made a $30 gadget that can unlock many cars that have keyless entry | url=http://www.techinsider.io/samy-kamkar-keyless-entry-car-hack-2015-8 | work=[[Tech Insider]] | first=Cadie | last=Thompson | date=2015-08-06 | accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A demonstration was done during [[DEF CON]] 23.&lt;ref name="DC23"&gt;{{cite web | title=Drive It Like You Hacked It: New Attacks and Tools to Wirelessly Steal Cars | url=https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-23/dc-23-speakers.html#Kamkar | work=[[DEF CON]] 23 | first=Samy | last=Kamkar | date=2015-08-07 | accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Satchel and laptop.jpg|right|thumbnail|alt=Light-brown leather bag next to man typing on laptop|Leather satchel]]

A '''satchel''' is a bag, often with a [[strap]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/satchel Satchel], merriam-webster.com, Accessed 28 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The strap is often worn so that it diagonally crosses the body, with the bag hanging on the opposite hip, rather than hanging directly down from the shoulder. They are traditionally used for carrying  [[books]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/satchel Satchel], thefreedictionary.com, Accessed 28 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The back of a satchel extends to form a flap that folds over to cover the top and fastens in the front.  Unlike a [[briefcase]], a satchel is soft-sided.

== School bag ==
[[Image:schulranzen-aus-leder-und-felltornister.jpg|right|thumbnail|Children carrying leather and cowhide satchels]]
The satchel has been a typical accessory of English students for centuries, as attested in Shakespeare's famous monologue, "[[All the world's a stage]]." The traditional Oxford and Cambridge style satchel features a simple pouch with a front flap. Variations include designs with a single or double pocket on the front and sometimes a handle on the top of the bag.  The classic school bag satchel often had two straps, so that it could be worn like a backpack, with the design having the straps coming in a V from the centre of the back of the bag, rather than separate straps on each side.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  This style is sometimes called a satchel backpack.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The use of school bag satchels is common in the United Kingdom, Australia, Western Europe and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hellobolsa.com/7-ways-make-childs-school-bag-lighter/ |title=7 Ways to Make Your Child’s School Bag Lighter |accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Japan the term for a school bag satchel is ''[[randoseru]]''.  The Unicode for the school satchel [[Emoji]] is U+1F392.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emojibase.com/emoji/1f392/schoolsatchel |title=School Satchel Emoji |accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fashion ==

Much of the popularity of the satchel as a fashion accessory in the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Canada since 2008 is driven by the [[Cambridge Satchel Company]], whose product was on a Guardian gift guide in 2009, and was described as a cross-body bag in a 2010 article.&lt;ref name="Guardian gift guide 27 November 2009"&gt;{{cite news | title = Christmas gift guide 2009: Men's accessories | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 27 November 2009 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2009/nov/27/christmas-gift-guide-mens-accessories#/?picture=356107657&amp;index=1 | accessdate = 10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian cross-body 24 April 2010"&gt; {{cite news | last = Cartner-Morley | first = Jess | title = How to dress: Cross-body bags | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 24 April 2010 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/24/jess-cartner-morley-cross-body-bags | accessdate = 17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fashion 23 Dec 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lukas | first = Erin | title = The story behind the explosion of the Cambridge Satchels | journal = Fashion Magazine | date = 23 December 2011 | url = http://www.fashionmagazine.com/fashion/2011/12/23/the-story-behind-those-cambridge-satchels/ | accessdate = 17 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent 23 Jan 2014"&gt;{{cite news | last = Williams-Grut | first = Oscar | title = Moneybags: humble British satchel conquers the world  | newspaper = The Independent | date = 23 January 2014 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/moneybags-humble-british-satchel-conquers-the-world-9082052.html | accessdate = 17 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Any system that uses satellite radio signals to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning}}

A '''satellite navigation''' or '''satnav''' system is a system that uses [[satellite]]s to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning. It allows small [[electronics|electronic]] receivers to determine their location ([[longitude]], [[latitude]], and [[altitude]]/[[elevation]]) to high precision (within a few metres) using [[time signal]]s transmitted along a [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] by [[radio]] from satellites. The system can be used for providing position, navigation or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver (satellite tracking). The signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the current local time to high precision, which allows time synchronisation. Satnav systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information generated.

A satellite navigation system with global coverage may be termed a '''global navigation satellite system''' ('''GNSS'''). {{As of|2018|10}}, the [[United States]]' [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) and [[Russia]]'s [[GLONASS]] are fully operational GNSSs, with [[China]]'s [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System]] (BDS) and the [[European Union]]'s [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] scheduled to be fully operational by 2020.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.chinamil.com.cn/news-channels/china-military-news/2010-05/20/content_4222569.htm |title=Beidou satellite navigation system to cover whole world in 2020 |publisher=Eng.chinamil.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-4366_en.htm |title=Galileo goes live! |publisher=europa.eu |date=2016-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]], [[France]] and [[Japan]] are in the process of developing regional navigation and augmentation systems as well.

Global coverage for each system is generally achieved by a [[satellite constellation]] of 18–30 [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO) satellites spread between several [[orbital planes]]. The actual systems vary, but use [[orbital inclination]]s of &gt;50° and [[orbital period]]s of roughly twelve hours (at an altitude of about {{convert|20000|km|mi|disp=or}}).

==Classification==
Satellite navigation systems that provide enhanced accuracy and integrity monitoring usable for civil navigation are classified as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifatca.org/system/files/public_docs/gnss.pdf |publisher=IFATCA |title=A Beginner's Guide to GNSS in Europe |format=PDF |accessdate=20 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''GNSS-1'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} is the first generation system and is the combination of existing satellite navigation systems (GPS and GLONASS), with [[Satellite Based Augmentation System]]s (SBAS) or [[Ground Based Augmentation System]]s (GBAS). In the United States, the satellite based component is the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS), in Europe it is the [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS), and in Japan it is the [[Multi-Functional Transport Satellite|Multi-Functional Satellite Augmentation System]] (MSAS). Ground based augmentation is provided by systems like the [[Local Area Augmentation System]] (LAAS).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
* '''GNSS-2'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} is the second generation of systems that independently provides a full civilian satellite navigation system, exemplified by the European Galileo positioning system. These systems will provide the accuracy and integrity monitoring necessary for civil navigation; including aircraft. Initially, this system consisted of only Upper L-Band frequency sets (L1 for GPS, E1 for Galileo, G1 for GLONASS). In recent years, GNSS systems have begun activating Lower L-Band frequency sets (L2 and L5 for GPS, E5a and E5b for Galileo, G3 for GLONASS) for civilian use; they feature higher aggregate accuracy and less problems with signal reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gssc.esa.int/navipedia/index.php/Galileo_General_Introduction|title=Galileo General Introduction - Navipedia|website=gssc.esa.int|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gssc.esa.int/navipedia/index.php/GNSS_signal|title=GNSS signal - Navipedia|website=gssc.esa.int|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 2018, a few consumer grade GNSS devices are being sold that leverage both, and are typically called "Dual band GNSS" or "Dual band GPS" devices.
* Core Satellite navigation systems, currently GPS (United States), GLONASS (Russian Federation), Galileo (European Union) and Compass (China).
* Global Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) such as Omnistar and [[StarFire (navigation system)|StarFire]].
* Regional SBAS including WAAS (US), EGNOS (EU), MSAS (Japan) and [[GPS-aided geo-augmented navigation|GAGAN]] (India).
* Regional Satellite Navigation Systems such as China's [[Beidou navigation system|Beidou]], India's [[Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System|NAVIC]], and Japan's proposed [[QZSS]].
* Continental scale Ground Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS) for example the Australian GRAS and the joint US Coast Guard, Canadian Coast Guard, US Army Corps of Engineers and US Department of Transportation National [[Differential GPS]] (DGPS) service.
* Regional scale GBAS such as CORS networks.
* Local GBAS typified by a single GPS reference station operating [[Real Time Kinematic]] (RTK) corrections.

== History and theory ==
[[File:Accuracy of Navigation Systems.svg|thumb]]
Ground based [[radio navigation]] has long been practiced.  The [[Decca Navigator System|DECCA]], [[LORAN]], [[Gee (navigation)|GEE]] and [[Omega Navigation System|Omega]] systems used terrestrial [[longwave]] radio [[transmitter]]s which broadcast a radio pulse from a known "master" location, followed by a pulse repeated from a number of "slave" stations.  The delay between the reception of the master signal and the slave signals allowed the receiver to deduce the distance to each of the slaves, providing a [[fix (position)|fix]].

The first satellite navigation system was [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]], a system deployed by the US military in the 1960s. Transit's operation was based on the [[Doppler effect]]: the satellites travelled on well-known paths and broadcast their signals on a well-known [[radio frequency]].  The received frequency will differ slightly from the broadcast frequency because of the movement of the satellite with respect to the receiver. By monitoring this frequency shift over a short time interval, the receiver can determine its location to one side or the other of the satellite, and several such measurements combined with a precise knowledge of the satellite's orbit can fix a particular position. Satellite orbital position errors are induced by variations in the gravity field and radar refraction, among others. These were resolved by a team led by Harold L Jury of Pan Am Aerospace Division in Florida from 1970-1973. Using real-time data assimilation and recursive estimation, the systematic and residual errors were narrowed down to a manageable level to permit accurate navigation. &lt;ref&gt;Jury, H, 1973, Application of the Kalman Filter to Real-time Navigation using Synchronous Satellites, Proceedings of the 10th International Symposium on Space Technology and Science, Tokyo, 945-952. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Part of an orbiting satellite's broadcast included its precise orbital data. In order to ensure accuracy, the [[US Naval Observatory|US Naval Observatory (USNO)]] continuously observed the precise orbits of these satellites. As a satellite's orbit deviated, the USNO would send the updated information to the satellite. Subsequent broadcasts from an updated satellite would contain its most recent [[ephemeris]].

Modern systems are more direct.  The satellite broadcasts a signal that contains orbital data (from which the position of the satellite can be calculated) and the precise time the signal was transmitted.  The orbital [[ephemeris]] is transmitted in a data message that is superimposed on a code that serves as a timing reference. The satellite uses an [[atomic clock]] to maintain synchronization of all the satellites in the constellation. The receiver compares the time of broadcast encoded in the transmission of three (at sea level) or four different satellites, thereby measuring the time-of-flight to each satellite. Several such measurements can be made at the same time to different satellites, allowing a continual fix to be generated in real time using an adapted version of [[trilateration]]: see [[GNSS positioning calculation]] for details.

Each distance measurement, regardless of the system being used, places the receiver on a spherical shell at the measured distance from the broadcaster. By taking several such measurements and then looking for a point where they meet, a fix is generated. However, in the case of fast-moving receivers, the position of the signal moves as signals are received from several satellites. In addition, the radio signals slow slightly as they pass through the ionosphere, and this slowing varies with the receiver's angle to the satellite, because that changes the distance through the ionosphere. The basic computation thus attempts to find the shortest directed line tangent to four oblate spherical shells centred on four satellites. Satellite navigation receivers reduce errors by using combinations of signals from multiple satellites and multiple correlators, and then using techniques such as [[Kalman filter]]ing to combine the noisy, partial, and constantly changing data into a single estimate for position, time, and velocity.

[[File:Satellite-navigation.jpg|thumb|Satellite navigation using a [[laptop]] and a [[GPS]] receiver]]
The original motivation for satellite navigation was for military applications. Satellite navigation allows precision in the delivery of weapons to targets, greatly increasing their lethality whilst reducing inadvertent casualties from mis-directed weapons. (See [[Guided bomb]]). Satellite navigation also allows forces to be directed and to locate themselves more easily, reducing the [[fog of war]].

The ability to supply satellite navigation signals is also the ability to deny their availability. The operator of a satellite navigation system potentially has the ability to degrade or eliminate satellite navigation services over any territory it desires.

===GPS===
{{Main article|Global Positioning System}}

The United States' Global Positioning System (GPS) consists of up to 32 [[medium Earth orbit]] satellites in six different [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]s, with the exact number of satellites varying as older satellites are retired and replaced. Operational since 1978 and globally available since 1994, GPS is the world's most utilized satellite navigation system.

===GLONASS===
{{Main article|GLONASS}}
The formerly [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], and now [[Russia]]n, '''''Glo'''bal'naya '''Na'''vigatsionnaya '''S'''putnikovaya '''S'''istema'', (GLObal NAvigation Satellite System or GLONASS), is a space-based satellite navigation system that provides a civilian radionavigation-satellite service and is also used by the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces. GLONASS has full global coverage with 24 satellites.

===Galileo===
{{Main article|Galileo (satellite navigation)}}
The [[European Union]] and [[European Space Agency]] agreed in March 2002 to introduce their own alternative to GPS, called the [[Galileo positioning system]]. Galileo became operational on 15 December 2016 (global Early Operational Capability (EOC)) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=europa.eu |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-4366_en.htm |title=Galileo goes live!|date=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At an estimated cost of €3 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5286200.stm |title=Boost to Galileo sat-nav system |date=25 August 2006 |accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the system of 30 [[Medium Earth orbit|MEO]] satellites was originally scheduled to be operational in 2010.

==Augmentation==
[[GNSS augmentation]] is a method of improving a navigation system's attributes, such as accuracy, reliability, and availability, through the integration of external information into the calculation process, for example, the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]], the [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]], the [[Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System]], [[Differential GPS]], [[GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation]] (GAGAN) and [[inertial navigation system]]s.

===DORIS===
{{Main article|DORIS (geodesy)}}
Doppler Orbitography and Radio-positioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) is a [[France|French]] precision navigation system. Unlike other GNSS systems, it is based on static emitting stations around the world, the receivers being on satellites, in order to precisely determine their orbital position. The system may be used also for mobile receivers on land with more limited usage and coverage. Used with traditional GNSS systems, it pushes the accuracy of positions to centimetric precision (and to millimetric precision for altimetric application and also allows monitoring very tiny seasonal changes of Earth rotation and deformations), in order to build a much more precise geodesic reference system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/doris.html |title=DORIS information page |publisher=Jason.oceanobs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low Earth orbit satellite phone networks==
The two current operational low Earth orbit [[satellite phone]] networks are able to track transceiver units with accuracy of a few kilometers using doppler shift calculations from the satellite. The coordinates are sent back to the transceiver unit where they can be read using [[AT command]]s or a [[graphical user interface]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://common.globalstar.com/doc/common/en/products/gsp1700_usermanual.pdf |title=Globalstar GSP-1700 manual |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyhelp.net/acrobat/jan_05/Iridium%20SBD-FAQ%201-05.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109014357/http://www.skyhelp.net/acrobat/jan_05/Iridium%20SBD-FAQ%201-05.pdf |date=November 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be used by the gateway to enforce restrictions on geographically bound calling plans.

The '''separation principle''' is one of the fundamental principles of [[stochastic control theory]], which states that the problems of optimal control and state estimation can be decoupled under certain conditions. In its most basic formulation it deals with a linear stochastic system
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   dx &amp;  =A(t)x(t)\,dt+B_1(t)u(t)\,dt+B_2(t)\,dw \\
   dy &amp;  =C(t)x(t)\,dt +D(t)\,dw
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
with a state process &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, an output process &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and a control &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is a vector-valued [[Wiener process]], &lt;math&gt;x(0)&lt;/math&gt; is a zero-mean [[Gaussian]] random vector independent of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; are matrix-valued functions which generally are taken to be continuous of bounded variation. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;DD'&lt;/math&gt; is  nonsingular on some interval &lt;math&gt;[0,T]&lt;/math&gt;. The problem is to design an output feedback law &lt;math&gt;\pi:\,  y \mapsto u&lt;/math&gt; which maps the observed process &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; to the control input &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; in a nonanticipatory manner so as to minimize the functional
:&lt;math&gt;
J(u) = \mathbb{E}\left\{ \int_0^T x(t)'Q(t)x(t)\,dt+\int_0^Tu(t)'R(t)u(t)\,dt +x(T)'Sx(T)\right\},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}&lt;/math&gt; denotes expected value, prime (&lt;math&gt;'&lt;/math&gt;) denotes transpose. and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are continuous matrix functions of bounded variation, &lt;math&gt; Q(t)&lt;/math&gt; is positive semi-definite and &lt;math&gt;R(t)&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Under suitable conditions, which need to be properly stated,  &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; can be chosen in the form
:&lt;math&gt;
u(t)=K(t)\hat x(t),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hat x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the linear least-squares estimate of the state vector &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; obtained from the [[Kalman filter]]
:&lt;math&gt;
d\hat x=A(t)\hat x(t)\,dt+B_1(t)u(t)\,dt +L(t)(dy-C(t)\hat x(t)\,dt),\quad \hat x(0)=0,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the gain of the optimal [[linear-quadratic regulator]] obtained by taking &lt;math&gt;B_2=D=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x(0)&lt;/math&gt; deterministic, and where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the  [[Kalman filter|Kalman gain]]. There is also a non-Gaussian version of this problem (to be discussed below) where the Wiener process  &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by a more general square-integrable martingale with possible jumps.&lt;ref name="GL2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tryphon T. Georgiou and Anders Lindquist |title=The Separation Principle in Stochastic Control, Redux |journal=IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=2481–2494 |year=2013 |doi=10.1109/TAC.2013.2259207}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. In this case, the Kalman filter needs to be replace by a nonlinear filter providing an estimate of the (strict sense) conditional mean
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{x}(t)= \operatorname E\{ x(t)\mid {\cal Y}_t\},
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
{\cal Y}_t:=\sigma\{ y(\tau), \tau\in [0,t]\}, \quad 0\leq t\leq T,
&lt;/math&gt;
is the ''filtration'' generated by the output process; i.e., the family of increasing sigma fields representing the data as it is produced.

In the early literature on the separation principle it was common to allow as admissible controls &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; all processes that are ''adapted'' to the filtration &lt;math&gt;\{{\cal Y}_t, \, 0\leq t\leq T\}&lt;/math&gt;. This is equivalent to allowing all non-anticipatory [[Borel function]]s as feedback laws, which raises the question of existence of a unique solution to the equations of the feedback loop. Moreover, one needs to exclude the possibility that a nonlinear controller extracts more information from the data than what is possible with a linear control law&lt;ref name="lindquist"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anders Lindquist|title=On Feedback Control of Linear Stochastic Systems |journal=SIAM Journal on Control |volume=11  |pages=323–343 |year=1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Choices of the class of admissible control laws==

Linear-quadratic control problems are often solved by a completion-of-squares argument. In our present context we have
:&lt;math&gt;
J(u)=\operatorname{E}\left\{ \int_0^T(u-Kx)'R(u-Kx) \, dt\right\}
+\text{terms that do not depend on }u,
&lt;/math&gt;
in which the first term takes the form&lt;ref name="astrom"&gt;{{cite book |author=Karl Johan Astrom |title=Introduction to Stochastic Control Theory |publisher=Academic Press |volume=58 |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-486-44531-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}\left\{ \int_0^T(u-Kx)'R(u-Kx)\,dt\right\}=\operatorname{E}\left\{\int_0^T[(u-K\hat{x})'R(u-K\hat{x})+\operatorname{tr}(K'RK\Sigma)] \, dt\right\},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the covariance matrix
:&lt;math&gt;
\Sigma(t):=\operatorname{E}\{[x(t)-\hat{x}(t)][x(t)-\hat{x}(t)]'\}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The separation principle would now follow immediately if &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\Sigma\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; were independent of the control. However this needs to be established.

The state equation can be integrated to take the form
:&lt;math&gt;
x(t)=x_0(t)+\int_0^t \Phi(t,s)B_1(s)u(s) \, ds,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is the state process obtained by setting &lt;math&gt;u=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the transition matrix function. By linearity, &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}(t)=\operatorname{E}\{x(t)\mid {\cal Y}_t\}&lt;/math&gt; equals
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{x}(t)=\hat{x}_0(t)+\int_0^t \Phi(t,s)B_1(s)u(s)\,ds,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_0(t)=\operatorname{E}\{x_0(t)\mid {\cal Y}_t\}&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently,
:&lt;math&gt;
\Sigma(t):=\mathbb{E}\{[x_0(t)-\hat{x}_0(t)][x_0(t)-\hat{x}_0(t)]'\},
&lt;/math&gt;
but we need to establish that &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\hat{x}_0\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the control. This would be the case if
:&lt;math&gt;
{\cal Y}_t ={\cal Y}_t^0:=\sigma\{ y_0(\tau), \tau\in [0,t]\}, \quad 0\leq t\leq T,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; is the output process obtained by setting &lt;math&gt;u=0&lt;/math&gt;. This issue was discussed in detail by Lindquist&lt;ref name="lindquist" /&gt;. In fact, since the control process &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is in general a ''nonlinear'' function of the data and thus non-Gaussian, then so is the output process &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. To avoid these problems one might begin by uncoupling the feedback loop and determine an optimal control process in the class of stochastic processes &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; that are adapted to the family &lt;math&gt;\{  {\cal Y}_t^0\}&lt;/math&gt; of sigma fields. This problem, where one optimizes over the class of all control processes adapted to a fixed filtration,  is called a ''stochastic open loop (SOL) problem''&lt;ref name="lindquist" /&gt;. It is not uncommon in the literature to assume from the outset that the control is adapted to &lt;math&gt;\{ {\mathcal Y}_t^0\}&lt;/math&gt;; see, e.g., Section 2.3 in Bensoussan&lt;ref name="Bensoussan"&gt;{{cite book |author=A. Bensoussan |title=Stochastic Control of Partially Observable Systems |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, also van Handel &lt;ref name="vanHandel"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ramon van Handel |title=Stochastic Calculus, Filtering, and Stochastic Control |publisher=unpublished notes | url=https://web.math.princeton.edu/~rvan/acm217/ACM217.pdf |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Willems&lt;ref name="Willems78''&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jan C. Willems.
 |title=Recursive filtering|journal=Statistica Neerlandica |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=1–39 |year=1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In Lindquist 1973&lt;ref name="lindquist" /&gt; a procedure was proposed for how to embed the class of admissible controls in various SOL classes in a problem-dependent manner, and then construct the corresponding feedback law. The largest class &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; of admissible feedback laws &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; consists  of the non-anticipatory functions &lt;math&gt;u:=\pi(y)&lt;/math&gt; such that the feedback equation  has a unique solution and the corresponding control process &lt;math&gt;u_\pi&lt;/math&gt; is adapted to &lt;math&gt;\{{\mathcal Y}_t^0\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Next, we give a few examples of specific classes of feedback laws that belong to this general class, as well as some other strategies in the literature  to overcome the problems described above.

===Linear control laws===
The admissible class &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; of control laws could be restricted to contain only certain linear ones as in Davis&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book |author=M.H.A. Davis |title=Linear Estimation and Stochastic Control |publisher=Chapman and Hall |year=1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. More generally, the linear class
:&lt;math&gt;
({\mathcal L})\quad u(t)=\bar{u}(t)+\int_0^tF(t,\tau)\,dy,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt; is a deterministic function and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; kernel, ensures that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the control&lt;ref name="lindquist1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lindquist" /&gt;. In fact,  the Gaussian property will then be preserved, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; will be generated by the Kalman filter. Then  the error process &lt;math&gt;\tilde{x}:= x-\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; is generated by
:&lt;math&gt;
d\tilde{x}=(A-LC)\tilde{x}\,dt +(B_2-LD)\,dw, \quad \tilde{x}(0)=x(0),
&lt;/math&gt;
which is clearly independent of the choice of control, and thus so is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

===Lipschitz-continuous control laws===
Wonham&lt;ref name="Wonham"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Murray Wonham |title=On the separation theorem of stochastic control |journal=SIAM J. Control |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=312–326 |year=1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; proved a separation theorem for controls in the class  &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\pi:\, u(t)=\psi(t,\hat{x}(t))\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;, even for a more general cost functional than J(u). However, the proof is far from simple and there are many technical assumptions. For example, &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}C(t)\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; must square and have a determinant bounded away from zero, which is a serious restriction. A later proof by Fleming and Rishel&lt;ref name="FlemingRishel"&gt;{{cite book |author=W.H. Fleming and R.W. Rishel |title=Deterministic and Stochastic Optimal Control |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is considerably simpler. They also prove the separation theorem with quadratic cost functional &lt;math&gt;J(u)&lt;/math&gt; for a class of Lipschitz continuous  feedback laws, namely &lt;math&gt;u(t)=\phi(t,y)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\phi:\, [0,T]\times C^n [0,T]\to{\mathbb R}^m&lt;/math&gt; is a non-anticipatory function of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; which is Lipschitz continuous in this argument. Kushner&lt;ref name="Kushner"&gt;{{cite book |author=H. Kushner |title=Introduction to Stochastic Control |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a more restricted class &lt;math&gt;u(t)=\psi(t,\hat{\xi}(t))&lt;/math&gt;, where the modified state process &lt;math&gt;\hat{\xi}&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{\xi}(t)=\operatorname{E}\{ x_0(t)\mid {\mathcal Y}_t^0\}+ \int_0^t \Phi(t,s)B_1(s)u(s)\,ds,
&lt;/math&gt;
leading to the identity &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\hat{x}=\hat{\xi}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Imposing delay===

If there is a delay in the processing of the observed data so that, for each &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a function of &lt;math&gt;y(\tau); \, 0\leq\tau\leq t-\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;{\cal Y}_t ={\cal Y}_t^0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0\leq t\leq T&lt;/math&gt;, see Example 3 in Georgiou and Lindquist&lt;ref name="GL2013" /&gt;.  Consequently &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the control. Nevertheless, the control policy &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; must be such that the feedback equations have a unique solution.

Consequently the problem with possibly control-dependent sigma fields  does not occur in the usual discrete-time formulation. However, a procedure used in several textbooks to construct  the continuous-time &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; as the limit of finite difference quotients of the discrete-time &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, which does not depend on the control, is circular or a best incomplete; see Remark 4 in Georgiou and Lindquist&lt;ref name="GL2013" /&gt;.

===Weak solutions===

An approach  introduced by Duncan and Varaiya&lt;ref name="duncanvaraiya"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tyrone Duncan and Pravin Varaiya |title=On the solutions of a stochastic control system |journal=SIAM J. Control |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=354–371 |year=1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and  Davis and Varaiya&lt;ref name="davisvaraiya"&gt;{{cite journal |author=M.H.A. Davis and P. Varaiya |title=Information states for stochastic systems |journal=J. Math. Anal. Applications |volume=37 |pages=384–402 |year=1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, see also Section 2.4 in Bensoussan&lt;ref name="Bensoussan" /&gt;
is based on ''weak solutions''  of the  stochastic differential equation. Considering such solutions of
:&lt;math&gt;
dx =A(t)x(t)\,dt+B_1(t)u(t)\,dt+B_2(t)\,dw
&lt;/math&gt;
we can change the probability measure (that depends on &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}u\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;) via a [[Girsanov]] transformation so that
:&lt;math&gt;
d\tilde{w}:= B_1(t)u(t)\,dt+B_2(t)\,dw
&lt;/math&gt;
becomes a new Wiener process, which (under the new probability measure) can be assumed to be unaffected by the control. The question of how this could be implemented in an engineering system is left open.

===Nonlinear filtering solutions===

Although a nonlinear control law will produce a non-Gaussian state process, it can be shown, using  nonlinear filtering theory (Chapters 16.1 in Lipster and Shirayev&lt;ref name="LipsterShirayev"&gt;{{cite book |author=R.S. Liptser and A.N. Shirayev |title=Statistics of Random Processes II, Applications |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
), that the state process is ''conditionally Gaussian'' given the filtration &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\{{\mathcal Y}_t\}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;. This fact can be used to show that &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\hat{x}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; is actually generated by a Kalman filter (see Chapters 11 and 12 in Lipster and Shirayev&lt;ref name="LipsterShirayev" /&gt;). However, this requires quite a sophisticated analysis and is restricted to the case where the driving noise &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}w\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; is a Wiener process.

Additional historical perspective can be found in Mitter&lt;ref name="mitter"&gt;{{cite journal |author=S. Mitter |title=Filtering and stochastic control: A historical perspective |journal=IEEE Control Systems Magazine |volume=13(3) |pages=67–76 |year=1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Issues on feedback in linear stochastic systems==

At this point it is suitable to consider a more general class of controlled linear stochastic systems that also covers systems with time delays, namely
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   z(t) &amp; =z_0(t) + \int_0^t G(t,s)u(s)\,ds  \\
   y(t) &amp; = Hz(t)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}z_0\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; a stochastic vector process which does not depend on the control&lt;ref name="lindquist" /&gt;. The standard stochastic system is then obtained as a the special case where &lt;math&gt;z=[x',y']'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z_0=[x_0',y_0']'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H=[I,0]&lt;/math&gt;. We shall use the short-hand notation
:&lt;math&gt;
z=z_0+g\pi Hz
&lt;/math&gt;
for the feedback system, where
:&lt;math&gt;
g\;:\; (t,u) \mapsto \int_0^t G(t,\tau)u(\tau)\,d\tau
&lt;/math&gt;
is a Volterra operator.

In this more general formulation the embedding procedure of Lindquist&lt;ref name="lindquist" /&gt; defines the class &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; of admissible feedback laws &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; as the class of non-anticipatory functions &lt;math&gt;u:=\pi(y)&lt;/math&gt; such that the feedback equation &lt;math&gt;z=z_0+g\pi Hz&lt;/math&gt; has a unique solution &lt;math&gt;z_\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u=\pi(Hz_\pi)&lt;/math&gt; is adapted to &lt;math&gt;\{{\mathcal Y}_t^0\}&lt;/math&gt;.

In Georgiou and Lindquist&lt;ref name="GL2013" /&gt; a new framework for the separation principle was proposed.  This approach considers stochastic systems as well-defined maps between sample paths rather than between stochastic processes  and allows us to extend the separation principle to systems driven by martingales with possible jumps. The approach is motivated by engineering thinking where systems and feedback loops process signals, and not stochastic processes ''per se'' or transformations of probability measures. Hence the purpose is to create a natural class of admissible control laws that make engineering sense, including those that are nonlinear and discontinuous.

The feedback equation &lt;math&gt;z=z_0+g\pi Hz&lt;/math&gt; has a unique strong solution if there exists a non-anticipating function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;z=F(z_0)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies  the equation with probability one and all other solutions coincide with &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; with probability one. However, in the sample-wise setting, more is required, namely that such a unique solution exists and that &lt;math&gt;z=z_0+g\pi Hz&lt;/math&gt; holds for all &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;, not just almost all. The resulting feedback loop is ''deterministically well-posed''in the sense that the feedback equations admit a unique solution that causally depends on the input for ''each'' input sample path.

In this context, a ''signal'' is defined to be a sample path of a stochastic process with possible discontinuities. More precisely, signals will belong to the ''Skorohod space'' &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the space of functions which are continuous on the right and have a left limit at all points ([[càdlàg]] functions). In particular, the space &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of continuous functions is a proper subspace of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the response of a typical nonlinear operation that involves  thresholding and switching can be modeled as a signal.  The same goes for sample paths of counting processes and other martingales.  A ''system'' is defined to be a measurable non-anticipatory map &lt;math&gt;D\to D&lt;/math&gt; sending sample paths to sample paths so that their outputs at any time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is a measurable function of past values of the input and  time. For example, stochastic differential equations with Lipschitz coefficients driven by a Wiener process
induce maps between corresponding path spaces, see page 127 in Rogers and Williams&lt;ref name="RogersWilliams"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rogers, L. Chris G., and David Williams |title=Diffusions, Markov processes and martingales: Volume 2, Itô calculus |publisher=Cambridge university press |year=2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, and pages 126-128 in Klebaner&lt;ref name="Klebaner"&gt;{{cite book |author=Klebaner, Fima C. |title=Introduction to Stochastic Calculus with Applications |publisher=World Scientific Publishing Company |year=2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, under fairly general conditions (see e.g., Chapter V in Protter&lt;ref name="Protter"&gt;{{cite book |author=P.E Protter, Fima C. |title=Stochastic Integration and Differential Equations |publisher=Springer |year=2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;), stochastic differential equations driven by martingales with sample paths in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; have strong solutions who are semi-martingales.

For the time setting &lt;math&gt;f(z):=g\pi Hz&lt;/math&gt;, the feedback system &lt;math&gt;z=z_0+g\pi Hz&lt;/math&gt; can be written &lt;math&gt;z=z_0+f(z)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as an input.

'''''Definition.''''' A feedback loop &lt;math&gt;z=z_0+f(z)&lt;/math&gt; is ''deterministically well-posed'' if it has a unique solution &lt;math&gt;z\in D&lt;/math&gt; for all inputs &lt;math&gt;z_0\in D&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;(1-f)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a system.

This implies that the processes &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; define identical filtrations&lt;ref name="GL2013" /&gt;. Consequently no new information is created by the loop. However, what we need is that &lt;math&gt;{\cal Y}_t ={\cal Y}_t^0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0\leq t\leq T&lt;/math&gt;. This is ensured by the following lemma (Lemma 8 in Georgiou and Lindquist&lt;ref name="GL2013" /&gt;).

'''''Key Lemma.''''' If the feedback loop &lt;math&gt;z=z_0+g\pi Hz&lt;/math&gt; is deterministically well-posed, &lt;math&gt;g\pi&lt;/math&gt; is a system, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a linear system having a right inverse &lt;math&gt;H^{-R}&lt;/math&gt; that is also a system, then &lt;math&gt;(1-Hg\pi)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;  is a system and &lt;math&gt;{\cal Y}_t ={\cal Y}_t^0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0\leq t\leq T&lt;/math&gt;.

The condition on &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in this lemma is clearly satisfied in the standard linear stochastic system, for which &lt;math&gt;H=[0,I]&lt;/math&gt;, and hence &lt;math&gt;H^{-R}=H'&lt;/math&gt;. The remauining conditions are collected in the following definition.

'''''Definition.''''' A feedback law &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is ''deterministically well-posed'' for the system &lt;math&gt;z=z_0+g\pi Hz&lt;/math&gt;  if &lt;math&gt;g\pi&lt;/math&gt; is a system and the feedback system &lt;math&gt;z=z_0+g\pi Hz&lt;/math&gt; deterministically well-posed.

Examples of simple systems that are not deterministically  well-posed are given in Remark 12 in Georgiou and Lindquist&lt;ref name="GL2013" /&gt;.

==A separation principle for physically realizable control laws==

By only considering feedback laws that are deterministically well-posed, all admissible control laws are physically realizable in the engineering sense  that they induce a signal that travels through the feedback loop.
The proof of the following theorem can be found in Georgiou and Lindquist 2013&lt;ref name="GL2013" /&gt;.

'''''Separation theorem.'''''
Given the linear stochastic system
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
   dx &amp;  =A(t)x(t)\,dt+B_1(t)u(t)\,dt+B_2(t)\,dw \\
   dy &amp;  =C(t)x(t)\,dt +D(t)\,dw
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is a vector-valued Wiener process, &lt;math&gt;x(0)&lt;/math&gt; is a zero-mean Gaussian random vector independent of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, consider the problem of minimizing the quadratic functional J(u) over the class of all deterministically well-posed feedback laws &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. Then the unique optimal control law is given by &lt;math&gt;u(t)=K(t)\hat{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is defined as above and &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; is given by the Kalman filter. More generally, if &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is a square-integrable martingale and  &lt;math&gt;x(0)&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary zero mean random vector, &lt;math&gt;u(t)=K(t)\hat{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}(t)=\operatorname{E}\{x(t)\mid {\cal Y}_t\}&lt;/math&gt;, is the optimal control law provided it is deterministically well-posed.

In the general non-Gaussian case, which may involve counting processes, the Kalman filter needs to be replaced by an nonlinear filter.

==A Separation principle for delay-differential systems==

Stochastic control for time-delay systems were first studied in Lindquist&lt;ref name="L68"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anders Lindquist |title=On optimal stochastic control with smoothed information |journal=Information Sciences |volume=1 |pages=55–85 |year=1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="L69"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anders Lindquist |title=An innovations approach to optimal control of linear stochastic systems with time delay |journal=Information Sciences |volume=1 |pages=279–295 |year=1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lindquist1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lindquist" /&gt;,
and Brooks&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;{{cite journal |author=R. Brooks |title=Linear Stochastic Control: An extended separation principle |journal=J. Math. Anal. Appl. |volume=38 |pages=569 – 587 |year=1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, although Brooks relies on the strong assumption that the observation &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is ''functionally independent'' of the control &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, thus avoiding the key question of feedback.

Consider the delay-differential system&lt;ref name="lindquist1" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
dx    &amp;=\left(\int_{t-h}^t d_s\,A(t,s)x(s)\right) \,dt + B_1(t)u(t)\,dt+B_2(t)\,dw   \\
 dy   &amp; =\left(\int_{t-h}^t d_s\,C(t,s)x(s)\right) \,dt +D(t)\,dw
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is now a (square-integrable) Gaussian (vector) martingale, and where &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}A\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are of bounded variation in the first argument and continuous on the right in the second, &lt;math&gt;x(t)=\xi(t)&lt;/math&gt; is deterministic for &lt;math&gt;-h\leq t\leq 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;y(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
More precisely, &lt;math&gt;A(t,s)=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;s\geq t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A(t,s)=A(t,t-h)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t\leq t-h&lt;/math&gt;, and the total variation of &lt;math&gt;s\mapsto A(t,s)&lt;/math&gt; is bounded by an integrable function in the variable &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and the same holds for &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.

We want to determine a control law which minimizes
:&lt;math&gt;
J(u)=\operatorname{E}\left(\int_0^T x(t)'Q(t)x(t)\,d\alpha(t)+\int_0^Tu(t)'R(t)u(t)\,dt\right),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}d\alpha\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; is a positive Stieltjes measure. The corresponding deterministic problem obtained by setting &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}w=0\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
u(t)=\int_{t-h}^t d_\tau \, K(t,\tau)x(\tau),
&lt;/math&gt;
with&lt;ref name="lindquist1" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}K\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.

The following separation principle for the delay system above can be found in Georgiou and Lindquist 2013&lt;ref name="GL2013" /&gt; and generalizes the corresponding result in Lindquist 1973&lt;ref name="lindquist1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anders Lindquist|title=Optimal control of linear stochastic systems with applications to time lag systems |journal=Information Sciences|volume=5|pages=81–126|year=1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Theorem.''''' There is a unique feedback law &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\pi:\, y\mapsto u\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;  in the class of deterministically well-posed control laws that minimizes &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}J(u)\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;, and it is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
u(t)=\int_{t-h}^t d_s \, K(t,s)\hat{x}(s\mid t),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the deterministic control gain and &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}(s\mid t) := E\{ x(s)\mid {\cal Y}_t\}&lt;/math&gt; is given by the linear (distributed) filter
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  d\hat{x}(t\mid t)  &amp;  =\int_{t-h}^t d_s \, A(t,s)\hat{x}(s\mid t) \, dt +B_1u\,dt+ X(t,t)\,dv \\
  d\hat{x}(t\mid t)  &amp;  =\int_{t-h}^t d_s \, A(t,s)\hat{x}(s\mid t) \, dt +B_1u\,dt+ X(t,t)\,dv
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the innovation process
:&lt;math&gt;
dv=dy - \int_{t-h}^t d_sC(t,s)\hat{x}(s\mid t)\, dt, \quad v(0)=0,
&lt;/math&gt;
and the gain &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is as defined in page 120 in Lindquist.&lt;ref name="lindquist1" /&gt;

[[File:3 PAO 30M 2007-07-12.jpg|thumb|right|A bottle of shower gel]]
[[File:Shower Gel.jpg|thumb|Shower jellies]]
'''Shower gel''' (also '''shower cream''' or '''body wash''') is a specialized [[liquid]] product used for cleaning the body during showers. Not to be confused with [[Liquid soap|liquid soaps]], shower gels, in fact, do not contain saponified oil. Instead, it uses synthetic detergents derived from either [[petroleum]] or plant sources.

Body washes and shower gels holds a lower [[pH]] value than the traditional soap, which is also known to feel less drying to the skin. In certain cases, [[sodium stearate]] is added to the chemical combination to create a solid version of the shower gel.

== History ==
Shower gel is a derivative invention of the liquid soap, which first appeared in the 1800s. In 1865, William Shepphard patented the formula behind the liquid soap&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/resource/rdc00000822/on-this-day-aug-22-patent-for-liquid-soap?cmpid=CDC00000822|title=On This Day – August 22 : The first patent for liquid soap was issued to William Sheppard on this day in 1865- Learn Chemistry|website=www.rsc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but the product gained eventual popularity with the rise of [[Palmolive soap]] in 1898, by B.J. Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-soaps-and-detergents-4072778|title=The Cleanest Inventions: Soaps and Detergents|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern chemistry later{{when|date=September 2018}} enabled the creation of the shower gel, which specialized in cleaning the entire body during baths and showers.

== Properties ==

Shower gels are known to consist of the same basic ingredients as soap - water, [[betaine]]s, and [[sodium laureth sulfate]], or SLS. But the main difference between the two products lie in its [[surfactant]]s - compounds known to lower the surface tension between substances, which helps in the emulsification and the washing away of oily dirt. The surfactants of shower gels do not come from [[saponification]], that is by reacting a type of oil or fat with [[lye]]. Instead, it uses synthetic [[detergent]]s for surfactants derived from either plant-based sources or petroleum. This gives the product a lower pH value than soap&lt;ref name="Pai 2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.glamour.com/story/bar-soap-benefits-versus-body-wash|title=Please Help Me Understand Why You Still Use Bar Soap|last=Pai|first=Deanna|date=November 23, 2016|website=Glamour|access-date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and might also feel less drying to the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/better/pop-culture/how-take-shower-according-dermatologists-ncna740526|title=Try these 11 expert tips for a better shower; your skin will thank you|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people have likened the effect to feeling less ''squeaky clean'', however. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wellandgood.com/good-looks/danger-of-being-squeaky-clean-after-shower/|title=Why you shouldn’t *actually* want to be squeaky-clean after a shower|website=Well+Good|language=en|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Surfactants can make up as much as 50 percent of the shower gel content, with the remaining proportion being made up of a combination of water and ingredients to thicken, preserve, emulsify, add fragrance, and color.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Make Your Own Soap|last=Hornsey|first=Sally|publisher=Constable &amp; Robinson|year=2014|isbn=9781908974235|location=London, England|pages=24, 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cosmetic and Toiletry Formulations, Second Edition, Volume 2|last=Flick|first=Ernest|publisher=Noyes Publications|year=1992|isbn=0815513062|location=Park Ridge, New Jersey|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple surfactants are often used to achieve desired product qualities. A primary surfactant can provide good foaming ability and cleaning effectiveness, while a secondary surfactant can add qualities of mildness to prevent irritation or over-drying of the skin. To prevent shower gel ingredients from separating, emulsifiers such as diethanolamine are added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chemservice.com/news/2014/08/examine-the-chemistry-of-body-wash/|title=EXAMINE THE CHEMISTRY OF BODY WASH|last=Boyd|first=Christopher|date=4 August 2014|website=www.chemservice.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conditioning agents may also be added to moisturize the skin during and after product use.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chemistscorner.com/cosmetic-formulations-body-wash/|title=Cosmetic Formulations – Body Wash – Chemists Corner|website=chemistscorner.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also available in different colours and scents.&lt;ref name="Guarnieri 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fashionmagazine.com/beauty/how-we-bathe/|title=Bar soap vs. shower gel: A brief look at the history of how we bathe|last=Guarnieri|first=Anne-Marie|date=January 6, 2014|website=Fashion|access-date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingredients, like scent in the form of essential oils or fragrance oils&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and colorant in the form of water soluble dyes are common in shower gels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

[[Microbead|Microbeads]] were commonly used in shower gels until recently. Microbeads are tiny spheres of plastic that were added to a variety of cosmetic products for their exfoliating qualities.  They are too small to filter out of water systems and end up in waterways and oceans, potentially passing toxins to animal life and humans. Following the legislative actions of other countries, the United States passed the [[Microbead-Free Waters Act 2015|Microbead-Free Waters Act]] in 2015, which bans microbeads in the U.S. incrementally starting in 2017, with full implementation set for 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bailey Bischoff Staff|first=|date=18 April 2018|title=How the world made macro strides in curbing microbeads.|url=|journal=Christian Science Monitor|volume=|pages=|via=MAS Ultra - School Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shower gels for men may contain the ingredient [[menthol]], which gives a cooling and stimulating sensation on the skin, and some men's shower gels are also designed specifically for use on hair and body. Shower gels contain milder surfactant bases than shampoos, and some also contain gentle conditioning agents in the formula. This means that shower gels can also double as an effective and perfectly acceptable substitute to shampoo,{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} even if they are not labelled as a hair and body wash. Washing hair with shower gel should give approximately the same result as using a moisturising shampoo.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Marketing ==

Like shampoo and bubble bath products, many are marketed directly towards children. These often feature scents intended to appeal to children, such as fruit scents, or cookies or cotton candy scents. Many bottles feature popular characters from children's television or movies. As with men's body wash, they often are specifically designed to be used also as a shampoo and conditioner. They also often contain gentle ingredients designed for young skin.

[[Image:SiPM IRST.JPG|300px|thumb|One of the first SiPM produced by FBK research center (formerly IRST) located in Trento, Italy. See http://www.fbk.eu.]]
'''Silicon photomultipliers''', often called "'''SiPM'''" in the literature, are [[Solid-state electronics|solid-state]] single-[[photon]]-sensitive devices based on [[Single-photon avalanche diode]] (SPAD) implemented on common silicon substrate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in2p3.fr/actions/formation/microelectronique13/Cours_SiPM_Dinu_preliminary.pdf Détecteurs SiPM]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://indico.cern.ch/event/117424/contributions/1329247/attachments/56777/81753/STMicroelectronics_SIPM_CERN_2011-02-17.pdf Silicon Photom ultiplier Technology at STMicroelectronics From SPAD to SiPM]&lt;/ref&gt; The dimension of each single SPAD can vary from 10 to 100 micrometres, and their density can be up to 10000 per square millimeter. Every SPAD in SiPM operates in [[Single-photon avalanche diode|Geiger mode]] and is coupled with the others by a metal or [[polysilicon]] quenching resistor. Although the device works in digital/switching mode, most of SiPM are an [[analog device]] because all the microcells are read in parallel, making it possible to generate signals within a dynamic range from a single [[photon]] to 1000 [[photon]]s for a device with just a square-millimeter area. More advanced readout schemes are utilized for the [[lidar]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/group3/7d/85/c8/95/fb/3b/4e/2d/DM00452094/files/DM00452094.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00452094.pdf A new generation, long distance ranging Time-of-Flight sensor based on ST’s FlightSense™ technology]&lt;/ref&gt; The supply voltage (''V''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) depends on APD technology used and typically varies between 20 V and 100 V, thus being from 15 to 75 times lower than the voltage required for a traditional [[Photomultiplier|photomultiplier tubes]] (PMTs) operation.

Typical specifications for a SiPM:
# Photo detection efficiency (PDE) ranges from 20 to 50%, depending on device and wavelength, being similar to a traditional [[Photomultiplier tube|PMT]].
# Gain (''G'') is also similar to a [[Photomultiplier tube|PMT]], being about 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.
# ''G'' vs. ''V''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; dependence is linear, does not follow a [[power law]] like in the case of [[Photomultiplier tube|PMT]]s.
# Timing jitter is optimized to have a photon arrival time resolution of about 100-300 ps.
# Signal decay time is inversely proportional to square root of photoelectrons number within an excitation event.
# The signal parameters are practically independent of external magnetic fields, in contrast to vacuum [[Photomultiplier tube|PMT]]s.
# Aftepulsing probability (3-30%) define probability of spurious second pulse on single photon arrival.
# Dark count density is frequency of pulses in absence of illumination (10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; pulses/s/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
# Small dimensions permit extremely compact, light and robust mechanical design.

SiPM for medical imaging are attractive candidates for the replacement of the conventional [[Photomultiplier tube|PMT]] in [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[SPECT]] imaging, since they provide high gain with low voltage and fast response, they are very compact and compatible with magnetic resonance setups. Nevertheless, there are still several challenges, for example, SiPM requires optimization for larger matrices, signal amplification and digitization.

'''Sitronics''' ({{lang-ru|Ситро́никс}}) is a microelectronics company based in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] and controlled by [[Sistema]] holding, that also manufactures mobile phones. Its main assets are the [[Fabs|electronics fabs]], research and development facilities [[Mikron Group|NIIME and Mikron]] in [[Zelenograd]], and other facilities elsewhere in [[Eastern Europe]].

Despite losses in 2007, the company is planning to remain a part of Sistema and to expand its product portfolio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/sitronics-idUSL1238527320080212|title=Russia's Sitronics sets new product strategy|date=12 February 2008|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; bidding for large telecommunications contracts such as a $1 billion deal to build a network in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aUa6Nxjbf9E8&amp;refer=india|title=Sistema Plans to Borrow $10 Billion to Expand Network (Update1)|website=Bloomberg.com|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020165111/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aUa6Nxjbf9E8&amp;refer=india|archivedate=2012-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sitronics was founded in 1997 in [[Zelenograd]] and was initially named "Scientific Center". In January 2005 its headquarters was moved to [[Moscow]] and in November 2005 the company got its current name. On February 7, 2007 the company placed an [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] on the [[London Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120096958852205497|title=Russia Has a Tough Sell|first1=Andrew|last1=Langley|first2=Leos|last2=Rousek|date=22 January 2008|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a series of acquisitions it has become a leading Russian microelectronics company with revenues exceeding $1 billion in the first 9 months of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitronics.com/site/10/article/94/|title=Sitronics :: Press Releases|date=5 June 2008|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605072808/http://www.sitronics.com/site/10/article/94/|archivedate=5 June 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sistema Gets Full Control of Sitronics|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/sistema-gets-full-control-of-sitronics-17240|accessdate=27 August 2017|publisher=Moscow Times|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telecommunications==
The company will produce nano-SIM cards on orders from one of Russia’s big three mobile phone operators to be used in new Apple iPhones. The first batch will comprise about 50,000 cards that will be used in iPhone 5 gadgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rian.ru/business/20120821/175349639.html |title=Russia’s ‘Big Three’ Mobile Firm Orders Sitronics NanoSIMs for iPhone 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sitronics also makes an array of mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mob.org/phone/sitronics/|title=Sitronics phones and smartphones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Snapchat''' is a [[multimedia]] [[messaging app]] used globally, created by [[Evan Spiegel]], [[Bobby Murphy (businessman)|Bobby Murphy]], and Reggie Brown,&lt;ref name="settlement"/&gt; former students at [[Stanford University]], and developed by [[Snap Inc.]], originally Snapchat Inc.

One of the principal features of Snapchat is that pictures and messages are usually only available for a short time before they become inaccessible to users. The app has evolved from originally focusing on person-to-person photo sharing to presently featuring users' "Stories" of 24 hours of chronological content, along with "Discover", letting brands show ad-supported short-form content.

Snapchat has become notable for representing a new, mobile-first direction for [[social media]], and places significant emphasis on users interacting with virtual stickers and [[augmented reality]] objects. As of February 2018, Snapchat has 187&amp;nbsp;million daily active users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/|title=Snapchat daily active users 2017 - Statistic|website=Statista}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/snap-inc-earnings-q4-2017/|title=Snap shares skyrocket on first earnings beat with revived user growth – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{For timeline|Timeline of Snapchat}}

=== Prototype ===
According to documents and [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] statements, Reggie Brown brought the idea for a disappearing pictures application to [[Evan Spiegel]] because Spiegel had prior business experience. Brown and Spiegel then pulled in [[Bobby Murphy (businessman)|Bobby Murphy]], who had experience [[Computer program|coding]]. The three worked closely together for several months and launched Snapchat as "Picaboo" on the [[iOS]] operating system on July 8, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Edwards |title=The alleged betrayal described in these photos, texts, and emails cost Snapchat $158 million |url=http://nordic.businessinsider.com/snapchat-founders-lawsuit-internal-photos-texts-emails-2017-2 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=February 3, 2017 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Billy |last=Gallagher |title=Snapchat’s Spiegel Admits Brown "Came Up With The Idea For Disappearing Picture Messages" In New Court Documents |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/new-snapchat-docs/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=July 1, 2013 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reggie Brown was ousted from the company months after it was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-live-updates-snap-ipo-what-happened-to-ousted-snapchat-1488401913-htmlstory.html#|title=What happened to ousted Snapchat founder Reggie Brown? No, really, we don't know|last=Masunaga|first=Samantha|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The app was relaunched as Snapchat in September 2011, and the team focused on usability and technical aspects, rather than branding efforts.&lt;ref name="Forbes, touch" /&gt; One exception was the decision to keep a mascot designed by Brown, "Ghostface Chillah", named after [[Ghostface Killah]] of the hip-hop group [[Wu-Tang Clan]].&lt;ref name="Forbes, touch" /&gt;

On May 8, 2012, Reggie Brown sent an email to Evan Spiegel during their senior year at Stanford in which he offered to re-negotiate his equitable share regarding ownership of the company. Lawyers for Snapchat responded by insisting that he had never had any creative connection to the product. The attorneys also accused Brown of committing [[fraud]] against Spiegel and Murphy by falsely claiming to be a product inventor. On behalf of their clients, the law firm concluded that [[Snap Inc.#Controversy|Reggie Brown]] had made no contributions of value or worth, and was therefore entitled to a share of nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Original document, [http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/725391-151160912-snapchat-reggie-brown-declaration.html "151160912 Snapchat Reggie Brown Declaration"], ''Sam Biddle Documentcloud'', July 10, 2013.

In their first [[blog]] post, dated May 9, 2012, [[CEO]] Evan Spiegel described the company's mission: "Snapchat isn’t about capturing the traditional [[Kodak]] moment. It’s about communicating with the full range of human emotion — not just what appears to be pretty or perfect."&lt;ref name="let's chat"&gt;{{cite web |first=Evan |last=Spiegel |authorlink=Evan Spiegel |title=Let's chat. |url=https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/page/7/ |website=Snap News |publisher=[[Snap Inc.]] |date=May 9, 2012 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented Snapchat as the solution to stresses caused by the longevity of personal information on social media, evidenced by "emergency detagging of [[Facebook]] photos before job interviews and [[photo manipulation|photoshopping]] blemishes out of candid shots before they hit the internet".&lt;ref name="let's chat"/&gt;

As of May 2012, 25 Snapchat images were being sent per second&lt;ref name="TC, billion snaps" /&gt; and, as of November 2012, users had shared over one billion photos on the Snapchat iOS app, with 20 million photos being shared per day.&lt;ref name="TC, billion snaps" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Upstart, 28 October"&gt;{{cite news|title=The app with self-destructing messages launches on Android|url=http://upstart.bizjournals.com/news/technology/2012/10/29/snapchat-launches-on-android.html|accessdate=December 22, 2012|newspaper=Upstart Business Journal|date=October 27, 2012|author=del Castillo, Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, Spiegel cited problems with user base [[scalability]] as the reason why Snapchat was experiencing some difficulties delivering its images, known as "snaps", in [[Real-time data|real time]].&lt;ref name="TC, billion snaps" /&gt; Snapchat was released as an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app on October 29, 2012.&lt;ref name="TC, billion snaps" /&gt;

In June 2013, Snapchat version 5.0, dubbed "[[Banquo]]", was released for iOS. The updated version introduced several speed and design enhancements, including swipe navigation, double-tap to reply, an improved friend finder, and in-app profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snapchat Update Adds Quicker, Flashier Features|url=http://mashable.com/2013/06/06/snapchat-update/|work=Mashable|publisher=Mashable|accessdate=August 9, 2013|author=Fitz-gerald, Sean |date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is a reference to the ghostly hero from Shakespeare's [[Macbeth]], a character in the play who is ultimately seen to be victorious over evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jordan |last=Crook |title=Snapchat Launches v5.0 With Revamped UI, Swipe Navigation, And In-App Profiles |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/05/snapchat-launches-v5-0-banquo-with-revamped-ui-address-book-friend-finder-and-in-app-profiles/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 5, 2013 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in June 2013, Snapchat introduced Snapkidz for users under 13 years of age. Snapkidz was part of the original Snapchat application and was activated when the user provided a date of birth to verify his/her age. Snapkidz allowed children to take snaps and draw on them, but they could not send snaps to other users and could only save snaps locally on the device being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Larry |last=Magid |title=Snapchat Creates SnapKidz -- A Sandbox For Kids Under 13 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymagid/2013/06/23/snapchat-creates-snapkidz-a-sandbox-for-kids-under-13/ |website=[[Forbes]] |date=June 23, 2013 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Snapchat's published statistics, as of May 2015, the app's users were sending 2 billion videos per day, reaching 6 billion by November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lucas |last=Matney |title=Snapchat Reaches 6 Billion Daily Videos Views, Tripling From 2 Billion In May |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/09/snapchat-reaches-6-billion-daily-videos-views-tripling-from-2-billion-in-may/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=November 9, 2015 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, Snapchat had hit 10 billion daily video views.&lt;ref&gt;Kellen Beck,[http://mashable.com/2016/04/28/snapchat-video-views-billion/ "Snapchat users are watching 10 billion videos a day"], ''Mashable'', April 28, 2016.

In September 2016, Snapchat Inc. was renamed [[Snap Inc.]] to coincide with the introduction of the company's first [[computer hardware|hardware]] product, [[Spectacles (product)|Spectacles]]— [[smartglasses]] with a built-in camera that can record 10 seconds of video at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37460682 |title=Snapchat announces Sunglasses with built-in camera |last=Lee |first=Dave |date=September 24, 2016 |access-date=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 20, 2017, Spectacles became available for purchase online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lexy |last=Savvides |title=Finally!

== Features ==
=== Core functionality ===
Snapchat is primarily used for creating multimedia messages referred to as "snaps"; snaps can consist of a photo or a short video, and can be edited to include filters and effects, text captions, and drawings.&lt;ref name=pocketlint-7tips&gt;{{cite web|title=7 Snapchat tips and tricks you probably had no clue about|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/132491-7-snapchat-tips-and-tricks-you-probably-had-no-clue-about|website=Pocket-lint|accessdate=December 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snapchat Hands-on: Send Photos Set to Self-Destruct|url=http://blog.laptopmag.com/hands-on-with-snapchat-send-photos-set-to-self-destruct|work=Laptop|publisher=TechMedia Network|accessdate=September 15, 2013|author=Alba, Davey |date=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snaps can be directed privately to selected contacts, or to a semi-public "Story".&lt;ref name="tc-stories"/&gt; The ability to send video snaps was added as a feature option in December 2012. By holding down on the photo button while inside the app, a video of up to ten seconds in length can be captured. After a single viewing, the video disappears by default. Spiegel explained that this process allowed the video data to be compressed into the size of a photo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=J.J. |last=Colao |title=Snapchat Adds Video, Now Seeing 50 Million Photos A Day |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjcolao/2012/12/14/snapchat-adds-video-now-seeing-50-million-photos-a-day/ |website=[[Forbes]] |date=December 14, 2012 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 2014, the ability to communicate via [[Videoconferencing|video chat]] was added. Direct messaging features were also included in the update, allowing users to send [[ephemerality|ephemeral]] text messages to friends and family while saving any needed information by clicking on it.&lt;ref name="verge-snapchatchat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Romain |last=Dillet |title=Snapchat Adds Ephemeral Text Chat And Video Calls |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/01/snapchat-adds-text-chat-and-video-calls/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=May 1, 2014 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private message photo snaps can be viewed for a user-specified length of time (1 to 10 seconds as determined by the sender) before they become inaccessible. Users were previously required to hold down on the screen in order to view a snap; this behavior was removed in July 2015&lt;ref name="verge-nomoreholding"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sam |last=Sheffer |title=Snapchat is changing the way you watch snaps and add friends |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/1/8861131/snapchat-update-2015-tap-to-play-story |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=July 1, 2015 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement to hold on the screen was intended to frustrate the ability to take [[screenshot]]s of snaps; the Snapchat app does not prevent screenshots from being taken but can notify the sender if it detects that it has been saved. However, these notifications can be bypassed through either unauthorized modifications to the app or by obtaining the image through external means.&lt;ref name="Forbes, touch"&gt;{{cite web |first=J.J. |last=Colao |title=Snapchat: The Biggest No-Revenue Mobile App Since Instagram |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjcolao/2012/11/27/snapchat-the-biggest-no-revenue-mobile-app-since-instagram/ |website=[[Forbes]] |date=November 27, 2012 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TC, billion snaps"&gt;{{cite web |first=Billy |last=Gallagher |title=You Know What’s Cool?

Friends can be added via usernames and phone contacts, using customizable "[[Aztec Code|Snapcodes]]", or through the "Add Nearby" function, which scans for users near their location who are also in the Add Nearby menu.&lt;ref name="verge-nomoreholding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whatshouldmarketers"&gt;{{cite web|title=What marketers should know about Snapchat|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/1186152/sexting-branding-marketers-know-snapchat-nickykc/|work=Brand Republic|publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group]]|accessdate=July 21, 2013|author=Kemp, Nicola |date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiegel explained that Snapchat is intended to counteract the trend of users being compelled to manage an idealized [[online identity]] of themselves, which he says has "taken all of the fun out of communicating".&lt;ref name="Forbes, touch" /&gt;

In November 2014, Snapchat introduced "Snapcash", a feature that lets users send and receive money to each other through private messaging. The payments system is powered by [[Square, Inc.|Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kurt |last=Wagner |title=Snapchat to Let You Send Money to Friends, Thanks to Square |url=https://www.recode.net/2014/11/17/11632930/snapchat-to-let-you-send-money-to-friends-thanks-to-square |website=[[Recode]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 17, 2014 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Snapchat Now Lets You Send Money To Friends Through Snapcash Deal With Square Cash |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/17/snapcash/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=November 17, 2014 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Snapchat introduced a new, optional feature known as "Memories". Memories allows snaps and story posts to be saved into a private storage area, where they can be viewed alongside other photos stored on the device, as well as edited and published as snaps, story posts, or messages. When shared to a user's current story, the memory would have a white frame and timestamp to indicate its age. Content in the Memories storage area can be searched by date or using a local [[object recognition]] system. Snaps accessible within Memories can additionally be placed into a "My Eyes Only" area that is locked with a PIN. Snapchat has stated that the Memories feature was inspired by the practice of manually scrolling through photos on a phone to show them to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Snapchat introduces Memories: a searchable, shareable archive of your snaps |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/6/12102294/snapchat-memories-private-snap-archive |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=July 6, 2016 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, the white border around old memories was removed. While originally intended to let viewers know the material was old, ''[[TechCrunch]]'' wrote that the indicator "ended up annoying users who didn’t want their snaps altered, sometimes to the point where they would decide not to share the old content at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Fitz |last=Tepper |title=Snapchat will no longer show a white border around old Memories |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/27/snapchat-will-no-longer-show-a-white-border-around-old-memories/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=April 27, 2017 |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Zack |last=Gilbert |title=Snapchat stops putting a white border around old Memories |url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2017/04/27/snapchat-stops-putting-white-border-around-old-memories/ |website=MobileSyrup |date=April 27, 2017 |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, an update made it possible to send snaps with unlimited viewing time, dropping the previous ten-second maximum duration, with the content disappearing after being deliberately closed by the recipient. New creative tools, namely the ability to draw with an emoji, videos that play in a loop, and an eraser that lets users remove objects in a photo with the app filling in the space with the background, were also released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Snapchat adds new creative tools as its rivalry with Instagram intensifies |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/9/15592738/snapchat-limitless-snaps-looping-videos-magic-eraser-emoji-drawing |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=May 9, 2017 |accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Snapchat’s new eraser lets you photoshop stuff out of photos |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/09/snapchat-magic-eraser/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=May 9, 2017 |accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Snapchat started allowing users to add links to snaps, enabling them to direct viewers to specific websites; the feature was only available for brands previously. Additionally, the update added more creative tools: A "Backdrop" feature lets users cut out a specific object from their photo and apply colorful patterns to it in order to bring greater emphasis to that object, and "Voice Filters" enable users to remix the sounds of their voices in the snap. Voice Filters was previously available as part of the feature enabling augmented reality lenses, with the new update adding a dedicated speaker icon to remix the audio in any snap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Snapchat lets you add links, voice filters and backdrops to Snaps |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/05/snapchat-links-backdrops-voice-filters/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=July 5, 2017 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Shannon |last=Liao |title=Snapchat’s latest update lets you send links to friends |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/5/15923834/snapchat-link-sending-update-paperclip-voice-filters-backdrops |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=July 5, 2017 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Filters, lenses, and stickers ====
Snaps can be personalized with various forms of visual effects and [[Sticker (messaging)|stickers]].  Geofilters are graphical overlays available if the user is [[Geo-fence|within a certain geographical location]], such as a city, event, or destination.&lt;ref name="tc-sponsoredfilters"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Darrell |last=Etherington |title=Snapchat Adds Geofilters For Quick Image Location Tags, And A New Revenue Possibility |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/15/snapchat-adds-geofilters-for-quick-image-location-tags-and-a-new-revenue-possibility/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=July 15, 2014 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar feature known as Geostickers was launched in 10 major cities in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Mannes |title=Snapchat lets the people have Geostickers |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/02/snapchat-lets-the-people-have-geostickers/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=August 2, 2016 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bitstrips|Bitmoji]] are stickers featuring personalized cartoon [[avatar (computing)|avatars]], which can be used in snaps and messaging.&lt;ref name="gandm-bitstripsacquired"&gt;{{cite web|title=Snapchat builds Bitmojis into app, confirms acquisition of Toronto startup|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/tech-news/snapchat-builds-bitmojis-into-app-confirms-acquisition/article30975847/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Here’s How You Can Use Bitmoji Inside Snapchat|url=http://fortune.com/2016/07/19/snapchat-bitmoji-integration/|website=Fortune|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bitmoji characters can also be used as World Lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/14/16303504/snapchat-bitmoji-world-lenses-animation-gabsee|title=Snapchat's Bitmoji avatars are now three-dimensional and animated|work=The Verge|access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Lens" feature, introduced in September 2015, allows users to add real-time effects into their snaps by using [[face detection]] technology. This is activated by long-pressing on a face within the viewfinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/technology/new-snapchat-selfie-lenses/|title=How to use Snapchat's new selfie Lenses|website=The Daily Dot|access-date=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, Snapchat extended this feature into "World Lenses", which use [[augmented reality]] technology to integrate [[3D computer graphics|3D rendered]] elements (such as objects and animated characters) into scenes; these elements are placed and anchored in [[3D space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Snapchat adds world lenses to further its push into augmented reality |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15333130/snapchat-world-lenses-something-new-for-facebook-to-copy |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=April 18, 2017 |accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Darrell |last=Etherington |title=Snapchat introduces World Lenses – live filters for just about anything |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/18/snapchat-introduces-world-lenses-live-filters-for-just-about-anything/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[Oath Inc.]] |date=April 18, 2017 |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2018 at [[TwitchCon]], Snap launched the Snap Camera desktop application for macOS and Windows PCs, which enables use of Snapchat lenses in video chat and live streaming services such as [[Skype]], [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]], [[YouTube]], and [[Zoom Video Communications|Zoom]]. Snapchat also launched integration with Twitch, including an in-stream [[Software widget|widget]] for Snapcodes, the ability to offer lenses to stream viewers and as an incentive to channel subscribers. Several video game-themed lenses were also launched at this time, including ones themed around ''[[League of Legends]]'', ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', and ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/26/twitch-snap-camera-snapchat-augmented-reality-filters/|title=Twitch streamers are getting Snap's AR selfie filters|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/26/18026688/snap-camera-snapchat-lenses-twitch-youtube-skype|title=Snapchat brings its camera to the desktop to add filters to your streaming videos|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stories and Discover ===
In October 2013, Snapchat introduced the "My Story" feature, which allows users to compile snaps into chronological storylines, accessible to all of their friends.&lt;ref name="tc-stories"&gt;{{cite web |first=Darrell |last=Etherington |title=Snapchat Gets Its Own Timeline With Snapchat Stories, 24-Hour Photo &amp; Video Tales |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/03/snapchat-gets-its-own-timeline-with-snapchat-stories-24-hour-photo-video-tales/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 3, 2013 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ellis |last=Hamburger |title=Snapchat's next big thing: 'Stories' that don't just disappear |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/3/4791934/snapchats-next-big-thing-stories-that-dont-just-disappear |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=October 3, 2013 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 2014, photo and video snaps presented to friends in the Stories functionality had surpassed person-to-person private snaps as the most frequently-used function of the service, with over one billion viewed per day — double the daily views tallied in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ellis |last=Hamburger |title=Surprise: Snapchat's most popular feature isn't snaps anymore |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/20/5827666/snapchat-stories-bigger-than-snaps-electric-daisy-carnival |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 20, 2014 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the story feature was expanded to incorporate "Our Stories", which was then changed to "Live Stories" about a year later. The feature allows users on-location at specific events (such as [[music festival]]s or sporting events) to contribute snaps to a curated story advertised to all users, showcasing a single event from multiple perspectives and viewpoints. These curated snaps provided by the app's contributors and selected for the "Live" section could also be more localized, but Snapchat eventually scaled back the more personal imaging streams in order to emphasize public events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Carl |last=Franzen |title=Snapchat lets you watch and create group videos of live events with 'Our Story' |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/29/6084221/snapchat-our-story-collective-snaps-from-live-events |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=August 29, 2014 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.snapchat.com/post/89064817345/introducing-our-story|title=Snapchat – Introducing Our Story|work=Snapchat Blog|accessdate=May 16, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522175232/http://blog.snapchat.com/post/89064817345/introducing-our-story|archivedate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/technology/snapchat-new-years-times-square/|title=Your Snapchat photo could wind up in Times Square tonight|work=The Daily Dot|accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="recode-storiesmoney"&gt;{{cite web |first=Kurt |last=Wagner |title=Snapchat Is Making Some Pretty Serious Money From Live Stories |url=https://www.recode.net/2015/6/17/11563634/snapchats-making-some-pretty-serious-money-from-live-stories |website=[[Recode]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 17, 2015 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=P.

An "Official Stories" designation was added in November 2015 to denote the public stories of notable figures and celebrities, similar to [[Twitter]]'s "Verified account" program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Snapchat rolls out 'official stories' to verify celebrity accounts |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/13/9731440/snapchat-verified-accounts |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 13, 2015 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Snapchat introduced "Discover", an area containing channels of ad-supported short-form content from major publishers, including [[BuzzFeed]], [[CNN]], [[ESPN]], [[Mashable]], [[People (magazine)|''People'']], [[Vice Media|Vice]] and [[Good Luck America|Snapchat]] itself among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=P.

When activated, the feature prevents the automatic downloading of snaps until they are explicitly requested by the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sam |last=Sheffer |title=Snapchat has a new feature to stop you from wasting data |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/10/9126923/snapchat-data-usage-update-travel-mode-emoji-snapcode |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=August 10, 2015 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, the app was updated to replace its auto-advance functionality, which automatically moved users from one story to the next, with a "Story Playlist" feature, letting users select thumbnails of users in the list to play only selected stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Snapchat launches post-roll ads, Story Playlist that loads favorites in bulk |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/07/snapchat-story-playlist/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 7, 2016 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Marty |last=Swant |title=Snapchat Is Ditching Auto Advance Stories in Favor of Playlists |url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/snapchat-ditching-auto-advance-stories-favor-playlists-173964/ |website=[[Adweek]] |publisher=Beringer Capital |date=October 7, 2016 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Snapchat revamped its design, adding search functionality and a new global live "Our Story" feature, to which any user can contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Karissa |last=Bell |title=This is not a drill: Snapchat is about to get a major redesign |url=http://mashable.com/2017/01/12/snapchat-redesign-search-bar/ |website=[[Mashable]] |date=January 13, 2017 |accessdate=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Snapchat introduced "Custom Stories", letting users collaboratively make stories combining their captures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Snapchat introduces custom stories for capturing group moments with friends |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/23/15677712/snapchat-custom-stories-launch |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=May 23, 2017 |accessdate=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Darrell |last=Etherington |title=Snapchat now lets you create custom stories for groups of friends and family |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/23/snapchat-now-lets-you-create-custom-stories-for-groups-of-friends-and-family/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=May 23, 2017 |accessdate=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, "Snap Map" was introduced, which allows users to optionally share their location with friends. A map display, accessible from the viewfinder, can be used to locate stories based on location data, supporting the use of Bitmoji as place markers. Entering a "Ghost Mode" hides the user from the map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Snapchat launches location-sharing feature Snap Map |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/snap-map/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 21, 2017 |accessdate=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Welch |title=Snapchat’s new Snap Map lets you share your location with friends |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/21/15846358/snapchat-snap-map-location-sharing-feature-announced |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 21, 2017 |accessdate=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The function is based on the app Zenly, which was acquired by Snap Inc. prior to its launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Snapchat acquires social map app Zenly for $250M to $350M |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/snapchat-buys-zenly/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 21, 2017 |accessdate=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The map data is supplied from [[OpenStreetMap]] and [[Mapbox]], while satellite imagery comes from [[DigitalGlobe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://streetfightmag.com/2017/07/10/snapchat-expands-its-foray-into-local-with-snap-map/ |title=Snapchat Expands Its Foray Into Local with Snap Map |author=Rollison, Damian |work=Street Fight |date=July 10, 2017 |accessdate=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Original video content ====
''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported in May 2017 that [[Snap Inc.]], the company developing Snapchat, had signed deals with [[NBCUniversal]], [[A&amp;E Networks]], [[BBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[Metro–Goldwyn–Mayer]] and other content producers to develop original shows for viewing through Snapchat's "Stories" format. According to the report, Snap hopes to have several new shows available on a daily basis, with each show lasting between three and five minutes, and the company has sent out detailed reports to its partners on how to produce content for Snapchat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Shalini |last=Ramachandran |title=Media Companies Line Up to Make Shows for Snap TV |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/media-companies-line-up-to-make-shows-for-snap-tv-1493890205 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] |date=May 4, 2017 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roger |last=Fingas |title=Snap signs major network deals for Snapchat TV shows |url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/05/04/snap-signs-major-network-deals-for-snapchat-tv-shows |website=AppleInsider |date=May 4, 2017 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mitchel |last=Broussard |title=Snapchat Plans Original TV Shows Lasting 3-5 Minutes Each, Partners Include ABC, HGTV, and More |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/04/snapchat-original-tv-shows/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=May 4, 2017 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Messaging ===
[[File:Snap on smartphone.jpg|thumb|right|Example Snapchat "snap" on a smartphone.]]
In contrast to other messaging apps, Spiegel described Snapchat's messaging functions as being "conversational," rather than "transactional," as they sought to replicate the conversations he engaged in with friends. Spiegel stated that he did not experience conversational interactions while using the products of competitors like [[iMessage]].&lt;ref name="verge-snapchatchat" /&gt;

Rather than a traditional online notification, a blue pulsing "Here" button is displayed within the sender's chat window if the recipient is currently viewing their own chat window. When this button is held down, a video chat function is immediately launched.&lt;ref name="verge-snapchatchat" /&gt;  By default, messages disappear after they are read, and a notification is sent to the recipient only when they start to type.&lt;ref name="verge-snapchatchat" /&gt; Users can also use messages to reply to snaps that are part of a story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Snapchat introduces a 'lens store' to adorn your selfies with 99-cent filters |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/13/9700312/snapchat-lens-store |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 13, 2015 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video chat feature uses technology from AddLive—a real-time communications provider that Snapchat acquired prior to the feature's launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ellis |last=Hamburger |title=Snapchat made a secret acquisition to power its new video chat |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/2/5676196/snapchat-acquires-addlive-video-chat |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the "Here" indicator, Spiegel explained that "the accepted notion of an online indicator that every chat service has is really a negative indicator. It means 'my friend is available and doesn't want to talk to you,' versus this idea in Snapchat where 'my friend is here and is giving you their full attention.'" Spiegel further claimed that the Here video function prevents the awkwardness that can arise from apps that use typing indicators because, with text communication, conversations lose their fluidity as each user tries to avoid typing at the same time.&lt;ref name="verge-snapchatchat"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ellis |last=Hamburger |title=Real talk: the new Snapchat brilliantly mixes video and texting |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/1/5670260/real-talk-the-new-snapchat-makes-texting-fun-again-video-calls |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=May 1, 2014 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, 2016, Snapchat launched a major revision of the messaging functionality known as "Chat 2.0", adding stickers, easier access to audio and video conferencing, the ability to leave audio or video "notes", and the ability to share recent camera photos. The implementation of these features are meant to allow users to easily shift between text, audio, and video chat as needed while retaining an equal level of functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Snapchat redesigns chat to add stickers, audio, and video notes |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/29/11321150/snapchat-chat-redesign-stickers-audio-video-notes |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=March 29, 2016 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, Snapchat added the feature of deleting a sent message (including; audio, video, and text) before it is read.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/11/17449906/snapchat-delete-unopened-sent-messages-spectacles-amazon|title=Snapchat now lets you delete unopened sent messages|work=The Verge|access-date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://9to5mac.com/2018/06/11/snapchat-delete-sent-messages-spectacles-amazon/|title=Snapchat update lets you delete sent messages, Spectacles hit Amazon․com|date=June 11, 2018|work=9to5Mac|access-date=June 12, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature introduced in August 2018, allows users to send Musical GIFs, TuneMojis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-musical-gifs-tunemoji-2018-8|title=You can now send musical GIFs to Snapchat|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/snapchat-tunemoji-music-gifs-a3918361.html|title=You can now send music GIFs in Snapchat with TuneMoji|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business and multimedia ==
===Demographics===
From its earliest days, Snapchat's main demographic has consisted of [[millennials]].&lt;ref name="digiday-demographics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digiday.com/platforms/snapchat-pitching-brands-agencies/|title=Pitch deck: How Snapchat is selling itself to marketers – Digiday|work=[[Digiday]]|accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, researchers from the [[University of Washington]] and [[Seattle Pacific University]] designed a user survey to help understand how and why the application was being used. The researchers originally hypothesized that due to the ephemeral nature of Snapchat messages, its use would be predominantly for privacy-sensitive content including the much talked about potential use for sexual content and [[sexting]].&lt;ref name="Roesner"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roesner| first1=Franziska|first2=Brian T|last2=Gill|first3=Tadayoshi|last3=Kohno |title=Sex, Lies, or Kittens? Investigating the Use of Snapchat's Self-Destructing Messages|work=Financial Cryptography and Data Security Conference|date=2014|format=pdf|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-45472-5_5|url=https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yoshi/papers/snapchat-FC2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it appears that Snapchat is used for a variety of creative purposes that are not necessarily privacy-related at all.&lt;ref name="Roesner" /&gt;  In the study, only 1.6% of respondents reported using Snapchat primarily for sexting, although 14.2% admitted to having sent sexual content via Snapchat at some point.&lt;ref name="Roesner" /&gt;  These findings suggest that users do not seem to utilize Snapchat for sensitive content.  Rather, the primary use for Snapchat was found to be for comedic content such as "stupid faces" with 59.8% of respondents reporting this use most commonly.&lt;ref name="Roesner" /&gt; The researchers also determined how Snapchat users do not use the application and what types of content they are not willing to send. They found that the majority of users are not willing to send content classified as sexting (74.8% of respondents), photos of documents (85.0% of respondents), messages containing legally questionable content (86.6% of respondents), or content considered mean or insulting (93.7% of respondents).&lt;ref name="Roesner" /&gt;

The study results also suggested that Snapchat's success is not due to its security properties, but because the users found the application to be fun. The researchers found that users seem to be well aware (79.4% of respondents) that recovering snaps is possible and a majority of users (52.8% of respondents) report that this does not affect their behavior and use of Snapchat.&lt;ref name="Roesner" /&gt; Many users (52.8% of respondents) were found to use an arbitrary timeout length on snaps regardless of the content type or recipient. The remaining respondents were found to adjust their snaps' timeout depending on the content or the recipient.&lt;ref name="Roesner" /&gt; Reasons for adjusting the time length of snaps included the level of trust and relationship with the recipient, the time needed to comprehend the snap, and avoiding [[screenshot]]s.&lt;ref name="Roesner" /&gt;

===Communication===
Snapchat has often been seen to represent a new direction in social media, with its users, particularly millennials, craving a more in-the-moment way of sharing and communicating via technology. With less emphasis on the accumulation of an ongoing status involving the presence of permanent material, Snapchat put focus on the ephemeral nature of fleeting encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Casey Johnston, [http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/snapchat-instagram-stories-and-the-internet-of-forgetting "Snachat, Instagram Stories, And The Internet Of Forgetting"], ''TheNewYorker'', August 5, 2016. Retrieved August 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
Building on this distinction by launching as a mobile-first company, Snapchat, in the midst of the app revolution and the growing presence of cellular communication, didn't have to make the transition to mobile in the way other competing social media networks had to do. Evan Spiegel himself described Snapchat as primarily a camera company.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Basche,      [https://medium.freecodecamp.com/ghost-in-the-machine-snapchat-isnt-mobile-first-it-s-something-else-entirely-4f6c265152a2#.sqvrq1k2w "Ghost in the machine: Snapchat isn’t mobile-first — it’s something else entirely"], ''ibtimes.com'', July 28, 2016.

Retrieved August 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the growing mobile app moved to offer distinct publication, media, and news content within its Discover channel, as well as with its overall style of presentation. With Snapchat, a clear and identifiable line was drawn between brand content and user-based messaging and sharing, once again distinguishing the popular app from other social media networks, which typically have blended and blurred their different varieties of content.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hussey, [https://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/05/04/story-snapchats-confusing-discover-feed/ "Snapchat’s Discover channel is quietly ruining the social network"], ''thenextweb.com'', May 8, 2016. Retrieved August 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monetization===
Snapchat's developing features embody a deliberate strategy of [[monetization]].

Snapchat announced its then-upcoming advertising efforts on October 17, 2014, when it acknowledged its need for a revenue stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Garett |last=Sloane |title=Snapchat Says Ads Are Coming This Weekend: ‘We Need the Money’ |url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/snapchat-says-ads-are-coming-weekend-we-need-money-160857/ |website=[[Adweek]] |publisher=Beringer Capital |date=October 17, 2014 |accessdate=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company stated that it wanted to evaluate "if we can deliver an experience that's fun and informative, the way ads used to be, before they got creepy and targeted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Stuart |last=Dredge |title=Snapchat messaging app gets its first ad... and it's very creepy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=October 20, 2014 |accessdate=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snapchat's first paid advertisement, in the form of a 20-second movie trailer for the horror film ''[[Ouija (2014 film)|Ouija]]'', was shown to users on October 19, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Karissa |last=Bell |title=Snapchat Freaks Out Users With First Ad for 'Ouija' |url=http://mashable.com/2014/10/18/snapchat-ouija-ad/ |website=[[Mashable]] |date=October 19, 2014 |accessdate=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Marc |last=Graser |title=Snapchat Scares Up Advertising Business with ‘Ouija’ |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/snapchat-scares-up-advertising-business-with-ouija-1201334130/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |date=October 19, 2014 |accessdate=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Snapchat began making a shift from focusing on growth to monetization. The company launched its "Discover" feature, which allowed for paid advertising by presenting short-form content from publishers. Its initial launch partners included CNN, Comedy Central, ESPN and Food Network, among others.&lt;ref name="Chowdhry 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alyson |last=Shontell |title=Advertisers are supposedly paying insanely high rates to get their ads on Snapchat |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-discover-ad-rates-2015-3 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=March 12, 2015 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, Snapchat announced that it would allow advertisers to purchase sponsored geofilters for snaps; an early customer of the offering was [[McDonald's]], who paid for a branded geofilter covering its restaurant locations in the United States.&lt;ref name="tc-sponsoredfilters"&gt;{{cite web |first=Fitz |last=Tepper |title=Snapchat Turns Geofilters Into An Ad Unit |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/16/snapchat-begins-charging-for-sponsored-geofilters/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 16, 2015 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snapchat made a push to earn ad revenue from its "Live Stories" feature in 2015, after initially launching the feature in 2014. Ad placements can be sold within a live story, or a story can be pitched by a sponsor. Live stories are estimated to reach an average of 20 million viewers in a 24-hour span.&lt;ref name="recode-storiesmoney" /&gt; In September 2015, the service entered into a partnership with the [[National Football League]] to present live stories from selected games (including a Sunday game, and marquee games such as [[Monday Night Football]] and [[Thursday Night Football]]), with both parties contributing content and handling ad sales.&lt;ref name="recode-storiesmoney" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2015/9/17/11618660/snapchat-inks-nfl-deal-to-bring-football-into-its-live-stories|title=Snapchat Inks NFL Deal to Bring Football Into Its Live Stories|last=Wagner|first=Kurt|date=September 17, 2015|website=[[Recode]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 Internet Trends Report by Mary Meeker highlighted the significant growth of [[vertical video]] viewing. Vertical video ads like Snapchat's are watched in their entirety nine times more than landscape video ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kleinerperkins.com/perspectives/2015-internet-trends|title=2015 Internet Trends|website=Kleiner Perkins|language=en|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, [[NBC Olympics]] announced that it had reached a deal with Snapchat to allow stories from the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] to be featured on Snapchat in the United States. The content would include a behind-the-scenes Discover channel curated by [[BuzzFeed]] (a company which [[NBCUniversal]] has funded), and stories featuring a combination of footage from NBC, athletes, and attendees. NBC will sell advertising and enter into revenue sharing agreements. This marked the first time NBC allowed Olympics footage to be featured on third-party property.&lt;ref name="bloomberg-nbcriosc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-29/snapchat-scores-unprecedented-deal-with-nbc-to-showcase-olympics|title=Snapchat Scores Unique Deal With NBC to Showcase Olympics|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, as part of a campaign to promote ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', [[20th Century Fox]] paid for the entire array of lenses to be replaced by those based on characters from the ''[[X-Men]]'' series and films for a single day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lauren |last=Johnson |title=20th Century Fox Buys First Snapchat Lens Takeover Ad |url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/twentieth-century-fox-buys-first-snapchat-lens-takeover-ad-171639/ |website=[[Adweek]] |publisher=Beringer Capital |date=May 23, 2016 |accessdate=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, it was reported that Snapchat had submitted a [[patent]] application for the process of using an object recognition system to deliver sponsored filters based on objects seen in a camera view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Vincent |title=Snapchat applies for patent to serve ads by recognizing objects in your snaps |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/18/12211292/snapchat-object-recognition-advertising |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=July 18, 2016 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, in Sep 2016, Snapchat released its first hardware product, called the Spectacles. Evan Spiegel, CEO of [[Snap Inc.]], called it “a toy” but saw it as an upside to freeing his app from smartphone cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://latestgadgets.tech/2016/09/24/snapchat-launches-camera-sunglasses/|title=Snapchat launches camera sunglasses, and they're very expensive • Latest Gadgets|date=September 24, 2016|work=Latest Gadgets|access-date=June 13, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital marketing==
{{tone|section}}
Snapchat is one of the top social networks that digital marketers are paying attention to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Snapchat's place in the marketing mix?|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/03/02/what-snapchats-place-the-marketing-mix|website=THEDRUM|publisher=Rebecca Stewart|accessdate=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleetingness and temporality of Snapchat  are its most attractive features in [[digital marketing]]. The feature is in conformity with [[real-time marketing]] and Snapchat makes good use of the real-time attention to this feature. It can help companies grasp the hot spots in promoting publicity so that it attracts the attention of the users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Snapchat is the next big thing in digital marketing|url=https://www.cio.com/article/3043043/marketing/why-snapchat-is-the-next-big-thing-in-digital-marketing.html|website=CIO|publisher=Matt Kapko|accessdate=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other social networks, the subject of Snapchat is video-based. Therefore, comparing to text, an interesting and creative video can leave a vivid memory in the audience. At the same time, "Live Stories" allows users to upload videos on specific activities and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surprise: Snapchat's most popular feature isn't snaps anymore|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/20/5827666/snapchat-stories-bigger-than-snaps-electric-daisy-carnival|website=THE VERGE|publisher=Ellis Hamburger|accessdate=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, multi-angle videos show more perspectives and meet the needs of the users. On the other hand, it appeals to more people to use Snapchat and join the events. In term of the marketing process, Snapchat plays the role of attracting attention, inducing interest and stimulating purchase desire for the customers. In other words, Snapchat plays an important role in digital marketing in combination with the [[AIDA (marketing)]] model and modern digital technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attention, Interest, Desire, Action: Using AIDA for Social Media|url=http://www.marketingprofs.com/opinions/2015/27431/attention-interest-desire-action-using-aida-for-social-media|website=MarketingProfs|publisher=Sarah Green|accessdate=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comprised some examples:

=== Federal Trade Commission ===
In 2014, Snapchat settled a complaint made by the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. The government agency alleged that the company had exaggerated to the public the degree to which mobile app images and photos could actually be made to disappear. Under the terms of the agreement, Snapchat was not fined, but the app service agreed to have its claims and policies monitored by an independent party for a period of 20 years. The FTC concluded that Snapchat was prohibited from "misrepresenting the extent to which it maintains the privacy, security, or confidentiality of users' information."&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Peterson, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/05/08/snapchat-agrees-to-settle-ftc-charges-that-it-deceived-users/ "Snapchat agrees to settle FTC charges that it deceived users"], ''The Washington Post'', May 8, 2014. Retrieved August 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the agreement, Snapchat updated its privacy page to state that the company "can't guarantee that messages will be deleted within a specific timeframe." &lt;ref name="snapchatprivacy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Snapchat Privacy Policy|url=http://www.snapchat.com/privacy|accessdate=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after Snapchat deletes message data from their servers, that same data may remain in backup for a certain period of time.&lt;ref name="snapchatprivacy" /&gt; In a public blog post, the service warned that "If you've ever tried to recover lost data after accidentally deleting a drive or maybe watched an episode of ''[[CSI (TV series)|CSI]]'', you might know that with the right forensic tools, it's sometimes possible to retrieve data after it has been deleted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Snaps Are Stored And Deleted|url=http://blog.snapchat.com/post/50060403002/how-snaps-are-stored-and-deleted|work=Snapchat Blog|publisher=Snapchat|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=May 9, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708202131/http://blog.snapchat.com/post/50060403002/how-snaps-are-stored-and-deleted|archivedate=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lens incidents===
In September 2015, an 18-year-old was using a Snapchat feature called "Lens" to record the speed she was driving her Mercedes C230 when she crashed into a Mitsubishi Outlander in Hampton, Georgia.  The {{convert|107|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} crash injured both drivers. The driver of the Outlander spent five weeks in [[intensive care]] while he was treated for severe [[traumatic brain injury]].  In April 2016, the Outlander driver sued both Snapchat and the user of Snapchat, alleging that Snapchat knew its application was being used in unlawful speed contests, yet did nothing to prevent such use so is negligent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Snapchat at 107 M.P.H.?

==="Poor Country" remark===
According to former Snapchat employee Anthony Pompliano in a lawsuit filed against Snap Inc.,&amp;nbsp;Spiegel made a statement in 2015 that Snapchat is "only for rich people" and that he does not "want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gene |last=Maddaus |title=Snapchat CEO Said ‘This App Is Only for Rich People,’ Ex-Employee Alleges |url=https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/snapchat-evan-spiegel-only-for-rich-people-anthony-pompliano-1202028526/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |date=April 11, 2017 |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident sparked a [[Twitter#Trending topics|Twitter trend]] called "#UninstallSnapchat", in which Indian users uninstalled the app,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Emma |last=Hinchcliffe |title=#UninstallSnapchat is taking off in India after an allegedly terrible comment from Snap's CEO |url=http://mashable.com/2017/04/15/uninstall-snapchat-india/ |website=[[Mashable]] |date=April 15, 2017 |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and caused backlash against the company in terms of low "one-star" ratings for the app in the [[Google Play]] store and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Snapchat's App Rating Takes A Massive Hit On Play Store Thanks To 'Poor Indians', Spokesperson Issues Clarification |url=http://www.indiatimes.com/technology/apps/snapchat-s-app-rating-takes-a-massive-hit-on-play-store-thanks-to-poor-indians-spokesperson-issues-clarification-275743.html |website=[[The Times of India]] |publisher=[[The Times Group]] |date=April 16, 2017 |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-star"/&gt; Snapchat's shares fell by 1.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Noel |last1=Randewich |first2=David |last2=Ingram |title=Snap stock falls as alleged CEO comments rile some on social media |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-snap-stocks-idUSKBN17J1I5 |website=[[Reuters]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |date=April 17, 2017 |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the allegation, Snapchat called Pompliano's claim "ridiculous", and elaborated that "Obviously Snapchat is for everyone.

==="Snap Map" privacy concerns===
The June 2017 release of "Snap Map", a feature that broadcasts the user's location on a map, was met with concerns over privacy and safety. The feature, though an opt-in, delivers a message asking if the user would like to show their position on the map, but reportedly doesn't explain the ramifications of doing so, including that the app updates the user's position on the map each time the app is opened and not just when actively capturing snaps, potentially allowing for stalkers. The map can be zoomed in to feature detailed geographical information, such as street addresses.&lt;ref name="verge-snap-map"&gt;{{cite web |first=Dani |last=Deahl |title=Snapchat’s newest feature is also its biggest privacy threat |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/23/15864552/snapchat-snap-map-privacy-threat |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 23, 2017 |accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that police forces had issued child safety warnings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Field |title=Police issue child safety warning over Snapchat maps update that reveals users' locations |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/06/23/police-issue-child-safety-warning-snapchat-maps-update-reveals/ |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=June 23, 2017 |accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other media publications wrote that safety concerns were also raised for teenagers and adults unaware of the feature's actual behavior.&lt;ref name="verge-snap-map" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Olivia |last=Salon |title=Snapchat's new map feature raises fears of stalking and bullying |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/23/snapchat-maps-privacy-safety-concerns |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=June 23, 2017 |accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement to ''[[The Verge]]'', a Snapchat spokesperson said that "The safety of our community is very important to us and we want to make sure that all Snapchatters, parents, and educators have accurate information about how the Snap Map works".&lt;ref name="verge-snap-map" /&gt;
Users have the ability to operate in "Ghost Mode", or select the friends that they wish to share their location with. Although there has been an increase in advertising on Snapchat, Snapchat has stated that they do not plan on running ads on Snap Map stories.

===2018 redesign===
In November 2017, Snapchat announced a redesign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Team Snap|title=Introducing the new Snapchat|url=https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/introducing-the-new-snapchat/|website=snap.com|date=November 29, 2017|accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proved controversial with many of its followers. [[CNBC]]'s Ingrid Angulo listed some of the reasons why many disliked the update, citing that sending a snap and re-watching stories was more complicated, stories and incoming snaps were now listed on the same page, and that the Discover page now included featured and sponsored content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ingrid|first1=Angulo|title=Here's Why Snapchat Users Are so Upset about Its Recent Redesign|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/12/why-the-snapchat-redesign-is-so-bad.html|website=CNBC|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, [[Kylie Jenner]] sent a tweet criticizing the redesign of the Snapchat app.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|user=KylieJenner|number=966429897118728192|date=February 21, 2018|title=sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore?

[[Image:Superscalarpipeline.svg|thumb|300px|right|Simple superscalar pipeline. By fetching and dispatching two instructions at a time, a maximum of two instructions per cycle can be completed. (IF = Instruction Fetch, ID = Instruction Decode, EX = Execute, MEM = Memory access, WB = Register write back, ''i'' = Instruction number, ''t'' = Clock cycle [i.e., time])]]

[[Image:Processor board cray-2 hg.jpg|thumb|Processor board of a [[Cray T3E|CRAY T3e]] supercomputer with four ''superscalar'' [[Alpha 21164]] processors]]

A '''superscalar processor''' is a [[Central processing unit|CPU]] that implements a form of [[Parallel computer|parallelism]] called [[instruction-level parallelism]] within a single processor. In contrast to a [[scalar processor]] that can execute at most one single instruction per clock cycle, a superscalar processor can execute more than one instruction during a clock cycle by simultaneously dispatching multiple instructions to different [[execution unit]]s on the processor. It therefore allows for more [[throughput]] (the number of instructions that can be executed in a unit of time) than would otherwise be possible at a given [[clock rate]]. Each execution unit is not a separate processor (or a core if the processor is a [[multi-core processor]]), but an execution resource within a single CPU such as an [[arithmetic logic unit]].

In [[Flynn's taxonomy]], a single-core superscalar processor is classified as an [[SISD]] processor (Single Instruction stream, Single Data stream), though many superscalar processors support short vector operations and so could be classified as [[SIMD]] (Single Instruction stream, Multiple Data streams). A [[multi-core]] superscalar processor is classified as an [[MIMD]] processor (Multiple Instruction streams, Multiple Data streams).

While a superscalar CPU is typically also [[instruction pipeline|pipeline]]d, superscalar and pipelining execution are considered different performance enhancement techniques. The former executes multiple instructions in parallel by using multiple execution units, whereas the latter executes multiple instructions in the same execution unit in parallel by dividing the execution unit into different phases.

The superscalar technique is traditionally associated with several identifying characteristics (within a given CPU):
* Instructions are issued from a sequential instruction stream
* The CPU dynamically checks for [[data dependencies]] between instructions at run time (versus software checking at [[compile time]])
* The CPU can execute multiple instructions per clock cycle

==History==
[[Seymour Cray]]'s [[CDC 6600]] from 1966 is often mentioned as the first superscalar design. The 1967 [[IBM System/360 Model 91]] was another superscalar mainframe. The Motorola [[MC88100]] (1988), the [[Intel i960]]CA (1989) and the [[AMD 29000]]-series 29050 (1990) microprocessors were the first commercial single-chip superscalar microprocessors. [[RISC]] microprocessors like these were the first to have superscalar execution, because RISC architectures frees transistors and die area which could be used to include multiple execution units (this was why RISC designs were faster than [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] designs through the 1980s and into the 1990s).

Except for CPUs used in [[Low-power electronics|low-power]] applications, [[embedded system]]s, and [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered devices, essentially all general-purpose CPUs developed since about 1998 are superscalar.

The [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] was the first superscalar x86 processor; the [[Nx586]], [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]] [[Pentium Pro]] and [[AMD K5]] were among the first designs which decode [[x86]]-instructions asynchronously into dynamic [[microcode]]-like ''[[micro-op]]'' sequences prior to actual execution on a superscalar [[microarchitecture]]; this opened up for dynamic scheduling of buffered ''partial'' instructions and enabled more parallelism to be extracted compared to the more rigid methods used in the simpler [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]]; it also simplified [[speculative execution]] and allowed higher clock frequencies compared to designs such as the advanced [[Cyrix 6x86]].

==Scalar to superscalar==
The simplest processors are [[scalar processor]]s. Each instruction executed by a scalar processor typically manipulates one or two data items at a time. By contrast, each instruction executed by a [[vector processor]] operates simultaneously on many data items. An analogy is the difference between [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] and vector arithmetic. A superscalar processor is a mixture of the two. Each instruction processes one data item, but there are multiple execution units within each CPU thus multiple instructions can be processing separate data items concurrently.

Superscalar CPU design emphasizes improving the instruction dispatcher accuracy, and allowing it to keep the multiple execution units in use at all times. This has become increasingly important as the number of units has increased. While early superscalar CPUs would have two [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]]s and a single [[floating point unit|FPU]], a modern design such as the [[PowerPC 970]] includes four ALUs, two FPUs, and two [[SIMD]] units. If the dispatcher is ineffective at keeping all of these units fed with instructions, the performance of the system will be no better than that of a simpler, cheaper design.

A superscalar processor usually sustains an execution rate in excess of one [[Cycles per instruction|instruction per machine cycle]]. But merely processing multiple instructions concurrently does not make an architecture superscalar, since [[Instruction pipeline|pipelined]], [[multiprocessor]] or [[Multi-core (computing)|multi-core]] architectures also achieve that, but with different methods.

In a superscalar CPU the dispatcher reads instructions from memory and decides which ones can be run in parallel, dispatching each to one of the several execution units contained inside a single CPU. Therefore, a superscalar processor can be envisioned having multiple parallel pipelines, each of which is processing instructions simultaneously from a single instruction thread.

==Limitations==
Available performance improvement from superscalar techniques is limited by three key areas:
# The degree of intrinsic parallelism in the instruction stream (instructions requiring the same computational resources from the CPU).
# The complexity and time cost of dependency checking logic and [[register renaming]] circuitry
# The branch instruction processing.

Existing binary executable programs have varying degrees of intrinsic parallelism. In some cases instructions are not dependent on each other and can be executed simultaneously. In other cases they are inter-dependent: one instruction impacts either resources or results of the other. The instructions &lt;code&gt;a = b + c; d = e + f&lt;/code&gt; can be run in parallel because none of the results depend on other calculations. However, the instructions &lt;code&gt;a = b + c; b = e + f&lt;/code&gt; might not be runnable in parallel, depending on the order in which the instructions complete while they move through the units.

When the number of simultaneously issued instructions increases, the cost of dependency checking increases extremely rapidly. This is exacerbated by the need to check dependencies at run time and at the CPU's clock rate. This cost includes additional logic gates required to implement the checks, and time delays through those gates. Research{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} shows the gate cost in some cases may be &lt;math&gt;n^k&lt;/math&gt; gates, and the delay cost &lt;math&gt;k^2 \log n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of instructions in the processor's instruction set, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the number of simultaneously dispatched instructions.

Even though the instruction stream may contain no inter-instruction dependencies, a superscalar CPU must nonetheless check for that possibility, since there is no assurance otherwise and failure to detect a dependency would produce incorrect results.

No matter how advanced the [[semiconductor device fabrication | semiconductor process]] or how fast the switching speed, this places a practical limit on how many instructions can be simultaneously dispatched. While process advances will allow ever greater numbers of execution units (e.g., ALUs), the burden of checking instruction dependencies grows rapidly, as does the complexity of register renaming circuitry to mitigate some dependencies. Collectively the [[CPU power dissipation | power consumption]], complexity and gate delay costs limit the achievable superscalar speedup to roughly eight simultaneously dispatched instructions.

However even given infinitely fast dependency checking logic on an otherwise conventional superscalar CPU, if the instruction stream itself has many dependencies, this would also limit the possible speedup. Thus the degree of intrinsic parallelism in the code stream forms a second limitation.

==Alternatives==
Collectively, these limits drive investigation into alternative architectural changes such as [[very long instruction word]] (VLIW), [[explicitly parallel instruction computing]] (EPIC), [[simultaneous multithreading]] (SMT), and [[Multi-core (computing)|multi-core computing]].

With VLIW, the burdensome task of dependency checking by [[hardware logic]] at run time is removed and delegated to the [[compiler]]. [[Explicitly parallel instruction computing]] (EPIC) is like VLIW, with extra cache prefetching instructions.

Simultaneous multithreading, often abbreviated as SMT, is a technique for improving the overall efficiency of superscalar processors. SMT permits multiple independent threads of execution to better utilize the resources provided by modern processor architectures.

Superscalar processors differ from [[multi-core processor]]s in that the several execution units are not entire processors. A single processor is composed of finer-grained execution units such as the [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]], [[Integer (computer science)|integer]] [[Binary multiplier|multiplier]], integer shifter, [[Floating-point unit|FPU]], etc. There may be multiple versions of each execution unit to enable execution of many instructions in parallel. This differs from a multi-core processor that concurrently processes instructions from ''multiple'' threads, one thread per [[Central processing unit|processing unit]] (called "core"). It also differs from a [[instruction pipelining|pipelined processor]], where the multiple instructions can concurrently be in various stages of execution, [[Assembly line|assembly-line]] fashion.

The various alternative techniques are not mutually exclusive—they can be (and frequently are) combined in a single processor. Thus a multicore CPU is possible where each core is an independent processor containing multiple parallel pipelines, each pipeline being superscalar. Some processors also include [[vector processor|vector]] capability.

[[Vegetable oil]] can be used as an [[alternative fuel]] in [[diesel engine]]s and in [[heating oil]] burners. When vegetable oil is used directly as a fuel, in either modified or unmodified equipment, it is referred to as '''straight vegetable oil''' (SVO) or '''pure plant oil''' (PPO). Conventional diesel engines can be modified to help ensure that the [[viscosity]] of the vegetable oil is low enough to allow proper [[Aerosol|atomization]] of the fuel. This prevents incomplete combustion, which would damage the engine by causing a build-up of [[carbon]]. Straight vegetable oil can also be blended with conventional diesel or processed into [[biodiesel]] or [[bioliquids]] for use under a wider range of conditions.

==History==
[[File:Rudolf Diesel.jpg|thumb|160px|Rudolf Diesel]]
[[Rudolf Diesel]] was the father of the engine which bears his name. His first attempts were to design an engine to run on coal dust, but later designed his engine to run on vegetable oil. The idea, he hoped, would make his engines more attractive to farmers having a source of fuel readily available. In a 1912 presentation to the British [[Institute of Mechanical Engineers]], he cited a number of efforts in this area and remarked, "The fact that fat oils from vegetable sources can be used may seem insignificant today, but such oils may perhaps become in course of time of the same importance as some natural mineral oils and the tar products are now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knothe|first=Gerhard|title=Historical Perspectives on Vegetable Oil-Based Diesel Fuels|journal=Inform|volume=12|issue=11|year=2001|format=PDF|pages=1103–1107|url=http://www.biodiesel.org/resources/reportsdatabase/reports/gen/20011101_gen-346.pdf|accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodic petroleum shortages spurred research into vegetable oil as a diesel substitute during the 1930s and 1940s, and again in the 1970s and early 1980s when straight vegetable oil enjoyed its highest level of scientific interest. The 1970s also saw the formation of the first commercial enterprise to allow consumers to run straight [[vegetable oil]] in their automobiles, [[Elsbett]] of [[Germany]]. In the 1990s [[Bougainville Civil War|Bougainville conflict]], islanders cut off from oil supplies due to a blockade used [[coconut oil]] to fuel their vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|title=The Coconut Revolution|id=0479000}} (2000) a documentary film&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application and usability==

=== Modified fuel systems ===
Most diesel car engines are suitable for the use of straight vegetable oil (SVO), also commonly called pure plant oil (PPO), with certain modifications. Principally, the [[viscosity]] and [[surface tension]] of the SVO/PPO must be reduced by preheating it, typically by using [[waste heat]] from the engine or electricity, otherwise poor atomization, incomplete combustion and [[carbonization]] may result. One common solution is to add a [[heat exchanger]] and an additional fuel tank for the petrodiesel or biodiesel blend and to switch between this additional tank and the main tank of SVO/PPO.  The engine is started on diesel, switched over to vegetable oil as soon as it is warmed up and switched back to diesel shortly before being switched off to ensure that no vegetable oil remains in the engine or fuel lines when it is started from cold again. In colder climates it is often necessary to heat the vegetable oil fuel lines and tank as it can become very viscous and even solidify.

Single tank conversions have been developed, largely in Germany, which have been used throughout Europe.  These conversions are designed to provide reliable operation with rapeseed oil that meets the German rapeseed oil fuel standard [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] 51605.  Modifications to the engines cold start regime assist combustion on start up and during the engine warm up phase.  Suitably modified [[indirect injection]] (IDI) engines have proven to be operable with 100% PPO down to temperatures of {{convert|−10|C|F}}.  [[fuel injection#Direct injection|Direct injection]] (DI) engines generally have to be preheated with a [[block heater]] or diesel fired heater.  The exception is the VW Tdi ([[Turbocharged Direct Injection]]) engine for which a number of German companies offer single tank conversions.  For long term durability it has been found necessary to increase the oil change frequency and to pay increased attention to engine maintenance.

=== Unmodified indirect injection engines ===
Many cars powered by [[indirect injection]] engines supplied by in-line injection pumps, or mechanical [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] injection pumps are capable of running on pure SVO/PPO in all but winter temperatures.  Indirect injection [[Mercedes-Benz]] vehicles with in-line injection pumps and cars featuring the [[PSA XUD]] engine tend to perform reasonably, especially as the latter is normally equipped with a coolant heated [[fuel filter]].  Engine reliability would depend on the condition of the engine. Attention to maintenance of the engine, particularly of the fuel injectors, cooling system and glow plugs will help to provide longevity.  Ideally the engine would be converted.&lt;ref name="geoscience1"/&gt;

=== Vegetable oil blending ===
The relatively high kinematic viscosity of vegetable oils must be reduced to make them compatible with conventional compression-ignition engines and fuel systems. [[Cosolvent]] blending is a low-cost and easy-to-adapt technology that reduces viscosity by diluting the vegetable oil with a low-molecular-weight [[solvent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/bitstream/10113/13863/1/IND23287385.pdf |title=Low-Temperature Flow Properties of Vegetable Oil/Cosolvent Blend Diesel Fuels |first=R. O. |last=Dunn |work=ddr.nal.usda.gov |year=2008 |accessdate=23 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814100833/http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/bitstream/10113/13863/1/IND23287385.pdf |archivedate=14 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This blending, or "cutting", has been done with diesel fuel, kerosene, and gasoline, amongst others; however, opinions vary as to the efficacy of this. Noted problems include higher rates of wear and failure in fuel pumps and piston rings when using blends.&lt;ref name="geoscience1"&gt;[https://archive.is/20070505112107/http://www.sopac.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Coconut+Oil+Fuel+Research+RMI Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission: "Coconut Oil Fuel Research in the Republic of the Marshall Islands"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Home heating ===
{{Main|Bioliquids}}
When liquid fuels made from biomass are used for energy purposes other than transport, they are called bioliquids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-e-a.net/document-library/articles/REAYearbook2009FINALVersion.pdf Renewable Energy Association 2009 Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724024758/http://www.r-e-a.net/document-library/articles/REAYearbook2009FINALVersion.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
With often minimal modification, most residential furnaces and boilers that are designed to burn No. 2 heating oil can be made to burn either biodiesel or filtered, preheated waste vegetable oil (WVO).  If cleaned at home by the consumer, WVO can result in considerable savings.  Many restaurants will receive a minimal amount for their used cooking oil, and processing to biodiesel is fairly simple and inexpensive.  Burning filtered WVO directly is somewhat more problematic, since it is much more viscous; nonetheless, its burning can be accomplished with suitable preheating.  WVO can thus be an economical heating option for those with the necessary mechanical and experimental aptitude.

==== Combined heat and power ====
A number of companies offer [[diesel engines|compressed ignition engine]] generators optimized to run on plant oils where the waste engine heat is recovered for heating.

==Properties==

The main form of SVO/PPO used in the UK is [[rapeseed]] oil (also known as [[canola]] oil, primarily in the United States and Canada) which has a freezing point of {{convert|−10|C|F}}.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} However the use of sunflower oil, which gels at around {{convert|−12|C|F}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Material compatibility===

Polymerization also has been consequentially linked to catastrophic component failures such as injection pump shaft seizure and breakage, injector tip failure leading to various and/or combustion chamber components damaged. Most metallurgical problems such as corrosion and electrolysis are related to water based contamination or poor choices of plumbing (such as copper or Zinc) which can cause gelling- even with petroleum based fuels.

===Temperature effects===

Some Pacific island nations are using [[coconut oil]] as fuel to reduce their expenses and their dependence on imported fuels while helping stabilize the coconut oil market. Coconut oil is only usable where temperatures do not drop below {{convert|17|C|F|abbr=off}}, unless two-tank SVO/PPO kits or other tank-heating accessories, etc. are used. The same techniques developed to use, for example, canola and other oils in cold climates can be implemented to make coconut oil usable in temperatures lower than {{convert|17|C|F|abbr=off}}

==Availability==
[[File:Rapsolja bus.jpg|thumb|Biodiesel bus in Sweden]]
===Recycled vegetable oil===
{{main|Yellow grease}}
Recycled vegetable oil, also termed used vegetable oil (UVO), waste vegetable oil (WVO), used cooking oil (UCO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/articles/186121/incbio-contracted-to-supply-2-4-mmgy-biodiesel-plant-to-greece|title=IncBio contracted to supply 2.4 MMgy biodiesel plant to Greece|last=Kotrba|first=Ron|date=September 23, 2014|work=Biodiesel Magazine|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[yellow grease]] (in [[commodities]] exchange), is recovered from businesses and industry that use the oil for cooking.

{{As of|2000}}, the [[United States]] was producing in excess of 11 billion liters (2.9 billion U.S. gallons) of recycled vegetable oil annually, mainly from industrial [[deep fryer]]s in [[potato]] processing plants, [[snack food]] factories and [[fast food restaurant]]s.  If all those 11 billion liters could be [[recycling|recycled]] and used to replace the energy equivalent amount of petroleum (an ideal case), almost 1% of US oil consumption could be offset.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States]]&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing recycled vegetable oil as a replacement for standard petroleum-derived fuels like gasoline would reduce the price of gasoline by preserving the supply of petroleum.

=== Virgin vegetable oil ===
Virgin vegetable oil, also termed pure plant oil or straight vegetable oil, is extracted from plants solely for use as fuel.  In contrast to used vegetable oil, is not a byproduct of other industries, and thus its prospects for use as fuel are not limited by the capacities of other industries. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Production of vegetable oils for use as fuels is theoretically limited only by the agricultural capacity of a given economy. However, doing so detracts from the supply of other uses of pure vegetable oil.

==Legal implications==

===Taxation of fuel===

Taxation on SVO/PPO as a road fuel varies from country to country. It is possible that the revenue departments in many countries are even unaware of its use or consider it too insignificant to legislate. Germany used to have 0% taxation, resulting in it being a leader in most developments of the fuel use.

'''Vertical innovation''' is an innovation on the quality of the goods; it consists to improve the quality of items by innovation permitting to those items to access to the highest quality available on the economy. In the literature of growth it is opposed to "horizontal innovation" which in turn refers to product innovation mean the introduction of new items in the economy. 'vertical integration' and 'open innovation'.&lt;ref&gt;Nottingham, John and Spirk, John (2011). Vertical Innovation in Action: Nottingham Spirk's Unique Approach. Retrieved 20 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[vertical integration]] describes a style of business [[management control]], and is typified by one firm engaged in different multiple parts of a production process. [[Open innovation]] is a term promoted by [[Henry Chesbrough]], a professor and executive director at the Center for Open Innovation at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. "Open innovation is a paradigm that assumes that firms can and should use external ideas as well as internal ideas, and internal and external paths to market, as the firms look to advance their technology."&lt;ref&gt;Chesbrough, H.W. (2003). ''Open Innovation: The new imperative for creating and profiting from technology''. Boston: Harvard Business School Press, p. xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;

The company [[Nottingham Spirk]] coined the phrase ''vertical innovation'' in 2011, to describe the proprietary process developed over the forty years at the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trademarks.justia.com/855/51/vertical-innovation-85551798.html|title=VERTICAL INNOVATION Trademark of Nottingham-Spirk Design Associates, Inc. - Registration Number 4344352 - Serial Number 85551798 :: Justia Trademarks|website=trademarks.Justia.com|access-date=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is a development strategy to take new product and service concepts and turn them into tangible items within a compressed time. Nottingham Spirk serves clients as an open innovation partner and uses a vertically integrated model to execute on development;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=11 June 2007|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/06/11/100061499/index.htm|title=Designers at Nottingham-Spirk invent for companies like GE - June 11, 2007|first=By Anne Fisher, Fortune senior|last=writer|website=money.CNN.com|access-date=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence a 'vertical innovation' strategy.

Vertical innovation is both a process to encourage efficient problem solving and a [[corporate culture]], where all development activities are handled by a cohesive and experienced team of experts. This group leverages the skills and talents of many individuals to move [[product development]] quickly forward. This process focuses on continuous improvement through each phase of a development program.

== Different product development and innovation approaches ==
=== Vertical innovation approach ===
Vertical innovation ideally takes place at one location, providing many points of collaboration, continuity in communication and helps ensure confidentiality. Co-located skill groups have individuals participating in each of the typical development stages: Market Analysis, Customer Insights, Ideation and Design, Engineering and Prototyping, Packaging and Retail Experience, Sourcing and Production Support. This allows for continual improvement and optimization at many points along the development process, while providing shortened development timelines. The vertical innovation approach also encourages random connections between different skill sets to provide the best chances for new and innovative advancements.

{{quote|A real-life example of a physical space that encourages creative collaboration is the building that houses [[Pixar]], the computer animation studio that created innovative, Academy-award-winning blockbuster films like Toy Story, Monsters and Finding Nemo. As Walter Isaacson writes in his biography of Steve Jobs, Jobs designed the Pixar building to promote chance encounters and unplanned collaborations. "If a building doesn't encourage that, you'll lose a lot of innovation and magic that's sparked by serendipity," Jobs said. "So we designed the building to make people get out of their offices and mingle in the central atrium with people they might not otherwise see." The front doors and main stairs and corridors all lead to a central atrium, where a cafe and employee mailboxes are located as well. John Lasseter, Chief Creative Officer at Pixar, confirmed the success of the building’s layout: 'Steve's theory worked from day one. I kept running into people I hadn't seen for months. I've never seen a building that promoted collaboration and creativity as well as this one.'|A.Meyer|openinnovation.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collaborativeinnovation.org/2012/02/encouraging-unplanned-collaborations-for-innovation/.|title=Meyer, Andrea. 9 February 2012. Encouraging Unplanned Collaborations for Innovation|website=CollaborativeInnovation.org|access-date=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Common innovation approach ===
Corporations commonly rely on different companies, groups or separate individuals for different skill sets. They use separate internal groups or external organizations to provide the skills necessary for innovation development. For example:
* a research group from an outside firm gathers customer insights
* an internal design group creates concepts
* another firm develops engineering layouts
* a third company handles intellectual property review
* a fourth builds the prototypes
* a fifth firm creates packaging
* and a final group organizes supply chain management

This chain of hand-offs typically lengthens development timelines, hinders innovative ideas and dilutes responsibilities needed for project success.

=== Open innovation approach ===
The central idea behind open innovation is that in a world of widely distributed knowledge, companies cannot afford to rely entirely on their own research, but should instead buy or license skills, processes or inventions (i.e. patents) from other individuals or companies.

This format makes use of many different inputs of skills and data into a development program. Because these connections can occur from the inside or outside of a company, there is still a high need for analysis, coordination, testing and maintaining of confidentiality.

Users have a VugaPay balance that is used for their transactions. They can link their [[mobile money]], [[bitcoin]], [[PayPal]] [[bank account]]s, [[debit card]]s, or [[credit card]]s to their VugaPay account. Paying with mobile money is free, but credit cards, bitcoin, PayPal and Bank accounts have a 3% fee for each transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vugapay.com/fees/|title=Pricing|work=VugaPay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a user does not have enough funds on VugaPay itself when making a transaction, it will automatically withdraw the supplemental funds from the registered mobile money, bank account or card.

== History ==
VugaPay was founded by two Rwandan brothers, Patrick Muhire and Cedrick Muhoza. 
After a few years of watching [[M-pesa]] evolve from a small transfer platform into a full-blown payment solution, Patrick wondered what it might look like if it were redesigned from the ground up; purely for all countries.
According to Patrick, the idea of VugaPay originated when Patrick wanted to transfer money from one mobile network operator to another. The process of sending money from one mobile network operator to another was a hassle, so they started working on a way to send money across all mobile network operators, interoperability for mobile money. Their original prototype sent money through MTN, TIGO, AIRTEL in Rwanda, but they eventually transitioned from Rwanda to the whole of East Africa, connecting telecoms in those regions.

Initially VugaPay was based on mobile money. VugaPay interoperable transfers are considered a hack through mobile money carriers and can be conducted on any carrier with mobile money services. These transfers are instant, with a large number of carriers from Africa. The East African reports some [[Confidence trick]] exploit this on [[mobile money]] systems and other services.

In late 2016, [[Timothy C. Draper]] made his second-African investment in VugaPay. VugaPay later introduced an open source mobile money api for merchants who would accept mobile money as payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=July 25, 2016|title=SPEEDUPAFRICA: 8 STARTUPS GET INVESTMENTS FROM DRAPERDARKFLOW, TORO ORERO AND TIM DRAPER|url=http://innovation-village.com/speedupafrica-8-startups-get-investments-draperdarkflow-toro-orero-tim-draper|publisher=Innovation Village}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Waste-to-energy (WtE)''' or '''energy-from-waste (EfW)''' is the process of generating energy in the form of [[electricity]] and/or [[heat]]  from the primary treatment of [[waste types|waste]], or the processing of waste into a fuel source. WtE is a form of [[energy recovery]].  Most WtE processes generate electricity and/or heat directly through combustion, or produce a combustible fuel commodity, such as [[methane]], [[methanol]], [[ethanol]] or [[synthetic fuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nwbiorenew.com/Technologies.htm|title=NW BIORENEW|publisher=|access-date=2009-06-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714213353/http://nwbiorenew.com/Technologies.htm|archive-date=2011-07-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{expand section|date=October 2016}}
The first [[incinerator]] or "Destructor" was built in [[Nottingham]] UK in 1874 by [[Manlove, Alliott &amp; Co. Ltd.]] to the design of Alfred Fryer.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Lewis (2007). "Centenary History of Waste and Waste Managers in London and South East England" (PDF). Chartered Institution of Wastes Management.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first US incinerator was built in 1885 on [[Governors Island]] in [[New York City|New York, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Recovery - Basic Information|publisher=US EPA|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/wte/basic.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first waste incinerator in [[Denmark]] was built in 1903 in [[Frederiksberg]]&lt;ref name=WtE_DK&gt;[http://www.zmag.dk/showmag.php?mid=wsdps Waste to Energy in Denmark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311071733/http://zmag.dk/showmag.php?mid=wsdps |date=2016-03-11 }} by [[Ramboll]] Consult&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Gasification and pyrolysis processes have been known and used for centuries and for coal  as  early  as the 18th century.... Development technologies for processing [residual solid mixed waste] has only become a focus of  attention in recent years stimulated by the search for more efficient energy recovery. (2004) &lt;ref name="Fichtner"&gt;[http://www.esauk.org/reports_press_releases/esa_reports/thermal_treatment_report.pdf ''The Viability of Advanced Thermal Treatment of MSW in the UK''] by Fichtner Consulting Engineers Ltd 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Methods ==

===Incineration===
{{Main|Incineration}}
Incineration, the combustion of organic material such as waste with energy recovery, is the most common WtE implementation. All new WtE plants in [[OECD]] countries incinerating waste (residual [[Municipal solid waste|MSW]], commercial, industrial or [[Refuse-derived fuel|RDF]]) must meet strict emission standards, including those on [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), [[sulphur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[heavy metals]] and [[dioxin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waste incineration|publisher=Europa|date=October 2011|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/environment/waste_management/l28072_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DIRECTIVE 2000/76/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 4 December 2000 on the incineration of waste|publisher=European Union|date=4 December 2000
|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2000:332:0091:0111:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, modern incineration plants are vastly different from old types, some of which neither recovered energy nor materials. Modern incinerators reduce the volume of the original waste by 95-96 percent, depending upon composition and degree of recovery of materials such as metals from the ash for recycling.&lt;ref name=WtE_DK /&gt;

Incinerators may emit fine [[particulate]], heavy metals, trace dioxin and [[acid gas]], even though these emissions are relatively low&lt;ref name=dmu2006&gt;[http://www2.dmu.dk/1_viden/2_Publikationer/3_fagrapporter/rapporter/FR442.pdf Emissionsfaktorer og emissionsopgørelse for decentral kraftvarme], Kortlægning af emissioner fra decentrale kraftvarmeværker, [[Ministry of the Environment of Denmark]] 2006 (in Danish)&lt;/ref&gt; from modern incinerators. Other concerns include proper management of residues: toxic [[fly ash]], which must be handled in hazardous waste disposal installation as well as [[incinerator bottom ash]] (IBA), which must be reused properly.&lt;ref name="bredl.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bredl.org/pdf/wastegasification.pdf|title=Waste Gasification: Impacts on the Environment and Public Health|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue that incinerators destroy valuable resources and they may reduce incentives for recycling.&lt;ref name="bredl.org"/&gt; The question, however, is an open one, as European countries which recycle the most (up to 70%) also incinerate to avoid [[landfill]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment in the EU27 Landfill still accounted for nearly 40% of municipal waste treated in the EU27 in 2010|publisher=European Union|date=27 March 2012|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STAT-12-48_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incinerators have electric efficiencies of 14-28%.&lt;ref name="bredl.org"/&gt; In order to avoid losing the rest of the energy, it can be used for e.g. [[district heating]] ([[cogeneration]]). The total efficiencies of cogeneration incinerators are typically higher than 80% (based on the [[lower heating value]] of the waste).

The method of incineration to convert municipal solid waste (MSW) is a relatively old method of WtE generation. Incineration generally entails burning waste (residual MSW, commercial, industrial and RDF) to boil water which powers [[steam generator]]s that generate electric energy and heat to be used in homes, businesses, institutions and industries. One problem associated is the potential for pollutants to enter the atmosphere with the flue gases from the boiler.  These pollutants can be acidic and in the 1980s were reported to cause environmental degradation by turning rain into [[acid rain]].  Since then, the industry has removed this problem by the use of [[Flue-gas desulfurization|lime scrubber]]s and electro-static precipitators on smokestacks.  By passing the smoke through the basic lime scrubbers, any acids that might be in the smoke are neutralized which prevents the acid from reaching the atmosphere and hurting the environment. Many other devices, such as fabric filters, reactors, and catalysts destroy or capture other regulated pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waste–to–Energy in Austria, White Book, 2nd Edition 2010|publisher=Austrian Ministry of Life|url=http://www.iswa.org/fileadmin/galleries/Publications/White%20Book/Whitebook_20Incineration_2009[1].pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the New York Times, modern incineration plants are so clean that "many times more dioxin is now released from home fireplaces and backyard barbecues than from incineration. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/science/earth/13trash.html?scp=1&amp;sq=trash&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Elisabeth | last=Rosenthal | title=Europe Finds Clean Energy in Trash, but U.S. Lags | date=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the German Environmental Ministry, "because of stringent regulations, waste incineration plants are no longer significant in terms of emissions of dioxins, dust, and heavy metals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.seas.columbia.edu/earth/wtert/sofos/Waste_Incineration_A_Potential_Danger.pdf | title = Waste incineration – A potential danger?

===Other===
There are a number of other new and emerging technologies that are able to produce energy from waste and other fuels without direct combustion. Many of these technologies have the potential to produce more electric power from the same amount of fuel than would be possible by direct combustion. This is mainly due to the separation of corrosive components (ash) from the converted fuel, thereby allowing higher combustion temperatures in e.g. [[boiler]]s, [[gas turbine]]s, [[internal combustion engine]]s, [[fuel cell]]s. Some are able to efficiently convert the energy into [[liquid fuel|liquid]] or gaseous fuels:

*[[Gasification]]: produces combustible gas, [[hydrogen]], [[synthetic fuel]]s
*[[Thermal depolymerization]]: produces synthetic crude oil, which can be further refined
*[[Pyrolysis]]: produces combustible [[tar]]/[[biooil]] and [[char]]s
*[[Plasma arc gasification]] or plasma gasification process (PGP): produces rich [[syngas]] including [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]] usable for fuel cells or generating electricity to drive the plasma arch, usable vitrified silicate and metal ingots, salt and sulphur

*[[Fermentation (biochemistry)|Fermentation]] production: examples are ethanol, lactic acid, hydrogen

**MBT to [[Refuse derived fuel]]

==Global developments==
During the 2001&amp;ndash;2007 period, the waste-to-energy capacity increased by about four million metric tons per year.
Japan and China each built several plants based on direct smelting or on [[fluidized bed combustion]] of solid waste. 
In China there are about 434 waste-to-energy plants in early 2016. 
Japan is the largest user in thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in the world, with 40 million tons.
Some of the newest plants use stoker technology and others use the advanced oxygen enrichment technology. 
Several treatment plants exist worldwide using relatively novel processes such as direct smelting, the Ebara fluidization process and the Thermoselect JFE gasification and melting technology process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://events.engineering.columbia.edu/waste-council-attracts-experts-worldwide|work=columbia.edu|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In India its first energy bio-science center was developed to reduce the country’s green house gases and its dependency on fossil fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleantech.com/news/4536/mumbai-institute-opens-india |title=India opens first energy biosciences center - Cleantech Group |date=7 June 2009 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607011224/http://www.cleantech.com/news/4536/mumbai-institute-opens-india |archivedate=7 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As of June 2014, Indonesia had a total of 93.5 MW installed capacity of waste-to-energy, with a pipeline of projects in different preparation phases together amounting to another 373MW of capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/reports/technology/waste-to-energy-in-indonesia |title=Waste to energy in Indonesia |publisher=The Carbon Trust|date=June 2014 |accessdate=22 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofuel Energy Corporation of Denver, CO, opened two new [[biofuel]] plants in [[Wood River, Nebraska]], and [[Fairmont, Minnesota]], in July 2008. 
These plants use distillation to make ethanol for use in motor vehicles and other engines.  Both plants are currently reported to be working at over 90% capacity. 
Fulcrum BioEnergy incorporated located in [[Pleasanton, California]], is building a WtE plant near [[Reno, NV]].  The plant is scheduled to open in 2019 under the name of Sierra BioFuels plant.  BioEnergy incorporated predicts that the plant will produce approximately 10.5 million gallons per year of ethanol from nearly 200,000 tons per year of MSW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fulcrum-bioenergy.com/facilities/|title=Fulcrum BioEnergy|website=fulcrum-bioenergy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waste to energy technology includes [[fermentation]], which can take [[biomass]] and create [[ethanol]], using waste [[cellulosic]] or organic material. In the fermentation process, the sugar in the waste is changed to carbon dioxide and alcohol, in the same general process that is used to make wine. Normally fermentation occurs with no air present. 
[[Esterification]] can also be done using waste to energy technologies, and the result of this process is biodiesel. The cost effectiveness of esterification will depend on the feedstock being used, and all the other relevant factors such as transportation distance, amount of oil present in the feedstock, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bionomicfuel.com/cost-effective-waste-to-energy-technologies/|title=Cost Effective Waste to Energy Technologies – Updated Article With Extra Information|work=bionomicfuel.com|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gasification and pyrolysis by now can reach gross thermal conversion efficiencies (fuel to gas) up to 75%, however a complete combustion is superior in terms of fuel conversion efficiency.&lt;ref name="Fichtner"/&gt; Some pyrolysis processes need an outside heat source which may be supplied by the gasification process, making the combined process self-sustaining.

==Carbon dioxide emissions==
In thermal WtE technologies, nearly all of the carbon content in the waste is emitted as [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) to the atmosphere (when including final combustion of the products from pyrolysis and gasification; except when producing bio-char for fertilizer). [[Municipal solid waste]] (MSW) contain approximately the same mass fraction of carbon as {{CO2}} itself (27%), so treatment of {{convert|1|metric ton|short ton}} of MSW produce approximately {{convert|1|metric ton|short ton}} of {{CO2}}.

In the event that the waste was [[landfill]]ed, {{convert|1|metric ton|short ton}} of MSW would produce approximately {{convert|62|m3|cuft}} [[methane]] via the [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] decomposition of the [[biodegradable waste|biodegradable]] part of the waste. This amount of methane has more than twice the [[global warming potential]] than the {{convert|1|metric ton|short ton}} of {{CO2}}, which would have been produced by combustion. In some countries, large amounts of [[landfill gas]] are collected, but still the global warming potential of the landfill gas emitted to atmosphere in e.g. the US in 1999 was approximately 32% higher than the amount of {{CO2}} that would have been emitted by combustion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Themelis, Nickolas J. [http://www.seas.columbia.edu/earth/papers/global_waste_to_energy.html An overview of the global waste-to-energy industry], Waste Management World 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, nearly all biodegradable waste is [[biomass]]. That is, it has biological origin. This material has been formed by plants using atmospheric {{CO2}} typically within the last growing season. If these plants are regrown the {{CO2}} emitted from their combustion will be taken out from the atmosphere once more.

Such considerations are the main reason why several countries administrate WtE of the biomass part of waste as [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090326073442/http://www.r-e-a.net/power/biomass-bioenergy/energy-from-waste], from the homepage of the UK Renewable Energy Association&lt;/ref&gt; The rest—mainly plastics and other oil and gas derived products—is generally treated as [[Non-renewable resources|non-renewables]].

===Determination of the biomass fraction===
MSW to a large extent is of biological origin (biogenic), e.g. paper, cardboard, wood, cloth, food scraps. Typically half of the energy content in MSW is from biogenic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More recycling raises average energy content of waste used to generate electricity|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration|date=September 2012|url=http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=8010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, this energy is often recognised as renewable energy according to the waste input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources|publisher=European Union|date=April 23, 2009|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:140:0016:0062:en:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several methods have been developed by the European CEN 343 working group to determine the biomass fraction of waste fuels, such as [[Refuse Derived Fuel]]/Solid Recovered Fuel. The initial two methods developed (CEN/TS 15440) were the '''manual sorting method''' and the '''selective dissolution method'''. A detailed systematic comparison of these two methods was published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VFR-4YBMT6V-4&amp;_user=217827&amp;_coverDate=07%2F31%2F2010&amp;_alid=1412152242&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=6017&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=2&amp;_acct=C000011279&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=217827&amp;md5=565ba44df8165c6b99c6722f5fbe30c5 ''The biogenic content of process streams from mechanical–biological treatment plants producing solid recovered fuel. Do the manual sorting and selective dissolution determination methods correlate?''] by Mélanie Séverin, Costas A. Velis, Phil J. Longhurst and Simon J.T. Pollard., 2010. In: ''Waste Management'' 30(7): 1171-1182&lt;/ref&gt; Since each method suffered from limitations in properly characterizing the biomass fraction, two alternative methods have been developed.

The first method uses the principles of [[radiocarbon dating]]. A technical review (CEN/TR 15591:2007) outlining the [[carbon 14 method]] was published in 2007. A technical standard of the carbon dating method (CEN/TS 15747:2008) will be published in 2008.{{update after|2008|12|31}} In the United States, there is already an equivalent carbon 14 method under the standard method ASTM D6866.

The second method (so-called '''balance method''') employs existing data on materials composition and operating conditions of the WtE plant and calculates the most probable result based on a mathematical-statistical model.&lt;ref&gt;''A New Method to Determine the Ratio of Electricity Production from Fossil and Biogenic Sources in Waste-to-Energy Plants.'' by Fellner, J., Cencic, O. and Rechberger, H., 2007. In: ''Environmental Science &amp; Technology,'' 41(7): 2579-2586.
&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the balance method is installed at three Austrian and eight Danish incinerators.

A comparison between both methods carried out at three full-scale incinerators in Switzerland showed that both methods came to the same results.&lt;ref&gt;''Determination of biogenic and fossil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted by waste incineration based on &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and mass balances.'' by Mohn, J., Szidat, S., Fellner, J., Rechberger, H., Quartier, R., Buchmann, B. and Emmenegger, L., 2008. In: ''Bioresource Technology,'' 99: 6471-6479.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon 14 dating can determine with precision the biomass fraction of waste, and also determine the biomass calorific value. Determining the calorific value is important for green certificate programs such as the Renewable Obligation Certificate program in the United Kingdom. These programs award certificates based on the energy produced from biomass. Several research papers, including the one commissioned by the [[Renewable Energy Association]] in the UK, have been published that demonstrate how the carbon 14 result can be used to calculate the biomass calorific value. The UK gas and electricity markets authority, [[Ofgem]], released a statement in 2011 accepting the use of Carbon 14 as a way to determine the biomass energy content of waste feedstock under their administration of the Renewables Obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Sustainability/Environment/RenewablObl/FuelledStations/Documents1/14C%20publicity.pdf|title=Fuelled stations and FMS|work=ofgem.gov.uk|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their Fuel Measurement and Sampling (FMS) questionnaire describes the information they look for when considering such proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Pages/MoreInformation.aspx?docid=363&amp;refer=Sustainability/Environment/RenewablObl/FuelledStations|title=Fuel Measurement and Sampling (FMS) Questionnaire: Carbon-14|work=ofgem.gov.uk|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of waste-to-energy plants==

Initially scheduled for completion during 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/2009/01/13/enerkem-to-squeeze-biofuel-out-of-old-electricity-poles/ |title=Enerkem to Squeeze Biofuel Out of Old Electricity Poles |publisher=gigaom.com|date=January 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; commissioning of front-end systems commenced in December 2013 and Enerkem then expected initial methanol production during 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/enerkem-begins-commissioning-of-front-end-systems-at-the-enerkem-alberta-biofuels-facility-in-edmonton-canada-234229341.html Enerkem press release December 2013] found at the PR Newswire webpage.&lt;/ref&gt; Production start has been delayed several times. As of spring 2016 Enerkem expected ethanol production to commence some time ín 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://enerkem.com/facilities/enerkem-alberta-biofuels/ |title=Enerkem Website |publisher=Enerkem|date=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and no public confirmation of any actual RDF processing was available.

* The US Air Force once tested a Transportable Plasma Waste to Energy System (TPWES) facility (PyroGenesis technology) at Hurlburt Field, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afsoc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123253735 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509083529/http://www.afsoc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123253735 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-09 |title=AFSOC makes 'green' history while investing in future |publisher=US Air Force Special Operations Command |accessdate=2011-04-28 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The plant, which cost $7.4 million to construct,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/5745/pyrogenesis-perfecting-plasma | title=Pyrogenesis Perfecting Plasma|publisher=Biomass Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; was closed and sold at a government liquidation auction in May 2013, less than three years after its commissioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govliquidation.com/auction/view?auctionId=6241220|title=PyroGenesis Plasma Gasification and Waste Incineration System|website=Government Liquidation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rewmag.com/dod-gasification-auction-pyrogenesis.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018222036/http://www.rewmag.com/dod-gasification-auction-pyrogenesis.aspx |archive-date=2014-10-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening bid was $25.  The winning bid was sealed.

Besides large plants, domestic waste-to-energy incinerators also exist. For example, the [[refuge de Sarenne]] has a domestic waste-to-energy plant. It is made by combining a wood-fired gasification boiler with a [[Stirling motor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connaissancedesenergies.org/un-refuge-de-montagne-au-sommet-de-l-autonomie-energetique-120705|title=Autonomie énergétique pour un refuge de montagne : panneaux solaires|date=5 July 2012|work=Connaissance des Énergies|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kingtigergroup.com/biomass-carbonization-plant/?NodeID=1&amp;EditoID=200054|title=Waste Biomass Carbonization Plant - KG Biomass Plant|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
