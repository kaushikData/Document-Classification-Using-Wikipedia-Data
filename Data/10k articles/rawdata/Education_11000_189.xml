      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6113">'''Atel''' is a French-derivative and nonsensical [[Bengali language|Bengali]] term, used as [[noun]] and [[pronoun]] in [[Bengali language]], which is the inferior term for [[intellectual]].&lt;ref name=btr&gt;{{Cite news|title=চলতি শব্দের অভিধান - পর্ব-এক|url=http://www.banglatribune.com/literature/news/84093/চলতি-শব্দের-অভিধান-পর্ব-এক|accessdate=18 May 2018|work=মোহাম্মদ মামুন অর রশীদ|publisher=[[Bangla Tribune]]|date=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ananda&gt;{{Cite news|title=আঁতেল কারে কয়|url=http://archives.anandabazar.com/archive/1130320/20ananda-plus2.html|accessdate=18 May 2018|work=রেশমি বাগচি|publisher=[[Anandabazar]]|date=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lexical sense, Atel is a scholar (derogatorily), wise person, person of the type of intellectual, which is coming from the French dialect of intellectual, or the French intellectual pronunciation of English intellectual. A person who is proficient in academic practice, but lacks the sensuality and practical knowledge is called Atel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meaning of আঁতেল - Bangla to Bangla / English Dictionary|url=http://www.ovidhan.org/b2b/আঁতেল|website=www.ovidhan.org|publisher=ovidhan.org|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person who pretends as being intelligent also identified as Atel.&lt;ref name=btr/&gt; According to the linguist Pabitra Sarkar, "In the forty-five decades, a class of Bengali intellectuals emerged, who used to regularly sit in the coffee house, wore [[Panjabi (garment)|Panjabi]] and considered themselves best; seeing these intellectuals, the word context was applied according to the ridicule and reaction of others."&lt;ref name=ananda/&gt;

==Use==
According to Indian author Nrisingh Prasad Vauduri, winner of the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]], "The word intellectual is found since in the Bachelorette meeting (Swayambara Sava) of [[Draupadi]]. Immediately after [[Arjuna]] and Raja-Maharaja (kings-emperors) came to the meeting, ''Nipuna Buddhijibina (perfect intellectuals)'' appeared at the meeting. In this context, the question is whether this will be done or not. He described the character of Karna of Mahabharata as ''Atel''. According to him, "I can all understand the "I can do everything" mentality of the Karna, we manifest the ego in his behavior. On the battlefield, [[Dushasana]] died, but Karna could not do anything, yet he advised [[Duryodhana]] not to be anxious. Yet today, where there is the trend of being middlemen doing nothing, so the meaning of the word ''Atel'' has gradually changed to us."&lt;ref name=ananda/&gt;

In the May 2017, the [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh]] [[Sheikh Hasina]] said in the session of parliament pointing towards the rescued social activist and author [[Farhad Mazhar]] after the disappearance, "One of our renowned ''Atel'' disappeared as kidnapped. Later we saw that he was not kidnapped. He himself went to Khulna. Later he was found. This fault is ours. There are many more such cases happening.

Former chairman of the Department of Language Studies of [[Shahjalal University of Science and Technology]], Shafiuddin Ahmed said in response to the question of "how much our generation is progressive", "Our boys and girls are more meritorious than boys and girls of other countries. You see, when they goes out, there in the case of studying, innovation, entrepreneur, they keep the sign of good credit. But they are not able to do it here, because we can not teach them that ourselves. When a nation's teachers, artists, writers, poets, intellectuals become ''Atel'', party-oriented, and dependeant, then, the nation becomes damaged.

'''Baron Omar Rolf von Ehrenfels''' (born 28 April 1901 in [[Prague]] - died 7 February 1980 in Neckargemünd, Heidelberg, Germany) was a prominent [[Muslim]] of [[Austria]]n origin.

== Life outline ==
[[File:Rolf Ehrenfels 1903 Langhans.jpg|thumb|Rolf von Ehrenfels as a child, 1903]]
'''Omar''', or as he later chose, '''Umar Rolf Ehrenfels''' was born 28 April 1901 in Prague, Austria. He was baptised Rolf Werner Leopold von Ehrenfels. His father was Roman Catholic Baron [[Christian von Ehrenfels]] (1859–1932) professor of philosophy at the German part of [[Prague University]]. He is known as the founder of the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Ueber Gestalt qvalitaeten 1890. Weinhandl ed. 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was '''Emma von Ehrenfels''' (1862–1946) born André, in Bratislava (Pressburg). In her parental home both German and Hungarian was spoken. During World War I she worked for the Red Cross caring for Hungarian wounded soldiers. Widowed of her first marriage she brought her daughter '''Elfriede (Elfi) Hartmann'''  into their home. The second daughter, known as the author '''Imma von Bodmershof'''  (1895–1983), was born in [[Graz]]. Rolf as the only son of Christian Freiherr von Ehrenfels inherited the title but he had to discard it according to new Austrian laws in 1920. As a convert to Islam he took on the name Omar or Umar, kept Rolf and omitted the others. 1932–37 he was a student of social anthropology (Völkerkunde) at Vienna University and got a doctorate there.&lt;ref&gt;Vienna University has the original copy of his unprinted dissertation ''Mutterecht in Vorderindien'' (1937).&lt;/ref&gt; At the Nazi occupation of Austria, Anschluss, 13 March 1938, he emigrated to India. There he lived until 1961, since 1949 as lecturer, later professor of social anthropology at the University of Madras.&lt;ref&gt;Vidyarthi, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Umar Rolf Ehrenfels died 7 February 1980 in Neckargemuend, Germany having been guest professor at Heidelberg University and co- founder of its [[South Asia Institute]] 1961-71.&lt;ref&gt;Jettmar, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;  Elfriede von Bodmershof (1894–1982) was his wife 1925–1948. The couple was separated due to the Nazi occupation of 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenfels, 1952) p. 293 note 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Ehrenfels married the French social scientist Mireille Abeille (1924–2007).

== An Austrian citizen with strong family ties ==
Rolf Ehrenfels was an Austrian citizen all his life. [[Lichtenau im Waldviertel|Lichtenau]] near [[Krems an der Donau|Krems]] and [[Gföhl]] in Lower Austria was his home parish. Since 1813 the Ehrenfels family were settled in Schloss Lichtenau. Also the castles Brunn im Walde and Rastbach were family properties. Rolf's eldest sister '''"Elfi" Elfriede Hartmann''' married a widower with three children and had her own home from the early 1920s. His sister Imma Ehrenfels married '''Wilhelm "Willy" (von) Bodmershof''' (Schuster)and they settled at Rastbach castle for life. In 1925 there was a double wedding as Rolf Ehrenfels married Willy's sister '''Fridl''' who became [[Elfriede Ehrenfels]]. She was born in Trieste, Austria.

== A young intellectual in the Berlin of the 1920s ==
For a period Rolf lived in Berlin. His first wife Ellen Feld can be seen as she has a part in a film, '''Das grosse Sehnen ''', for which Rolf wrote the manuscript. Rolf and his friend '''Willy Bodmershof''' worked on it together and shot it partly in a studio in Berlin, partly on location in Istanbul in 1923. On this trip, partly by bicycle, Rolf's interest in Islam was kindled.&lt;ref name="Hackzell"&gt;Hackzell, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also Christian von Ehrenfels appears in it, as a wise man. There are still photos in Ehrenfels archive, Lichtenau. The film is now in the Austrian Film Museum in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Personal communication Leela Ehrenfels.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was reviewed by '''Kurt Bauchwitz''' as press clippings in the Ehrenfels archive show. Kurt was one of the intellectual Jews in the Berlin Wilmersdorf area. With him Rolf Ehrenfels developed a friendship for life. Kurt called himself '''Roy C Bates''' when he had escaped to the USA after 1933. Their relationship is documented in the Roy C Bates papers in the Grenander Collections at Albany University, USA.

== A European Muslim ==
Around 1926 Rolf made up his mind to convert to Islam. He took on the name Omar, used in his Muslim circles, Rolf in the family. (Later he turned a [[Sufist]] using different invented Sufi names.) In Berlin Omar got attached to the [[Wilmersdorfer Moschee]] of Ahmadyya Anjuman located in Brienner Strasse near Fehrbelliner Platz.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Germain, 2008 gives the history of Muslim Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy and religion were common interests to Rolf and his wife from 1925, Elfriede Ehrenfels. She contributed to academic journals of philosophy. She was never a Muslim but attracted by [[Baha'ism]]. Christian Ehrenfels major work ''Kosmogonie'' (Jena 1916, English translation by M. Focht New York: Comet Press, 1948) fascinated them.&lt;ref name="Ehrenfels"&gt;Leela Ehrenfels, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Together Omar and Fridl made car tours in Muslim Europe, Bosnia and Albania, in 1929 and 1935. In 1931- 38 Omar wrote several important articles for the Berlin mosque journal started in 1924, [[Moslemische Revue]], after he got a copy of it from the Imam Abdullah Effendi Kurbegovic (1873–1933) at the Great Mosque in [[Sarajevo]].&lt;ref&gt;Moslemische Revue 1934 p. 43 Jubilee issue after 10 years. MR is now digitilised in ahmadyya.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Living at Lichtenau Omar was one of the editorial board. He also wrote for Muslim Journals in English, connected to the Lahori Ahmadiyya e.g. at Woking.&lt;ref&gt;See Islam in Inter-War Europe&lt;/ref&gt; At his death in 1980 Umar Rolf was said to be the oldest Muslim by choice, "Wahlmuslim", in Europe. He wrote Muslim (Sufist) articles until the end (''Sifat'', Zuerich,1978).

== On the track of Kurban Said ==

=== Young writers at fruitful work ===
Like brother and sister Willy and Fridl Bodmershof did, Rolf tried his luck both as freelance journalist and fiction writer. Kurt Bauchwitz and the circles in Berlin (Wilmersdorf?) encouraged him. He got many articles published, mostly under different pseudonyms. His best known one was '''Othmar Steinmetz'''. Soon Rolf and Fridl became a writing couple. "My wife and literary co- worker since 1925, has assisted considerably in the planning and laying- out of the book, and Count and Countess Coudenhove- Kalergis in the completion of the manuscript as well as productive criticism". This Rolf Ehrenfels writes in his doctoral dissertation, written 1937 in German, as it was printed in English in 1941. The Preface is dated "Hyderabad, Deccan June 24th 1940".&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenfels, 1941, Preface p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; 
From 1927 (?) the two married couples, Imma- Willy Bodmershof and Fridl- Rolf Ehrenfels, lived mostly at Lichtenau and Rastbach, doubly occupied with farming work on the estate and writing. The Ehrenfels parents' home was in Prague, the Bodmershof's in Trieste. Both Willy and Rolf managed to finish doctorates: Rolf Ehrenfels in Vienna in 1937, Wilhelm Bodmershof at Graz University in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Book catalog: Grundbegriffe und Bau der Volkswirtschaft, 1933. Dis. Graz Univ.&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to connections with his father's students in Prague and his mother's friends in cultural, feminist circles in Prague and Vienna Rolf got the opportunity to publish articles and also a serialized novel in Prager Tagblatt in 88 parts called ''Ein Kriegskind sucht das Glück'' by Othmar Steinmetz. The date of the complete manuscript in the Lichtenau archive is 13 March 1930. In the archive there are other manuscripts and letters, among others to Tal Verlag, which confirm that Rolf and Elfriede Ehrenfels wrote novels together. They agreed to put one of their names on the text in turns. Evidently with the Kurban Said's novels it was Elfriede's turn {{verification needed|date=November 2011}}. After Rolf had escaped to India February 1939 after eight months in Greece together there was no more Kurban Said.&lt;ref&gt;Accounts by Rolf in Ehrenfels archive, Lichteanu. Letters to Kurt Bauchwitz/Roy C Bates.{{verification needed|date=November 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Copyright debate on Kurban Said ===
The copyright sign is, or rather should be, the ultimate proof Elfriede Ehrenfels born Bodmershof has the right to be called the originator of the two novels by the pseudonym [[Kurban Said]]. ''Ali und Nino'' published in 1937 by Tal Verlag in Vienna is the best known. In Europe the [http://Berne%20Convention%20for%20the%20Proection%20of%20Literary%20and%20Artistic%20Work Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Work] of 1886 gives the person whose name is behind the copyright sign the right to be identified as the author of a book. Both publishers and authors had an interest not to have their work stolen. The publisher's right is/was something else, drawn up in a contract. National bibliographies were printed yearly. For years the massive American National Union Catalog NUC, listing books in the Congress library, was printed. Both NUC and the German bibliography ''Gesamtverzeichnis'' GV give the information that Kurban Said is Elfriede Ehrenfels. The convention is different in the USA. Americans are not always aware of this. It is a misunderstanding that "authorities" gave away copyright after Austria was occupied by Nazi-Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss 1999, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The occupation power printed its sign, the swastika, wherever they wanted. And they wanted it everywhere.&lt;ref name="Ehrenfels"/&gt;
Professor '''Gerhard Hoepp's''' (1942–2003) research is a major source to '''[[Tom Reiss]]''' as he elaborated an article of 1999 into a book 2005. However, in his article of 2001 ''Who wrote ''Ali and Nino'': to the archaeology of a legend''&lt;ref&gt;Hoepp, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Hoepp sums up competing theories in a review of new editions (Overlook, New York, 1999; Ullstein, Berlin 2000) of ''Ali and Nino'' combined with Tom Reiss' article.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, 1999, now digitalised&lt;/ref&gt; Hoepp states "dass Elfriede von Ehrenfels- Bodmershof, die auch den Vertrag fuer ''Ali und Nino'' unterzeichnete, Kurban Said war, steht inzwischen ausser Zeifel." (That EEB, who also signed the contract for A&amp;N, was Kurban Said, is since then beyond doubt.) The contract for Ali und Nino was made with Mr Tal, who only signed Tal, which appears from the contract shown to Tom Reiss.
His widow Lucy in 1973 tried to take over the copyright owned by Elfriede Ehrenfels.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Tal, confiding in her lawyer Schoenberg and acting in good faith, was shocked to learn that the Kurban Said books had been registered in Elfriede Ehrenfels name. She felt that she had as much claims as publisher to Ali and Nino as did Elfriede Ehrenfels who had registered the novel. Frequently Asked Questions FAQ 31 and 32 in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue in the 2000s has become, as if a woman could not have achieved a novel on her own: Who was her co-writer? '''Essad Bey''' was a guess from the 1930s according to Hoepp. This guess was adopted and developed by Reiss (1999, 2005). The second wave of publication from 1970 introduced the Azerbaijan author [[Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli]] as the sole Kurban Said. "Obwohl diese Annamhe nicht halten lässt" (although this belief does not stand to tests). Hoepp says, it was spread by the Turkish publisher and later in the Soviet Union of the Glasnost. There was no more talk of Elfriede Ehrenfels.&lt;ref&gt;Hoepp 2001 p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli|Chamanzaminli]] theory was researched by the magazine [[Azerbaijan International]]. AI exhibits the covers of about a hundred editions of Ali and Nino and has published an extensive analysis of their research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_index_eng.html Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4 (2011), 364 pages. Available in English and Azerbaijani language.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On a few, a portrait of Elfriede appears, on one (German 2001), she is shown together with Omar Rolf, from a portrait in the film ''Das grosse Sehnen''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azer.com/aiweb/an_covers/123_ali_nino_cover.html See '''Ali and Nino'' in 33 languages].&lt;/ref&gt; Fridl Ehrenfels' obvious co-writer, if any, was her husband Omar Rolf. His inside knowledge of Islam was significant.&lt;ref name="Hackzell"/&gt;

Gerhard Hoepp does not go into this. He is a scientist and has done no research on Ehrenfels, but he has published research on [[Lev Nussimbaum|Lev Noussimbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoepp, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoepp in 1997 considers Essad Bey as the co-author of ''Ali and Nino''. One of the informants he mentions is Professor Dr. '''Heinz Barazon'''. Reiss 2005 shows that he is the legal adviser of Rolf Ehrenfels' widow Mireille Ehrenfels and their daughter Leela Ehrenfels. Some of the data on ''Ali and Nino'' from 1970 into the 2000s build on gossip running in Vienna after Anschluss 13 March 1938, as told by Dr Barazon to Tom Reiss, and also distorted memories of aged informants.&lt;ref name="Reiss"&gt;Reiss, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Mireille Ehrenfels gave the wrong year (1937) and causes for the separation between Rolf and Fridl (conflicts) to the family lawyer Dr Barazon.&lt;ref name="Hackzell"/&gt;
Rolf Ehrenfels in ''Mother- right in India'' (1941) says they wrote together since 1925. In ''Kadar of Cochin'' he states that Fridl was with him during the first eight months of his exile spent in Greece. She did her own research in Greece and her interest continues. They correspond on topics even 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenfels, 1952 p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== No need for de- Nazification ===
Reiss' argumentation builds on his theory that there was a need for "the family´s de- Nazification".&lt;ref&gt;Reiss 1999 p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be compared to documented facts visible also on the dust jacket of Umar Rolf Ehrenfels' "The Light Continent" (1960). "Escaping the Hitler terror when the Nazis occupied Austria, Dr. U.R. Ehrenfels, born at Prague in 1901, took refuge in India in 1939." After respect to his father Christian we are informed of travels to the East and studies. "/In Vienna/ Ehrenfels became founder- president of Der Orientbund, an Afro-Asian students' federation." After a trip to India 1932- 33 "he went back to become the co- editor of ''Gerechtigkeit'' (justice) in Vienna, a journal which stood for the integrity of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and for Human Rights when Italy invaded that country." The book has a printed dedication: "In memoriam the victims of Sharpeville and Lunda" and to his wife Mireille called Mie.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenfels, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Tom Reiss did not go deep enough into the documents shown to him when he visited Lichtenau in 1998. "De- Nazification" was a British invention that all prisoners of internment camps had to go through after 1945. Also Jews who had escaped to India to save themselves from Holocaust were exposed to the process. Not all succeeded.&lt;ref name="Hackzell"/&gt; Facts about this are not on the Internet. It seems to be a taboo subject to historians. Reiss solves a "mystery" by turning victims of Nazism into Nazists.&lt;ref name="Reiss"/&gt;

=== A legal copyright owner and defender of authorship ===
The Berne Convention copyright law is the reason why Elfriede Ehrenfels in her will could let her right go on to Rolf's and Mireille's daughter Leela Ehrenfels at Fridl's death in 1982.&lt;ref name="Ehrenfels"/&gt;

===Alternative point of view regarding actual authorship of "Ali and Nino"===
For those wishing to examine the question of the actual authorship of the novel "[[Ali and Nino]]", see [[Azerbaijan International]].&lt;ref&gt;Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4 (2011) [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_index_eng.html Who Wrote Azerbaijan Most Famous Novel: "[[Ali and Nino]]"? The Business of Literature]" 364 pages, 1200 photos.&lt;/ref&gt; The staff of [[Azerbaijan International]] magazine spent six years of extensive research in 10 languages (Azeri, Russian, English, German, French, Italian, Georgian, Turkish, Persian and Swedish) before publishing their results, which are meticulously documented from research carried out in the National Archives of various countries including Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine and Germany.

There is no doubt that Elfriede Ehrenfels registered the pseudonym [[Kurban Said]] in her own name for [[Ali and Nino: A Love Story|"Ali and Nino"]] and "Girl from the Golden Horn." [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai124_folder/124_articles/124_readers_forum.html See photos of registration].&lt;ref&gt;[http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai124_folder/124_articles/124_readers_forum.html Ali and Nino Copyright by Leela Ehrenfels], Azerbaijan International, Vol. 12:4 (Winter 2004), pp. 10 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yes, there are first edition copies of [[Kurban Said|Kurban Said's]] books in Elfriede's metal chest at the Lichtenau Castle but that is not proof of authorship. It would be quite natural for someone who had registered the novels to have copies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_pdf/152_pdf_english/ai_152_index_eng.pdf See photos, Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4, p. 57.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Correspondence exists in the personal archives of the publisher of the book - Lucy Tal - indicating she had never met Elfriede Ehrenfels and was totally surprised to find that the Elfriede Ehrenfels had registered the pseudonym "Kurban Said" in her name.&lt;ref&gt;Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4 (2011), [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_articles/English/152_faq_list.html Frequently Asked Questions about the Authorship of Ali and Nino], FAQ 31 Who did Lucy Tal think had written "Ali and Nino"? p. 59; and FAQ 32.

== A passage to India 1932- 33 ==
In an attempt to overcome the grief at his beloved father's death Umar Rolf made a journey to India in 1932-33. Together with the Imam of the Wilmersdorfer Mosque in Berlin, former professor in Lahore Dr S.M. Abdullah, Baron Omar made a lecture tour from [[Lahore]] in the north to Hyderabad in the south as an advocate of the [[Ahmadiya]] movement.&lt;ref name="Germain"&gt;Germain, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He sent reports from the tour printed in newspapers. At home again he lectured. The tour affected him so much that Umar Rolf decided to give his life a new turn. He made India his main life project. His interest was deep. His father's colleague the Indologist professor [[Moriz Winternitz]] (1863–1937) had taught Rolf as a boy. He had met high-ranking Indians in his home among them the Nobel Prize Laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]] (1861–1941). [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s close man Vallabhai [[Patel]] (1875–1950) was the patron of Der Orientbund in Vienna, which Umar Rolf founded 1932 and presided until his escape to India 1938. What Ehrenfels saw of women's position on the tour 1932-33 made him choose to study social anthropology at Vienna University. In 1937 he got his doctorate with the dissertation "Mutterrecht in Vorderindien". It was translated by himself and published in Hyderbad/Dn in 1941 as "Mother-right in India".

== Refugee from Nazist Austria in British India ==
In 1938 Umar Rolf Ehrenfels lived in Vienna. He was known as a convert to Islam and founding president of the multiracial students' society in Vienna called Der Orientbund or Islamischer Kulturbund. His doctoral dissertation of 1937 built on a strongly anti- Aryan theory. As an active anti- fascist Umar Rolf had to flee to save his life after the Nazi occupation of Austria 13 March 1938. His wife Elfriede did not want to leave Austria. Rolf tried to protect her from harassment by a divorce in 1938, which was denied.&lt;ref&gt;Hackzell, 2011. Documents in Ehrenfels archive.&lt;/ref&gt; Franz Kafka's friend and biographer Max Brod (1884–1968) was editor of Prager Tageblatt that had published many texts by Rolf. Brod managed to warn Rolf, who was lecturing in Prague, not to go back to Vienna, where he was on the Nazi death list. In 1939 Brod fled to Tel Aviv. He stayed in contact with Umar Rolf for life. They were engaged in JCM, an organisation to near the three religions. This was a recurrent theme of the Moslemische revue from 1924 on.&lt;ref name="Germain"/&gt;
Ehrenfels left his home by way of Greece trying to find solutions. His wife went with him and friends came to support him.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenfels, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to Sir [[Akbar Hydari]] (1869–1941) Baron von Ehrenfels in 1939 could escape to be the guest of The Nizam of [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] Deccan in South India. ''Motherright in India'' has a printed dedication saying: "To Sir Akbar Hydari, the Chancellor of the [[Osmania University]], the distinguished promoter of science and learning in India." According to plans Ehrenfels was to become professor of a new department of anthropology but a Nazi party member from Vienna came in his way.&lt;ref&gt;Jettmar, 1980. Hackzell, 2011. Ehrenfels archive. Roy C Bates papers.&lt;/ref&gt; One trace of this plan is ''Ilm-ul Aqam''. It is anthropological textbook for students in two volumes translated from Ehrenfels' manuscript in English into Urdu by Dr. Syed Abid Hussain.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenfels, 1952 p 2 note 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  A letter to Max Brod 1941 says: "General and Indian Ethnology for the layman". 
The situation in India changed at the outbreak of World War II September 1939. Austrian passports were considered "German" from March 1938. The war meant that antifascist refugee Umar Rolf Ehrenfels was now an "enemy alien". Ehrenfels was deprived of his liberty until 1946 in two British India [[internment camps]] most of the time at [[Yercaud]], a hill station. He managed to do some anthropological fieldwork - under police escort. He learnt languages and created art as he was a painter, having his first exhibitions in Prague and Vienna.

== Respected in India .. and East Africa ==
In 1949 Ehrenfels lectured before the Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] (1889–1964) and got an honorary Indian citizenship. He was awarded the Sarat Chandra Roy Golden Medal for original contributions to Anthropology by the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;Jettmar, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ehrenfels had suffered hardships as a British Empire political prisoner like other freedom fighters. A forced exile had brought him back as the Nizam's guest but he became an active builder of the new republic. He used anthropology with a historical and interdisciplinary outlook to strengthen the self-esteem of Indians particularly women. He wrote many anthropological articles and gave radio talks. He took part in social work. Always infused with his passion for women's rights, not only in theory but in implementation in real life.&lt;ref name="Hackzell"/&gt; 
In 1949–1961 Ehrenfels was head and professor of the Department of Anthropology, founded in 1945, at Madras University.&lt;ref&gt;Vidyarthi, 1978. Writes Ehrenfel.&lt;/ref&gt; He held several grants from the Viking Fund, New York and did field work reinforcing the theories he had presentad in his dissertation 1937. In 1957–58 he held a Swedish grant to make his longed for field work in East Africa, described in the bok ''The Light Continent'' (1960), translated into German and Telugu: ''Kaanti Seema''.

== Back in Europe ==
From Madras Ehrenfels and his newly wed wife Mireielle Ehrenfels moved to Heidelberg in 1961. Together they went to do a last fieldwork in India in the mid 60s. Apart from a book in 1969 there is a great amount of unpublished material in the Lichtenau archive. After her husband's death Mireille Ehrenfels made Lichtenau her home. She made great efforts in restoring the Lichtenau and Rastbach castles after the damages during the war as well as organising the Ehrenfels Archive.

== Dress codes ==
A recurrent theme in Ehrenfels' writings from the early 1920s was dress codes and women's rights.
Ehrenfels insisted that both men and women should stick to the pre- colonial traditions of the tropics which was to leave the upper part of the body uncovered. Ehrenfels lived as he taught and adjusted his dress to the climate but he could only do so in private. In British India there was legislation punishing non- indigenous men for "disgracing European dignity" by wearing the [[dhoti]].
In 1973 the International Anthropological and Ethnological Congress [[IUAES]] was held in Chicago presided by Professor ''' Sol Tax ''' (1907–1995). [[Sol Tax]] Dr. Ehrenfels' paper Clothing and Power Abuse was printed in two of the congress volumes. 1975 in ''War: Its Causes and Correlates''. Part 2: Psychological and psychiatric considerations of the etiology of war p.&amp;nbsp;157-61. 1979 in ''''' The Fabrics of Culture: The Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment ''''' p.&amp;nbsp;399-404. Professor Sol Tax presented the 1973 congress in Chicago as the first of the decolonization era and demanded peace research to be a worldwide commitment ever after. The next IUAES congress in 1978 was for the first time held in the third world, in New Delhi, India, presided by ''' Lalita Prasad Vidyarthi ''' (1931–1985) [[L. P. Vidyarthi]]

He appears both in the aspect as a Muslim and Islamologist and as a Vienna University trained professional social scientist working at Madras University (1949–61) and Heidelberg University (1961 – c. 1975) doing scientific, published fieldwork in South Asia 1932–1964. The [[World Catalog]] http://worldcat.org database, although only primary, leads to several titles.
Most of Ehrenfels' articles written for the Moslemische Revue in Berlin can now be read http://berlin.ahmadiyya.org/m-rev/index.htm This is the only genuine journal published in by the Berlin Mosque. The name was taken by others later.
Umar Rolf Ehrenfels is included in the book ''''' Islam Our Choice ''''' first edition May 1961 is online. http://aaiil.org/text/books/kk/islamourchoicemuslimconvertstories/islamourchoicemuslimconvertstories.pdf Dr. Ehrenfels expressed his Muslim faith as it had crystallized over the years in the article The How and Why of Conversion to Islam published in June, 1961 in the Islamic Review, Woking. http://www.wokingmuslim.org/work/islamic_review/index.htm A fact box contains his life story. In 1967 the article was translated into German published in the Al Muslim, Frankfurt/M. 
By that time Dr. Ehrenfels' work at the Heidelberg University South Asia Institute as a guest professor employed as a senior research fellow Ehrenfels had made him move even further. From his conversion on he saw Islam as a world-encompassing unifying link of mankind. Over the years he deepened his understanding and experiencing other religious forms into sharing the mystical oneness.

After his escape from the Nazi terror in Austria after March 1938, Ehrenfels was received as the Guest of the Nizam's Government thanks to Sir Akbar Haydari. In 1939 Ehrenfels wrote "Indian and general anthropology for the layman", a two volume textbook for the students of anthropology he was planned to have at the [[Osmania University]] in Hyderabad. It was translated into Urdu, the educational language of the university, as ''''' Ilmul Aqvam ''''' 280 + 197 printed pages. It was published in Delhi by a'njuman e taraq y e a'rdv dhly in December 1941. Digitisation was made October 22, 2010. The Urdu translator's name say ad 'a'bid h'usain was by mistake given as the author's name.
The Hyderabad textbook '' Ilmul Aqvam '' written by Dr. Ehrenfels can now be read online by Urdu readers all over the world. For some reason the [[University of Wisconsin]] Library at Madison has a copy of '' Ilmul Aqvam ''. The author's name is there given as Daktar Bairan Umar Ralf Ehranfels and the translator as Daktar Sayyid Husain Sahib.

== Early life and education ==
Bimal Patel lives and practices architecture and city planning in [[Ahmedabad]], India. Ahmedabad is also the city that he grew up in and its architectural history and planning culture have influenced and informed his work. He studied at the [[School of Architecture Ahmedabad|School of Architecture]], Center for Environmental Planning and Technology, CEPT, from 1978 to 1984.  In 1981, he apprenticed with [[Frei Otto]] at the Institute for Lightweight Structures, Stuttgart, Germany.  Living and working in Stuttgart also gave him the opportunity to travel through much of Western Europe at a young age.

After receiving his first professional degree in architecture from CEPT in 1984 and a year of work in Ahmedabad, Bimal Patel moved to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] to study at the [[UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design|College of Environmental Design, CED]]. He graduated with M.Arch. and M.C.P. degrees in 1988 and a Ph.D. from the Department of City and Regional Planning in 1995.  He worked closely with [[Allan Jacobs|Prof. Allan Jacobs]], [[Donlyn Lyndon|Prof. Donlyn Lyndon]], [[Manuel Castells|Prof. Manuel Castells]] and [http://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/faculty-staff/michael-teitz Prof. Mike Teitz] at the CED and Prof. Richard Walker of the Geography Department.  UC Berkeley and the openness of CED provided him with the opportunity and freedom for intellectual exploration beyond the confines of Architecture and City Planning.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;

== Career ==
While still working on his Ph.D. dissertation, Bimal Patel returned to India in 1990 and joined his father’s architectural practice. One of his first building design projects, a campus for [[Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India|The Entrepreneurship Development Institute]], Ahmedabad, won the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akdn.org/architecture/project.asp?id=1240|title=Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India - Aga Khan Development Network|website=www.akdn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000 he was selected to build the New Campus for the [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad|Indian Institute of Management]], Ahmedabad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indian-architects.com/en/hcpdpm/projects-3/new_campus_for_iima-29706|title=HCPDPM - Ahmedabad, India - Architects -|website=Indian-Architects}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/the-shape-of-an-icon-110062700047_1.html|title=The shape of an icon|first=Business|last=Standard|date=27 June 2010|publisher=|via=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years he has built up a significant body of architectural and urban design work ranging from single family homes, to institutions, industrial buildings and urban redevelopment projects. HCPDPM the firm that he heads has won numerous awards for its projects. Urban design projects, like the [[Kankaria|Kankaria Lake]] Development, are the first of their kind in the country.&lt;ref name="hcp.co.in"/&gt;&lt;ref name="german-architects.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indian-architects.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patel |first=Bimal |url=http://forbesindia.com/article/independence-special-2013/bimal-patel-we-have-to-free-our-cities-from-the-states-clutches/35885/1 |title=Bimal Patel: We Have to Free Our Cities from the State's Clutches |publisher=Forbes India |date=2013-08-16 |accessdate=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Bimal Patel founded Environmental Planning Collaborative. EPC, a not-for-profit company to work with local governments on city planning and continues to head the company today.  EPC was one of the very first non-government organizations in India to successfully work with government on statutory planning and one that has participated in the rejuvenation of city planning in a variety of ways.  Its projects include organizing workshops and seminars, preparing statutory urban and regional plans, developing coursework for planners, managing development projects, undertaking research and advocating causes.  Some of EPC’s significant projects are the Development Plan for Ahmedabad (2002), Development Plan and Town Planning Schemes for the reconstruction of Bhuj, Kachchh after the earthquake of 2001 and Reformulating Planning Legislation for Delhi.  In 1998, [[UNCHS]] Global 100 Best Practices Award commended EPC for its revitalization plan for Surat’s inner city.  In 2003 EPC’s work on the [[Sabarmati Riverfront]] Development Project won the Prime Minister’s Award for Excellence in Urban Design and Planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabarmatiriverfront.com/maps-documents/riverfront-redevelopment|title=Riverfront Redevelopment - SABARMATI|website=www.sabarmatiriverfront.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=VE9JQS8yMDEyLzA3LzAxI0FyMDAzMDI=|title=Bimal Patel new president of Cept|website=epaper.timesofindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecosuite.ambujaneotia.com/our-architect.aspx?chk=1|title=Untitled Document|website=ecosuite.ambujaneotia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionopportunities.in/IssueDetailPage?IssueMenuMasterId=117&amp;ParentMenuId=92&amp;ContentType=SubParent|title=Construction Magazine,Construction Equipment Magazine|website=www.constructionopportunities.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaastuyogam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/1+2+3+4+5+6+7.pdf |title=1+2+3+4+5+6+7.cdr |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Patel is President of CEPT University in Ahmedabad. CEPT University focuses on understanding, designing, planning, constructing and managing human habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-bimal-patel-to-shape-cept-now-1709057|title=Bimal Patel to shape Cept now|date=1 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/cept-gets-new-prinicpal/|title=CEPT gets new prinicpal|date=1 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work there involves academics as well as institutional leadership and development.

==Background and early career==
Hazzard was educated at Manly Boys' High School (now [[Manly Selective Campus]]), [[Macquarie University]] where he gained a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (Science) and a [[Diploma of Education]], the [[University of New South Wales]] where he graduated [[Bachelor of Laws]], and the [[University of Sydney]] where he graduated [[Master of Laws]]. Hazzard was then employed as a science teacher (1974-1977) before being admitted as a solicitor in 1977. He was a partner in a Manly law firm from 1981 to 1996.&lt;ref name=nswpl/&gt;

==Political career==
In 1983, Hazzard joined the Liberal Party and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming regional president and a member of the state executive from 1985 to 1986.&lt;ref name=nswpl/&gt; Hazzard was pre-selected as Liberal Party candidate for Wakehurst in April 1991, ahead of the sitting Liberal Party member [[John David Booth|John Booth]]. He was elected to NSW Legislative Assembly in [[New South Wales state election, 1991|1991]] and sat in the backbench during the [[Nick Greiner|Greiner]] and [[John Fahey (politician)|Fahey]] governments.&lt;ref name=brad/&gt;

Hazzard played a role in the '[[Terry Metherell#The "Metherell Affair" and resignation|Metherell affair]]', involving the neighbouring Member for [[Electoral district of Davidson|Davidson]], [[Terry Metherell]], who upon his resignation from the Liberal Party had expressed to Hazzard his interest in one of the Directorships at the new Environmental Protection Authority. Hazzard discussed this with Premier Greiner and the Minister for the Environment, [[Tim Moore (Australian politician)|Tim Moore]], at Greiner's residence in February 1992. Greiner and Hazzard then discussed the matter with Metherell while in Parliament ten days later.&lt;ref name=lib&gt;{{cite book | first = Ian | last = Hancock | title = The Liberals: a history of the NSW division of the Liberal party | publisher = The Federation Press

At the [[Davidson state by-election, 1992|May 1992 by-election]] the Labor Party did not nominate a candidate, and a field of Independents and minor parties reduced the Liberal vote by 16 points (14 points after preferences), nevertheless won by Liberal candidate [[Andrew Humpherson]].&lt;ref name="date"&gt;{{cite news

===NSW Opposition===
After the Labor party won the 1995 election, Hazzard was appointed to the Opposition frontbench and held various shadow portfolios. Under Opposition Leader [[Peter Collins (New South Wales politician)|Peter Collins]], Hazzard was Shadow Minister for Corrective and Emergency Services (1995–96), Environment (1996-1997), Aboriginal Affairs (1996-2007), and Sport and Recreation (1997–99)&lt;ref name=nswpl/&gt; Under [[Kerry Chikarovski]] he was Shadow Minister for Housing (1999-2000), Corrective Services (1999-2000), Disability Services and Ageing (2000–03), and Community Services (2000–03). Under [[John Brogden (politician)|John Brogden]] he was Shadow Minister for Energy and Utilities (2003–05), Science and Medical Research (2003–05), Youth (2005), and Community Services (2005).&lt;ref name=nswpl/&gt;

Under [[Peter Debnam]] and [[Barry O'Farrell]] he was Shadow Minister for Education (2005–07) and was made Shadow Minister for Redfern Waterloo (2007–08). He was also appointed Shadow Minister for Planning (2008–11) and Shadow Minister for Infrastructure (2008–11).&lt;ref name=nswpl/&gt; Between 2007 and 2011 Hazzard criticised the State Labor Government's move to take planning powers away from Local government and handing them to government-appointed planning panels and their attitudes towards development of heritage areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =NSW Opposition angry at plan to remove more council planning powers | publisher =Livenews.com.au | url =http://livenews.com.au/news/nsw-opposition-angry-at-plan-to-remove-more-council-planning-powers/2009/5/30/208297 | accessdate =21 June 2009 | date = | work = | author = }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011 Hazzard was appointed Minister for Planning and Infrastructure and Minister Assisting the Premier on [[Infrastructure NSW]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2286">'''Certified MBA''' ('''CMBA''') was a [[professional certification]] designed as an "objective measure of a student's grasp of the [[MBA]] skill set". It was offered by the International Certification Institute.

The CMBA focused on the "10 key subject areas" comprising the MBA "[[MBA#Content|core curriculum]]"  ([[Financial Accounting]], [[Management Accounting]], [[Quantitative analysis (finance)|Quantitative Analysis]], [[Microeconomics]], [[Macroeconomics]], [[Finance]], [[Marketing Management]], [[Operations Management]], [[Organizational Behavior]], and [[Business Strategy]]). The certification was a series of exams taken over several days.  Each four-hour exam focused on several of the subject areas and was composed of [[multiple choice question]]s. The exams were administered by [[Prometric]].

The certification was incorporated into the [[Western Governors University]] MBA program  for several years.&lt;ref name="MBAPDF"&gt;{{cite book |title=MBA BA |publisher=Western Govenors University |url=http://www.wgu.edu/wgu/prog_guide/MBA_BA.pdf |accessdate=3 November 2018 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13345">'''Cognitive apprenticeship''' is a [[theory]] that emphasizes the importance of the process in which a master of a skill teaches that skill to an [[apprentice]].

[[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|Constructivist]] approaches to human [[learning]] have led to the development of the theory of cognitive apprenticeship.&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;Collins, A., Brown, J. S., &amp; Newman, S. E. (1987). Cognitive apprenticeship: Teaching the craft of reading, writing and mathematics (Technical Report No. 403). BBN Laboratories, Cambridge, MA. Centre for the Study of Reading, University of Illinois. January, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, J. S., Collins, A., &amp; Duguid, P. (1989). Situated cognition and the culture of learning. Educational Researcher, 18, 32-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  This theory accounts for the problem that masters of a skill often fail to take into account the implicit processes involved in carrying out complex skills when they are teaching novices.  To combat these tendencies, [[cognitive]] apprenticeships "…are designed, among other things, to bring these tacit processes into the open, where students can observe, enact, and practice them with help from the teacher…".&lt;ref name="Collins" /&gt;  This model is supported by [[Albert Bandura]]'s (1997) theory of modeling, which posits that in order for modeling to be successful, the learner must be attentive, access and retain the information presented, be motivated to learn, and be able to accurately reproduce the desired skill.

==Overview==
Part of the effectiveness of the cognitive apprenticeship model comes from learning in context and is based on theories of [[situated cognition]]. Cognitive scientists maintain that the context in which learning takes place is critical (e.g., Godden &amp; Baddeley, 1975). Based on findings such as these, Collins, Duguid, and Brown (1989) argue that cognitive apprenticeships are less effective when skills and concepts are taught independently of their real-world context and situation.  As they state, "Situations might be said to co-produce knowledge through activity.  Learning and cognition, it is now possible to argue, are fundamentally situated".&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;  In cognitive apprenticeships, teachers model their skills in real-world situations.

By modelling and coaching, masters in cognitive apprenticeships also support the three stages of skill acquisition described in the expertise literature: the cognitive stage, the associative stage, and the [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] stage.&lt;ref name="Ander"&gt;Anderson, J.R. (1983).  The architecture of cognition.  Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitts"&gt;Fitts, P.M., &amp; Posner, M.I. (1967). Human performance.  Belmont, CA: Brooks Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the cognitive stage, learners develop a declarative understanding of the skill.  In the associative stage, mistakes and misinterpretations learned in the cognitive stage are detected and eliminated, while associations between the critical elements involved in the skill are strengthened.  Finally, in the autonomous stage, the learner's skill becomes honed and perfected until it is executed at an expert level.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson, J.R. (2000). Cognitive psychology and its implications.  New York, NY: Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like traditional apprenticeships, in which the apprentice learns a trade such as [[tailoring]] or [[woodworking]] by working under a master teacher, cognitive apprenticeships allow masters to model behaviors in a real-world context with cognitive modeling.&lt;ref name="Bandura"&gt;Bandura, A. (1997).  Social Learning Theory.  Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  After listening to the master explain exactly what they are doing and thinking as they model the skill, the apprentice identifies relevant behaviors and develops a conceptual model of the processes involved.  The apprentice then attempts to imitate those behaviors as the master observes and coaches.  Coaching provides assistance at the most critical level– the skill level just beyond what the learner/apprentice could accomplish by themself.  [[Vygotsky]] (1978) referred to this as the [[Zone of Proximal Development]] and believed that fostering development within this zone would lead to the most rapid development.  The coaching process includes providing additional modeling as necessary, giving corrective feedback, and giving reminders, which all intend to bring the apprentice's performance closer to that of the master's.  As the apprentice becomes more skilled through the repetition of this process, the feedback and instruction provided by the master "fades" until the apprentice is, ideally, performing the skill at a close approximation of the master level.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, S.D. (1992).  A framework for technology education curricula which emphasizes intellectual processes.  Journal of Technology Education, 3; 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[This entry is an excerpt from R. Shawn Edmondson's doctoral dissertation, entitled Evaluating the Effectiveness of a Telepresence-Enabled Cognitive Apprenticeship Model of Teacher Professional Development (2006).]

==Teaching methods==
[[Allan M. Collins|Collins]], [[John Seely Brown|Brown]], and Newman developed six teaching methods rooted in cognitive apprenticeship theory and claim these methods help students attain cognitive and [[Metacognition|metacognitive]] strategies for "using, managing, and discovering knowledge".&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; The first three, modeling, coaching, scaffolding, are at the core of cognitive apprenticeship and help with cognitive and metacognitive development. The next two, articulation and reflection, are designed to help novices with awareness of problem-solving strategies and execution similar to that of an expert. The final step, exploration, intends to guide the novice towards independence and the ability to solve and identify problems within the domain on their own. The authors note, however, that this is not an exhaustive list of methods and that the successful execution of these methods is highly dependent on the domain.&lt;ref name="Collins" /&gt;

===Modeling===
Modeling is when an expert, usually a teacher, within the cognitive domain or subject area demonstrates a task explicitly so that novices, usually a student, can experience and build a [[conceptual model]] of the task at hand. For example, a math teacher might write out explicit steps and work through a problem aloud, demonstrating their [[heuristics]] and [[procedural knowledge]]. Modeling includes demonstrating expert performances or processes in the world.

===Coaching===
Coaching involves observing a novice's task performance and offering feedback and hints to sculpt the novice's performance to that of an expert's. The expert oversees the novice's tasks and may structure the task accordingly to assist the novice's development.

===Scaffolding===
[[Instructional scaffolding]] is the act of applying strategies and methods to support the student's learning. These supports could be teaching manipulatives, activities, or group work. The teacher may have to execute parts of the task that the student is not yet able to do. This requires the teacher to have the skill to analyze and assess students' abilities in the moment.

===Articulation===
Articulation includes "any method of getting students to articulate their knowledge, reasoning, or problem-solving process in a domain" (p.&amp;nbsp;482).&lt;ref name="Collins" /&gt; Three types of articulation are inquiry teaching, thinking aloud, and critical student role. Through inquiry teaching (Collins &amp; Stevens, 1982), teachers ask students a series of questions that allow them to refine and restate their learned knowledge and form explicit conceptual models. Thinking aloud requires students to articulate their thoughts while solving problems. Students assuming a critical role monitor others in cooperative activities and draw conclusions based on the problem-solving activities. Articulation is described by McLellan&lt;ref name="McLellan"&gt;McLellan, H. (1994). Situated learning: Continuing the conversation. Educational Technology 34, 7- 8.&lt;/ref&gt; as consisting of two aspects: separating component knowledge from skills to learn more effectively, and more commonly verbalizing or demonstrating knowledge and thinking processes in order to expose and clarify ideas.

===Reflection===
Reflection allows students to "compare their own problem-solving processes with those of an expert, another student, and ultimately, an internal cognitive model of expertise" (p.&amp;nbsp;483).&lt;ref name="Collins" /&gt; A technique for reflection would be examining the past performances of both an expert and a novice, and highlighting similarities and differences. The goal of reflection is for students to look back and analyze their performances with desire to understand and improve the behavior of an expert.

===Exploration===
Exploration involves giving students room to problem solve on their own and teaching students exploration strategies. The former requires the teacher to slowly withdraw the use of supports and scaffolds not only in problem solving methods, but problem setting methods as well. The latter requires the teacher to show students how to explore, research, and develop hypotheses. Exploration allows the student to frame interesting problems within the domain for themselves and then take the initiative to solve these problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3921">'''Colegio Tarbut''' ({{lang-he|בית ספר תרבות}}) is a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[mixed-sex education|mixed-sex]] [[private school]] founded in 1961 in the city of [[Olivos, Buenos Aires Province|Olivos]], [[Buenos Aires Province]], [[Argentina]]. It offers [[early childhood education|early childhood]], [[primary education|primary]], and [[secondary education|secondary]] education. In September 2005 it was identified as among Argentina's most expensive schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Iglesias |first=Mariana |date=18 September 2005 |title=Cómo es el pequeño mundo de la educación de elite |trans-title=How the small world of elite education is |url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2005/09/18/sociedad/s-04615.htm |newspaper=Clarín |language=Spanish |location=Buenos Aires |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206214911/http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2005/09/18/sociedad/s-04615.htm |archive-date=6 February 2012 |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution comprises a school in Olivos and two kindergartens in [[Belgrano, Buenos Aires|Belgrano]] and [[Tigre, Buenos Aires Province|Tigre]]. Colegio Tarbut finished building a new secondary school in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of [[Núñez, Buenos Aires|Núñez]], which opened in 2016.

==Pedagogy==
Colegio Tarbut is named after the [[Tarbut]] movement of humanistic Jewish education and has much in common with that movement's curricular philosophy. The school offers a trilingual education in which [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[English language|English]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are taught.

The focus on academics has ensured that the majority of the graduated students pursue university studies. The school offers their pupils the opportunity to obtain the [[IB Diploma Programme]] (IBDP) of the [[International Baccalaureate]] foundation, the PET (Preliminary English Test) examination and the IGCSE examination, both from Cambridge University.

In tenth grade, in secondary school, you can choose an orientation in order to give an IGCSE examination on that subject. The orientations include Visual Arts, Business Studies, Social Studies and since 2015, Science.

==Traditions==
===Yom Sport===
During the last months of the school year, usually October or November, an annual Yom Sport (Hebrew for "Sports Day") is held in which students compete in individual ([[sprint (running)|sprinting]], [[shot put]], and [[long jump|long]] and [[high jump]]) and group sports ([[association football]] and [[handball]]). Students are divided into four teams, namely red, green, yellow and blue, and stay in the same team every year. Competitions in the group disciplines are done according to the teams. Athletics records are kept between years.

Some weeks after the Yom Sport another event is held in which winners in the individual events are announced and team rankings are published. Team rankings are computed according to the performance of the team members in the individual and group disciplines.

===Religious services===
During the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[High Holy Days]] the school holds religious services usually attended by current students, their families, and former alumni.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2210">'''Domenico Foroni''' (10 July 1796 - 24 March 1853) was an Italian [[composer]], [[conducting|conductor]], and music educator. He was born in [[Valeggio sul Mincio]] into a family of landowners. On 7 November 1818 he married Teresa Zovetto with whom he had five children, two of whom became famous: the [[opera]]tic [[soprano]] [[Antonietta Foroni-Conti]] (1822-187?) and the composer and conductor [[Jacopo Foroni]] (1825–1858). In 1818 he was appointed to the dual position of director and principal conductor of the [[Teatro Filarmonico]] in [[Verona]], a position he held for over 25 years. He was also highly active as a teacher of singing and music composition in that city. Among his notable pupils were [[Gottardo Aldighieri]], [[Paolo Bombardi]], [[Domenico Conti]], [[Carlo Pedrotti]], [[Alessandro Sala]], [[Maria Spezia-Aldighieri]], and his children. Most of his compositional output was sacred music, the majority of which was written for services at the [[Verona Cathedral]]. Most of his music is now lost, but copies of his ''[[Psalm 51|Miserere]]'' and ''[[Mass (music)|Messe]]'' still exist

In 1848 Foroni participated actively in the [[First Italian War of Independence]] as a member of the secret committee of Veronese patriots. On three occasions he provided the Piedmontese minister of war a detailed plan for the taking the city of Verona, but the negligence and incompetence of [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]]'s generals and other staff members led to their failure on acting upon the intelligence he provided. Ultimately the first war of independence ended in a stalemate. He died in Verona in 1853.

The '''EDUindex''' is a [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Correlation coefficient]] representing the relevancy of [[Curriculum]] to post-educational objectives, particularly [[employability]].  An EDUindex [[Gap analysis|Gap Analysis]] provides missing, relevant curriculum relative to employment opportunity within a representative area. Representative areas may include geographic [[regions]], [[U.S. state|states]], [[cities]], [[school districts]] or specific schools.  Analysis is regularly conducted using [[zip code]] sets.

In 1918, [[John Franklin Bobbitt]] said that curriculum, as an idea, has its roots in the Latin word for horse race-course, explaining the curriculum as the course of deeds and experiences through which children become the adults they should be, for success in adult society. 
EDUindex, Inc. developed the EDUindex to identify and promote [[relevance]] in education.

The EDUindex is a correlation of curricular subjects taught in a particular school to skills as suggested by a pre-defined or custom selected target marketplace. Published class offerings represent the skills taught.  [http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=IES1982218 The Classification of Secondary School Courses] (CSSC) provides a general inventory of courses taught nationwide in the secondary school level (grades 9 through 12).   Further detail is provided by [http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hst/ High School Transcript Studies] provided by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]].  Public, Charter, and Private School listings are accessed per geographical area to create a comprehensive data set of all schools and businesses within the analytical focus.  Curriculum per School, District, etc. is published individually and is publicly available.

Standard databases like the [[North American Industry Classification System|North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)]] provide defined business focus.  Business focus can be further refined into specific occupations and skill sets using [[Standard Occupational Classification System]] (SOC).  Together these datasets provide information representing the skills offered and the occupational opportunities available within the designated target area.

The EDUindex, as a value, is expressed as a number from 0 to 1.0 with 1.0 representing a perfect match of curricular offering to target need.  The value is determined using the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]] (sometimes referred to as the PMCC, and typically denoted by r) as a measure of the correlation ([[linear dependence]]) between two variables X and Y, giving a value between +1 and −1 inclusive. It is widely used in the sciences as a measure of the strength of linear dependence between two variables. It was developed by Karl Pearson from a similar but slightly different idea introduced by [[Francis Galton]] in the 1880s. The general correlation coefficient is sometimes called "Pearson's r." The EDUindex calculates Pearson’s r for educational relevance by comparing the content of course offerings with the need for related skill sets within the same banded geographic area.  Correlative results are [[weighted]] based on data volume for [[Scalar (mathematics)|Scalar]], comparative and presentation purposes.

'''Education Media and Publishing Group''', more commonly known as '''EMPG''', is a holding company registered in the [[Cayman Islands]] with no operating subsidiaries. It also has a minority interest in an affiliate that focuses on markets outside the USA called [[EMPGI]]. In January 2009 the two big credit rating services, [[Moody's Investor Services]] and [[Standard &amp; Poor's]], reduced the rating of EMPG and warned that default on its debt was increasingly likely. On 10 April 2009 Moody's downgraded [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] down to [[Caa3]] from Caa1. In August 2009, EMPG announced that it had substantially reduced its debt, relaxed covenants and received incremental working capital facilities. Prior to March 2010, EMPG owned the legacy [[Riverdeep]] and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt businesses, which it acquired in 2006 and 2007, respectively.

==Riverdeep's acquisition of Houghton Mifflin==
On 22 December 2006, it was announced that [[Riverdeep|Riverdeep PLC]] had completed its acquisition of Houghton Mifflin.  The new joint enterprise would be called the Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep Group plc, a company based in Ireland.  Riverdeep paid $1.75&amp;nbsp;billion in cash for the equity owned the private investment firms [[Thomas H. Lee Partners]], [[Bain Capital]] and [[The Blackstone Group]] and assumed $1.61&amp;nbsp;billion in debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/12/22/irish_company_completes_houghton_mifflin_acquisition "Irish company completes Houghton Mifflin acquisition"], [[Associated Press]], 22 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Lucki, a former non-executive director of Riverdeep, remained in his position as Houghton Mifflin's chief executive officer.&lt;ref&gt;Edgecliffe-Johnson, Andrew and Peter Smith. [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/8d158afe-63c5-11db-bc82-0000779e2340.html "Riverdeep in talks over $3.5bn takeover of Houghton Mifflin"], ''Financial Times'', 25 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The merger with Harcourt==
On 16 July 2007 Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire the [[Harcourt Education]], [[Harcourt Trade]] and Greenwood-Heinemann divisions of [[Reed Elsevier]] for $4&amp;nbsp;billion. The expanded company would become Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. The holding company structure of Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep plc was re-organised with a new holding company based in the Cayman Islands. This company was called Education Media and Publishing Group, EMPG for short.

At the time of the formation of HMH Lucki said "Together, we will be better positioned to meet the changing needs of educators and students in a wider range of subjects, states and school districts".&lt;ref name="Houghton Mifflin Company to Acquire Harcourt Education and Harcourt Trade Divisions from Reed Elsevier"&gt;[http://www.hmco.com/company/investors/invest/ir_release_071607.html Houghton Mifflin Company &gt; Investors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 2008, President Jeremy Dickens told the New York Times that the company had $7bn of debt, which cost the company $500m per annum to service. The money to fund the 2006 Houghton Mifflin and 2007 Reed Elsevier acquisitions was borrowed, and in retrospect Education Media and Publishing Group (Riverdeep) probably overpaid for both companies.&lt;ref name="Publishing Displays Its Split Personality"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/books/26rich.html Publishing Displays Its Split Personality]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, [[Cengage Learning]] (formerly Thomson Learning) acquired the assets of the Houghton Mifflin College Division for $750&amp;nbsp;million.

The combined business was led by Tony Lucki, who had more than thirty years of publishing experience, until his replacement in April 2009 by [[Barry O'Callaghan]].

==Financial Reorganization==

===Downgrades in January 2009===

In January 2009 the two big credit rating services, Moody's Investor Services and Standard &amp; Poor's, reduced the rating of EMPG and warned that default on its debt was increasingly likely. On 10 April 2009 Moody's downgraded [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] down to Caa3 from Caa1.

In January 2009, Reed Elsevier dropped its valuation of their 11.8% stake in EMPG to just €15m. This values the group at around 5% of its original claimed worth, leaving Chairman Barry O'Callaghan with few options now that [[Standard &amp; Poor's|S&amp;P]] rates the group CCC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/reed-elsevier-slashes-value-of-empg-stake-1646848.html "Reed Elsevier slashes value of EMPG stake"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restructuring in August 2009===

On 27 July 2009, the [[Irish Independent]] newspaper reported that was in the process of a re-structuring negotiations with its unsecured-debt holders that would lead to the conversion of the debt into equity. The news story reported that the unsecured debt holders would receive a 45% equity stake. Dubai's royal family to buy up stake in EMPG. The article estimates that post deal, EMPG would cut its debt from $7.3bn to $6.1bn. On 15 August 2009, the [[Financial Times]] newspaper reported in an interview with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's CEO, Barry O'Callaghan, that the refinancing had received approval of more than 90% of lenders. The terms included the holding company debt converting into 45% of the fully diluted common equity, an effective 25 per cent relaxation of financial covenants, second lien lenders agreeing to convert their holdings into a PIK instrument, reducing annual interest costs by $100m, and a further $50m increase its working capital facility.&lt;ref name="EMPG refinancing will cut $7.6bn debt"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/defa4846-8933-11de-b50f-00144feabdc0.html EMPG refinancing will cut $7.6bn debt]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Following the announcement of the debt restructuring, the President of EMPG, Jeremy Dickens, previously a lawyer at Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, stepped down as President of EMPG.&lt;ref name="Jeremy Dickens Steps Down From Education Media Post"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125243699352993277 Jeremy Dickens Steps Down From Education Media Post]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September 2009, the [[Irish Independent]] newspaper reported that a circular was posted to shareholders of EMPG with details of the restructuring, including an update on financial performance and a new management incentive plan.&lt;ref name="EMPG chiefs to end up with 10pc of publisher Post"&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/empg-chiefs-to-end-up-with-10pc--of-publisher-1882358.html EMPG chiefs to end up with 10pc of publisher]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the article it stated that EMPG's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 18pc in 2008 to $750m. Although the article indicated that the outlook for 2009 is uncertain, it highlights that [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] has won a 52% market share in all new adoptions in the first half of 2009.

===Rumored Shareholder Wipe-out===

On 13 January 2010, Irish politician, [[George Lee (Irish politician)|George Lee]],&lt;ref name="George Lee's parliamentary homepage"&gt;[http://www.georgelee.finegael.org/"George Lee's parliamentary homepage]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the opposition party, [[Fine Gael]]'s TD for Dublin South, told journalists that EMPG has failed with equity investors likely to be wipe-out and the Irish taxpayer was exposed since the nationalised bank, [[Anglo Irish Bank]] has lent money to the shareholders of EMPG.&lt;ref name="EMPG shareholders face wipeout in bondholder deal"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130108041531/http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/empg-shareholders-face-wipeout-in-bondholder-deal-2012954.html EMPG shareholders face wipeout in bondholder deal]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Commented Lee
{{cquote|It has been reported to me that the education materials company Houghton Mifflin Harcourt has failed, and that a number of Irish equity investors have lost significant sums of money as a result. Many of these investors were funded through large loans from Anglo Irish Bank, which is now wholly owned by Irish taxpayers.

As a company, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt was a highly leveraged operation and had very significant banking commitments. I understand that the remaining US business is to be transferred to its bond holders. However, it appears that its Irish equity investors will lose all of their investment as a result of this failure. This will have repercussions for Anglo Irish Bank, and possibly other Irish banks, and therefore the Irish taxpayer.

This incident adds further weight to Fine Gael's calls for an urgent investigation into the Irish banking crisis. Fuller details of the goings-on within Anglo Irish Bank's risky lending practices are still emerging, and this development with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt sheds further light. However, only a full, forensic investigation into the crisis will ensure that it never happens again.&lt;ref name="Quote of George Lee on EMPG failure"&gt;

EMPG confirmed that it was in advanced negotiations with its lenders about a comprehensive restructuring, that could see a 70% reduction in the current debt levels that would lead to [[Paulson &amp; Co.]], a hedge fund, becoming the largest shareholder. According to the [[Financial Times]], second lien investors had not yet approved the plan which would see half of the $5bn of first-lien debt convert into circa 90% of the equity of [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]], with the remaining equity for the $2bn second lien investors and the old EMPG shareholders.&lt;ref name="EMPG pushes for financial shake-up"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/80ee0426-00ad-11df-ae8d-00144feabdc0.html EMPG pushes for financial shake-up]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Financial Times story indicated that Houghton Mifflin Harcourt was considering a pre-packaged bankruptcy if the negotiations with lenders were not approved.

According to the [[Irish Times]], investors of [[Davy Stockbrokers]] had $475m of equity in EMPG.&lt;ref name="EMPG expects $600m from restructuring plan"&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2010/0114/1224262292401.html EMPG expected $600m from restructuring plan]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the statement of George Lee that Irish taxpayers were exposed, an Anglo Irish Bank spokesperson was reported by the Irish Times to state that it did not have a “big exposure” to EMPG. However, the spokesperson did not comment on whether it has exposure to individuals that have exposure to EMPG.

Interviewed on Irish State broadcaster, [[RTÉ]], [[Barry O'Callaghan]], Chairman on EMPG and CEO of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, confirmed that Irish investors as well as he himself were facing huge losses.&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan confirms huge losses on EMPG"&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0114/empg-business.html O'Callaghan confirms huge losses on EMPG]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that "no-one has lost more than me". According to the Irish Independent, Barry O'Callaghan is a large personal customer of Anglo Irish Bank.&lt;ref name="EMPG shareholders face wipeout in bondholder deal"/&gt; The article stated that Barry O'Callaghan may be forced to step down once the restructuring package was agreed. This contrasted with his interview with the [[Financial Times]] where he insisted that he would continue to run the business.

===Recapitalization and Restructuring===

On 22 February 2010, [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] announced that EMPG and HMH had reached an agreement to restructure the finances of the company and recapitalise its balance sheet with a substantial fresh cash investment by institutional investors.&lt;ref name="Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Secures New $650-Million Cash Investment and Recapitalizes Balance Sheet in Historic Restructuring"&gt;[http://www.hmhco.com/news/20100222_news_release.html Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Secures New $650-Million Cash Investment and Recapitalizes Balance Sheet in Historic Restructuring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419163642/http://www.hmhco.com/news/20100222_news_release.html |date=19 April 2010 }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement, supported by 100% of HMH's creditors, closed on 9 March 2010. Highlights of the agreement included a reduction in the senior debt to $3&amp;nbsp;billion from the current $5&amp;nbsp;billion, with new equity issued to the senior debt holders (including Paulson &amp; Co., Guggenheim Partners),&lt;ref name="Houghton Owner Restructures Debt"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704454304575081652306551196? Houghton Owner Restructures Debt]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; conversion of the $2&amp;nbsp;billion mezzanine debt into equity and warrant, receipt of $650m of new cash from the sale of new equity. In addition to the key highlights, HMH formed a new $100m Innovation Fund to invest in the next generation of technology for the education industry.

According to the Irish Times&lt;ref name="EMPG agrees $650m cash injection"&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2010/0223/1224265034016.html EMPG agrees $650m cash injection]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the investments by the current equity holders of EMPG, including HMH's CEO, [[Barry O'Callaghan]], private clients of [[Davy Stockbrokers]], Reed Elsevier, [[Istithmar]] and others, would see their investment of over $3.5&amp;nbsp;billion written down to zero. Following the restructuring, the investors of EMPG retained a nominal investment in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt via warrants over 5% of the company if it exceeded the $10&amp;nbsp;billion valuation&lt;ref name="EMPG restructuring an end for old order"&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/empg-restructuring-an-end-for-old-order-2074843.html EMPG restructuring an end for old order]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; placed on the company at the time of the merger between Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep and Harcourt. In addition to the warrants in HMH, the EMPG shareholders continue to own a stake in the international investment vehicle, [[EMPGI]] which has stakes in China, the Middle East and elsewhere.

After the recapitalization, both the CEO, [[Barry O'Callaghan]] and the CFO, Michael Muldowney, remained in their roles. A new nine-member board was created with the CEO the only executive representative, one independent, two representative of [[Paulson &amp; Co.]], and one director from each of [[Apollo Global Management|Apollo Management]], [[BlackRock]], [[Guggenheim Partners]], [[Fidelity Investments]], and [[Avenue Capital]].

On 10 March 2010, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced that it had completed its re-capitalization.&lt;ref name="Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Announces Successful Completion of Balance Sheet Recapitalization"&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/boston10/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20100310005207&amp;newsLang=en Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Announces Successful Completion of Balance Sheet Recapitalization]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a new investment of $650&amp;nbsp;million of equity, the debt levels of the company were reduced by approximately 60% and the annual interest payments by over 75%. According to the Irish State Broadcaster, [[RTÉ]], the old equity investors based in Ireland has lost all their investment.&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan firm completes debt deal"&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0310/epmg-business.html O'Callaghan firm completes debt deal]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Irish Independent]] reported that the old shareholders were denied a shareholders meeting to vote on discuss the restructuring.&lt;ref name="Shareholder anger over EMPG deal"&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/shareholder-anger-over-empg-deal-2095087.html Shareholder anger over EMPG deal]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The former shareholders have been left with warrants over 5% of the company, in the case its value recovers to previous levels.

The State of '''[[Kuwait]]''', located at the head of the [[Persian Gulf]], supports an '''educational policy''' that seeks to provide opportunity to all children, irrespective of their [[social class]], including children with [[special needs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibe.unesco.org/National_Reports/ICE_2008/kuwait_NR08.pdf
|title= State of Kuwait,  Ministry of Education."National Report on the Development of Education 2004-2008." pp15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuwait was ranked 63rd on the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) report for 2011 by UNDP, placing Kuwait above the regional average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/KWT.html
|title= United Nations,Human Development Indicators Country Profile}}&lt;/ref&gt; The education system in Kuwait has celebrated  several achievements; in the year ending 2006, thirteen percent of all public expenditure was given to education, comparable to many [[OECD]] countries, although lower than other Arab nations. As a percentage of [[GDP]], at 3.9 percent, it remains well below the OECD average.

In 2005, the [[literacy rate]] of [[Kuwait]] was 94 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ku.html
|title= CIA World Factbook. Based on 2005 census}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''[[Kuwait]]''' is striving to improve the quality of its education at all levels and for all ages. The Ministry of Education is also making efforts to incorporate women into the educated workforce through various programs; for instance, the 1989 initiative to establish daytime literacy clinics for women.&lt;ref name="kuwaitculture.com"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kuwaitculture.com/About%20Us/today.htm

==History of education in Kuwait==

Kuwait is a small country situated in the [[Persian Gulf]]. It is one of the high-income countries with a [[GDP]] per capita of above $24,000. [[Petroleum|Oil]] exports account for nearly half of Kuwait’s national income and about 80% of government revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=   Kuwait Education Indicators Report 2007,pp4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1975 and 1985, the proportion of all working nationals employed in the public sector, including oil, rose from 76 percent to 92 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/0,,contentMDK:21617643~pagePK:146736~piPK:226340~theSitePK:256299,00.html
|title= World Bank 2008.The Road Not Travelled: Education Reform in the Middle East and North Africa.pp225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Kuwait is now looking for alternative ways to stimulate employment and the generation of income. With this in mind, it is keen to diversify and improve the skills of its labor force; hence the high priority given to the reform of education at all levels.

At the beginning of the 20th century, there was no formal educational system in place in Kuwait at all. There were a few [[Qur'an|Quranic]] schools, known as Al-Katatib, funded by the wealthy private citizens of Kuwait, that taught reading, writing and basic arithmetric. In 1911, the Al Mubarakiyya School was established as one of Kuwait’s modern educational institutions. It was founded by merchants to train their clerks in commerce, arithmetic and letter-writing skills. In 1921, the Al-Ahmedia school was established, which offered [[English language|English]] courses, and soon thereafter, an all-girls school was founded that provided education in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[home economics]] and [[Islamic Studies]]. The government became involved in providing formal education in 1936, and by 1945 there were 17 schools in Kuwait. With the increase in oil production and hence state revenues after [[World War II]], the government began investing huge sums of money into social services, including education. By 1960, there were 45,000 students enrolled in Kuwait's educational system, including 18,000 girls.

In 1965, following the constitution that made education a fundamental right of a citizen, education was made [[compulsory education|compulsory]] for children aged between 6 and 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kuwaitculture.com/About%20Us/History.htm   
|title=Embassy of the Kuwait, Cultural Office }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 21st century, the Ministry of Education has sought to prepare a general, long-term education strategy, focusing on educational teaching for the years up to 2025. This effort aims to align teaching methodologies with the current needs of an increasingly globalised world. The [[World Bank]] is conducting an analytical study to explore the various policy options needed to implement this new strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibe.unesco.org/National_Reports/ICE_2008/kuwait_NR08.pdf
|title= State of Kuwait,  Ministry of Education."National Report on the Development of Education 2004-2008." pp19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A National Conference for the Development of Education was held in Kuwait in February 2008, in order to discuss this national strategy further. Other multilateral organizations, such as the [[OECD]], are working towards improving the business environment in Kuwait and providing training for women to promote female entrepreneurship within the country.

==Demographics==
The population of Kuwait has grown rapidly in recent times, more than doubling between 1985 and 2005. Kuwaitis now make up about a third of the country’s population, expatriates the rest.&lt;ref name="britishCouncil"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britishcouncil.org/eumd-information-background-kuwait.htm |title= The British Council }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school-aged population of both Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis represented 24 percent of the total population in 2005. There were 716,000 people aged between 4 and 21 years old in Kuwait that year, of which 426,000 were Kuwaitis (representing 60 percent) and about 290,000, non–Kuwaitis. There are more males than females in every age group of the school-age population. The proportion of non-Kuwaitis is slightly higher among the 18- to 21-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Kuwait Education Indicators Report 2007,pp10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the female enrollment at primary and secondary level was 97 and 91 percent respectively, and for males, the corresponding figures were 99 and 90 percent.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Institute of Statistics" /&gt; At the same time, a burgeoning young population is posing a burden on the job market, with rising numbers of young people [[unemployment|unemployed]]. "The Government is looking at wider economic reform, including moving some of the 95 per cent of Kuwaitis who work in the state sector to the private sector",&lt;ref name="britishCouncil" /&gt; in order to increase job opportunities for the new entrants.

==Levels of education==

===School education===

The general education system consists of four levels:  [[kindergarten]], or [[Nursery school|nursery]] (lasting for 2 years), [[primary education|primary]] (lasting for 5 years), [[Middle school|intermediate]] (lasting for 4 years) and [[secondary education|secondary]] (lasting for 3 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Ministry of Education.Education Indicators in the State of Kuwait 2004-2005 report}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schooling at primary and intermediate level is compulsory for all students aged 6 – 14. All the levels of state education, including higher education, are free.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Kuwait Education  Indicators Report 2007,Executive Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main ministries involved in the development of the education sector: the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher of Education.
[[File:UIS_Literacy_Rate_Kuwait_population_plus15_1975_2015.png|thumb|UIS Literacy Rate Kuwait population plus15 1975 2015]]

There are about 1,145 schools in Kuwait, at all levels from kindergarten to secondary (2006 figures). Out of this total, 664 are public and 481 are private schools. There are 6 [[Districts of Kuwait|districts]] in Kuwait.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Kuwait education Indicators Report 2007, p 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two-thirds of all students (from kindergarten to secondary) were in public schools during the year ending 2006. Most Kuwaitis study in public schools, typically with Arabic curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;edu indicators, p 18&lt;/ref&gt; The private schools are split about equally between Arabic medium schools, which follow Kuwait’s national curriculum, and foreign language schools, which follow other curricula (e.g., American, British, French and Indian). There are currently 591,359 students enrolled in Kuwait's schools which makes up approximately 20 percent of the entire population.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Kuwait education Indicators Report 2007,pp4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2003 and 2006 there was a substantial increase in the growth of teachers, compared to the growth in students, especially at the primary level. In the year ending 2006 there was an increase of 21 percent in primary school teachers despite a decrease in student enrollments. A large proportion of public school teachers are Kuwaiti females, particularly at the primary level. Only 4 percent of women teachers are older than 45 years, compared to 35 percent of non-Kuwaiti males.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Kuwait education Indicators Report 2007,pp87}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
school aims at rehabilitating students scientifically and educationally, during the scholastic year, through remedying all learning difficulties using individual and group learning and then they can go back to their schools to continue their normal learning and educational studies with their peers at school within the frame of achieving the integrated and comprehensive growth of the student’s personality.

===Nursery and primary education===

In Kuwait, schooling usually begins at age six. Pre-school or [[nursery school|nursery]] education is also available to children from four to six years old. Under a new system, primary education will begin at age 5 years.

There is the option of attending one of the private schools, which have foreign sponsors and mostly offer co-education, whereas the Kuwaiti public schools are segregated by gender starting at the primary levels. Examples of private foreign schools in Kuwait are the British School of Kuwait (BSK), Bayan Bilingual School, the [[American School of Kuwait]], the [[New English School (Kuwait)]], the [[American International School of Kuwait]], the [[Kuwait English School]], the French School and the Canadian School of Kuwait (CSK). Private schools are not subsidised by the state. In 2007, the primary gross enrollment rate was 98.5 percent.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Institute of Statistics"&gt;{{citation|title=UNESCO Institute of Statistics }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gender parity index, which is the ratio of female enrollment to male enrollment, was 0.98. This shows parity in gender for the enrollment at primary level.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Institute of Statistics" /&gt; The percentage of Kuwaitis studying in private schools in kindergarten is 20 percent.

The Kuwaiti government puts about [[Kuwaiti Dinar|KD]]5.6 million per annum into private educational facilities, in addition to allocating land for school construction and paying for the distribution of books.{{Verify source|date=April 2013}} The Kuwait government also ensures that each school is equipped with a library. The government has focused on expanding the collection of books from 230,000 to 3 million today. The government is also promoting the use of information technology at school level. The launch of the 'Education Net' project is a manifestation of that, as it connects every government school and library in Kuwait to a telecommunications data network.&lt;ref name="kuwaitculture.com" /&gt;

===Intermediate and secondary education===

Students are required to spend 4 years at the [[Middle school|intermediate]] level, up to grade 9, after which they move on to the [[Secondary school|secondary]] level. Secondary education is for 3 years, after which students can adopt the higher education track by entering university or gaining admission into a vocational college to study for technical or vocational qualifications. The secondary education system is now being standardized from the present academic and credit system to a single system. The application of this new organization started during the academic year 2006/07. 

Enrollment rates at the secondary level have been rising since the year 2000, except for the period 2005/06, when the system changed from 4-4–4 years at each education level to 5-4–3 years, thus distorting the figures. The gender parity index of the secondary level gross enrollment rate in 2007 was 0.98, reflecting parity in gender at the secondary level. Now the focus of the Ministry of Education will be on improving the quality of the education system. Girls outperform boys in every subject of the 12th grade examinations, particularly in philosophy, English, Arabic languages, chemistry, physics, mathematics and biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Kuwait Education Indicators Report 2007,pp88}}&lt;/ref&gt; International indicators such as the [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study]] and [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]] are not very encouraging. Special attention is being given to reducing repetition and dropout rates.

The Ministry of Education in [[Kuwait]] is also trying to foster the use of information technology ([[Information and communication technologies|ICT]]) in schools by including e-learning in the curriculum. For fourteen-year-olds in 2006, there were 13 students per computer on average in Kuwait's public schools. This is very similar to the [[OECD]] average, back in 2000, for 15-year-olds. Despite the availability of computers in schools and at home, there is no guarantee that computers will be used solely for learning, however, and the government may need to rethink the strategy of making technology accessible to a large number of students, whilst developing a curriculum that incorporates e-learning in most of the subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Kuwait Education Indicators Report 2007,pp85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Education in Kuwait is making efforts to provide equal educational opportunities by opening special needs institutes. In total there are 44 special needs schools out of which 33 are public schools and 11 are private schools. Some of the special needs children are also enrolled in special needs classes offered in general schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Kuwait Education Indicators Report 2007,pp110-111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vocational, post-secondary and tertiary education===
Post-secondary education comprises technical and vocational courses offered by [[the Public Authority for Applied Education and Training]] (PAAET), a state institution, and degree programs offered by [[Kuwait University]], and 14 private universities .

The Government of Kuwait is encouraging its citizens to opt for vocational training programs to fulfill the demand for a skilled workforce. Students enrolling for vocational training at [[PAAET]] can join programs after primary, intermediate or secondary school, although the majority of students, about 70 percent, are enrolled having completed secondary level education. In 2005/06 there were 12,285 students enrolled in after-secondary training courses, of which 62 percent were female. The total number of students in vocational training at [[PAAET]] increased by 8 percent from the previous year, to 17,459 students. The male enrollment decreased by 10 percent whereas the female enrollment increased by 42 percent. This substantial increase was due to the introduction of new vocational programs in line with the demands of the female students .

Post-secondary education include courses at a [[PAAET]] technical college lasting for two and a half years, following which the students receive a certificate that is less than a tertiary diploma, but does allow the graduates to enter the workforce.

====Higher education====

There are four state-supported higher education institutions in Kuwait.
*[[Kuwait University]]
*The College of Basic Education in [[PAAET]]
*Higher Institute for Theater Arts
*Higher Institute of Music Arts

In the academic year 2005/06, the total enrollment within these institutions reached 27,308, an increase of 7 percent from the previous year. The proportion of females in the undergraduate studies is 70 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Kuwait Education Indicators Report 2007,pp122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gross enrollment ratio in tertiary education in both private and public institutions in 2006 was about 18 percent; the male gross enrollment ratio was 11 percent, a slight increase from the previous year, and for females it was 26 percent, a three percentage points decrease from the previous year.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Institute of Statistics"/&gt;

=====Kuwait University=====
[[Kuwait University]] was established in 1966. It is a co-educational institution and comprises five campuses in [[Kuwait City]]. Since its inception, the number of students has increased considerably, from 400 at its inception to 19,711 in 2005/06. It offers a wide range of academic courses.

=====Public Authority for Applied Education and Training=====
[[The Public Authority for Applied Education and Training]] was established in 1982 to fill the need for a vocational and technical training institution. [[PAAET]] has two missions: [[PAAET]] is responsible for providing and developing the skills of the national labor force to meet the demands of a developing nation, and it provides training to students to have careers beyond the oil industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kuwaitculture.com/About%20Us/higher.htm|title= Embassy of the Kuwait, Cultural Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; The College of Basic Education in [[PAAET]], with an enrollment of 7,132, enjoyed an increase of 26 percent from the previous year.

=====Other institutions=====
There are also a number of private post-secondary institutions in Kuwait that are accredited by the Ministry of Higher Education - Private Universities Council:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= http://www.puc.edu.kw/?com=category&amp;act=view&amp;id=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7960">'''Elam Ives, Jr.''' (1802&amp;ndash;1864) was a [[New England]]-based music teacher whose work with [[William Channing Woodbridge]] helped introduce the ideas of [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] into music education in the United States. His work also influenced [[Lowell Mason]], whose work with Woodbridge eventually led to music education being introduced into the public schools of Boston.

==Early life and career==
Little is known of Ives' early life. He was born to Elam Ives, Sr., and Sarah Hitchcock Ives in [[Hamden, Connecticut]], on 7 January 1802. He married Louisa Todd of Hamden on 15 April 1822, at which time he was already working as a singing teacher and choir director. He later moved to New Haven and then to Hartford sometime before 19 October 1827, when he was hired by the Christ Church there to teach music.&lt;ref&gt;Gilsig, M.A. (1985). ''Elam Ives, Jr., 1802-1864 musician-educator'' (Doctoral dissertation). Retrieved from ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses (ML31197), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ives worked with a friend and fellow musician, Deodatus Dutton, on a collection of hymn tunes called ''American Psalmody''&lt;ref&gt;Ives, E., &amp; Dutton, D. (1829). ''American psalmody: A collection of sacred music; Comprising a great variety of psalm and hymn tunes, set pieces, anthems and chants. Arranged with a figured base for the organ or piano forte. To which is prefixed elements of musical elocution; being a new and methodical arrangement of the principles of vocal music by which the theory and practice of the art are made easily intelligible. Designed for the use of schools and private pupils.'' Hartford, CT: H. &amp; F.J. Huntington.&lt;/ref&gt; which also contained singing instructions by Ives.

==Work with William Channing Woodbridge==
In 1829, a fellow citizen of Hartford, [[William Channing Woodbridge]], returned from Europe, where he had been studying methods of education, and where he had spent time with [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]], [[Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg]], Michael Traugott Pfeiffer, and [[Hans Georg Nägeli]].&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, E. R. (1984). William Channing Woodbridge's lecture “On vocal music as a branch of common education” revisited. ''Studies in music'', 18, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to the United States, he wanted to use the methods he had seen in Europe to improve music teaching. He was friends with Dutton, who placed him in contact with Ives.&lt;ref&gt;Gilsig, 1985, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Woodbridge provided Ives with books and materials by Nägeli, Pfeiffer, and [[Georg Friedrich Kübler]], who then translated them with the help of Dutton and a Mr. Taylor from Andover.&lt;ref name="Gilsig"&gt;Gilsig (1985), 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodbridge by this time had become associated with [[Lowell Mason]], a music teacher in Boston. He sent Mason to Hartford to work with Ives on the method.{{clarify|date=December 2014}} According to Ives, both had concerns about the method, but chose to proceed.&lt;ref name="Gilsig" /&gt;  After studying the Swiss works, and incorporating them into his teaching method, Ives put together an experimental choir of about 70 children during the summer of 1830. The choir evidently sang very well and word of its success was spread by Woodbridge to Boston and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Woodbridge, W. C. (1830). On vocal music as a branch of common education, ''American Annals of Education'', 1(2), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work with Lowell Mason==
During this same summer, Ives was working on a revision of the instruction portion of ''American Psalmody'' that would reflect the Pestalozzian-based ideas promoted by Woodbridge.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, E., &amp; Dutton, D. (1830). ''American psalmody: … 2nd. ed., greatly enlarged with alterations and improvements'' (2nd ed.). Hartford, CT: H. &amp; F.J. Huntington.&lt;/ref&gt; He also began work on ''The American Elementary Singing Book''&lt;ref&gt;Ives, E. (1832). ''The American elementary [or infant school] singing book. Designed as the first book for the study of music''. Hartford, CT: F.J. Huntington.&lt;/ref&gt; that same year.&lt;ref&gt;John, R. W. (1960) Elam Ives and the Pestalozzian philosophy of music education. ''Journal of research in music education'', 8(1), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he began working with Mason on ''Juvenile Lyre'',&lt;ref&gt;Mason, L., &amp; Ives, E. (1831). ''Juvenile lyre: Hymns and songs, religious, moral, and cheerful, set to appropriate music. For the use of primary and common schools''. Boston: Richardson, Lord and Holbrook; Hartford: N. &amp; F.J. Huntington.&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of three-part children's songs, published in 1831. This collection consisted primarily of arrangements of songs by Nägeli and Pfeiffer, with some original compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, H. E. (1957). ''The influence of Pestalozzianism on instruction in music''. (Doctoral dissertation). Retrieved from ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses (5801396), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some debate over who wrote what in ''Juvenile Lyre''; it appears that the Preface and final song, "Suffer Little Children to Come unto Me", are definitely by Mason, while many of the arrangements were done by Ives with versification of the German texts by Dutton.&lt;ref&gt;John, 1960, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Other songs were originals by one of the composers, several with texts by [[Sarah Josepha Hale]].

==Philadelphia and New York==
Ives left Hartford for Philadelphia late in 1830, where he established the Philadelphia Musical Seminary.&lt;ref&gt;Gilsig, 1985, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; There, he taught violin, pianoforte, and singing. He also continued writing singing manuals and collections music, including materials for the [[American Sunday School Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Ives, E. (1831). ''A manual of instruction in the art of singing''. Philadelphia: American Sunday School Union; and Ives, E. (1832). ''American Sunday-school psalmody, or, Hymns and music: For the use of Sunday-schools and teachers’ meetings: With a manual of instruction''. Philadelphia: American Sunday School Union.&lt;/ref&gt; He also made a major revision of ''American Psalmody'', removing most of the Pestalozzian elements introduced in the second edition.&lt;ref&gt;Gilsig, 1985, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ives moved from Philadelphia to New York in 1836, where he started another musical academy.&lt;ref&gt;Gilsig, 1985, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued publishing music collections with appended instruction manuals and an entire series intended specifically to help students learn to read music and sing.&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement for ''The Musical ABC, The Musical Spelling Book, The Musical Reader, The Beethoven Collection of Church Music, and The Mozart Collection of Sacred Music''. (1851). In E. Gurnsey, ''History of the United States of America''. New York: Cady &amp; Burgess, p. 471-473.&lt;/ref&gt; While in New York, Ives spent some time writing essays and periodical articles. He edited ''[[The Musical Review]]'' during its one year run in 1838-39. He also wrote four articles for ''[[The Harbinger (journal)|The Harbinger]]'', a transcendentalist journal, beginning in 1847. Most of this writing concerned musical events, music educators, and music education materials.&lt;ref&gt;Gilsig, 1985, 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

In both Philadelphia and New York, Ives wrote parlor songs, though he was not a remarkable composer. Their difficulty and complexity do seem to indicate the quality of singers and pianists he was producing in his academies, though.&lt;ref&gt;Gilsig, 1985, 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late career and death==
Ives moved to Trenton, New Jersey, sometime before 1857. He lived there with his second wife, Lucy, and daughter, Ella.&lt;ref name="Gilsig_a"&gt;Gilsig, 1985, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; As in Philadelphia and New York, Ives established an academy of music. 

At some point, Ives returned to his hometown of Hamden, Connecticut. He died there of [[apoplexy]] on 10 February 1864.&lt;ref name="Gilsig_a" /&gt;

'''Elizabeth Gerber''' is an Associate Professor in the [[Segal Design Institute]], [[Mechanical Engineering]], and [[Technology and Social Behavior]] departments at [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/|title=Faculty Directory: Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering|publisher=[[Northwestern University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsb.northwestern.edu/people.php|title=People –  Technology and Social Behavior|publisher=[[Northwestern University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Gerber earned her B.A. at [[Dartmouth College]] in Studio Art and Engineering in 1998, and her M.S. at [[Stanford University]] in the Joint Program in Product Design in 2003. She earned her Ph.D. in Management Science &amp; Engineering at Stanford University  in 2007 working with [[Robert I. Sutton]], [[Chip Heath]], and [[Pamela Hinds]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://egerber.mech.northwestern.edu/?page_id=53 Elizabeth Gerber's Curriculum Vitae]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gerber has been on the faculty at Northwestern University since 2008. Her primary appointments are in the Segal Design Institute (School of Engineering), Mechanical Engineering (School of Engineering), and Technology and Social Behavior Department (School of Communication). She holds additional appointments by courtesy in Industrial Engineering &amp; Management Science (School of Engineering), Management &amp; Organizations (School of Management), Learning Sciences (School of Education &amp; Social Policy), and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (School of Engineering).

Gerber is the founder of Design for America, which is an organization of people dedicated to using design innovation for social good.&lt;ref&gt;[http://designforamerica.com Design for America]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her research in design focuses on collective innovation and design education. Collective innovation is the process and study (potentially) large groups of people who may not be familiar with design practice to work together to solve problems. Design education is thus related in that it considers how to teach students design. Gerber orients her research toward solving problems with positive social outcomes.

==Awards and honors==

Gerber has received a number of awards and honors for her research, teaching, and outreach, such as the [[IEEE Computer Science and Engineering Undergraduate Teaching Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Northwestern Professor Liz Gerber Named 2014 Recipient of Computer Science and Engineering Undergraduate Teaching Award|url=https://www.computer.org/web/pressroom/northwestern-professor-liz-gerber-named-2014-recipient-of-undergraduate-teaching-award|accessdate=19 January 2017|agency=IEEE Computer Society|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was named among Crain's Chicago Business 40 under 40.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagobusiness.com/section/40under40-2013 Crain's Chicago Business 40 Under 40 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; She has received multiple teaching awards at Northwestern University, including the University Teaching Award in 2016 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northwestern.edu/provost/faculty-honors/university-teaching-awards/award-recipients/index.html University Teaching Awards: Office of the Provost - Northwestern University]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Elizabeth Hurlock Beckman Award in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wellsfargo.com/private-foundations/beckman-award-trust/ Elizabeth Hurlock Beckman Award Trust  – Foundation Grants – Wells Fargo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of this and similar institutions was to provide Polish youth with an opportunity for an education within the framework of traditional Polish scholarship, when that collided with the ideology of the governing authorities. In the 19th century, such underground institutions were important in the national effort to resist [[Germanization]] under Prussian and [[Russification]] under Russian [[partitions of Poland|occupation]].&lt;ref name="UHE"&gt;[[David Palfreyman]] (ed.), [[Ted Tapperm]], ''Understanding Mass Higher Education'', Routledge (UK), 2004, {{ISBN|0-415-35491-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415354919&amp;id=riv0UCM90AMC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=%22Flying+University%22+Russification&amp;sig=MVJ6bK6melK1V8sj4ofeJTSULto Google Print, pp. 141–142].&lt;/ref&gt;  In the communist [[People's Republic of Poland]], the Flying University provided educational opportunities outside [[Censorship in the People's Republic of Poland|government censorship]] and control of education.&lt;ref name="Dilemmas"&gt;[[Barbara J Falk]], ''The Dilemmas of Dissidence in East-Central Europe: Citizen Intellectuals and Philosopher Kings'', Central European University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|963-9241-39-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9639241393&amp;id=ZsR0CGdWCC0C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=%22Flying+University%22&amp;sig=zu4Z2HAP8GfIWsG2aRUz0tCuyPo Google Print, p. 42].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Partitions ===
After the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was [[partitions of Poland|partitioned]] in the late-18th century, its lands were divided among its neighbors: [[Imperial Russia]], [[Prussia]] and [[Austro-Hungary]]. [[Warsaw]], the historic Polish capital, fell under Russian control.  In the Russian and Prussian partitions the situation of Poles progressively worsened.&lt;ref name="UHE"/&gt; Particularly in the Russian sector, the initially moderate ethnic policies were revised in the aftermath of the Polish revolts aimed at overthrowing Russian control, the [[November Uprising]] (1830–1831) and the [[January Uprising]] (1863–1864).  Following the defeats of the uprising the autonomy of the [[Congress Poland]] was initially limited (1831) and finally abolished (1865).

Among the increasing policies of [[Germanization]] and [[Russification]], it became increasingly difficult for Poles to obtain a Polish [[higher education]].&lt;ref name="UHE"/&gt;  Also, like in most parts of Europe at the time, the higher education opportunities for women that existed in the Russian Empire were severely limited,&lt;ref name="Women"&gt;[[Christine Johanson]], ''Women's Struggle for Higher Education in Russia, 1855–1900'', McGill-Queen's Press, 1987, {{ISBN|0-7735-0565-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0773505652&amp;id=B_BfKgWKDy8C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=Polish+women+education+Russian&amp;sig=abGkPXvchVcMsiA3WI5s4nm15vY Google Print, p. 23]&lt;/ref&gt; and teaching or research into some fields, like [[Polish language]], [[Catholicism]] or [[Polish history]], ranged from difficult to illegal.&lt;ref name="UHE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RR1905"&gt;[[Abraham Ascher]], ''The Revolution of 1905: A Short History'', Stanford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-8047-5028-9}} [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0804750289&amp;id=rNRqfGWR4pIC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=Russification+education+Poland&amp;sig=2Ua-OiKEPlnUKEOlh-2wV-s4gqo Google Print, p. 47].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NaH"&gt;[[Peter Brock (historian)|Peter Brock]], John Stanley, Piotr J.

As a response to such policies,&lt;ref name="UHE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TEOIR"&gt;[[Peter Waldron]], ''The End of Imperial Russia, 1855–1917'', Palgrave, 1997, {{ISBN|0-312-16537-4}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0312165374&amp;id=gvLExy_Z3PsC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=%22Flying+University%22+Russia&amp;sig=bsfJl76F6_L2kXVC9TQCQcAm43Q Google Print, p. 120].&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired by the [[Polish positivism]] movement,&lt;ref name="WNBTH"&gt;[[Brian Porter (historian)|Brian Porter]], ''When Nationalism Began to Hate: Imagining Modern Politics in Nineteenth-Century Poland'', Oxford University Press US, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-515187-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0195151879&amp;id=qSWJ5WGSmJgC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=%22Flying+University%22+Russia&amp;sig=b6iawQ_KLGuN0A8Evie2v7KOXbk Google Print, p. 85].&lt;/ref&gt; secret courses began in 1882 in private houses in Warsaw. At first it was a series of conspiratorial education courses for women, and among the first teachers were [[Józef Siemaszko]], [[Stanisław Norblin]], [[Piotr Chmielowski]] and [[Władysław Smoleński]]. In 1885 transformed due to the efforts of one of the students, [[Jadwiga Szczawińska]]&lt;ref name="Korczak"&gt;[[Betty Jean Lifton]], ''The King of Children: The Life and Death of Janusz Korczak'', St. Martin's Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-312-15560-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0312155603&amp;id=cuK1wyWayOoC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=%22Flying+University%22&amp;sig=2g91WxdFeB6AxkWU-cBBOG7ZeS8 Google Print, pp. 35–40].&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as Zofia Szczawińska&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;[[Margarita Diaz-Andreu]], ''Excavating Women: A History of Women in European Archaeology'', Routledge (UK), 1998, {{ISBN|0-415-15760-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415157609&amp;id=RcsI5IvpocMC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=%22Flying+University%22&amp;sig=ya4wbGwpLlcWNg3GloCLVxW1z2M Google Print, p. 88].&lt;/ref&gt;), the various pro-education groups were united into a single, informal, and illegal, secret university open for both sexes&lt;ref name="Korczak"/&gt; known as the Flying University (the courses, spread throughout the city, often changed locations to prevent the Russian authorities from learning the location and arresting the teachers and students&lt;ref name="Korczak"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt;). The fees (2–4 [[Russian ruble|rubles]] per month) were used as gratification for the teachers, and to create a secret library.  The [[curriculum]] of the Flying University covered 5–6 years with 8–11 hours per week and was divided into four main subjects: [[social sciences]], [[pedagogy]], [[philology]] and [[history]], and [[natural sciences]].

Among the teachers of the university were the best contemporary Polish academics,&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt; such as Władysław Smoleński and [[Tadeusz Korzon]] (history), [[Bronisław Chlebowski]], [[Ignacy Chrzanowski]], [[Zofia Daszyńska-Golińska]]&lt;ref name=haan&gt;{{cite book|last=Haan|first=edited by Francisca de|title=Biographical dictionary of women's movements and feminisms in Central, Eastern, and South Eastern Europe : 19th and 20th centuries|date=2005|publisher=Central European University Press|location=New York|isbn=9637326391|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=9637326391|edition=1st|author2=Daskalova, Krassimira|author3=Loutfi, Anna}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Piotr Chmielowski (literature), [[Jan Władysław David]] and [[Adam Mahrburg]] (philosophy), [[Ludwik Krzywicki]] (sociology), [[Józef Nussbaum-Hilarowicz]] (biology).&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;[[Norman Davies]], ''[[God's Playground]]: A History of Poland'', Columbia University Press, 1982, {{ISBN|0-231-05352-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0231053525&amp;id=DMoPXktGwiUC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=%22Flying+University%22&amp;sig=mALqwAUSy_O2qqrHk66FWLkiYKM Google Print, p. 235].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the twenty years of the existence of the university, its courses were attended by approximately 5,000 women and thousands of men. Among the most famous of its students was the future [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[Maria Skłodowska-Curie]], more commonly known as Madame Curie.&lt;ref name="UHE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt; Other well known students included [[Zofia Nałkowska]] and [[Janusz Korczak]].&lt;ref name="Korczak"/&gt;

===Legalization===
Around 1905–1906 the Flying University was able to start legal activities, and was transformed into the Society of Science Courses (''Towarzystwo Kursów Naukowych''),&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt; as Poland's partitioners, anticipating the [[First World War|coming war]], sought to convert the Poles to their cause.&lt;ref name="UHE"/&gt; Around 1918–1919, after Poland regained independence (as the [[Second Polish Republic]]), the Association was transformed into the private [[university]], [[Free Polish University]] (Wolna Wszechnica Polska).&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt; In 1927 it founded a branch in [[Łódź]].

===World War II===
{{Main|Education in Poland during World War II}}
During the [[Second World War]], when Poland was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] which forbade Poles to attend university-level courses, many teachers of the Flying University used their experience and took part in [[education in Poland during World War II|secret teaching during World War II]].

===People's Republic===
After the Second World War, the Wolna Wszechnica Polska was not immediately recreated in Warsaw, although its branch in Łódź served as the foundation for the [[University of Łódź]].

During the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|time of communist domination]] in the [[People's Republic of Poland]], as [[Education in the People's Republic of Poland|the curriculum became a tool of politics]], and much of [[Polish history]] (like the [[Polish-Soviet War]], [[Katyn Massacre]] or [[Praga Massacre]]) was [[censored]] in an attempt to 'erase' the history of Polish-Russian conflicts,&lt;ref name="Ferro"&gt;[[Marc Ferro]], ''The Use and Abuse of History: Or How the Past Is Taught to Children'', Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|0-415-28592-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415285925&amp;id=hDkeOWop9TsC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;lpg=PA259&amp;dq=Suvorov+ordered+Praga&amp;sig=dhghhzzFYdX1oAGaMx8ZoTQDsMI Google Print, p. 259].&lt;/ref&gt; the tradition of the Flying University was revived once again, first by the Society of Free Polish University (Towarzystwo Wolnej Wszechnicy Polskiej) active in Warsaw from 1957, later from 1977 by the new Flying University and Society of Science Courses, supported by Polish [[dissident]]s: [[Stefan Amsterdamski]], [[Andrzej Celiński]], [[Bohdan Cywiński]], [[Aldona Jawłowska]], [[Jan Kielanowski]], [[Andrzej Kijowski]], [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]], [[Wojciech Ostrowski]].

Many participants of this second flying university were abused by [[Milicja Obywatelska|milicja]], with common incidents like a prominent dissident, [[Jacek Kuroń]], being thrown down the stairs or his apartment ransacked by milicja-supported thugs; despite such harassment the Flying University was active until the imposition of [[martial law in Poland]] in 1981, which, although designed to destroy the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement, stifled the flying university's activities too.  With Solidarity's peaceful victory in the [[Polish legislative elections, 1989]], the goals of the Flying University — the freeing of Polish education from party's control and censorship — have been achieved.

The '''Illinois College of Photography and Bissell College of Photo Engraving''' was a college in [[Effingham, Illinois]] opened in 1893 and closed in 1931,&lt;ref name="dailynews"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Donaldson |first1=Delaine |title=Effingham's Illinois College of Photography |url=http://www.effinghamdailynews.com/news/lifestyles/effingham-s-illinois-college-of-photography/article_d4f0b739-2e3d-5322-a188-9846284466fe.html |website=Effingham Daily News |accessdate=1 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a focus on practical, vocational photographic training.&lt;ref name="catalog"&gt;{{cite book |title=Illinois College of Photography :Effingham, Illinois 1905-1906. |date=1905-1906 |page=7 |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uiuo.ark:/13960/t25b01d3k |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college was founded by photographer Lewis H. Bissell,&lt;ref name="dailynews2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lewis |first1=Phil |title=Vintage views from the Illinois College of Photography |url=http://www.effinghamdailynews.com/news/local_news/vintage-views-from-the-illinois-college-of-photography/article_0c7fd9e0-31c1-586c-a042-c016575fdae5.html |website=Effingham Daily News |accessdate=1 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was located initially on the Austin College campus in [[Effingham County, Illinois|Effingham County]], Illinois. It later moved to its separate studio and buildings in 1900 at 910–945 Wabash Ave in Effingham. At one time the school had several hundred students from the U.S., Canada and 52 countries.

The college closed in 1931, due to poor enrollment during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="dailynews" /&gt;

Graduates were expected to "go out fully equipped and the fact that they are alumni of the Illinois College of Photography is a guarantee that they are artists in their lines.  A diploma from this institution assures them the most remunerative positions in the best studios in the country."

Garner played the girlfriend of [[Ashton Kutcher]]'s character in the comedy ''[[Dude, Where's My Car?]]'' (2000). In 2001, she appeared briefly opposite her husband Foley in the drama ''[[Stealing Time]]'' and had a small role as a nurse in the war epic ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff |first=Movieline |url=http://movieline.com/2001/04/01/jennifer-garner/ |title=Jennifer Garner |publisher=Movieline |date=April 1, 2001 |accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garner rose to fame in 2001 when she was cast as the star of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] spy drama ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]''.&lt;ref name="rollingstone1"/&gt; The show's creator, J.J.

===2002–2011: Transition to film===
While ''Alias'' was airing, Garner continued to work in film intermittently. She had an "other-worldly" experience when [[Steven Spielberg]] called to offer her a role as a high-class call girl in ''[[Catch Me if You Can]]'' (2002).&lt;ref name="cbr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/electrifying-lady-garner-discusses-playing-elektra-in-daredevil/ |title=Electrifying lady: Garner discusses playing Elektra in 'Daredevil' |publisher=CBR |date= |accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing her in ''Alias'', Speilberg felt sure "she would be the next superstar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catch Me If You Can: Production Notes|url=http://culture.com/articles/1758/catch-me-if-you-can-production-notes.phtml|publisher=Culture.com|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She filmed her scene opposite [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] during a one-day shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Head |first=Steve |url=http://ie.ign.com/articles/2002/12/20/an-interview-with-leonardo-dicaprio |title=An Interview with Leonardo DiCaprio – IGN |publisher=Ie.ign.com |date=December 20, 2002 |accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garner's first co-starring film role was in the action movie ''Daredevil'' (2003), in which she played [[Elektra Natchios|Elektra]] to [[Ben Affleck]]'s ''Daredevil''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Todd |last=McCarthy |url=https://variety.com/2003/film/reviews/daredevil-1200543427/ |title=Daredevil |publisher=Variety |date=February 13, 2003 |accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physicality required for the role was something Garner had discovered "an aptitude for" while working on ''Alias.''&lt;ref name="cbr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/ben-affleck-man-without-fear-part-2/ |title=Ben Affleck, Man Without Fear, Part 2 |publisher=CBR |date=February 14, 2003 |accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elvis Mitchell of ''The New York Times'' said she "realizes Elektra more through movement than by way of her lumpy, obvious lines.

Garner's first leading film role, in the romantic comedy ''[[13 Going on 30]]'' (2004), was widely praised. She played a teenager who finds herself trapped in the body of a 30-year-old.

After a one-year break following the conclusion of ''Alias'', her wedding to Affleck, and the birth of her first child, Garner returned to work in 2007. Her supporting role in ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'' as a woman desperate to adopt a child was described by Kyle Buchanan of ''New York Magazine'' as a turning point in her career: "She came into the movie a steely figure, and left it as the mother you'd give your own child to ...

Garner co-starred in two romantic comedies in 2009.

Garner's second performance of 2009 was opposite comedian [[Ricky Gervais]] in his directorial debut ''[[The Invention of Lying]]''.

'''Kabul University''' ('''KU''') ([[Pashto language|Pashto]] دکابل پوهنتون ''Da Kābul Pohantūn '' / [[Persian language|Dari]] پوهنتون کابل ''Pohantūn-e Kābul'') is located in [[Kabul]], the capital of [[Afghanistan]]. It was founded in 1931 during the government of [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]] and then [[Prime Minister]] [[Mohammad Hashim Khan]]

Kabul University is attended by approximately 25,000 students, of which around 40% are women. The main building was renovated about 500 metres from the old one, which has almost the same design.

The mission of Kabul University is to mature and prosper as an internationally recognised institution of learning and research, a community of stakeholders committed to shared governance, and a centre of innovative thought and practice.

==History==
[[File:1950s Afghanistan - Biology class, Kabul University.jpg|thumb|Biology class during the late 1950s or early 1960s.]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kabul uni students.png|thumb|right|Students outside the campus, c. 1990{{deletable image-caption|Saturday, 28 April 2018|F7}}]] --&gt;
Kabul University was established in 1931 during the reign of Mohammed Nadir Shah and then Prime Minister Mohammad Hashim Khan, opening its doors one year later to students from across the country. It benefitted from partnerships with the governments of [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Russia]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1694972.stm | work=BBC News | title=Tunes of hope at Kabul University | date=6 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s foreign-educated scholars populated the campus, exposing the new generation to new topics such as [[communism]], [[feminism]] and [[capitalism]]. Students influenced during this era included [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]], [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], Dr. [[Faiz Ahmad]], and [[Saydal Sokhandan]].

Many different political groups were influenced in the university such as [[Khalq]]ists, [[Parcham]]ites, [[Shola-y-Jaweid|Sholayees]], and [[Ikhwan]]ists.

In a clash between Ikhwanis and Sholayees, a poet named Saydal Sokhandan was killed by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in the 1970s. Saydal was fired upon and shot by Gulbuddin during an argument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maoism.ru/alo/glossary.htm www.maoism.ru - Glossary of Names and Terms mentioned in the Historical Overview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716183357/http://www.maoism.ru/alo/glossary.htm |date=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the governance of the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA)]], Kabul University lost several lecturers and staff.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The majority of the university's faculty left during the ten-year period of unrest or civil war that followed after the fall of the PDPA government in 1992. The area around the university and [[Karte Char]] was a major battleground in the [[Afghan Civil War (1992-96)]].

===Rebuilding===
[[File:Zalmay Khalilzad and Ashraf Ghani at Kabul University in 2005.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zalmay Khalilzad]] &amp; [[Ashraf Ghani]] in University Library 2005]] 
After the removal of the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban government]] in late 2001, the international community focused on rebuilding the educational institutions in Afghanistan. By January 2004 the campus had only 24 computers. As part of its recovery program the university has established partnerships with four foreign universities, including [[Purdue University]] and the [[University of Arizona]]. Furthermore, the Information Technology Center was founded in 2002 with the cooperation of [[German Academic Exchange Service]] (DAAD) and [[Technical University of Berlin]]. The number of students in higher education had increased across the country from 22,717 in 2002 to 56,451 in 2008. By 2008, the university was attended by 9,660 students, 2,336 (24%) of them being women.

It was reported in 2007 that Iran donated funds to the university's [[dentistry]] faculty and donated 25,000 books. The main library of Kabul University was built by the United States, which is the best-equipped library in Afghanistan. It is equipped with computers, books and magazines. [[Nancy Dupree]], wife of [[Louis Dupree (professor)|Louis Dupree]], was the Director of the Afghanistan Center at the university.

In 2008, the campus of Kabul University was provided with local network facilities by the [[Information Technology]] center of Kabul University (ITCK).&lt;ref name="ITCK"&gt;[http://www.itck.af] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817053542/http://itck.af/ |date=17 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each building is connected to the campus network and is provided with the internet connection from a fiber optic backbone. The [[Voice over IP]] (VoIP) technology was also part of the networking project, which improved the quality telephone communication at the university level.

'''LanSchool''' is [[classroom management]] software owned by [[Lenovo]]. It is used by schools to monitor students' activity in a digital classroom. It includes a screen monitor, keystroke monitor, teacher-to-student chat feature, URL monitor, Camera monitor, microphone access, and various other features. Both the LanSchool keystroke monitor and URL monitor can store data for later collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lanschool.com/lanschool/features/monitor-students | title = Monitor Students | accessdate = 2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
LanSchool products use a proprietary remote desktop protocol that communicates via [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]].  A console application is installed on the Teacher’s computer which communicates peer-to-peer with a software agent running on the student computers. The software is available in a 'Teacher' and 'Student' edition. The Teacher edition allows the user to access and control the computers with the Student edition installed on them. Lanschool can be downloaded on multiple software such as Windows and Mac.&lt;ref&gt;https://helpdesk.stone-ware.com/portal/kb/articles/installing-lanschool-7-8-on-a-mac&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Originally named LanFan Technologies, the company was founded in February 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanschool.com/press|title=Press Releases - LanSchool|work=LanSchool Press|date=2011-02-09|accessdate=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Dana Doggett began exploring the concept of a software application that would allow an instructor to leverage a local area network to teach using technology. {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Dana developed a software tool called PC Chalkboard that was immediately implemented by Novell. PC Chalkboard allowed Novell lab instructors to broadcast their screens to each PC in the lab.  LanSchool was licensed by both Intel and IBM and actively marketed through each company’s education sales channel. The IBM relationship is still active today. In April 2001, Dana left Intel and formed a new company, LanSchool Technologies, LLC where he could work on LanSchool full-time.  The new company’s mission is to improve education worldwide through the use of innovative technological solutions.

'''Lawrence S. Wittner''' (born May 5, 1941 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American historian who has written extensively on peace movements, foreign policy, and economic inequality.

He attended Columbia College (B.A., 1962), the [[University of Wisconsin]] (M.A. in history, 1963), and [[Columbia University]] (Ph.D. in history, 1967).  Subsequently, he taught at Hampton Institute, at [[Vassar College]], and—under the Fulbright program—at Japanese universities.  In 1974, he began teaching at the State University of New York/Albany, where he rose to the rank of Professor of History before his retirement in 2010.

Wittner is the author of nine books, the editor or co-editor of another four, and the author of approximately 400 published articles and book reviews.  From 1984 to 1987, he edited ''Peace &amp; Change,'' a journal of peace research.  His article "Peace Movements and Foreign Policy" won the Charles DeBenedetti award of the Conference on Peace Research in History in 1989, and his ''One World or None:  A History of the World Nuclear Disarmament Movement Through 1953'' received the Warren Kuehl Book Prize of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations in 1995.  He received the New York State/United University Professions Excellence Award for scholarship, teaching, and service in 1990 and the Peace History Society's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011.

A former president of the Council on Peace Research in History (now the Peace History Society), an affiliate of the American Historical Association, Wittner also chaired the Peace History Commission of the International Peace Research Association.

He has received major fellowships or grants from the American Council of Learned Societies, the Aspen Institute, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the United States Institute of Peace.

Wittner has spoken at the United Nations and at the Norwegian Nobel Institute, delivered guest lectures on dozens of college and university campuses (including Princeton University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Yale University, Harvard University, Rutgers University, the University of Colorado, the University of Wisconsin, American University, the University of Maine, the University of Connecticut, the University of Utah, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of New Mexico, Swarthmore College, the College of William and Mary, Colgate University, and the University of Alaska Southeast), and given talks in numerous countries (including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Japan, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Spain, and Switzerland).

Blending intellectual life with political activity, Wittner has been active since 1961 in the racial equality, labor, and peace movements.  He was an early civil rights and anti-apartheid activist and served for decades as an elected leader of United University Professions (the SUNY faculty-staff union that is affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers).  In 2016, he was elected by Democratic Party voters of New York's 20th Congressional district to serve as a Bernie Sanders delegate to the Democratic national convention.  Currently, he is the co-chair of the national board of Peace Action (the largest peace organization in the United States) and a member of the executive committee of the Albany County Central Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO.  On occasion, he performs vocally and on the banjo with the Solidarity Singers, who enliven a variety of events—in prisons, on picket lines, and at meetings of the American Historical Association—with their music.

'''LeanShare LLC''' is a software company located inside Arrowhead Business Park in [[Maumee, OH]]. The company sells human resources software to businesses. LearnShare was formed from a [[consortium]] in 1996.

== History ==
LearnShare LLC was founded in September 1996 as a [[consortium]] of Fortune 500 companies.  The original companies were :
* [[3M]]
* [[John Deere &amp; Company]]
* Aeroquip Vickers (later acquired by [[Eaton Corporation]])
* [[General Motors]]
* Libby Owens Ford (later acquired by [[Pilkington]])
* [[Owens Corning]]
* [[Motorola]] Inc
* O-I (known at that time as [[Owens-Illinois]])
* [[Reynolds Metals]]
&lt;ref name="USDLA Journal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fortune 500 Companies Go Online To  Create World's Largest Learning Center |publisher=USDLA Journal |url=http://www.usdla.org/html/journal/SEP01_Issue/techex04.html |date=2010-05-22 |accessdate=2010-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930222011/http://www.usdla.org/html/journal/SEP01_Issue/techex04.html |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1995-2000: Consortium Creation ===
In October 1995 Rick Corry of [[Owens Corning]] invited 18 non-competing companies to discuss the formation of a collaborative training consortium. A nucleus of these companies (those listed above) established a limited liability corporation.&lt;ref name="ERIC"&gt;{{cite web |author=Rick Corry |title=The LearnShare Consortium: A Model for the Future. |publisher=[[Education Resources Information Center]] |url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED427694 |date=2010-05-05 |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1996, four more companies joined the consortium:
* [[Chevron Corporation]]
* [[Levi Strauss &amp; Company]]
* Warner Lambert (acquired by [[Pfizer]])
* [[Northwest Airlines]]

Each company contributed $100,000 a year for 2 years and received a seat on the board of directors. The Board also had three non-voting members from academia:
* [[Farleigh Dickinson University]]
* [[Arizona State University]]
* [[Ohio State University]]

LearnShare, LLC started as a service organization that developed multi-media and distance learning technologies.  The concept was for member companies to share existing materials and expertise.  The consortium would then develop technology-based training at the lowest possible cost for member companies.

LearnShare members share their best practices with each other.  By doing so, participating companies improve training while reducing costs.&lt;ref name="Share"&gt;{{cite web |title=Training &amp; development managers share best practices and courseware through LearnShare |publisher=Toledo Business Journal |author=Susan Reynolds |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5333/is_200508/ai_n21386208/ |date=2010-05-22 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through 2000, LearnShare was funded by its founding members.  Starting in 2001, the consortium hired Lois Webster from Motorola as the CEO/General Manager of LearnShare to move the company to a for-profit company.

=== 2000-2007: Sustaining Members===
In 2001 LearnShare accepted "sustaining members" in 2-year agreements. Since that time, 40 additional corporations joined the consortium which now represents more than 2.5 million employees around the globe.&lt;ref name="LearnShare"&gt;{{cite web|title=About LearnShare |publisher=LeanShare |url=http://www.learnshare.com/v2/about_learnshare.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130127212637/http://www.learnshare.com/v2/about_learnshare.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-27 |date=2010-05-05 |accessdate=2010-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, UnitedHealth Group purchased ownership in LearnShare and joined the Board of Management.  Also in this year, LearnShare's LMS was fully functional as an enterprise-wide [[solution]].

LearnShare creates agreements with third-party suppliers of courseware for pay-as-you access through the learning management system. LearnShare offers third party courses at the price of one course at a time.&lt;ref name="PayPerUse"&gt;{{cite web |title=Shipping company joins E-learning consortium that offers a pay-per-use model |publisher=InformationWeek |author=Marianne Kolbasuk McGee |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/business_intelligence/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=15500069 |date=2010-05-24 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007–2016: A Technology Company===
In 2007 LearnShare expanded its software system with modules in Performance Management, Employee Profiles, Succession and Talent Planning, and Analytics. It added the capability to the Learning Management System to integrate virtual classroom training.&lt;ref name="HR"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Best Kept Secret: LearnShare's LMS is a 'Contender' |publisher=HR.com  |url=http://www.hr.com/SITEFORUM?&amp;t=/Default/gateway&amp;i=1116423256281&amp;application=story&amp;active=no&amp;ParentID=1119278002800&amp;StoryID=1182994887344&amp;xref=http://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3DLearnShare+Consortium%26hl%3Den%26rlz%3D1C1_____enUS369US369%26start%3D10%26sa%3DN |date=2010-05-22 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, LearnShare became a management-owned company.

In 2009, it added an online conversion tool to change powerpoint presentations to e-learning courses.

The LearnShare system now includes modules for Performance Management, Succession, and Social Collaboration and Learning.

'''Music education in the United States''' can be traced through historical documentation to the colonial era. Among the Native Americans prior to European and African settlement, music education was entirely oral.

== History ==
The earliest systematic music education in the country was centered on the training of singers for Protestant church services, to lead the congregation in [[psalm]]-singing. In the 18th century, the first singing schools in the country were founded, and a number of legendary traveling singing masters traveled New England, teaching in barns, schoolhouses and other informal locations; these masters included [[Francis Hopkinson]] and [[William Billings]]. By the end of the century, more formal singing schools in cities like [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] became social singing societies.

Public education in the United States first offered music as part of the curriculum in Boston in the 1830s, and it spread through the help of singing teacher [[Lowell Mason]], after he successfully advocated it to the Boston School Committee in 1838. The committee ultimately decided to include music as a curricular subject because it was of a moral, physical, and intellectual nature. Music was considered moral because it played such a part in [[religion]], as well as the fact that it had been documented to produce "happiness, contentment, cheerfulness, and tranquility." It was of a physical nature because singing was exercise for the [[lung]]s. The committee justified music's intellectual nature by stating that it had been studied as a part of the [[quadrivium]] in the Middle Ages, and that it "contributes to memory, comparison, attention, and intellectual faculties."&lt;ref name="Mark"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of American Music Education|last=Mark|first=Michael L.|author2=Charles L. Gary|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield, Publishing, Inc|year=2007|isbn=|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=13-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another advocate of music in public education was Swiss educational reformer [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]]. Pestalozzi believed that nature was the ultimate and original source of knowledge, therefore his educational theories placed a high value on sensory, kinesthetic,  and active learning.  He felt students should start with simple concepts in all subjects and move later to more complex ideas.  Pestalozzi's method was one of the earliest methods that could be considered "student-centered learning" and his ideas of discipline and a student-teacher rapport based on love and trust were markedly different from the common practice of corporal punishment at the time.  The first music educator to use Pestalozzian ideas in teaching music was Hans Negeli, a colleague of Pestalozzi in Switzerland.  His Pestalozzian approach to music was brought to the United States, translated, and popularized by [[William Channing Woodbridge]], Elam Ives, and [[Lowell Mason]].  This approach prized active and sensory learning, taught sounds before signs, separated music into melody, rhythm, and expression, and also moved from the simple to complex within the context of each element.  Many of these ideas are found in later established music teaching methods, such as Orff-Schulwerk, Kodaly, and, Dalcroze-Eurthymics.

Music education, primarily vocal, remained most common in women's schools, though many private academies also existed, offering boys and girls instruction in orchestral instruments like the [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]] and [[piano]].

In the mid-19th century, educator [[Luther Whiting Mason]] established music education in the schools of [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], and become a prominent author of textbooks. His ''National Music Course'', first published in 1870, was a widely adopted standard part of many American curricula. Music education continued to expand across the country, and gained in respect as an essential part of educational development.  There was a music section in the [[National Education Association]] by the 1890s.

=== The scientific method and how it affected music ===
After the Civil War, pragmatism and the scientific aspects of sequential skill building, accurate evaluations, examinations, systematic teaching methods, and scientific methods were popular in education.  Music educators' responses showed that music could be studied scientifically through the use of different methodologies, systematic textbooks and [[List of Graded Music Series|graded music series]], and instructional material for teachers.  The scientific and more pragmatic goals of education in the nineteenth century had a profound effect on the development of music education in the schools.

=== Two methodologies: rote vs. note ===
[[File:Lowell_Mason_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_18444.jpg|thumb|right|Lowell Mason]]
[[File:Luther_Whiting_Mason.jpg|thumb|right|Luther Whiting Mason]]
Two main methodologies used to teach music were the "rote" method and the "note" method.  The rote method followed many Pestalozzian ideologies.  Songs were taught first and musical ideas were presented later, one at time, carefully and systematically.  Singing by rote was the basis for this methodology. Lowell Mason authored what is believed to be the first music series using the rote method. [[Lowell Mason|Lowell Mason's]] ''The Song Garden'' from 1864 set the stage for other rote methodologies of the late nineteenth century. [[Luther Whiting Mason]] was a prominent rote method name presented in the textbook. Luther Mason was employed in Cincinnati schools but later moved to Boston to be the "superintendent of music in the primary schools"&lt;ref name=Mark/&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;195). Luther Mason wrote school textbooks using rote methodology.  The National Music Course, published by Ginn in 1870, had seven books  presented in a sequential approach of using rote songs to teach music reading.&lt;ref name=Mark/&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;196)  Luther Mason included very detailed lesson plans for the classroom teacher, since at the time music was taught by the classroom teacher but overseen by a music specialist. The series was designed for fifteen minutes of music instruction each day given by the classroom teacher and overseen by a music educator once per week.  The book series was so popular Luther Mason was invited to apply his methods in Japan and Germany. The rote method was less favored than the "note" method later in the nineteenth century.  However, the debate continues today.

An example of the note method is Joseph Bird's 1861 ''Vocal Music Reader'' and  Benjamin Jepson's three book series using "note" methodology.  ''The Elementary Music Reader'' was published in 1871&lt;ref name=Mark/&gt; by the Barnes Company, one year after Luther Mason's ''The National Music Course''. Benjamin Jepson was a military man turned music teacher in New Haven after  an injury in the war. His music textbooks had exercises and songs presented systematically for the goal of music reading and sight-singing. Jepson later published two revisions of his series under the names ''The Standard Music Reader'' in 1888, and in 1904 ''The New Standard Music Reader''.&lt;ref name=Mark/&gt;  Following in Jepson's footsteps of note methodology were Hosea Edson Holt and John Wheeler Tufts, who wrote ''The Normal Music Course'' published in 1883 (twelve years after Jepson's ''The Elementary Music Reader''). [https://books.google.com/books?id=e30BAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Hosea+holt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7JH7DwEs82&amp;sig=HBoH0uyoxflyQXpnmuw-4_jvwvA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kVttTcXpLZCXtwfDqtzVBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Click here to read the Normal Music Course.] This series had five books all geared toward sight-singing and reading music. A few other note methodology textbook were presented to show the seriousness of music reading as a scientific and pragmatic study.  These other note methodology books included: ''The Graded School Singer'' by Blackman and Whittemore-1873,  and the Cincinnati Schools''' The Young Singer''-1860, ''The Young Singer's Manual''-1866, and the ''Cincinnati Music Reader''-1893&lt;ref name=Mark/&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;207). The culmination of the scientific method and note methodology advances was presented in Thomas Tapper's and Frederick Ripley's ''The National Music Course'' published in 1895. The book focused on a no-nonsense systematic approach to music literacy to develop beauty in singing.  It emphasized the systematic and pragmatic delivery of materials.

[[File:Hayden.jpg|thumb|right|Philip C. Hayden]]
Music Education in the United States took a big turn with the creation of the Music Supervisors National Conference.  The first meeting of the Music Supervisors Conference was held on April 10–12, 1907 in [[Keokuk, Iowa]], at Westminster Presbyterian Church.  A music educator by the name of [[Philip C. Hayden]] made the first meeting possible by sending invitations and announcing the meeting in the ''Music School Monthly'' of which Hayden was the founder and editor of the publication.  The gathering was primarily meant for educators to come observe new teaching techniques in rhythm and observe Hayden's music students.

During the three-day convention, music demonstrations took place provided by Hayden and his students. Informal discussions on current topics in music education would also take place during the convention.  Future conventions and clinics would be based on this model.  Throughout the convention, many educators discussed the importance of having a more permanent organization dedicated to music supervisors and teaching techniques.  On the last day of the convention, a forum of sixty-nine music supervisors voted to have another convention and became charter
members of an organization that would remain nameless.

The Music Supervisors National Conference was officially established during the third meeting of the organization in Cincinnati, OH, in 1910 with the adoption of the constitution and bylaws.  As the role of the music supervisor changed into more of an administrative position, the conference began to focus primarily on the teaching methods provided in the classroom. At the 1934 Chicago meeting, members decided to change the name to [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education|Music Educators National Conference]].

Since the inception of Music Supervisors National Conference, the organization has worked diligently in making sure that every student has access to music instruction in the public school system provided by a qualified music teacher.

Vocal instruction dominated public schooling at all levels. Instrumental education was handled largely through private enterprise, until the early 20th century. Inspired by the band music of [[Frederick Innes]], [[John Philip Sousa]] and others, many schools offered orchestral instrument bands. This accelerated following World War I, when many soldiers returned with knowledge and interest in the band music they learned as soldiers.

The first formal school for music educators was founded in 1884, in [[Potsdam (town), New York|Potsdam, New York]], by [[Julia Ettie Crane]], but [[Oberlin Conservatory]] in Ohio in the 1920s became the first school to offer a four-year degree in music education.

== Concert and marching bands ==

=== All-girl high school, military, and performance bands ===

Bands during the mid to late nineteenth century were an intricate part of every community. These bands would march in parades, provide free concerts, supported soldiers, and played for those in hospitals.&lt;ref name=Sullivan /&gt;  During the golden age of bands which occurred from 1865 to 1917, there were approximately over 10,000 brass bands in existence across the country. The band membership did consist of males, but past photographs indicate that there were also all women bands. The female bands continued their popularity into the twentieth century and influenced the evolution of the high school band from totally male to the integration of female into the programs. High schools often housed the standard male band, but also often included a female band. There were also female bands created to support industry. With the beginning of WW II
female bands expanded into women's military bands. These bands were created to entertain female troops, sell war bonds, and perform at concerts, graduations, dances, parades, and hospitals (2008). The WAC (Woman's Army Corp) bands were used to entertain injured soldiers returning from the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=J.M.|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2007|volume=44|issue=3|pages=282–305|doi=10.1093/jmt/44.3.282|title=Music for the Injured Soldier: A Contribution of American Women's Military Bands During World War II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One Ohio music educator, Joan A. Lamb, provided great contributions to world of military bands. Lamb was a public music teacher until enrolling in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps later known as WAC. In her basic training, she was asked to become a candidate for officer, but she insisted she had joined to play in the WAC band. She was even sent to a psychiatrist because of her persistence in the effort to become a member of the band. Finally, she located the WAC band director, auditioned for him with her oboe, and was immediately reassigned to the band. Lamb held several music positions within the band which was a first for women. She graduated from Army Music School, directed the 400th WAC Band, started an African American WAC Band, and performed in the Armed Forces Radio Orchestra. After her service in the WACS, she returned to her life as a music teacher, educator, and administrator in Los Angeles public schools where she served for 30 years.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=J.M.|date=2006|year=2006|title=Women's Military Bands in a Segregated Army: The 400th and 404th WAC Bands|url=|journal=Journal of Band Research|volume=41|issue=2|pages=1–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African American women also wanted to serve in the WAC Band.  A 404 WAC Band was created. The WAC branch of the military was the only branch who allowed African American female bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=J. M.|title=Women's military bands in a segregated army: the 400th WAC bands|journal=Journal of Band Research|year=2006|volume=41|issue=2|pages=1–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coast Guard also created their version of the female band. The SPAR Band played for the troops and performed many of the same activities as the WAC Band. After the war, the SPAR Band was disbanded and the Coast Guard again became all male. After the war, the female SPAR band members became teachers, performers, and parents. There were some female members of the WAC and SPAR military bands who used the G.I Bill to go to college while others continued performing professionally post war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hersey|first=J.R|author2=Sullivan, J.M.|title=A history of the United States Coast Guard SPAR band|journal=Journal of Historical Research in Music Education|year=2009|volume=30|issue=2|pages=33–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the war, women's swing bands also became popular replacing the male counterpart serving in the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=J.M.|title=A century of women's bands in America|journal=Music Educators Journal|year=2008|volume=95|issue=1|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These swing bands were highly successful and were well received by the public longing for a diversion from the war effort.

[[The Ingenues]] was an all-girl jazz band popular in the late 1920s through the 1930s. This performing band would often perform in vaudeville and variety theaters. [[Anna Mae Winburn]] was an African American band leader of an all-girl jazz band in the International Sweethearts of Rhythm.  [[Frances Klein]] was another famous female instrumentalist of the 30's and 40's who played in Kermit Dart's All-Girl Band, under the direction of Irene Vermillion.

The women military bands and post war all-girl bands opened the door to more female participation in instrumental music. Through the efforts of these frontier-like women, perspectives changed as to the female purpose and level of reliability. Suddenly, female bands were found to be as entertaining as male bands. Women found a place and purpose in the entertainment world. Women who were thought to only have the ability to be mothers were leaders in the music world. Women's equality began to emerge during this time in history and music was a primary avenue for the movement. These women of the past created an environment which the women of today now enjoy. This environment is one of fairness and the ability to seek success in all career areas. Women of today attend college and may become professionals in the work force. Women like Joan Lamb conquered what had in the past seemed like a forbidden world.

=== High school music programs during World War II ===

=== Collegiate band service organizations ===

The entrance of the United States into [[World War I]] (1917–1918) prompted the Wilson administration to promote a "patriotic mind-set.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tischler|first=B.L.|title=One Hundred Percent Americanism and Music in Boston during World War I|journal=American Music|year=1986|volume=4|issue=2|pages=164–176|doi=10.2307/3051979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community singing of patriotic songs such as "America" and "The Star Spangled Banner" were popular outlets for citizens as a way to promote "...strong community efforts of all kinds"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gary|first=C.L.|title=A Treasury of American Song|journal=Music Educators Journal|year=2002|volume=88|issue=6|pages=33–37+61}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also assisted immigrants to learn English.&lt;ref name=Mark/&gt; In addition to community singing, concert bands and marching bands were also used to promote patriotism for "maintenance of civilian morale.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=L.B.|title=How Can the School Band Serve in Defense?|journal=Music Educators Journal|year=1942|volume=28|issue=4|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; College and university marching bands were also culturally influential during and after World War I, especially in the Midwest of the United States.&lt;ref name=SMB&gt;{{Cite web | last = Spartan Marching Band | title = History | url = http://www.spartanband.net/history.html | date = 25 October 2009 | accessdate = 18 March 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110718223119/http://www.spartanband.net/history.html | archivedate = 18 July 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the war, members of these collegiate bands were looking for ways to "develop good will, fellowship and understanding...and recognize the value of dedicated leadership."&lt;ref name=KKYWeb&gt;{{Cite web | last = Kappa Kappa Psi National Honorary Band Fraternity | title = Who is Kappa Kappa Psi? | url=http://www.kkpsi.org/whoiskkpsi.asp | year = 2011 | accessdate = 18 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two leading band service organizations were established to fit that calling, the [[Kappa Kappa Psi]] fraternity (ΚΚΨ) and the [[Tau Beta Sigma]] sorority (ΤΒΣ).

[[File:1920's band on football field.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=The University of Detroit Band at Dinan Field in the 1920s.|The University of Detroit Band at Dinan Field in the 1920s.]]
Kappa Kappa Psi was the first of those organizations, established on November 27, 1919 at Oklahoma A &amp; M College.&lt;ref name=KKYBook&gt;{{cite book |last=Kappa Kappa Psi|title= National Guide to Membership: Kappa Kappa Psi National Honorary Band Fraternity. |publisher= Kappa Kappa Psi |location=Stillwater, OK |year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strong sense of patriotism during World War I was wearing off in the U.S., and the band members of the university wanted to continue to advocate band music.&lt;ref name=KKYWeb/&gt; Ten collegiate band members were selected including the band leader William A. Scroggs by the director of the ensemble, Bohumil "Boh" Makovsky.&lt;ref name=KKYBook/&gt; The fraternity quickly became national with the addition of the [[University of Washington]] and [[Montana State University – Bozeman|Montana State College]] in 1920.&lt;ref name=KKYBook/&gt; Since 1919, Kappa Kappa Psi members have been advocating, supporting and serving over 200 higher education institutions with around 5,000 active members each year.&lt;ref name=KKYWeb/&gt; Famous fraternal brothers include [[John Philip Sousa]], [[Karl King]], and [[William Revelli]].&lt;ref name=KKYWeb/&gt;

There are currently five distinctive purposes for Kappa Kappa Psi today which include: (1) promoting the existence and welfare of secondary school bands and cultivate a respect for their endeavors, (2) honoring outstanding band members through fraternal membership, (3) stimulating campus leadership and respect through positive conduct, (4) fostering a positive bond among collegiate bands and a high level or performance achievement, and (5) providing a positive social experience to all involved in college bands or other musical organizations.&lt;ref name=KKYWeb/&gt;

Collegiate bands in the 1920s were the domain of young men. Women were rarely involved, if at all.&lt;ref name=TBEBook&gt;{{cite book |last=Tau Beta Sigma|title= Tau Beta Sigma. National Guide to Membership Education: Tau Beta Sigma National Honorary Band Sorority. |publisher= Tau Beta Sigma |location=Stillwater, OK |year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the progressive movement of the U.S. was developing, bands became less militaristic and were accepting more women in the 1930s. Even with the progressive movement, some higher education bands held out much longer as a men only ensemble. [[Michigan State University]] did not admit women into the [[Spartan Marching Band]] until 1972.&lt;ref name=SMB/&gt;

Tau Beta Sigma sorority was established on March 26, 1946,&lt;ref name=TBEWeb&gt;{{Cite web | last = Tau Beta Sigma National Honarary Band Sorority. | title = About | url = http://www.tbsigma.org/history.html | date = 5 December 2007 | accessdate = 18 March 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716154103/http://www.tbsigma.org/history.html | archivedate = 16 July 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; twenty seven years after Kappa Kappa Psi. The charter institution was [[Oklahoma State University]], renamed from Oklahoma A &amp; M, after the organization decided it would be easier to start in Oklahoma rather than Texas.&lt;ref name=TBEBook/&gt; A major circumstance for creating a band service organization for women was simply due to the fact that more women were now involved with university bands in the United States. [[Wava Banes]] along with some other women classmates at [[Texas Tech University]] approached their director, D. O. Wiley about forming a "group of bandswomen"&lt;ref name=TBEWeb/&gt; in 1937. The local organization was formalized as Tau Beta Sigma and structured after the Kappa Kappa Psi fraternity.&lt;ref name=TBEWeb/&gt;

Tau Beta Sigma petitioned Kappa Kappa Psi to become a chapter under their national fraternity in 1943, however a complete constitution re-write and difficulties associated with the U.S. entrance in [[World War II]] led Kappa Kappa Psi to suggest that Tau Beta Sigma form their own organization just as they had done in 1919.&lt;ref name=TBEBook/&gt; Due to complications with Texas corporation laws of 1945, [[A. Frank Martin]] from Kappa Kappa Psi suggested using a similar women group at Oklahoma State University (OSU) as the founding chapter for Tau Beta Sigma.&lt;ref name=TBEWeb/&gt; One month after OSU's charter was granted, the women traveled back to Texas to install the founding women of Tau Beta Sigma.&lt;ref name=TBEWeb/&gt; Kappa Kappa Psi was able to convene in 1947 and officially accepted Tau Beta Sigma as their sister sorority.&lt;ref name=TBEBook/&gt;

Both organizations grew in the post-World War II era. Society was still evolving and changing and women's rights became front and center in 1972 with the passage of the [[Title IX]] law.&lt;ref name=MARGARET&gt;{{Cite web | last = The MARGARET Fund of the National Women's Law Center | title = History of Title IX. | url=http://www.titleix.info/History/History-Overview.aspx | year = 2011 | accessdate = 18 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This law "requires gender equity for boys and girls in every educational program that receives federal funding."&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{Cite web | last = Walker | first = T. | title = Closing the Gender Gap. | url=http://neatoday.org/2010/06/23/closing-the-gender-gap | date = 23 June 2010 | accessdate = 18 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since both groups were federally funded, women were allowed to join Kappa Kappa Psi and men were allowed to join Tau Beta Sigma. Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma are still active today and strive to promote the bands they are associated with as their founders did over a half century ago.

== Modern secondary education ==

Music is generally optional in high school in the United States, and may or may not be required in middle or junior high school. [[Concert band]]s and [[marching band]]s are also commonly offered, as are choirs and theatrical performances that often include music.

===Music education reform===
In 2015 a study was released from 2010 showing that according to the U.S. Department of Education, 40 percent of high schools don't require coursework in the arts for graduation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/blog/2012/04/ed-releases-new-report-on-arts-education-in-u-s-public-schools/&lt;/ref&gt; More than 8,000 public schools in the US are currently without music programs as of 2010. Across the country, 1.3 million elementary school students don't have access to a music class.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music as a core subject==

=== History ===
According to the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education,]]&lt;ref name = "Title IX"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/pg107.html|title=Title IX — General Provisions|date=|website=|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the core academic subjects studied in schools are currently English, reading or language arts, mathematics, science, foreign languages, civics and government, economics, arts, history, and geography.&lt;ref name="Title IX" /&gt; In order to teach a core subject in the United States, one must be a [[Highly qualified teachers|Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT)]], meaning they must have a bachelor's degree from a four-year institution, be licensed in the state in which they wish to teach, and be fully competent in their subject area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12.wa.us/titleiia/HighlyQualifiedTeachers.aspx|title=|date=|website=Highly Qualified Teachers|publisher=k12.wa.us|access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, individual competencies vary from state-to-state. Historically, music and fine arts had not been a part of core curriculum in schools in the United States, however, in July 2015, the [[United States Senate]], passed a bipartisan revision naming music and art core subjects in curriculum under the Every Child Achieves Act.&lt;ref name = "NAfME"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nafme.org/senate-passes-every-child-achieves-act-with-music-and-arts-as-core-subjects-in-tact/|title=Senate Passes Every Child Achieves Act, with Music and Arts as Core Subjects, Intact - National Association for Music Education (NAfME)|date=2015-07-16|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The core subjects that were added were "technology, engineering, computer science, music, and physical education."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bsomusic.org/stories/us-senate-designates-music-as-a-core-subject-what-does-that-mean.aspx|title=U.S. Senate Designates Music as a Core Subject, What Does That Mean?|website=www.bsomusic.org|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an action against the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], which many United States Education Advocates felt had narrowed down the subjects incorporated into the core curriculum. The No Child Left Behind Act was initially entitled the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] of 1965, but then was later renamed No Child Left Behind in 2002. The [[National Association for Music Education]], or [[National Association for Music Education|NAfME]], is an "organization of American music educators dedicated to advancing and preserving music education and as part of the core curriculum of schools in the United States." The NAfME is an organization founded in 1907 of more than 60,000 people who advocate for the benefits of music and arts education for students at the local, state, and national levels.&lt;ref name="NAfME" /&gt; NAfME published a press release with the bipartisan senate revision and the impact they believe it will have on the United States Core Curriculum.

=== Implementation ===
Music is implemented as an academic subject in schools around the world, in places such as Greece, Germany, Slovenia, Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=García|first=J.A. Rodríguez-Quiles y|last2=Dogani|first2=K.|date=2011-01-01|title=Music in schools across Europe: analysis, interpretation and guidelines for music education in the framework of the European Union.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235935364_Music_in_schools_across_Europe_analysis_interpretation_and_guidelines_for_music_education_in_the_framework_of_the_European_Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; India, and Africa. This is not a comprehensive, as music is considered a cultural necessity in many countries worldwide. Although the NAfME addresses the plan for implementation for music and arts as core subjects at the national level, the fulfillment of this revision of the Every Child Achieves Act varies from state to state. As of 2014, forty-one states currently have an arts education requirement at all levels, but only seventeen of these states have programs with deliberate assessment policies. Twenty-seven of the fifty United States consider the arts a core subject. Georgia and Arkansas have very specific outlines of music, while Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Michigan, and D.C. have no arts instruction requirements for any level of schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/state_edwatch/2014/03/roughly_half_of_states_consider_arts_a_core_subject_new_report_finds.html?cmp=SOC-SHR-FB|title=Roughly Half of States Consider Arts a "Core" Subject, New Report Finds|last=Andrew Ujifusa|website=Education Week - State EdWatch|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impacts on childhood development and academic success===
Many policymakers and initiators for music and the arts as a part of the core curriculum believe that students participating in music and arts programs which hold them to high standards will bring a creative outlook now seemingly required in the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.americansforthearts.org/2014/06/04/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-national-core-arts-standards|title=What You Need To Know About the New National Core Arts Standards|website=ARTS Blog|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since music has traditionally been viewed as a subject outside of academia, and music has been incorporated into schools as a secondary subject, or often as an elective, there is limited research on classroom benefits of music as a core subject. Many researchers have explored both the benefits to listening to music passively as well as pursuing music actively, as with learning an instrument. The benefits music in the classroom and its effects on brain development, academic performance, and practical life skills have been observed through research by [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED442707.pdf Jenny Nam Yoon]. She concluded that the two hemispheres of the brain are stimulated when music is played and how the corpus callosum, the bridge that connects the two hemispheres is larger in musician's brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoon|first=Jenny Nam|date=2000|title=Music in the Classroom: Its Influence on Children's Brain Development, Academic Performance, and Practical Life Skills|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED442707.pdf|journal=Biola University|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=26 July 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critiques===
Although the US Senate has endorsed music as a core subject, many, including Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander, argue music and the arts to be extra-curricular.&lt;ref name="bsomusic.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bsomusic.org/stories/us-senate-designates-music-as-a-core-subject-what-does-that-mean.aspx|title=U.S. Senate Designates Music as a Core Subject, What Does That Mean?|website=www.bsomusic.org|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many also believe that among Federal budget cuts, music and the arts would be the first to go because they are not part of our foundation of core curriculum in America.&lt;ref name="bsomusic.org"/&gt; The benefits of music as a core subject and its impact on the education system through the arithmetic, language, concentration, and other skills involved still have to be assessed before conclusions can be drawn about the concrete, measurable impacts music and the arts have on children in the United States public school system.

The funding of music education has been debated in the United States due to budget cuts to music programs and varying beliefs on learning priorities in public schools.&lt;ref name="Slaton2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slaton|first1=Emily Dawn|title=Collegiate Connections: Music Education Budget Crisis|journal=Music Educators Journal|date=September 2012|volume=99|issue=1|pages=33–35|doi=10.1177/0027432112454837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of increasing federal funds for music education have argued that music provides children with cognitive and emotional benefits, such as improving spatial and temporal brain functions, which may help them succeed in other school subjects.&lt;ref name="Slaton2012"/&gt; Socially, advocates describe music as something that provokes peace, passion, and reduces stress, which they feel provides multiple benefits to students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Rebecca|title=The Time is Now. (Forum Focus: Arts Awareness and Advocacy).|journal=American Music Teacher|date=December 2003|volume=53|issue=3|pages=56–57|jstor=i40140848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of increasing federal funding believe that music is not important enough to warrant federal financial support, as they view it as a waste of tax dollars.&lt;ref name="Gillespie2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/10/08/what-federal-spending-are-we-better-off-without/government-waste-from-arts-funding-to-education-and-defense|title=Government Waste, From Arts Funding to Education and Defense|last1=Gillespie|first1=Nick|date=October 8, 2013|agency=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some assert that music programs distract students from gaining practical skills and takes money away from more useful areas, where funds could be more wisely spent.&lt;ref name="Slaton2012" /&gt; Others argue that the research showing cognitive or academic benefits stemming from music is unproven and needs to be further investigated before reaching a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=See|first1=Beng Huat|title=Arts Education May Be Important, But The Academic Benefits Are Unproven|url=https://theconversation.com/arts-education-may-be-important-but-the-academic-benefits-are-unproven-50496|website=theconversation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern elementary education ==
Elementary schools in the United States typically offer music classes several times a week, with classes ranging from thirty to forty-five minutes in length. Beginning in about fourth grade, performance opportunities are often provided in the form of choirs or orchestral (especially wind) bands.
There are several  developed teaching methods intended for use in elementary schools.  The Kodaly Method was developed in Hungary by Zoltan Kodaly.   The Orff-Schulwerk Method was developed by Carl Orff, the German composer who wrote Carmina Burana.  The Dalcroze-Eurythmics Method was developed in Switzerland by  Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, who was teaching at the Geneva Conservatory at the time.  All three methods place an emphasis on activity and learning by doing.  The Kodaly Method is known best for its use of solfege syllables and corresponding hand signals.  The Orff-Schulwerk Method is most famous for its use of varying sizes of xylophones and glockenspiels, known as "Orff instruments."  The Dalcroze-Eurythimics Method's most visible characteristic is its use of movement to music, ideally live music.

In a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Education, OECD, it is explained that the amount of time students typically spend in school during primary and lower secondary levels is 7,751 hours. Of these 7,751 hours, the schools surveyed for the report spent eleven percent of the time of the whole year on the arts in elementary schools, and only eight percent of the time on the arts in lower secondary schools. This report also explains that the arts classes combined receive almost the same amount of time as physical education classes do, which is between eight and nine percent for both levels of schooling. ("How")
	
The United States Department of Education conducted a survey of 1,201 secondary schools during the 2009-2010 school year, Parsad explains. This survey reported that the majority of secondary teachers teaching the different arts classes were specialists in their field (Parsad). In a secondary investigation, the United States Department of Education concluded that 94 percent of elementary schools offered instruction in music, and 83 percent of schools offered instruction in the visual arts in elementary schools during the same time period. Drama and dance classes were offered to only three and four percent of the elementary schools involved in the study, but more than half of the schools incorporated dance into other subjects (Parsad). Art and music classes were offered to elementary students at least once per week, Parsad explains.

== Introduction of technology ==
[[File:Girl listening to radio.gif|thumb|Girl listening to radio in late 1930s]]
Throughout the history of music education, many music educators have adopted and implemented technology in the classroom. Alice Keith and D.C. Boyle were said to be the first music educators in the United States to use the radio for teaching music. Keith wrote ''Listening in on the Masters'', which was a broadcast music appreciation course.&lt;ref name="Mark"&gt;Mark, Michael L., and Charles L. Gary. A History of American Music Education. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another advocate who promoted the use of technology was Marguerite V. Hood, who was born on March 14, 1903 in Drayton, [[North Dakota]]. Hood graduated high school early, at the age of sixteen. She then attended [[Jamestown College]], in Jamestown, North Dakota where she graduated with degrees in romance languages and music, and minors in history and English.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3648428 Marguerite V. Hood and Music Education Radio Broadcasts in Rural Montana], Cooper, Shelly. "Marguerite V. Hood and Music Education Radio Broadcasts in Rural Montana (1937-39)." Journal of Research in Music Education Vol. 53.No. 4 (2005): 295-307. JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hood's professional career led her to [[Montana]] in 1923, where she pursued teaching, writing, and public speaking. In 1930, Hood became Montana's second state music supervisor. 
During Hood's teaching career, the radio was used as an educational tool. Montana received poor radio reception because of the mountain interference, so Hood created local radio station broadcasts. Hood began the music education radio broadcast project, ''Montana School of the Air'', in 1937. These broadcasts aired weekly on four radio stations.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; Using the radio for educational broadcasts received positive reviews because it allowed students to be reached all over the United States during the unstable time of the [[Great Depression]]. Radios were cost effective and could reach isolated, rural schools.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;
 
[[The National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC) played a major role in music education. NBC would broadcast musical examples for students enrolled in public school. [[Walter Damrosch]] directed the radio program, ''Music Appreciation Hour''. In the course of this broadcast, teachers were able to obtain the musical selections in advance along with student notebooks and teacher instruction manuals.&lt;ref name="Mark" /&gt; Two other popular music broadcast programs were ''Alice in Orchestralia'' and the ''Standard Symphony Hour''. These broadcasts were an innovative teaching strategy which promoted and encouraged active listening and music appreciation. Prior to the radio, listening to music was limited to live performances and the skill of the teacher to play music, specifically on the piano.&lt;ref name="Weidenbach"&gt;Weidenbach, Vanda. "Innovations in Music Education." Primary Educator Vol. 3.No. 1 (1997). Professional Development Collection. Web. 15 Mar. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of the radio in the 1930s can similarly be compared to some of today's technology, such as iPods, compact discs, and computers. Technology has become much more widely available in the classroom since the 1930s. Today, children have access to many musical devices and options that were not available in the 1930s. In essence, technology has been used in music classrooms throughout the United States with the intent to improve the quality of music education for students.

'''Playing''' or '''learning by ear''' is the ability of a performing [[musician]] to reproduce a piece of [[music]] they have heard, without having seen it [[Musical notation|notated]] in any form of [[sheet music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/play+by+ear|title=Play by ear - Idioms by the Free Dictionary|website=thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is considered to be a desirable skill among musical performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.musical-u.com/learn/topic/how-to/play-by-ear/|title=Playing By Ear: How to learn to play notes and chords by ear - Musical U|website=Musical U|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many forms of [[List of classical and art music traditions|classical music]] throughout the world are fundamentally rooted in the concept of playing by ear, where musical compositions are passed down from generation to generation. In this respect, playing by ear can be also seen as a music-specific example of [[oral tradition]]. However, there are some examples of musical traditions where greater importance is placed on a tradition of [[Writing|writing down]] the music, in some form of [[musical notation]].

The concept of playing by ear has led to the development of the idiom, to [[wikt:play by ear|play by ear]].

== Method ==
Learning music by ear is done by repeatedly listening to other [[musician]]s, either their live shows or [[sound recording]]s of their songs, and then attempting to recreate what one hears.  [[Audiation]] involves hearing sounds mentally, although on a different level than just "hearing a song in one's head". The skill of reproducing those sounds involves the ability to mentally hear and recognize rhythms, tell the interval between a note and a reference note in a melody, play a specific interval between a melodic note and bass note (typically 1, 3, or 5 intervals below the melodic note), and play the notes of a specific chord based on the a given bass note (e.g., notes at 1, 3, and 5 intervals above the bass note).

== Existence in classical music traditions ==
In most instances, those traditions where learning music from playing by ear is paramount do not use [[musical notation]] in any form. Some examples of this such as by early [[Blues]] guitarists and pianists, [[Romani society and culture|Romani]] [[fiddler]]s and [[folk music]] guitarists.
[[File:A group of musicians, North India, c.1870's.jpg|thumb|A group of [[Hindustani classical music|''Hindustani'']] musicians&lt;br&gt;(c. 1870)]]
One particularly prominent example is of [[Indian classical music]], where the teaching methods of its two major strands ([[Hindustani classical music|''Hindustani'']] and [[Carnatic classical music|''Carnatic'']]) are almost exclusively oral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itcsra.org/Indian-Oral-Tradition|title=ITC Sangeet Research Academy - Indian Oral Tradition|website=www.itcsra.org|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Western classical music ===
Historically, the [[Western Classical Music|Western classical music]] tradition has been based on the process of learning new pieces from [[musical notation]], and hence playing by ear has a lower importance in musical training.

However, many teaching methods in this tradition incorporate playing by ear in some form. Examples include the "[[ear training]]" courses that are a standard part of [[music school|conservatory]] or college music programs (including use of [[Solfège]]), and the [[Suzuki method]], which incorporates a highly developed focus on playing by ear from a very young age.

In the [[western world|West]], learning by ear is also associated with the genres of [[folk music]], [[blues]], [[rock music|rock]], and [[jazz]].

'''The Kalsom Movement''' began as '''Projek Kalsom''', a student-led motivational camp for Malaysian youths held annually in August in [[Malaysia]] by Malaysian university student-leaders since 1994. The Kalsom Movement became a fully registered youth-led organisation in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://leaderonomics.com/life-inspired/what-makes-you-an-effective-leader|title=What Makes You An Effective Leader? {{!}} Leaderonomics.com|date=2018-05-02|work=Leaderonomics.com|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, as the organiser of Projek Kalsom, the youth-led education charity continues to focus on developing Malaysia’s future leaders by empowering university students to share their knowledge and skills to help younger economically-disadvantaged Malaysian students achieve their ambitions. In turn, these Malaysian university students also benefit from discovering their own leadership potentials and organisational skills as well as becoming more perceptive of issues surrounding education inequality in Malaysia which will hopefully instil a sense of civic awareness towards their local community and towards the country as whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.edgy.my/nurturing-kalsom-spirit-two-decades|title = Nurturing the Kalsom Spirit two decades on|last = Hamid|first = Shahirah|date = 30 April 2015|work = The Edge|access-date = 23 February 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kalsom Movement's education programmes are open to all Malaysian students regardless of ethnicity, gender, religious or political background.

Every year, The Kalsom Movement brings together the brightest, most talented and academically-gifted 16-year-old Malaysian secondary school students from Band 3 and below schools (underperforming schools), as outlined by the [[Ministry of Education (Malaysia)|Ministry of Education, Malaysia]]) for Projek Kalsom, a week-long programme of English Language modules, careers and scholarship and personal development workshops as well as other education programmes organised by the movement.

A significant proportion of The Kalsom Movement's facilitators are top Malaysian university student-leaders from [[Oxford University]], [[University of Cambridge]] and [[Russell Group]] universities as well as [[Ivy League]] universities such as [[Harvard]], [[Cornell]] and [[Princeton University]].

The idea for a Projek Kalsom motivational camp was initially mooted by a group of Malaysian students in London in 1993 upon reading a newspaper cutting of a Mrs Kelthom Abdullah,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aziz|first1=Hapizah|title=Hidup Kelthom makin terdesak|agency=Utusan Malaysia|date=21 January 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; a single mother living in the rural areas of [[Kelantan]], Malaysia, who could not bear the cost of her children's education. Aside from raising funds for Mrs Kelthom Abdullah, these students decided to organise the first Projek Kalsom motivational camp for underprivileged students in [[Jerantut District|Jerantut, Pahang]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nik Ahmad|first1=Nik Nazmi|title=Moving Forward: Malays for the 21st Century|date=2009|publisher=Mark Cavendish|isbn=978-983-3845-40-8|pages=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of note, as the founders of Projek Kalsom were also the founders of the [http://www.ukeconline.com/ United Kingdom &amp; Eire Council for Malaysian Students] (UKEC), it is not surprising that Projek Kalsom has been associated with UKEC in the past.

Subsequent Projek Kalsom motivational camps were rotated between the 11 states and federal territories of [[West Malaysia]] as a one-off motivational camp annually. In 2012, under the leadership of Dr Hannah Nazri&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Doctor’s Kalsom Story|url=http://www.1malaysia.com.my/en/affiliates/a-doctor%E2%80%99s-kalsom-story|website=1Malaysia.com.my|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2011 Projek Kalsom 17 Director), formerly a medical student of [[University of Bristol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Bristol - Alumni and Friends - The Alumni Association - Who's Involved?|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alumni/the-alumni-association/whos-involved/|website=University of Bristol|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projek Kalsom finally became a registered entity known as Kelab Belia Kalsom under the Registrar of Youth Societies ([[Ministry of Youth and Sports (Malaysia)|Ministry of Youth &amp; Sports, Malaysia]]); ensuring its sustainability and continuity. 2012 also saw the Projek Kalsom motivational camp being held for the first time in [[East Malaysia]], in [[Miri, Sarawak]]. The following year, saw the first [[Bristol, United Kingdom|Bristol]] [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Cultural Programme involving 10 British university students joining Projek Kalsom motivational camp in [[Kuantan District|Kuantan, Pahang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Doctor’s Kalsom Story|url=http://www.1malaysia.com.my/en/affiliates/a-doctor%E2%80%99s-kalsom-story|website=1Malaysia.com.my|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, under the leadership of Mohd Zulikhwan Ayub (2013-2015 Kelab Belia Kalsom President), a medical student at [[University of Aberdeen]], Kelab Belia Kalsom underwent a major transformation phase with an expansion plan of partnerships in place, an increase in the number of volunteer applications by nearly 300%,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thestar.com.my/news/education/2014/11/09/making-adifference/&lt;/ref&gt; an introduction of a one-year Kalsom Harapan plan,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thestar.com.my/news/education/2014/11/09/nurturing-the-inner-potential-in-students/&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a re-branding exercise where the youth-led charity became widely known as The Kalsom Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.edgy.my/nurturing-kalsom-spirit-two-decades|title = Nurturing the Kalsom Spirit two decades on|last = Hamid|first = Shahirah|date = 30 April 2015|work = The Edge|access-date = 23 February 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bhplus.com.my/node/264234|title=Tengku Amir Shah tubuh Football Selangor|last=|first=|date=26 March 2017|work=Berita Harian|access-date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, The Kalsom Movement remained the only student-led organisation to receive support and endorsement from [[Bursa Malaysia]] (formerly [[Kuala Lumpur]] Stock Exchange).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rain fails to dampen spirits at Bursa charity run|url=http://www.nst.com.my/news/2015/09/rain-fails-dampen-high-spirits-bursa-charity-run|accessdate=21 June 2016|agency=New Straits Times Online|date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bursa Bull Charge jana sumbangan RM1.8 juta|url=http://www.hmetro.com.my/node/85184|accessdate=21 June 2016|agency=Harian Metro|date=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, The Kalsom Movement was nominated as one of the Top 10 Organisations (Education and Community) for [[Merdeka Award]], a highly prestigious award in Malaysia.

The 'tour' of all [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|14 states and federal territories of Malaysia]] was completed with the organisation of the 2015 Projek Kalsom 21 in [[Papar, Malaysia|Papar, Sabah]]. In 2015, the movement received 364 applications as facilitators from Malaysian students studying in 15 different countries including the United Kingdom, Ireland, United States of America, Canada, Poland, Spain, Egypt, Indonesia and Malaysia for 40 places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Motivational camp benefits 300 students from Papar|url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=102192|accessdate=21 June 2016|agency=Daily Express|date=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11 international facilitators through the [[Bristol, United Kingdom|Bristol]] [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Cultural Programme (third year running)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bristol Student Commonwealth Society|url=https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/activities/societies/BSCS/|website=University of Bristol Student Union|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fulbright Program|American Fulbright Scholars]] were also selected with a dual aim in mind, to encourage bilateral relationships between the two countries and to encourage English speaking between Projek Kalsom student-participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=11 International Facilitators Add 'Charm' To Projek Kalsom Camp In Sabah|url=http://www.beritadaily.com/news/2015-08-02/18769/eleven-international-facilitators-for-projek-kalsom-in-sabah|accessdate=21 June 2016|agency=Bernama|publisher=Berita Daily|date=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the establishment of The Kalsom Movement, many other education programmes were organised.

==Current Programmes==
Flagship programmes are programmes that are always held annually.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4243">'''Ruth Dianne Hines''' also "Ruth Diana Hines" (1951-; ) was an [[Australia]]n [[Accounting]] academic at [[Macquarie University]] from 1978 to 1994, part of the Alternative or [[Critical Perspectives on Accounting]] movement.  She is best known for her 1988 paper, "Financial Accounting: in Communicating Reality, We Construct Reality".  Google Scholar in August-2018 shows this cited 1214 times (July-2017: 1089), comparing well to the 8160 (July-2017: 7440) of the 1968 "Ball and Brown" paper, winner of the inaugural "Seminal Paper" in Economics award.

Dr. Hines left Academe to write Poetry and Children's Books after gaining her PhD.

While a lecturer at [[Macquarie University]], her PhD was supervised by Prof. Kenneth Peasnell of [[Lancaster University Management School]] (LUMS).

Her 1996 piece "Net profit is a God", is a poem from her PhD Dissertation and was invited for a special edition of AAAJ. It only appears in the printed version of the journal.

She appears to have moved and not contacted friends and ex-colleagues since 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32861">'''Section 504''' of the '''[[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]]''', Pub. L. No. 93-112, 87 Stat. 394 (Sept. 26, 1973), codified at {{usc|29|701}} et seq., is [[United States|American]] [[legislation]] that guarantees certain rights to people with disabilities. It was one of the first U.S. federal civil rights laws offering protection for people with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://dredf.org/504site/histover.html| first= Kitty| last= Cone|title=Short History of the 504 Sit in| website= dredf.org| publisher= Disability Rights Education &amp; Defense Fund| access-date= September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It set precedents for subsequent legislation for people with disabilities, including the Virginians with Disabilities Act in 1985 and the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] in 1990.

==Summary of the Section==
Section 504 states (in part):

&lt;blockquote&gt;No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the [[United States Postal Service]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is codified as 29 U.S.C. 794.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/794- |title= 29 U.S. Code § 794 - Nondiscrimination under federal grants and programs| website= law.cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As amended in 1974, Section 111, Pub L. 93-516, 88 Stat. 1619 (Dec. 7, 1974), ''Individuals with Disabilities'' are:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Any person who (a) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities, (b) has a record of such an impairment, or (c) is regarded as having such an impairment&lt;/blockquote&gt;

where

&lt;blockquote&gt;Major life activities include caring for one's self, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, working, performing manual tasks, and learning.&lt;ref Name="USA Dept of Health&amp;Human Services"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.dhhs.gov/ocr/504.html| publisher= Office for Civil Rights, US Dept. of Health &amp; Human Services| deadurl= yes| title= Your Rights Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act |date= June 2000 |edition= June 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150317090828/http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/resources/factsheets/504.pdf| archivedate= March 17, 2015| website= DHHS.gov| access-date= September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, "For purposes of employment", ''Qualified Individuals with Disabilities'' must also meet "normal and essential eligibility requirements", such that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For purposes of employment, ''Qualified Individuals with Disabilities'' are persons who, with ''Reasonable Accommodation'', can perform the essential functions of the job for which they have applied or have been hired to perform.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

where

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Reasonable Accommodation'' means an employer is required to take reasonable steps to accommodate [one's] disability unless it would cause the employer undue hardship.&lt;ref Name="USA Dept of Health&amp;Human Services" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is, ''Qualified Individuals with Disabilities'' must be able to perform the job duties associated with the job for which they would be hired. The [[United States Department of Labor]] also indicates that "Small Providers" do not have to make "''significant'' structural alterations to their existing facilities" to accommodate individuals with disabilities.&lt;ref Name="USA Dept of Labor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/sec504.htm|title= Section 504, Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. § 701) |publisher= Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management, US Dept. of Labor|work=dol.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ADA (Americans With Disabilities Act) was passed in 1990, and seems to pick up where the Rehabilitation Act left off. Borrowing from the §504 definition of disabled person, and using the familiar three-pronged approach to eligibility (has a physical or mental impairment, a record of an impairment, or is regarded as having an impairment), the ADA applied those standards to most private sector businesses, and sought to eliminate barriers to disabled access in buildings, transportation, and communication. To a large degree, the passage of the ADA supplants the employment provisions of §504, reinforces the accessibility requirements of §504 with more specific regulations".&lt;ref Name="David M. Richards"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.504idea.org/504overview.html#I |title= Overview| first= David M. |last= Richards| publisher= Council of Educators for Students with Disabilities; Richards Lindsay &amp; Martin, L.L.P.| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050204051533/http://www.504idea.org/504overview.html |archivedate= February 4, 2005| access-date= September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Implications ==
Section 504 covers "any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance." If an organization receives federal support of any kind, even if the organization is not a federal or state organization, the organization must comply with Section 504. For example, airports in the United States can be at least partially funded by grants from federal and state governments, thus must be compliant. In many communities, public libraries receive federal financial assistance, directly or indirectly, so they must comply as well. Airports and public libraries became accessible according to Section 504 stipulation within a few years of the implementation of Section 504.

== Requirements for educational programs ==

===Higher education ===
The intention of Section 504 was to impact employment of people with disabilities, thus included education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973: Prohibiting Discrimination Against Individuals with Disabilities in Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Assistance|url=http://www.llsdc.org/assets/sourcebook/crs-rl34041.pdf|website=Law Librarians' Society|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 504 was the first national civil rights legislation that provided equal access for students with disabilities to higher education institutions receiving federal financial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=L.M.|last2=Belch|first2=H.A.|title=Setting the context: Reconsidering the principles of full participation and meaningful access for students with disabilities|journal=New Directions for Student Services|date=2000|volume=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both public and private colleges and universities supported by federal grants and funding programs must comply with Section 504. The common way higher education institutions are linked to federal funds is through the federal student aid programs. Initially, colleges, universities, and community colleges complied with the regulations imposed by Section 504 in the late-1970s and early to mid-1980s.

Higher education institutions are required to make their programs accessible to qualified students with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Connor|first1=D.J.|title=Helping students with disabilities transition to college: 21 times for students with LD and/or ADD/ADHD|journal=TEACHING Exceptional Children|date=2012|volume=44|issue=5|pages=16–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualified students with disabilities are determined by the admissions criteria of the individual higher education institution. Students wishing to receive accommodations must initiate the process, which varies per higher education institution. This process largely subscribes to the [[medical model of disability]], as many higher education institutions require medical documentation of diagnosis and functioning regarding the disability during the accommodation application process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hadley|first1=W|title=College student with disabilities: A student development perspective|journal=New Directions for Higher Education|date=2011|volume=154|issue=Summer}}&lt;/ref&gt; These colleges and universities are required to make reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities who attend their institutions.

=== K–12 schools ===
The law also pertains to any "local educational agency (as defined in section 8801 of Title 20), system of vocational education, or other school system".&lt;ref Name="USA Dept of Labor" /&gt;  As applied to K–12 schools, "the language broadly prohibits the denial of public education participation, or enjoyment of the benefits offered by public school programs because of a child's disability."&lt;ref Name="David M. Richards" /&gt;  Although the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) also applies to K-12 schools, the existence of IDEA does not mean the Rehabilitation Act is superfluous. IDEA only protects a subset of children and youth who have disabilities—those who satisfy its definition for "child with a disability".&lt;ref Name="34 CFR § 300.8"&gt;Title 34—Education § 300.8 "Child with a disability means a child . . . having mental retardation, a hearing impairment (including deafness), a speech or language impairment, a visual impairment (including blindness), a serious emotional disturbance (referred to in this part as ''emotional disturbance''), an orthopedic impairment, autism, traumatic brain injury, an other health impairment, a specific learning disability, deaf-blindness, or multiple disabilities, and who, by reason thereof, needs special education and related services."&lt;/ref&gt;  The definition of disability under Section 504 is broader than that of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]], so some children who do not meet the IDEA definition of disability are served under Section 504.

Section 504 requires school districts to provide [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] (FAPE) to children with disabilities, who may benefit from public education, within the individual district's jurisdiction. Regardless of the child's disability, the school district must identify the child's educational needs and provide any regular or special education to satisfy the child's educational needs just as well as it does for the children without disabilities. This may be accomplished by developing an education plan for the child. When done so under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, it is referred to as a 504 plan. This 504 plan covers accommodations, services, and support the child will be receiving in order to have access to education at school. A 504 plan is different and less detailed than an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEPs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Difference Between IEPs and 504 Plans|url=https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/special-services/504-plan/the-difference-between-ieps-and-504-plans|website=Understood: for learning &amp; attention issues|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 504 supports rights for students for needs outside of the school day, such as extracurricular activities, sports, and after-school care, because Section 504 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. While the process for accommodating students varies per institution, schools generally comply with Section 504 by identifying students with disabilities and evaluating those students. If the students are eligible, they create a written accommodation plan, often called a "504 Plan." It is similar to, but often shorter than, the IDEA [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP). Parents, teachers, and school staff are a part of the process. Parents have due process rights; where they disagree with the determinations of the school, they have a right to an impartial hearing.

Violations of Section 504 in the educational environment can be addressed locally with the education agency or with the [http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/index.html?src=oc Office for Civil Rights] (OCR) of the U.S. Department of Education. Violations of Section 504 can result in a loss of the federal funding. According to the Department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/504faq.html#interrelationship|title=Protecting Students With Disabilities|work=ed.gov| publisher= US Dept. of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; individuals may also file a private right of action for violations of Sec. 504. Thus, Section 504 is enforced by OCR. IDEA is carried out by another unit of the Department, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP).

=== Extracurricular activity ===
Section 504 covers extracurricular and after school programs such as sports, music lessons, and [[day care|afterschool care]]. [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title34/34cfr104_main_02.tpl 34 C.F.R. § 104].37.

==Rights under Section 504==
Although not in the text of the statute, courts have held that individuals have a private right of action under Section 504.{{citation needed|date= September 2016}} While [[punitive damages]] are not available, [[compensatory damages]] are available to plaintiffs.&lt;ref name=BvG&gt;{{cite web| url= http://law.onecle.com/ussc/536/536us186.html |title= ''Barnes  v. Gorman'', 536 U.S. 181 (2002)| page= 185| website= onecle.com | publisher= Onecle Inc.| accessdate= September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably, these rights extend to include emotional distress damages.

In addition to its responsibility for enforcing other federal statutes prohibiting discrimination in housing, the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|US Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) has a statutory responsibility under Section 504 to ensure that individuals are not subjected to discrimination on the basis of disability by any program or activity receiving HUD assistance. Section 504 charges HUD's [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] with enforcing the right of individuals to live in federally subsidized housing free from discrimination on the basis of disability. Further, Section 504 covers employment discrimination based on disability and requires HUD and HUD-assisted agencies to make reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental limitations of an employee or qualified applicant. It covers all HUD programs except for its mortgage insurance and loan guarantee programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/programdescription/sec504 |title= Section 504| website= HUD.gov| publisher= US Dept. of Housing and Urban Development| access-date= August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any housing that receives federal assistance, such as [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] public housing, is subject to Section 504 regulations and requirements. Any person with a disability who feels himself or herself a victim of discrimination in a HUD-funded program or activity may file a complaint with HUD under Section 504. A complaint can be filed with HUD's [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp| title= Fair Housing / Equal Opportunity| website= HUD.gov| publisher= US Dept. of Housing and Urban Development| access-date= August 15, 2013| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120402122117/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Ffair_housing_equal_opp| archivedate= April 2, 2012| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person with disabilities feels subject to discrimination in a housing situation that does not receive federal assistance, they can also file a complaint through the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] and [[Fair Housing Act#Housing discrimination|Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act]].

== History ==

The early history of federal legislation benefiting people with disabilities includes the [[Civilian Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1920 (Smith-Fess Act)]] passed after World War I, one of the first U.S. laws that provided services for all Americans with disabilities, not just veterans with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rds.colostate.edu/history-of-legislation|title=A Brief History of Legislation|last=|first=|date=|website=Resources for Disabled Students|publisher=Colorado State University|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, subsequent laws and amendments included additional vocational rehabilitation measures.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Section 504 brought the language of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] to the Rehabilitation of Act of 1973.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Disability Rights Movement: from Charity to Confrontation|last=Fleischer|first=Doris Zames|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=93|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement|last=Shapiro|first=Joseph|publisher=Three Rivers Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=64–70|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a law that fell within the office of Health, Education, and Welfare, this was an unlikely place for a social justice provision, yet inserting such a rights clause happened without fanfare.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schweik|first=Susan|year=2011|title="Lomax's Matrix: Disability, Solidarity, and theBlack Power of 504"|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/1371|journal=DSQ (Disability Studies Quarterly)|volume=31:1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working behind the scenes on what most believed was a bill related to budget, a staffer added the thirty-five words that addressed issues of discrimination related to disability. This was a departure from prevailing views that considered [[Medical model of disability|disability to be purely a medical condition]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The law prohibited any entity receiving federal funding (such as government offices, schools, universities, hospitals, and post offices) from discriminating against someone because of a disability.

Concerned about costs and enforcement, the Nixon and Ford Administrations attempted to stall the regulations both by rewriting them and calling for further study regarding their impact if they did stay in their present form.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Institutions such as universities and hospitals hoped to avoid bad publicity and huge expenses by waiting out the regulation process.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Activists Handbook: Winning Social Change in the 21st Century,|last=Shaw|first=Randy|publisher=University of California Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=202–208|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disability rights groups, especially the [[American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities (ACCD)]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Disability Protests: Contentious Politics: 1970-1999|last=Barnartt|first=Sharon|last2=Scotch|publisher=Gallaudet University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=164–166|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; understood the implications and advocated to keep them in place unchanged. Section 504 required another step before being implemented (and thus enforced), a signature from the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW). In 1975 a federal lawsuit was filed to force the agency to act. In July 1976, a federal district for Washington DC ruled that the regulations should be issued "with no further unreasonable delays." As the arrival of a new president drew near, HEW Secretary under departing President Gerald Ford, David Matthews, left them unsigned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During his campaign, [[Jimmy Carter]] promised to change this if he was elected president. When he took office in January 1977, he too grew concerned about costs and invited [[Joseph A. Califano Jr.|Joseph Califano]], the new HEW head, to study the legislation and its implications by establishing a task force that did not include representation from ACCD or anyone with a disability.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Word leaked out that the 504 regulations that insisted on full integration of people with disabilities were being changed into something more akin to "separate but equal." ACCD members tried to reach President Carter, who had promised to support disability rights during a campaign speech in [[Warm Springs, Georgia]], a significant location because it had been President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR's]] wheelchair-accessible "home away from home" while he was in the White House. Carter insisted that the matter fell to Califano.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Protests and Outcome ===
After resistance from Joseph Califano to signing the regulations, national protests were organized, which are now known as the [[504 Sit-in]]. Due to the pressure of the protests, Joseph Califano signed the regulations unchanged on April 28, 1977.&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isc.temple.edu/neighbor/ds/disabilityrightstimeline.htm|title=Disability History Timeline|year=2002|publisher=[[Temple University]]|work=Rehabilitation Research &amp; Training Center on Independent Living Management|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220065328/http://isc.temple.edu/neighbor/ds/disabilityrightstimeline.htm|archivedate=2013-12-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/drilm/resources/timeline.html|title=The Regents of the University of California. 2008.

Some also seemed reluctant to leave the disability city, the "mini-Woodstock" they had created.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Faded Scars: My Queer Disability History|last=O'Toole|first=Corbett Joan|publisher=Autonomous Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter 5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites7.sfsu.edu/longmoreinstitute/patient-no-more|title=Patient No More: People with Disabilities Securing Civil Rights," Online Exhibit sponsored by Paul K. Longmore Institute on Disability, San Francisco State University|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 504 Sit-in lasted a total of 25 days, and remains the longest nonviolent occupation of a federal building in U.S. history.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Protesters held a large victory rally in Civic Center Plaza where occupiers sang "We Have Overcome," then toasted with champaign and gave victory speeches. Organizer Kitty Cone captured the mood and the accomplishment by saying: "We showed strength and power and courage and commitment, that we the shut-ins or the shut-outs, that we the hidden, supposedly the frail and the weak, that we could wage a struggle at the highest level of government and win!"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/tags/disability%20rights|title=Kitty Cone Victory Speech|last=Cone|first=Kitty|date=|website=DREDF|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next several years, Section 504 was controversial because it afforded people with disabilities many rights similar to those for other minority groups in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. Throughout the [[Reagan administration]], efforts were made to weaken Section 504. [[Patrisha Wright|Patricia Wright]] and [[Evan Kemp, Jr.]] (of the Disability Rights Center) led a grassroots and lobbying campaign against this that generated more than 40,000 cards and letters.&lt;ref name="Timeline" /&gt; In 1984, the administration dropped its attempts to weaken Section 504; however, they did end the Social Security benefits of hundreds of thousands of disabled recipients.&lt;ref name="Timeline" /&gt;

The protest is considered "perhaps the single most impressive act of civil disobedience in the United States over the last quarter-century."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The success ensured that disability rights would be understood to be a civil right, that disabled people could claim an identity alongside those of racial, ethnic, and gender identities. It has been described as the Stonewall of the disability rights movement because it solidified the American struggle for disability rights. The successful action showed people with disabilities to be capable of grassroots action and ongoing public protest for the first time in history.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} It brought together people with different disabilities to forge coalitions that would work together to draft and pass the 1990s Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

The protests also led Califano to sign the regulations for the 1975 [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]], another law awaiting a signature from the head of HEW after congress had passed it. Along with provisions from 504, this law paved the way for bringing children with disabilities into the educational mainstream, giving them access to better schooling and opportunities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The new law provoked some resistance and backlash from organizations that complained of costs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== 504 trainings ====
As part of the 504 victory, the federal government funded disability activists to travel across the United States to explain to people with disabilities and local officials the rights guaranteed by the law. This helped spread the disability rights movement beyond the San Francisco Bay Area.

==== Section 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) ====
The 504 occupation created a generation of disability rights activists and advocates who would go on to draft the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990]]. The ADA can be viewed as picking up where 504 left off, handling the more difficult, complex situations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Using Section 504 as a template, the framers of the ADA sought to extend provisions that now applied to government to much of the private sector (notably private employers, stores, hotels, and restaurants). The new law also specifically stated that the ADA would not amend or weaken Section 504. Because of being drafted based on 504, the ADA also framed disability in the context of civil rights rather than as a medical need, using terms such as "discrimination," "reasonable accommodation," and "otherwise qualified."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The cross-disability coalitions forged during the 504 protests also ensured that the ADA would employ a broad definition of disability so that it could encompass a wide variety of impairment groups.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Like Section 504, the ADA includes people with psychiatric disabilities, alcoholics, and recovered drug addicts (though current drug users are excluded).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Activists formed by the 504 occupation such as [[Patrisha Wright|Patricia Wrigh]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t spent the next thirteen years building relationships in Washington that would help pave the way for passing the ADA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With thirteen years of Section 504 on the books, framers of the ADA could point to evidence that the earlier law had not led to the massive economic collapse that some had predicted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (115-6)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7255">A '''semester school''' is a [[school]] that complements a student's [[secondary education]] by providing them with the opportunity to step out of their regular school for half an academic year and step into a uniquely different educational setting while continuing their required academic studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semesterschools.net/ Semester Schools Network]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hotchkiss"&gt;[http://www.hotchkiss.org/Academics/Yr-Sem_OCPrograms.asp The Hotchkiss School - Semester Off-Campus Opportunities]&lt;/ref&gt; The academic curriculum at semester schools tends to be college preparatory, interdisciplinary, and experiential.&lt;ref name="NAIS"&gt;[http://www.nais.org/publications/ismagazinearticle.cfm?itemNumber=150703 National Association of Independent Schools: Semester Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611164221/http://www.nais.org/publications/ismagazinearticle.cfm?itemNumber=150703 |date=2011-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PetersonSSGO"&gt;[http://www.petersons.com/common/article.asp?id=1171&amp;path=hs.fas.advice&amp;sponsor=1 Peterson's Semester Schools: Great Opportunities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627023207/http://www.petersons.com/common/article.asp?id=1171&amp;path=hs.fas.advice&amp;sponsor=1 |date=2010-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.privateschoolreview.com/articles/145 Private School Review: Semester Schools]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
*Semester school curricula are built around themes&lt;ref name="NAIS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SSwebsites"&gt;Information from a review of semester school websites&lt;/ref&gt; including [[environmental sustainability]], [[marine ecology]], [[organic farming]], ethics and leadership, [[visual arts]], and others. The curricula tend to be place-based drawing on the resources and opportunities of each school's unique location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegebound.net/content/living-learning-at-semester-schools/ College Bound Network: Living and Learning at Semester Schools]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Semester schools are [[boarding school]]s. Community living is a key element of the experience. Through living closely with peers and teachers and working together to benefit the school community students develop their communication, leadership, and cooperative skills.&lt;ref name="PetersonSSGO" /&gt;
*Semester schools enroll college bound sophomores, juniors, and or seniors. Most semester schools focus primarily on students from just one grade level.&lt;ref name="NAIS" /&gt;
*Semester school programs run from 14 to 18 weeks.&lt;ref name="SSwebsites" /&gt;
*Semester schools tend to be small, enrolling from 15 to 60 students a semester with average class sizes ranging from 5 to 15 students.&lt;ref name="SSwebsites" /&gt;
*Semester schools are [[private school]]s that charge [[tuition]] and offer financial aid. Depending on the school and a student’s family situation the cost can range from no cost to several thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name="NAIS" /&gt;
*Most semester schools are located in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="SSwebsites" /&gt;
*While most semester schools serve students in secondary school or high school, Steward Outdoor School in [[Ivoryton, Connecticut|Ivoryton]], CT serves [[middle school]] students. 

==Benefits==
Attending a semester school can:
*Intensify a student’s interest in and motivation for learning.&lt;ref name="NYTAmy"&gt; [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/education/edlife/farmm.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2 New York Times - Semester Away]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

'''The Association for Science Education''' ('''ASE''') is a professional [[Professional association|association]] in the [[United Kingdom]] for teachers of science and science technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|year=1998|title=The Nature of Science in Science Education: An Introduction|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008642510402#page-1|journal=Science &amp; Education|volume=7|pages=511–532|doi=10.1023/A:1008642510402|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The association was formed in 1963 and is a member of the UK [[Science Council]].

== Aims ==
The Royal Charter of the Association for Science Education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ase.org.uk/about-ase/royal-charter/|title=Royal Charter - The Association for Science Education|website=www.ase.org.uk|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; States,

"The objects and purposes for which The Association is hereby constituted are the promotion of education by the following means:

(a) by improving the teaching of science and

(b) by providing an authoritative medium through which opinions of teachers of science may be expressed on educational matters and

(c) by affording means of communication among all persons and bodies of persons concerned with the teaching of science in particular and with education in general."

==History==
The ASE formed in 1963 by the merger of the [[Science Masters Association]] and the [[Association of Women Science Teachers]]. The Association for Science Education can trace its origins back to 1900. The first Annual Meeting was held in January 1901 which then led to the formation of the Association of Public School Science Masters. Incorporated by Royal Charter in October 2004, the ASE operates as a Registered Charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=313123&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|title=Charity Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the ASE can be found in two publications: ''Interpreters of Science''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Interpreters of Science: History of the Association for Science Education|last=David|first=Layton|publisher=John Murray Publishers Ltd|year=1984|isbn=978-0719541858|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by David Layton and, published to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the association,  ''Advancing Science Education: the first fifty years of the Association for Science Education'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Science Education: the first fifty years of the Association for Science Education|last=Edgar|first=Jenkins|publisher=Association for Science Education|year=2013|isbn=9780863574351|location=United Kingdom|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edited by Edgar Jenkins and Valerie Wood-Robinson.

The Patron of the Association is [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|HRH Prince Philip]], Duke of Edinburgh, KG,PC,KT, GMBE, FRS.

==Activities==
The Association promotes improvements in science education and education in general, specifically through advice and support for teachers, technicians and others with meetings and conferences, journals and resources, curriculum and professional development programmes and contributions to research and policy debates.

The ASE is a specialist publisher for the science education market. This includes approximately 200 titles ranging from Primary to Secondary and Post 16 science education.

===Journals===
The ASE produces four journals which not only keep members up to date with developments in science education but also provide ideas and tips for the delivery of science education. Their journals include:
*Education in Science - the in house journal keeping members up to date with ASE developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ase.org.uk/journals/education-in-science/|title=Education in Science - The Association for Science Education|website=www.ase.org.uk|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Primary Science ''(previously: Primary Science Review)'' - aimed at the primary sector, giving ideas for lessons and developments in primary science education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ase.org.uk/journals/primary-science/&lt;/ref&gt;
*School Science Review - aimed at the secondary sector, giving ideas for lessons and developments in primary science education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ase.org.uk/journals/school-science-review/|title=School Science Review - The Association for Science Education|website=www.ase.org.uk|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Science Teacher Education - aimed at providers of initial teacher training and aims to inform and contribute to the development of science teacher education in all phases of education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ase.org.uk/journals/science-teacher-education/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annual Conference ===
The annual conference attracts over 3000 delegates and include 350+ talks and workshops ranging from academic lectures and exhibitions, to a social programme and themed days.

== Governance ==
An elected '''Education Group''' governs and controls the affairs of the Association. The Education Group advises the Trustees on all aspects of science education. Its 30 members represent all sectors of the science education community and speaks authoritatively on behalf of the Association. The group is led by the Chair of the Association and meets 3 times a year.  The Chair of the Association is elected by the membership and serves a term of one year.

'''The Trustee Body''' has responsibility for ensuring that ASE works properly as a charity, that the finances are properly regulated and monitored and the appropriate policies are in place. The trustees meets 3 times a year and consists of 11 member trustees.

==In Bangalore==
Arriving in Bangalore from Calcutta, Thomas Hodson and his wife, temporarily lived at the Wesleyan Mission House at the [[Bangalore Cantonment]], along with Rev. Hardy. His initial days was spent learning Kannada and Tamil. In particular, Hodson intended to follow the example of the American missionaries in [[Ceylon]] and establish an extensive educational system in Bangalore.

According to Captain Woodward of the 32 NI, reporting on 4 November 1832, the Wesleyan Mission was established in the [[Bangalore Cantonment]] in 1819. The contact till then was restricted to the Tamil population of the Cantonment and the English soldiers. A Wesleyan Chapel had been established in the Bangalore Cantonment (the present Wesley Tamil Church, Haines Road), and services were conducted regularly in Tamil and 1 service every Sunday for the English soldiers. Contact with the Canarese population of the [[Bengaluru Pete|Bangalore Pettah]] was restricted. For reaching out to the Canarese, Thomas Hodson was learning the language, so he would be able to interact with them.&lt;ref name="CalcuttaObserver1834"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hodson|first1=Thomas|title=Methodist Mission, Madras|journal=The Calcutta Christian Observer|date=January 1834|volume=3|issue=1|pages=50–51|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=3LYOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=mrs+little+wesleyan+school+bangalore&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fuKAPwtzUZ&amp;sig=U-NjAf9B4GdZplWNFyTK0jgwkEk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ2ZuDn43MAhWF2KYKHQh5Av4Q6AEIODAH#v=onepage&amp;q=mrs%20little%20wesleyan%20school%20bangalore&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832, Hodson was appointed to Bangalore, along with Peter Percival. Wesleyan missionaries were supposed to take up the dual task of educating and preaching to the locals. Around this time, Hodson decided to start a Mission at [[Gubbi]], which a native town in the [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore Kingdom]]. The reason for Hodson choosing Gubbi to set up the mission was that, in Bangalore he found that his time and efforts were taken away in preaching to the British and European officers, and he could not concentrate on the local population. However, the Gubbi mission was temporarily abandoned and Hodson returned to Bangalore. In 1834, Hodson purchased about 20 acres of land, just outside the [[Bengaluru Pete|Bangalore Petah]] (the current [[United Mission School]] and College, Unity Buildings, etc.). In the same year, Hodson had to take up the role of Supervisor of the Wesleyan Tamil Mission. During his tenure, he started an Anglo-Tamil school in the [[Bangalore Cantonment|Bangalore Civil and Military Station]]. The reputation of the school spread, and several respected Hindu gentlemen of the Petah, requested Hodson to open a Canarese School in the Petah. Hence, a room was rented within the Fort walls and Canarese (Kannada) school was started. In this room, Hodson preached his first sermon in Canarese in 1835.

For some time, Hodson was involved in managing the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] works at Bangalore. After some time he moved back to [[Gubbi|Goobie]], living out in a tent. Rev. Thomas Cryer took over from Hodson as the Supervisor of the Wesleyan Tamil Mission. At this time [[William Arthur (minister)|William Arthur]] (an Irishman, after whom the [[William Arthur Memorial Church, Gubbi|William Arthur Memorial]] [http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xIn7fk6E6RE/UI5BUmvFQoI/AAAAAAAADLs/It8pDKDZmw4/s1600/church+gub.JPG Church] at [[Gubbi|Goobie]] is named after) and Peter Batchelor, laymen who came to Madras to run the Church Ministry Service (CMS) Press joined the Wesleyan Mission, and were transferred to the Weslyan Tamil Mission at [[Bangalore Cantonment]]. Arthur them moved to Gubbi as the Wesleyan missionary.&lt;ref name=Pritchard&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pritchard|first1=John|title=Methodists and their Missionary Societies 1760-1900|date=28 Sep 2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=OgaiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT114&amp;lpg=PT114&amp;dq=thomas+hodson+missionary+bangalore&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bv9OMK26us&amp;sig=NJ_kl5ZZ_QT1e5mH1SFocv_ekr8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiw9NqOpp7JAhUBeaYKHRTmB4sQ6AEIMDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20hodson%20missionary%20bangalore&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Hodson recorded the experiences of the Gubbi Mission in his book ''Old Daniel, or, Memoir of a converted Hindoo: with observations on mission work in the Goobbe circuit and description of village life in India'', which provides an excellent account of village life in the 19th century Mysore State.&lt;ref name=OldDaniel /&gt;&lt;ref name=Findlay&gt;{{cite book|last1=Findlay|first1=George Gillanders|last2=Holdsworth|first2=William West|title=The history of the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society: Volume 5|date=1921|publisher=The Epworth Press|location=London|pages=206-107|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofwesleya05find|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wesleyan Canarese Mission==
According to [[William Arthur (minister)|William Arthur]], the Wesleyan Canarese Mission was located in the [[Bengaluru Pete|Bangalore Petah]], at about 3 miles from the Wesleyan Tamil Mission house. The land for the Wesleyan Canarese Mission was obtained by Thomas Hodson, and was located just outside one of the town gates. Initially, it was a school with a school room which served as the residence of the school master. The school provided English education and considerable number of students were enrolled. Thereafter Mr. Webber was sent to this mission. In 1840, Garrett and Jenkins were appointed as Wesleyan Canarese missionaries, with an authority to build a printing press and a mission-house. Thus was established the Wesleyan Mission Press, with the funding coming from English gentry. The missionaries started to preach in the streets of the petah in the early hours of the day. The sermon was simple Christian concepts such as unity of God, atonement of Christ, etc.&lt;ref name=Arthur&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arthur|first1=William|title=A Mission To The Mysore With Scenes And Facts Illustrative Of India, Its People And Its Religion|date=1850|publisher=Partridge and Oakey|location=London|pages=163–164|url=https://archive.org/details/missiontomysorw00arth|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thomas Hodson's Account of the Bangalore Petah, 1856==
Thomas Hodson in 1856, describes Bangalore as consisting of two parts - the [[Bangalore Cantonment|Cantonment]] where the soldiers lived and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] was primarily spoken, and the Old Town or the native town ([[Bengaluru Pete|Bangalore Pete]]) where [[Canarese|Kannada]] was the main language. In both parts a total of 130,000 Indians lived.&lt;ref name=Offering1857&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hodson|first1=Thomas|title=Bangalore: Wesleyan Wayside Preaching-Place|journal=Wesleyan Juvenile Offering|date=July 1857|volume=XIV|pages=72–74|url=https://archive.org/details/wesleyanjuvenil12socigoog|accessdate=11 November 2015|publisher=Wesleyan Mission-House|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further he describes the shops of the Bangalore petah, with mud being used for the walls and the floor, wooden pillars and clay used for flat roofs. There were no windows or any protection from the dust, with a mat from the rooftop for shade. At night, the shops were secured by wooden shutters. The shop-keeper sat on the floor of the shop, or on one of the lower shelves. The traders were cloth merchants, grocers, gold smiths, etc. The shops sold sugarcane, coconut, bananas, rice, sweets which were hung on a string and various grains which were kept in baskets with were smeared with cow-dung. Water carriers carrying water was a common site. There were thousands of moneys which created mischief, but were unharmed by the natives due to their religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=Offering1856&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hodson|first1=Richard G|title=A Bazar, or Shop, in One of the Principal Streets of Bangalore|journal=Wesleyan Juvenile Offering|date=September 1856|volume=XIII|url=https://archive.org/details/wesleyanjuvenil18socigoog|accessdate=10 November 2015|publisher=Wesleyan Mission House|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sketches==
Thomas Hodson made several sketches about the life in the [[Bengaluru Pete|Bangalore Petah]] and the [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore State]]. Many of these were published as engravings in the 'Wesleyan Juvenile Offering'. The original colour sketches are in museums and in private collections. Some of Hodson's sketches are with the [[Museum of Sydney]], The Rocks.

[[File:Place de Fontenoy, UNESCO székház (Breuer Marcell). Fortepan 87545.jpg|thumb|Travertine sculpture in front of the [[World Heritage Centre]] in Paris in 1971]]

'''''UNESCO Reclining Figure 1957–58''''' is a sculpture by [[Henry Moore]]. It was made in a series of scales, from a small plaster [[maquette]], through a half-size working model made in plaster and cast in bronze (LH 415), to a full-size version carved in Roman [[travertine]] marble in 1957–1958 (LH 416). The final work was installed in 1958 at the [[World Heritage Centre]], the headquarters of [[UNESCO]] (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) at the [[Place de Fontenoy]] in Paris. This was Moore's last major public commission in which he created a new work for a specific site; he afterwards generally worked from an existing sketch or model.

==Background==
Moore was commissioned in 1955 to create a sculpture for the piazza in front of UNESCO's new headquarters in Paris, designed by the architect [[Marcel Breuer]]. Early ideas included groups of standing or seated figures, such as ''[[Draped Reclining Woman 1957–58]]'' and ''[[Draped Seated Woman 1957–58]]'', but he settled on a single and more abstract reclining figure for the UNESCO commission.  Some of his early drawings are held by the [[British Museum]].   

==Description==
Moore took several maquettes to Paris in February 1957 for UNESCO representatives to select the best one. The selected sculpture depicts the abstracted form of a reclining female human figure, with recognisable arms, torso, and legs, and a disproportionately small head, with hollows representing eyes.  Parallels can be drawn with his early stone ''[[Reclining Figure 1929]]'' and his elmwood ''[[Reclining Figure 1935–6]]''.  Moore made the suggestion that the final work should be carved in white stone, to contrast with the dark windows of the building behind, rather than casting it in bronze as originally intended.

==Working model==
[[File:Moore Große liegende Frauenfigur 1957 Zürich.jpg|thumb|Bronze working model in Zurich in 2010]]

Moore completed a half-size working plaster model in August 1957, which measures {{convert|235|cm}}.  This model was made by applying layers of plaster to an armature, the surface of which was then worked with chisels and other tools.  

The plaster working model is held by the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]].  The working model (LH 415) was cast in bronze in edition of 7 (5 plus and artists copy, plus one extra cast made for the Tate Gallery), in 1959–1961: three at the [[Corinthian Art Bronze Foundry]] in London, two at {{ill|Fonderie Susse|fr}} in Paris, and two at the [[Hermann Noack]] foundry in Berlin.  One example of the {{convert|730|kg}} bronze is held by the Tate Gallery (cast 2/5).  Other examples are held in the collections of the [[Carnegie Museum of Art]] in Pittsburgh, the [[Chicago Art Institute]], the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in Amsterdam (cast 4/5), and the [[Kunsthaus Zürich]] (cast 5/5).

==Full-size sculpture==
The completed plaster working model was sent to the Société S. Henraux quarry at {{ill|Querceta|it}}, near [[Seravezza]] and close to [[Carrara]] in northern Italy, in September 1957, where it was copied as a full-size version using four large blocks of Roman travertine marble.  Moore visited frequently to check on how the work was progressing, and to finish parts roughed out by the Italian workmen.  He took his wife Irina and daughter Mary on one trip, and instituted a tradition of taking regular summer holidays in the area, later buying his own cottage.  

The final sculpture (LH 416) was finished in mid-1958, over {{convert|16|ft}} long and {{convert|8|ft}} high, and weighing 38 tons, making it one of Moore's largest sculptures.  It was installed near the new Y-shaped UNESCO building at the [[Place de Fontenoy]] in Paris in October 1958, and it was in place when the building was inaugurated the following month.  The sculpture was moved in 1965, when UNESCO extended its offices, and it is now sited near Building IV.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2900">'''Ubiquitous robot''' is a term used in an analogous way to [[ubiquitous computing]].  Software useful for "integrating robotic technologies with technologies from the fields of ubiquitous and pervasive computing, [[sensor network]]s, and [[ambient intelligence]]".

The emergence of mobile phone, [[wearable computer]]s and ubiquitous computing makes it likely that human beings will live in a ubiquitous world in which all devices are fully networked. The existence of ubiquitous space resulting from developments in computer and network technology will provide motivations to offer desired services by any IT device at any place and time through user interactions and seamless applications. This shift has hastened the ubiquitous revolution, which has further manifested itself in the new multidisciplinary research area, ubiquitous robotics. It initiates the third generation of [[robotics]] following the first generation of the [[industrial robot]] and the second generation of the [[personal robot]].

Ubiquitous robot (Ubibot) is a robot incorporating three components including virtual software [[robot]] or [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]], real-world mobile robot and embedded sensor system in surroundings. Software robot within a [[virtual world]] can control a real-world robot as a brain and interact with human beings. Researchers of [[KAIST, Korea]] describe these three components as a Sobot ([[Intelligent agent|Software robot]]), Mobot ([[Mobile robot]]), and Embot ([[Embedded robot]]).
