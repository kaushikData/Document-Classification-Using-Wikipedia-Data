      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64758">'''Adolescent cliques''' are [[clique]]s that develop amongst [[adolescence|adolescents]]. In the social sciences, the word "'''clique'''" is used to describe a group of 2 to 12 (averaging 5 or 6) "who interact with each other more regularly and intensely than others in the same setting".&lt;ref name=EEP&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Salkind | first = Neil | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of educational psychology | title = Cliques | date = 2008-01-01 | publisher = Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cliques are distinguished from "[[Crowds (adolescence)|crowds]]" in that their members interact with one another (e.g. hang out together, go shopping, play basketball).  Crowds, on the other hand, are defined by reputation.  Although the word 'clique' or 'cliquey' is often used in day-to-day conversation to describe [[relational aggression]] or snarky, gossipy behaviors of groups of socially dominant teenage girls, that is not scientifically accurate.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Interacting with cliques is part of normative social development regardless of gender, ethnicity, or popularity. Although cliques are most commonly studied during [[adolescence]] and middle childhood, they exist in all age groups.

==Definition==
As children enter [[adolescence]], cultural, biological and cognitive changes cause variation in their daily lives. Adolescents spend far less time with their parents and begin participating in both structured and unstructured peer activities.&lt;ref name=TextBook&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Steinberg | authorlink = Laurence Steinberg | first1 = Laurence D. | title = Adolescence | edition = 9 | publisher = McGraw-Hil | year = 2010 | location = New York, New York | isbn = 978-0-07-353203-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.151}} Without the direct presence of their parents or other adults, their peer network begins to become the primary context for most socialization and activity.  These social "cliques" fundamentally influence adolescent life and development.&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;{{rp|p.155–164}}&lt;ref name=Brown93&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = B.

Although cliques can range from two to twelve people, cliques typically consist of five or six people who are homogeneous in age, gender, race, social status, and socioeconomic background.&lt;ref name=EEP/&gt;&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt; More subtle determinant of group membership, such as shared interests and values, take precedence as adolescents develop more sophisticated, abstract cognitive functions (more [[Adolescence#Cognitive development|here]]), which allow them to categorize individuals in more subtle ways and better interpret social interactions.&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;{{rp|p.156}}  Consistent group identities thus allow individuals to cope with the anonymity and intimidation that often accompany the transition into large secondary schools.&lt;ref name=EEP/&gt;&lt;ref name=glass&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = B. B.| last2 = Bank | first2 = H.| last3 = Steinberg | first3 = L.| doi = 10.1007/s10964-007-9198-y | title = Smoke in the Looking Glass: Effects of Discordance Between Self- and Peer Rated Crowd Affiliation on Adolescent Anxiety, Depression and Self-feelings| url = http://journals.ohiolink.edu/ejc/article.cgi?issn=00472891&amp;issue=v37i0010&amp;article=1163_sitlgeoaadas| journal = [[Journal of Youth and Adolescence]]| issn = 0047-2891| volume = 37 | issue = 10 | pages = 1163–1177| date=November 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar cliques may re-emerge in adulthood in specific contexts, characterized by large, undifferentiated, anonymous crowds. Overall, cliques are a transitory social phase.&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;&lt;ref name=Negriff&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Negriff | first1 = S.| last2 = Susman | first2 = E.

J. | last3 = Cillessen | first3 = A. H. N. | title = Is Being Popular a Risky Proposition? | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2008.00550.x | journal = [[Journal of Research on Adolescence]]| issn = 1532-7795 | volume = 18 | pages = 49–74| date=March 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During late adolescence, the organized clique structure typically dissolves into associated sets of couples, which then remain the primary social unit into and throughout adulthood.&lt;ref name=EEP/&gt;

Cliques are different from other types of peer groups often seen in the average school, which are often reputation-based groups such as jocks or nerds. The major difference is that these reputation-based groups do not necessarily interact with each other, whereas members of a clique do interact with one another and have frequent social interactions.&lt;ref name=bob /&gt; For example, football players are considered jocks, but not all members of a football team always interact with each other.

==Clique membership==

===Common misconceptions===

Although the [[Popular culture|popular media]] portrays female cliques almost exclusively (see examples in [[Heathers|movies]], [[10 Things I Hate About You (TV series)|television]], and [[The Clique (series)|young adult fiction]]), clique membership is almost equally prevalent in adolescent boys. Girls do, however, tend to form cliques earlier (11 years old as compared with 13 or 14 among boys), which may contribute to the greater popular salience of female cliques.&lt;ref name=EEP/&gt; Additionally, the activities central to most female cliques include gossip and emotional sharing; this behavior visibly increases, revealing female cliques to the outside observer. Male cliques, on the other hand, tend to center around activities that have occurred before the formation of the clique (common examples include basketball and video games), and thus may draw less attention to the appearance of male cliques. Male cliques may have also gone largely unnoticed because they often appear less exclusive toward the non-clique peer group members.&lt;ref name=EEP/&gt; This last difference may arise because males more frequently reported ambitions related to acceptance and status throughout their [[Crowds (adolescence)|crowd]], whereas females more often aspired to status and close bonds with only a few peers (i.e. a clique).&lt;ref name=EEP/&gt;&lt;ref name=contagion&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = G. L. | last2 = Prinstein | first2 = M. J. | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2006.00913.x | title = Peer Contagion of Aggression and Health Risk Behavior Among Adolescent Males: An Experimental Investigation of Effects on Public Conduct and Private Attitudes | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]]| issn = 1467-8624| volume = 77 | issue = 4 | pages = 967–983 | date=July–August 2006 | pmid =  16942500| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Males were also more likely to consider actively exclusive behavior unethical, as were younger adolescents.&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;{{rp|p.161}} The stereotype of cruel, unwelcoming clique members is well supported in some cases, but other cliques are more open to drifters. Both attitudes appear in some cliques of both sexes and all social groups become more permeable with age.&lt;ref name=QBs&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Wiseman | first1 = Rosalind | title = Queen bees &amp; wannabes : helping your daughter survive cliques, gossip, boyfriends, and other realities of adolescence | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-1-4000-4792-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, although adolescents tend to associate with others of the same ethnicity and socioeconomic status, clique membership is equally common across ethnicity and economic background. The characteristics of the distinct cliques within each demographic group also vary equally, although members of cliques in one crowd or demographic group may not perceive all of the distinctions in others (see also [[Crowds (adolescence)|crowds]]).&lt;ref name=Birds&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hamm | first1 = J. V. | title = Do birds of a feather flock together? The variable bases for African American, Asian American, and European American adolescents' selection of similar friends| url = http://journals.ohiolink.edu/ejc/article.cgi?issn=00121649&amp;issue=v36i0002&amp;article=209_dboaffaasosf| doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.36.2.209 | journal = [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]]| issn = 0012-1649 | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 209–219 | date=March 2000 | pmid =  10749078| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forms of association===

A number of recent studies confirm that regardless of gender, ethnicity, or [[socioeconomic status]], adolescents tend to fall into one of three categories: group members, liaisons, and isolates.&lt;ref name=EEP/&gt;&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;{{rp|p.158}}
# '''Group Member''': The majority of group members' social interactions occur within the same small group. They comprise less than half of any given school population at a time, with a higher concentration among girls and younger grades.
# '''Liaisons''': Liaisons associate with a few members of multiple cliques and are generally regarded positively by their peers.
# '''Isolates''': Characterized by few, if any, close peer relationships, these individuals do not regularly interact with any clique members. Isolated can be further classified by social agency:
## '''Volunteer status''' – these isolates deliberately avoid forming relationships.
## '''Forced status''' – peers actively exclude, mock, or victimize these isolates (see [[relational aggression]] and [[bullying]]).

===Stability over time===

Membership type is far more stable over time than membership in an individual clique: isolates generally remain socially disengaged, liaisons remain equally consistent, and "group members" frequently switch from one clique to another, but typically remain group members over time.&lt;ref name=change&gt;{{cite journal | title = Adolescent friendship networks: continuity and change over the school year | journal = Merrill-Palmer Quarterly | year = 1998 | first = Serdar M. | last = Degirmencioglu |author2=Kathryn A. Urberg|author3=Jerry M. Tolson | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–337 | url = http://vnweb.hwwilsonweb.com/hww/jumpstart.jhtml?recid=0bc05f7a67b1790e1fe629758238eb96705f3df23a139b18d9cdd066a2c4270392ffc07fbb421713&amp;fmt=H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective cliques themselves remain surprisingly stable as well.  On average, cliques lose around one third of their members over a given school year, but new members with similar characteristics tend to replace the deserters, maintaining the general identity of the clique.&lt;ref name=change/&gt;  Clique membership becomes more stable across time, as well as more permeable, less exclusive, and less hierarchical.&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;{{rp|p.161}} Contrary to popular belief, individual friendships are far less stable across the school year.&lt;ref name=change/&gt;  This is particularly true of high-status cliques and individuals, in which clique members must critically analyze their friendships and socialize only with their most popular peers or risk losing membership and status.&lt;ref name=QBs/&gt;

==Types of American cliques==

Using the definition of a clique, we are able to draw distinctions between the many different types of cliques a person is able to be a member of. During adolescent years, students may obtain membership to a certain clique in order to ease the process of secondary school. Since adolescents emulating similar cultural standards are likely to become friends and these friends are likely to encourage these aspects of their attitudes, behaviors, and dress,&lt;ref name=math&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = K. A.| last2 = Muller | first2 = C.| last3 = Schiller | first3 = K. S.| last4 = Riegle‐Crumb | first4 = C.| last5 = Mueller | first5 = A. S.| last6 = Crosnoe | first6 = R.| last7 = Pearson | first7 = J.| doi = 10.1086/587153 | title = The Social Dynamics of Mathematics Coursetaking in High School| url = &lt;!-- http://freedownload.is/pdf/the-social-dynamics-of-mathematics-coursetaking-in-high-school-26623462.html -- not sure of copyright status --&gt;| journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 113 | issue = 6 | pages = 1645–1696| date=May 2008 | pmid =  21031147| pmc = 2963869}}&lt;/ref&gt; the types of cliques commonly found in schools can vary significantly. Some of the more common types of cliques found include: jocks, tomboys, cheerleaders, mean girls, foreigners, gamers, hipsters, hippies, troublemakers, peacemakers, class clowns, "cool kids", arty intellectuals, gangsters, wangsters, "ghetto kids", stoners/slackers, girly girls, scenesters, scene kids, punks, preps, skaters, goths, emos, skinheads, geeks/nerds, and drifters.

===Middle school cliques===
Sociologists Patricia and Peter Adler claim that Middle School cliques can fall under four specific labels:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://life.familyeducation.com/peer-pressure/self-esteem/36541.html |title=Cliques and Fitting In| accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''The Popular Clique''' – members of this clique are generally known to have the most friends in their school, and are viewed as having the most fun.
*'''The Fringe Group''' – members of this clique follow in the shadow of members of the popular clique—they mimic the popular cliques' actions, structure and guidelines, but are not actually part of it. They are "second in line" to the popular kids. 
*'''The Friendship Circles''' – members of friendship circles tend to be groups of friends who share a common belief, interest, style, appearance, or hobby, or are looking for their own culture separate from the other cliques.
*'''The Loners''' – members of this group seem to have very few friends, and prefer to work and be alone. Some may be envious of those who belong to a different clique.

The friendship circles can be divided into some categories, such as...
*'''The Athletic Group''' - members of this group play sports in or outside of school. They tend to have many friends and are sometimes with the popular clique. These kids are usually in a regular [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]. 
*'''The Nerds/Geeks'''- members of this group are studious, and care a lot about their schoolwork. Some may be socially impaired, however most have friends in the same group. They prefer video games, studying, and reading instead of playing sports or going to large social events.
*'''The Punks/Emos''' – members of punk or emo cliques tend to have small amounts of friends and trouble interacting with others, they can be seen as violent or depressed due to their heavy use of makeup and dark clothing. This clique is less common in middle schools than it may be in high schools.

===High school cliques===

[[TLC (TV channel)]] mentions and describes some typical types of teen cliques observable in most high schools.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J. (2012, March 8). Some of the more common types of cliques found include: jocks, cheerleaders, mean girls, foreigners, gamers, sluts, hipsters, hippies, arty intellectuals, gangsters, stoners/slackers, scenesters, punks, preps, skaters, goths, emos, skinheads, geeks/nerds, athletic girls, "cool kids" and drifters. [http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/family/10-types-of-teens.htm 10 Types of Teens: A Field Guide to Teenagers]. ''TLC Family''. Retrieved October 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Geek]]s''' – a group of students described as being intellectual, obsessive or socially impaired. They usually don't have the modern fashion sense of other groups, and they usually prefer chess to hoops. "Geeky" interests and hobbies usually include: fantasy movies and shows, role-playing games and technical hobbies and activities (which in some cases can include technology knowledge). Geeks are smart, but they sometimes have a hard time socially, as many teens view them as being more boring to be around than others.
*'''[[Jock (athlete)|Jocks]]''' – live for athletics, tend to be popular with many of their peers. They may be the male equivalent of "mean girls".
*'''Thespians''' – the teens who are obsessed with Broadway musicals and more than likely aspire to do theatre professionally. They typically have a very busy and complicated schedule, spending most of their time in rehearsal for the school show or working on their craft. They generally do well academically and have a good sense of responsibility. Their hobbies include learning all the songs and dances to all their favourite musicals, singing randomly at any given time, and obsessing over a new favourite Broadway show every week. They are usually very kind and sweet to those outside of their own clique, except for the occasional diva. They are also creative and very funny, but have a unique sense of humor which is only funny to those who understand musical theatre references; their preferred subjects are in the performing arts—drama, singing, dance, acting, and musical theatre. They may also be involved in other performing arts activities, such as choir or dancing.
*'''[[Skater subculture|Skaters]]''' – skateboarders who came along and borrowed the long hair and slacker trappings of the surf scene, but they have always been more rebellious.
*'''Outsiders''' – may be socially challenged and unable to fit in, or they may be independent and feel no need to join any one group exclusively. They tend to have an "I don't care about anything" attitude, and will oftentimes get in trouble for it.
*'''[[Indie kid|Hipsters]]''' – make a big effort to assemble a wardrobe that seems effortless. They challenge traditional norms and modern trends. All genders wear tight jeans, flannel shirts, [[Buddy Holly]] glasses and vintage clothing. They follow the latest trends in fashion and like to be independent from the other cliques and often do what is "uncool" before it becomes "cool".
*[[Greaser (subculture)|Greasers]] - A rather uncommon clique but can be spotted in high schools all over the globe. This clique started in the late 40s and was popular up until the mid 60s but there are small cliques you can find who are greasers. Hated by lots of kids and are teased but tease back (Give none take none is a motto by the greasers meaning; don't take crap or create crap). Greasers wear leather jackets, dickies jackets, etc. and jeans cuffed 1-3 inches and grease their hair using pomade or a similar substance. They also can be spotted wearing vintage looking converse and "buckle boots" otherwise known as engineer boots.
*'''Scenesters''' – Also known as [[Trendies]], they are ever eager to fit in. They are dedicated followers of fashion, devoted to a particular band, club or style. They dress in tight, fashionable clothing, wear sunglasses and sport wild but styled hairdos (striped, streaked or spiked). Social media platforms are totally essential to them. Scenesters sometimes get labelled posers or wannabes.
*'''[[Preppy|Preps]]''' – a subgenre of the [[Airhead (subculture)|popular clique]]. Preps tend to be good at being social and having fun and usually come from an upper middle class or upper-class family. Sometimes they overlap with jocks, especially when it comes to sports. In most high schools, preps are those most commonly chosen to have important positions for school events such as Class Officers, Home Coming King/Queen, Prom King/Queen and Prom Court. Maintaining the right image may even make them vulnerable. Unlike the stereotype of "mean girls", preps often get along with everyone.
*'''[[Nerd]]s''' – they are obsessed and often have superior knowledge or devotion to something, usually aren't fashion-conscious, may be introverted, and they often do well in school.  
*'''[[Mean Girls (real life)|Mean girls]]''' – the 2004 movie ''[[Mean Girls]]'', starring [[Lindsay Lohan]] as a girl negotiating the jungles of teenage subcultures, put a new label on this type of teen. They always embrace the latest fashions. They form exclusive cliques and frequently engage in gossip. They crave popularity, often because they feel insecure; yet they have a hard time with genuine relationships.
*'''[[Emo kid]]s''' – highly emotional. Their emotions are reflected in their appearance: dark clothing, streaked bangs, and tattoos and piercings. The [[emo]] style has its roots in punk culture, which tended to be more rebellious, and goth, which was darker and gloomier. Some emos are described as scene kids because they wear brighter neon clothes. These kids are more vulnerable to depression or bipolar tendencies. They are known for experiments with self-injury and cutting, though not all of them do this. Emo kids tend to be mistaken for goth due to their dark outfits, or sometimes rockers being they often wear band t-shirts and have a lot of musical interests.
*'''[[Greaser (subculture)|Rockers]]''' – tend to stay away from the crowd and in small groups with similar interests in music. This is a very large clique because of how diverse it is. They tend to wear band T-shirts, lots of jewelry, and baggy or tight jeans and are usually listening to music. Many of them will be in a band or know an instrument. They live according to the Rock and Roll lifestyle: Sex, drugs, and music.
*'''Drifters''' – individuals that are capable of simultaneous interactions with one or more groups non-exclusively, or being independent at their own accord. They don't demand attention, often opting to blend in the background to avoid potential conflict or being labeled as part of a group. However, some usually don't mind being in the know with most gossips or rumors or learning things that no one else is aware of. All-Rounders play the neutral role most of the time. In some cases they act as a liaison between two different groups. As such, they are considered to be "well-known" rather than being "popular".

==Within clique structure==

===Popularity===
A powerful, yet unstable social hierarchy structures interactions between group members in any given clique. This hierarchy is always topped by the highest-status member, labeled by psychologists as the "Leader" or "Queen Bee".&lt;ref name=EEP/&gt;&lt;ref name=QBs/&gt;  In her now famous ethnography of adolescent cliques, ''[[Queen Bees and Wannabes]]'', author Rosalind Wiseman explains the standard set of roles most frequently adopted by male and female clique members.

''Females:''

* '''Queen Bee''' – Leader: rules by "charisma, force, money, looks, will, &amp; manipulation".
* '''Sidekick''' – Lieutenant: invariably supports the ''Queen Bee''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s opinions.
* '''Banker''' – Gossip: collects and employs information for her own gain until part of clique, then works for benefit of ''Queen Bee'' and ''Sidekick''.
* '''Floater''' – Similar to a Liaison; closely associated with multiple cliques.
* '''Pleaser''' – Can be in or out of clique: immediately adopts all of the ''Queen Bee'' and ''Sidekick''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s opinions, yet never gains their approval and is often treated with indifference by the Queen Bee.
* '''Target''' – Outside of the clique; regularly excluded and humiliated.

''Males:''

* '''Leader''' – Like the ''Queen Bee'' except well-respected: Athletic, tough, rich, &amp; gets the girls.
* '''Flunkie''' – Like the ''Pleaser'', he does anything asked of him, but he also responds to any member. Inadvertently annoys others with his actions regularly.
* '''Thug''' – Although often smarter than he lets on, the ''Thug'' communicates primarily through nonverbal bullying.  He typically appears popular, but may have had a rough past or childhood.
* '''The Get Wits''' – Groupies of male clique: respected by adults as high-achieving "good kids", but only unsought tag-a-longs to the clique.

Although too rigid to be entirely accurate across samples, these basic denominations are useful for discussing general behavior and organization within cliques. The role hierarchies within cliques are significantly more stable than the individual members. Maintaining one's status and power requires constant effort. ''Queen Bees'' and ''Leaders'' must work the hardest to protect their positions and typically become [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and disliked in the process.&lt;ref name=risk/&gt;&lt;ref name=QBs/&gt;&lt;ref name=change/&gt; For example, a ''Leader'' or ''Queen Bee'' may keep objective attention off of him or herself by unpredictably alternating praise and criticism of other members (see [[relational aggression]]). They may also change the way the clique views activities, values, and opinions of things to keep the other members unsure of where they stand in the group."&lt;ref name=EEP/&gt;&lt;ref name=QBs/&gt;

The ''Leader'' or ''Queen Bee'' also maintains power over group membership—exercised through both tacit and explicit rejection of prospective members—as well as the final say in accepting new members, regardless of the opinions of other members.&lt;ref name=change/&gt; The majority of new memberships results from one of two approaches: invitation or application. The "invitation" approach originates within the clique: a current member of a clique invites a potential member either explicitly or by indirect socialization, which consists of the clique attempting to demonstrate the joys and benefits of membership. Aspiring peers who have not been invited can also "apply" by courting the lowest ranking members and progressing up to the ''Leader'' or ''Queen Bee'' who will decide whether to accept him or her.&lt;ref name=EEP/&gt;&lt;ref name=QBs/&gt;

===Elements of popularity===

Advanced and adaptable social skills are the best predictors of popularity, but further predictors of popularity are difficult to identify, primarily because the schema of "[[popularity]]" represents the interaction between two distinct concepts. Popularity breaks down into [[sociometric status]] (sometimes called "likability"), which measures peers' private feelings toward the individual, and perceived popularity, which reflects the individual's status, prestige, and power.&lt;ref name=EEP/&gt;

Socio-metric status is determined by fairly universally valuable characteristics including social skills, friendliness, and sense of humor. The foundations of perceived popularity, on the other hand, vary widely.&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;{{rp|p.171}} Some popular adolescents are high in both characteristics, but they more often develop in distinct individuals and cliques, all considered "popular" during adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bruyn | first1 = E. H. | last2 = Cillessen | first2 = A. H.

Regardless of popularity type, highly popular individuals influence local norms and behaviors in similar ways: "adolescents are easily swayed by the opinions of high-status peers to endorse activities they might otherwise reject and to run the other way from activities endorsed by low-status peers, even if they secretly enjoy them".&lt;ref name=contagion/&gt; The popular individuals themselves, however, fare differently depending on the root of their status.&lt;ref name=risk/&gt; Several recent studies proved the discriminant validity of the two groups and found that perceived popularity in high school is predictive of alcohol use, sexual activity, and smoking.&lt;ref name=EEP/&gt; It may also be associated with a lasting drop in sociometric status. Several recent studies suggest that long-term outcomes are generally more positive for individuals who were neither Isolates nor among the most popular during adolescence.&lt;ref name=EEP/&gt;&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;&lt;ref name=risk/&gt;

==Between clique structure==

===Personal factors===

A status hierarchy much like that within individual cliques organizes the various cliques within each peer [[Crowds (adolescence)|crowd]].&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;{{rp|p.157}} The crowds within a given school are also perceived hierarchically. Crowd ranking can sometimes change but is generally quite stable across time and schools.&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;{{rp|p.162}} Part of a clique's popularity status is based on the crowd with which its members associate, thus similarly-popular cliques within the same crowd are more likely to move within the hierarchy than are similar crowds within the larger peer context.&lt;ref name=EEP/&gt;

Both because students meet and seek friends with others who share their interests ("selection") and because much of clique members time, both free and structured, takes place in the company of the other members ("[[socialization]]"), cliques are usually defined by common attitudes and activities.&lt;ref name=Dishion06&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dishion | first1 = Thomas J. |author2=K. A. Dodge|author3=J. E. Lansford |title = Deviant peer influences in programs for youth :problems and solutions | publisher = Guilford Press | year = 2006 | location = New York, New York | isbn =978-1-59385-279-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most powerful determinants of clique membership are orientation toward school, orientation toward [[Youth subculture|teen culture]], and involvement in [[antisocial behavior]].&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;{{rp|p.167}}

====Orientation toward school====
Because studying time and partying time conflict, most individuals are rarely exposed to individuals from the opposite end of this spectrum during unstructured time. Membership in the same clique with peers whose values are highly distinct is thus uncommon. Individuals with only somewhat different views of school, however, are likely to belong to the same clique, and socialization is likely to decrease their differences over time. For example, girls' decisions about enrollment in advanced math are significantly related to those of their close friends.&lt;ref name="math"/&gt; A study of 78 high schools found that even controlling for past achievement, the GPAs of an individual's close friends reliably help predict grades; in fact "of all the characteristics of friends that influence adolescents' behavior, their friends' school performance has the greatest impact, not only on their own academic achievement, but also on their involvement in problem behavior and drug use."&lt;ref name=GPA/&gt;

====Orientation toward teen culture====
{{See also|Youth subculture}}

Similar taste in music and clothing signal others with potentially shared interests and values and often suggest the leisure activities and substance use patterns of which they approve. Thus adolescents emulating similar cultural standards are likely to become friends and these friends are likely to encourage these aspects of their attitudes, behaviors, and dress.&lt;ref name=SE&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = B.

====Antisocial activity====
{{main|Juvenile delinquency}}
Research does not support the common belief that troubled adolescents have few or no friends.&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;{{rp|p.168}} Instead such individuals gravitate toward one another and form their own cliques, although these friendships do often differ from the friendships of more socially acceptable children.&lt;ref name=Affil/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Adams | first1 = R.

A few of the most studied are substance use, aggression, and depressive symptoms.

* '''Substance use'''
Similarity in substance use is one of the most powerful factors in clique development and lasting membership, even serving as the earliest predictor of cross-gender friendships and the most common basis for multi-ethnic cliques.&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;{{rp|p.168}} Alcohol and drug use are predicted by the interaction between number of substance using friends, the extent of their substance use, and perceived closeness to those friends;&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;{{rp|p.170}} a substance-free adolescent is thus unlikely to seek out or be accepted by a clique characterized by frequent substance use and even more unlikely to remain substance-free long after entering such clique&lt;ref name=Affil/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vitaro | first1 = F.| last2 = Brendgen | first2 = M.| last3 = Wanner | first3 = B.| title = Patterns of Affiliation with Delinquent Friends During Late Childhood and Early Adolescence: Correlates and Consequences | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9507.2005.00292.x | journal = [[Social Development (journal)|Social Development]] | issn = 1467-9507| volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 82–108| date=February 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferg&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fergusson | first1 = David M.| last2 = Vitaro | first2 = Frank| last3 = Wanner | first3 = Brigitte| last4 = Brendgen | first4 = Mara| title = Protective and compensatory factors mitigating the influence of deviant friends on delinquent behaviours during early adolescence| url = http://journals.ohiolink.edu/ejc/article.cgi?issn=01401971&amp;issue=v30i0001&amp;article=33_pacfmtodbdea| doi = 10.1016/j.adolescence.2005.05.007 | journal = [[Journal of Adolescence]]| issn = 0140-1971| volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–50 | year = 2007 | pmid =  16934323| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

** ''High Functioning'' cliques consisted of "a network of high-achieving friends who were involved in school-based extracurricular activities and who reported low use of alcohol and few symptoms of depression."
** ''Maladjusted'' cliques "showed the opposite pattern": uninvolved in school performance and organized activities, used alcohol frequently and to excess, and reported multiple symptoms of depression.
** ''Disengaged'' cliques did not encourage engagement "in much of anything, including drinking."
** ''Engaged'' cliques consisted of friends who "engaged in school, achieved decent grades, and neither abstained from nor abused alcohol."
Members of ''High Functioning'' and ''Engaged'' cliques demonstrated the best long-term outcomes, whereas ''Maladjusted'' clique membership predicted low achievement, chronic substance abuse, and confrontation with authorities and ''Disengaged'' clique members and others who abstained completely typically exhibited abnormally high anxiety and inhibition.&lt;ref name=Bryant/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shedler/&gt;

* '''Aggression'''
Gravitation toward similar peer groups can be especially dangerous for adolescents with aggressive tendencies. A recent{{when|date=November 2012}} observational study on antisocial, aggressive boys established that clique members tended to live in the same neighborhood, where they met and bonded through unstructured, unsupervised activities.&lt;ref name=Dishion95/&gt; Since antisocial groups encourage antisocial behavior, aggressive behaviors tend to escalate rapidly within groups of aggressive adolescents. In the case of [[Bullying|bullies]] this effect is so detrimental that those without any friends are actually more likely to improve over time than those with friends&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt; and generally experience better long-term outcomes.&lt;ref name=Affil/&gt;&lt;ref name=Trajec/&gt; In the most extreme cases, these groups may become [[gangs]] or practice less organized, but equally dangerous, violent delinquency&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;&lt;ref name=belong/&gt;{{rp|p.168}}

* '''Depression'''

Although these maladjusted, detrimental cliques can develop among adolescents of either gender, those based on aggression and delinquency are more often observed in males. In females, adjustment problems are more often manifested as internalizing problems, rather than the externalizing problems common among their male peers.&lt;ref name=belong/&gt; Research shows, however, that both internalizing and externalizing behaviors are negatively related to the subjective sense of strong, reliable group belonging, even controlling for adolescent age, gender, ethnicity, family structure, and parents' educational level.&lt;ref name=belong/&gt;

Because adolescent females, on average, both report stronger feelings of group belonging and place greater importance on this feeling than do their male peers,&lt;ref name=belong/&gt; girls who do not feel accepted may be more susceptible than equally excluded boys to forming and conforming to cliques based on shared maladaptive behavior. If so, differences in internalizing or externalizing behaviors of adolescent boys and girls may be magnified during adolescence, contributing to the significant gender differences observed in adult outcomes such as [[incarceration]] and [[mood disorders]].&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;{{rp|p.426}} For example, the same cycle of selection and socialization known to exacerbate aggression applies to the internalizing behaviors associated with depression.&lt;ref name=glass/&gt;&lt;ref name=dep&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Prinstein | first1 = M.

Perhaps related to the role of reassurance-seeking, those who both value and experience social acceptance are far less likely to exhibit problem behavior than those who value group membership equally, but are uncertain of their relationship.&lt;ref name=dep/&gt; This relationships is better predicted by self-esteem than the actual quality of the relationships, although also directly related to discordance in personal and peer ratings of status.&lt;ref name=glass/&gt;&lt;ref name=SE/&gt;  This effect likely arises cyclically: troubled children are rejected by their peers for their undesirable behavior, while rejected children receive less normative socialization and behave more problematically.&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;&lt;ref name=dep/&gt;{{rp|p.167–170}}

===Demographic factors===
Although there are exceptions, demographic factors typically influence [[Crowds (adolescence)|adolescent crowd]] membership even before real cliques begin to form and often influence clique membership more powerfully than personal or behavioral characteristics.  Many of the effects on clique composition described below may be largely attributed to crowd segregation.

====Age====
Because the contemporary school system divides children by age and structures the majority of most adolescents' time and social exposure, age is the most universal common factor among clique members; notable exceptions include friendships formed in neighborhoods or on the internet and those initiated with early-maturing pubertal girls, all of which are often detrimental to the younger friend.&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;&lt;ref name=Negriff/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Valkenburg | first1 = P.

====Gender====
Gender is perhaps the strongest demographic determinant of clique composition in very early puberty. During childhood and early adolescence social segregation between cliques is almost absolute. However, unlike other factors, gender division is temporary.

====Socioeconomic status====
Another, less advantageous, powerful determinant of clique formation is socioeconomic class. This trend was first published in the famous "Elmtown's Youth Study", which found that "almost never did adolescents from one social class associate with students from a class that was two ranks higher or lower".&lt;ref name=Elmtown/&gt; A diverse array of follow-up studies have confirmed that class-consciousness steadily increases throughout adolescence, so that by mid-adolescence clique membership across significantly different social backgrounds is highly anomalous.&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;{{rp|p.165}}

====Ethnicity ====
{{Main|Adolescence#Culture}}

In the United States race remains an even stronger determinant of friendship than socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=Birds/&gt; Like socioeconomic status, ethnicity is not a strong determinant of childhood friendships, but becomes increasingly potent with age. By high school, ethnically mixed cliques are rarely observed.&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;{{rp|p.165}} This pattern of social segregation is strongest between black students and all other students and most prevalent in schools where students are divided into [[tracking (education)|academic tracks]]. This is because various factors disadvantage black children, affecting performance in some cases and adult decisions in others so that in many cases black children are disproportionately likely to be placed in lower tracks, regardless of intelligence or performance&lt;ref name=track&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lucas | first1 = S.

More encouragingly, however, longitudinal observations suggest that interventions in early childhood may have the potential to influence social segregation: the more schools foster close cross-racial friendships in childhood the less peer group segregation manifests.&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;&lt;ref name=bridge/&gt;{{rp|p.167}}

====Religion====
A well-established factor in clique composition is religious background, affiliation, and participation.&lt;ref name=Elmtown/&gt; This is somewhat confounded by overlap with socioeconomic status, but also relates to behavioral correlates of religion and selection by both individual and their peers.&lt;ref name=Elmtown/&gt;

===Reputation determinants and effects===

Cliques reputation is often determined by their most noticeable behavioral characteristic that is shared among their members.&lt;ref name=bob /&gt; The characteristic might be so salient that it could dominate the way that members of that clique are perceived and treated by other peers regardless of the individual differences that each member has. For example, a clique group could be perceived as athletic, but say an individual in that group is very smart and gets good grades in school. That individual would be treated based on his athletic characteristics rather than his intellectual abilities. When people are treated based on a single characteristic it changes their self-image, resulting in a change in who they are. This phenomenon is known as the looking glass self; individuals become more like the way they think they are perceived by others. So for the example where the individual was treated based on his athletic abilities rather than his intelligence, that person will likely focus his attention more on sports rather than doing well in school, causing him or her to become even more like the clique he or she is a part of. This phenomenon where individuals in a group tend to be more like each other than non-group members is known as group homophily.&lt;ref name=bob /&gt; Children almost always choose to be friends of people who share similarities with themselves, hence why similar characteristics among clique members establish the clique's reputation and allow different cliques to be told apart.

==Clique membership and social adjustment in children's same-gender cliques==

Most people agree that children are affected by who they associate with, but what is not well understood is the specific characteristics that children of similar types of groups share. The focus of these authors' research&lt;ref name=bob&gt;Kwon, Kyongboon; Lease, A. Michele (2007). Clique membership and social adjustment in children's same-gender cliques. ''Merrill-Palmer Quarterly, 53.2'', 216-242&lt;/ref&gt; was to discover the different emotional and social effects that members of the same cliques share. For their study they divided the 473 fourth and fifth graders into five groups, which were: competent, tough, average, withdrawn, and incompetent/aggressive. The researchers did this by having students rate their classmates on several characteristics; bright, fun, bully, withdrawn, athletic, prosocial, reactive aggression. They then measured differences among groups by asking children questions regarding peers social status and behavioral characteristics. For example, they asked participants to nominate up to three participating classmates who "tries to get what he or she wants by hitting, shoving, pushing or threatening others". In addition, they asked children questions about themselves that regarded to levels of loneliness and children's social dissatisfaction.

The researcher's discovered differences in emotional well-being and social satisfaction between different types of clique groups. They found that competent and average groups showed positive characteristics such as good interpersonal skills, whereas withdrawn, incompetent/aggressive and tough cliques lacked emotional well-being and social satisfaction. Another discovery was that social status levels did not distinguish average, competent and tough cliques from one another. Therefore, if an individual is in one of these three groups they are no more likely to have a high social status than a low social status. Their conclusion to these findings was that even when taking into account individuals social status level, the type of clique people are in has a significant effect on their social and emotional characteristics.

==Change and stability in childhood==

A recent study done by Witvliet, Van Lier, Cuijpers and Koot shows the differences in behavioral characteristics between clique members and non-clique members in early elementary school, the stability of clique membership and whether the differences in these characteristics are gender oriented. Three hundred first-grade students (151 boys, 149 girls) from eleven different elementary schools in the Netherlands participated.  The children were examined by being asked to determine their best friends. This friendship was considered valid if the elected friendship was reciprocated by the other child. The child was considered to be in a clique when the following criteria was overcome 1) consisted of at least three children 2) each child had to have more connections with members than non-members and 3) a link had to occur between all members of clique. Children were then rated by their peers to determine who was liked the most versus who was liked the least. The children were also asked to determine behavioural characteristics of participants and who best fit the description of characteristics such as aggressive, anxious, etc. The peer study was followed through every spring and children were given a small reward for their involvement. These results were then used to compare between clique members and non-clique members. These results were also used to discuss the children's characteristics while also separating based on gender. In first grade, 29 cliques were found with an average of 5.3 members. In second grade 25 cliques were found with an average of 6.2 members. This study suggests that clique members tend to be more adjusted and that gender may have some form of influence on the results. This study showed that isolated girls would have more behavioural problems than isolated boys.&lt;ref&gt;Cuijpers, Koot, van Lier, Witvliet.

==Effect of cliques on the development of psychopathology in children==

Researches have often conducted studies to determine whether membership to a clique produces positive or negative development. In one 4-year study of 451 children from age nine to twelve, Miranda Witvliet along with Pol A. C. van Lier, Mara Brendgen, Hans M. Koot, and Frank Vitaro examined longitudinal associations between clique membership status and internalizing and externalizing problems during late childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brendgen | first1 = M. | last2 = van Lier | first2 = P. A. | last3 = Witvliet | first3 = M. | last4 = Koot | first4 = H.

Children from five different elementary schools in northwestern Quebec, Canada were the participants of this particular study. In the study, clique membership status was identified through [[social network analysis]], and peer nominations were used to assess internalizing and externalizing problems. The study used the program Kliquefinder to identify clique membership status through social network analysis. Through use of behavioural descriptions on the Pupil Evaluation Inventory (PEI), peer nominations of externalizing and internalizing behaviors were obtained.

Through this study, Witvliet, van Lier, Brendgen, Koot, and Vitaro noted that externalizing problems increased among clique members. They found that clique members compared with isolated children showed, on average, an increase in externalizing problems across that same period. While no sex differences were found in the link between clique membership status and internalizing problems, the association found between clique membership and an increase in externalizing problems was specific to boys only. The researchers claimed that these results support the hypothesis that clique membership protects children against developing internalizing problems.

==Decline of cliques==

During middle adolescence, the social norms that once enforced sex cleavage shift to encourage mixed-sex socialization. Single-sex cliques begin to seek out the company of opposite-sex cliques, although at first almost all direct interaction remains within the individual cliques despite the presence of the other clique(s). Gradually, intersex relationships and mixed sex cliques develop, closely followed by the first romantic relationships, which typically appear among early-pubertal, high-status, more physically developed adolescents. Over the course of late adolescence romantic relationships replace clique hierarchies as the most potent determinants of social status and networks of dating couples eventually replace more rigidly structured cliques.&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;{{rp|p.159}}&lt;ref name=Trajec/&gt;

The chronological relationship between changing gender dynamics and the dissolution of organized, hierarchical cliques is well-established, but not fully understood. One theory asserts that sex cleavage both arises and wanes because cliques are largely sorted by common interests: girls and boys are generally interested in different activities until dating emerges, after which they share a highly valued activity.&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;(164) This idea is consistent with the direct relationship between pubertal development and the appearance of other-sex friends.&lt;ref name=TextBook/&gt;{{rp|p.165}}
One possible explanation for this progression argues that children are socialized from childhood to conform to [[gender role]]s and during early adolescence [[Adolescence#Cognitive development|cognitive developments]] promote active self-presentation and anxiety over peer-perceptions; as a result, early adolescents become more consciously aware of both the benefits of conventional gender identity and the threat of ridicule or rejection in response to unorthodox behavior. According to this framework, gender segregation subsides because the same inculcated gender roles that prompt children to distance themselves from anything associated with the opposite sex also encourage adolescents and adults to demonstrate heterosexual desire and sexual/seductive competence.&lt;ref name=Negriff/&gt; This argument explains the drastic shift in the targets of ridicule from those who were too androgynous in middle school to those who can not or do not attract sexual attention in high school.

The effects of such social enforcement of gender-roles, may take the form of [[relational aggression]], [[bullying]], and [[Gay bullying#Gay bullying|gay bullying]].

==Implications==
Perhaps the most consequential finding from the empirical study of adolescent cliques is that they are not an inherently negative force, but rather part of normative development in our society. Although it is certainly true that certain cliques can negatively influence development, others can actually benefit adolescents. In cases in which clique influence is negative, it is encouraging to note that while most forms of interventions are fairly ineffective and peer group interventions frequently produce [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic effects]],&lt;ref name=Dishion95/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dishion | first1 = T.

'''Alfred Dolge''' (December 22, 1848 – January 5, 1922) was a German born industrialist, inventor, and author of two books.

Originally an importer and manufacturer of [[piano]] materials he later founded his own factory, manufacturing [[felt]] products at Brockett’s Bridge, [[Fulton County, New York]] which in 1887 was renamed to [[Dolgeville, New York]].

==Biography==
Alfred Dolge was born December 22, 1848 in [[Chemnitz]], Saxony. He attended public school in [[Leipzig]] until he was 17 when he entered his fathers’ business, the A. Dolge and Co., Piano Manufacturers, as an apprentice. He pursued high school studies in a night school conducted by the Free Masons in Leipzig and received his diploma from them. He first came to the United States in 1865, when he was 17. He remained permanently in 1868 and worked in piano making and importing in New York City.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"/&gt;
In 1874 Dolge went to Brockett's Bridge, [[Fulton County, New York]], prospecting for [[spruce]] wood to be used for piano [[sounding board]]s.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=2717|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Dolge Company Factory Complex|date=n.d.|accessdate=2010-07-21 |author=Doris Manley and Eleanor Franz|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He purchased the old Brockett building and in April 1875, he began manufacturing felt in it, later known as the [[Dolge Company Factory Complex]]. Within a few years Brockett's Bridge grew from 325 to over 2,000 inhabitants, many of whom were German immigrants, whom he had interested in the area by advertisements and agents.  Eventually, Dolge built felt mills, made felt shoes, [[autoharp]]s, piano cases, piano sounding boards, piano hammers, ran lumber yards, and contributed to the local physical infrastructure and educational needs.In 1887 the citizens unanimously petitioned the authorities at Washington to change the name of the place from Brockett’s Bridge to [[Dolgeville, New York]].&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"/&gt;

Dolge failed financially and left Dolgeville in May 1899.  He lived in California and started a business there. He died in [[Milan, Italy]] on January 5, 1922 on a round the world tour. He is buried in the Dolgeville cemetery.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"/&gt;

In late 2014, Alfred Dolge's 1895 mansion, which stood behind the historic factory complex was destroyed by fire.&lt;ref name="Dolge Mansion Destroyed By Fire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wktv.com/news/Dolgeville-residents-react-to-devastating-loss-of-the-historic-Dolge-Mansion-285036671.html |title=WKTV News: Dolge Mansion Destroyed By Fire |date=n.d. |accessdate=2014-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227151805/http://www.wktv.com/news/Dolgeville-residents-react-to-devastating-loss-of-the-historic-Dolge-Mansion-285036671.html |archivedate=December 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mansion was owned by Charles Soukup, who had recently purchased and converted the [[Dolge Company Factory Complex]].  To date{{when|date=October 2015}}, the cause of the fire has yet to be determined.

==Philosophy==
Inspired by his early readings of [[Wilhelm Liebknecht|Liebknecht]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], and [[Adam Smith]], Dolge instituted at Dolgeville a form of what we now call [[social security]] in his attempt to create an idealistic socialistic [[utopia]]. About 1876, when the factory was first well established, Dolge began to set up his [[pension|Pension Plan]] which remained almost exactly the same throughout his tenure.  It was extremely generous, ranging from 50 percent of wages for disability after 10 years service up to 100 percent after 25 years.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"/&gt;
Later he added a system of [[life insurance]] paid for by the firm.  He also instituted a program of [[Profit sharing|Earning-Sharing]] whereby an employee received a portion of the earnings according to his contribution in brains or the value of his work.  This was not to be turned over until retirement, but was to be reinvested.  The Pension Plan was non-contributory by the employee.  The employer paid all. When Dolge’s business failed in 1899, few of the benefits which he had envisioned had been paid, but the ideas which he pioneered proved to be very lasting.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"/&gt;
His ideas gained worldwide attention.  The government of Germany officially requested details of his Plan and adopted it with some changes.  In 1889, the government of France asked for a detailed account.  The insurance, pension and endowment plans instituted by Dolgeville were also copied and adapted by railroads and many other corporations in America.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"/&gt;

==Books==
In 1896, he printed a 243-page paperbound book entitled "The Practical Applications of Economic Theories in the Factories of Alfred Dolge and Son."&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"/&gt;
In 1911 he published a book on the development of the piano in Europe, America, Russia and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Ripley]] [[The Races of Europe (Ripley)|''The Races of Europe'']] (1899)]]

The '''Alpine race''' is a [[Historical race concepts|historical race concept]] defined by some late 19th-century and early 20th-century [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] as one of the sub-races of the [[Caucasian race]].&lt;ref name=Maxwell&gt;Anne Maxwell, ''Picture Imperfect: Photography and Eugenics, 1870–1940'', Sussex Academic Press, 2010, {{ISBN|1845194152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2Fx6pzonsCIC&amp;pg=PA132 Race and Racism: An Introduction] [https://www.amazon.com/Race-Racism-Introduction-Carolyn-Fluehr-Lobban/dp/0759107955# (see also)] by Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban, Pages 127-133, Publication Date: December 8, 2005, {{ISBN|0759107955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/racesofeurope.htm The Races of Europe] by Carleton S. Coon&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the Alpine race was variously identified. Ripley argued that it migrated from Central Asia during the [[Neolithic revolution]], splitting the Nordic and Mediterranean populations. It was also identified as descending from the [[Celts]] residing in [[Central Europe]] in [[Neolithic]] times.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. MacCulloch. ''Religion of the Ancient Celts''. Kessinger Publishing, 2003. P. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Alpine race is mainly distinguished by its cranial measurements, such as high [[cephalic index]]. 

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1987-121-09A, Russland, Hitler, Mussolin, von Rundstedt.jpg|thumb|215px|[[Gerd von Rundstedt|Rundstedt]], [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], Russia 1941. Hitler identified Mussolini as part of the Alpine race]]
The term "Alpine" (''H. Alpinus'') has historically been given to denote a physical type within the [[Caucasian race]], first defined by [[William Z. Ripley]] (1899), but originally proposed by [[Vacher de Lapouge]]. It is equivalent to [[Joseph Deniker]]'s "Occidental" or "Cevenole" subrace&lt;ref&gt;Les Six Races Composant la Population Actuelle de l'Europe, J. Deniker, The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Vol. 34, (Jul. - Dec., 1904), pp. 181-206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deniker's Classification of the Races of Europe, William Z. Ripley, The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Vol. 28, No. 1/2 (1899), pp. 166-173.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jan Czekanowski]] identified it, as of the ''Lappanoid'' race which means that Alpines are a mixture of Lappanoid and Armenoid. In the early 20th century the Alpine physical type was popularised by numerous anthropologists, such as [[Thomas Griffith Taylor]] and [[Madison Grant]], as well as in Soviet era anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;The Nordic and Alpine Races and Their Kin: A Study of Ethnological Trends, Griffith Taylor, American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 37, No. 1 (Jul., 1931), pp. 67-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article092529.html The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia] ''(Russian)''&lt;/ref&gt; The Homo Alpinus was first proposed by the French raciologist Georges Vacher de Lapouge, but Chanda picked it up through the writings of T. A. Joyce. 37 Like Sur, Chanda had denied any direct relationship between Bengali upper castes and north Indian upper castes. 38 Yet, this did not mean that the Bengali upper castes were autochthons; they were merely descended from a separate branch of the Aryan family tree, namely, the Homo Alpinus.

The German [[Nazi Party]] under the influence direction of [[Hans F. K. Günther]], recognized the Germans as including five Aryan racial subtypes, described by Günther in his work ''Kleine Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes'' (1929): Nordic, Alpine, Mediterranean, East Baltic, and Dinaric, viewing Nordics as being at the top of the racial hierarchy.&lt;ref name=Maxwell /&gt; He defined each racial subtype according to general physical appearance and their psychological qualities including their "racial soul" - referring to their emotional traits and religious beliefs, and provided detailed information on their hair, eye, and skin colours, facial structure.&lt;ref name=Maxwell /&gt; He provided photographs of Germans identified as Nordic in places like [[Baden]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Salzburg]], and [[Swabia]]; and provided photographs of Germans he identified as Nordic and Mediterranean types, especially in [[Bavaria]] and the Black Forest region of [[Baden]].&lt;ref name=Maxwell /&gt; Hitler was so impressed by this work by Günther, that he made it the basis of his [[eugenics]] policy.&lt;ref name=Maxwell /&gt;

Adolf Hitler utilized the term Alpine to refer to a type of the [[Aryan race]], and in an interview spoke admiringly about his idol Italian Fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]], commending Mussolini's Alpine racial heritage saying:
{{quote|They know that Benito Mussolini is constructing a colossal empire which will put the Roman Empire in the shade. We shall put up ... for his victories. Mussolini is a typical representative of our Alpine race...|Adolf Hitler, 1931&lt;ref&gt;Richard Breiting, Adolf Hitler, Édouard Calic (ed.). ''Secret conversations with Hitler:the two newly-discovered 1931 interviews''. John Day Co., 1971. P. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It however fell out of popularity by the 1950s, but reappeared in the literature of [[Sonia Mary Cole]] (1963) and Carleton Coon (1969).&lt;ref&gt;Carleton Stevens Coon, Edward E. Hunt, ''The living races of man'', Knopf, 1969, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent sources, a small array of anthropologists accustomed with such usage, still use the term.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Pearson (anthropologist)|Roger Pearson]], ''Anthropological Glossary'', Krieger Publishing Co., Malabar, Fl. 1985. [[Alice Mossie Brues]], ''People and Races'', 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical appearance==
A typical Alpine skull is regarded as [[brachycephalic]] ('broad-headed'), but may be within the [[mesocephalic]] range as well.&lt;ref&gt;The Alpine Races in Europe , John L. Myres, The Geographical Journal, Vol. 28, No. 6 (Dec., 1906), pp. 537-553.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being broad in the crania, this thickness appears generally elsewhere in the morphology of the Alpine, as Hans Günther describes:
{{quote|...the Alpine race is thick-set and broad. The average height of the Alpine man is about 1.63 metres. This small height is brought about by the relatively short, squat legs. This broadness and shortness is repeated in all the details: in the broadness of the hand and its short fingers, in the short, broad feet, in the thick, short calves.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Ripley (1899) further notes that the nose of the Alpine is broader (mesorrhine) while their hair is usually a chestnut colour and their [[occiput]]s are slightly rounded. According to [[Robert Bennett Bean]] (1932) the skin pigmentation of the Alpine is an '[[light skin|intermediate white]]', a colour in-between the lighter skinned Nordic and the darker-skinned Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;The Races of Man. Differentiation and Dispersal of Man, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the large numbers of alleged Alpines, the characteristics of the Alpines were not as widely discussed as those of the Nordics and Mediterraneans. Typically they were portrayed as "[[sedentary]]": solid peasant stock, the reliable backbone of the European population, but not outstanding for qualities of [[leadership]] or creativity. Madison Grant insisted on their "essentially [[peasant]] character".&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;Grant, Madison, ''The Passing of the Great Race'', 1916, part 2, ch. 11; part 2, chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and origin==

According to Ripley and Coon, the Alpine race is predominant in [[Central Europe]] and parts of [[West Asia|Western]]/[[Central Asia]]. Ripley argued that the Alpines had originated in [[Asia]], and had spread westwards along with the emergence and expansion of agriculture, which they established in Europe. By migrating into Central Europe, they had separated the northern and southern branches of the earlier European stock, creating the conditions for the separate evolution of Nordics and Mediterraneans. This model was repeated in Madison Grant's book ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916), in which the Alpines were portrayed as the most populous of European and western Asian races. However, in [[Carleton S. Coon|Carleton Coon]]'s rewrite of Ripley's ''The Races of Europe'', he developed a different argument that they reduced the [[Upper Paleolithic]] survivors indigenous to Europe, based on prehistoric broad-headed crania unearthed at [[Grenelle]], France, and the findings at [[Furfooz]] in the Belgian province of [[Namur (province)|Namur]]:
{{quote|...Alpine: A reduced and somewhat foetalized survivor of the Upper Palaeolithic population in Late Pleistocene France, highly brachycephalized; seems to represent in a large measure the bearer of the brachycephalic factor in Crô-Magnon. Close approximations to this type appear also in the Balkans and in the highlands of western and central Asia, suggesting that its ancestral prototype was widespread in Late Pleistocene times. In modern races it sometimes appears in a relatively pure form, sometimes as an element in mixed brachycephalic populations of multiple origin. It may have served in both Pleistocene and modern times as a bearer of the tendency toward brachycephalization into various population.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}}}

Coon further argued that they were linked to their unreduced (Brünn, Borreby) counterparts.

A debate concerning the origin of the Alpine race in Europe, involving [[Arthur Keith]], [[John Myres]] and [[Alfred Cort Haddon]] was published by the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;The Alpine Races in Europe: Discussion, D. G. Hogarth, Arthur Evans, Dr. Haddon, Dr. Shrubsall, Mr. Hudleston, Mr. Gray, Dr. Wright and Mr. Myres, The Geographical Journal, Vol. 28, No. 6 (Dec., 1906) (pp. 553-560).&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the large numbers of this alleged race, the characteristics of the Alpines were not as widely discussed and disputed as those of the Nordics and Mediterraneans. Typically they were portrayed as "sedentary": solid peasant stock, the reliable backbone of the European population, but not outstanding for qualities of leadership or creativity. Madison Grant insisted on their "essentially peasant character".&lt;ref name=Grant /&gt;

The '''Bagdis''' are [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] descended from people with [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] links found in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]] and  [[Bangladesh]].

|[[File:Barack Obama Hope poster.jpg|thumb|The most widely distributed version of Shepard Fairey's Obama poster, featuring the word "hope". Other versions used the words "change" and "progress".]]
|}
The '''Barack Obama "Hope" poster''' is an image of [[Barack Obama]] designed by artist [[Shepard Fairey]], which was widely described as iconic and came to represent his [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name="Pasick"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/photo/2009/01/15/iconic-obama-poster-based-on-reuters-photo/|title=Iconic Obama poster based on Reuters photo|last=Pasick|first=Adam|date=January 15, 2009|agency=Reuters|accessdate=January 20, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120032224/http://blogs.reuters.com/photo/2009/01/15/iconic-obama-poster-based-on-reuters-photo/|archivedate=January 20, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7872253.stm Copyright battle over Obama image]", BBC News, February 5, 2009. Retrieved February 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a stylized [[stencil]] portrait of Obama in solid red, beige and (light and dark) blue, with the word "progress", "hope" or "change" below (and other  words in some versions).

The design was created in one day and printed first as a poster. Fairey sold 290 of the posters on the street immediately after printing them. It was then more widely distributed&amp;mdash;both as a digital image and other paraphernalia&amp;mdash;during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 election season]], initially independently but with the approval of the official Obama campaign.  The image became one of the most widely recognized symbols of Obama's campaign message, spawning many variations and imitations, including some commissioned by the Obama campaign. This led ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' [[Laura Barton]] to proclaim that the image "acquired the kind of instant recognition of [[Che Guevara (photo)#Jim Fitzpatrick|Jim Fitzpatrick's Che Guevara poster]], and is surely set to grace T-shirts, coffee mugs and the walls of student bedrooms in the years to come."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/10/barackobama-usa Hope - the Image that is Already an American Classic] by Laura Barton, ''The Guardian'', November 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, after Obama had won the election, Fairey's [[mixed-media]] stenciled portrait version of the image was acquired by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for its [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]].  Later in January 2009, the photograph on which Fairey based the poster was revealed: a June 2006 shot by former [[Associated Press]] freelance photographer [[Mannie Garcia]].  In response to claims by the [[Associated Press]] for compensation, Fairey sued for a [[declaratory judgment]] that his poster was a [[fair use]] of the original photograph. The parties settled out of court in January 2011, with details of the settlement remaining confidential.

On February 29, 2012, Fairey pleaded guilty in a New York federal court to destroying and fabricating documents during his legal battle with the Associated Press. Fairey had sued the news service in 2008 after it claimed that the famous poster was based on one of its photos. Fairey claimed that he used a different photograph for the poster. But he admitted that, in fact, he was wrong and tried to hide the error by destroying documents and manufacturing others, which is the source of the one count of criminal contempt to which he pleaded guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/creator-of-popular-obama-hope-poster-pleads-to-criminal-contempt-charge-in-nyc/2012/02/24/gIQAoEH3XR_story.html|title=- The Washington Post|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, Fairey was sentenced to two years of [[probation]], 300 hours of [[community service]], and a fine of $25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-shepard-fairey-20120908,0,6021274.story|title=Shepard Fairey sentenced to probation, fine in Obama 'Hope' case|author=David Ng|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 8, 2012|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Fairey's Obama portrait was featured in the book ''[[Art For Obama: Designing Manifest Hope and the Campaign for Change]]'' which Fairey also edited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2008-09-11/columns/yosi-sergant-and-the-art-of-change-the-publicist-behind-shepard-fairey-39-s-obama-hope-posters/|title=Yosi Sergant and the Art of Change: The Publicist Behind Shepard Fairey's Obama Hope Posters|first=Seven|last=Mcdonald|date=September 10, 2008|website=laweekly.com|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obeygiant.com/headlines/art-for-obama-book Obeythegiant.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' in 2015 Fairey said that Obama had not lived up, "not even close," to his expectations. He continued, "Obama has had a really tough time, but there have been a lot of things that he's compromised on that I never would have expected. I mean, drones and domestic spying are the last things I would have thought [he'd support]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/interviews/a35288/shepard-fairey-street-art-obama-hope-poster/|title=Fairey: Obama Didn't Live Up to My 'Hope' Poster|author=|date=May 28, 2015|website=esquire.com|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept and design ==
[[Shepard Fairey]], who had created earlier political [[street art]] critical of government and of [[George W. Bush]], discussed the nascent Obama campaign with publicist [[Yosi Sergant]] in late October 2007.  Sergant suggested Fairey create some art in support of Obama.  Sergant contacted the Obama campaign to seek its permission for Fairey to design an Obama poster, which was granted a few weeks before [[Super Tuesday]]. Fairey has said that his decision to create a portrait of Obama stemmed from Fairey's feeling that Obama's "power and sincerity as a speaker would create a positive association with his likeness."&lt;ref name=JOLT /&gt; Fairey found a photograph of Obama using [[Google Image Search]] (eventually revealed to be an April 2006 photo by freelancer [[Mannie Garcia]] for The [[Associated Press]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mac.com/manniegarcia/iWeb/mannie%20garcia/Hope.html Mannie Garcia] website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gralish2"/&gt; and created the original poster design in a single day.  The original image had the word "{{smallcaps|progress}}" and featured Fairey's signature {{smallcaps|obey}} star&amp;mdash;a symbol associated with his ''[[Andre the Giant Has a Posse]]'' street art campaign&amp;mdash;embedded in the Obama campaign's [[Obama logo|sunrise logo]].&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;Ben Arnon, "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ben-arnon/how-the-obama-hope-poster_b_133874.html How the Obama "Hope" Poster Reached a Tipping Point and Became a Cultural Phenomenon: An Interview With the Artist Shepard Fairey]", ''[[Huffington Post]]'', October 13, 2009. Retrieved January 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the Obama campaign's concerns about the troublesome connotations of the original wording, Fairey changed the slogan printed under Obama's image from "{{smallcaps|progress}}" to "{{smallcaps|hope}}."&lt;ref name=JOLT&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher III|first=William W. |author2=Frank Cost |author3=Shepard Fairey |author4=Meir Feder |author5=Edwin Fountain |author6=Geoffrey Stewart |author7=Marita Sturken|title=Reflections on the Hope Poster Case|journal=Harvard Journal of Law and Technology|date=Spring 2012|volume=25|issue=2|url=http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v25/25HarvJLTech243.pdf|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to design writer [[Steven Heller (graphic design)|Steven Heller]], the poster was inspired by [[Social Realism]] and, while widely praised as original and unique, can be seen as part of a long tradition of contemporary artists drawing inspiration from political candidates and producing "posters that break the mold not only in terms of color and style but also in message and tone."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Heller, "[http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/shepard-fairey/ Beyond Red, White and Blue]", ''Campaign Stops Blog'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 15, 2008. Retrieved February 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Fairey has said, "My historical inspiration was the well-known JFK portrait where he is posed in a three-quarters view looking slightly upward and out into the distance. The image of Lincoln on the five-dollar bill has a similar feel."&lt;ref name=JOLT /&gt;

==Distribution during the 2008 campaign==
Fairey began [[screen-printing]] posters soon after completing the design and showing it to Yosi Sergant. Initially, he sold 350 and put 350 more up in public. Beginning with that sale and continuing throughout the campaign, Fairey used proceeds from selling the image to produce more of it; after first printing, he made 4,000 more that were distributed at Obama rallies before [[Super Tuesday, 2008|Super Tuesday]]. He also put a printable digital version on his website. As Fairey explained in an October 2008 interview, the image quickly [[Viral phenomenon|went viral]], spreading spontaneously through [[social media]] and [[word of mouth]].&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;

After the initial 700 posters, the Obama campaign conveyed through Sergant that they wanted to promote the theme of ''hope'', and most of the posters sold by Fairey subsequently had the word "{{smallcaps|hope}}" and later "{{smallcaps|change}}" instead of "{{smallcaps|progress}}"; the {{smallcaps|obey}} star was also absent from later versions. By October 2008, Fairey and Sergant claimed to have printed 300,000 posters (with less than 2,000 sold and the rest given away or displayed) and 1,000,000 stickers, as well as clothing and other items with the image sold through Fairey's website, in addition to copies printed by others.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Booth, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/artsandliving/style/features/2008/obama-poster-051808/graphic.html Street Artist Fairey Gives Obama a Line of Cred], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 18, 2008. Retrieved January 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Fairey and Sergant, proceeds from sales of the image were used to produce more posters and other merchandise in support of the Obama campaign, rather than direct profit for Fairey.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;

==Parodies and imitations==
As the campaign progressed, many [[parody|parodies]] and imitations of Fairey's design appeared.  For example, one anti-Obama version replaced the word "{{smallcaps|hope}}" with "{{smallcaps|hype}}", while parody posters featuring opponents [[Sarah Palin]] and [[John McCain]] had the word "{{smallcaps|nope}}".&lt;ref&gt;Kate Linthicum, "[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/09/nation/na-trailfairey9 Artist’s Obama poster spawns wave of parodies]", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', October 8, 2008. Retrieved February 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2009 ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine launched a site allowing users to create their own versions of the poster.  More than 10,000 images were uploaded to the site in its first two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/printArticle/573737 |title=How you, too, can look and talk like Obama |work=The Star| location=Toronto | deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023010407/http://www.thestar.com/printArticle/573737 |archive-date=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foliomag.com/2009/paste-s-obama-site-surpasses-magazine-s-online-traffic-less-week|title=Paste’s Obama Site Surpasses Magazine’s Online Traffic in Less Than a Week - Folio:|author=|date=January 19, 2009|website=foliomag.com|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/01/make-your-own-o.html|title=ABC News|author=|date=|website=abcnews.com|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine parodied the "{{smallcaps|hope}}" poster with an "[[Alfred E. Neuman]] for President!" poster. Alfred was on the poster, and the word "{{smallcaps|hope}}" was replaced with "{{smallcaps|hopeless}}". Anti-Gaddafi protesters in Chicago, in solidarity with the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], have co-opted the image.
[[Dynamite Comics]] released a four-part crossover with Obama and [[Ash Williams]] of their ''[[Army of Darkness (comics)|Army of Darkness]]'' comics and the ''[[Evil Dead]]'' films. One of the issues covers had a picture of Ash Williams (played by [[Bruce Campbell]] in the films) in the style of the "Hope" poster with the bottom text reading "Hope?"

Fairey was also commissioned to create a number of works in the same style. He produced two other versions, based on different photographs, officially on behalf of the Obama campaign,&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Powers, "[http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Shepard+Fairey%3A+Purveyor+of+Hope/ Shepard Fairey: Purveyor of Hope]", ''[[SuicideGirls]]'', December 12, 2008. Retrieved February 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and another to serve as the cover of the ''[[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]]'' issue of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Stelter, "[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/22/business/22time.php Time cover sure looks a lot like a campaign image]", ''International Herald Tribune'', December 22, 2008. Retrieved February 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also created a portrait of comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] in the same style, which appeared in an issue of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' honoring Colbert's television show ''[[The Colbert Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Colbert, "[http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/215976/january-15-2009/shepard-fairey Shepard Fairey]", ''The Colbert Report'', January 15, 2009. Retrieved February 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Firas Alkhateeb, the student who designed the controversial [[Barack Obama "Joker" poster|Obama "Joker" image]], cited Fairey as being his greatest influence.&lt;ref name=thenational&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090901/LIFE/708319970/1239 | title=The joke’s on who? | last=Good | first=Oliver | date=September 1, 2009 | work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |location=Abu Dhabi | accessdate=September 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alkhateeb described the "Joker" image as a corrective to Fairey's glowing portrayal of Obama.&lt;ref name=thenational/&gt;&lt;ref name=chicagotribune&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/chi-0819-obama-jokeraug19,0,4266819.story | title=Talking to the Chicago college student who may be behind Obama-as-Joker poster | last=Borrelli | first=Christopher | date=August 19, 2009 | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | accessdate=September 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairey has both criticized and praised the "Joker" poster, stating "The artwork is great in that it gets a point across really quickly", but "I don't agree with the political content of the poster".&lt;ref name=chicagotribune/&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/08/obama-joker-shepard-fairey.html | title=Shepard Fairey has 'doubts' about intelligence of Obama Joker artist | last=Milian | first=Mark | date=August 10, 2009 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate=September 25, 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090812204954/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/08/obama-joker-shepard-fairey.html| archivedate= August 12, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative satire site The People's Cube made visual and verbal punning images, such as "Chaos" with an image of [[Rush Limbaugh]] ("Operation Chaos"), "Shrugged" with an image of [[Ayn Rand]] (for her novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'') and "Marxism" with an image of [[Groucho Marx]].

The September 2009 issue of ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', America's oldest-continuing [[LGBT]] publication, featured a cover image similar to Fairey's design.  The blue and red coloring was replaced with pink and purple, but instead of "{{smallcaps|hope}}", the caption was "{{smallcaps|nope?}}".&lt;ref name=advocate&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8297500.stm | title=Obama: Letting down gay supporters? | last=Mirchandani | first=Rajesh | authorlink=Rajesh Mirchandani | date=October 10, 2009 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | accessdate=October 10, 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091013081840/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8297500.stm| archivedate= October 13, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jon Barrett, the magazine's [[editor-in-chief]], said the cover expressed the frustration among some [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] members of the [[Gay community|LGBT community]].&lt;ref name=advocate/&gt;
[[File:Giant Veep Maybe season 5 billboard.jpg|thumb|''Veep'' promotional poster on the side of a building]]
The poster has also been parodied in popular culture. In the [[Futurama]] episode "[[Proposition Infinity]]," a similar poster of President [[Richard Nixon]] can be seen, with the slogan "DESPAIR". In the 2010 movie ''[[Megamind]]'', a version of the poster can be seen using Megamind's visage and the caption "NO YOU CAN'T", parodying Obama's campaign slogan "[[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008#Slogan|Yes we can]]". [[Disney]]'s animated series ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' has two episodes, "Nerds of a Feather" and "She's the Mayor", both with Obama's poster parodied with [[Candace Flynn|Candace's]] face. American heavy metal band [[Five Finger Death Punch]] has released a version with their mascot and the words "WAR", referring to their album ''[[War Is The Answer]]''.  In ''[[Iron Man 2]],'' [[Tony Stark]] receives a similar poster of the [[Iron Man]] armor and hangs it in his Malibu garage, much to the displeasure of his assistant and love interest [[Pepper Potts]]. The 4th season of ''[[BoJack Horseman]]'' features Mr. Peanutbutter's version of the poster as he's running for governor. [[File:Honest_Gil_Fulbright_SOLD_Poster.jpg|thumb|Honest Gil Fulbright SOLD Poster]]

===Honest Gil Fulbright===
[[Shepard Fairey]] created an adaptation of the Obama HOPE poster for satirical Kentucky politician Honest Gil Fulbright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/08/11/why-the-artist-behind-obamas-hope-poster-is-helping-a-fake-candidate/|title=Why the artist behind Obama’s ‘Hope’ poster is helping a fake candidate|first=Sean|last=Sullivan|date=August 11, 2014|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poster for Honest Gil Fulbright features a portrait of [[Frank L. Ridley]], the actor who portrays Fulbright, with the words "SOLD," which refers to Fulbright's "honest" political message: "''I'm only in this thing for the money, but at least I'm honest about it.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/GilFulbright|title=Gil Fulbright: Honest Politician|author=|date=|website=www.facebook.com|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Veep ===
[[Home Box Office (HBO)]] created a parody of the poster to promote the fifth season of their satire comedy ''[[Veep (TV series)|Veep]]''. The poster was placed on roadside billboards,&lt;ref&gt;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0ScGC7IOTMg/VxJ_uNk8r5I/AAAAAAACSrM/4cuJyXpIX9UXKZvarC5Qs6g5F_ocjXSsACLcB/s800/Veep%2BMaybe%2Bseason%2B5%2Bbillboard.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; and other public places to help promote the return.

===Fairey's adaptation for the Occupy movement===
[[File:Shepard Fairey Occupy Poster.jpg|left|thumb|Fairey's 2011 adaptation for the [[occupy movement]]]]
Sympathizing with the [[Occupy movement]], in November 2011 [[Shepard Fairey]] introduced a variation of his "Hope" poster. In the new poster, he featured a [[Guy Fawkes mask]], and the message "Mister President, we HOPE you're on our side", with the word "HOPE" in large font and the rest of the sentence in small font. The Obama campaign logo on the right was replaced by a similar logo with the inscription "[[We are the 99%]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/shepard-fairey-asks-obama-to-support-occupy/2011/11/18/gIQAvzcQZN_blog.html|title=Shepard Fairey asks Obama to support Occupy|last=Bell|first=Melissa|date=November 20, 2011|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition by Smithsonian==
On January 7, 2009, the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] announced it had acquired Fairey's hand-finished [[collage]] ([[stencil]] and [[acrylic paint|acrylic]] on paper) version of the image (with the word "{{smallcaps|hope}}"), which the gallery said would go on display shortly before [[Barack Obama 2009 presidential inauguration|Obama's inauguration]] on January 20, 2009.  The work was commissioned and later donated by art collectors Heather and Tony Podesta (Tony is the brother of Obama's transition co-chairman [[John Podesta]]). It is an unusual acquisition, in that the National Portrait Gallery normally collects official portraits as presidents are leaving office rather than before they take office.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://face2face.si.edu/my_weblog/2009/01/npg-acquires-shepard-faireys-portrait-of-barack-obama.html NPG Acquires Shepard Fairey’s Portrait of Barack Obama]," National Portrait Gallery, January 7, 2009.

The original source photograph Fairey based the poster on was not publicly known until after Obama had won the election. After a mistaken attribution to [[Reuters]] photographer Jim Young for a similar-looking January 2007 photograph, in January 2009 photographer and blogger [[Tom Gralish]] discovered that the poster was based on an Associated Press photograph by freelance photographer [[Mannie Garcia]]. It was taken at a 2006 media event with [[Kansas]] Senator [[Sam Brownback]], where the actor [[George Clooney]] was raising awareness of the [[War in Darfur]] after a trip to [[Sudan]] he had taken with his father.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Gralish, "[http://blogs.phillynews.com/inquirer/sceneonroad/obama_poster_photo_mystery/ Obama Poster Photo Mystery Archives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125223620/http://blogs.phillynews.com/inquirer/sceneonroad/obama_poster_photo_mystery/ |date=January 25, 2009 }}", ''Scene on the Road'', December 22, 2008 through January 23, 2009.

In February 2009, the Associated Press announced that it determined "that the photograph used in the poster is an AP photo and that its use required permission" and announced they were in discussions with Fairey's attorney to discuss an amicable solution.&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/2009-02-04-AP-obama_N.htm | title=AP alleges copyright infringement of Obama image | last=Elliott | first=Philip | date=February 4, 2009 | agency=Associated Press | work=[[USA Today]] | accessdate=October 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairey was represented by Anthony Falzone, executive director of the [[Fair Use Project]] at [[Stanford University]]. Falzone was quoted in the press release: "We believe fair use protects Shepard's right to do what he did here."&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt; Fairey subsequently filed a federal lawsuit against the Associated Press, seeking a [[declaratory judgment]] that his use of the AP photograph was protected by the [[fair use]] doctrine and so did not infringe their copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/09/shepard-fairey-sues-associated-press-over-obama-poster/|title=Shepard Fairey Sues Associated Press Over Obama Poster|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 9, 2009|accessdate=February 9, 2009 | first=Dave | last=Itzkoff| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090211080158/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/09/shepard-fairey-sues-associated-press-over-obama-poster/| archivedate= February 11, 2009 | deadurl= no}} The case is ''Shepard Fairey; Obey Giant Art Inc. v. The Associated Press'', No. 09-CV-1123, [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|S.D.N.Y.]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairey subsequently admitted that he had based the poster on the AP photograph and had fabricated and destroyed evidence to hide the fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/18/arts/design/18fairey.html|title=Artist Admits Using Other Photo for ‘Hope’ Poster|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 17, 2009|accessdate=November 5, 2009 | first=Liz | last=Robbins| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121114054518/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/18/arts/design/18fairey.html| archivedate=November 14, 2012| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairey's admission came after one of his employees told him that he had discovered relevant documents on an old hard drive. Realizing that these documents would reveal his cover-up, Fairey told the truth to his attorney.&lt;ref name=JOLT /&gt;

Photographer Mannie Garcia contended that he retained copyright to the photo according to his AP contract. He said that he was "so proud of the photograph and that Fairey did what he did artistically with it, and the effect it had," but that he did not "condone people taking things, just because they can, off the Internet."&lt;ref name="Kennedy NTY"/&gt; Fairey countered that his conduct did not constitute "improper appropriation" because he had not taken any protected expression from Garcia's original photo. In addition, he claimed his behavior would qualify as a [[fair use]]. At trial AP would have to address both arguments.&lt;ref name=JOLT /&gt;

A judge urged a settlement, stating that AP would win the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Itzkoff |first=Dave |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/29/arts/design/29arts-JUDGEURGESRE_BRF.html |date=May 29, 2010 |title=Judge Urges Resolution in Use of Obama Photo |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP and Shepard Fairey settled out of court in January 2011. In a press release, the AP announced that the AP and Fairey "agreed to work together going forward with the Hope image and share the rights to make the posters and merchandise bearing the Hope image and to collaborate on a series of images that Fairey will create based on AP photographs. The parties have agreed to additional financial terms that will remain confidential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ap.org/pages/about/pressreleases/pr_01122011a.html|title=AP and Shepard Fairey announce agreement in Obama poster case|date=January 12, 2011|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate criminal action, federal prosecutors suggested that Fairey should face prison time for the destruction of evidence in the case, with the government sentencing request stating that "[a] sentence without any term of imprisonment sends a terrible message to those who might commit the same sort of criminal conduct. Encouraging parties to game the civil litigation system [...] creates terrible incentives and subverts the truth-finding function of civil litigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/shepard-fairey-sentencing-report-683412 |title=Feds Seek Prison Time For Obama "Hope" Artist |publisher=The Smoking Gun |date=September 5, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his sentence was ultimately limited to 300 hours of community service and a $30,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/shepard-fairey-dodges-prison-683412 |title=No Prison Time For Obama "Hope" Artist In Federal Contempt Case, Judge Rules |publisher=The Smoking Gun |date=September 7, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The '''Behna''' (Mansoori) are the Muslim community found in the state of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar pradesh, Bihar, and north India.&lt;ref name="A Hasan pages 240"&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII  Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 240 to 243&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==

The word Behna comes from the Sanskrit behn or seed. They were historically the community consists of local converts and foreigners who migrated from outside subcontinent Persia and Afghanistan, and have been involved in the traditional occupation of cotton ginning/trading[8]. Some of '''Mansoori''' is converted Muslims and Those people believes in their original '''Rajput''' caste. According to history, they came from Rajasthan to Gujarat at the time of the form of Ran Singh and resided here. Even today, their main caste - Rao, Deora, Chauhan, Bhati, which is also a Rajput clan[2]. The main origin of this community from Afghanistan and some of whose converted Muslim from Rajput's. But they were called Behna, Dhuna by the Hindu community and it's also mentioned that dhuna, Behna was stated to the Hindu carder not for Muslims.[4] Until some times ago no name in this community as surname, now some people using '''Pathan/Khan''' and some using '''Mansoori''' as a surname because the ancestor's of this community was Persian Muslims and from Afghanistan.[1] '''Tipu Sultan''' (Sultan Fateh Ali Khan Bahadur Tipu) belongs this community.

The community is concentrated in the [[Awadh]] and [[Rohilkhand]] regions, with those in [[Awadh]] speaking both [[Urdu]] and [[Awadhi]], and those in [[Rohilkhand]] speaking [[Khari boli]]. In [[Rohilkhand]], the community is found mainly in the districts of [[Bareilly District|Bareilly]], [[Bijnor District|Bijnor]], [[Moradabad District|Moradabad]], and [[Rampur District|Rampur]]. While in [[Awadh]], they are found in the districts of [[Sitapur District|Sitapur]], [[Hardoi District|Hardoi]], [[Lakhimpur Kheri District|Kheri]], [[Lucknow District|Lucknow]], [[Barabanki District|Barabanki]], [[Bahraich District|Bahraich]], [[Faizabad District|Faizabad]] and [[Gonda District|Gonda]]. .&lt;ref name="A Hasan pages 240"/&gt;

==Present circumstances==

Their historical traditional occupation of cotton carding was affected by industrialisation, therefore many adopted manufacturing. They are successful businessmen. This community are no longer as cotton carder and cotton industrialists. They entered in different  different  sectors and getting well educations. They allow marriages in their own caste, some times they can allow marriage  with the same status caste.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII  Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das peage 243&lt;/ref&gt;

[2]Until some times ago no name in this community as surname, now some people using Pathan/Khan and some using Mansoori as a surname because the ancestor's of this community were Persian Muslims and from Afghanistan.

The Mansoori are [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]] of the [[Barelvi]] &amp; [[Deoband]] sect. They speak [[Urdu]], and various dialects of [[Hindi]]. Their customs are similar to other [[Muslims of Uttar Pradesh|Uttar Pradesh Muslim]]s.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII  Part  One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 243&lt;/ref&gt;

Many members of this community migrated to [[Pakistan]] in 1947 and have settled in [[Karachi]].

[p] and [f] are in free variation.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt; /ɗ/ only occurs in the word /jalɗa~jaltʼa/ 'crooked'.&lt;ref name="y4-5" /&gt; Yilma (2002) found /ɓ/ to occur five times in around 550 lexical items.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt; He also found /ʑ/ occurring in two, both in the sequence /iʑa/.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt; Occurrence of /ɗ/ and /pʼ/ may be governed by dialectual variation.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

===Vowels===

/a/ is realized as [ə] in unstressed word-medial syllables.&lt;ref name="y6"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yilma|2002|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Length is minimally contrastive.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt; Minimal pairs include /mola/ 'fish', /moːla/ 'egg'; /masa/ 'to wash', /maːsa/ 'leopard'; /buna/ 'flower', /buːna/ 'coffee'.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

===Suprasegmentals===
Chara has phonemic stress.&lt;ref name="y6" /&gt; Examples: /ˈbakʼa/ 'to slap', /baˈkʼa/ 'empty'; /ˈwoja/ 'to come', /woˈja/ 'wolf'.&lt;ref name="y6" /&gt;

===Morphophonemics===
Morpheme-initial nasals assimilate [[point of articulation]] to that of the preceding consonant, usually found when verbs are suffixed with the singular imperative morpheme /-na/, e.g. /dub-na/ 'to hit.imp' → [dubma] 'hit!'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yilma|2002|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==

===Morphology===
Chara generally uses noun case suffixes and [[postpositions]].&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;

Nouns are inflected for gender, number, definiteness, case, and possession.&lt;ref name="y8"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yilma|2002|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are all suffixes, except for the possessive.&lt;ref name="y8" /&gt;

Gender pairs are usually lexical, except for a few with /-i/ in the masculine and /-a/ in the feminine.&lt;ref name="y8" /&gt; Examples:&lt;ref name="y8" /&gt;
:/mansa/ 'ox', /mija/ 'cow'
:/izi/ 'he', /iza/ 'she'

Nouns and adjectives inflect for plural with the suffix /-eːndi/.&lt;ref name="y8" /&gt; Examples:&lt;ref name="y8-9"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yilma|2002|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:/ina/ 'mother', /ineːndi/ 'mothers'
:/dala/ 'while (sg.)', /daleːndi/ 'white (pl.)'

Definiteness in nouns is marked with the suffix /-naːzi/ (as an independent word meaning 'the male/man') for masculines and /-ena/ for feminines.&lt;ref name="y9"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yilma|2002|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjectives take /-bi/ in the masculine and /-ena/ in the feminine.&lt;ref name="y9" /&gt; Examples:&lt;ref name="y9" /&gt;
:/mansa/ 'ox', /mansanaːzi/ 'the ox'
:/mija/ 'cow', /mijena/ 'the cow/
:/karta/ 'black', /kartabi/ 'the black (m.)', /kartena/ 'the black (f.)'

Nouns and adjectives may be marked for [[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[dative]], [[genitive]], [[ablative]], [[instrumental]], or [[vocative case]].&lt;ref name="y9-11"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yilma|2002|pp=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nominative suffix is /-i/, accusative /-(i)s/, dative /-(i)ri/, genitive /-e/, ablative /-kaj/, instrumental /-ne/, and vocative /-o/.&lt;ref name="y9-11" /&gt;

===Syntax===
Chara is a [[subject–object–verb]] language.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;

Adjectives end in /-a/ like nouns, and inflect for number, definiteness, plurality, and case.&lt;ref name="y11"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yilma|2002|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In noun phrases adjectives precede their nouns, and are not inflected.&lt;ref name="y11" /&gt;

'''Child sexual abuse''', also called '''child molestation''', is a form of [[child abuse]] in which an adult or older adolescent uses a [[child]] for [[sexual stimulation]].&lt;ref name=medline2008&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/childsexualabuse.html |title=Child Sexual Abuse |work=Medline Plus|date = 2008-04-02 |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine,}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA Guidelines"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Guidelines for psychological evaluations in child protection matters.

Child sexual abuse can occur in a variety of settings, including home, school, or work (in places where [[child labor]] is common). [[Child marriage]] is one of the main forms of child sexual abuse; [[UNICEF]] has stated that child marriage "represents perhaps the most prevalent form of sexual abuse and exploitation of girls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/chinese/protection/files/Child_Marriage.pdf|title=UNICEF|website=unicef.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of child sexual abuse can include [[Depression (mood)|depression]],&lt;ref name="Roosa"/&gt; [[post-traumatic stress disorder]],&lt;ref name="widom"/&gt; [[anxiety]],&lt;ref name="levitan"/&gt; [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jts.2490100403 |title=Complex PTSD in victims exposed to sexual and physical abuse: Results from the DSM-IV field trial for posttraumatic stress disorder |year=1997|last1=Roth |first1=Susan |last2=Newman |first2=Elana |last3=Pelcovitz |first3=David |last4=Van Der Kolk |first4=Bessel|last5=Mandel |first5=Francine S.|journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=539–55 |pmid=9391940}}&lt;/ref&gt; propensity to further [[victimization]] in adulthood,&lt;ref name="Messman-Moore"/&gt; and physical injury to the child, among other problems.&lt;ref name="dinw"/&gt; Sexual abuse by a family member is a form of [[incest]] and can result in more serious and long-term [[psychological trauma]], especially in the case of [[parental incest]].&lt;ref name=Courtois&gt;{{Cite book|last=Courtois |first=Christine A. |title=Healing the incest wound: adult survivors in therapy |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1988 |page=208 |isbn=0-393-31356-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global prevalence of child sexual abuse has been estimated at 19.7% for females and 7.9% for males.&lt;ref name="pereda" /&gt; Most sexual abuse offenders are acquainted with their victims; approximately 30% are relatives of the child, most often brothers, fathers, uncles, or cousins;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsopw.gov/en-US/Education/FactsStatistics?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1|title=Raising Awareness About Sexual Abuse: Facts and Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=NSOPW|access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; around 60% are other acquaintances, such as "friends" of the family, babysitters, or neighbors; strangers are the offenders in approximately 10% of child sexual abuse cases.&lt;ref name=Whealin/&gt; Most child sexual abuse is committed by men; studies on female child molesters show that women commit 14% to 40% of offenses reported against boys and 6% of offenses reported against girls.&lt;ref name=Whealin/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finkelhor1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Dube SR, Anda RF, Whitfield CL, etal |title=Long-term consequences of childhood sexual abuse by gender of victim|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=430–438|date=June 2005|pmid=15894146 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2005.01.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kendler et al. (2000) found that most of the relationship between severe forms of child sexual abuse and adult psychopathology in their sample could not be explained by family discord, because the [[effect size]] of this association decreased only slightly after they controlled for possible confounding variables. Their examination of a small sample of CSA-discordant twins also supported a causal link between child sexual abuse and adult psychopathology; the CSA-exposed subjects had a consistently higher risk for psychopathologic disorders than their CSA non-exposed twins.&lt;ref name="pmid11015813"/&gt;

A 1998 meta-analysis by [[Bruce Rind]] et al. generated [[Rind et al. controversy|controversy]] by suggesting that child sexual abuse does not always cause pervasive harm, that some college students reported such encounters as positive experiences and that the extent of psychological damage depends on whether or not the child described the encounter as "consensual."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/00224499709551891 |title=A meta-analytic review of findings from national samples on psychological correlates of child sexual abuse |year=1997 |last1=Rind |first1=Bruce |last2=Tromovitch |first2=Philip |journal=Journal of Sex Research |volume=34 |pages=237–255|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was criticized for flawed methodology and conclusions.&lt;ref name="LC Dallam"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Dallam SJ, Gleaves DH, Cepeda-Benito A, Silberg JL, Kraemer HC, Spiegel D |title=The effects of child sexual abuse: Comment on Rind, Tromovitch, and Bauserman (1998) |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=127 |issue=6 |pages=715–33 |date=November 2001 |pmid=11726068 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.6.715}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Oltmanns |first1=Thomas F. |last2=Emery |first2=Robert E. |title=Abnormal Psychology |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2001 |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=0-13-187521-3}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Congress condemned the study for its conclusions and for providing material used by pedophile organizations to justify their activities.&lt;ref name="congress"&gt;{{cite web|author=US Congress|year=1999|title=Whereas no segment of our society is more critical to the future of human survival than our children|format=PDF|work=106th Congress, Resolution 107|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:hc107enr.txt.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In severe cases, damage to internal organs may occur, which, in some cases, may cause death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/08884310420001679386 |title=Child Sexual Abuse: A Public Health Issue |year=2004 |last1=Anderson |first1=James |last2=Mangels |first2=Nancie |last3=Langsam |first3=Adam |journal=The Justice Professional |volume=17 |pages=107–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Infections====
Child sexual abuse may cause infections and [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.&lt;ref name="jong"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=De Jong AR |title=Vaginitis due to Gardnerella vaginalis and to Candida albicans in sexual abuse |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=27–9 |year=1985 |pmid=3872154 |doi=10.1016/0145-2134(85)90088-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a lack of sufficient [[Vaginal lubrication|vaginal fluid]], chances of infections can heighten depending on the age and size of the child. [[Vaginitis]] has also been reported.&lt;ref name="jong" /&gt;

====Neurological damage====
Research has shown that traumatic stress, including stress caused by sexual abuse, causes notable changes in brain functioning and development.&lt;ref&gt;Developing Mind, Daniel Siegel, Guilford Press, 1999{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Maia Szalavitz |author2=Perry, Bruce |title=The boy who was raised as a dog: and other stories from a child psychiatrist's notebook: what traumatized children can teach us about loss, love and healing |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-465-05652-0}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various studies have suggested that severe child sexual abuse may have a deleterious effect on brain development.

Some studies indicate that sexual or physical abuse in children can lead to the overexcitation of an undeveloped [[limbic system]].&lt;ref name="scars" /&gt; Teicher et al. (1993)&lt;ref name="epi" /&gt; used the "Limbic System Checklist-33" to measure ictal temporal lobe epilepsy-like symptoms in 253 adults. Reports of child sexual abuse were associated with a 49% increase to LSCL-33 scores, 11% higher than the associated increase of self-reported physical abuse. Reports of both physical and sexual abuse were associated with a 113% increase. Male and female victims were similarly affected.&lt;ref name="epi" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Joan |last1=Arehart-Treichel |date=March 2001 |title=Psychological Abuse May Cause Changes in Brain |journal=Psychiatric News |volume=36 |issue=5 |page=36 |url=http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/content/36/5/36.full |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320035637/http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/content/36/5/36.full |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Navalta et al. (2006) found that the self-reported math [[Scholastic Aptitude Test]] scores of their sample of women with a history of repeated child sexual abuse were significantly lower than the self-reported math SAT scores of their non-abused sample. Because the abused subjects' verbal SAT scores were high, they hypothesized that the low math SAT scores could "stem from a defect in hemispheric integration." They also found a strong association between short-term memory impairments for all categories tested (verbal, visual, and global) and the duration of the abuse.&lt;ref name="navalta"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Navalta CP, Polcari A, Webster DM, Boghossian A, Teicher MH |title=Effects of childhood sexual abuse on neuropsychological and cognitive function in college women |journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=45–53 |year=2006 |pmid=16525070 |doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.18.1.45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prevalence of parental child sexual abuse is difficult to assess due to secrecy and privacy; some estimates state that 20 million Americans have been victimized by parental incest as children.&lt;ref name=Turner /&gt;

==Types==
Child sexual abuse includes a variety of sexual offenses, including:
* ''[[sexual assault]]'' – a term defining offenses in which an adult uses a minor for the purpose of sexual gratification; for example, [[rape]] (including [[sodomy]]), and sexual penetration with an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=David |last1=Finkelhor |first2=Richard |last2=Ormrod |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/187238.pdf |title=Child Abuse Reported to the Police |journal=Juvenile Justice Bulletin |publisher=U.S. Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention |date=May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most U.S. states include, in their definitions of sexual assault, any penetrative contact of a minor’s body, however slight, if the contact is performed for the purpose of sexual gratification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/defineall.pdf ''Definitions of Child Abuse and Neglect, Summary of State Laws,''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025174014/http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/defineall.pdf |date=2007-10-25 }} National Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Commercial sexual exploitation of children|sexual exploitation]]'' – a term defining offenses in which an adult victimizes a minor for advancement, sexual gratification, or profit; for example, prostituting a child,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=David |last1=Finkelhor |first2=Richard |last2=Ormrod |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/html/ojjdp/203946/contents.html |title=Prostitution of Juveniles: Patterns From NIBRS |journal=Juvenile Justice Bulletin |publisher=U.S. Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention |date=June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and creating or trafficking in child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/exploit.txt ''Child Sexual Exploitation: Improving Investigations and Protecting Victims,''] Massachusetts Child Exploitation Network, U.S. Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, January 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Child grooming|sexual grooming]]'' – a term defining the social conduct of a potential child sex offender who seeks to make a minor more accepting of their advances, for example in an online [[chat room]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.co.uk/tsearch/grooming+chatroom.htm Grooming chatroom Content at ZDNet UK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial sexual exploitation===
{{Main|Commercial sexual exploitation of children}}

Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) is defined by the Declaration of the First World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, held in Stockholm in 1996, as "sexual abuse by an adult accompanied by remuneration in cash or in kind to the child or third person(s)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/eapro/Fact_sheet_SexualExploitation.pdf|title=UNICEF|website=unicef.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSEC usually takes the form of [[child prostitution]] or [[child pornography]], and is often facilitated by [[child sex tourism]]. CSEC is particularly a problem in developing countries of [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unescap.org/pmd/documents/me/Sexual%20abuse.pdf Unescap.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222151144/http://www.unescap.org/pmd/documents/me/Sexual%20abuse.pdf |date=February 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/rosa/commercial.pdf|title=UNICEF|website=unicef.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, new innovations in technology have facilitated the trade of Internet child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/eapro/activities_3757.html|title=What we do – Commercial sexual exploitation of children|work=unicef.org|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disclosure==
[[File:Winking_Christina_by_kirbyslover.jpg|thumb|[[Anatomically correct doll]]s are sometimes used to help disclose abuse.]]

The [[American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]] provides guidelines for what to say to the victim and what to do following the disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aacap.org/cs/root/facts_for_families/responding_to_child_sexual_abuse "Responding To Child Sexual Abuse." ''American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Asa Don Brown has indicated: "A minimization of the trauma and its effects is commonly injected into the picture by parental caregivers to shelter and calm the child. It has been commonly assumed that focusing on children’s issues too long will negatively impact their recovery. Therefore, the parental caregiver teaches the child to mask his or her issues."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Asa Don, "The effects of childhood trauma on adult perception and worldview". (Dissertation) Capella University, 2008, 152 pages. AAT 3297512. {{ISBN|978-0-549-47057-1}}; Publication #3297512.{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many jurisdictions, abuse that is suspected, not necessarily proven, requires reporting to [[child protection]] agencies, such as the [[Child Protection Services]] in the United States. Recommendations for healthcare workers, such as [[primary care provider]]s and [[nurse]]s, who are often suited to encounter suspected abuse are advised to firstly determine the child’s immediate need for safety. A private environment away from suspected abusers is desired for interviewing and examining. Leading statements that can distort the story are avoided. As disclosing abuse can be distressing and sometimes even shameful, reassuring the child that he or she has done the right thing by telling and that they are not bad and that the abuse was not their fault helps in disclosing more information. [[Anatomically correct doll]]s are sometimes used to help explain what happened, although some researchers consider the dolls too explicit and overstimulating, which might contribute to non-abused children behaving with the dolls in one or more ways that suggest they were sexually abused.&lt;ref name="Segal"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Daniel L. Segal, Michel Hersen|title=Diagnostic Interviewing|publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|isbn=1441913203|year=2009|page=455|accessdate=November 23, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LfDRjsei03kC&amp;pg=PA455}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the suspected abusers, it is also recommended to use a nonjudgmental, nonthreatening attitude towards them and to withhold expressing shock, in order to help disclose information.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, S.F.W, Giddens, J.F.G. (2009) Health Assessment for Nursing Practice. St.Louis: Mosby Elsevier, page 506.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
The initial approach to treating a person who has been a victim of sexual abuse is dependent upon several important factors:
*Age at the time of presentation
*Circumstances of presentation for treatment
*Co-morbid conditions

The goal of treatment is not only to treat current mental health issues, and [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] related symptoms, but also to prevent future ones.

===Children and adolescents===
Children often present for treatment in one of several circumstances, including criminal investigations, custody battles, problematic behaviors, and referrals from child welfare agencies.&lt;ref name=NCCAN&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Cynthia Winn |author2=Anthony J. Urquiza |title=Treatment For Abused And Neglected Children: Infancy To Age 18 – User Manual Series |publisher=Diane Pub Co |location= |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-7881-1661-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three major modalities for therapy with children and adolescents are [[family therapy]], [[Group psychotherapy|group therapy]], and [[psychotherapy|individual therapy]]. Which course is used depends on a variety of factors that must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. For instance, treatment of young children generally requires strong parental involvement and can benefit from family therapy. Adolescents tend to be more independent; they can benefit from individual or group therapy. The modality also shifts during the course of treatment, for example group therapy is rarely used in the initial stages, as the subject matter is very personal and/or embarrassing.&lt;ref name=NCCAN/&gt;

Major factors that affect both the pathology and response to treatment include the type and severity of the sexual act, its frequency, the age at which it occurred, and the child’s family of origin.  Roland C. Summit, a medical doctor, defined the different stages the victims of child sexual abuse go through, called [[child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome]]. He suggested that children who are victims of sexual abuse display a range of symptoms that include secrecy, helplessness, entrapment, accommodation, delayed and conflicted disclosure and recantation.&lt;ref name="Summit"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Summit|first=Roland C.|title=The child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|date=January 1983|volume=7|issue=22|pmid=6605796|url=|doi=10.1016/0145-2134(83)90070-4|pages=177–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adults===
Adults who have been sexually abused as children often present for treatment with a secondary mental health issue, which can include substance abuse, [[eating disorders]], [[personality disorders]], depression, and conflict in romantic or interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="Swaby-"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Swaby | first1 = AN. | last2 = Morgan | first2 = KA. | title = The relationship between childhood sexual abuse and sexual dysfunction in Jamaican adults | journal = J Child Sex Abus | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 247–66 | year =  2009| doi =  10.1080/10538710902902679| pmid = 19856732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the approach is to focus on the present problem, rather than the abuse itself. Treatment is highly varied and depends on the person’s specific issues. For instance, a person with a history of sexual abuse suffering from severe depression would be treated for [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. However, there is often an emphasis on [[cognitive restructuring]] due to the deep-seated nature of the trauma. Some newer techniques such as [[eye movement desensitization and reprocessing]] (EMDR) have been shown to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Edmond | first1 = T. | last2 = Rubin | first2 = A. | title = Assessing the long-term effects of EMDR: results from an 18-month follow-up study with adult female survivors of CSA | journal = J Child Sex Abus | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–86 | year = 2004 | doi =  10.1300/J070v13n01_04| pmid = 15353377 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual abuse is associated with many sub-clinical behavioral issues as well, including [[re-victimization]] in the teenage years, a bipolar-like switching between sexual compulsion and shut-down, and [[cognitive distortion|distorted thinking]] on the subject of sexual abuse (for instance, that it is common and happens to everyone).  When first presenting for treatment, the patient can be fully aware of their abuse as an event, but their ''appraisal'' of it is often distorted, such as believing that the event was unremarkable (a form of [[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]]). Frequently, victims do not make the connection between their abuse and their present pathology.

==Prevention==
Child sexual abuse prevention programmes were developed in the United States of America during the 1970s and originally delivered to children. Programmes delivered to parents were developed in the 1980s and took the form of one-off meetings, two to three hours long.&lt;ref name="Babatsikos"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Babatsikos | first=Georgia | title=Parents' knowledge, attitudes and practices about preventing child sexual abuse: a literature review | journal=Child Abuse Review | publisher=Wiley | volume=19 | issue=2 | year=2010 | issn=0952-9136 | doi=10.1002/car.1102 | pages=107–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hébert"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hébert | first=Martine | last2=Lavoie | first2=Francine | last3=Parent | first3=Nathalie | title=An Assessment of Outcomes Following Parents' Participation in a Child Abuse Prevention Program | journal=Violence and Victims | publisher=Springer Publishing Company | volume=17 | issue=3 | date=2002-06-01 | issn=0886-6708 | doi=10.1891/vivi.17.3.355.33664 | pages=355–372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wurtele Moreno Kenny"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wurtele | first=Sandy K. | last2=Moreno | first2=Tasha | last3=Kenny | first3=Maureen C. | title=Evaluation of a Sexual Abuse Prevention Workshop for Parents of Young Children | journal=Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Trauma | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=1 | issue=4 | year=2008 | issn=1936-1521 | doi=10.1080/19361520802505768 | pages=331–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wurtele Kenny 2010 pp. 130–152"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wurtele | first=Sandy K. | last2=Kenny | first2=Maureen C. | title=Partnering with parents to prevent childhood sexual abuse | journal=Child Abuse Review | publisher=Wiley | volume=19 | issue=2 | year=2010 | issn=0952-9136 | doi=10.1002/car.1112 | pages=130–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.nspcc.org.uk/HeritageScripts/Hapi.dll/filetransfer/2018FourStepsToThePreventionOfCSAInTheHome.pdf?CookieCheck=43313.725224213&amp;filename=AA58F75CEDE68892A73FB681FE246B8371684F102152F0AA780A14959D3BCE5767137B3B2A935011CBAEC3068664FF681AA6D2524E357BAB96C006752CCD756759AD77BD1E389823A55CFAAE74B2EE64F46C611AD1724BE1AC500B025490CCB1CD8D9D26B00674E723A731951BB13FBE2976BA14838E6BBB09A4FA52BE735F27D92CBFED7FA6CFFA88BC073F0228EAA69F4D1FE158D846D5D4DD33F8F3466703AC49AD67CE927D87622D067280EF2A231A479B85D0572EF2AABC4480&amp;DataSetName=LIVEDATA|title=Four Steps to the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse in the Home|last=Williams|first=Mike|date=2018|website=NSPCC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.nspcc.org.uk/HeritageScripts/Hapi.dll/filetransfer/2018WorkingWithACommunityToPreventCSAInTheHome.pdf?filename=AA58F75CEDE68892A73FB681FE246B8371684F102152F0AA780A14959D3BCE5767137B3B2A935011CBAEC3068664FF681AA6D2524E357BAB96C006752CCD756759AD77BD1E389823A55CFAAE74B2EE64F46C611AD1724BE1AC500B025490CCB1CD8D9D26B00674E723A731951BB13FBE2976BA14838E6BBB09A4EB52B96A653DDB0BA5CD78B3E4F0B5A317270E32E79B9F7322E26DEE69E8F9DA1AD4D57D6203CA56A4641A004820ECE9E3EB4F712C3FED9F46CEBCE377C14C55CB2FBCFD7942&amp;DataSetName=LIVEDATA|title=Working with a community to prevent child sexual abuse in the home|last=Williams|first=Mike|date=2018|website=NSPCC|access-date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last 15 years, web-based programmes have been developed.

==Offenders==

===Demographics===
Offenders are more likely to be relatives or acquaintances of their victim than strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Fergusson|first1=DM|last2=Lynskey|first2=MT|last3=Horwood|first3=LJ|title=Childhood sexual abuse and psychiatric disorder in young adulthood: I.

More offenders are male than female, though the percentage varies between studies. The percentage of incidents of sexual abuse by female perpetrators that come to the attention of the legal system is usually reported to be between 1% and 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/00224490309552195|last=M.

In U.S. schools, educators who offend range in age from "21 to 75 years old, with an average age of 28".&lt;ref&gt;Shakeshaft, C, "[http://www.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/misconductreview/report.pdf Educator Sexual Misconduct: A Synthesis of the Literature]", U.S. Department of Education, 2004, p.24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to C.E. Dettmeijer-Vermeulen, Dutch national spokeswoman on human traffic and sexual violence against children, in the Netherlands, 3% of the convicted perpetrators are women,&lt;ref name="ontuchtrechter"&gt;http://content1a.omroep.nl/urishieldv2/l27m3d12e148153efb2300572f74d3000000.375fa2fa73455e53cd2a36f78ff00c26/nos/docs/BNRMOntuchtDEF.PDF{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 14.58% of the victims are boys&lt;ref name="ontuchtrechter"/&gt; and "most victims were abused by a family member, friend or acquaintance."&lt;ref name="ontuchtrechter"/&gt; One in six perpetrators is himself underage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2084576-seksueel-misbruik-minderjarigen-vrijwel-altijd-door-bekenden.html|title=Seksueel misbruik minderjarigen vrijwel altijd door bekenden|website=nos.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typology===
Early research in the 1970s and 1980s began to classify offenders based on their motivations and traits. Groth and Birnbaum (1978) categorized child sexual offenders into two groups, "fixated" and "regressed".&lt;ref name="Groth"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01542377 |title=Adult sexual orientation and attraction to underage persons |year=1978 |last1=Groth |first1=A. Nicholas |last2=Birnbaum |first2=H. Jean |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=175–81 |pmid=666571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fixated were described as having a primary attraction to children, whereas regressed had largely maintained relationships with other adults, and were even married. This study also showed that adult [[sexual orientation]] was not related to the sex of the victim targeted, e.g. men who molested boys often had adult relationships with women.&lt;ref name="Groth"/&gt;

Later work (Holmes and Holmes, 2002) expanded on the types of offenders and their psychological profiles.  They are divided as follows:&lt;ref name="holmes"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Holmes | first = Ronald M. |author2=Holmes, Stephen T.  | title =Profiling Violent Crimes: An Investigative Tool  | publisher = Sage Publications, Inc | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | date = 2002-03-12 |  isbn = 978-0-7619-2593-4}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Situational – does not prefer children, but offend under certain conditions.
**''Regressed'' – Typically has relationships with adults, but a stressor causes them to seek children as a substitute.
**''Morally Indiscriminate'' – All-around sexual deviant, who may commit other sexual offenses unrelated to children.
**''Naive/Inadequate'' – Often mentally disabled in some way, finds children less threatening.
*Preferential – has true sexual interest in children.
**''Mysoped'' – Sadistic and violent, target strangers more often than acquaintances.
**''Fixated'' – Little or no activity with own age, described as an "overgrown child".

===Causal factors===
Causal factors of child sex offenders are not known conclusively.&lt;ref name=psychtoday2008&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psychologytoday.com/conditions/pedophilia.html |archive-url=https://arquivo.pt/wayback/20080219104453/http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/pedophilia.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 February 2008 |title=Pedophilia |publisher=Sussex Publishers, LLC |work=Psychology Today |date=7 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of sexual abuse as a child was previously thought to be a strong risk factor, but research does not show a causal relationship, as the vast majority of sexually abused children do not grow up to be adult offenders, nor do the majority of adult offenders report childhood sexual abuse. The US [[Government Accountability Office]] concluded, "the existence of a cycle of sexual abuse was not established." Before 1996, there was greater belief in the theory of a "cycle of violence", because most of the research done was retrospective—abusers were asked if they had experienced past abuse. Even the majority of studies found that most adult sex offenders said they had ''not'' been sexually abused during childhood, but studies varied in terms of their estimates of the percentage of such offenders who had been abused, from 0 to 79 percent. More recent prospective [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] research—studying children with documented cases of sexual abuse over time to determine what percentage become adult offenders—has demonstrated that the cycle of violence theory is not an adequate explanation for why people molest children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cycle of Sexual Abuse: Research Inconclusive About Whether Child Victims Become Adult Abusers|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1996/gg96178.pdf|work= US Government Accountability Office General Government Division United States|author1=E L Rezmovic |author2=D Sloane |author3=D Alexander |author4=B Seltser |author5=T Jessor |year=1996|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Offenders may use [[cognitive distortion]]s to facilitate their offenses, such as [[minimisation (psychology)|minimization]] of the abuse, [[victim blaming]], and [[making excuses|excuses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/107906329500700107 |title=Cognitive Distortions and Affective Deficits in Sex Offenders: A Cognitive Deconstructionist Interpretation1 |year=1995 |last1=Ward |first1=Tony |last2=Hudson |first2=Stephen M. |last3=Marshall |first3=William L. |journal=Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=67–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pedophilia===
{{Main|Pedophilia}}
Pedophilia is a condition in which an adult or older adolescent is primarily or exclusively attracted to prepubescent children, whether the attraction is acted upon or not.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10. § F65.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association (2000). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition text revision), § 302.2&lt;/ref&gt; A person with this attraction is called a ''pedophile''.

In [[Police|law enforcement]], the term ''pedophile'' is sometimes used to describe those accused or convicted of child sexual abuse under [[Minor (law)|sociolegal definitions of ''child'']] (including both prepubescent children and adolescents younger than the local [[age of consent]]);&lt;ref name="ames"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01541928 |title=Legal, social, and biological definitions of pedophilia |year=1990 |last1=Ames |first1=M.

The term ''pedocriminality'' ([[German language|De]]: ''Pädokriminalität''; [[French language|Fr]]: ''pédocriminalité'') is a controversial term which originated in the 1980s and has been used by organisations such as [[UNICEF]], [[UNHRC]], the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;Cathrin Schauer: ''Kinder auf dem Strich: Bericht von der deutsch-tschechischen Grenze''.

One study found that 42% of offenders re-offended (either a sex crime, violent crime, or both) after they were released.

===Child and young adolescent offenders===
{{Main|Child-on-child sexual abuse}}

When a prepubescent child is sexually abused by one or more other children or adolescent youths, and no adult is directly involved, it is defined as [[child-on-child sexual abuse]]. The definition includes any sexual activity between children that occurs without [[consent]], without equality, or due to [[coercion]],&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Shaw JA, Lewis JE, Loeb A, Rosado J, Rodriguez RA |title=Child on child sexual abuse: psychological perspectives |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=1591–600 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11197037 |doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(00)00212-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; whether the offender uses physical force, threats, trickery or [[psychological manipulation|emotional manipulation]] to compel cooperation. When sexual abuse is perpetrated by one sibling upon another, it is known as "[[intersibling abuse]]", a form of [[incest]].&lt;ref name="Caffaroa"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2004.12.001 |title=Treating sibling abuse families |year=2005 |last1=Caffaro |first1=J |last2=Conn-Caffaro |first2=A |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |volume=10 |pages=604–623|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the treatments focus on attempting to change the sexual preference of pedophiles, while others focus on keeping pedophiles from committing child sexual abuse, or on keeping child sexual abusers from committing child sexual abuse again. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), for example, aims to reduce attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that may increase the likelihood of sexual offenses against children. Its content varies widely between therapists, but a typical program might involve training in self-control, social competence and empathy, and use [[cognitive restructuring]] to change views on sex with children. The most common form of this therapy is [[relapse prevention]], where the patient is taught to identify and respond to potentially risky situations based on principles used for treating addictions.&lt;ref name="seto171"&gt;{{cite book |last= Seto |first= Michael |date= 2008|title= Pedophilia and Sexual Offending Against Children |location= Washington, DC |publisher= American Psychological Association|page= 171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys have shown that one fifth to one third of all women reported some sort of childhood sexual experience with a male adult.&lt;ref name=Herman&gt;{{Cite book| last =Herman | first =Judith | title =Father-Daughter Incest  | publisher =Harvard University Press | year =1981  | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts  | page =282  | isbn =0-674-29506-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 1992 survey studying father-daughter incest in Finland reported that of the 9,000 15-year-old high school girls who filled out the questionnaires, of the girls living with their biological fathers, 0.2% reported father-daughter incest experiences; of the girls living with a stepfather, 3.7% reported sexual experiences with him. The reported counts included only father-daughter incest and did not include prevalence of other forms of child sexual abuse.  The survey summary stated, "the feelings of the girls about their incestual experiences are overwhelmingly negative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0145-2134(96)00072-5 |title=The prevalence and context of incest abuse in Finland |year=1996 |last1=Sariola |first1=Heikki |last2=Uutela |first2=Antti |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |volume=20 |issue=9 |pages=843–850}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that prevalence rates are much higher, and that many cases of child abuse are never reported. One study found that professionals failed to report approximately 40% of the child sexual abuse cases they encountered.&lt;ref&gt;Keuhnle, K., Assessing Allegations of Child Sexual Abuse, Professional Resources Press, Sarastota, FL, 1996{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Lawson &amp; Chaffin indicated that many children who were sexually abused were "identified solely by a physical complaint that was later diagnosed as a venereal disease...Only 43% of the children who were diagnosed with venereal disease made a verbal disclosure of sexual abuse during the initial interview."&lt;ref&gt;pg7., In. Keuhnle, K., Assessing Allegations of Child Sexual Abuse, Professional Resources Press, Sarastota, FL, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been found in the epidemiological literature on CSA that there is no identifiable demographic or family characteristic of a child that can be used to bar the prospect that a child has been sexually abused.&lt;ref name="Finklehor-epid"/&gt;

In US schools, according to the [[United States Department of Education]],&lt;ref name="shakeshaft2004"&gt;Shakeshaft, C, "[http://www.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/misconductreview/report.pdf Educator Sexual Misconduct: A Synthesis of the Literature]", U.S. Department of Education, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; "nearly 9.6% of students are targets of educator sexual misconduct sometime during their school career." In studies of student sex abuse by male and female educators, male students were reported as targets in ranges from 23% to 44%.&lt;ref name="shakeshaft2004" /&gt; In U.S. school settings same-sex (female and male) sexual misconduct against students by educators "ranges from 18 to 28% of reported cases, depending on the study"&lt;ref&gt;Shakeshaft, C, "[http://www.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/misconductreview/report.pdf Educator Sexual Misconduct: A Synthesis of the Literature]", U.S. Department of Education, 2004, p26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant underreporting of sexual abuse of boys by both women and men is believed to occur due to sex stereotyping, social denial, the minimization of male victimization, and the relative lack of research on sexual abuse of boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.1992.tb00862.x | last1 = Watkins | first1 = B. | last2 = Bentovim | first2 = A. | year = 1992 | title = The sexual abuse of male children and adolescents: a review of current research | url = http://www.sasian.org/papers/boysngirls.htm | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychiatry | volume = 33 | issue = 10| pages = 197–248 | pmid=1737828}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual victimization of boys by their mothers or other female relatives is especially rarely researched or reported. Sexual abuse of girls by their mothers, and other related and/or unrelated adult females is beginning to be researched and reported despite the highly taboo nature of female–female child sex abuse. In studies where students are asked about sex offenses, they report higher levels of female sex offenders than found in adult reports.&lt;ref&gt;Shakeshaft, C, "[http://www.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/misconductreview/report.pdf Educator Sexual Misconduct: A Synthesis of the Literature]", U.S. Department of Education, 2004, p22.&lt;/ref&gt; This underreporting has been attributed to cultural denial of female-perpetrated child sex abuse,&lt;ref&gt;Denov, Myriam S.  (2004) "Perspectives on Female Sex Offending: A Culture of Denial"&lt;/ref&gt; because "males have been socialized to believe they should be flattered or appreciative of sexual interest from a female."&lt;ref name="Shakeshaft25" /&gt; Journalist Cathy Young writes that under-reporting is contributed to by the difficulty of people, including jurors, in seeing a male as a "true victim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Cathy Young |year=2002 |title=Double Standard |newspaper=The Boston Globe |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/122245371.html?FMT=ABS&amp;date=Jun%203,%202002}} The article may currently be viewed for free on [http://reason.com/archives/2002/06/04/double-standard Reason.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom reported child sex abuse is increasing though this may be due to greater willingness to report.  Police need more resources to deal with it.  Also parents and schools need to give children and adolescents regular advice about how to spot abuse and about the need to report abuse.  Software providers are urged to do more to police their environment and make it safe for children.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/29/estimated-20000-british-men-interested-in-sexually-abusing-children-police-chief-says Estimated 20,000 British men interested in sexually abusing children] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law==

The United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC) is an international [[treaty]] that legally obliges states to protect children's rights.  Articles 34 and 35 of the CRC require states to protect children from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. This includes outlawing the coercion of a child to perform sexual activity, the [[prostitution of children]], and the [[child pornography|exploitation of children in creating pornography]]. States are also required to prevent the abduction, sale, or trafficking of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/k2crc.htm|title=unhchr.ch|website=www.unhchr.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of November 2008, 193 countries are bound by the CRC,&lt;ref name=untreaty&gt;United Nations Treaty Collection.

The Council of Europe has adopted the [[Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] in order to prohibit child sexual abuse that occurs within home or family.

In the [[European Union]], child sexual abuse is subject to a [[Directive (European Union)|directive]].&lt;ref&gt;DIRECTIVE 2011/92/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:335:0001:0014:EN:PDF Eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; This directive deals with several forms of sexual abuse of children, especially [[commercial sexual exploitation of children]].

==History==
Child sexual abuse has gained public attention in the past few decades and has become one of the most high-profile crimes. While sexual use of children by adults has been present throughout history, public interest in prevention has tended to fluctuate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tif.ssrc.org/2012/07/13/placing-childhood-sexual-abuse-in-historical-perspective/|title=Placing childhood sexual abuse in historical perspective – The Immanent Frame|last=Mintz|first=Steven|website=tif.ssrc.org|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, concern centered around children under the age of ten, but over time, advocates have attracted attention toward the sexual abuse of children between the ages of 11 to 17.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Up until the 1930s, the psychological impact of sexual abuse was not emphasized, instead emphasis was placed on the physical harm or the child's reputation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Widespread public awareness of children's sexual abuse did not occur until the 1970s in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conte|first=Jon|date=1994|title=Child Sexual Abuse: Awareness and Backlash|url=https://www.princeton.edu/futureofchildren/publications/docs/04_02_11.pdf|journal=The Future of Children|volume=4|pages=224–225|via=|doi=10.2307/1602532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early writings===
The first published work dedicated specifically to child sexual abuse appeared in France in 1857: ''Medical-Legal Studies of Sexual Assault'' ''(Etude Médico-Légale sur les Attentats aux Mœurs)'', by [[Auguste Ambroise Tardieu]], the noted French pathologist and pioneer of [[forensic medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Masson   | pages = 15–25 |first =  Jeffrey Moussaieff  | authorlink = Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson  | title = Assault on the Truth  | publisher = Farrar Straus  | year = 1984  | location = New York  | isbn = 978-0-374-10642-3  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public concern===
{{Globalize/US|section|date=October 2015}}
Child sexual abuse became a public issue in the 1970s and 1980s. Prior to this point in time, sexual abuse remained rather secretive and socially unspeakable.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Studies on child molestation were nonexistent until the 1920s and the first national estimate of the number of child sexual abuse cases was published in 1948. By 1968 44 out of 50 U.S. states had enacted mandatory laws that required physicians to report cases of suspicious child abuse. Legal action began to become more prevalent in the 1970s with the enactment of the [[Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act]] in 1974 in conjunction with the creation of the National Center for Child Abuse and Neglect. Since the creation of the Child Abuse and Treatment Act, reported child abuse cases have increased dramatically.  Finally, the [[National Abuse Coalition]] was created in 1979 to create pressure in congress to create more sexual abuse laws.

[[Second wave feminism]] brought greater awareness of child sexual abuse and [[violence against women]], and made them public, political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Reavey | first1 = Paula | last2 = Warner | first2 = Sam | contribution = Introduction | editor-last1 = Reavey | editor-first1 = Paula | editor-last2 = Warner | editor-first2 = Sam | title = New feminist stories of child sexual abuse: sexual scripts and dangerous dialogues | page = 2 | publisher = New York Routledge | location = London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780415259446 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=obHkvCPnos0C&amp;pg=PA2 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Valentich | first = Mary | contribution = Feminist theory and social work practice (child sexual abuse) | editor-last = Turner | editor-first = Francis J. | title = Social work treatment: interlocking theoretical approaches | page = 215 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780195394658 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=x_k8Aptn6tEC&amp;pg=PA215 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judith Lewis Herman]], Harvard professor of psychiatry, wrote the first book ever on father-daughter incest when she discovered during her medical residency that a large number of the women she was seeing had been victims of father-daughter incest. Herman notes that her approach to her clinical experience grew out of her involvement in the civil rights movement.&lt;ref name="UCB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people/Herman/herman-con0.html |title=Conversation with History; Dr. Judith Lewis Herman |work=Conversations with History: Institute of International Studies |publisher=UC Berkeley|accessdate=December 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her second book ''Trauma and Recovery'' coined the term [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]] and included child sexual abuse as a cause.&lt;ref name = Herman1997&gt;{{Cite book| title = Trauma and recovery: The aftermath of violence from domestic abuse to political terror | first = JL | last = Herman | year = 1997 | publisher = Basic Books | pages = 119–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Congress passed the [[Child Abuse Victims' Rights Act]], giving children a civil claim in sexual abuse cases. The number of laws created in the 1980s and 1990s began to create greater prosecution and detection of child sexual abusers. During the 1970s a large transition began in the legislature related to child sexual abuse. [[Megan's Law]] which was enacted in 1996 gives the public access to knowledge of sex offenders nationwide.&lt;ref name=wright&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Ph.D Richard G.|title=Sex offender laws : failed policies, new directions|date=2014|publisher=Springer Publishing Co Inc|isbn=9780826196712|pages=50–65|edition=Second edition.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ms75AwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Hastings described these changes in attitudes towards child sexual abuse as "the beginning of one of history's largest social revolutions."&lt;ref&gt;''From Generation to Generation: Understanding Sexual Attraction to Children'', p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor B.J. Cling,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"By the early 21st century, the issue of child sexual abuse has become a legitimate focus of professional attention, while increasingly separated from second wave feminism...As child sexual abuse becomes absorbed into the larger field of interpersonal trauma studies, child sexual abuse studies and intervention strategies have become degendered and largely unaware of their political origins in modern feminism and other vibrant political movements of the 1970s. One may hope that unlike in the past, this rediscovery of child sexual abuse that began in the 70s will not again be followed by collective amnesia. The institutionalization of child maltreatment interventions in federally funded centers, national and international societies, and a host of research studies (in which the United States continues to lead the world) offers grounds for cautious optimism. Nevertheless, as Judith Herman argues cogently, 'The systematic study of psychological trauma...depends on the support of a political movement.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexualized Violence Against Women and Children: A Psychology and Law Perspective|author=B.J. Cling|page=177|year=2004|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=1-59385-061-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Civil lawsuits===
In the United States growing awareness of child sexual abuse has sparked an increasing number of civil [[lawsuits]] for [[monetary damages]] stemming from such incidents.  Increased awareness of child sexual abuse has encouraged more victims to come forward, whereas in the past victims often kept their abuse secret. Some states have enacted specific [[laws]] lengthening the applicable [[statutes of limitations]] so as to allow victims of child sexual abuse to file suit sometimes years after they have reached the age of majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/state-civil-statutes-of-limitations-in-child-sexua.aspx|title=State Civil Statutes of Limitations in Child Sexual Abuse Cases|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such lawsuits can be brought where a person or entity, such as a school, church or youth organization, or daycare was charged with supervising the child but failed to do so with child sexual abuse resulting, making the individual or institution liable.  In the [[Catholic sex abuse cases]] the various [[Roman Catholic]] Diocese in the [[United States]] have paid out approximately $1 billion settling hundreds of such lawsuits since the early 1990s.  There have also been lawsuits involving the American [[Christian right|Religious Right]].  Crimes have allegedly gone unreported and victims were pressured into silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/25/1211671/-The-Church-Child-Sex-Abuse-Scandal-Widens-and-Deepens|title=The Church Child Sex Abuse Scandal Widens and Deepens|work=dailykos.com|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As lawsuits can involve demanding procedures there is a concern that [[children]] or adults who file suit will be re-victimized by defendants through the [[legal process]], much as [[rape]] victims can be re-victimized by the accused in [[criminal]] rape trials.  The child sexual abuse plaintiff's attorney [[Thomas A. Cifarelli]] has written that children involved in the legal system, particularly victims of sexual abuse and molestation, should be afforded certain procedural safeguards to protect them from harassment during the legal process.&lt;ref&gt;Cifarelli, T.A.,''Shielding Minors'', Los Angeles Daily Journal, (October 10, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008 in [[Zambia]] the issue of teacher-student sexual abuse and sexual assault was brought to the attention of the High Court of Zambia where a landmark case decision, with presiding Judge Philip Musonda, awarded $45million Zambian kwacha ($13,000 USD) to the plaintiff, a 13-year-old girl for sexual abuse and rape by her school teacher. This claim was brought against her teacher as a "person of authority" who, as Judge Musonda stated, "had a moral superiority (responsibility) over his students" at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://womennewsnetwork.net/2008/08/11/rapecasezambia-articl804/ "When A Girl Student Stands Up and Wins"], ''Women News Network'' – WNN, August 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2000 World Health Organization – Geneva report, “World Report on Violence and Health (Chap 6 – Sexual Violence)” states, “Action in schools is vital for reducing sexual and other forms of violence. In many countries a sexual relation between a teacher and a pupil is not a serious disciplinary offence and policies on sexual harassment in schools either do not exist or are not implemented. In recent years, though, some countries have introduced laws prohibiting sexual relations between teachers and pupils. Such measures are important in helping eradicate sexual harassment in schools. At the same time, a wider range of actions is also needed, including changes to teacher training and recruitment and reforms of curricula, so as to transform gender relations in schools.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2002/9241545615_chap6_eng.pdf World Health Organization Report on Sexual Violence], 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30316">'''Fictional portrayals of psychopaths''', or '''sociopaths''', are some of the most notorious in film and literature but may only vaguely or partly relate to the concept of [[psychopathy]], which is itself used with varying definitions by [[mental health professional]]s, [[criminologist]]s and others. The character may be identified as a diagnosed/assessed psychopath or sociopath within the fictional work itself, or by its creator when discussing their intentions with the work, which might be distinguished from opinions of audiences or [[critic]]s based only on a character appearing to show traits or behaviors associated with an undefined popular stereotype of psychopathy.

Such characters are often portrayed in an [[exaggeration|exaggerated]] fashion and typically in the role of a [[villain]] or [[antihero]], where the general characteristics of a psychopath are useful to facilitate conflict and danger. Because the definitions and criteria in the [[history of psychopathy]] have varied over the years and continue to change even now, many characters in notable films may have been designed to fall under the category of a psychopath at the time of the film's production or release, but not necessarily in subsequent years. There are several [[stereotypical]] images of psychopathy in both [[Layperson|lay]] and professional accounts which only partly overlap and can involve contradictory traits: the charming [[con artist]], the deranged [[serial killer]], the successful [[Psychopathy in the workplace|corporate psychopath]], or the chronic low-level [[crime|offender]] with [[juvenile delinquency]]. The public concept reflects some combination of fear of the mythical [[bogeyman]], fascination with human [[evil]], and sometimes perhaps [[envy]] of people who might appear to go through life unencumbered by the same levels of [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anguish]] or [[Emotional security|insecurity]].&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Skeem|first=J.

==Early depictions==
In the 19th century the diagnostic categories of [[monomania]] or [[moral insanity]] (the word 'moral' then meant either emotional or ethical) made their way into works of literature, covering numerous eccentricities, obsessions or breakdowns—and sometimes acts of apparently senseless criminality, occasionally violent. This period also saw the rise of [[crime fiction]] such as [[sensation novels]], where often someone in a local community who appeared normal would turn out to be criminally insane, and [[detective novels]], playing on increasing anxieties about the characters of people in the newly expanding and diversifying industrial cities.&lt;ref name=Thesing&gt;{{cite book |title=A companion to the Victorian novel |author=Patrick Brantlinger, William B. Thesing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PMWWh6yu3oEC |page=76 &amp; 236|isbn= 0-631-22064-X |year=2002 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'psychopath' came into use in the late 19th century (as did the term it would often be confused with, [[psychotic]]), and also spanned a very wide range of conditions ([[etymologically]] and originally equivalent to 'mentally ill'). Nevertheless, an early rise to prominence followed its use in a Russian trial between 1883 and 1885 concerning a child murder, contributing to the release of a probable false confessor while the original suspect was found guilty. 'Psychopaths' began to appear in [[vaudeville]]s, ditties (songs) and press articles. The psychopathy defense was reported internationally as having enabled a remorseless female child killer to go free, a usage still quoted in dictionaries today.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] 2011: Psychopath: 1885 Pall Mall G. 21 Jan.

[[Degeneration|'Degenerates']] were also depicted in popular fiction of the 19th through to mid 20th century, sometimes in similar ways to the modern usages of the concept of psychopaths, sometimes being cited as a cause of psychopathy. The concept fell into disrepute due partly to its use by the Nazis to justify eradicating their opposition.&lt;ref name=Jalava&gt;[http://summit.sfu.ca/item/8120 Science of conscience: Metaphysics, morality, and rhetoric in psychopathy research] Jarkko Jalava, 2007, PhD at Simon Fraser University, then Professor at Okanagan College, Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==
The meaning gradually narrowed, initially as 'psychopathic inferiors' covering all of what today might be called [[personality disorders]] and various other conditions, then intertwining with the terminology of the 'sociopath' (and eventually [[antisocial personality disorder]]), though psychopathy remained variously defined in both broad and narrow ways.

Early representations of psychopaths in film were often caricatured as sadistic, unpredictable, sexually depraved, and emotionally unstable ([[mania|manic]]) characters with a compulsion to engage in random violence and destruction, usually with a series of bizarre mannerisms such as giggling, laughing, or facial [[tics]]. Up until the late 1950s, cinematic conventions usually relegated the psychopath to roles of genre villains such as gangsters, [[mad scientists]], [[supervillains]], and many types of generic criminals. Examples of this type are [[Pinkie Brown]] ([[Richard Attenborough]]) in ''[[Brighton Rock (1947 film)|Brighton Rock]]'', Tommy Udo ([[Richard Widmark]]) in ''[[Kiss of Death (1947 film)|Kiss of Death]]'', Cody Jarrett ([[James Cagney]]) in ''[[White Heat (film)|White Heat]]'', and [[Tony Camonte|Antonio 'Tony' Camonte]] ([[Paul Muni]]) in the 1932 version of ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]''. [[Homosexuals]] were also referred to as psychopaths under the broad definition then in use; the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in the first [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] in 1952 would list it under 'sociopathic personality disturbance'.

One exceptional depiction in this period was the character of child murderer Hans Beckert ([[Peter Lorre]]) in the 1931 [[Fritz Lang]] film ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]''. Lorre portrays Beckert as an outwardly unremarkable man tormented by a compulsion to ritualistically murder children. A German film (allegedly based on the real life [[serial killer]] [[Peter Kürten]]), it was released in America in 1933 and has been seen as indicative of a turning point in American media depictions of psychopaths. Until the 1930s psychiatrists typically applied the diagnosis to unemployed males or 'hypersexual' women, but several psychiatric, cultural and economic trends, together with [[sex crime]] panics, converged to transform the popular psychopath into a violent, male, sexual deviant or criminal—a threat to innocence, [[gender role]]s and the [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1908506?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102561687811 "Uncontrolled Desires": The Response to the Sexual Psychopath, 1920-1960] Estelle B. Freedman, The Journal of American History, Vol. 74, No. 1 (Jun., 1987), pp. 83-106. Also reproduced in [https://books.google.com/books?id=5jTjfFo42E8C Passion and Power: Sexuality in History (from Pg 199)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ostap Bender]] character from novels [[The Twelve Chairs]] and [[The Little Golden Calf]] by Soviet authors [[Ilf and Petrov]] is also considered a portrait of a charming psychopath.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.b17.ru/blog/11662/ Be cautious - socially adapted psychopath, damned attractive man]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tanja-tank.livejournal.com/34480.html sociopaths and narcissists in movies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennie Small from [[Of Mice and Men]], who is mentally retarded, has been described as also lacking a conscience or moral sense, a common definition of a [[psychopath]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/o/of-mice-and-men/character-analysis/lennie-small&lt;/ref&gt; His inability to stay out of trouble is often attributed to this.

==Mid 20th century==
One of the earliest real life cases which had a pervasive influence on American movies was that of [[Ed Gein]], arrested in 1957. A farmer who had resided with his mother until her death, he had then killed two women and dug up female bodies from the local [[cemetery]], making various items out of their skin. Rumours spread that he was also a [[necrophiliac]], [[cannibal]] or [[transvestite]], though these appear to have been unsupported other than by brief affirmations from Gein to [[leading questions]] by interrogators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_ZDUR7H_QMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Deviant] Harold Schechter, 1998, Pg 192, 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertcdaniels.com/ed_gein.htm#_ftn2 Ed Gein: the Cannibal Myth Exposed]&lt;/ref&gt; Gein was found mentally ill and legally insane before trial, deemed to have had [[schizophrenia]] (psychosis including [[delusions]] and [[hallucinations]]) for at least 12 years, though at least one media psychiatrist dubbed him instead a 'sexual psychopath'.&lt;ref&gt;Gonyea, Floyd.

January 7, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bloch]], a prolific pulp horror author, says his 1959 novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' was based on the Gein murders and the idea of an apparently sane person in a local community committing heinous crimes, but not necessarily on Gein himself, despite numerous similarities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediageeknetwork.com/psycho-exclusive-an-interview-with-author-robert-bloch/ PSYCHO EXCLUSIVE: An Interview With Author Robert Bloch] By Ed Gross, Media Geek Network, November 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The villain, [[Norman Bates]], is portrayed as an outwardly unremarkable man who murders a woman while under the control of an [[disassociative identity disorder|alternate personality]] that takes the form of [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his domineering mother]], who he himself murdered. Both the novel and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film adaptation]] were influences on the popular media portrayal of psychopaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penguin-readers.com/pdf/downloads/pr/teachers-notes/9781405879286.pdf Teacher's Notes: Psycho] Penguin 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC43folder/EdGein.html Ed Gein and the figure of the transgendered serial killer] by K.E. Sullivan. from Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media, no. 43, July 2000, pp. 38-47&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the book nor film elaborates on the term 'psycho', though it is commonly taken to refer to either psychotic or psychopath. At the end of the film, a psychiatrist describes Bates as having a split personality. [[Multiple personality disorder]] was at that time very popular (cf 1957 movie ''[[The Three Faces of Eve]]'') and is to this day commonly confused with [[schizophrenia]]. Bloch later wrote a script for the 1966 film ''[[The Psychopath]]'', the original working title for which was "Schizo".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/The-Psychopath_1966 The Psychopath – 1966: Plot Synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt;

A different thread within fictional portrayals of psychopathy continued to focus on rebelliously antisocial characters. The title of the 1955 film ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', starring [[James Dean]], came from a 1944 book of the same name detailing the [[hypnosis|hypno]]-[[Psychoanalysis|analysis]] of a diagnosed psychopath. In the book, psychiatrist [[Robert M. Lindner]] also discussed psychopaths in general as pointlessly selfish individuals who appear unable to accept society's rules. In [[Ken Kesey]]'s 1962 novel ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', [[Randle McMurphy]], after being admitted to a mental institution, is repeatedly referred to by the authorities, other patients and himself as a possible or definite psychopath. He reads from his record: "repeated outbreaks of passion that suggest the possible diagnosis of psychopath", and adds that a doctor told him it means "I fight and fuh-pardon me, ladies-means I am he put it overzealous in my sexual relations." The current doctor then reads out the note: "Don't overlook the possibility that this man might be feigning psychosis".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shmoop.com/one-flew-over-cuckoos-nest/madness-quotes.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the script for the popular [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|film adaptation]] in 1975, only the latter is retained and the term psychopath is never used. Ironically, the main authority figure in the hospital—the cold, [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Nurse Ratched]]—was later described as a psychopath under later understandings of the term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LBIjsk-2ok4C The Psychopath in Film] 1999 By Wayne Wilson. Pg 68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late 20th century==
The 1973 film ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' involved two lead characters based loosely on  [[Charles Starkweather]] and [[Caril Ann Fugate]]. While the male lead Kit ([[Martin Sheen]]) is sometimes described as a psychopath or sociopath, psychologist [[Robert D. Hare]], a leading proponent of the assessment of psychopathy, has identified Holly ([[Sissy Spacek]]) as exemplifying his concept of a psychopath due to her poor emotional sense of the meaning of events and her attempted mask of normality. However, writer and director [[Terrence Malick]] has said he considered Kit's shallow, bitter insensitivity to be a result of suffering and neglect growing up in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], and 15-year-old Holly, though immature and mis-estimating her audience, to be a quite typical [[Southern United States|Southern]] girl wanting to help narrate and come off well but still give the hard facts, and not dwell on herself or on personal tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xfIEVtzj52YC Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us] Robert D. Hare, Guilford Press, 1993/2011. Pg 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jSNCB6yCJPoC Terrence Malick] Lloyd Michaels, University of Illinois Press, 2009. Pg 103&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing media focus of serial killers in the late 20th century, fueled by cases such as [[John Wayne Gacy]] (1978), [[Ted Bundy]] (1978) and [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] (1991), lent an additional momentum to the way psychopathy was both perceived and portrayed in film and literature, sometimes incorporating a hybrid of traditional psychopaths from early film and late-19th century literature with the high-functioning behaviors detected in some serial killers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc3228/m2/1/high_res_d/thesis.pdf Serial Killing Myths Versus Reality: A Content Analysis of Serial Killer Movies Made Between 1980 and 2001] Sarah Scott McCready, Masters Thesis, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.1995.1801_87.x | volume=18 | issue=1 | title=Consuming Cannibals: Psychopathic Killers as Archetypes and Cultural Icons | year=1995 | journal=The Journal of American Culture | pages=87–96 | last1 = Grixti | first1 = Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychiatrist and [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] serial killer [[Dr. Hannibal Lecter]], most notably portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]] in the [[Academy Award]]-winning 1991 film ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', is perhaps the most infamous fictional psychopath of the 20th century. Lecter is intelligent and sophisticated (whereas psychopathy is generally associated with lower than average verbal [[intelligence]]&lt;ref name="LecterIntelligence"&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeLisi|first=Matt|author2=Vaughn, Michael G.|author3=Beaver, Kevin M.|author4=Wright, John Paul|title=The Hannibal Lecter Myth: Psychopathy and Verbal Intelligence in the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study|journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment|volume=32|issue=2|pages=169–177|doi=10.1007/s10862-009-9147-z|url=http://www.soc.iastate.edu/staff/delisi/Hannibal%20Lecter%20PDF.pdf|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and his disarming charisma and wit disguise his true nature as a serial killer. He spends most of the film in a cell, taunting [[Clarice Starling]] with clues to the identity of another serial killer, [[Buffalo Bill (The Silence of the Lambs)|Buffalo Bill]], in exchange for intimate details of Starling's troubled childhood. Lecter first appeared in [[Thomas Harris]]'  1981 novel ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'', in which he is characterized as not fitting any known psychological profile. In the film adaptation of ''The Silence of the Lambs'', he is referred to as a "pure psychopath".&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'' and its first film adaptation, ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'', FBI profiler [[Will Graham (fictional character)|Will Graham]] suggests that psychologists "say he's a sociopath" because they "don't know what else to call him". Shortly afterwards in ''Red Dragon'', Lecter's jailer [[Frederick Chilton]] says "...we thought he might provide us with a singular opportunity to study a pure sociopath...As it turned out, I don't think we're any closer to understanding him now than the day he came in." In the script for the film version of ''The Silence of the Lambs'', the same character calls Lecter a "pure psychopath". In the novel of the same name, FBI agent [[Jack Crawford (character)|Jack Crawford]] tells Starling "I'm waist-deep in inaccessible patient evaluations of Dr. Lecter and they're all different" and Chilton later tells Starling "A pure sociopath, that's obviously what he is. But he's impenetrable, much too sophisticated for the standard tests."&lt;/ref&gt; In the later novels ''[[Hannibal (Harris novel)|Hannibal]]'' and ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'', Lecter's psychopathy is portrayed as the result of seeing his sister Mischa murdered and cannibalized during [[World War II]]. In 2013 Harris revealed that he originally based the Lecter character on Alfredo Ballí Trevino, a Mexican physician who had killed and dismembered his [[homosexual]] lover, in what was called a [[crime of passion]] over a financial dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/495908/20130731/hannibal-lecter-gay-mexican-doctor-alfredo-ball.htm Real Hannibal Lecter was Murderous Gay Mexican Doctor Alfredo Ballí Treviño] Umberto Bacchi, IB Times, July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latintimes.com/articles/6867/20130730/real-hannibal-lecter-gay-mexican-doctor-alfredo-balli-trevino-inspiration-thomas-harris-silence-lambs-25-anniversary.htm Who Was The Real Hannibal Lecter?] Valdez, Latin Times, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel ''[[American Psycho]]'' tells the story of [[Patrick Bateman]], a [[yuppie]] serial killer working on [[Wall Street]] in the 1980s. It was made into a [[American Psycho (film)|film]] in 2000. Author [[Bret Easton Ellis]] has told interviewers that the book is a satire on shallow [[consumerist]] lifestyles, but also that the writing of the violent scenes was based on fictional horror and FBI material on serial killers, along with how he imagined "a psychotic who worked on Wall Street" would describe such incidents. Some commentary, including in scientific journals, has suggested the Bateman character appears to be a psychopath. However, Bateman also exhibits signs of psychosis such as hallucinations, and as such appears to be an [[unreliable narrator]]; it is left ambiguous whether Bateman is actually a serial killer, or is merely hallucinating about committing murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6127/the-art-of-fiction-no-216-bret-easton-ellis Bret Easton Ellis, The Art of Fiction]  No. 216.

In the 1993 book ''[[Girl, Interrupted]]'' and its 1999 [[Girl, Interrupted (film)|film adaptation]], the character of Lisa (played by [[Angelina Jolie]] in the film) is a rebellious, antisocial young woman who is diagnosed as a sociopath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://college.cengage.com/psychology/resources/students/screen/screen_20000110.html Girl, Interrupted—Cuckoo's Nest Redux] By Elaine Cassel, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is left ambiguous whether that diagnosis is accurate.

The 1996 film ''[[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]]'' depicts a suspected murderer who appears to suffer from [[multiple personality disorder]], who at the end reveals that he has been faking the disorder. In the original novel by [[William Diehl]], the psychiatrist Molly Arrington and others repeatedly explain psychopathy and psychosis as if they are the same, inherently antisocial, condition.

''[[Harry Potter]]'' author [[J. K. Rowling]] has described [[Lord Voldemort]], the series' main villain, as "a raging psychopath, devoid of the normal human responses to other people's suffering, and there ARE people like that in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0900-ew-jensen.htm|author=Jensen, Jeff. |title='Fire' Storm |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=7 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
Numerous characters in television shows are informally described as psychopaths by the [[actors]] who play the parts. Examples include [[Natalie Buxton]] in ''[[Bad Girls (TV series)|Bad Girls]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.badgirls.co.uk/library/int-s6-db.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sean Slater]] and [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] in ''[[EastEnders]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bettingpress.com/category/Entertainment/Who-killed-Archie-Mitchell-update--Sean-Slater-now-favourite-in-Eastenders-betting-201002160062/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a373916/eastenders-michael-moon-is-a-psychopath-says-steve-john-shepherd.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dexter Morgan]] in the American show ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]].''&lt;ref&gt;http://darklydexter.com/articles/michael-c-hall-and-kevin-dutton-discuss-about-psychopathy/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/jodie-comer-meet-killing-eves-pink-dressed-psychopathic-breakout-star-w520872&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] from the British TV soap ''[[Coronation Street]]'', is also known for having a serious personality disorder. His character is famous for presenting several tendencies of a sociopathic personality including, manipulation, lying, and aggression. He has served time in prison and often blames his mother for his traumatic childhood,  His character has matured over the years however, the mask tends to slip from time to time and he returns to his darker side, most recently when he helped hide a dead body with a terrifying, cold-hearted attitude.

[[Gregory House|Dr. Gregory House]], the title character in the FOX medical-thriller ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' is referred to as a sociopath multiple times by several characters throughout the course of the show.

[[Sherlock Holmes]], the lead character in the BBC series ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', is referred to as a psychopath multiple times throughout the course of the show; in response to these claims, Holmes describes himself as a "high-functioning sociopath". He has also been described as having [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/magazine/06diagnosis-t.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetclaire.org/quotes/sherlock/series-two/the-hounds-of-baskerville/ |title=Sherlock "The Hounds of Baskerville" (Episode 2.2) &amp;#124; Planet Claire Quotes |publisher=Planetclaire.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dan Wells (author)|Dan Wells]] novel ''[[I Am Not a Serial Killer]]'' and its sequels, ''[[Mr. Monster]]'' and ''[[I Don't Want To Kill You]]'', are narrated by John Wayne Cleaver, a teenaged diagnosed sociopath who lives by a rigid code of behavior in order to avoid becoming a serial killer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fearfulsymmetry.net/ Author's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

One Chicago academic has argued in a review of TV trends that the contemporary fantasy of sociopathy/psychopathy is of someone whose emotional disconnection from others in society, rather than being the hindrance that it can represent in real clinical cases, enables them to be an amazingly successful manipulator due to a breakdown in the [[social contract]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenewinquiry.com/features/why-we-love-sociopaths/ Why We Love Sociopaths]. Adam Kotsko, New Inquiry, April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary advice on writing psychopathic/sociopathic characters suggests that lack of a conscience and lack of empathy are always the chief characteristics, along with an ability to fool others, while the type of selfish antisocial behavior, and any secondary characteristics, can vary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5fPEQl7I5H0C&amp; Bullies, Bastards And Bitches: How To Write The Bad Guys Of Fiction]. Jessica Morrell. 2008. Chapter 7: Sociopaths: Ice in their Veins&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the video console game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' was released with numerous references to psychopaths and sociopaths, including reports from a fictional psychiatrist. One of the lead characters, Trevor, is described both psychopathic and psychotic; the voice actor who played the part says he based his performance on [[Tom Hardy]]'s portrayal of [[Charles Bronson (prisoner)|Charles Bronson]] in the film ''[[Bronson (film)|Bronson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/an-interview-with-steven-ogg-the-voice-of-gta-vs-trevor An Interview With Steven Ogg, The Voice Of "GTA V’s" Trevor].

[[Jacob M. Appel]]'s ''The Mask of Sanity'' depicts a high-functioning sociopath, Jeremy Balint, who gains fame as a cardiologist while killing strangers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-57962-495-8 Publisher's Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forewordreviews.com/reviews/the-mask-of-sanity/ Review by Jeffrey Fleischer]&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Fourth-wave feminism''' is an approach to feminism that began around 2012 and is associated with the belief that all humans are [[Social equality|equal]]. It heavily focuses on [[intersectionality]], pushing for greater [[empowerment]] of [[Marginalization|traditionally marginalized groups]] in society, including women and girls&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psa.ac.uk/insight-plus/feminism-fourth-wave|title=Feminism: A fourth wave? {{!}} The Political Studies Association (PSA)|website=Feminism: A fourth wave? {{!}} The Political Studies Association (PSA)|language=en|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fourth-wave feminists advocate for greater representation of these groups in politics and business, and argues that we would have a more equitable society when we incorporate the perspectives of all citizens. Whereas earlier feminists fought for and earned women opportunities for [[liberation]], [[individualism]], and [[social mobility]], the new wave furthers the agenda by calling for justice against [[Sexual assault|assault]] and [[Sexual harassment|harassment]], [[equal pay for equal work]], and the freedom to make individual choices over own bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Ruth|last2=Cree|first2=Viviene E.|date=2014-02-21|title=What does the ‘Fourth Wave’ Mean for Teaching Feminism in Twenty-First Century Social Work?|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02615479.2014.885007?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Social Work Education|language=en|volume=33|issue=7|pages=930–943|doi=10.1080/02615479.2014.885007|issn=0261-5479}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fourth-wave feminists collaborate to publicly speak against [[Abuse of power|abusers of power]] and to provide [[Equal opportunity|opportunities]] for girls and women to be properly recognized and compensated for who they are and what they offer. In addition to advocating for women's issues, feminists point out that boys and men should have greater opportunities to be engaged parents to their children, to express their emotions and feelings freely, and to present themselves and their individualities in the ways they wish&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Chamberlain|first=Prudence|title=Introduction|date=2017|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-53682-8_1|work=The Feminist Fourth Wave|pages=1–19|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-53682-8_1|isbn=9783319536811|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Fourth-wave feminism'''  is the resurgence of interest in [[feminism]] that began around 2012 and is associated with the use of [[social media]].&lt;ref name=4thWave-Guardian20131210/&gt; According to feminist scholar [[Prudence Chamberlain]], the focus of the fourth wave is justice for women, particularly opposition to [[sexual harassment]] and [[violence against women]]. Its essence, she writes, is "incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist".{{sfn|Chamberlain|2017|p=115}}

Fourth-wave feminism is "defined by technology", according to [[Kira Cochrane]], and characterized particularly by the use of [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]], [[Tumblr]], and blogs such as [[Feministing]] to challenge [[misogyny]].&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|authorlink=Kira Cochrane|title=The Fourth Wave of Feminism: Meet the Rebel Women|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15fob-q4-t.html|title=The Blogger and Author on the Life of Women Online|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|date=13 November 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/news/feminisms-fourth-wave-is-the-shitlist/|title=Feminism's Fourth Wave is the Shitlist|last=Zerbisias|first=Antonia|date=16 September 2015|website=NOW Toronto|publisher=|access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cochrane|2013}}

Issues that fourth-wave feminists focus on include [[street harassment|street]] and [[workplace harassment]], [[campus sexual assault]] and [[rape culture]]. Several scandals have galvanized the movement, including the [[2012 Delhi gang rape|Delhi gang rape]] (2012), [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|Jimmy Savile allegations]] (2012), [[Bill Cosby sexual assault cases]] (2014), [[2014 Isla Vista killings|Isla Vista killings]] (2014), [[trial of Jian Ghomeshi]] (2016), [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|Harvey Weinstein allegations]] (2017) and subsequent [[Me Too movement]] and [[Weinstein effect]], and the [[2017 Westminster sexual scandals|Westminster sexual scandals]] (2017).&lt;ref&gt;For Cosby, Ghomeshi, #MeToo and fourth wave, see Matheson, Kelsey (17 October 2017). [http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/kelsey-matheson/you-said-metoo-now-what-are-we-going-to-do-about-it_a_23246129/ "You Said #MeToo. Now What Are We Going To Do About It?"], ''The Huffington Post''.{{pb}}

Examples of fourth-wave feminist campaigns include the [[Everyday Sexism Project]], [[Ni una menos]], [[No More Page 3]], [[Stop Bild Sexism]], ''[[Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)|Mattress Performance]]'', ''[[10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman]]'', [[YesAllWomen|#YesAllWomen]], [[Free_the_Nipple_(campaign)|Free the Nipple]], [[One Billion Rising]], the [[2017 Women's March]], the [[2018 Women's March]], the [[Me Too movement]], and [[Time's Up (movement)|Time's Up]]. In December 2017, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine chose several prominent female activists involved in the #MeToo movement, dubbed "the silence breakers", as [[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]].&lt;ref name=Zacharek6Dec2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redden, Molly, and agencies (6 December 2017).

== History ==
{{further|First-wave feminism|Second-wave feminism|Third-wave feminism}}
{{Feminism sidebar|expanded=history}}
Journalist [[Pythia Peay]] argued for the existence of a fourth wave as early as 2005, one focusing on social justice and civil rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Peay | first= Pythia | title =Feminism's Fourth Wave | work =[[Utne Reader]] | issue = 128 | year = 2005 | pages = 59–60 | url = http://www.utne.com/community/feminisms-fourth-wave.aspx | location = Topeka, Kansas | publisher = Ogden Publications | access-date = 7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011 [[Jennifer Baumgardner]] dated the start of the fourth wave to 2008.{{sfn|Baumgardner|2011|p=250}} [[Twitter]], the social network most popular with the 18–29 age group, was created in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Brodzky|first=Brandon|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141118182103-28964915-social-media-user-statistics-age-demographics-for-2014|title=Social Media User Statistics &amp; Age Demographics for 2014|date=18 November 2014|website=LinkedIn Pulse|access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; making feminism more accessible and giving rise to "hashtag feminism".{{sfn|Bennett|2014}} Cochrane wrote in 2013 that many of the fourth-wave's leaders were teenagers or in their 20s.&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt;

By 2013 it was obvious that a new wave of feminist protests was taking place. When [[Wendy Davis (politician)|Wendy Davis]] staged her 13-hour [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]] in Texas in 2013 to prevent an abortion bill from passing, women showed their support by rallying around the [[Texas State Capitol]], and those who couldn't be there physically used the #StandWithWendy. Similarly, women protested the often sexist questions directed at female celebrities by tweeting the hashtag #askhermore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Chittal|first=Nisha|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/how-social-media-changing-the-feminist-movement|title=How Social Media is Changing the Feminist Movement|website=MSNBC|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas==
Cochrane describes the fourth wave as focusing on sexual harassment (including street harassment), workplace discrimination, [[body shaming]], sexist imagery in the media, online misogyny, assault on public transport, and [[intersectionality]], relying on social media for communication and online petitioning for organizing.&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abrahams|first1=Jessica|title=Everything you wanted to know about fourth wave feminism—but were afraid to ask|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/everything-wanted-know-fourth-wave-feminism|work=Prospect|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bcrw.barnard.edu/wp-content/nfs/reports/NFS8-FemFuture-Online-Revolution-Report-April-15-2013.pdf|title=#FemFuture: Online Revolution|last1=Martin|first1=Courtney E.|last2=Valenti|first2=Vanessa|publisher=Barnard Centre for Research on Women|date=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events and organizations included the [[Everyday Sexism Project]], [[Kat Banyard|UK Feminista]], [[Reclaim the Night]], [[One Billion Rising]], and "[[a Lose the Lads' mags protest]]".&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt;

Books associated with the new wave include ''[[Men Explain Things to Me]]'' (2014) by [[Rebecca Solnit]] (which gave rise to the term ''[[mansplaining]]''); ''The Vagenda'' (2014) by [[Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett]] and [[Holly Baxter]] (based on their online feminist magazine, ''[[The Vagenda]]'', launched in 2012); ''Sex Object: A Memoir'' (2016) by [[Jessica Valenti]]; and ''Everyday Sexism'' (2016) by [[Laura Bates]] (based on Bates' Everyday Sexism Project).{{sfn|Bates|2014}} Cosslett's and Baxter's book aims to debunk the stereotypes of femininity promoted by the mainstream women's press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vagendamagazine.com/about/|title=Letter from the Editor|publisher=The Vagenda|date=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates, a British feminist writer, created the Everyday Sexism Project on 16 April 2012 as an online forum where women could post their experiences of everyday harassment.&lt;ref name=Aitkenhead24Jan2016&gt;{{cite news |last=Aitkenhead |first=Decca |author-link=Decca Aitkenhead |title=Laura Bates Interview: 'Two Years Ago, I Didn't Know What Feminism Meant' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/laura-bates-interview-everyday-sexism |newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
One criticism of fourth-wave feminism is that it depends on technology. As [[Ragna Rök Jóns]] argued in ''Bluestockings Magazine'' in 2013, "[t]he key problem that this '4th Wave' will face will be the disproportionate access to and ownership of digital media devices." The fourth wave is left with the "inherent [[classism]] and [[ableism]]" created by giving the biggest voice to those who can afford and use technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bluestockingsmag.com/2013/08/19/is-the-4th-wave-of-feminism-digital/|title=Is the '4th Wave' of Feminism Digital?|last=Jóns|first=Ragna Rök|website=Bluestockings Magazine|date=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued that when people participate in Twitter activism, they may not feel the need to do anything else to help the effort. In an article for [[Newuniversity.org]], Alex Guardado argues that after contributing their say, people just "continue on with their day, liking other posts or retweeting". Some may think of themselves as activists while never bothering to attend a single rally or extend their message beyond their Twitter fan base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newuniversity.org/2015/03/opinion/hashtag-activism-the-benefits-and-limitations-of-activism/|title=Hashtag Activism: The Benefits and Limitations of #Activism |last=Guardado|first=Alex|date=3 March 2015|work=New University|publisher= University of California, Irvine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jennifer Simpkins]] of ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'' argued in 2014 that fourth-wave feminism had created a hostile, ''[[Mean Girls]]''–like atmosphere, in which women are more likely to tear each other down. "I've actually never once been belittled and attacked by a man for believing in the cause of feminism," she states, "but women are just about lining up to take a whack at the shoddy piñata of my personal tastes and opinions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Simpkins |first=Jennifer |date=20 January 2014 |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jennifer-simpkins/feminism-fourth-wave-became-mean-girls_b_4616597.html|title='You Can't Sit with Us!' – How Fourth-Wave Feminism Became 'Mean Girls'|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gabriel Arturo Garza Hoth''' (born [[Mexico]], ?) also known as "The Black Widower", was a [[Mexicans|Mexican]] [[serial killer]] active between 1991 and 1998 in [[Mexico City]]. He collected life insurance payments on his wife and lovers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newton |first=Michael |title=The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwNVbOcTncwC&amp;pg=PA346&amp;dq=gabriel+garza+hoth&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BBF0UoboJKKsjALeloGIAw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA |location=New York, USA |publisher=Facts On File, Inc. |isbn=0-8160-6195-5 |accessdate=November 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; gaining a total of 500,000 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |date=September 1, 2000 |title=Las ganancias del Viudo Negro |url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2000/01/09/e-05802d.htm |newspaper=El Clarín |location=Mexico |publisher= |accessdate=November 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first victim was his first wife, named Soledad Valdez, who had a heart attack and died in 1991, but the doctors believed that maybe she had been poisoned.

He was captured in 1998 and extradited to Mexico, where he was condemned to life in prison.

{{Generations Sidebar}}

'''Generation X''' or '''Gen X''' is the [[demography|demographic]] [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] following the [[baby boomers]] and preceding the [[Millennials]].  There are no precise dates for when Generation X starts or ends.  Demographers and researchers typically use birth years ranging from the early-to-mid 1960s to the early 1980s.

Members of Generation X were children during a time of shifting societal values and as children were sometimes called the "[[latchkey kid|latchkey]] generation", due to reduced adult supervision as children compared to previous generations, a result of increasing [[divorce]] rates and increased maternal participation in the workforce, prior to widespread availability of childcare options outside the home. As adolescents and young adults, they were dubbed the "[[MTV Generation]]" (a reference to the [[MTV|music video channel of the same name]]). In the 1990s they were sometimes characterized as [[slackers]], [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] and disaffected.  Some of the cultural influences on Gen X youth were the musical genres of [[grunge]] and [[hip hop music]], and [[indie film]]s. In midlife, research describes them as active, happy, and achieving a [[work–life balance]]. The cohort has been credited with [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] tendencies.

==Origin of term==
[[File:Douglas Coupland Photo of Author.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|200px|[[Douglas Coupland]] popularized the term "Generation X" in his 1991 novel ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture]]''.]]
The term "Generation X" has been used at various times throughout history to describe alienated youth. In the 1950s, Hungarian photographer [[Robert Capa]] used Generation X as the title for a photo-essay about young men and women growing up immediately following [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v10ZUR_Ca3EC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=generation+x+holiday&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=generation%20x%20holiday GenXegesis: essays on alternative youth (sub)culture By John McAllister Ulrich, Andrea L. Harris] p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, English musician [[Billy Idol]] used the moniker as the name for [[Generation X (band)|a punk rock band]],&lt;ref name="Adweek"/&gt; based on the title of a [[Generation X (1965 book)|1965 book on popular youth culture]] by two British journalists, Jane Deverson and Charles Hamblett.&lt;ref name="Gen X"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26339959|title=The original Generation X|date=2014-03-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term acquired its modern definition after the release of ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture]]'', a 1991 novel written by Canadian author [[Douglas Coupland]]. Demographer [[Neil Howe]] noted the delay in naming this demographic cohort saying, "Over 30 years after their birthday, they didn't have a name. I think that's germane." Previously, the cohort had been referred to as Post-Boomers, Baby Busters, New [[Lost Generation]], [[latchkey kid]]s, [[MTV Generation]], and the 13th Generation (the 13th generation since [[American independence]]).&lt;ref name="Adweek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MetLife2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Demographic Profile - America's Gen X|url=https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/Profiles/mmi-gen-x-demographic-profile.pdf|accessdate=21 May 2016|publisher=MetLife}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coupland, Doug. "[http://joeclark.org/dossiers/GenerationX.pdf Generation X]."

Demographer [[Strauss–Howe generational theory|William Strauss]] observed that Coupland applied the term to older members of the cohort born between 1961 and 1964, who were sometimes told by demographers that they were [[baby boomers]], but who did not feel like boomers. Strauss also noted that around the time Coupland's 1991 novel was published the symbol "X" was prominent in popular culture, as the film ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]'' was released in 1992, and that the name "Generation X" ended up sticking. The "X" refers to an unknown variable or to a desire not to be defined.&lt;ref name="MetLife2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Neil Howe &amp; William Strauss discuss the Silent Generation on Chuck Underwood's Generations|date=2001|pages=49:00|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_owfM7CiCA#t=202.342609854}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ralphelson|first1=Samantha|title=From GIs To Gen Z (Or Is It iGen?): How Generations Get Nicknames|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/06/349316543/don-t-label-me-origins-of-generational-names-and-why-we-use-them|accessdate=21 May 2016|publisher=NPR|date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birth dates ==

Generation X is the demographic cohort following the [[post–World War II baby boom]], representing a generational change from the [[baby boomers]], but there is debate over what this means because the end-date of the baby-boomer generation is disputed. Research from [[MetLife]], examining the boomers, split their cohort into "older boomers", which they defined as born between 1946 and 1955, and "younger boomers", which they defined as born between 1956 and 1964. They found much of the cultural identity of the baby-boomer generation is associated with the "older boomers", while half of the "younger boomers" were averse to being associated with the baby-boomer cohort and a third of those born between 1956 and 1964 actively identified as members of Generation X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boomer Bookend: Insight Into the Oldest and Youngest Boomers|url=https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/mmi-boomer-bookends.pdf|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=MetLife|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographers [[Strauss–Howe generational theory|William Strauss and Neil Howe]] rejected the frequently used 1964 end-date of the baby-boomer cohort (which results in a 1965 start-year for Generation X), saying that a majority of those born between 1961 and 1964 do not self-identify as boomers, and that they are culturally distinct from boomers in terms of shared historical experiences. Howe says that while many demographers use 1965 as a start date for Generation X, this is a statement about fertility in the population (birth-rates which began declining in 1957, declined more sharply following 1964) and fails to take into consideration the shared history and cultural identity of the individuals. Strauss and Howe define Generation X as those born between 1961 and 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Booknotes – Generations: The History of Americas Future|url=http://www.booknotes.org/Watch/17548-1/William+Strauss.aspx|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=CSPAN|date=14 April 1991|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703075922/http://booknotes.org/Watch/17548-1/William%2BStrauss.aspx|archivedate=3 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069|date=1992|isbn=978-0688119126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "13th Gen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=13th Gen: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?|date=1993|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0679743651}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strauss|first1=William|title=The Fourth Turning|date=2009|publisher=Three Rivers Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many researchers and demographers continue to use dates which correspond to the strict fertility-patterns in the population, which results in a Generation X starting-date of 1965, such as [[Pew Research Center]] which uses a range of 1965–1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Millennials overtake Baby Boomers as America's largest generation|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/25/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers/|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=Pew Research|date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; MetLife which uses 1965–1976,&lt;ref name="MetLife2"/&gt; Australia's McCrindle Research Center which uses 1965–1979,&lt;ref name="McCrindle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCrindle|first1=Mark|title=Generations Defined|url=http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=McCrindle Research Center|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616232732/http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf|archive-date=2016-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] which also uses 1965–1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Timmerman|first1=John|title=How Hotels Can Engage Gen X and Millennial Guests|url=http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/173537/hotels-engage-gen-millennial-guests.aspx|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=Gallup|date=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

===United States===

A 2010 Census report counted approximately 84 million people living in the U.S. who are defined by birth years ranging from the early 1960s to the early 80s.&lt;ref name="U.S. Census"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Census Age and Sex Composition: 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census|accessdate=2013-09-12|page=4|date=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 article for the [[Joint Center for Housing Studies]] of [[Harvard University]], George Masnick wrote that the "Census counted 82.1&amp;nbsp;million" Gen Xers in the U.S. The Harvard Center uses 1965 to 1984 to define Gen X so that Boomers, Xers, and [[Millennials]] "cover equal 20-year age spans".&lt;ref name="Masnick"/&gt; Masnick concluded that immigration filled in any birth year deficits during low fertility years of the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Masnick"/&gt;

Jon Miller at the Longitudinal Study of American Youth at the [[University of Michigan]] wrote that "Generation X refers to adults born between 1961 and 1981" and it "includes 84 million people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Jon|title=The Generation X Report: Active, Balanced, and Happy: These Young Americans are not Bowling Alone|url=http://lsay.org/GenX_Rept_Iss1.pdf|publisher=Longitudinal Study of American Youth – University Of Michigan|accessdate=29 May 2013|page=1|date=Fall 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 1991 book "Generations" authors and demographers Neil Howe and William Strauss, used 1961 to 1981 for Gen X birth years. At the time it was published they wrote that there are approximately 88.5 million U.S. Gen Xers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=William Strauss|first=Neil Howe|title=Generations|year=1991|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=0-688-11912-3|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[birth control pill]], introduced in the early 1960s, was one contributing factor of declining birth rates seen in the late 1960s and 70s. However, increased immigration partially offset declining birth rates and contributed to making Generation X an ethnically and culturally diverse demographic cohort.&lt;ref name ="Adweek"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klara|first1=Robert|title=5 Reasons Marketers Have Largely Overlooked Generation X|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/5-reasons-marketers-have-largely-overlooked-generation-x-170539|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=Adweek|date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohort confusion"/&gt;

===As children and adolescents===
[[Strauss–Howe generational theory|Demographers William Strauss and Neil Howe]], who authored several books on generations, including the 1993 book specifically on Generation X ''13th Gen: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?'', reported that Gen Xers were children at a time when society was less focused on children and more focused on adults.&lt;ref name = "13th Gen"/&gt;  Gen Xers were children during a time of increasing [[divorce]] rates, with divorce rates doubling in the mid-1960s, before peaking in 1980.&lt;ref name ="Adweek"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dulaney|first1=Josh|title=A Generation Stuck in the Middle Turns 50|url=http://projects.presstelegram.com/gen-x-turns-50/|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=PT Projects|date=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawson|first1=Alene|title=Gen X women, young for their age|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/25/image/la-ig-beauty-genx-20110925|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=LA Times|date=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss and Howe described a cultural shift where the long-held societal value of staying together for the sake of the children was replaced with a societal value of parental and individual [[self-actualization]]. Strauss wrote that society "moved from what Leslie Fiedler called a 1950s-era 'cult of the child' to what Landon Jones called a 1970s-era 'cult of the adult'."&lt;ref name = "13th Gen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strauss"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strauss|first1=William|title=What Future Awaits Today's Youth in the New Millennium?|url=https://www.angelo.edu/events/university_symposium/97_Strauss.php|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=Angelo State University|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808195038/https://www.angelo.edu/events/university_symposium/97_Strauss.php|archivedate=8 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Generation Map'', a report from Australia's McCrindle Research Center writes of Gen X children: "their [[Baby boomers|Boomer]] parents were the most divorced generation in Australian history".&lt;ref name = GenMap&gt;{{cite news|title=The Generation Map|url=http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-03_The-Generation-Map_Mark-McCrindle.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2016|publisher=McCrindle Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gen X childhood coincided with the [[sexual revolution]], which Susan Gregory Thomas described in her book ''In Spite of Everything'' as confusing and frightening for children in cases where a parent would bring new sexual partners into their home. Thomas also discussed how divorce was different during the Gen X childhood, with the child having a limited or severed relationship with one parent following divorce, often the father, due to differing societal and legal expectations. In the 1970s, only 9 U.S states allowed for [[joint custody]] of children, which has since been adopted by all 50 states following a push for joint custody during the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Susan|title=All Apologies: Thank You for the ‘Sorry’|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-gregory-thomas/all-apologies-thank-you-f_b_931718.html|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Susan|title=In Spite of Everything|year= 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1400068821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The time period of the Gen X childhood saw an increase in [[latchkey child]]ren, leading to the terminology of the "latchkey generation" for Generation X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blakemore|first1=Erin|title=The Latchkey Generation: How Bad Was It?|url=http://daily.jstor.org/latchkey-generation-bad/|accessdate=5 April 2016|publisher=JSTOR Daily|date=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clack|first1=Erin|title=Study probes generation gap.(Hot copy: an industry update)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-116445054.html|website=HighBeam Research|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/11/02/141930849/whats-the-defining-moment-of-your-generation|title=What's The Defining Moment Of Your Generation?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These latchkey children lacked adult supervision in the hours between the end of the school day and when a parent returned home from work in the evening, and for longer periods of time during the summer. Latchkey children became common among all socioeconomic demographics, but were particularly common among middle and upper class children. The higher the educational attainment of the parents, the higher the odds the children of this time would be latchkey children, due to increased maternal participation in the workforce at a time before childcare options outside the home were widely available.&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Susan|title=All Apologies: Thank You for the ‘Sorry’|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-gregory-thomas/all-apologies-thank-you-f_b_931718.html|accessdate=2 April 2016|publisher=Huffington Post|date=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Teacher's Guide to Generation X|url=http://www.edutopia.org/generation-x-parents-relationships-guide|website=Edutopia|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Susan|title=The Divorce Generation|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303544604576430341393583056|accessdate=2 April 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Toch|first1=Thomas|title=The Making of 'To Save Our Schools, To Save Our Children': A Conversation With Marshall Frady|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1984/09/19/05550017.h04.html|accessdate=17 April 2016|publisher=Education Week|date=19 September 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Corry|first1=John|title=A Look at Schools in U.S.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/04/arts/a-look-at-schools-in-us.html|accessdate=17 April 2016|publisher=The New York Times|date=4 September 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCrindle Research Center described the cohort as "the first to grow up without a large adult presence, with both parents working", stating this led to Gen Xers being more peer-oriented than previous generations.&lt;ref name = GenMap/&gt;

The United Kingdom's [[Economic and Social Research Council]] described Generation X as "Thatcher's children" because the cohort grew up while [[Margaret Thatcher]] was Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990, "a time of social flux and transformation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thatcher's children: the lives of Generation X|url=http://www.esrc.ac.uk/news-events-and-publications/news/news-items/thatcher-s-children-the-lives-of-generation-x/|accessdate=2 August 2016|publisher=Economic and Social Research Council|date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[South Africa]], Gen Xers spent their formative years of the 1980s during the "hyper-politicized environment of the final years of [[apartheid]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schenk|first1=Jan|title=Locating generation X: Taste and identity in transitional South Africa|url=https://open.uct.ac.za/bitstream/item/22088/Schenk_Locating_Generation_X_Taste_2012.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=25 August 2016|issue=CSSR Working Paper No. 284|publisher=Centre For Social Science Research|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, Generation X was the first cohort to grow up post-integration. They were described in a marketing report by ''Specialty Retail'' as the kids who "lived the [[civil rights movement]]." They were among the first children to be [[Desegregation busing|bused]] to attain [[Racial integration|integration]] in the public school system. In the 1990s, Strauss reported Gen Xers were "by any measure the least racist of today's generations".&lt;ref name="Strauss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Retail"&gt;{{cite news|title=Generation X|url=http://specialtyretail.com/issue/2003/07/running-a-cart-or-kiosk/generation-x/|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=Specialty Retail|date=Summer 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, [[Title IX]], which passed in 1972, provided increased athletic opportunities to Gen X girls in the public school setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Underwood|first1=Chuck|title=America's Generations With Chuck Underwood - Generation X|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6ZGuilmLcc|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Russia]], Generation Xers are referred to as "the last Soviet children", as the last children to come of age prior to the downfall of [[communism]] in their nation and prior to the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="McCrindle"/&gt;

Politically, in the United States, the Gen X childhood coincided with a time when government funding tended to be diverted away from programs for children and often instead directed toward the elderly population, with cuts to [[Medicaid]] and programs for children and young families, and protection and expansion of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] for the elderly population. One in five American children grew up in poverty during this time. These programs for the elderly were not tied to economic need. Congressman [[David Durenberger]] criticized this political situation, stating that while programs for poor children and for young families were cut, the government provided "free health care to elderly millionaires".&lt;ref name="Strauss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holtz|first1=Geoffrey|title=Welcome to the Jungle: The Why Behind Generation X|year= 1995|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|isbn=978-0312132101|pages=49–50|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2Ay28CTKlgsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=welcome+to+the+jungle+they+why+behind+generation+x#v=onepage&amp;q=welcome%20to%20the%20jungle%20they%20why%20behind%20generation%20x|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gen Xers came of age or were children during the [[crack epidemic]], which disproportionately impacted urban areas and also the [[African-American]] community in the US. Drug turf battles increased violent crime, and [[Crack cocaine|crack addiction]] impacted communities and families. Between 1984 and 1989, the homicide rate for black males aged 14 to 17 doubled in the US, and the homicide rate for black males aged 18 to 24 increased almost as much. The crack epidemic had a destabilizing impact on families with an increase in the number of children in [[foster care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fryer|first1=Roland|title=Measuring Crack Cocaine and Its Impact|journal=Harvard University Society of Fellows|date=April 2006|pages=3, 66|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/fhlm_crack_cocaine_0.pdf|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yuppies, Beware: Here Comes Generation X|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/yuppies-beware-here-comes-generation-x/article_ce19c561-c82d-51b0-a0f9-0f680bc50da9.html|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=Tulsa World|date=9 July 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generation X was the first cohort to come of age with [[MTV]] and are sometimes called the [[MTV Generation]].&lt;ref name = "MetLife"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Isaksen 2002"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100500/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041024071508/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100500|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2004-10-24|work=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture|title=Generation X|first=Judy L.|last=Isaksen|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They experienced the emergence of [[punk rock]], [[music video]]s, [[grunge]], [[alternative rock]] and [[hip hop]].&lt;ref name="My So Called Adulthood"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/magazine/the-gen-x-nostalgia-boom.html|work=New York Times|title=My So Called Adulthood|date=2011-08-04|accessdate=2011-08-25|first1=Carl|last1=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of [[AIDS]] coincided with Gen X's adolescence, with the disease first clinically observed in the United States in 1981. By 1985, an estimated one to two million Americans were HIV positive. As the virus spread, at a time before effective treatments were available, a public panic ensued. [[Sex education]] programs in schools were adapted to address the AIDS epidemic which taught Gen X students that sex could kill you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Generation X Reacts to AIDS|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/generation-x/videos/gen-x-reacts-to-aids/|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=National Geographic Channel|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Halkitis|first1=Perry|title=The Disease That Defined My Generation|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/perry-n-halkitis-phd-ms/the-disease-that-defined-_b_5881884.html|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gen Xers were the first children to have access to [[personal computers|computers]] in their homes and schools.&lt;ref name = GenMap/&gt; Generally, Gen Xers are the children of the [[Silent Generation]] and older [[Baby Boomers]].&lt;ref name="Gordinier"/&gt;&lt;ref name = GenMap/&gt;

===As young adults===
In the 1990s, media pundits and advertisers struggled to define the cohort, typically portraying them as "unfocused twentysomethings". A [[MetLife]] report noted: "media would portray them as the ''[[Friends Series|Friends]]'' generation: rather self-involved and perhaps aimless...but fun." &lt;ref name="MetLife"&gt;{{cite news|title=The MetLife Study of Gen X: The MTV Generation Moves into Mid-Life|url=https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/2013/mmi-gen-x.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=MetLife|date=April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021014452/https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/2013/mmi-gen-x.pdf|archive-date=2016-10-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Time1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gross|first1=David|title=Living: Proceeding With Caution|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,970634-1,00.html|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=Time|date=16 July 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, Gen Xers were sometimes referred to as 'Génération Bof' because of their tendency to use the word 'bof', which translated into English means 'whatever".&lt;ref name="McCrindle"/&gt; Gen Xers were often portrayed as [[Apathy|apathetic]] or as "[[slackers]]", a stereotype which was initially tied to [[Richard Linklater]]'s comedic and essentially plotless 1991 film ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]''. After the film was released, "journalists and critics thought they put a finger on what was different about these young adults in that 'they were reluctant to grow up' and 'disdainful of earnest action'."&lt;ref name= "Time1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=ScrIibner|first1=Sara|title=Generation X gets really old: How do slackers have a midlife crisis?|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/11/generation_x_gets_really_old_how_do_slackers_have_a_midlife_crisis/|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=Salon|date=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotypes of Gen X young adults also included that they were "bleak, cynical, and disaffected". Such stereotypes prompted sociological research at [[Stanford University]] to study the accuracy of the characterization of Gen X young adults as cynical and disaffected. Using the national [[General Social Survey]], the researchers compared answers to identical survey questions asked of 18–29-year-olds in three different time periods. Additionally, they compared how older adults answered the same survey questions over time. The surveys showed 18–29-year-old Gen Xers did exhibit higher levels of cynicism and disaffection than previous cohorts of 18–29-year-olds surveyed; however, they also found that cynicism and disaffection had increased among all age groups surveyed over time, not just young adults, making this a period effect, not a [[cohort effect]]. In other words, adults of all ages were more cynical and disaffected in the 1990s, not just Generation X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Generation X not so special: Malaise, cynicism on the rise for all age groups|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/98/980821genx.html|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oldsters Get The Gen X Feeling|url=http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/19980729080415data_trunc_sys.shtml|accessdate=11 July 2016|publisher=SCI GOGO|date=29 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published an article titled "Living: Proceeding with Caution", which described those in their 20s as aimless and unfocused; however, in 1997, they published an article titled "Generation X Reconsidered", which retracted the previously reported negative stereotypes and reported positive accomplishments, citing Gen Xers' tendency to found technology start-ups and small businesses as well as Gen Xers' ambition, which research showed was higher among Gen X young adults than older generations.&lt;ref name="Time1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jury Expert"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keene|first1=Douglas|title=Generation X members are "active, balanced and happy".

In 1999, ''[[The New York Times]]'' dubbed them "Generation 1099", describing them as the "once pitied but now envied group of [[self-employed]] workers whose income is reported to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] not on a [[W-2 form]], but on [[Form 1099]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ellin|first1=Abby|title=Preludes; A Generation of Freelancers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/15/business/preludes-a-generation-of-freelancers.html|accessdate=1 July 2016|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=15 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, ''Time'' magazine published an article titled ''Gen Xers Aren't Slackers After All'', reporting four out of five new businesses were the work of Gen Xers.&lt;ref name="Retail"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chatzky|first1=Jean|title=Gen Xers Aren't Slackers After All|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,221136,00.html|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=Time|date=31 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, Gen Xers were described as the major heroes of the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]] by demographer [[Strauss–Howe generational theory|William Strauss]]. The firefighters and police responding to the attacks were predominantly Generation Xers.

In the book, Gordinier contrasts Gen Xers to Baby Boomers, saying Boomers tend to trumpet their accomplishments more than Gen Xers do, creating what he describes as "elaborate mythologies" around their achievements.

In 2011, survey analysis from the ''Longitudinal Study of American Youth'' found Gen Xers to be "balanced, active, and happy" in midlife (between ages of 30 and 50) and as achieving a [[work-life balance]]. The Longitudinal Study of Youth is an [[NIH]]-[[National Institute on Aging|NIA]] funded study by the University of Michigan which has been studying Generation X since 1987. The study asked questions such as "Thinking about all aspects of your life, how happy are you? If zero means that you are very unhappy and 10 means that you are very happy, please rate your happiness." LSA reported that "[[mean]] level of happiness was 7.5 and the [[median]] (middle score) was 8.

In terms of advocating for their children in the educational setting, demographer [[Neil Howe]] describes Gen X parents as distinct from Baby Boomer parents. Howe argues that Gen Xers are not [[helicopter parents]], which Howe describes as a parenting style of Boomer parents of Millennials. Howe described Gen Xers instead as "stealth fighter parents", due to the tendency of Gen X parents to let minor issues go and to not hover over their children in the educational setting, but to intervene forcefully and swiftly in the event of more serious issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=Meet Mr. and Mrs. Gen X: A New Parent Generation|url=http://www.aasa.org/SchoolAdministratorArticle.aspx?id=11122|accessdate=19 April 2016|publisher=AASA – The School Superintendents Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the [[Corporation for National and Community Service]] ranked Gen X volunteer rates in the U.S. at "29.4% per year", the highest compared with other generations.

====Punk====
{{main|Punk rock}}
As Generation X began to enter adolescence a new generation of rock bands arose such as the [[Ramones]], [[Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers]], [[Richard Hell and the Voidoids]] in [[New York City]], the [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Clash]], [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] and, [[Buzzcocks]] in the [[UK]], and [[The Saints (Australian band)|the Saints]] in [[Brisbane]]— by late-1976 these acts were generally recognized as forming the vanguard of "punk rock".  While at first the bands were not Gen Xers themselves, the fan base for the early bands was increasingly Gen X and it therefore made a significant imprint on the cohort.&lt;ref&gt;GUZMAN, RICHARD; Grunge, rap music movements of the early 1990s became Gen X’s soundtrack; | riguzman@scng.com | Press Telegram PUBLISHED: December 28, 2015 at 9:25 pm | UPDATED: September 1, 2017 at 1:04 am; [https://www.presstelegram.com/2015/12/28/grunge-rap-music-movements-of-the-early-1990s-became-gen-xs-soundtrack/] "The Gen X soundtrack was more of a mixtape that ranged from feel-good dance and pop music, to punk, glam rock, new wave, alternative and rap."&lt;/ref&gt; As 1977 approached and the first Gen Xers were solidly in their teens, punk rock became a major and highly controversial cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Punk, AllMusic -  https://www.allmusic.com/style/punk-ma0000002806 "in both the U.K. and the U.S. In America, punk remained an underground sensation, eventually spawning the hardcore and indie-rock scenes of the '80s, but in the UK, it was a full-scale phenomenon. In the U.K., the Sex Pistols were thought of as a serious threat to the well-being of the government and monarchy, but more importantly, they caused countless bands to form."&lt;/ref&gt;  It spawned a [[punk subculture]] expressing youthful rebellion characterized by distinctive [[Punk fashion|styles of clothing and adornment]] (ranging from deliberately offensive T-shirts, leather jackets, studded or spiked bands and jewelry, as well as bondage and S&amp;M clothes) and a variety of [[Punk ideologies|anti-authoritarian ideologies]] that have since been associated with the form.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick,John; Punk Rock Is Bullshit: How a Toxic Social Movement Poisoned Our Culture, Seattle Weekly; Wednesday, February 27, 2013 5:54pm; http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/for-those-of-us-who-grew-up-in-the-shadow-of-the/ "For those of us who grew up in the shadow of the baby boom, force-fed the misremembered vainglory of Woodstock long after most hippies had become coked-out, craven yuppies on their way to becoming paranoid neo-cons, punk rock provided a corrective dose of hard truth. Punk was ugly and ugly was true, no matter how many new choruses the boomers added to their song of self-praise. It was this perceived honesty that we, the nascent Generation X, feared and worshipped. But over time punk swelled into a Stalinistic doctrine of self-denial that stunted us. The yuppies kept sucking, but by clinging to punk we started to suck too."&lt;/ref&gt;  	
	
By 1977 the influence of punk rock music and subculture became more pervasive, spreading throughout various countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;The History and Evolution of Punk Rock Music, Updated April 10, 2018, ThoughtCo https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-punk-rock-2803345 "By the late '70s, punk had finished its beginning and had emerged as a solid musical force. With its rise in popularity, punk began to split into numerous sub-genres. New musicians embraced the DIY movement and began to create their own individual scenes with specific sounds."&lt;/ref&gt;  It generally took root in local scenes that tended to reject affiliation with the [[mainstream]].&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Texas Online, John H.

The original punk rockers were late-period boomers eager to distance themselves from the supercilious upper end of their demographic, and their music, reflecting the dour economics of the late '70s, became a template for Generation X and the ensuing "post-punk" movement that eventually birthed grunge."&lt;/ref&gt;  By the early 1980s, faster and more aggressive subgenres such as [[hardcore punk]] (e.g. [[Minor Threat]]), [[street punk]] (e.g. [[the Exploited]], [[NOFX]]) and [[anarcho-punk]] (e.g. [[Subhumans (British band)|Subhumans]]) became the predominant modes of punk rock.  Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk often later pursued other musical directions, resulting in a broad range of spinoffs, giving rise to genres such as [[post-punk]], [[new wave music|new wave]] and later [[indie pop]], [[alternative rock]], and [[noise rock]].  By the 1990s punk rock re-emerged in the mainstream, as punk rock and [[pop punk]] bands with Gen X members such as [[Green Day]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[The Offspring]], and [[Blink-182]] brought the genre widespread popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Punk, Encyclopedia Britannica, Jon Savage
LAST UPDATED: Nov 14, 2018 https://www.britannica.com/art/punk"Punk’s full impact came only after the success of Nirvana in 1991, coinciding with the ascendance of Generation X—a new, disaffected generation born in the 1960s, many members of which identified with punk’s charged, often contradictory mix of intelligence, simplicity, anger, and powerlessness."&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to lyrical self-glorification, hip hop was also used as a form of social protest. Lyrical content from the era often drew attention to a variety of social issues including afrocentric living, drug use, crime and violence, religion, culture, the state of the American economy, and the modern man's struggle. [[Conscious hip hop|Conscious]] and [[political hip hop]] tracks of the time were a response to the effects of American capitalism and former President Reagan's conservative political economy. According to Rose Tricia, "In rap, relationships between black cultural practice, social and economic conditions, technology, sexual and racial politics, and the institution policing of the popular terrain are complex and in constant motion. Even though hip hop was used as a mechanism for different social issues it was still very complex with issues within the movement itself.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Tricia. ''Black Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary American''. Hanover: Wesleyan U, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also often an emphasis on [[black nationalism]]. Hip hop artists often talked about urban poverty and the problems of alcohol, drugs, and gangs in their communities.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s most influential song, "[[Fight the Power (Public Enemy song)|Fight the Power]]," came out at this time; the song speaks up to the government, proclaiming that people in the ghetto have freedom of speech and rights like every other American.

===Indie films===
Gen Xers were largely responsible for the "[[Independent film|indie film]]" movement of the 1990s, both as young directors and in large part as the movie audiences fueling demand for such films.&lt;ref name = "Time2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alternative Goes Mainstream"/&gt; In cinema, directors [[Kevin Smith]], [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Sofia Coppola]], [[John Singleton]], [[Spike Jonze]], [[David Fincher]], [[Steven Soderbergh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanson|first=Peter|title=The Cinema of Generation X: A Critical Study of Films and Directors|year=2002|publisher=McFarland and Company|location=North Carolina and London|isbn=0-7864-1334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.viewaskew.com/press/time/article.html|title=My Generation Believes We Can Do Anything |last=Time|first=Magazine|date=1998-06-09|publisher=View Askew|accessdate=2011-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Linklater]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard Linklater, ''Slacker'', St Martins Griffin, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tasker|first=Yvonne|title=Fifty Contemporary Film Directors |page= 365|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year= 2010|isbn=0415554330}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been called Generation X filmmakers.

===Workforce participation and income===

A report titled ''Economic Mobility: Is the American Dream Alive and Well?'' focused on the income of males 30–39 in 2004 (those born April 1964{{spaced ndash}}March 1974). The study was released on May 25, 2007 and emphasized that this generation's men made less (by 12%) than their fathers had at that same age in 1974, thus reversing a historical trend. It concluded that per year increases in household income generated by fathers/sons have slowed (from an average of 0.9% to 0.3%), barely keeping pace with inflation. "Family incomes have risen though (over the period 1947 to 2005) because more women have gone to work",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate: Women|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300002|website=FRED: Economic Data|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|date=1950–2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate: Men|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300001|website=FRED: Economic Data|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis|ref=1950 to 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Isabel Sawhill, Ph.D 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Making less than dad did"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/05/25/pf/mobility_study/index.htm?cnn=yes|work=CNN|title=Making less than dad did|date=2007-05-25|accessdate=2010-05-03|first1=David|last1=Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt; "supporting the incomes of men, by adding a second earner to the family.

''Generation Flux'' is a [[neologism]] and [[psychographic]] designation coined by ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' for [[economy of the United States|American employees]] who need to make several changes in [[career]] throughout their working lives because of the chaotic nature of the job market following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]]. Those in "Generation Flux" have birth years in the ranges of Gen X and Millennials.

===Entrepreneurship===
According to authors Michael Hais and Morley Winograd: &lt;blockquote&gt;Small businesses and the entrepreneurial spirit that Gen Xers embody have become one of the most popular institutions in America. There's been a recent shift in consumer behavior and Gen Xers will join the "idealist generation" in encouraging the celebration of individual effort and business risk-taking. As a result, Xers will spark a renaissance of [[entrepreneurship]] in economic life, even as overall confidence in economic institutions declines. Customers, and their needs and wants (including Millennials) will become the North Star for an entire new generation of entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Generation X is Sparking a Renaissance in Entrepreneurship|url=http://www.beinkandescent.com/articles/942/GenX|accessdate=2013-04-22|author=Morley Winograd|author2=Michael Hais|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Hamar''' (also spelled '''Hamer''') are an [[Omotic languages|Omotic]] community inhabiting southwestern [[Ethiopia]]. They live in [[Hamer (woreda)|Hamer]] [[woreda]] (or district), a fertile part of the [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo River]] valley, in the [[Debub Omo Zone]] of the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region]] (SNNPR).  They are largely pastoralists, so their culture places a high value on cattle.

==Demographics==
The 2003 national census reported 46,532 people in this ethnic group, of whom 10000 were urban inhabitants. The vast majority (99.13%) live in the SNNPR.&lt;ref name=2007-census&gt;[http://www.csa.gov.et/pdf/Cen2007_firstdraft.pdf 2007 Ethiopian census, first draft], Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency (accessed 6 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ethiopian national census of 1994, there were 42,838 Hamer language speakers, and 42,448 self-identified Hamer people, representing approximately 0.1% of the total Ethiopian population.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Grover.

[[File:Hamer bull jumping (6) (29167685366).jpg|thumb|Bull-jumping ceremony]]
The Hamar are known for their unique custom of "bull jumping," which initiates a boy into manhood. First, female relatives dance and invite whipping from men who have recently been initiated; this shows their support of the initiate, and their scars give them a say on who they marry.






 The boy must run back and forth twice across the backs of a row of bulls or castrated steers, and is ridiculed if he fails. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wharton|first1=Jane|title=The making of a man: Inside a bull jumping ceremony with Ethiopia's Hamer tribe|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/559757/Hamer-tribe-bull-jumping-ceremony-Omo-Valley-Ethiopia|accessdate=8 March 2016|publisher=Express (London)|date=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assistant Administrator of Hamer Bena, Ato Imnet Gashab, has commented that only seven tribal members have ever completed secondary education.

The '''German minority in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union''' was created from several sources and in several waves. The 1914 census put the number of Germans living in the [[Russian Empire]] at 2,416,290.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exulanten.com/trails3.html|title=The Long March of the Innocents|author=L Schaitberger|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, the German population of the [[Soviet Union]] was roughly 2 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DE1730F932A25752C0A964958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Bonn Urges Russia to Restore Land for Its Ethnic Germans], New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; By 2002, the population fell by half to roughly one million. 597,212 Germans were enumerated in Russia ([[Demography of Russia|2002 Russian census]]), making Germans the fifth largest [[ethnic group]] in that country. There were 353,441 [[Germans of Kazakhstan|Germans in Kazakhstan]] and 21,472 in [[Kyrgyzstan]] (1999);&lt;ref&gt;[http://lgi.osi.hu/ethnic/csdb/results.asp?idx=no&amp;id=264 Case Studies Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808193844/http://lgi.osi.hu/ethnic/csdb/results.asp?idx=no&amp;id=264 |date=2009-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while 33,300 Germans lived in [[Ukraine]] (2001 census).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/nationality/ 2001 Ukrainian Population Census] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706003257/http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/nationality/ |date=2007-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Russian Empire, Germans were strongly represented among royalty, aristocracy, large land owners, military officers and the upper echelons of the imperial service, engineers, scientists, artists, physicians and the [[bourgeoisie]] in general. The Germans of Russia did not necessarily speak Russian; many spoke German, while French was often the language of the high aristocracy. However, depending on geography and other circumstances, many Russian-Germans spoke Russian as their first or second language. During the 19th century, many came to identify primarily as Russians, and particularly during and after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], many Russian-Germans embraced Russian [[patriotism]]. Today's Russian Germans mostly speak [[Russian language|Russian]] as they are in the gradual process of assimilation. As such, many may not necessarily be fluent in German. Consequently, Germany has recently strictly limited their immigration, and a decline in the number of Germans in the Russian Federation has moderated as they no longer emigrate to Germany and as Kazakh Germans move to Russia instead of Germany. As conditions for the Germans generally deteriorated in the late 19th century and early 20th century, many Germans migrated from Russia to the Americas and elsewhere, collectively known as [[Germans from Russia]].

==Germans in Imperial Russia (partitioned Poland and Caucasus)==
The earliest German settlement in Russia dates back to the reign of [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili III]], Grand Prince of Moscow from 1505 to 1533. A handful of German and Dutch craftsmen and traders were allowed to establish themselves in [[Moscow]]'s [[German Quarter]] (''Немецкая слобода'', or Nemetskaya ''[[sloboda]]''), providing essential technical skills in the capital. Gradually, this policy extended to a few other major cities. In 1682, Moscow had about 200,000 citizens; 18,000 of them were ''Nemtsy'', which means either "German" or "western foreigner".

The international community located in the German Quarter greatly influenced [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] (reigned 1682-1725), and his efforts to transform Russia into a more modern European state are believed to have derived in large part from his experiences among Russia's established Germans.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} By the late 17th-century, foreigners were no longer so rare in Russian cities, and Moscow's German Quarter had lost its ethnic character by the end of that century.

===Vistula Germans (Poland)===
{{main article|Vistula Germans}}
{{see also|Olędrzy}}
Through wars and the partitions of Poland, [[Prussia]] acquired an increasing amount of northern, western, and central Polish territory. The [[Vistula River]] flows south to north, to near [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] (now [[Gdańsk]]). Germans and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] settled its valley starting from the [[Baltic Sea]] and moving further south with time. Eventually, Prussia acquired most of the Vistula's watershed, and the central portion of then-Poland became [[South Prussia]]. Its existence was brief - 1793 to 1806, but by its end many German settlers had established [[Protestant]] agricultural settlements within its earlier borders. From already-Prussian [[Silesia]] to the southwest some German [[Roman Catholics]] also entered the region. The [http://www.upstreamvistula.org/History/Breyer_Map.htm 1935 "Breyer Map"] shows the distribution of German settlements in what became central Poland.

Napoleon's victories ended the short existence of South Prussia. The French Emperor incorporated it and other territories into the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. After Napoleon's defeat in 1815, however, the Duchy was divided. The western [[Grand Duchy of Posen|Posen]] region again became part of Prussia, while what is now central Poland became the Russian client-state [[Congress Poland]]. Many Germans remained in this central region, maintaining their middle-German Prussian dialect, similar to the Silesian dialect, and their religions. With World Wars I and II, the eastern front hovered on their doorstep and conscription increased. The Vistula Germans' migrations from Congress Poland increased. Some became [[German minority in Poland|Polonized]], however, and their descendants remain in Poland. After World War II, many of those who retained their German language and customs were forcibly expelled by the Russians and the Poles, with the loss of all their property.

===Volga Germans (Russian Germans)===
{{Main article|Volga Germans}}
[[File:Catherine II in youth by A.R. Lisiewska (de Gasc), 1742, Russian Museum.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Catherine the Great]] - the most famous Russian Empress of German descent]]&lt;!--as she was known as very attractive woman, she should be shown at not old age!--&gt;
Tsarina [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] was a German, born in [[Stettin]] in Pomerania, now Szczecin in Poland. She proclaimed open immigration for foreigners wishing to live in the Russian Empire on July 22, 1763, marking the beginning of a much larger presence for Germans in the Empire. German [[colony (Russia)|colonies]] in the lower [[Volga river]] area were founded almost immediately afterward. These early colonies were attacked during the [[Yemelyan Pugachev|Pugachev uprising]], which was centred on the Volga area, but they survived the rebellion.

German immigration was motivated in part by religious intolerance and warfare in central Europe as well as by frequently difficult economic conditions. Catherine II's declaration freed German immigrants from military service (imposed on native Russians) and from most taxes. It placed the new arrivals outside of Russia's feudal hierarchy and granted them considerable internal autonomy. Moving to Russia gave German immigrants political rights that they would not have possessed in their own lands. Religious minorities found these terms very agreeable, particularly [[Russian Mennonite|Mennonites]] from the [[Vistula River]] valley. Their unwillingness to participate in military service, and their long tradition of dissent from mainstream [[Lutheranism]] and [[Calvinism]], made life under the Prussians very difficult for them. Nearly all of the Prussian Mennonites emigrated to Russia over the following century, leaving no more than a handful in Prussia.

Other German minority churches took advantage of Catherine II's offer as well, particularly [[Evangelical Christians]] like the [[Baptists]]. Although Catherine's declaration forbade them from proselytising among members of the [[Orthodox church]], they could evangelize Russia's Muslim and other non-Christian minorities.

German colonization was most intense in the [[Lower Volga]], but other areas also saw an influx. The area around the [[Black Sea]] received many German immigrants, and the Mennonites favoured the lower [[Dniepr river]] area, around Ekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipro]]) and Aleksandrovsk (now [[Zaporizhia]]).

In 1803 Catherine II's grandson, [[Tsar Alexander I]], reissued her proclamation. In the chaos of the [[Napoleonic wars]], the response from Germans was enormous. Ultimately, the Tsar imposed minimum financial requirements on new immigrants, requiring them to either have 300 [[South German gulden|gulden]] in cash or special skills in order to come to Russia.

The abolition of [[serfdom]] in the Russian Empire in 1863 created a shortage of labour in agriculture and motivated new German immigration, particularly from increasingly crowded central European states, where there was no longer enough fertile land for full employment in agriculture.

Furthermore, a sizable part of Russia's ethnic Germans migrated into Russia from its Polish possessions. The 18th-century [[partitions of Poland]] (1772–1795) dismantled the Polish-Lithuanian state, dividing it between Austria, Prussia and Russia. Many Germans already living in those parts of Poland transferred to Russia, dating back to [[medieval]] and later migrations. Many Germans in Congress Poland migrated further east into Russia between then and [[World War I]], particularly in the aftermath of the [[November Uprising|Polish insurrection of 1830]]. The [[January Uprising|Polish insurrection in 1863]] added a new wave of German emigration from Poland to those who had already moved east, and led to the founding of extensive German colonies in [[Volhynia]]. When Poland reclaimed its independence in 1918 after [[World War I]], it ceased to be a source of German emigration to Russia, but by then many hundreds of thousands of Germans had already settled in enclaves across the Russian Empire.

Germans settled in the [[Caucasus|Caucasus area]] from the beginning of the 19th century and in the 1850s expanded into the [[Crimea]]. In the 1890s new German colonies opened in the [[Altay Mountains|Altay mountain]] area in Russian Asia (see [[Mennonite settlements of Altai]]). German colonial areas continued to expand in [[Ukraine]] as late as the beginning of [[World War I]].

According to the [[Russian Empire Census|first census of the Russian Empire]] in 1897, about 1.8 million respondents reported German as their [[mother tongue]].

===Black Sea Germans (Moldova and Ukraine)===

{{main article|Black Sea Germans|Russian Mennonites|South Ukraine}}

The Black Sea Germans - including the [[Bessarabian Germans]] and the [[Dobrujan Germans]] - settled the territories of the northern bank of the [[Black Sea]] in present-day Ukraine in the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Catherine the Great]] had gained this land for Russia through her two wars with the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1768–1774) and from the annexation of the [[Crimean Khanate]]s (1783). The area of settlement was not settled as compactly as that of the [[Volga]] territory, rather it became home to a chain of colonies. The first German settlers arrived in 1787, first from [[West Prussia]], then later from [[Western Germany|Western]] and Southwestern Germany, and from the [[Warsaw]] area. Also many Germans, beginning in 1803, immigrated from the northeastern area of Alsace west of the Rhine, and settled roughly 30 miles northeast of Odessa (city) in Ukraine, forming several enclaves that quickly multiplied with daughter colonies springing up nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Stumpp, "The Emigration From Germany to Russia in the Years 1763-1862"&lt;/ref&gt;

;Crimea
{{main article|Crimea Germans|Crimean Goths}}

From 1783 onwards a systematic settlement of [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], and Germans in the [[Crimean Peninsula]] (in what was then the [[Crimean Khanate]]) aimed to dilute the native population of the [[Crimean Tatars]].

In 1939, two years before their [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportation]] to [[Central Asia]], around 60,000 of the 1.1 million inhabitants of Crimea were German.

Under [[perestroika]] in the late 1980s Germans gained the right to return to the peninsula.

===Germans of Volhynia (Belarus, Poland and Ukraine)===
The migration of Germans into [[Volhynia]] ({{as of | 2013 | lc = on}} covering northwestern [[Ukraine]] from a short distance west of Kiev to the border with Poland) occurred under significantly different conditions than those going to other parts of Russia. By the end of the 19th century Volhynia had over 200,000 German settlers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ualberta.ca/~german/PAA/Volhynians.htm The Germans from Volhynia and Russian Poland]&lt;/ref&gt; Their migration began at the encouragement of local noblemen, often Polish landlords, who wanted to develop their significant land-holdings in the area. Probably 75% or more of them originated from Congress Poland, with the balance coming directly from other regions such as East and West Prussia, Pomerania, Posen, Württemberg, and Galicia among others. Although the noblemen themselves offered certain perks for the move, the Germans of Volhynia received none of the special tax and military service freedoms granted to the Germans in other areas.

The settlement started as a trickle shortly after 1800. A surge occurred after the first [[November Uprising|Polish rebellion of 1831]] but by 1850, they were still only about 5000 in number. The largest migration came after the second [[January Uprising|Polish rebellion of 1863]] when they began to flood into the area by the thousands until they reached their peak at about 200,000 in the year 1900. The vast majority of these Germans were of the Lutheran (in Europe they were referred to as Evangelicals) faith. Limited numbers of Mennonites from the lower Vistula River region settled in the south part of Volhynia, while Baptists and Moravian Brethren also arrived, mostly settling northwest of [[Zhitomir]]. Another major difference between the Germans here and in other parts of Russia is that the other Germans tended to settle in larger communities. The Germans in Volhynia were scattered about in over 1400 villages. Though the population peaked in 1900, many Germans had already begun leaving Volhynia in the late 1880s for North and South America.

Between 1911 and 1915 a small group of Volhynian German farmers (36 families - more than 200 people) chose instead to move to Eastern Siberia, making use of the resettlement subsidies of the [[Stolypin reform]] of 1906-1911. They settled in three villages (Pikhtinsk, Sredne-Pikhtinsk, and Dagnik) in what is today [[Zalarinsky District]] of [[Irkutsk Oblast]], where they became known as the "Bug Hollanders". They apparently were not using German any more, but rather spoke Ukrainian and Polish, and used [[Lutheran]] [[Bible]]s that had been printed in [[East Prussia]], in [[Polish language|Polish]], but in [[fraktur]]. Their descendants, still bearing German names, continue to live in the district into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;

===Caucasus Germans===
{{main article|Caucasus Germans}}
A German minority of about 100,000 people existed in the [[Caucasus]] region, in areas such as the [[North Caucasus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Azerbaijan]]. In 1941 [[Joseph Stalin]] ordered all inhabitants with a German father to be deported, mostly to [[Siberia]] or [[Kazakhstan]].

==Decline of the Russian Germans==
{{see also|Soviet–German relations before 1941#Volksdeutsche in the Soviet Union}}
The decline of the Russian German community started with the reforms of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. In 1871, he repealed the open-door immigration policy of his ancestors, effectively ending any new German immigration into the Empire. Although the German colonies continued to expand, they were driven by natural growth and by the immigration of Germans from Poland.

The Russian nationalism that took root under Alexander II served as a justification for eliminating in 1871 the bulk of the tax privileges enjoyed by Russian Germans, and after 1874 they were subjected to military service. Only after long negotiations, Mennonites, traditionally a pacifist denomination, were allowed to serve alternative service in the form of work in [[Forestry service (Russia)|forestry]] and the medical corps. The resulting disaffection motivated many Russian Germans, especially members of traditionally dissenting churches, to migrate to the United States and Canada, while many Catholics chose Brazil and Argentina. They moved primarily to the American [[Great Plains]] and western Canada, especially [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Nebraska]], [[Kansas]], and [[Colorado]]; to Canada [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Alberta]]; to Brazil, especially [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]; and to Argentina, especially South of [[Buenos Aires Province]], [[Entre Ríos Province]] and [[La Pampa Province]]. North Dakota and South Dakota attracted primarily Odessa (Black Sea area) Germans from Russia while Nebraska and Kansas attracted mainly Volga Germans from Russia. The majority of Volhynia Germans chose Canada as their destination with significant numbers later migrating to the United States. Smaller settlement pockets also occurred in other regions such as Volga and Volhynian Germans in southwestern Michigan, Volhynian Germans in Wisconsin, and Congress Poland and Volhynian Germans in Connecticut.

After 1881, Russian Germans were required to study [[Russian language|Russian]] in school and lost all their remaining special privileges. Many Germans remained in Russia, particularly those who had done well as Russia began to industrialise in the late 19th century. Russian Germans were disproportionately represented among Russia's engineers, technical tradesmen, industrialists, financiers and large land owners.

[[World War I]] was the first time Russia went to war against Germany since the [[Napoleonic era]], and Russian Germans were quickly suspected of having enemy sympathies. The Germans living in the [[Volhynia]] area were deported to the German colonies in the lower [[Volga river]] in 1915 when Russia started losing the war. Many Russian Germans were exiled to [[Siberia]] by the Tsar's government as enemies of the state - generally without trial or evidence. In 1916, an order was issued to deport the Volga Germans to the east as well, but the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] prevented this from being carried out.

The loyalties of Russian Germans during the revolution varied. While many supported the royalist forces and joined the [[White Army]], others were committed to [[Alexander Kerensky]]'s [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], to the [[Bolshevik]]s, and even to smaller forces like [[Nestor Makhno]]'s. Russian Germans - including Mennonites and [[Evangelical Christians|Evangelicals]] - fought on all sides in the Russian Revolution and [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]]. Although some Russian Germans were very wealthy, others were quite poor and sympathised strongly with their Slavic neighbours. Educated Russian Germans were just as likely to have leftist and revolutionary sympathies as the ethnically Russian intelligentsia.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-037542, Westpreußen, Russlanddeutsche Flüchtlinge.jpg|thumb|1920, a German peasant couple from the Volga region in the refugee camp [[Schneidemühl]], [[Posen-West Prussia]] (now [[Piła]], Poland).]]
In the chaos of the Russian Revolution and the civil war that followed it, many ethnic Germans were displaced within Russia or emigrated from Russia altogether. The chaos surrounding the Russian Civil War was devastating to many German communities, particularly to religious dissenters like the Mennonites. Many Mennonites hold the forces of Nestor Makhno in Ukraine particularly responsible for large-scale violence against their community.

This period was also one of regular food shortages, caused by famine and the lack of long distance transportation of food during the fighting. Coupled with the [[typhus]] epidemic and [[Russian famine of 1921|famine]] of the early 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/131043 The Volga Germans and the Famine of 1921]&lt;/ref&gt; as many as a third of Russia's Germans may have perished. Russian German organisations in the Americas, particularly the [[Mennonite Central Committee]], organised famine relief in Russia in the late 1920s. As the chaos faded and the [[Soviet Union]]'s position became more secure, many Russian Germans simply took advantage of the end of the fighting to emigrate to the Americas. Emigration from the Soviet Union came to a halt in 1929 by Stalin's decree, leaving roughly one million Russian Germans within Soviet borders.

The Soviet Union seized the farms and businesses of Russian Germans, along with all other farms and businesses, when Stalin ended [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]] in 1929 and began the forced [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivization of agriculture]] and liquidation of large land holdings.

[[File:Volga German03.png|thumb|250px|left|Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, 1924-1941]]
Nonetheless, [[Korenizatsiya|Soviet nationalities policy]] had, to some degree, restored the institutions of Russian Germans in some areas. In July 1924, the [[Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was founded, giving the [[Volga Germans]] some autonomous German language institutions. The [[Lutheran church]], like nearly all religious affiliations in Russia, was ruthlessly suppressed under Stalin. But, for the 600,000-odd Germans living in the Volga German ASSR, German was the language of local officials for the first time since 1881.

As a result of the German invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, Stalin decided to deport
the German Russians to internal exile and forced labor in Siberia and Central Asia. It is evident 
that, at this point, the regime considered national minorities with ethnic ties to foreign states, 
such as Germans, potential fifth columnists. On August 12, 1941, the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party decreed the expulsion of the Volga Germans, allegedly for treasonous activity, 
from their autonomous republic on the lower Volga. On September 7, 1941, the Volga German 
Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was abolished and about 438,000 Volga Germans were 
deported. In subsequent months, an additional 400,000 ethnic Germans were deported to Siberia
from their other traditional settlements such as Ukraine and the Crimea.

The Soviets were not successful in expelling all German settlers living in the Western and 
Southern Ukraine, however, due to the rapid advance of the Wehrmacht (German Army). The 
secret police, the NKVD, was able to deport only 35% of the ethnic Germans from Ukraine. 
Thus in 1943, the Nazi German census registered 313,000 ethnic Germans living in the occupied 
territories of the Soviet Union. With the Soviet re-conquest, the Wehrmacht evacuated about 
300,000 German Russians and brought them back to the Reich. Because of the provisions of the 
Yalta Agreement, all former Soviet citizens living in Germany at war’s end had to be repatriated, 
most by force. More than 200,000 German Russians were deported, against their will, by the 
Allies and sent to the Gulag . Thus, shortly after the end of the war, more than one million ethnic
Germans from Russia were in special settlements and labor camps in Siberia and Central Asia. It 
is estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 died of starvation, lack of shelter, over-work, and disease 
during the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Merten, Voices from the Gulag, the Oppression of the German Minority in the Soviet Union, (American Historical Society of Germans from Russia, Lincoln, Nebraska,2015){{ISBN|978-0-692-60337-6}}, pp 2,3,166&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 26, 1948, Stalin made the banishment permanent, declaring that Russia's Germans were permanently forbidden from returning to Europe, but this was rescinded after his death in 1953. Many Russian Germans returned to European Russia, but quite a few remained in Soviet Asia.

Although the post-Stalin Soviet state no longer persecuted ethnic Germans as a group, their Soviet republic was not re-founded. Many Germans in Russia largely assimilated and integrated into Russian society. There were some 2 million ethnic Germans in the Soviet Union in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/grhc/order/german_language/stricker.html Germans from Russia Heritage Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705164825/http://www.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/grhc/order/german_language/stricker.html |date=2008-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soviet Census (1989)|Soviet Union census]] revealed in 1989 that 49% of the German minority named German their mother tongue. According to the 1989 Soviet census, 957,518 citizens of German origin, or 6% of total population, lived in
[[Kazakhstan]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=28051 KAZAKHSTAN: Special report on ethnic Germans], IRIN Asia&lt;/ref&gt; and 841,295 Germans lived in Russia including Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/35.htm|title=Russia - Other Ethnic Groups|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Perestroika]] opened the Soviet borders and witnessed the beginnings of a massive emigration of Germans from the Soviet Union. With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], large numbers of Russian Germans took advantage of Germany's liberal [[German Law of Return|law of return]] to leave the harsh conditions of the Soviet [[successor state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egms.de/en/meetings/gmds2005/05gmds163.shtml|title=gms - 50.

The drop in the Russian Federation's German population was smaller, but still significant. A very few Germans returned to one of their ancestral provinces: about 6,000 settled in [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] (former [[East Prussia]]).

==Russian Germans and the Perestrojka==
{{POV section|date=July 2016}}
{{one source|date=July 2016}}
Since migrating to Russia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Germans had adopted many of the Slavic traits and cultures and formed a special group known as "rossiskie nemtsy", or Russian Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Kluter, "People of German Descent in CIS States – Areas of Settlement, Territorial Autonomy and Emigration," [[GeoJournal]], Vol. 31, No. 4 (December 1993): 421.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Russian Germans have become of national interest to Germany and to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).&lt;ref name="Kluter, 419"&gt;Kluter, 419.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ethnic Germans were no longer persecuted, their pre-Bolshevik lives and villages were not re-founded. Many Germans integrated into Soviet society where they now continue to live. The displaced Germans are unable to return to their ancestral lands in the Volga River Valley or the Black Sea regions, because in many instances, those villages no longer exist after being destroyed during Stalin's regime. In 1990, approximately 45,000 Russian Germans, or 6% of the population, lived in the former German Volga Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Kluter, 425.&lt;/ref&gt; During the late twentieth century, three-quarters of Russian Germans were living in Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tadzhikistan and Uzbekistan), South-West Siberia and Southern Urals.&lt;ref name="Kluter, 421"&gt;Kluter, 421.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Starting in the 1970s, a push-pull effect began that would influence where Russian Germans would eventually live. Because of a bad economy, tensions increased between autochthonous groups and recently settled ethnic minorities living in Central Asia.&lt;ref name="Kluter, 423"&gt;Kluter, 423.&lt;/ref&gt; This strain worsened after the Afghanistan War began in 1979.&lt;ref name="Kluter, 423"/&gt; Germans and other Europeans felt culturally and economically pressured to leave these countries, and moved to the Russian Republic. This migration continued into the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Kluter, 423"/&gt;   
 
During Perestroika in the 1980s, the Soviet borders were opened and the beginnings of a massive migration of Germans from the Soviet Union occurred. Entire families, and even villages, would leave their homes and relocate together in Germany or Austria.&lt;ref name="Kluter, 423"/&gt; This was because they needed to show the German Embassy certain documents, such as a family Bible, as proof that their ancestors were originally from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kluter 428.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant if a family member stayed in the Soviet Union, but then decided to leave later, they would be unable to because they would no longer have the necessary paperwork. Also, Russian German villages were pretty much self-sustaining so if an individual that was necessary for that community, such as a teacher, mechanic or blacksmith left, then the entire village might disappear because it was hard to find a replacement for these vital community members.&lt;ref name="Kluter, 428"&gt;Kluter, 428.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Legal and economic pull factors contributed to Russian Germans decision to move to Germany. They were given special legal status of ''Aussiedler'' (exiles from former German territories or of German descent) which gave them instant German citizenship, the right to vote, unlimited work permit, the flight from Moscow to Frankfurt (with all of their personal belongings and household possessions), job training, and unemployment benefits for three years.&lt;ref&gt;Kluter, 429.&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
Russian Germans from South-West Siberia received a completely different treatment than the Germans living in Central Asia.{{why?|date=July 2016}} Local authorities were persuading Germans to stay by creating two self-governing districts.&lt;ref name="Kluter, 419"/&gt;{{dubious|date=July 2016}}

The All-Union Society ''Wiedergeburt'' (Renaissance) was founded in 1989 to encourage Russian Germans to move back to, and restore the Volga Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Kluter, 424.&lt;/ref&gt; This plan was not successful because Germany interfered with the discussions and created diplomatic friction, which resulted in Russian opposition to this project.{{dubious|date=July 2016}}{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} A couple of those problems were the two sides could not put aside their differences and agree on certain principles such as the meaning of the word "rehabilitation".&lt;ref&gt;Kluter, 419, 427.&lt;/ref&gt; They also neglected the economic reasons why Russia wanted to entice Russian Germans back to the Volga. In 1992, Russian Germans and Russian officials finally agreed on a plan, but Germany did not approve it.&lt;ref name="Kluter, 427"&gt;Kluter, 427.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
On 21 February 1992, Boris Yeltsin, President of the Russian Federation, signed a German-Russian Federation agreement with Germany to restore citizenship to Russian Germans.&lt;ref&gt;"Germany-Russian Federation: Protocol of Collaboration on the Gradual Restoration of Citizenship to Russian Germans, with Decree of the Russian Federation," International Legal Materials, Vol. 31, No. 6 (November 1992): 1301, 1302&lt;/ref&gt; This Federal Program intended to gradually restore the homeland of Russian Germans, and their descendants, in the former Republic of Volga, thus encouraging Russian Germans to immigrate back to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;"Germany-Russian Federation:" 1301.&lt;/ref&gt; It would also guarantee the national and cultural identity of Russian Germans would be preserved, such as their culture, language and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Björn Arp, International Norms and Standards for the Protection of National Minorities: Bilateral and Multilateral Texts for Commentary, (Leiden, Boston, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2008), 288. "Germany-Russian Federation:" 1301.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it would not block or regulate their right to leave if they decide to do so at a later point.&lt;ref name="Arp, 288"&gt;Arp, 288.&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
Events for a separate territory proceeded differently in Siberia, because financially stable Russian German settlements already existed. Siberian officials were economically driven to keep their skilled Russian German citizens and not see them leave for other republics or countries.&lt;ref name="Kluter, 427"/&gt; In the late 1980s, 8.1% of Russian Germans lived in the county of Altay in South-West Siberia and they controlled one-third of profitable farms.&lt;ref&gt;Kluter, 422&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1990, a few ideas offered to the Officer of Exiles (the bureau in charge of emigrants after arriving in Germany) in order to retain Russian Germans, or to promote their return included the suggestion that the necessary important village specialists (mechanics, teachers, doctors, etc.) should be offered incentives such as Trade Associations and additional training in order to keep, or to attract them to Russia. Russian German schools and universities should also be reopened. A third idea is to establish a financial institution that would motivate individuals to buy homes, and start farms or small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Kluter, 433, 434.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, proposed initiatives have not gained traction and have not been instituted due to corruption, incompetency and inexperience.&lt;ref&gt;Kluter, 431 - 433.&lt;/ref&gt; The Association for Germans Abroad (VDA) contracted with the business Inkoplan, to move families from Central Asia at vastly inflated costs. This resulted in VDA and Inkoplan personnel pocketing the difference.&lt;ref name="Kluter, 431"&gt;Kluter, 431.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of incompetency and inexperience included: VDA falsely projected the idea all Russian Germans wanted to leave their present homes and lives and move to the Volga region where they would start over.&lt;ref name="Kluter, 431"/&gt; The Home Office was not fluent in the Russian language or familiar with foreign cultures abroad and this created many misunderstandings between various groups.&lt;ref&gt;Kluter, 432.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these actions by the Home Office, the migration back to Germany continues. Over 140,000 individuals migrated to Germany from CIS in 1990 and 1991, and almost 200,000 people migrated in 1992.&lt;ref name="Kluter, 428"/&gt;

[[File:Ареал расселения немцев в России. По данным Всероссийской переписи населения 2010 года.png|thumb|Areas inhabited by the Germans in Russia according to the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 federal census]]]]
In the [[Demography of Russia|2010 Russian census]], 394,138 Germans were enumerated, down from 597,212 in 2002, making Germans the 20th largest ethnic group in Russia. There are approximately 300,000 Germans living in Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Russia-Eurasia-China/Siberian-Germans-Orientation.html|title=Orientation - Siberian Germans|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Russian Census (2002)|same census]] found that there are 2.9 million citizens who understand the German language (although many of these are ethnic Russians or [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]-speaking Jews who had learned the language). Prominent ethnic Germans in modern Russia include [[Viktor Kress]], governor of [[Tomsk Oblast]] since 1991 and [[German Gref]]&lt;ref&gt;As transliterated from Russian, in German, his name would probably be written as Hermann Graef.&lt;/ref&gt; Minister of Economics and Trade of Russia since 2000. Out of the 597,212 Germans enumerated in 2002, 68% lived in Asian federal districts and 32% lived in European federal districts. The Siberian Federal District, at 308,727 had the largest ethnic German population. But even in this federal district, they formed only 1.54% of the total population. The federal subjects with largest ethnic German populations were Altay Krai (79,502), Omsk Oblast (76,334), Novosibirsk (47,275), Kemerovo (35,965), Chelyabinsk (28,457), Tyumen (27,196), Sverdlovsk (22,540), Krasnodar (18,469), Orenburg (18,055), Volgograd (17,051), Tomsk (13,444), Saratov (12,093) and Perm Krai (10,152).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/English/4-2.xls |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217070612/http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/English/4-2.xls |archivedate=2007-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although emigration to Germany is no longer common, and some Germans move from Kazakhstan to Russia, the number of Germans in Russia continues to fall, mainly due to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] with the majority Russians as younger Germans marry Russians and count their children in the census as Russian.
 
Another indication of assimilation is the fact that Russian Orthodoxy has become the largest faith among Russian Germans, and Lutheranism has largely been abandoned. According to a recent survey, 18% of Russian Germans consider themselves Russian Orthodox, 7.2% Catholic, and only 3.2% mainline Protestant (presumably Lutheran). Also, 34% are unaffiliated, 18% are atheist, 5% generic Christian, 2% other Orthodox, 2% neopagan, and 1.2% Pentecostal.&lt;ref name="sreda.org"/&gt;

In 2011, the [[Kaluga Oblast]] included ethnic Germans living in the former republics of USSR, under the federal program for the return of compatriots to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regnum.ru/news/polit/1446276.html?forprint|title=Калужская область готова принять немцев, переселившихся из стран СНГ|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1989 census there were 100,309 Germans living in [[Kyrgyzstan]]. According to the most recent census data (1999), there were 21,472 Germans in Kyrgyzstan. The German population in [[Tajikistan]] was 38,853 in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jpohl.blogspot.com/2007/03/russian-germans-in-tajikistan.html|title=Otto's Random Thoughts|author=J. Otto Pohl|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, there are an estimated [[Russians in Germany|2.3 million German Russians]], who have established one of the largest [[Russian language|Russian-speaking]] communities outside of the former Soviet Union along with [[Russian language in Israel|Israel]]'s.

==Germans in the Baltics==
{{main article|Baltic German}}

The German presence on the eastern shores of the [[Baltic Sea]] dates back to the [[Middle Ages]] when traders and missionaries started arriving from central Europe. The German-speaking [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] conquered most of what is now [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] (the former [[Livonia]]) in the early 13th century. In 1237, the Brothers of the Sword were incorporated into the [[Teutonic Knights]].

During [[Peter the Great]]'s rule Russia gained control over much of the Baltics from Sweden in the [[Great Northern War]] at the beginning of the 18th century, but left the German nobility in control. Until the Russification policies of the 1880s, the German community and its institutions were intact and protected under the [[Russian Empire]]. The Baltic German nobility were very influential in the [[Tsar of Russia|Russian Tsar's]] army and administration.

The reforms of [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] replaced many of the traditional privileges of the German nobility with elected local governments and more uniform tax codes. Schools were required to teach Russian, and the Russian nationalist press began targeting segregated Germans as unpatriotic and insufficiently Russian. Baltic Germans were also the target of Estonian and Latvian nationalist movements.

In late 1939 (''after'' the start of the Second World War), the entire remaining Baltic German community was repatriated by [[Adolf Hitler]] to areas Nazi Germany had invaded in western Poland (especially in the [[Warthegau]]). The "legal" basis for this was agreed in the August 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and the subsequent [[Nazi–Soviet population transfers]] which had given the [[Soviet Union]] a green light to invade and annex Latvia and Estonia in 1940.

Only a handful of Baltic Germans remained under Soviet rule after 1945 mainly among those few who refused Germany's call to leave the Baltics.

The Jewish community has a long history in [[Singapore]], dating back to the 1800s, and is currently a significant minority population in the country.

== History ==
=== Colonial era ===
The first wave of Jewish immigration to Singapore were Jews of [[Baghdadi Jew|Baghdadi origin]]. The Baghdadi Trade Diaspora occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries and was at its peak in 1817 due to the rule of Ottoman governor [[Dawud Pasha of Baghdad]], who persecuted Jews during his 15-year rule. The first Jewish people to live in Singapore were the Baghdadi traders who were trading between the then-British ports of [[Calcutta]] and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geni.com/projects/Origins-of-the-Baghdadi-Trade-Diaspora/12486&lt;/ref&gt; These settlers spoke [[Arabic]] and after arriving in Singapore, adopted the [[Malay language]], then the main language used in Singapore. Approximately 180 descendants of these Jews still exist, which the Rabbi of Singapore, Rabbi Mordechai Abergel, described as the only remaining indigenous Jews of Asia.&lt;ref name="straitstimes.com"&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/crown-jewel-of-jewish-community-to-open-early-next-year&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841, three Jews, Joseph Dwek Cohen, Nassim Joseph Ezra and Ezra Ezekiel were given a land lease to build a synagogue in a small shop house at [[Boat Quay]]. The synagogue was the inspiration of the name of Synagogue Street.&lt;ref name="mothership.sg"&gt;http://mothership.sg/2014/11/7-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-jews-in-singapore/&lt;/ref&gt;

Synagogue Street was in the first Jewish quarter in Singapore, bordered by Wilkie Road, Mount Sophia Road, Bras Basah Road and Middle Road, which the Jewish called "mahallah" (meaning ‘place’ in Arabic), and was the gathering place for the Jewish community in Singapore.&lt;ref name="mothership.sg"/&gt; The local Jewish community also had a ''[[minhag]]'' that allowed for traveling to synagogue on [[Shabbat]] via [[rickshaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Singapore |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/singapore |publisher=[[The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot]] |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When [[Manasseh Meyer]] returned to Singapore in 1873, he found the synagogue in Synagogue Street in a deplorable state and set about planning a new one for the Jewish community. Jewish community leaders sold off the old synagogue to the government and bought new land for a new synagogue along [[Waterloo Street]], then called Church Street because of the presence of the [[St Peter and St Paul's Church, Singapore|Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul]] nearby. The Jewish community soon began moving into the surrounding areas of [[Dhoby Ghaut]], [[Waterloo Street]], Prinsep Street, Selegie Road and Wilkie Road. Today, several Jewish buildings still exist in the area.

Construction of [[Maghain Aboth Synagogue]], began soon after the community was given the land, and was completed in 1878. A [[water well|well]] was sunk for use as a ''[[mikvah]]'' ([[ritual]] [[bathing|bath]]). The [[consecration]] service was held on 4 April 1878 and conducted by either Lucunas or I.J. Hayeem or both men. In 1924, extensions were made to the building.

Over the years, as Jewish immigration to Singapore increased, the Maghain Aboth Synagogue began to become overcrowded during services. Because of friction between the [[Sephardi Jew|Sephardic]] and Ashkenazi communities over how the services should be carried out, Sir Manasseh Meyer decided to build a new synagogue which was completed in 1905, the [[Chesed-El Synagogue]].

By 1931, the population had grown to 832, according to a census record that the 832 Jews and larger number of Arab residents were the largest house property owners in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Corfield, Justin and Corfield, Robin, ''Encyclopedia of Singapore'', Scarecrow Press; 200; {{ISBN|0-8108-5347-7}}; 279 pages. pp. 118-119&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japanese occupation ===
By 1942, the same year the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]] started, the Jewish population had grown to a high of 1,500. During the occupation, many Jewish settlers were taken to [[POW camp]]s located at [[Changi Prison]] and Sime Road. In the camp, the Jewish settlers were allowed to keep a [[Kosher foods|kosher]] kitchen.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/kosher-kitchen-gave-hope-during-wwii&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-war ===
After [[World War II]] ended, there was an exodus of Jews to Western countries such as [[Israel]], [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. As a result, the community dropped to approximately 450 in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;Corfield, Justin and Corfield, Robin, ''Encyclopedia of Singapore'', Scarecrow Press: 2006; {{ISBN|0-8108-5347-7}}; 279 pages. pp. 118-119&lt;/ref&gt; even falling as low as 180 sometime in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

=== Recent history ===
From the late 1980s, the Jewish community started growing due to increased economic development and a large [[Ashkenazi Jew|Ashkenazi]] immigration rate to Singapore and as of 2015, the community had grown to a historic high of 2,500.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

==Demographics==
As of 2015, there are 2,500 Jews in Singapore, many of whom are recent [[Ashkenazi Jew|Ashkenazi]] migrants. Approximately 180 descendants of the "first wave" Jews, who are mostly [[Orthodox Jews|orthodox]], still exist, which the Rabbi of Singapore, Rabbi Mordechai Abergel, described as the only remaining indigenous Jews of Asia.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

==Notable people==

=== David Marshall ===
One of the most well-known Jews in the history of Singapore is [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]] (1908-1995). He was the first chief minister of Singapore in 1955, serving for 14 months while being leader of the [[Labour Front]]. He also led the first Merdeka Talks to [[London]] in hope for gaining independence from the British but resigned after failing to gain independence from the British. Following his resignation, in 1957, he founded the [[Workers Party of Singapore]], which is currently Singapore's second largest political party.

In his later life, he served as Singapore's ambassador to [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Spain]], and [[Portugal]]. He died in 1995 of [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;Abadi, Yakob, ''Israel's Quest for Recognition and Acceptance in Asia: Garrison State Diplomacy'': Routledge: 2004; {{ISBN|0-7146-5576-7}}; 478 pages, pp. 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sir Manasseh Meyer ===
Sir [[Manasseh Meyer]] (1843–1930) was a British businessman and philanthropist who was a benefactor to the Jewish community in Singapore.

Chesed-El was built for the use of his family and others.

Together with three other wealthy Jews, Meyer bought a large piece of land in Moulmein Road for $5,407.12 for the Jewish Cemetery. Meyer also bought the adjoining piece of land for $8,681.40 and, after reserving a plot for himself and his second wife, Rebecca, presented it to the community. His wife Rebecca died in 1915.

In 1928, he donated $150,000 to the University of Malaya in Singapore (now the [[National University of Singapore]]), to build its science building, which has become a Singaporean national monument. Britain's [[King George V]] knighted him in 1929 after he donated $20,000 to the British military effort in World War I. Meyer Road in Singapore is named after him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jewish-contributions-to-singapore&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its membership size, the UHC operates as a synagogue without walls - services and events are held at various sites around the city.  As of 2014, the UHC supports a weekly Jewish Religious School.  The UHC and its members are dedicated to the Reform Jewish notion of [[Tikkun Olam]], and have been engaged in various local and global fundraising and community service efforts.

[[Image:Irishcrownjewels.jpg|thumb|250px|The Irish Crown Jewels. This image was published by the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] and the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]] twice a week after the theft of the jewels was discovered.]]

The '''Jewels Belonging to the Most Illustrious Order of Saint Patrick''', commonly called the '''Irish Crown Jewels''' or '''State Jewels of Ireland''', were the heavily jewelled star and badge [[regalia]] of the Sovereign and Grand Master of the [[Order of St. Patrick]]. They were stolen from [[Dublin Castle]] in 1907 along with the [[Collar (Order of Knighthood)|collar]]s of five knights of the Order. The theft has never been solved and the jewels have never been recovered.&lt;ref&gt;https://britishheritage.com/who-pinched-the-irish-crown-jewels-augustseptember-1999-british-heritage-feature/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Lord Dudley, Grand Master of the Order of St. Patrick.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley|The 2nd Earl of Dudley]] ([[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], 1902–1905) wearing the Irish Crown Jewels as ''ex officio'' Grand Master of the [[Order of St Patrick]].]]
The [[Order of St Patrick]] is an [[order of knighthood]] established in 1783 by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] as [[King of Ireland]] to be an Irish equivalent of the English [[Order of the Garter]] and the Scottish [[Order of the Thistle]]. The British monarch, as monarch first of Ireland and later [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|of the United Kingdom]], was the Sovereign of the Order; and the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] was the Grand Master in the absence of the Sovereign. The insignia were worn by the Sovereign at the investiture of new Knights as members of the Order, and by the Grand Master on other formal ceremonial occasions.

The original regalia of the Sovereign were only slightly more opulent than the insignia of an ordinary Knight Member of the Order. These were replaced in 1831 by new ones presented by [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] as part of a revision of the Order's structure, and containing 394 precious stones taken from the [[English Crown Jewels]] of [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]] and the [[Order of the Bath]] star of her husband George III.&lt;ref name="Riordan2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Riordan|first=Tomás|date=Winter 2001|title=The Theft of the Irish Crown Jewels, 1907|journal=History Ireland|volume=9|issue=4|url=http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-theft-of-the-irish-crown-jewels-1907/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jewels were assembled by [[Rundell &amp; Bridge]]. On the badge of [[Saint Patrick's blue]] enamel, the green [[shamrock]] was of [[emerald]]s and the red [[Saint Patrick's Saltire]] of [[ruby|rubies]]; the motto of the Order was in [[Diamond color|pink diamond]]s and the encrustation was of Brazilian diamonds of the [[first water]].&lt;ref name="Riordan2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalarchives"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/digital-resources/online-exhibitions/the-theft-of-the-irish-%E2%80%9Ccrown-jewels%E2%80%9D-2007/ |title=The Theft of the Irish 'Crown Jewels' |work=Online exhibitions |date=2007 |accessdate=15 June 2013 |publisher=[[National Archives of Ireland]] |location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notices issued after the theft described the jewels thus:

}}

When not being worn or cleaned, the insignia of the Sovereign and those of deceased Knights were in the custody of the [[Ulster King of Arms]], the senior Irish [[officer of arms]], and kept in a [[bank vault]].&lt;ref name="dublincastle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincastle.ie/HistoryEducation/History/Chapter12TheIllustriousOrderofStPatrick/|title=Chapter 12: The Illustrious Order of St. Patrick|work=History of Dublin Castle|publisher=[[Office of Public Works]]|accessdate=14 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511112016/http://www.dublincastle.ie/HistoryEducation/History/Chapter12TheIllustriousOrderofStPatrick/|archivedate=11 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designation "Crown Jewels" was first applied to the star and badge regalia of the Sovereign in a 1905 revision of the Order's statutes. The label "Irish Crown Jewels" was publicised by newspapers after their theft.&lt;ref name="Galloway1983"&gt;{{cite book |last=Galloway |first=Peter |title=The Most Illustrious Order of St. Patrick: 1783 – 1983 |year=1983 |publisher=Phillimore |isbn=9780850335088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theft==
In 1903, the jewels were transferred to a [[safe]], which was to be placed in the newly constructed [[strongroom]] in [[Dublin Castle]] beside the Ulster King of Arms' office. The new safe was too large for the doorway to the strongroom, and [[Sir Arthur Vicars]], the [[Ulster King of Arms]], instead stored it in his office. Seven latch keys to the door of the Office of Arms were held by Vicars and his staff, and two keys to the safe containing the insignia were both in the custody of Vicars. Vicars was known to regularly get drunk on overnight duty and he once awoke to find the jewels around his neck.  It is not known whether or not this was a prank or a practice for the actual theft.

The insignia were last worn by the Lord Lieutenant, [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|The 7th Earl of Aberdeen]], on 15 March 1907, at a function to mark [[Saint Patrick's Day]] on 17 March. They were last known to be in the safe on 11 June, when Vicars showed them to a visitor to his office. The jewels were discovered to be missing on 6 July 1907, four days before the start of a visit by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]] to the [[Irish International Exhibition]], at which it was planned to invest [[Bernard FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown|The 2nd Baron Castletown]] into the Order. The theft is reported to have angered the King, but the visit went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;Legge 1913, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; However, the investiture ceremony was cancelled.&lt;ref name="dublincastle" /&gt; Also stolen were the [[Collar (Order of Knighthood)|collar]]s of five Knight Members of the Order: four living (the [[James Edward William Theobald Butler, 3rd Marquess of Ormonde|Marquess of Ormonde]] and Earls [[William Ulick Tristram St Lawrence, 4th Earl of Howth|of Howth]], [[Lowry Cole, 4th Earl of Enniskillen|of Enniskillen]], and [[Dermot Bourke, 7th Earl of Mayo|of Mayo]]) and one deceased ([[Richard Boyle, 9th Earl of Cork|The 9th Earl of Cork]]).&lt;ref name="csorp18119"/&gt; These were valued at £1,050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/digital-resources/online-exhibitions/the-theft-of-the-irish-%E2%80%9Ccrown-jewels%E2%80%9D-2007/photo-gallery/dmp3/|title=DMP – poster 3|year=2007|publisher=National Archives of Ireland|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation===
[[File: Irish Crown Jewels.jpg|thumb|right|Dublin Police notice of theft of crown jewels.]]
A police investigation was conducted by the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]] (DMP).&lt;ref name="csorp18119"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/digital-resources/online-exhibitions/the-theft-of-the-irish-%E2%80%9Ccrown-jewels%E2%80%9D-2007/photo-gallery/8-a/|title=CSORP/1913/18119 – page 1|publisher=National Archives of Ireland|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posters issued by the DMP depicted and described the missing jewels. Detective Chief Inspector John Kane of [[Scotland Yard]] arrived on 12 July to assist.&lt;ref name="nationalarchives"/&gt; His report, never released, is said to have named the culprit and to have been suppressed by the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC).&lt;ref name="nationalarchives"/&gt; Vicars refused to resign his position, and similarly refused to appear at a Viceregal Commission into the theft held from 10 January 1908. Vicars argued for a public [[Royal Commission]] instead, which would have had power to [[subpoena]] [[witness]]es. He publicly accused his second in command, Francis Shackleton, of the theft. Kane explicitly denied to the Commission that Shackleton, brother of the explorer [[Ernest Shackleton]], was involved. Shackleton was exonerated in the Commission's report, and Vicars was found to have "not exercise[d] due vigilance or proper care as the custodian of the regalia." Vicars was compelled to resign, as were all the staff in his personal employ.

===Rumours and theories===
In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in August 1907, [[Pat O'Brien (Irish politician)|Pat O'Brien]], [[Members of Parliament|MP]] blamed "loyal and patriotic [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] criminals".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1907/aug/13/the-theft-of-the-irish-crown-jewels HC Deb 13 August 1907 vol 180 cc1065-6]&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Lord Haddo]], the son of the Lord Lieutenant, was alleged by some newspapers to have been involved in the theft;&lt;ref&gt;Legge 1913, pp. xv, 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine Birrell]], the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], stated in the Commons that Haddo had been in [[Great Britain]] throughout the time period within which the theft took place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1908/apr/01/the-theft-of-the-dublin-crown-jewels HC Deb 01 April 1908 vol 187 cc509-10]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 and 1913 [[Laurence Ginnell]] suggested that the police investigation had established the identity of the thief, that his report had been suppressed to avoid scandal,&lt;ref name="hc1913v47c1189"&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1913/jan/28/crown-jewels-ireland HC Deb 28 January 1913 vol 47 cc1189-90]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the jewels were "at present within the reach of the Irish Government awaiting the invention of some plausible method of restoring them without getting entangled in the Criminal Law".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1913/jan/23/crown-jewels-ireland HC Deb 23 January 1913 vol 47 cc589-90]&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[adjournment debate]] in 1912 he alleged:&lt;ref name="hc1912v44c2751"&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1912/dec/06/irish-crown-jewels HC Deb 06 December 1912 vol 44 cc2751-2]&lt;/ref&gt;
:The police charged with collecting evidence in connection with the disappearance of the Crown Jewels from Dublin Castle in 1907 collected evidence inseparable from it of criminal debauchery and sodomy being committed in the castle by officials, Army officers, and a couple of nondescripts of such position that their conviction and exposure would have led to an upheaval from which the Chief Secretary shrank. To prevent that, he suspended the operation of the Criminal Law, and appointed a whitewashing commission with the result for which it was appointed.
His speech was curtailed when a [[quorum]] of forty MPs was not present in the chamber.&lt;ref name="hc1912v44c2751" /&gt; He elaborated the following week on the alleged depravity of "two of the characters", namely army captain [[Richard William Howard Gorges|Richard Gorges]] ("a reckless bully, a robber, a murderer, a bugger, and a sod") and Shackleton ("One of [Gorges'] chums in the Castle, and a participant in the debauchery").&lt;ref name="hc19121220"/&gt; Birrell denied any cover-up and urged Ginnell to give to the police any evidence he had relating to the theft or any sexual crime.&lt;ref name="hc19121220"&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1912/dec/20/crown-jewels-dublin HC Deb 20 December 1912 vol 45 cc1955-62]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Vavasour Faber]] also asked about a cover-up;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1913/feb/13/crown-jewels-dublin HC Deb 13 February 1913 vol 48 cc1159-61]&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Legge supported this theory.&lt;ref&gt;Legge 1913, pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;

After Francis Shackleton was imprisoned in 1914 for passing a [[cheque]] stolen from a widow,&lt;ref name="dublincastle" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=AS19130308.2.108.5&amp;dliv=&amp;e=--1913---1914--10--1-byDA---0surrey+shipping+arrivals--|title=The Case of Francis Shackleton|date=8 March 1913|work=Auckland Star|page=13|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Turnour, 6th Earl Winterton|The 6th Earl Winterton]] asked for the [[judicial inquiry]] demanded by Vicars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1914/feb/19/crown-jewels-dublin HC Deb 19 February 1914 vol 58 cc1113-4]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 November 1912, the ''London Mail'' alleged that Vicars had allowed a woman reported to be his mistress to obtain a copy to the key to the safe and that she had fled to Paris with the jewels. In July 1913 Vicars sued the paper for [[libel]]; it admitted that the story was completely baseless and that the woman in question did not exist; Vicars was awarded [[damages]] of £5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Irish Crown Jewels|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=MEX19130829.2.25|accessdate=29 August 2015|issue=Volume XLVII, Issue 20|publisher=Marlborough Express|date=August 29, 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vicars left nothing in his will to his half-brother [[Pierce Charles de Lacy O'Mahony]], on the grounds that Mahony had repudiated a promise to recompense Vicars for the loss of income caused by his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/digital-resources/online-exhibitions/the-theft-of-the-irish-%E2%80%9Ccrown-jewels%E2%80%9D-2007/photo-gallery/will4/|title=Will of Sir Arthur Vicars – page 4|publisher=National Archives of Ireland|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory was that the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB) had smuggled the jewels to the United States.&lt;ref name="Riordan2001" /&gt;

A 1927 memo of the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State]], released in the 1970s, stated that [[W. T. Cosgrave]] "understands that the Castle jewels are for sale and that they could be got for £2,000 or £3,000."&lt;ref name="Riordan2001" /&gt;

In 1968 the Irish journalist [[Bulmer Hobson]] published an account of the theft&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ireland Yesterday and Tomorrow|last = Hobson|first = Bulmer|publisher = Tralee|year = 1968|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which stated that the jewels had been stolen by Shackleton in complicity with [[Captain (British Army)|Captain]] Richard Gorges, after they had plied Vicars with so much whiskey that he had passed out. Hobson claimed the jewels had been taken to [[Amsterdam]] by Shackleton, and pledged for £20,000, with the proviso that they not be broken up for three years. Both men were homosexual, and official fears that a witch-hunt might cause greater scandal (as had the Dublin Castle homosexual scandals of 1884), may have been a reason for the compromising of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Princes Under The Volcano|last = Trevelyan|first = Raleigh|publisher = William Morrow &amp; Company|year = 1978|isbn = |location = |pages = 337–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 Shackleton was charged with defrauding the gay [[Scottish people|Scottish]] nobleman [[Lord Ronald Gower]] of his fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/26866997|title=COLOSSAL FRAUD. LORD RONALD GOWER RUINED. SIR E. SHACKLETON'S BROTHER CHARGED.|date=15 February 1913|newspaper=[[The West Australian]]|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 book suggests the jewels were stolen as a Unionist plot to embarrass [[Liberal Government 1905–1915|the Liberal government]], and later secretly returned to the Royal Family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cafferky |first1=John |last2=Hannafin |first2=Kevin |title=Scandal &amp; betrayal: Shackleton and the Irish crown jewels |year=2002 |publisher=Collins |isbn=9781903464250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fictional accounts===
A 1967 book suggests that the 1908 [[Sherlock Holmes]] story "[[The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans]]" was inspired by the theft; author [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] was a friend of Vicars, and the fictional Valentine Walters, who steals the Plans but is caught by Holmes, has similarities with Francis Shackleton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bamford |first1=Francis |last2=Bankes |first2=Viola |title=Vicious Circle: The Case of the Missing Irish Crown Jewels |year=1967 |publisher=Horizon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jewels'', a Bob Perrin novel based on the theft, was published in 1977.&lt;ref name="Perrin1977"&gt;{{cite book|last=Perrin|first=Robert|title=Jewels|year=1977|publisher=Pan Books|isbn=9780330255875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Case of the Crown Jewels'' by [[Donald Serrell Thomas]], a Sherlock Holmes story based on the theft, was published in 1997.

Havoc was a child [[vaudeville]] performer under the tutelage of her mother [[Rose Thompson Hovick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-june-havoc30-2010mar30,0,691138.story|title=Los Angeles Times obituary|publisher=Latimes.com|date=March 29, 2010|accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later acted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and in Hollywood, and stage-directed, both on and off-Broadway. She last appeared on television in 1990 in a story arc on the [[soap opera]] ''[[General Hospital]]''. Her elder sister Louise gravitated to [[American burlesque|burlesque]] and became the well-known [[Striptease|ecdysiast]] [[Gypsy Rose Lee]].

==Early life==
She was born in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, in 1912, according to the ''Connecticut Death Index, 1949-2012'' (state file #06956). Various reliable sources cite 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ancestrylibrary.com/interactive/9800/004551576_00022/1516993?backlabel=ReturnRecord&amp;backurl=http://search.ancestrylibrary.com//cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv=1&amp;db=FS1BrazilImmigrationCards&amp;h=1516993&amp;tid=&amp;pid=&amp;usePUB=true&amp;_phsrc=YZi2&amp;_phstart=successSource&amp;usePUBJs=true&amp;rhSource=3693&amp;ssrc=|title=Ancestry Library Edition|website=www.ancestrylibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ancestrylibrary.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?_phsrc=YZi2&amp;_phstart=successSource&amp;usePUBJs=true&amp;gss=angs-g&amp;new=1&amp;rank=1&amp;gsfn=June&amp;gsfn_x=0&amp;gsln=Havoc&amp;gsln_x=0&amp;catbucket=rstp&amp;MSAV=0&amp;MSV=0&amp;uidh=57k&amp;pcat=ROOT_CATEGORY&amp;h=86999835&amp;recoff=9+10&amp;dbid=3693&amp;indiv=1&amp;ml_rpos=10|title=Ancestry Library Edition|website=search.ancestrylibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, however, 1916 was cited as her year of birth. Havoc acknowledged in her later years that 1912 was likely the correct year.

She was reportedly uncertain of the year. Her mother forged various birth certificates for both her daughters to evade [[child labor laws]].&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; Her life-long career in show business began when she was a child, billed as "Baby June."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alvin|last=Klein|url=http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?_r=1&amp;res=990CE3DA1739F936A35750C0A963958260&amp;oref=slogin|title=June Havoc, Off Stage|work=The New York Times|date=March 5, 1995|accessdate=May 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her sister, entertainer [[Gypsy Rose Lee]] (born as Rose Louise Hovick), was called "Louise" by her family members. Their parents were Rose Thompson Hovick, of German descent, and John Olaf Hovick (c. 1885-1952), the son of Norwegian immigrants, who worked as an advertising agent and  reporter at ''The Seattle Times''.&lt;ref name="strippinggypsy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Preminger|first=Erik Lee|title=My G-String Mother: At Home and Backstage with Gypsy Rose Lee|year=2004|origyear=1984|publisher=Frog|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-1-58394-096-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZwKTFdIE5sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=My%20G-string%20mother&amp;pg=PA186|authorlink=Erik Lee Preminger|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Vaudeville===
[[File:DaintyJuneAd.jpg|thumb|left|November 13, 1927 ad in ''The Decatur Review'']]
Following their parents' divorce, the two sisters earned the family's income by appearing in [[vaudeville]], where June's talent often overshadowed Louise's. Baby June got an audition with [[Alexander Pantages]] (1876–1936), who had come to [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] in 1902 to build theaters up and down the west coast of the United States. Soon, she was launched in vaudeville and also appeared in Hollywood movies. She could not speak until the age of three, but the films were all silent. She would cry for the cameras when her mother told her that the family's dog had died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Havoc|first=June|title=Early Havoc|year=1959|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|oclc=721747|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1928, Havoc, in an effort to escape her overbearing mother, eloped with Bobby Reed, a boy in the vaudeville act. Weeks later after performing at the Jayhawk Theatre in [[Topeka, Kansas]] on December 29, 1928, Rose reported Reed to the Topeka Police, and he was arrested. Rose had a concealed gun on her when she met Bobby at the police station. She pulled the trigger, but the safety was on. She then physically attacked her soon-to-be new son-in-law, and the police had to pry her off the hapless Reed. June soon married him, leaving both her family and the act. The marriage did not last, but the two remained on friendly terms. June's only child was a daughter, born April Rose Hyde (April 2, c. 1932, New York City {{spaced ndash}} December 28, 1998, [[Paris, France]]). A marriage license, dated November 30, 1928 for Ellen Hovick and Weldon Hyde, would seem to indicate that Bobby Reed's real name was Weldon Hyde.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestrylibrary.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?db=Numident&amp;h=33377992&amp;indiv=try&amp;o_vc=Record:OtherRecord&amp;rhSource=60541 Dates of birth and death of April Kent], familysearch.org; accessed August 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/10/theater/theater-the-real-june-is-still-singing-out.html?pagewanted=|title=The real June is still singing out|publisher=Nytimes.com|date=August 10, 2003|accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; April became an actress in the 1950s known as '''April Kent'''. She predeceased her mother, dying in Paris in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0448655|April Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/138252-June-Havoc-Stage-Star-Whose-Life-Became-Legend-in-Gypsy-Dies-at-96 Obituary for June Havoc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604022252/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/138252-June-Havoc-Stage-Star-Whose-Life-Became-Legend-in-Gypsy-Dies-at-96 |date=June 4, 2010 }}, playbill.com; accessed August 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film and stage===
She adopted the surname of Havoc, a variant of her birth name. She got her first acting break on Broadway in [[Sigmund Romberg]]'s ''Forbidden Melody'' in 1936. She later appeared in [[Richard Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart|Hart]]'s ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' on Broadway. Havoc moved to Hollywood in the late 1940s, and had roles in movies such as ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]''. Havoc and her sister continued to get demands for money and gifts from their mother until her death in 1954.&lt;ref name=beck/&gt;

After their mother's death, the sisters then were free to write about her without risking a lawsuit. Lee's memoir, titled ''Gypsy'', was published in 1957 and was taken as inspirational material for the [[Jule Styne]], [[Stephen Sondheim]], and [[Arthur Laurents]] Broadway musical ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable]]''. Havoc did not like the way she was portrayed in the piece, which became a source of contention between the two, but gave her agreement in her sister's financial interest. Havoc and Lee reportedly were estranged for more than a decade, but reconciled shortly before Lee's death in 1970.&lt;ref name=playbill&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/138252-June-Havoc-Stage-Star-Whose-Life-Became-Legend-in-Gypsy-Dies-at-96|title=June Havoc, Stage Star Whose Life Became Legend in Gypsy, Dies at 96|last=Simpson|first=Robert|date=March 28, 2010|publisher=playbill.com|accessdate=November 16, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604022252/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/138252-June-Havoc-Stage-Star-Whose-Life-Became-Legend-in-Gypsy-Dies-at-96|archivedate=June 4, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Havoc wrote two memoirs, ''Early Havoc'' and ''More Havoc''. She also wrote a play entitled ''Marathon '33'', based on ''Early Havoc'' with elements of ''[[They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (novel)|They Shoot Horses, Don't They?]]'' The play starred [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]], and was directed and choreographed by June Havoc and opened the ANTA Playhouse (now the [[August Wilson Theatre]]) in December 1963, running for 48 performances and receiving four Tony Award nominations.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Alvin (November 6, 1983) [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/06/nyregion/the-lively-arts-theater-bows-with-marathon-33.html?pagewanted=all "The Lively Arts; Theater Bows With 'Marathon'33'"], nytimes.com; retrieved April 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Havoc was married three times. Her first marriage, at age 16, was in December 1928 to Bobby Reed, a boy in her vaudeville act.&lt;ref name=playbill/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aaker, Everett (2013) ''George Raft: The Films''. McFarland, pg. 130; {{ISBN|0786493135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her second marriage was in 1935 was to Donald S. Gibbs; they later divorced. Her third marriage, to radio and television director and producer [[William Spier]] (1906–1973), lasted from January 25, 1948 until his death.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; Havoc's sister [[Gypsy Rose Lee]] died of lung cancer in 1970, aged 59, and is interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery in [[Inglewood, California]].

In the mid-1970s, Havoc purchased an abandoned train depot and various 19th-century buildings in [[Wilton, Connecticut]] called Cannon Crossing. Restoring, rebuilding and repurposing several small buildings from other locations, she worked hands-on and successfully completed this vast restoration project, which remains a popular destination today. It is home to artisan shops, galleries, boutiques, a cafe and a restaurant.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

A long-time resident of Fairfield County (Weston, Wilton and lastly North Stamford) Connecticut, Havoc was fiercely devoted to the care and well-being of animals. Her homes were a nurturing and loving sanctuary to many orphaned geese, donkeys, cats, and dogs over the decades.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Havoc was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and supported [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential election]]&lt;ref&gt;''Motion Picture and Television Magazine'', November 1952, page 33, Ideal Publishers &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Death==
Havoc died at her home in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], on March 28, 2010, from unspecified natural causes. She was believed to be 97 at the time of her death.&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{cite news|title=June Havoc, Vaudeville Star, Is Dead|author=Gates, Anita|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 29, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/theater/30havoc.html|quote=June Havoc ... died on Sunday at her home in Stamford, Conn.

==Honors==
In 1960, Havoc was honored with two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]{{mdash}}one at 6618 Hollywood Boulevard for her contributions to the motion picture industry, and the other at 6413 Hollywood Boulevard for television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/june-havoc|title=June Havoc - Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=www.walkoffame.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/june-havoc June Havoc], L.A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14751">'''LGBT ageing''' addresses issues and concerns related to ageing and minority sexualities or gender identities. Older LGBT* people are marginalised by: a) younger LGBT people, because of [[Ageism|ageism and age discrimination]]; and b) by older age social networks because of [[heteronormativity]] (the assumption that heterosexuality is the norm), [[heterosexism]] (the privileging of heterosexuality), [[biphobia]], [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]] ([[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] towards LGBT people).

== Research overview ==
There has been a growth of interest in [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[Transgender|trans]] (LGBT) [[ageing]] in recent years.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Westwood, S, King, Andy, Almack, Kathy and Suen, Y-T (2015) Good Practice in Health and Social Care Provision for Older LGBT people. In J. Fish and Kate Karban (eds) Social Work and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans Health Inequalities: International Perspectives pp 145-159. Bristol: Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing body of academic literature on the subject from the USA,&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Douglas, Rose, Tara and David, Steven (eds) (2006). Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Ageing. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; the UK,&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Ann (2006). ‘Sexuality in gerontology: A heteronormative presence, a queer absence.’ In S.O. Daatland and S. Biggs (eds) Ageing and Diversity: Multiple Pathways &amp; Cultural Migrations, pp. 107-122. Bristol: Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Jo (2006). ‘Coming Out Ready or Not! Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Ageing and Aged Care in Australia: Reflections, Contemporary Developments and the Road Ahead.’ Gay &amp; Lesbian Issues and Psychology Review, 2(2): 44-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Brotman, Shari, et. al. (2007). ‘Coming Out to Care: Caregivers of Gay and Lesbian Seniors in Canada.’ Gerontologist, 47: 490-503.&lt;/ref&gt; the Netherlands &lt;ref&gt;Fokkema, Tineke and Kuyper, Lisette (2009). ‘The Relation Between Social Embeddedness and Loneliness among Older Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Adults in the Netherlands.’ Archives of Sexual Behavior, 38(2): 264-275.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;GLEN, Gay and Lesbian Equality Network (2011) Visible Lives: Identifying the experiences and needs of older lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Ireland.  Dublin: GLEN.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a number of documents from social policy and/or campaign organisations, particularly in relation to health and social care issues, for example from the Metlife Mature Market Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/mmi-out-aging-lesbian-gay-retirement.pdf|title=Metlife Mature Market Institute, Lesbian and Gay Aging Issues Network of the AmericanSociety on Aging, &amp; Zogby International.

The earliest waves of research sought ‘to challenge the image of the lonely and bitter old queer’ &lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Mark (2006). ‘Queer ageing.’ Gay and Lesbian Issues and Psychology Review, 2(2): 54-59, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; and ‘suggested that older gay men and lesbians are not alone, isolated, or depressed but benefit from navigating a stigmatized identity through crisis competence’,&lt;ref&gt;Fredriksen-Goldsen, Karen I. and Muraco, Anna (2010). ‘Aging and Sexual Orientation: A 25-year review of the literature.’ Research on Aging, 32(3): 372-413, p.402&lt;/ref&gt; which also informs resilience in dealing with [[Gender inequality|inequalities]] associated with older age. Subsequent authors questioned the positive bias which may have been present in some of these initial studies.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Raymond (1996). Gay and Gray: The Older Homosexual Man, Second Edition. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research has focused on [[LGBT health|health]], [[LGBT housing discrimination in the United States|housing]] and [[Social care|social care and support]] needs,&lt;ref&gt;Carr, S. and Ross, P. (2013) Assessing current and future housing and support options for older LGB people. York: Joseph Rowntree Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; older LGBT rights &lt;ref&gt;Knauer, N. (2009). ‘LGBT Elder Law: Toward Equity in Aging.’ Harvard Journal of Law and Gender, 32, 301-358.&lt;/ref&gt;  and also the differences between and among older LGBT* individuals, particularly in relation to [[gender]].&lt;ref&gt;Averett, Paige , Yoon, Intae  and Jenkins, Carol L. (2012). ‘Review of the Literature on Older Lesbians: Implications for Education, Practice, and Research.’ Journal of Applied Gerontology, 31(4): 537-561.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of research on [[Black and minority ethnic|Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME)]] older LGBT* individuals, ageing and bisexuality, issues of [[class (social)|class]] and other [[intersections]].&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Ann, et. al. (2011). ‘Categories and their consequences: Understanding and supporting the caring relationships of older lesbian, gay and bisexual people.’ International Social Work, 54(3): 421-435.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mixosaurus.co.uk/2015/01/where-are-our-elders-2/|title=Where are our elders?|date=29 January 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Informal social support ==

Present cohorts of older lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGBT) people are more likely to be estranged from their biological families, less likely to have children, and thus less likely to have access to [[intergenerational]] social support in later life.&lt;ref&gt;Guasp, A. (2011). Lesbian, gay and bisexual people in later life. London: Stonewall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hsc.12265/abstract Westwood, S. (2015) We See it as Being Heterosexualised, Being Put into a Care Home’: Gender, sexuality and housing/care preferences among older LGBT individuals in the UK. Health and Social Care in the Community] doi: 10.1111/hsc.12265&lt;/ref&gt; They may have strong ‘family of friends’ networks, but as these tend to be formed by people of similar ages, when, in older age, they need increased care and support at around the same time, they are then also less likely to be able to provide it to one another.&lt;ref&gt;Musingarimi, Primrose (2008). Housing Issues Affecting Older Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual People in the UK: A Policy Brief. London: The International Longevity Centre – UK (ILCUK).&lt;/ref&gt; This means that older LGBT people are more likely to need formal social care and support sooner, and in greater numbers, than older [[heterosexual]] people, particularly, for those in [[couple (relationship)|couples]], after a partner has died.&lt;ref&gt;Almack, Kathryn, Seymour, Jane and Bellamy, Gary (2010). ‘Exploring the Impact of Sexual Orientation on Experiences and Concerns about End of Life Care and on Bereavement for Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Older People.’ Sociology, 44(5): 908-924.&lt;/ref&gt; Older trans* people with children, particularly those who have [[transitioning (transgender)|transitioned]] in later life, can experience [[Social rejection|rejection]] from biological families and so even those with children may lack access to intergenerational support.&lt;ref&gt;Cook-Daniels, L. (2006). Trans Ageing. In D. Kimmel, T. Rose and S. David, S. (eds) Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Ageing, pp 20-35. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L, (2012) Trans ageing: thoughts on a life course approach in order to better understand trans lives, in R, Ward, I, Rivers and M, Sutherland (eds) Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender ageing: Biographical approaches for inclusive care and support, pp 51-66. London and Philadelphia, PA: Jessica Kingsley Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Housing and social care ==

Mainstream housing and social care provision ([[Home care|domicilary/home care]], [[Community health centers in the United States|community care]], [[supported housing]], [[Retirement home|retirement]] and [[nursing home]] facilities) is ill-equipped to meet the needs of older LGBT* people.&lt;ref&gt;Addis, S, et. al., 2009, The health, social care and housing needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender older people: A review of the literature, Health and Social Care in the Community, 17(6), 647-658.&lt;/ref&gt; Many older LGBT people currently living in older age accommodation and/or care spaces try to conceal their lives, identities and significant relationships if they can.&lt;ref&gt;Hash, K. M., &amp; Netting, F. E. (2009). It takes a community: Older lesbians meeting social and care needs. Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Social Services, 21(4), 326-342.&lt;/ref&gt; They fear being misunderstood, vulnerable to [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] and/or isolated from their families and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hsc.12265/abstract|title=‘We see it as being heterosexualised, being put into a care home’: gender, sexuality and housing/care preferences among older LGB individuals in the UK|first=Sue|last=Westwood|date=1 November 2016|publisher=|journal=Health &amp; Social Care in the Community|volume=24|issue=6|pages=e155–e163|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1111/hsc.12265}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are especially concerned about care if they develop dementia, in terms of 'coming out to care'&lt;ref&gt;Price, E.

(2015) Dementia, women and sexuality: How the intersection of ageing, gender and sexuality magnify dementia concerns among older lesbian and bisexual women. Dementia: The International Journal of Social Research and Practice, doi: 1471301214564446.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these issues and concerns a range of good practice guidelines have been developed in the USA, for example focussing on cultural competence&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, Tracey, et. al. (2013). ‘Cultural Competence Training for Healthcare Professionals Working with LGBT*\ Older Adults.’ Educational Gerontology 39(6): 454-463.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fredriksen-Goldsen, K.

[[Thomas Clarkson]] (1760 – 1846), the pioneering abolitionist, prepared a "map" of the "streams" of "forerunners and coadjutors" of the abolitionist movement, which he published in his work, ''The History of the Rise, Progress, and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the African Slave-Trade by the British Parliament'' published in 1808.&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson, Thomas. ''The history of the rise, progress, and accomplishment of the abolition of the African slave-trade by the British Parliament''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The map shows streams with various branches that led to the late-eighteenth-century movement that convinced the British Parliament to ban the slave trade. The list below is taken from Clarkson's map.

No women appear to be on the list, although many in fact were involved in the movement including [[Hannah More]], [[Joanna Baillie]], and [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]]. [[James Oglethorpe]] does not appear on the list, even though he and other Georgia Trustees prohibited slavery in the [[Province of Georgia]]. Oglethorpe later collaborated in opposing the slave trade with [[Granville Sharp]], whom Clarkson describes as "the father of the cause in England". Slavery as both a moral and legal concern arose in the early days of the [[Georgia Colony]], which prohibited slavery in 1735 and was challenged by neighboring South Carolina, a slaveholding society.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas D. ''The Oglethorpe Plan: Enlightenment Design in Savannah and Beyond''. Charlottesville, Va.: University of Virginia Press, 2012. See Epilogue.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Amos A. ''James Edward Oglethorpe: Imperial Idealist''. Oxford, UK: Clarendon, 1936. Chapter IX.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many others who warrant mention may not acknowledged in Clarkson's list. A section is provided below for the addition of other forerunners. For a more comprehensive list that includes subsequent periods, see [[List of abolitionists]].

Many of the London salons and circles of the 1770s and later took up the cause of antislavery, at least intellectually, thus paving the way for later action. Examples include Johnson's Circle, the Blue Stocking Society, and James Oglethorpe's associates.&lt;ref&gt;Eger, Elizabeth. Bluestockings: Women of Reason from Enlightenment to Romanticism.

Of the 440 million increase, about 340 million was attributable to net migration and urban reclassification. Even if only half of that increase was migration, the volume of rural-urban migration in such a short period is likely the largest in human history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

China's government influences the pattern of urbanization through the [[Hukou system|Hukou]] permanent residence registration system, land-sale policies, infrastructure investment and the incentives offered to local government officials. The other factors influencing migration of people from rural provincial areas to large cities are more employment, education, and business opportunities, and higher standard of living.

==History and origins==

===Qing dynasty===

====Northeast====
In 1668 during the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]], the Qing government decreed a prohibition of non-[[Eight Banners|Eight Banner]] people getting into Northeast China Manchuria of their origin. Han Chinese were banned from settling in this region but the rule was openly violated and Han Chinese became a majority in urban areas by the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Manchu and the Qing Dynasty|url=http://alphahistory.com/chineserevolution/manchu-qing-dynasty/|website=Alpha History|publisher=Alpha History|accessdate=October 25, 2016|date=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However Qing rule saw an massively increasing amount of Han Chinese both illegally and legally streaming into Manchuria and settling down to cultivate land as Manchu landlords desired Han Chinese peasants to rent on their land and grow grain, most Han Chinese migrants were not evicted as they went over the Great Wall and Willow Palisade, during the eighteenth century Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares of privately owned land in Manchuria and 203,583 hectares of lands which were part of coutrier stations, noble estates, and Banner lands, in garrisons and towns in Manchuria Han Chinese made up 80% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HQ5KbXYhEB8C&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=sedentary+farming+manchu&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Ji7L_j2V1&amp;sig=uQGL-sSQn1a2b1y1e5qTYLMMjq8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBmoVChMItoTTucbPxgIVSVseCh3WWgJY#v=onepage&amp;q=sedentary%20farming%20manchu&amp;f=false Richards 2003], p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Han Chinese farmers were resettled from north China by the Qing to the area along the Liao River in order to restore the land to cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3985584?seq=2 Reardon-Anderson 2000], p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt; Wasteland was reclaimed by Han Chinese squatters in addition to other Han who rented land from Manchu landlords.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3985584?seq=3 Reardon-Anderson 2000], p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite officially prohibiting Han Chinese settlement on the Manchu and Mongol lands, by the 18th century the Qing decided to settle Han refugees from northern China who were suffering from famine, floods, and drought into Manchuria and Inner Mongolia so that Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares in Manchuria and tens of thousands of hectares in Inner Mongolia by the 1780s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3985584?seq=4 Reardon-Anderson 2000], p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Qianlong Emperor]] allowed Han Chinese peasants suffering from drought to move into Manchuria despite him issuing edicts in favor of banning them from 1740-1776.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/fileadmin/chinastudien/papers/No_1998-1.pdf Scharping 1998], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese tenant farmers rented or even claimed title to land from the "imperial estates" and Manchu Bannerlands in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3985584?seq=5 Reardon-Anderson 2000], p. 507.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides moving into the Liao area in southern Manchuria, the path linking [[Jinzhou]], [[Shenyang|Fengtian]], [[Tieling]], [[Changchun]], [[Hulunbuir|Hulun]], and [[Ningguta]] was settled by Han Chinese during the Qianlong Emperor's reign, and Han Chinese were the majority in urban areas of Manchuria by 1800.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3985584?seq=6 Reardon-Anderson 2000], p. 508.&lt;/ref&gt; To increase the Imperial Treasury's revenue, the Qing sold formerly Manchu only lands along the Sungari to Han Chinese at the beginning of the [[Daoguang Emperor]]'s reign, and Han Chinese filled up most of Manchuria's towns by the 1840s according to Abbe Huc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3985584?seq=7 Reardon-Anderson 2000], p. 509.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inner Mongolia====
Han Chinese were officially forbidden to settle in Inner and Outer Mongolia. Mongols were forbidden from crossing into the Han Chinese 18 provinces (neidi) without permission and were given punishments if they did. Mongols were forbidden from crossing into another Mongol leagues. Han Chinese settlers violated the rule and crossed into and settled in Inner Mongolia.

Despite officially prohibiting Han Chinese settlement on the Manchu and Mongol lands, by the 18th century the Qing decided to settle Han refugees from northern China who were suffering from famine, floods, and drought into Manchuria and Inner Mongolia so that Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares in Manchuria and tens of thousands of hectares in Inner Mongolia by the 1780s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3985584|title=Land Use and Society in Manchuria and Inner Mongolia during the Qing Dynasty|last=Reardon-Anderson|first=James|date=Oct 2000|volume= 5|pages=503–530|number=No. 4|journal=Environmental History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordinary Mongols were not allowed to travel outside their own leagues. Mongols were forbidden by the Qing from crossing the borders of their banners, even into other Mongol Banners and from crossing into neidi (the Han Chinese 18 provinces) and were given serious punishments if they did in order to keep the Mongols divided against each other to benefit the Qing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fA7ADxUa6vUC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Cross+league+borders+mongols&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yqgfVMatINiiyATElYKAAQ&amp;ved=0CCcQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cross%20league%20borders%20mongols&amp;f=false Bulag 2012], p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the eighteenth century, growing numbers of [[Han Chinese]] settlers had illegally begun to move into the Inner Mongolian steppe. By 1791 there had been so many Han Chinese settlers in the [[Qian Gorlos Mongol Autonomous County|Front Gorlos Banner]] that the jasak had petitioned the Qing government to legalize the status of the peasants who had already settled there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of China |volume=10 |year=1978 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn= |page=356 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Xinjiang====
{{main article|Migration to Xinjiang}}

The Qing implemented two different policies for [[Dzungaria]] (Northern Xinjiang) and the [[Tarim Basin]] ([[Altishahr]], Southern Xinjiang). The Manchus had wiped out the native Buddhist [[Oirats|Oirat]] [[Dzungar people|Dzungars]] in their land of Dzungaria. Then the Qing implemented a large scale settlement in Dzungaria to colonize the newly empty grasslands. Han Chinese were encouraged by the Qing to permanently settle and colonize Dzungaria while permanent Han settlers were banned from the Tarim with only Han merchants allowed. The ban was lifted in the 1820s after the invasion of [[Jahangir Khoja]] and Han Chinese were allowed to permanently settle in the Tarim.

Hans were around one third of Xinjiang's population in 1800, during the time of the [[Qing Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bovingdon|2010|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Chinese and Central Asian History at Georgetown University, James A. Millward wrote that foreigners often mistakenly think that [[Urumqi]] was originally a Uyghur city and that the Chinese destroyed its Uyghur character and culture, however, Ürümqi was founded as a Chinese city by Han and Hui (Tungans), and it is the Uyghurs who are new to the city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MC6sAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 1998], p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MC6sAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 1998], p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; While a few people try to give a misportrayal of the historical Qing situation in light of the contemporary situation in Xinjiang with Han migration, and claim that the Qing settlements and state farms were an anti-Uyghur plot to replace them in their land, Professor James A. Millward pointed out that the Qing agricultural colonies in reality had nothing to do with Uyghur and their land, since the Qing banned settlement of Han in the Uyghur Tarim Basin and in fact directed the Han settlers instead to settle in the non-Uyghur Dzungaria and the new city of Ürümqi, so that the state farms which were settled with 155,000 Han Chinese from 1760-1830 were all in Dzungaria and Ürümqi, where there was only an insignificant amount of Uyghurs, instead of the Tarim Basin oases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 2007], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 19th century, 40 years after the Qing reconquest, there were around 155,000 Han and Hui Chinese in northern Xinjiang and somewhat more than twice that number of Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang.&lt;ref&gt;Millward, James A. (2007). ''Eurasian crossroads: A history of Xinjiang''. {{ISBN|978-0-231-13924-3}}. p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; A census of Xinjiang under Qing rule in the early 19th century tabulated ethnic shares of the population as 30% [[Han Chinese|Han]] and 60% [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], while it dramatically shifted to 6% Han and 75% Uyghur in the 1953 census, however a situation similar to the Qing era-demographics with a large number of Han has been restored as of 2000 with 40.57% Han and 45.21% Uyghur.&lt;ref name="ddx"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/EWCWwp001.pdf |title=Demographics and Development in Xinjiang after 1949 |first=Stanley |last=Toops |date=May 2004 |page=1|issue=1 |periodical=East-West Center Washington Working Papers |publisher=[[East–West Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Stanley W. Toops noted that today's demographic situation is similar to that of the early Qing period in Xinjiang. In northern Xinjiang, the Qing brought in Han, Hui, Uyghur, Xibe, and Kazakh colonists after they [[Zunghar genocide|exterminated the Zunghar Oirat Mongols]] in the region, with one third of Xinjiang's total population consisting of Hui and Han in the northern are, while around two thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GXj4a3gss8wC&amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ed. Starr 2004], p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

The genocide victim Dzungars were the natives of northern Xinjiang. Han, Manchu, and Southern Xinjiang's Turkic Taranchi Muslims were all colonizers in Northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria).

====Tibet====
The Qing stationed both Manchu Bannermen and Han Chinese Green Standard Army soldiers in Tibet. A community descended from Han Chinese soldiers and officials grew in Lhasa.

At multiple places such as Lhasa, Batang, Dartsendo, Lhari, Chamdo, and Litang, Green Standard troops were garrisoned throughout the Dzungar war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K5pBedqHEtcC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=green+standard+army+lhasa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vL4HVafZCcaggwSfxIKwBw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=green%20standard%20army%20lhasa&amp;f=false Wang 2011], p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Green Standard Army]] troops and Manchu Bannermen were both part of the Qing force who fought in Tibet in the war against the Dzungars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DYHfVVAAf_kC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=green+standard+army+lhasa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vL4HVafZCcaggwSfxIKwBw&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=green%20standard%20army%20lhasa&amp;f=false Dai 2009], p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; It was said that the Sichuan commander Yue Zhongqi entered Lhasa first when the 2,000 Green Standard soldiers and 1,000 Manchu soldiers of the "Sichuan route" seized Lhasa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DYHfVVAAf_kC&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Dai 2009], pp. 81-2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mark C. Elliott, after 1728 the Qing used [[Green Standard Army]] troops to man the garrison in Lhasa rather than [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&amp;pg=PA412&amp;dq=green+standard+army+lhasa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vL4HVafZCcaggwSfxIKwBw&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=green%20standard%20army%20lhasa&amp;f=false Elliott 2001], p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Evelyn S. Rawski both Green Standard Army and Bannermen made up the Qing garrison in Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5iN5J9G76h0C&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=green+standard+army+lhasa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vL4HVafZCcaggwSfxIKwBw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=green%20standard%20army%20lhasa&amp;f=false Rawski 1998], p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sabine Dabringhaus, Green Standard Chinese soldiers numbering more than 1,300 were stationed by the Qing in Tibet to support the 3,000 strong Tibetan army.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PIeOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=green+standard+army+lhasa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KsMHVdmoBYiYgwSy0oKoDA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=green%20standard%20army%20lhasa&amp;f=false Dabringhaus 2014], p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 19th century, arriving with an Amban, a community of Chinese troops from Sichuan who married Tibetan women settled down in the Lubu neighborhood of Lhasa, where their descendants established a community and assimilated into Tibetan culture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-d6PAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Yeh 2009], p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Hebalin was the location of where Chinese Muslim troops and their offspring lived, while Lubu was the place where Han Chinese troops and their offspring lived.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BdKRAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=lubu+chinese+lhasa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4sQHVYuCOMulNr2Jg6gC&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=lubu%20chinese%20lhasa&amp;f=false Yeh 2013], p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Republic of China===
The unique [[hukou system]] of China distinguishes Chinese internal migration from migration in other developing countries.&lt;ref name=paper5&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Zhong|title=Rural-Urban Migration in China – What Do We Know and What Do We Need to Know?|journal=China Center for Economic Research Peking University|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, China established the universal hukou system that restricted the mobility of the population.&lt;ref name=zhao2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Yaohui|title=Rural-to-Urban Labor Migration in China: The Past and the Present|journal=Rural Labor Flows in China|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aimed to tie farmers to land, secure agricultural supply as well as to support industrial sector in cities after the [[Great Leap Forward]] and [[Great Chinese Famine]] which caused at least 30 millions deaths.&lt;ref name=paper5 /&gt; The government allocated housing, jobs, food and other necessities based on the hukou system, which made it almost impossible for people without local hukou status to live in urban areas.&lt;ref name=Cai2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cai|first=Fang|title=Institutional Barriers in Two Processes of Rural Labor Migration in China, Working Paper Series No. 9|journal=Institute of Population Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Hukou system, the [[people's commune]] system was another tool to control labor mobility. Under the people's commune system, the earnings of farmers were closely related to their daily participation in the [[collective farming]]. In 1978, during [[Chinese economic reform]], this system was replaced by the [[household-responsibility system]], which loosened the restriction of people's mobility.&lt;ref name=ZHU&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Nong|title=The Impacts of Income Gaps on Migration Decisions in China|journal=China Economic Review|year=2002|volume=13|issue=2–3|pages=213–230|doi=10.1016/s1043-951x(02)00074-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Huang and Pieke divide the migration policy evolution after [[Chinese economic reform]] into four periods. The first period is from 1979 to 1983, during which the government still prohibited migration. The second period is from 1984 to 1988 when farmers were allowed to enter urban areas on the condition that they provided their own food. The third period is from 1989 to 1991 when migration became much more popular and had attracted much attention from the government. The fourth period is from 1992 to 2000, during which the government in some degree encouraged migration, while urban local governments controlled migration more strictly because of high unemployment rates in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=Ping|author2=Frank N. Pieke|title=China Migration Country Study|journal=Conference on Migration, Development and Pro-Poor Policy Choices in Asia, Dhaka, June 22–24, 2003|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1949 to 1985, the [[net migration rate]] for China was 0.24, compared with world average of 1.84 from 1950 to 1990.&lt;ref name=zhao2000 /&gt; Since the mid-1980s, rural to urban migration became a constant social phenomenon. Zhao and Sicular report that the number of rural-urban migration doubled between the late 1980s and the mid 1990s. In 1989, there were 8.9 million migrants and in 1994 the number increased to 23.0 millions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sicular|first=Terry|author2=Yaohui Zhao|title=Employment and Earnings in Rural China|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 it was estimated that China was experiencing a –0.39 per 1,000 population net migration rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to National Bureau of Statistics, there were 252.78 million migrant workers in China in 2011.&lt;ref name=statistics /&gt;

== Occupational profile==
Rural-urban migrant workers have a significant presence in China's labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fang|first=Cai|title=The Trend of Change of the Labour Market and the Urgency of Training Rural Migrant Workers|journal=China Association for Employment Promotion/Microsoft Seminar on Occupational Training for Migrant Workers Held in Beijing, China|year=2005|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9781138909977/|title=NGO Governance and Management in China|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781317437147|editor-last=Hasmath|editor-first=Reza|location=|pages=13|language=en|quote=|editor-last2=Hsu|editor-first2=Jennifer Y. J.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006, migrant workers comprised 40% of the total urban labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Decent Work, Employment and Poverty Reduction in Urban China|journal=Institute of International Labour Studies, MoLSS and the International Labour Organization|date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to data from National Bureau of Statistics, in 2009 nearly 39.1% of them worked in [[manufacturing]], about 17.3% in [[construction]] and more than 7.8% in wholesale and retail. In addition, the number of the migrants who were employed in the [[tertiary sector of the economy]] was increasing, which indicated a new trend of employment choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mengxia|first=Zhan|title=Employment Conditions of Chinese Migrant labors|url=http://www.china.com.cn/guoqing/2012-12/24/content_27499882.htm|publisher=Chinese National Condition|accessdate=16 April}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report from [[International Labour Organization]] in 2006 states that there were also 80 million workers working in the [[informal sector]] and it was estimated that between two-thirds and three-quarters of all new employment is in the informal economy.&lt;ref name=paper7&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tuñón|first=Max|title=Internal Labour Migration in China: Features and Responses|journal=ILO Office, Beijing|date=April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the informal economy, many rural migrants are engaged in low-paying and temporary jobs such as sanitation workers and porters. Zhu addresses that they are not "employed" in the informal sector, but they "have access only" to the informal sector.&lt;ref name=ZHU /&gt; 
 
Scholars agree that there is a sharp [[occupational segregation]] between migrants and the local population.&lt;ref name=paper7 /&gt; A study that compared employment situations of urban residents and migrant labors in 2005 reports that around 52% of migrants were self-employed, while 12% of the local residents were self-employed; 12% of migrant workers were employed in the [[public sector]], compared with 68% of the local workforce.&lt;ref name=Meiyan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Meiyan|author2=Fang Cai|title=Local vs. Migrant Workers: Employment Opportunities and Wage Differentials in Urban China|journal=CESifo Economic Studies Conference on Understanding the Chinese Economy|date=June 2005|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of segregation varies from province to province. A series of field studies by China Center for Economic Research demonstrate that the labor market in [[Sichuan]] province is relatively integrated, while in [[Guangdong]] province and [[Shanghai]] the labor market is quite segregated with "rural migratory-worker urban-resident-worker dualism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=CCER, 1998a|title=The Segregation and Integration of Urban Workers and Rural Migrants - The Case of Shanghai|journal=Reform|year=1998|issue=4|pages=99–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=CCER, 1998b|title=An Analysis for the Migratory Labor Supply Shortage – The Case of Zhongshan at Guangdong Province|journal=Reform|year=1998|issue=5|pages=64–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=CCER, 1998c|title=A Integrated Rural-Urban Labor Market – The Case of Mianyang at Sichuan Province|journal=Reform|year=1998|issue=5|pages=74–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In addition to inadequate social protection, the primary reason of the occupational segregation is the migrant workers’ lack of skills and education, which keeps them in [[manual labor]].&lt;ref name=paper7 /&gt; Migrant workers have less [[human capital]] since they have less schooling, shorter job tenure and less training compared with the local residents.&lt;ref name=Meiyan /&gt; Moreover, because of the high rate of job mobility among rural migrant workers, employers have little incentive to train them and thereby prevent them from increasing their social capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knight|first=J.|author2=L. Yueh|title=Job Mobility of Residents and Migrants in Urban China|journal=Journal of Comparative Economics|year=2004|volume=32|issue=4|page=641|doi=10.1016/j.jce.2004.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
The causes of migration can originate from various factors within Chinese societies. Migration in some contexts can refer to the search for self-identity and self-transformation which pushed many young workers to migrate to more urbanized areas of China. This search for self-identity and self transformation was consequence of recent [[globalization]]. "Mobility and modernity have become inextricably linked in the contemporary era of globalization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaetano|first1=Arianna|title=Out to work: Migration, Gender, and the Changing Lives of Rural women in Contemporary China|date=2015|publisher=Univ of Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-4098-3|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, migration to distant cities for work was not an option for most rural workers of previous generations. Migration created many opportunities for both women and men to extricate themselves from their current rural status and create a new name for themselves and their family. Thirdly, migration enabled the rural youth to become wage earners, consumers and city-dwellers which allowed them to become more globalized and mobile than they would have within their own respective villages. While the urbanization of Chinese workers provides them with more opportunity, it also can constrain them, as migrant workers, specifically females, typically make lower wages and are viewed as replaceable labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaetano|first1=Arianne|title=Out to Work|date=2015|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Population_density_in_Eastern_Provinces.png|thumb|right|A population density map. The eastern, coastal provinces are much more densely populated than the western interior because of the opportunities available to migrants.]]

===Surplus labor===
Labor surplus in rural areas is often regarded as one of the factors of internal migration in China. Central to this theory is that surplus rural labor provides a needed work force for industrial growth in urban areas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Kevin Honglin|author2=Shunfeng Song|title=Rural–urban Migration and Urbanization in China: Evidence from Time-series and Cross-section Analyses|journal=China Economic Review|date=Sep 2003|volume=14|issue=4|pages=386–400|doi=10.1016/j.chieco.2003.09.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, the [[Household-responsibility system]] (HRS) established during [[Chinese economic reform]] was productive and generated [[surplus labor]] in rural areas.&lt;ref name=Zhao1&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in urban areas the development of the special economic zones and industries created demand for labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|author2=Junsen Zhang|title=The Two-Tier Labor Market in Urban China|journal=Journal of Comparative Economics|year=2001|volume=29|issue=3|pages=485–504|doi=10.1006/jcec.2001.1730}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Jeffrey G.|title=Migration and Urbanization|journal=Handbook of Development Economics|year=1988|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that, while the surplus rural labor is viewed as the main "push factor", demand for labor can be regarded as the main "pull factor". Others&lt;ref name=paper5 /&gt;  contend that high [[unemployment]] rates in urban areas rejected this paradigm.

===Income gap===
Early in 1970, the [[Harris-Todaro model]] recognized that the persistent wage differential between urban and rural sectors is a main "pull" factor of migration in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=John R.|author2=Michael P. Todaro|title=Migration, Unemployment and Development: A Two-Sector Analysis|journal=American Economic Review|year=1970|volume=60|issue=1|pages=126–142|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/36707745.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Zhu's study conducted in 2002, he presents a model of migration in his study and confirms the significance of the urban-rural income gap for migration decisions.&lt;ref name=ZHU /&gt; Studies of Dr. Cai, Director of Institute of Population and Labor Economics, demonstrate that an increase of the ratio of local rural income to the average national rural income will reduce migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cai|first=Fang|title=An Economic Analysis for Labor Migration and Mobility|journal=China Social Sciences Quarterly|year=1996|volume=Spring|pages=120–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the huge rural-urban income gap, the regional income gap also drives internal migration in China. As noted by Zhao whose research interest mainly lies in labor economics, many migrants flow from the western region with low incomes to the eastern region with higher incomes.&lt;ref name=paper5 /&gt;

===Migrant networks===
Migrant networks have a significant role in labor migration. Migrant networks are "sets of interpersonal ties that connect migrants, former migrants, and non-immigrants" &lt;ref name="Zhao 2003 500–511"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Yaohui|title=The Role of Migrant Networks in Labor Migration: The Case of China|journal=Contemporary Economic Policy|year=2003|volume=21|issue=4|pages=500–511|doi=10.1093/cep/byg028}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the ties of family members, friendships, and the overall community. The role is "particularly prominent in situations in which migration involves large informational or psychic costs, such as when moving to a completely different culture or environment or if the destination labor market is hostile to immigrants".&lt;ref name="Zhao 2003 500–511"/&gt; China's migrants are heavily dependent on their migrant networks to assist them in finding jobs and houses, while also making sure they are financially stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xu|first1=Qingwen|title=Migrant Workers' Community in China: Relationships among Social Networks, Life Satisfaction and Political Participation|journal=Psychosocial Intervention|date=November 3, 2011|volume=20|issue=3|pages=281–294|doi=10.5093/in2011v20n3a5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migrant networks can reduce the cost of labor migration by providing job information and supportive relationships to the immigrants, as well as job search assistance. These networks can be described by the Chinese term [[Guanxi]] which "describes the basic dynamic in personalized networks of influence." Migrant workers can potentially find jobs at a restaurant or within the garment industry run by migrants from the same origins. In a study conducted by Liang and Morroka, whose research focuses on migration in China, they reported that female migrants are more likely to rely on the developed migration networks, while younger migrants and those with higher level of education are less likely to depend on the networks.

== Benefits and costs ==

===Benefits===
How do transient individuals experience migration in China, and what are the cultural, social, and even political ramifications of their migration experience? Through these experiences, many migrants come to expect certain benefits. Gaetano explains that China “understands that a woman should have a life outside of the fields and the kitchen. This awareness will surely help improve the quality of life for women in the rural areas.”&lt;ref name="Univ. of Hawaii"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaetano|first1=Arianna|title=Out to work: Migration, Gender, and the Changing Lives of Rural women in Contemporary China|date=2015|publisher=Univ. of Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-4098-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quote suggests that rural women in particular who were exposed to modern globalization of gender and cultural roles lived improved lives.
Labor in China was greatly [[sex segregation|segregated]] by gender.&lt;ref name="Univ. of Hawaii"/&gt; Where typically young, beautiful women found jobs in the beauty industry and often found better wages and living quarters. Gaetano further explains that “women have had a virtual monopoly in urban domestic service and hotel and restaurant hospitality”.&lt;ref name="Univ. of Hawaii"/&gt; While females took the hospitality industry, males found themselves in the low-skill, low-wage industrial jobs which includes construction-like jobs. Though the jobs held grueling hours, being paid and establishing an identity separate from their household was a huge benefit for many transient workers.&lt;ref name="Univ. of Hawaii"/&gt;
Generally speaking, the difference in living standards between rural and urban workers was apparent where urban workers tended to live a more lavish lifestyle. This lavish lifestyle included better living quarters, nutrition, guanxi (social connections), and access to education. Education especially was a huge factor for the migration of families. Rural women were seeking to better educate their offspring in the hopes of better economic success for their children.&lt;ref name="Univ. of Hawaii"/&gt;

===Costs===
With the benefits of migration comes the cost of migration for many transient workers.&lt;ref name="Life in a Mobile Nation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yu|first1=Gau|title=Life in a Mobile Nation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/12/03/life-in-a-mobile-nation/the-high-cost-of-migration-in-china|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though traveling to a larger city with more opportunities  appeared beneficial, in many instances migrants were treated harshly and viewed as second class citizens. Gao Yu, the China country director for the Landesa Rural Development Institute in Seattle stated that “Migrants who move with their children face a host of other challenges, including enrolling their children in school. Many schools regard prior education background as an important criterion and will not admit children educated in rural schools – often considered inferior.”&lt;ref name="Life in a Mobile Nation"/&gt; This quote suggests that many migrants and their children were seen as inferior in schools, as well as in many other public areas in China. Because  many rural Chinese workers were making about $2 a day, they were forced to move to the city, causing an influx of migrant workers who were seeking better opportunities. In response, In the mid 1980s in China, in order to control migration rates, transient workers were required to carry personal identity cards, employment registration card, and a certificate of good health which often had high fees due to corruption and were many times denied by the [[Hukou system]][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcICGjnNRRg]&lt;ref name="Univ. of Hawaii"/&gt; At the time, migrants were seen as a nuisance to society and needed to be kept in check. However, in the mid-2000s attitudes towards migration drastically changed. In the novel Out to work, Migration, Gender, and the Changing Lives of Rural Women in Contemporary China, Gaetano explained how “Migrants were finally recognized to be critical in narrowing the rural-urban income gap, as they redistribute wealth through remittances and apply new knowledge and skills to develop rural areas”.&lt;ref name="Univ. of Hawaii"/&gt; Even though China recognized the importance of [[migrant workers]], their “low levels of education, skills, and work experience, and their dearth of urban social connections, combined with the hukou-based job distribution” still created many disadvantages for rural migrants.&lt;ref name="Univ. of Hawaii"/&gt;

== Social impacts ==

=== Labor supply ===
In general, the current system of [[circular migration]] of floating populations in China offers greater labor resources to coastal areas of high economic activity, but "although labor productivity in migrant activities is higher than it is in local nonfarm sectors, the current economic cost of migration in China is so high as to significantly limit such reallocation. The current system therefore works to reduce the overall productivity of labor and causes a tremendous loss of social resources."&lt;ref name=Zhao1 /&gt; In other words, research done by Yaohui Zhao at Beijing University indicates that while economic theory demonstrates labor migration to increase efficiency due to the reallocation of labor, the economic cost of migration actually mitigates gains in efficiency enough that internal migration under the Hukou system results in financial and social losses instead of gains.

=== Violations of labor standards ===
Violations of [[labor standards]] involve labor contracts, [[working conditions]], [[wage]] payments and [[social insurance]].&lt;ref name=paper1 /&gt; The problems in terms of labor standards violations are rooted in institutional discrimination against migrant workers as well as inadequate law enforcement.&lt;ref name=paper7 /&gt;

Low incidents of labor contracts are a main form of labor standards violations, which allows employers to further violate [[labor rights]] in many other aspects. According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Urban and Rural Development, Ministry of Labor and Social Security and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in 2004, only between 10% and 37.5% of the migrants working in the construction industry signed labor contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Weile nongmin’gong de hefa quanyi (For the sake of migrant workers’ legal rights|newspaper=Zhongguo Jianshe Bao (Chinese Construction News)|date=7 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent research by the Jinan Daily demonstrates that eight out of ten migrant workers did not know what the labor contract was. Many employers thus take advantage of migrant workers’ unawareness and do not fulfill their obligations to sign labor contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frost|first=S.|title=China View|url=http://www.csr-asia.com/index.php?p=2873|publisher=CSR Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The working condition is one manifest aspect of labor standards violations.The majority of migrants work more hours per day and more days per week than what is limited by labor law. The Chinese Household Income Project Survey of 2002 show that over 80% of migrants worked seven days per week, and only 7% workers’ working time was in accordance with what law regulated. It also showed that around 33.3% of migrant workers worked 9 to 10 hours per day, about 25% 11 to 12 hours and 12% 13 or more hours per day.&lt;ref name="working condition"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shi|first=Li|title=Rural migrant workers in China: Scenario, challenges and public policy|year=2008|publisher=ILO}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Safety]] is another concern regarding the working condition. The prevalence of migrant workers in dangerous jobs results in a high number of work-related illnesses, injuries and deaths.&lt;ref name=paper7/&gt;  Migrant workers make up 80% of the deaths in mining, construction, and chemical factories. And about 90% of those suffering from work-related [[diseases]] are migrant workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Zhenzhen|author2=Lian Pengling|title=Health Vulnerability among Temporary Migrants in Urban China|journal=International Population Conference Held in Tours, France|year=2005|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of wage payment, although labor law regulates a [[minimum wage]], many employers either ignore the regulation or consider it to be the maximum wage.&lt;ref name=paper7 /&gt; According to an article in China Daily in 2006, nearly 30% of migrant workers earned RMB 300 and 500 on average per month, nearly 40% between RMB 500 and 800 and about 28% more than RMB 800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rural-urban Income Gap Continues to Widen|newspaper=China Daily|date=April 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is common for migrant workers not to receive their wage on time, due to the lack of protection of labor rights.&lt;ref name="working condition" /&gt; The government has realized the seriousness of wage arrears and taken many measures to deal with this issue. The situation has been improved a lot, but overall the problem of wage arrears still exists. In 2006, around 10% of rural-urban migrant workers received their wages on average seven months late.&lt;ref name=RO&gt;{{cite journal|last=Research Office Project Team, State Council|title=Research Report on Rural Migrant Workers in China|journal=China Yanshi Press|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limited access of migrant workers to social insurance highlights their vulnerability.&lt;ref name="working condition" /&gt; A survey conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture in 2005 reports that only 13% of rural-urban migrant workers had insurance coverage for occupational injuries and diseases, only 10% for [[medical insurance]] and 15% for [[pension scheme]].&lt;ref name=RO /&gt; Another survey reports that migrant workers’ participation in pension schemes was as high as 33.7%; medical care, 21.6%; unemployment insurance, 10.3%; employment injury insurance, 31.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Junfeng|author2=Moazam Mahmood|title=Employment, Decent Work and  Poverty Reduction in Urban China|journal=Regional and Country Policy Coherence Report No. 4|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences estimates that less than 5% got pension insurance and less than 3% of rural migrant laborers enjoyed [[unemployment insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=China Human Development Report 2005|journal=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Class and inequality ===
At a group expert meeting of the United Nations in January 2008, a number of class-based implications of Chinese urban growth due to migration were identified, including "wage arrears, unfair compensation for land expropriated, urban poverty," issues of "public safety and social stability," and the potential creation of a "permanent urban underclass" of 200 million or more workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chan|first=Kam Wing|title=Internal Labor Migration in China: Trends, Geographical Distribution and Policies|journal=United Nations|date=January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Class inequality is commonly reflected in income differentials; "in urban China, urban resident annual earnings are 1.3 times larger than long-term rural migrant earnings as observed in a nationally represented sample in 2002."&lt;ref name="Démurger 610–628"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Health ===
The floating population of Chinese migrant workers "presents major public health challenges, especially in the provision of reproductive health care for migrant women and the need to address the increased risk to both sexes of infection with sexually transmitted diseases and HIV."&lt;ref name="Liang 2004 467–488"/&gt; A survey of migrant workers published in the journal "Public Health Reports" indicated that "forty-seven percent of the migrants were unwilling to make contributions to health insurance," and "poor living conditions and inattention to health may make migrants vulnerable to poor long-term health."&lt;ref name="Hesketh"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these health issues presented by the floating population, certain factors mitigate the health impact of internal migration in China. In a questionnaire administered to a variety of rural, urban, and migrant workers in Zhejing Province, Eastern China, 2004, indicated that "Migrants had the best self-rated health and reported the least acute illness, chronic disease, and disability, after controlling for age and education."&lt;ref name="Hesketh" /&gt; In light of this data, the researchers concluded that the migrants had zero HIV infections, and the migrant workers examined demonstrated the "healthy migrant effect." Despite this, migration still creates a negative effect on public health due to the lack of affordable health care.&lt;ref name="Hesketh" /&gt;

==== Mental health ====
Historically, "migration has been associated with increased vulnerability to mental health problems," and this has prompted some research into the mental health status of China's hundreds of millions of rural-urban migrants. Research by scholars from Zhejiang University and the UCL Centre for International Health and Development has however revealed that "rural-urban migrant workers in this part of China are not especially vulnerable to poor mental health."&lt;ref name="Li Mental"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that this "may result from a sense of well being associated with upward economic mobility and improved opportunities, and the relatively high social capital in migrant communities."&lt;ref name="Li Mental" /&gt; Thus, the "healthy migrant effect" also exhibits itself in the mental health of rural-urban migrants in China.

=== Gender ===
Migration in China has produced a number of important impacts with regard to gender and gender equality in modern China. This process, usually known as a 'transition', "has gendered consequences and differential implications for men and women."&lt;ref name="Fan Genderv27"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Education ===

[[File:Beijing school classroom.jpg|thumb|left|Classroom in a [[Migrant School|school for migrant]] students in [[Beijing]] (Dongba district).]]
According to a research conducted by Zai Liang and Yiu Por Chen and published in the journal "Social Science Research", "migration usually has negative consequences for children's schooling because of the loss of social capital in schools, neighborhood, and community of origin."&lt;ref name="Liang 28–47"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, migrant children can study in urban public schools, but access is usually limited. The main reason is that the education budget for compulsory education is allocated through local governments and strictly based on local hukou population. Many of the urban public schools with a limited education budget are consequently reluctant to accept migrant children.&lt;ref name=paper2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Démurger|first=Sylvie|author2=Hui Xu|title=Left-behind children and return decisions of rural migrants in China|journal=IZA Discussion Paper|year=2013|volume=7727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One usual way for migrant children to study in urban [[Education in China|public schools]], which is distinct from usual admission procedure, is to pay "sponsorship" fees (zanzhu fei).&lt;ref name=paper1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biao|first=Xiang|title=How far are the left‐behind left behind? A preliminary study in rural China|journal=Population, Space and Place|year=2007|volume=13|issue=3|pages=179–191|doi=10.1002/psp.437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of such fees can be prohibitive for poor migrant parents, which impedes many migrant children to get enrolled in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lai|first=Z.|author2=Y. P. Chen|title=The educational consequences of migration for children in China|journal=Investing in Human Capital for Economic Development in Halshs|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to now, there are some improvements in terms of access to urban public schools and some cities have banned "sponsorship" fees, but specific policy varies from city to city. A large portion of migrant children are still excluded from the urban public education system.&lt;ref name=Hu /&gt;

In response to the lack of access to public educational resources, migrants in some big cities began to set their own schools since the 1990s. These schools are known as migrant-sponsored schools (nongmingong zidi xuexiao). At the beginning, urban authorities refused to grant licenses and even closed down the schools. Although local governments didn’t need to be responsible for migrants’ welfare,
they should still be responsible for any accident such as the collapse of buildings or food poisoning that happened in the
schools.&lt;ref name=paper1 /&gt; These schools are usually less expensive with average tuition fees around 300 RMB per semester.&lt;ref name=Hu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hu|first=Bo|title=Education for migrant children: policy implementation in the changing urban education system in China|journal=PhD Diss., London School of Economics|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lu and Zhang's research conducted in Beijing in 2001, migrant-sponsored schools usually did not have licenses, high education quality, and adequate facilities. They, however, conclude that despite such disadvantages, these schools at least provided migrant children with basic education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lu|first=S.|author2=S. Zhang|title=Education of Migrant Children: Report from Survey of Migrant Schools in Beijing|journal=Strategy and Management|year=2001|volume=4|pages=95–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the issue of access to education, migrant children have to return to their places of their hukou origin to pass the examination for entry to a higher level of education. The entire school enrollment system in China is place-based and they can only pass certain examinations  in their places of hukou origin.&lt;ref name=paper2 /&gt; This leads to discrepancies between what migrant students have studied in urban areas and what they will be examined as textbooks in different cities and provinces can be quite different.&lt;ref name=paper1 /&gt;

===Left-behind children===
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Left-behind child with his grandfather.jpg|thumb|left|A small left-behind child is living with his grandfather.]] --&gt;
[[Left-behind children in China]] refer to the children who live with one parent (usually mother) or extended family (usually grandparents) when their parent(s) is (are) absent from home as migrant workers in urban areas. They are left behind partly because of little access to basic welfare in cities without local hukou status and partly because of high living expenses in cities.&lt;ref name=paper10&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luo, Jiayou|title=The Status of Care and Nutrition of 774 Left-Behind Children in Rural Areas in China|journal=Public Health Reports|year=2008|volume=123|issue=3|page=382|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ministry of Education, in 2012 there were more than 12.6 million migrant children and 58 million left-behind children from 7 years old to 16 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ma|first=Lijuan|title=How Many Left-behind Children are there|url=http://news.k618.cn/xda/201303/t20130324_3016624.html|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left-behind children will have more health, emotional and behavior issues than those who grow up with their parents.&lt;ref name=paper1 /&gt;

Left-behind children are generally less healthy, but the difference is very marginal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=A.|title=Liushouhai' xinli jiankang shuiping fenxi (An analysis of the health level of the psychological status of 'left-behind kids')|journal=Zhongguo Xinli Weisheng Zazhi (Chinese Journal of Psychological Health)|year=2004|volume=18|pages=351–353}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by several professors from [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] reports that left-behind children are more likely to have a less healthy diet and lower rates of physical activity.&lt;ref name=paper9&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gao|first=Yang|title=The Impact of Parental Migration on Health Status and Health Behaviours among Left-behind Adolescent School Children in China|journal=BMC Public Health|year=2010|volume=10|issue=1|page=56|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-10-56|display-authors=etal|pmid=20128901|pmc=2829003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[nutrition]], left-behind children face more nutrition problems such as low intake of some nutrients and poor physical development related to nutrition.&lt;ref name=paper10 /&gt; Further, many studies&lt;ref name=paper9 /&gt;&lt;ref name=paper9 /&gt;&lt;ref name=paper3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Ming-Hsuan|title=Migration and Children's Welfare in China: The Schooling and Health of Children Left-behind|journal=The Journal of Developing Areas|year=2011|volume=44|issue=2|pages=165–182|doi=10.1353/jda.0.0104}}&lt;/ref&gt; find that left-behind children are more likely to have a [[smoking]] habit, compared to children with no migrant parents. Primary causes include insufficient public awareness and lack of health education programs. Weak implementation of related regulations in rural areas such as prohibition to sell cigarettes to children under 18 may also contribute to this unsatisfying situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mao|first=Z.|author2=B. Wu|title=Urban-rural, age and gender differences in health behaviours in the Chinese population: findings from a survey in Hubei, China|journal=Public Health|year=2007|volume=121|issue=10|pages=761–4|doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2007.02.015|pmid=17573082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Left-behind children are also prone to undergo emotional and psychological problems.&lt;ref name=paper9 /&gt; Liang's study of 250 left-behind junior high school students suggests that 16.6% of them felt abandoned, 12.3% had problems expressing difficulties, and 6.5% felt "anguished" when being left behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liang|first=S.|title=Guanzhu nongcun 'liushou zonghe zheng' (Pay attention to the 'left-behind symptoms')|journal=Nongcun Shidian (Rural Perspective)|year=2004|volume=8|issue=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the earlier those children are separated from parents, more symptoms of [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]] will be reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Zhengkui|title=Left too early: the effects of age at separation from parents on Chinese rural children's symptoms of anxiety and depression|journal=American Journal of Public Health|year=2009|volume=99|issue=11|pages=2049–2054|doi=10.2105/ajph.2008.150474|display-authors=etal|pmid=19762669|pmc=2759782}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Moreover, various studies&lt;ref name=paper1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=paper10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=paper3 /&gt; indicate that left-behind children are more likely to have behavioral problems. Qualitative observations indicate that left-behind children often behavior extremely, either withdrawn or excessively aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=L.|title=San nvtong chzou yinfa de shehui youlv (Social concerns raised the accident of three young girls' abandoning home|journal=Zhongguo Minzu Jiaoyu (Education for Ethnic Minorities in China|year=2004|volume=5|pages=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=qian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Qian|first=M.|title=Nongcun liushou haizi de jiaoyu wenti buku hushi (Education of left-behind children not allowed to be neglected|journal=Renmin Zhengxie Bao (People's Political Consultation News)|date=1 Dec 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been reported that left-behind children tend to be "indifferent, introverted, inferior"  &lt;ref name=paper10 /&gt; and "selfish".&lt;ref name=paper3 /&gt; 
 
The problems noted above are mainly due to the fact that the grandparents either spoil the children or fail to give them enough emotional support.&lt;ref name=qian /&gt; Physical weakness and low [[education]] levels of grandparents who take care of left-behind children also contribute to the problems.&lt;ref name=paper9 /&gt;

Comparative studies show that left-behind children's situation is not much worse than that of those living with parents in the same area. On the one hand, the institutions (e.g. the hukou system) that maintain the urban-rural inequality should be modified so that more migrants can settle down in cities with families. On the other hand, [[public resources]] in rural communities should be improved and regional inequality should be further reduced.&lt;ref name=paper1 /&gt;

==Policy theories==
Scholars from a wide variety of fields have recommended policy changes in order to deal with the social issues created by floating populations of migrant workers in China. Some scholars believe that "public policies reducing the cost (including the opportunity cost) of education for rural people could help filling the endowment gap between rural migrants and urban residents in the labor market."&lt;ref name="Démurger 610–628"/&gt; Additionally, scholars have recommended that "new policy initiatives concerning the issue of education and migrant children are sorely needed."&lt;ref name="Liang 28–47"/&gt; Public health scholars recommend that "because health insurance schemes will remain limited for the foreseeable future, attention should focus on providing affordable health care to both uninsured migrants and the urban poor."&lt;ref name="Hesketh"/&gt; In light of the migrant worker [[Foxconn suicides]], labor scholars have recommended that "the government should redistribute income and guarantee benefits to rural residents and migrant workers to improve living standards."&lt;ref name="Chan 2010 2–10"/&gt; Those studying labor mobility believe that "the artificial restrictions under which rural-urban migrants work in the cities, i.e. the prohibition on or impediments to urban settlement, restricted access to skilled jobs, and the system of short-term contracts, may have generated an excessively high migrant mobility rate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

January 2011.]] The issue of internal migration and health in China is intricately linked with the health policies national and local level governments enforce. "Policy toward rural-urban migration in China has undergone a significant shift in the last decade, and improving the working and living conditions and access to health care of migrant workers in cities is now clearly on the agenda of national and local governments. Nonetheless, migrants’ mobility and their concentration in hazardous industries continue to make it difficult to reduce their exposure to environmental and occupational health risks and to ensure their access to affordable care."&lt;ref name="Holdaway" &gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to further improve the "living conditions and acces to health care of migrant workers in cities," a number of scholars have recently provided policy recommendations.&lt;ref name="Holdaway" /&gt;

In general, public health scholars recommend that "because health insurance schemes will remain limited for the foreseeable future, attention should focus on providing affordable health care to both uninsured migrants and the urban poor."&lt;ref name="Hesketh" /&gt; In light of this recommendation, further research has been conducted in order to assess the status of internal migration and health in China, as well as to provide more specific policy recommendations in order to address any issues. Research conducted by a team from Beijing Normal University and the Institute of Development Studies has provided a number of specific recommendations for policy makers. In a journal article published in [[The Lancet]], this team voiced three primary concerns regarding the health of migrants in China. These concerns consisted of the spread of communicable and infectious disease, migrant maternal health, and occupational disease and injuries such as silicosis, chemical poisoning, and industrial machinery accidents.&lt;ref name="Hu Health"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond these three primary concerns, the researchers advise policy makers and public health officials to pay more attention to two additional issues. The first of these is mental and behavioural health, which is a "domain that is understudied in China."&lt;ref name="Hu Health" /&gt; The second issue they discuss is that of risk perception. Little is known about how migrants perceive the "various possibilities for health care: self-medication, informal healers, traditional medicine, private clinics with varied levels of care, and more formal hospital treatment."&lt;ref name="Hu Health" /&gt; Research into risk perception will "be crucial to prevention, intervention, and other health-related measures for the migrant population in China.&lt;ref name="Hu Health" /&gt;

Two landmark policy documents regarding [[migrant workers]] were issued in 2002 and 2003, named Document Number 2 of 2002 and Document Number 1 of 2003.These two documents initialized the process of elimination of [[labor market]] [[discrimination]] against migrant workers and legitimization of them. In addition, the 2002 Work Safety Law and the Law on the Prevention and Cure of Occupational Diseases demanded that all employers must guarantee a safe working environment for all employees. In 2004, employers in high-risk industries such as mining and construction were required to cover injury [[insurance]] for migrant workers. In the 2005 Government Work Report, Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] noted that the payment of migrant workers should not be delayed. In March 2006, the State Council called for the establishment of a system that monitored wage delivery to migrant workers. In June 2006, the State Council passed a series of measures to protect migrant workers’ labor rights, following up Circular No. 36. The measures include the restriction of minimum wages, solutions to wage defaults, enforcement of labor contacts and enlargement of migrant workers’ [[social security]] coverage. With the government's continuous efforts, the situation of migrant workers have been improved, though still varying from province to province.&lt;ref name=paper7 /&gt; In 2005, 80% of migrant workers had been fully paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Migrant workers see higher wages|url=http://english.gov.cn/2006- 02/14/content_188183.htm|work=China Daily|date=February 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shanghai]], more than two million migrant workers are in a special social security program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Children of migrants to have same inoculation as urban peers|url=http://english.gov.cn/2006-04/11/content_250645.htm|newspaper=Xinhua|date=April 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education policy===
Early in 2003, China has issued an announcement on migration management and pays much attention on migrant children's education. The government mainly focused on possible financial reform, encouraged [[Education in China|public schools]] to admit more migrant children, forbade extra fees and sponsored migrant-sponsored schools. The announcement noted equal access to education, elimination of sponsorship fees and the government funding for migrant-sponsored schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Li|first=Jing|title=Policy and Reality of Migrant Children's Education|url=http://www.sdny.gov.cn/art/2003/2/21/art_11_7825.html|publisher=Shandong Nongye XInxi Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2003, a joint directive declared that urban governments and public schools should be responsible for migrant children's equal access to education.&lt;ref name=paper7 /&gt;

Although there are various policies related to migrant children's education, in Hu's doctoral thesis, he addresses that the policy is partially implemented and the situation varies from province to province. Policy regarding funding is not being effectively implemented. Public schools don’t have enough funding and subsequently school access is still limited. In addition, migrant parents need to present a series of certificates showing that they have stable jobs and accommodation in cities in order to get their children admitted in public schools.&lt;ref name=Hu /&gt;

=== Hukou reform===
The Chinese government has committed to eliminating [[institutional discrimination]] of migrant workers on the grounds of hukou system.&lt;ref name=paper7 /&gt; But the [[reform]] is complicated since it involves restructuring political and social systems, which will impact every aspect including [[employment]], [[social security]] and [[property rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liu|first=Kaiming|title=An Investigative Report on a Case of Collective Labour Dispute: A Social Structure of Lost Entitlements|year=2005|publisher=Institute of Contemporary Observation: 11.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of the reform is to merge urban and rural hukou systems into one in which migrant workers can have equal access to public resources as urban residents do. At the beginning of the New Millennium, Fujian, Liaoning and Shandong Provinces abolished the dual-type hukou system and issued identical hukou status to both urban and rural residents. Up to 2008, twelve provinces had abolished the dual urban-rural hukou system. Due to the complication of this issue, however, it is still very difficult for migrant workers to gain access to [[social welfare]] in urban areas, though with a hukou reform. For example, some cities such as Zhengzhou once opened public schools to rural migrant children in 2002, but these cities soon realized that there were not enough schools for the large number of migrant children.&lt;ref name="working condition" /&gt; According to [[China Daily]], Huang Ming, vice-minister of public security, addressed that the national hukou reform would be done by 2020. He said in the interview that the new hukou system would gradually extend [[pension]], [[education]] and [[health care]] services to qualified residents, both urban and rural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=An|first=Baijie|title=Hukou Reforms Target 2020: Official|newspaper=China Daily|date=18 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's hukou system is a social management system. This system links every Chinese resident with their birthplace. One can only access their health care, pension and education for their children in their birth city.&lt;ref name="Staff"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2013/08/19/is-hukou-reform-the-key-to-reviving-chinas-economy/|title=Is Hukou Reform the Key to Reviving China's Economy?|last=Staff|first=W. S. J.|date=2013-08-18|website=WSJ|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cai Fang, director of the Insistute of Population Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, stated that migrant workers do not have the same benefits as the urban residents.&lt;ref name="Staff"/&gt; As a result of unequal benefits the migrant workers have limited participation in the labor market. Mr Cai estimates that more than 200 million migrant workers can't participate fully in the labor market due to the limitations from the Chinese hukou system.

==Sources and destinations==

===Internal Migration===
[[File:China administrative.gif|thumb|left|Map showing the various administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China.]]According to the International Labour Organization, internal migration in China is defined by two essential features. The first of these is that migrants generally move from farmlands and agricultural areas into more urban areas and developed cities. The second defining feature of Chinese internal migration is that "labour flows are basically directed from the interior to coastal areas, and/or from central and western regions to eastern areas." These are not independent characteristics; "These two features overlap, and are closely interrelated with the macro socio-economic structure.&lt;ref name="Labour migration"/&gt;

[[File:Badong-G209-5061.jpg|thumb|Migrants leaving [[Badong]] in mostly rural western [[Hubei]] for the provincial capital [[Wuhan]] with an overnight bus have to brave the rigors of [[China National Highway 209|Highway G209]].]]
The [[Fifth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China]] in 2000 counted 42.4 million people living outside of their home provinces (i.e., outside of the province where they were [[hukou system|legally domiciled]]). These would include e.g. migrant workers, students on campuses away from home, but not the military (who, generally, are counted separately from the provinces' and municipalities' populations). The largest migrant population was found in [[Guangdong]] (15.0 mln). The rest of China's southeastern seaboard attracted plenty of migrants as well ([[Shanghai]] (3.1 mln), Jiangsu (2.5 mln), [[Zhejiang]] (2.0 mln), [[Fujian]] (2.1 mln)); [[Beijing]] had 2.5 million. The coastal [[Liaoning]] and [[Shandong]], as well as the inland [[Yunnan]] and 
[[Xinjiang]] had over a million migrants each.
&lt;ref name="census2000.7-2"&gt;[http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/renkoupucha/2000pucha/html/t0702.htm http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/renkoupucha/2000pucha/html/t0106.htm 第五次人口普查数据(2000年). 表7—2    全国按现住地、户口登记地在外省分的人口] ([[Fifth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China]] (2000). Table 7-2: Population residing outside of the province of household registration.) {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migrants originated mostly in the inland provinces, such as [[Anhui]] (4.3 mln), [[Jiangxi]] (3.7 mln), [[Henan]] (3.1 mln), [[Hunan]] (4.3 mln), [[Hubei]] (2.8 mln), [[Guangxi]] (2.4 mln), [[Sichuan]] (6.9 mln).&lt;ref name="census2000.7-2"/&gt;

Much of the interprovincial migration was toward the neighboring wealthier provinces or municipalities if there was one. E.g., over 90% of the Guangxi migrants went to the nearby Guangdong, while over 60% of [[Hebei]] migrants went to the Beijing and [[Tianjin]] municipalities (which both are surrounded by Hebei's territory). On the other hand, among the Hubei migrants about one half went to Guangdong, and the rest mostly to various other coastal destinations, from Beijing to Fujian.&lt;ref name="census2000.7-2"/&gt;

It is of interest to the Chinese government to control the flow of internal migration in China. However, the flow of migration is large and widespread enough to be difficult for the government to manage. "Despite the Chinese government's policy of encouraging the development of western regions of the country, China's coastal regions, and especially the province of Guangdong, experienced the largest increase in the size of the floating population. With less than 7 percent of China's population, Guangdong has 27 percent of China's floating population. The size of the floating population in Guangdong nearly tripled between the 1990 and the 2000 censuses."&lt;ref name="Liang 2004 467–488"/&gt; Such uneven migration can hamper the government's policy to encourage the development of non-coastal regions, which exacerbates the geographic inequality in the country.

===Migration from neighboring countries===

====Vietnam====
China accepted 260,000 Vietnamese through the [[Orderly Departure Program]]  although this participation is less well known than that of other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Han|first1=Xiaorong|title=EXILED TO THE ANCESTRAL LAND: THE RESETTLEMENT, STRATIFICATION AND ASSIMILATION OF THE REFUGEES FROM VIETNAM IN CHINA|journal=International Journal of Asian Studies|date=18 January 2013|volume=10|issue=1|pages=25–46|doi=10.1017/S1479591412000228}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chinese government accorded the Vietnamese protection by providing them refugee status. Most refugees settled in southern China. During the time of the refugees’ integration, the Chinese government charged various agencies with examining the refugees’ background and labor skills to facilitate job placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cho|first1=Jeanyoung Jeannie|title=Systemizing the fate of the stateless North Korean migrant: a legal guide to preventing the automatic repatriation of North Korean migrants in China|journal=Fordham International Law Journal|date=November 1, 2013|volume=37|issue=1|pages=175–234|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2326&amp;context=ilj}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of the Orderly Departure Program in 1997, China continued to receive refugees although in much fewer numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Courtland|title=The curious case of North Korea|journal=Forced Migration Review|date=2013|volume=43|pages=53–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the end of the Program and after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Vietnamese refugees to China had already been decreasing in number.

====North Korea====
[[UNHCR]] has declared all North Koreans in China to be 'persons of concern', although China does not recognize North Koreans' claims to asylum as valid. China refuses to accept people who the country views as defectors from other Communist countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Choi|first1=Won Geun|title=China and its Janus-faced refugee policy|journal=Asian and Pacific Migration Journal|date=26 April 2017|volume=26|issue=2|pages=224–240|doi=10.1177/0117196817703759}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, China identifies North Koreans within its borders as “economic migrants.” Because of the Government of China does not provide assistance to migrants, the UNHCR established an office in Beijing in 1995 to provide direct assistance including food, shelter, health, education, and social services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Refugee Law and Policy: China|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/refugee-law/china.php|website=www.loc.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, China banned the UNHCR direct access to North Koreans, claiming that the issue was an internal matter and should be treated as such. Today, advocates for North Korean defectors lobby to government officials to reverse legal jargon.

The '''Mikkeli hostage crisis''' or '''Jakomäki bank robbery''' took place on 8th-9th August 1986, which ended dramatically in an explosion at the edge of [[Mikkeli]] Market, on Maaherrankatu near the crossroads of Raatihuoneenkatu. Helsinki-based Jorma Kalevi Takala (born July 11, 1950 in  Liperi)  took over three hostages in [[Helsinki]] in an [[bank robbery]] with whom he traveled by car to Mikkeli Market. The event ended when Takala  blow up his car and himself and  hostage driver Jukka Häkkinen (born May 13, 1961) in Mikkeli Market. This was an unprecedented crime in Finland's conditions and in its final solution. In the case of post-clearance reviews, the authorities were subjected to exceptionally harsh criticism.

== Events ==

The events began on August 8, when a man armed with a [[sawed-off shotgun]] and an [[explosive charge]] entered the [[Kansallis-Osake-Pankki]] bank in [[Jakomäki]], [[Helsinki]]. He took 12 people who were in the bank as his hostages. After receiving 2.5  million [[Finnish markka|Finnish marks]] and a getaway car in exchange for the hostages' lives, he left the bank with two female hostages and one male hostage. He forced the male hostage to drive the car. They drove to Mikkeli where they parked on a market place. The police surrounded the car and tried to negotiate with the hostage taker. Eventually the police advised the hostages to leave the car. Both female hostages escaped and after that the police started to shoot at the car. The hostage taker exploded the car, killing both himself and the male hostage.&lt;ref name="kronikka"&gt;[[Gummerus]] (1987). ''Vuosisatamme kronikka''.

== Aftermath ==

The police received much criticism for its handling of the hostage crisis. Nobody knew who gave the order to shoot at the car and initially none of the police commanders took the responsibility for the operation.&lt;ref name="mmm" /&gt; However, after an investigation by the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Finland)|National Bureau of Investigation]], [[Chancellor of Justice of Finland|Chancellor of Justice]] [[Jorma S. Aalto]] decided not to prosecute the police officers for the events.&lt;ref name="kronikka" /&gt; In 1993, the [[Supreme Court of Finland]] convicted one police officer who had participated in the operation of [[negligent homicide]] and fined him 6.000 [[Finnish markka|mk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/oikeus/kko/kko/1993/19930050 Supreme Court resolution 1993:50] Finlex.

The '''Monarchy of Greece''' ({{lang-el|Μοναρχία της Ελλάδας}}) or '''Greek Monarchy''' (Ελληνική Μοναρχία) was the government in which a hereditary monarch was the sovereign of the [[Kingdom of Greece]] from [[History of modern Greece|1832 to 1924 and 1935 to 1973]].

==History==
The Monarch of Greece was created by the [[London Conference of 1832]] at which the [[First Hellenic Republic]] was abolished.

In 1832 [[Otto, King of Greece|Prince Otto of Bavaria]] of the [[House of Wittelsbach]] was styled ''His Majesty Otto I, King of Greece'', over which he reigned for 30 years until he was deposed in 1862.

A [[Greek head of state referendum, 1862|head of state referendum was held in 1862]] to name a new King. Most of the Greek people wanted [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh]], to be the new King. He won the referendum by 230,016 against the [[Duke of Leuchtenberg]]. Alfred declined to be King, and so did every candidate until [[George I of the Hellenes|Prince Vilhelm of Denmark]] of the [[House of Glücksburg]], who had received six votes. Vilhelm was elected unanimously by the Greek Assembly, and became ''His Majesty George I, King of the [[Greeks|Hellenes]]''.

There was a [[Greek referendum, 1920|referendum in 1920]] to restore [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] as monarch, but four years later the [[Second Hellenic Republic]] was established and the monarchy was abolished following a [[Greek republic referendum, 1924|referendum in 1924]]. Then in 1935 the [[Greek monarchy referendum, 1935|Monarchy was restored after a referendum]] and maintained after a [[Greek referendum, 1946|referendum in 1946]].

In July 1973 the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|Greek military junta]] called a '[[Greek republic referendum, 1973|referendum]]', which abolished the Monarchy for the second time in Greek history. Then in 1974, the democratically elected Prime Minister, [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]], called a [[Greek republic referendum, 1974|referendum]] which formally abolished the Monarchy.

== Residences ==
[[Tatoi Palace|Tatoi]] was the private residence and 10,000-acre estate outside of Athens originally bought by [[George I of the Hellenes|King George I]] in the 1870s. The property was seized by the Republic following the 1974 referendum and has long been a contentious issue between the former Royal Family and the Greek state.

'''Mullazai''' (ملازئی) is a Baloch tribe found in  [[Panjgur District]] (پنجگور) of [[Balochistan, Pakistan]]. They are known as 'Mullas' and are descendants of Mir Mulla Shehsawar, who they claim to have migrated from [[Iran]] [[Sarbaz]] in 1513AD. The Mullazai tribe numbers in Panjgur are about 200 families or about 5000 persons.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Other tribes associated with the Mullazai settled in Panjgur, Mastung, Sorab, Kalat, Kharan, Quetta, Kucklak, Nushki, Dalbandin, Qandahar and Iran.&lt;ref name=wolf&gt;Wolfgang Weissleder, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JRyqfpi5BKcC&amp;pg The Nomadic Alternative] (Cambridge, Mouton Press: 1978), 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Mullazai in Balochi means descendants of mollas who was a religious man.

==Location==
Tasp is largest of the Panjgur townships and has a Mullazai population numbering around 600 families. Other places where the tribe have settled include Khubadan and Kallag. There, the tribe mainly work cultivating dates, amiraris. The date groves extend in places to nearly mile away from the river. Southwest of Tasp is Sorowan and has the Khushkawa, where some of the tribe still live.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==History==
[[File:Pajngur.jpg|thumb|The first Mosque Of Panjgur Built In 1513 By Mulla Shahsawar Mullazai]]
The first mosque in Panjgur was built in 1513 in Tasp By Mulla Shehsawar, an ancestor of the tribe.

The Mullazai are known as [[Akhoond]]s, Mala Zai, Mali Zai or Mollazahis Clans of the tribe include [[Kenagzai]], Halazai, [[Sahibzada]], Miazai, Gowarazai and Akundzai {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. These are the direct descendants of the tribe who left Iran and settled in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="wolf" /&gt; In northern [[Sarbaz County]] it consisted of 16 [[Rind (Baloch tribe)|Rind]], clans. They included [[Askani]], Bugani, Dagarani, Gazakandi, Gohramzai, Kahmaki, Kiazai, kolagi, [[Miranzai]], Mollahzehi, Nohani, Perozai, Shahalzai, Shahozai, and Mahair.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

==Economy==
The economy of the tribe in mainly depends on farming and engineering. Also, many of the inhabitants work in the local schools and hospitals as well as travel to work in the [[Royal Army of Oman]].

Mullazai are known{{By whom|date=October 2015}} for the connections with the Kalat State before 1947.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The annexation of Balochistan into Pakistan resulted in a turmoil in this region of Balochistan which largely affected the Mullazai tribe and it political grip, but with little impact on the socio-economic activities of the people.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Agriculture is dependent on the significant local rainfall and from [[tube well]]s. Many people from Tasp also work as contractors in [[Oman]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].

==Education==
There are institutions that range from primary to high school level. There is one High School for boys and one for girls. Every year those students who pass their examinations and continue on to higher education have to do so outside the Panjgur District. A late landlord Mir Haji Ghulam Jan Mullazai hoped to promote education in the area and donated property for the use of a high school for girls and for a primary school.

== Activity ==
In May 2013, the Caucus introduced a resolution at a New York City Council meeting calling for a Harriet Tubman to replace Andrew Jackson on the twenty-dollar bill, which was part of a larger nationwide initiative organized by a nonprofit called "Women on 20s".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/new-york-city-council-womens-caucus-wants-a-woman-on-the-twenty-dollar-bill-6691113|title=New York City Council Women's Caucus Wants a Woman on the Twenty-Dollar Bill|last=Zarum|first=Lara|date=2015-05-13|work=Village Voice|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, the Caucus presented a legislative package of 11 bills and resolutions to the New York City Council addressing equal rights and opportunities for women. Issues addressed in the package included the needs of unpaid caregivers, access to feminine hygiene products, services for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, the gender pay gap, as well as others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/6644-city-council-women-s-caucus-rallies-for-equity-legislation|title=City Council Women's Caucus Rallies for Equity Legislation|last=Nissinen|first=Devin Gannon &amp; Milka|work=Gotham Gazette|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stratigraphic]] sections of rock from this period reveal numerous other changes.&lt;ref name=McInerney2011/&gt; Fossil records for many organisms show major turnovers. For example, in the marine realm, a mass extinction of [[benthos|benthic]] [[foraminifera]], a global expansion of subtropical [[dinoflagellates]], and an appearance of excursion, planktic foraminifera and calcareous nanofossils all occurred during the beginning stages of PETM. On land, modern [[mammal]] orders (including primates) suddenly appear in Europe and in North America. Sediment deposition changed significantly at many [[outcrop]]s and in many drill cores spanning this time interval.

At least since 1997, the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum has become a focal point of considerable [[geoscience]] research because it probably provides the best past analog by which to understand [[effects of global warming|impacts of global climate warming]] and of massive carbon input to the ocean and atmosphere, including [[ocean acidification]].&lt;ref name=Dickens1&gt;{{cite journal

{{Paleogene graphical timeline}}

==Setting==
The configuration of oceans and continents was somewhat different during the early [[Paleogene]] relative to the present day. The [[Panama Isthmus]] did not yet connect [[North America]] and [[South America]], and this allowed direct low-latitude circulation between the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]]s. The [[Drake Passage]], which now separates [[South America]] and [[Antarctica]], was closed, and this perhaps prevented thermal isolation of Antarctica. The [[Arctic]] was also more restricted. Although various proxies for past atmospheric {{co2}} levels in the Eocene do not agree in absolute terms, all suggest that levels then were much higher than at present. In any case, there were no significant ice sheets during this time.&lt;ref name=Zachos2008&gt;{{cite journal

Earth surface temperatures increased by about 6&amp;nbsp;°C from the late Paleocene through the early Eocene, culminating in the "Early Eocene Climatic Optimum" (EECO).&lt;ref name=Zachos2008/&gt; Superimposed on this long-term, gradual warming were at least two (and probably more) "hyperthermals". These can be defined as geologically brief (&lt;200,000 year) events characterized by rapid global warming, major changes in the environment, and massive carbon addition. Of these, the PETM was the most extreme and perhaps the first (at least within the [[Cenozoic]]). Another hyperthermal clearly occurred at approximately 53.7 Ma, and is now called [[Eocene Thermal Maximum 2|ETM-2]] (also referred to as H-1, or the Elmo event). However, additional hyperthermals probably occurred at about 53.6 Ma (H-2), 53.3 (I-1), 53.2 (I-2) and 52.8 Ma (informally called K, X or ETM-3). The number, nomenclature, absolute ages, and relative global impact of the Eocene hyperthermals are the source of considerable current research. Whether they only occurred during the long-term warming, and whether they are causally related to apparently similar events in older intervals of the geological record (e.g. the [[Toarcian turnover]] of the [[Jurassic]]) are open issues.

Acidification of deep waters, and the later spreading from the North Atlantic can explain spatial variations in carbonate dissolution. Model simulations show acidic water accumulation in the deep North Atlantic at the onset of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v8/n6/full/ngeo2430.html?WT.ec_id=NGEO-201506|doi=10.1038/ngeo2430|author=Kaitlin Alexander|author2=Katrin J.

==Evidence for global warming==

At the start of the PETM, average global temperatures increased by approximately 6&amp;nbsp;°C (11&amp;nbsp;°F) within about 20,000&amp;nbsp;years. This warming was superimposed on "long-term" [[Climate across Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary|early Paleogene warming]], and is based on several lines of evidence. There is a prominent (&gt;1[[Per mil|‰]]) negative excursion in the {{delta|18|O|link}} of foraminifera shells, both those made in surface and deep ocean water. Because there was a paucity of continental ice in the early Paleogene, the shift in {{delta|18|O|}} very probably signifies a rise in ocean temperature.&lt;ref name=Thomas1996&gt;{{Cite journal

The temperature rise is also supported by analyses of fossil assemblages, the Mg/Ca ratios of foraminifera, and the ratios of certain [[organic compound]]s, such as [[TEX86|TEX&lt;sub&gt;86&lt;/sub&gt;]].

Precise limits on the global temperature rise during the PETM and whether this varied significantly with latitude remain open issues. Oxygen isotope and Mg/Ca of carbonate shells precipitated in surface waters of the ocean are commonly used measurements for reconstructing past temperature; however, both paleotemperature proxies can be compromised at low latitude locations, because re-crystallization of carbonate on the seafloor renders lower values than when formed. On the other hand, these and other temperature proxies (e.g., TEX&lt;sub&gt;86&lt;/sub&gt;) are impacted at high latitudes because of seasonality; that is, the “temperature recorder” is biased toward summer, and therefore higher values, when the production of carbonate and organic carbon occurred.

Certainly, the central Arctic Ocean was ice-free before, during, and after the PETM. This can be ascertained from the composition of sediment cores recovered during the Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX) at 87°N on [[Lomonosov Ridge]].&lt;ref name=Moran2006&gt;{{Cite journal

Assuming the TEX&lt;sub&gt;86&lt;/sub&gt; record reflects summer temperatures, it still implies much warmer temperatures on the North Pole compared to the present day, but no significant latitudinal amplification relative to surrounding time.

The above considerations are important because, in many global warming simulations, high latitude temperatures increase much more at the poles through an [[ice-albedo feedback]].&lt;ref name=Shellito2003&gt;{{Cite journal

==Evidence for carbon addition==
Clear evidence for massive addition of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-depleted carbon at the onset of the PETM comes from two observations. First, a prominent negative excursion in the carbon isotope composition ({{delta|13|C|}}) of carbon-bearing phases characterizes the PETM in numerous (&gt;130) widespread locations from a range of environments.&lt;ref name=McInerney2011/&gt; Second, carbonate dissolution marks the PETM in sections from the deep sea.

The total mass of carbon injected to the ocean and atmosphere during the PETM remains the source of debate. In theory, it can be estimated from the magnitude of the negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE), the amount of carbonate dissolution on the seafloor, or ideally both.&lt;ref name=Dickens1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zeebe2009 /&gt; However, the shift in the {{delta|13|C|}} across the PETM depends on the location and the carbon-bearing phase analyzed. In some records of bulk carbonate, it is about 2‰ (per mil); in some records of terrestrial carbonate or organic matter it exceeds 6‰.&lt;ref name=McInerney2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Norris1999&gt;{{cite journal

==Comparison with today's climate change==

==Timing of carbon addition and warming==
The timing of the PETM {{delta|13|C|}} excursion is of considerable interest. This is because the total duration of the CIE, from the rapid drop in {{delta|13|C|}} through the near recovery to initial conditions, relates to key parameters of our global carbon cycle, and because the onset provides insight to the source of [[Carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]]-depleted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The total duration of the CIE can be estimated in several ways. The iconic sediment interval for examining and dating the PETM is a core recovered in 1987 by the [[Ocean Drilling Program]] at Hole 690B at [[Maud Rise]] in the South Atlantic Ocean. At this location, the PETM CIE, from start to end, spans about 2 m.&lt;ref name=Kennett1991/&gt; Long-term age constraints, through biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy, suggest an average Paleogene sedimentation rate of about 1.23&amp;nbsp;cm/1,000yrs. Assuming a constant sedimentation rate, the entire event, from onset though termination, was therefore estimated at about 200,000 years.&lt;ref name=Kennett1991/&gt; Subsequently, it was noted that the CIE spanned 10 or 11 subtle cycles in various sediment properties, such as Fe content. Assuming these cycles represent precession, a similar but slightly longer age was calculated by Rohl et al. 2000.&lt;ref name=Rohl2000&gt;{{cite journal

If a massive amount of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-depleted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is rapidly injected into the modern ocean or atmosphere and projected into the future, a ~200,000 year CIE results because of slow flushing through quasi steady-state inputs (weathering and volcanism) and outputs (carbonate and organic) of carbon.

The above approach can be performed at many sections containing the PETM. This has led to an intriguing result.&lt;ref name=Giusberti2007&gt;{{cite journal

Age constraints at several deep-sea sites have been independently examined using &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He contents, assuming the flux of this cosmogenic nuclide is roughly constant over short time periods.&lt;ref name=Farley2003&gt;{{cite journal

This approach also suggests a rapid onset for the PETM CIE (&lt;20,000 years). However, the &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He records support a faster recovery to near initial conditions (&lt;100,000 years)&lt;ref name=Farley2003/&gt; than predicted by flushing via weathering inputs and carbonate and organic outputs.

There is other evidence to suggest that warming predated the {{delta|13|C|}} excursion by some 3,000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=Sluijs2007&gt;{{cite journal

===Ocean===
The amount of [[freshwater]] in the Arctic Ocean increased, in part due to northern hemisphere rainfall patterns, fueled by poleward storm track migrations under global warming conditions.&lt;ref name=Pagani2006/&gt;

====Anoxia====
{{Main|Anoxic event}}
In parts of the oceans, especially the north Atlantic Ocean, [[bioturbation]] was absent. This may be due to [[anoxic event|bottom-water anoxia]], or by changing ocean circulation patterns changing the temperatures of the bottom water. However, many ocean basins remained bioturbated through the PETM.&lt;ref name=Zachos2005/&gt;

====Sea level====
{{Main|Past sea level#Changes through geologic time|Sea level rise}}
Despite the global lack of ice, the sea level would have risen due to thermal expansion.&lt;ref name=Sluijs2006/&gt;

The [[lysocline]] marks the depth at which carbonate starts to dissolve (above the lysocline, carbonate is oversaturated): today, this is at about 4&amp;nbsp;km, comparable to the median depth of the oceans.

====Ocean====
The PETM is accompanied by a [[mass extinction]] of 35-50% of [[wikt:benthic|benthic]] [[foraminifera]] (especially in deeper waters) over the course of ~1,000 years – the group suffering more than during the dinosaur-slaying [[K-T extinction]] (e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, E., 1989.

Contrarily, planktonic foraminifera diversified, and [[dinoflagellates]] bloomed. Success was also enjoyed by the [[mammal]]s, who radiated extensively around this time.

The deep-sea extinctions are difficult to explain, because many species of benthic foraminifera in the deep-sea are cosmopolitan, and can find refugia against local extinction.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, E., 2007.

Rampino, eds., "Large Ecosystem Perturbations: Causes and Consequences", Geological Society of America Special Paper, 424: 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; General hypotheses such as a temperature-related reduction in oxygen availability, or increased corrosion due to carbonate undersaturated deep waters, are insufficient as explanations. Acidification may also have played a role in the extinction of the calcifying foraminifera,  and the higher temperatures would have increased metabolic rates, thus demanding a higher food supply. Such a higher food supply might not have materialized because warming and increased ocean stratification might have led to declining productivity &lt;ref&gt;Winguth, A., Thomas, E., and Winguth, C., 2012.

===Temperature===
Proxy data from one of the studied sites show rapid +8&amp;nbsp;°C temperature rise, in accordance with existing regional records of marine and terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name=Adatte2014 /&gt; Notable is the absence of documented greater warming in polar regions. This implies a non existing ice-albedo feedback, suggesting no sea or land ice was present in the late Paleocene.&lt;ref name=Bowen2015 /&gt;

===Terrestrial===
During the PETM, sediments are enriched with [[kaolinite]] from a [[detrital]] source due to  [[denudation]] (initial processes such as [[volcanoes]], [[earthquakes]], and [[plate tectonics]]). This suggests increased precipitation, and enhanced erosion of older kaolinite-rich soils and sediments. Increased weathering from the enhanced runoff formed thick paleosoil enriched with [[Concretion|carbonate nodules]] ([[Microcodium]] like), and this suggests a [[semi-arid climate]].&lt;ref name=Adatte2014 /&gt;

==Possible causes==
Discriminating between different possible causes of the PETM is difficult. Temperatures were rising globally at a steady pace, and a mechanism must be invoked to produce an instantaneous spike which may have been accentuated by positive feedbacks. The biggest aid in disentangling these factors comes from a consideration of the carbon isotope mass balance. We know the entire [[wikt:exogenic|exogenic]] [[carbon cycle]] (i.e. the carbon contained within the oceans and atmosphere, which can change on short timescales) underwent a &amp;minus;0.2&amp;nbsp;% to &amp;minus;0.3&amp;nbsp;% perturbation in {{delta|13|C|}}, and by considering the isotopic signatures of other carbon reserves, can consider what mass of the reserve would be necessary to produce this effect. The assumption underpinning this approach is that the mass of exogenic carbon was the same in the [[Paleogene]] as it is today – something which is very difficult to confirm.

===Eruption of large kimberlite field===
Although the cause of the initial warming has been attributed to a massive injection of carbon (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and/or CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) into the atmosphere, the source of the carbon has yet to be found. The emplacement of a large cluster of [[kimberlite]] pipes at ~56 Ma in the [[Lac de Gras]] region of northern Canada may have provided the carbon that triggered early warming in the form of exsolved magmatic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Calculations indicate that the estimated 900-1,100 Pg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carozza|first1=D. A.|last2=Mysak|first2=L. A.|last3=Schmidt|first3=G.

The coeval ages of two other kimberlite clusters in the Lac de Gras field and two other early Cenozoic hyperthermals indicate that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; degassing during kimberlite emplacement is a plausible source of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; responsible for these sudden global warming events.

===Volcanic activity===
[[Image:Wfm ardnamurchan landsat.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite photo of [[Ardnamurchan]] – with clearly visible circular shape, which is the 'plumbings of an ancient volcano']]
To balance the mass of carbon and produce the observed {{delta|13|C|}} value, at least 1,500 gigatons of carbon would have to degas from the mantle via volcanoes over the course of the two, 1,000 year, steps. To put this in perspective, this is about 200 times the background rate of degassing for the rest of the Paleocene. There is no indication that such a burst of volcanic activity has occurred at any point in Earth's history. However, substantial volcanism had been active in East Greenland for around the preceding million years or so, but this struggles to explain the rapidity of the PETM. Even if the bulk of the 1,500 gigatons of carbon was released in a single pulse, further feedbacks would be necessary to produce the observed isotopic excursion.

On the other hand, there are suggestions that surges of activity occurred in the later stages of the volcanism and associated continental rifting. Intrusions of hot magma into carbon-rich sediments may have triggered the degassing of isotopically light methane in sufficient volumes to cause global warming and the observed isotope anomaly. This hypothesis is documented by the presence of extensive intrusive sill complexes and thousands of kilometer-sized hydrothermal vent complexes in sedimentary basins on the mid-Norwegian margin and west of Shetland.&lt;ref name=Svensen2004&gt;{{cite journal

Large-scale volcanic activity may last only a few days, but the massive outpouring of gases and ash can influence climate patterns for years.  Sulfuric gases convert to sulfate aerosols, sub-micron droplets containing about 75 percent sulfuric acid. Following eruptions, these aerosol particles can linger as long as three to four years in the stratosphere.&lt;ref name=Wolfe2000&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Volcano/ |title=Volcanoes and Climate Change |publisher=NASA |work=Earth Observatory |author=Jason Wolfe |date=5 September 2000 |accessdate=19 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comet impact===
A briefly popular theory held that a &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C-rich comet struck the earth and initiated the warming event. A cometary impact coincident with the P/E boundary can also help explain some enigmatic features associated with this event, such as the iridium anomaly at [[Zumaia]], the abrupt appearance of kaolinitic clays with abundant magnetic nanoparticles on the coastal shelf of New Jersey, and especially the nearly simultaneous onset of the carbon isotope excursion and the thermal maximum. Indeed, a key feature and testable prediction of a comet impact is that it should produce virtually instantaneous environmental effects in the atmosphere and surface ocean with later repercussions in the deeper ocean.&lt;ref name=Kent2003&gt;{{cite journal

===Burning of peat===
The combustion of prodigious quantities of [[peat]] was once postulated, because there was probably a greater mass of carbon stored as living terrestrial biomass during the Paleocene than there is today since plants in fact grew more vigorously during the period of the PETM. This theory was refuted, because in order to produce the {{delta|13|C|}} excursion observed, over 90% of the Earth's biomass would have to have been combusted.  However, the Paleocene is also recognized as a time of significant peat accumulation worldwide. A comprehensive search failed to find evidence for the combustion of fossil organic matter, in the form of soot or similar particulate carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =  Moore, E| year =  2008| doi = 10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.06.010 | title =  Black carbon in Paleocene-Eocene boundary sediments: A test of biomass combustion as the PETM trigger | journal =   	Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume =  267 | issue =  1–2 | pages =  147–152 | last2 =  Kurtz | first2 =  Andrew C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbital forcing===
The presence of later (smaller) warming events of a global scale, such as the [[Elmo horizon]] (aka [[Eocene Thermal Maximum 2|ETM2]]), has led to the hypothesis that the events repeat on a regular basis, driven by maxima in the 400,000 and 100,000 year eccentricity [[Milankovic cycles|cycles]] in the [[Earth's orbit]]. The current warming period is expected to last another 50,000 years due to a minimum in the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit. Orbital increase in insolation (and thus temperature) would force the system over a threshold and unleash positive feedbacks.&lt;ref name=Lourens2005&gt;{{cite journal

===Methane release===
{{synthesis|date=January 2016}}
None of the above causes are alone sufficient to cause the carbon isotope excursion or warming observed at the PETM. The most obvious feedback mechanism that could amplify the initial perturbation is that of [[methane clathrate]]s. Under certain temperature and pressure conditions, methane &amp;ndash; which is being produced continually by decomposing microbes in sea bottom sediments &amp;ndash; is stable in a complex with water, which forms ice-like cages trapping the methane in solid form. As temperature rises, the pressure required to keep this clathrate configuration stable increases, so shallow clathrates dissociate, releasing methane gas to make its way into the atmosphere. Since biogenic clathrates have a {{delta|13|C|}} signature of &amp;minus;60&amp;nbsp;‰ (inorganic clathrates are the still rather large &amp;minus;40&amp;nbsp;‰), relatively small masses can produce large {{delta|13|C|}} excursions. Further, methane is a potent [[greenhouse gas]] as it is released into the atmosphere, so it causes warming, and as the ocean transports this warmth to the bottom sediments, it destabilizes more clathrates. It would take around 2,300 years for an increased temperature to diffuse warmth into the sea bed to a depth sufficient to cause a release of clathrates, although the exact time-frame is highly dependent on a number of poorly constrained assumptions.&lt;ref name=Katz2001&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ocean warming due to flooding and pressure changes due to a sea-level drop may have caused clathrates to become unstable and release methane. This can take place over as short of a period as a few thousand years. The reverse process, that of fixing methane in clathrates, occurs over a larger scale of tens of thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In order for the clathrate hypothesis to work, the oceans must show signs of having been warmer slightly before the carbon isotope excursion, because it would take some time for the methane to become mixed into the system and {{delta|13|C|}}-reduced carbon to be returned to the deep ocean sedimentary record. Until recently, the evidence suggested that the two peaks were in fact simultaneous, weakening the support for the methane theory. But recent (2002) work has managed to detect a short gap between the initial warming and the {{delta|13|C|}} excursion.&lt;ref name=Thomas2002&gt;{{cite journal

The {{delta|18|O|}} of benthic or planktonic forams does not show any pre-warming in any of these localities, and in an ice-free world, it is generally a much more reliable indicator of past ocean temperatures.

Analysis of these records reveals another interesting fact: planktonic (floating) forams record the shift to lighter isotope values earlier than benthic (bottom dwelling) forams. The lighter (lower {{delta|13|C|}}) methanogenic carbon can only be incorporated into the forams' shells after it has been oxidised. A gradual release of the gas would allow it to be oxidised in the deep ocean, which would make benthic forams show lighter values earlier. The fact that the planktonic forams are the first to show the signal suggests that the methane was released so rapidly that its oxidation used up all the oxygen at depth in the water column, allowing some methane to reach the atmosphere unoxidised, where atmospheric oxygen would react with it. This observation also allows us to constrain the duration of methane release to under around 10,000 years.&lt;ref name=Thomas2002/&gt;

However, there are several major problems with the methane hydrate dissociation hypothesis. The most parsimonious interpretation for surface-water forams to show the {{delta|13|C|}} excursion before their benthic counterparts (as in the Thomas et al. paper) is that the perturbation occurred from the top down, and not the bottom up.  If the anomalous {{delta|13|C|}} (in whatever form: CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) entered the atmospheric carbon reservoir first, and then diffused into the surface ocean waters, which mix with the deeper ocean waters over much longer time-scales, we would expect to observe the planktonics shifting toward lighter values before the benthics.  Moreover, careful examination of the Thomas et al. data set shows that there is not a single intermediate planktonic foram value, implying that the perturbation and attendant {{delta|13|C|}} anomaly happened over the lifespan of a single foram – much too fast for the nominal 10,000-year release needed for the methane hypothesis to work.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

There is a debate about whether there was a large enough amount of methane hydrate to be a major carbon source; a recent paper proposed that was the case.&lt;ref name=Gu2011&gt;{{cite journal

However, because the global ocean bottom temperatures were ~6&amp;nbsp;°C higher than today, which implies a much smaller volume of sediment hosting gas hydrate than today, the global amount of hydrate before the PETM has been thought to be much less than present-day estimates. in a 2006 study, scientists regarded the source of carbon for the PETM to be a mystery.&lt;ref name=Pagani_Science_2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pagani|first=Mark|author2=Caldeira, K. |author3=Archer, D. |author4= Zachos, J.C. |title=An Ancient Carbon Mystery|journal=Science|date=8 December 2006|volume=314|pages=1556–7|doi=10.1126/science.1136110|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5805/1556.full|issue=5805|pmid=17158314}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2011 study, using numerical simulations suggests that enhanced organic carbon [[sedimentation]] and [[methanogenesis]] could have compensated for the smaller volume of hydrate stability.&lt;ref name=Gu2011/&gt;

===Ocean circulation===
The large scale patterns of ocean circulation are important when considering how heat was transported through the oceans. Our understanding of these patterns is still in a preliminary stage. Models show that there are possible mechanisms to quickly transport heat to the shallow, clathrate-containing ocean shelves, given the right bathymetric profile, but the models cannot yet match the distribution of data we observe.  "Warming accompanying a south-to-north switch in deepwater formation would produce sufficient warming to destabilize seafloor gas hydrates over most of the world ocean to a water depth of at least 1900 m."&lt;ref name=Bice2002 /&gt; This destabilization could have resulted in the release of more than 2000 gigatons of methane gas from the clathrate zone of the ocean floor.&lt;ref name=Bice2002&gt;{{cite journal

==Recovery==
[[Proxy (climate)|Climate proxies]], such as ocean sediments (depositional rates) indicate a duration of ∼83 ka, with ∼33 ka
in the early rapid phase and ∼50 ka in a subsequent gradual phase.&lt;ref name=McInerney2011/&gt;

The most likely method of recovery involves an increase in biological productivity, transporting carbon to the deep ocean. This would be assisted by higher global temperatures and {{co2}} levels, as well as an increased nutrient supply (which would result from higher continental weathering due to higher temperatures and rainfall; volcanoes may have provided further nutrients). Evidence for higher biological productivity comes in the form of bio-concentrated [[barium]].&lt;ref name=Bains2000&gt;{{cite journal

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |Population}}

'''Palestinian Jews''' were [[Jews|Jewish]] inhabitants of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (known in [[Hebrew]] as ''Eretz Israel'', the "[[Land of Israel]]") prior to the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|establishment]] of the modern state of [[Israel]].

The common term for the Jewish community of [[Ottoman Syria]] during the 19th century,&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite web|title=Yishuv |work=Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |date= |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/yishuv |accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mandatory Palestine|British Palestine]] prior to the establishment of the State of Israel&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; is ''[[Yishuv]]'' ("settlement"). A distinction is drawn between the "New Yishuv", largely composed of and descended from immigrants after the [[First Aliyah]] in 1881, and the "[[Old Yishuv]]", the pre-existing Jewish community of Palestine prior to the First Aliyah.

In addition to applying to Jews who lived in Palestine during the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate]] era, the term "Palestinian Jews" has also been applied to Jewish residents of [[Southern Syria]], the southern part of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] province of [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]], and there are scholarly instances of referring to the Jews of the [[Palaestina Prima]] and [[Palaestina Secunda]] provinces (4th to 7th centuries CE) of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Late Antiquity]] as "Palestinian Jews".{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

After the establishment of Israel in 1948, the Jews of Mandatory Palestine became [[Israeli nationality law|Israeli citizens]], and the term "Palestinian Jews" has largely fallen into disuse and is somewhat defunct, in favor of the term [[Israeli Jews]].

Prior to dismemberment of the [[Ottoman Empire]], the population of the area comprising modern Israel, the [[West Bank]], and [[Gaza Strip]] was not exclusively Muslim.  Under the Empire's rule in the mid-16th century, there were no more than 10,000 Jews in Palestine,&lt;ref name=Petersp287&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5-Q1h2hONGMC&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=mustarabim&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=mustarabim&amp;f=false|title=The Monotheists: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Conflict and Competition, Volume II: The Words and Will of God|first1=Francis E.|last1=Peters|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2005|ISBN=978-0-691-12373-8|page= 287}}&lt;/ref&gt; making up around 5% of the population. By the mid-19th century, Turkish sources recorded that 80% of the population of 600,000 was identified as Muslim, 10% as Christian Arab and 5–7% as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zvo6KRkRTvUC&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Israel and the American National Interest: A Critical Examination|last=Rubenberg|first=Cheryl A.|page=26|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-252-06074-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation of the Jewish community in Palestine was more complicated than in neighbouring [[Arab countries]].&lt;ref name=Tamari/&gt; Whereas in [[Yemen]], [[Iraq]], [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], communities were largely homogeneous in ethnic and confessional terms, in Palestine in the 19th century, Jewish pilgrims and European Christian colonial projects attracted large numbers of Ashkenazi immigrants from Eastern Europe and Sephardic groups from [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]] and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref name=Tamari/&gt; The Jews of Palestine were not exclusively of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] origins, and included substantial Yiddish speaking communities who had established themselves in Palestine centuries earlier.&lt;ref name=Tamari/&gt;

Towards the end of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman era]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], native Jewish communities lived primarily in the four 'holy cities' of [[Safed]], [[Tiberias]], [[Hebron]] and [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=Tamari/&gt; The Jewish population consisted of Ashkenazim (Judeo-German speakers) and Sephardim, the latter of which could be further subdivided as Sephardim proper (Judeo-Spanish speakers) and Maghrebim (North African Arabic speakers) or Mizrahim (Middle Eastern Jews, comparable to the Arabic term "Mashriqiyyun", or Easterners). The majority of Jews in the four holy cities, with the exception of Jerusalem, were [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Judaeo-Spanish]] speakers.&lt;ref name=Tamari/&gt; The dominant language among Jews in Jerusalem was [[Yiddish]], due to the large migration of pious Ashkenazi Jews from [[Russia]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. Still, in 1882, there were 7,620 Sephardim in Jerusalem, of whom 1,290 were Maghrebim, from the [[Maghreb]] or North Africa. Natives of the city, they were Turkish subjects, and fluent in Arabic.&lt;ref name=Tamari/&gt; Arabic also served as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' between the Sephradim/Mizrahim/Maghrebim  and Ashkenazim and their non-Jewish Arab counterparts in mixed cities like Safed and Hebron.&lt;ref name=Tamari/&gt;  However, during the Greek and Roman period, the primary language of Palestinian Jews was [[Aramaic]], a Semitic language closely related to Hebrew. &lt;ref&gt;E.P. Sanders, Jaroslav Jan Pelikan (2015). Encyclopedia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jesus&lt;/ref&gt;

In the narrative works of Arabs in Palestine in the late Ottoman period, as evidenced in the autobiographies and diaries of [[Khalil al-Sakakini]] and [[Wasif Jawhariyyeh]], "native" Jews were often referred to and described as ''abnaa al-balad'' (sons of the country), 'compatriots', or ''Yahud awlad Arab'' (Jews, sons of Arabs).&lt;ref name=Tamari/&gt; When the First Palestinian Congress of February 1919 issued its [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] manifesto rejecting [[Zionism|Zionist]] immigration, it extended a welcome to those Jews "among us who have been [[Arabization|Arabicized]], who have been living in our province since before the war; they are as we are, and their loyalties are our own."&lt;ref name=Tamari&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ishaq al-Shami and the Predicament of the Arab Jew in Palestine|author=Salim Tamari|authorlink=Salim Tamari|publisher=[[Jerusalem Quarterly]]|accessdate=2007-08-23|url=http://www.jerusalemquarterly.org/pdfs/predicament.pdf|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928031156/http://www.jerusalemquarterly.org/pdfs/predicament.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reference to European Jews as "Palestinians" prior to 1948==
[[Europe]]an Jews were commonly considered an "Oriental" people in many of their host countries, usually as reference to their ancestral origins in the Middle East. A prominent example of this is [[Immanuel Kant]], an (18th-century [[Prussia]]n philosopher) who referred to European Jews as "Palestinians living among us."&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant|Kant, Immanuel]] (1974): ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View.'' Translated by Mary J. Gregor. The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, cited in Chad Alan Goldberg, ''[http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~cgoldber/Web%20Class/Goldberg2005a.pdf Politicide Revisited]''. University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming of "Israel" in Arabic==
Official documents released in April 2013 by the State Archive of Israel show that days before the establishment of the State of Israel in May 1948, Jewish officials were still debating about what the new country would be called in Arabic: Palestine (Filastin), Zion (Sahyoun) or Israel (Isra’il).  Two assumptions were made: "That an Arab state was about to be established alongside the Jewish one in keeping with the UN’s partition resolution the year before, and that the Jewish state would include a large Arab minority whose feelings needed to be taken into account".  In the end, the officials rejected the name Palestine because they thought that would be the name of the new Arab state and could cause confusion so they opted for the most straightforward option: Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/leaders-grappled-over-arabic-name-for-fledgling-state/|title=Why Israel's first leaders chose not to call the country 'Palestine' in Arabic - The Times of Israel|work=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispute over usage of the term "Palestinian Jew"==
{{See also|Definitions of Palestinian}}

===PLO usage===
The [[Palestinian National Charter]], as amended by the PLO's [[Palestinian National Council]] in July 1968, defined "Palestinians" as "those Arab nationals who, until 1947, normally resided in Palestine regardless of whether they were evicted from it or stayed there. Anyone born, after that date, of a Palestinian father—whether in Palestine or outside it—is also a Palestinian. The Jews who had normally resided in Palestine until the beginning of the Zionist invasion will be considered Palestinians."&lt;ref name ="charter"&gt;{{cite web |title = The Palestinian National Charter: Resolutions of the Palestine National Council July 1-17, 1968: Articles 6-7| url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/plocov.asp| accessdate= 22 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Israeli usage===
[[Yaakov Meir]] (born in 1856 in Jerusalem), the first [[Sephardic]] [[Chief Rabbi]] appointed in [[Mandatory Palestine]], preferred not to use the term "Palestinian Jew" due to his [[Zionist]] affiliations. He spoke fluent [[Hebrew]] and encouraged the construction of new Jewish quarters of Jerusalem as well as the re-establishment of an Independent Israeli Jewish State.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Isaiah Friedman, Germany, Turkey, and Zionism 1897-1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel]] (Born in 1880 in Jerusalem), was the Sephardi chief rabbi of Mandatory Palestine from 1939 to 1948, and of Israel from 1948 to 1954. He served as a Mizrahi delegate to the Zionist Congress from 1925-46. As a religious [[Zionist]], he strongly believed in the redemption of Israel and bringing the Jewish exiles back to the land to create a religious Jewish state of Israel. As a strong supporter of Israeli nationalism, in his writing ''The Redemption of Israel'' he wrote: "We all desire that the in gathering of the exiles should take place from all areas where they have been scattered; and that our holy language will be upon our lips and upon the lips of our children, in building the Land and its flowering through the hands and work of Israel; and we will all strive to see the flag of freedom and redemption waving in glory and strength upon the walls of Jerusalem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mizrachi.org/rav-ben-zion-meir-hai-uziel-1880-1953/|title=Rav Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel (1880-1953)|work=mizrachi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mordechai Eliyahu]] (Born in Jerusalem March 3, 1929 – June 7, 2010) was a prominent [[rabbi]], [[posek]] and spiritual leader. He served as the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel from 1983 to 1993. Because Eliyahu was one of the spiritual leaders of the Religious Zionist movement he refused to use the term "Palestinian" and believed all Jews should refrain from using the term. He was an outspoken opponent of the Gaza Disengagement of 2005 and supported Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West Bank ([[Judea and Samaria]]). He was considered somewhat controversial for his decades-long support of the radical right of the Religious Zionist movement. Eliyahu was a friend of Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]] and his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/2006/03/exchief_rabbi_m.html|title=Ex-Chief Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu: Any PM Who Carries Out Disengagement Will Disengage From This World - FailedMessiah.com|work=typepad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uri Davis]], an [[Israel]]i citizen, academic, activist and observer-member in the [[Palestinian National Council]] living in the Arab town of [[Sakhnin]], identified himself as an "anti-Zionist Palestinian Hebrew". Davis explained, "I don’t describe myself as a Palestinian Hebrew, but I actually happen to be a Palestinian Hebrew, I was born in [[Jerusalem]] in 1943 in a country called Palestine and the title of my birth certificate is 'Government of Palestine'. That is neither here nor there, though. It is significant only in a political context in which I am situated, and the political context that is relevant to my work, my advocacy of a critique of [[Zionism]]. I'm an [[anti-Zionist]]."&lt;ref name="catholic"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Kevin Spurgaitis |title=Palestinian Jew Speaks Out Against ‘Apartheid State’ |url=http://lists.portside.org/cgi-bin/listserv/wa?A2=ind0411c&amp;L=portside&amp;T=0&amp;P=1486 |work=Catholic New Times |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since converted to Islam in 2008 to marry a Palestinian Muslim woman Miyassar Abu Ali whom he met in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/sep/01/uri-davis-fatah-israel | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The lonely struggle of Uri Davis | first=Seth | last=Freedman | date=2009-09-01 | accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uridavis.info/&lt;/ref&gt; Since then he no longer considers himself Jewish.

[[Tali Fahima]], an Israeli pro-Palestinian activist, describes her nationality as Palestinian. Fahima was born in [[Kiryat Gat]], a development town in the south of Israel, to a family of [[History of the Jews in Morocco|Algerian Jewish]] origin. Fahima lives in the Arab village [[Ar'ara]] in northern Israel, and works as a [[Hebrew]] teacher. In June 2010, it was reported that she converted to [[Islam]] at a mosque in [[Umm al-Fahm]].

The actor, director and activist [[Juliano Mer-Khamis]], the son of an Israeli Jewish mother and a [[Palestinian Arabs|Palestinian]] father, described himself in a 2009 interview with [[Israel Army Radio]] as "100 percent Palestinian Arab and 100 percent Jewish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dahlah|first=Saif|title=Jewish-Arab director shot dead in northern West Bank|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jFrWGB9wisFa6dBuQfyA4ePnSqig?docId=CNG.3d99b443b15130c2e8940c31d981a03e.8d1|publisher=Agence France Presse|accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Privacy by design''' is an approach to [[systems engineering]] initially developed by [[Ann Cavoukian]] and formalized in a joint report on [[privacy-enhancing technologies]] by a joint team of the [[Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario]] (Canada), the [[Dutch Data Protection Authority]] and the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hes|first=R|title=Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/library/repository/mon/10000/184530.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deliveringthepromises"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hustinx|first=Peter|title=Privacy by Design: Delivering the Promises|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12394-010-0061-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; The privacy by design framework was published in 2009&lt;ref name=7principles/&gt; and adopted by the International Assembly of Privacy Commissioners and Data Protection Authorities in 2010.&lt;ref name=resolution/&gt; Privacy by design calls for [[privacy]] to be taken into account throughout the whole engineering process. The concept is an example of [[value sensitive design]], i.e., to take human values into account in a well-defined manner throughout the whole process and may have been derived from this.

Cavoukian's approach to privacy has been criticized as being vague&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, difficult to enforce its adoption&lt;ref name=Counterfactual&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, difficult to apply to certain disciplines&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as prioritizing corporate interests over consumers' interests&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt; and placing insufficient emphasis on minimizing data collection&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"/&gt;.

The European [[GDPR]] regulation incorporates privacy by design.&lt;ref name=Opinion/&gt;

==History and background==
The privacy by design framework was developed by Dr. [[Ann Cavoukian]], [[Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario]], following her joint work with the [[Dutch Data Protection Authority]] and the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Opinion/&gt;
In 2009, the [[Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario]] co-hosted an event, ''Privacy by Design: The Definitive Workshop'', with the Israeli Law, Information and Technology Authority at the 31st International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioner (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy Conference 2009 Fifth Plenary Session – Privacy by Design|url=http://www.privacyconference2009.org/program/Programa_detallado/index-iden-idweb.html#sesion5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=report2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on the State of PbD to the 33rd International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners|url=https://ipc.v51.com/wp-content/uploads/Resources/PbDReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the framework achieved international acceptance when the International Assembly of Privacy Commissioners and Data Protection Authorities unanimously passed a resolution on privacy by design&lt;ref name=foreword&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design: the definitive workshop.

== Foundational principles ==
Privacy by design is based on seven "foundational principles":&lt;ref name=7principles&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/Resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf|title=7 Foundational Principles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

The principles have been cited in over five hundred articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10949576998236199397|title=Citations for ''Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice''|publisher=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the ''Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice'' white paper by [[Ann Cavoukian]].&lt;ref name=pbdLawPolicyPracitice&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/library/repository/mon/25008/312239.pdf|title="Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice – A White Paper for Regulators, Decision-makers and Policy-makers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foundational principles in detail ===
====Proactive not reactive; preventative not remedial==== 
The privacy by design approach is characterized by proactive rather than reactive measures. It anticipates and prevents privacy invasive events before they happen. Privacy by design does not wait for privacy risks to materialize, nor does it offer remedies for resolving privacy infractions once they have occurred — it aims to prevent them from occurring. In short, privacy by design comes before-the-fact, not after.
&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/Resources/pbd-implement-7found-principles.pdf|title=The 7 Foundational Principles Implementation and Mapping of Fair Information Practices|date=January 2011|publisher=Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://ipc.v51.com/wp-content/uploads/Resources/pbd-primer.pdf|title=Privacy by Design – Primer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/pbdce/seven-foundational-principles/The-7-Foundational-Principles.pdf|title=Privacy by Design – The 7 Foundational Principles|publisher=Privacy and Big Data Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Privacy as the default====
Privacy by design seeks to deliver the maximum degree of privacy by ensuring that personal data are automatically protected in any given IT system or business practice. If an individual does nothing, their privacy still remains intact. No action is required on the part of the individual to protect their privacy — it is built into the system, by default.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Privacy embedded into design====
Privacy by design is embedded into the design and architecture of IT systems as well as business practices. It is not bolted on as an add-on, after the fact. The result is that privacy becomes an essential component of the core functionality being delivered. Privacy is integral to the system without diminishing functionality.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Full functionality – positive-sum, not zero-sum====
Privacy by design seeks to accommodate all legitimate interests and objectives in a positive-sum “win-win” manner, not through a dated, zero-sum approach, where unnecessary trade-offs are made. Privacy by design avoids the pretense of false dichotomies, such as privacy versus security, demonstrating that it is possible to have both.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====End-to-end security – full lifecycle protection====
Privacy by design, having been embedded into the system prior to the first element of information being collected, extends securely throughout the entire lifecycle of the data involved — strong security measures are essential to privacy, from start to finish. This ensures that all data are securely retained, and then securely destroyed at the end of the process, in a timely fashion. Thus, privacy by design ensures cradle-to-grave, secure lifecycle management of information, end-to-end.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Visibility and transparency – keep it open====
Privacy by design seeks to assure all stakeholders that whatever the business practice or technology involved, it is in fact, operating according to the stated promises and objectives, subject to independent verification. Its component parts and operations remain visible and transparent, to users and providers alike. Remember, trust but verify.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Respect for user privacy – keep it user-centric====
Above all, privacy by design requires architects and operators to keep the interests of the individual uppermost by offering such measures as strong privacy defaults, appropriate notice, and empowering user-friendly options. Keep it user-centric.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

==Design and standards==
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) approved the Committee on Consumer Policy (COPOLCO) proposal for a new ISO standard: ''Consumer Protection: Privacy by Design for Consumer Goods and Services'' (ISO/PC317).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO/PC 317 - Consumer protection: privacy by design for consumer goods and services|url=https://www.iso.org/committee/6935430.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard will aim to specify the design process to provide consumer goods and services that meet consumers’ domestic processing privacy needs as well as the personal privacy requirements of data protection. The standard has the UK as secretariat with thirteen participating members&lt;ref name=ISOPC317Members&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO/PC 317 - Participating Members|url=https://www.iso.org/committee/6935430.html?view=participation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and twenty observing members.&lt;ref name=ISOPC317Members/&gt;

The Standards Council of Canada (SCC) is one of the participating members, and has established a mirror Canadian committee to ISO/PC317.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCC ISO/PC 317 - Consumer protection: privacy by design for consumer goods and services|url=https://www.scc.ca/en/standards/committees/iso-pc-317-consumer-protection-privacy-design-for-consumer-goods-and-services}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The OASIS Privacy by Design Documentation for Software Engineers (PbD-SE)&lt;ref name=OASIS&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS Privacy by Design Documentation for Software Engineers (PbD-SE) TC|url=https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=pbd-ses}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technical Committee provides a specification to operationalize privacy by design in the context of software engineering. Privacy by design, like security by design, is a normal part of the software development process and a risk reduction strategy for software engineers. The PbD-SE specification translates the PbD principles to conformance requirements within software engineering tasks, and helps software development teams to produce [[artifact (software development)|artifact]]s as evidence of PbD principle adherence. Following the specification facilitates the documentation of privacy requirements from software conception to retirement, thereby providing a plan around adherence to privacy by design principles, and other guidance to privacy best practices, such as NIST’s 800-53 Appendix J (NIST SP 800-53) and the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) (PMRM-1.0).&lt;ref name=OASIS/&gt;

==Relationship to privacy-enhancing technologies == 
Privacy by design originated from [[privacy-enhancing technologies]] (PETs) in a joint 1995 report by Ann Cavoukian and John Borking.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"/&gt; In 2007 the [[European Commission]] provided a memo on PETs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs)|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-07-159_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the British Information Commissioner's Office commissioned a report titled ''Privacy by Design – An Overview of Privacy Enhancing Technologies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design – An Overview of Privacy Enhancing Technologies|url=http://www.dsp.utoronto.ca/projects/surveillance/docs/pbd_pets_paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many facets to privacy by design, including software and systems engineering as well as administrative elements (e.g. legal, policy, procedural), other organizational controls and operating contexts. Privacy by design evolved from early efforts to express fair information practice principles directly into the design and operation of information and communications technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|title=Privacy by Design : Origins, Meaning, and Prospects for Assuring Privacy and Trust in the Information Era)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289769458_Privacy_by_Design_Origins_meaning_and_prospects_for_assuring_privacy_and_trust_in_the_information_era}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his publication ''Privacy by Design: Delivering the Promises''&lt;ref name="deliveringthepromises"/&gt; [[Peter Hustinx]] acknowledges the key role played by [[Ann Cavoukian]] and [[John Borking]], then Deputy Privacy Commissioners, in the joint 1995 publication ''Privacy-Enhancing Technologies: The Path to Anonymity''.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"/&gt; This 1995 report focussed on exploring technologies that permit transactions to be conducted anonymously.

Privacy-enhancing technologies allow online users to protect the privacy of their personally identifiable information (PII) provided to (and handled by) services or applications. Privacy by design evolved to consider the broader systems and processes in which PETs were embedded and operated. The U.S. Center for Democracy &amp; Technology (CDT) in ''The Role of Privacy by Design in Protecting Consumer Privacy''&lt;ref name=RoleProtectingConsumers&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of Privacy by Design in Protecting Consumer Privacy|url=https://cdt.org/insight/the-role-of-privacy-by-design-in-protecting-consumer-privacy-1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes PET from privacy by design noting that “PETs are most useful for users who already understand online privacy risks. They are essential user empowerment tools, but they form only a single piece of a broader framework that should be considered when discussing how technology can be used in the service of protecting privacy.”&lt;ref name=RoleProtectingConsumers/&gt;

== Criticism and recommendations==
The privacy by design framework attracted academic debate, particularly following the 2010 International Data Commissioners resolution, these provide criticism of privacy by design with suggestions by legal and engineering experts to better understand how to apply the framework into various contexts.&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt;

Privacy by design has been critiqued as "vague"&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"&gt;{{cite web|last=van Rest|first=Jeroen|title=Designing Privacy by Design|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-54069-1_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leaving "many open questions about their application when engineering systems".&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering Privacy by Design|url=http://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/publications/article-1542.pdf|work=Seda Gurses, Carmela Troncoso, and Claudia Diaz}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2007, researchers at K.U. Leuven published ''Engineering Privacy by Design'' noting that “The design and implementation of privacy requirements in systems is a difficult problem and requires translation of complex social, legal and ethical concerns into systems requirements”. The authors claim that their statement regarding that the principles of privacy by design "remain vague and leave many open questions about their application when engineering systems", may be viewed as criticism. However, the purpose of the paper is to propose that "starting from data minimization is a necessary and foundational first step to engineer systems in line with the principles of privacy by design". The objective of their paper is to provide an "initial inquiry into the practice of privacy by design from an engineering perspective in order to contribute to the closing of the gap between policy makers’ and engineers’ understanding of privacy by design".&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"/&gt; 

It has also been pointed out that privacy by design is similar to [[voluntary compliance]] schemes in industries impacting the environment, and thus lacks the teeth necessary to be effective, and may differ per company. In addition, the evolutionary approach currently taken to the development of the concept will come at the cost of privacy infringements because evolution implies also letting unfit phenotypes (privacy-invading products) live until they are proven unfit.&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt; Some critics have pointed out that certain business models are built around customer surveillance and data manipulation and therefore voluntary compliance is unlikely.&lt;ref name=Counterfactual&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design: A Counterfactual Analysis of Google and Facebook Privacy Incidents|ssrn=2128146|work=Ira Rubinstein and Nathan Good}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Danish National It and Telecom Agency published as discussion paper on "New Digital Security Models" the publication references "Privacy by Design" as a key goal in creating a security model that is compliant with "Privacy by Design". This is done by extending the concept to "Security by Design" with an objective of balancing anonymity and surveillance by eliminating identification as much as possible.&lt;ref name="New Digital Security Models"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Digital Security Models|url=https://www.digitaliser.dk/resource/896495/artefact/NewDigitalSecurityModels.pdf?artefact=true&amp;PID=1792137|work=Danish National It and Telecom Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013, Rubenstein and Good used [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] privacy incidents to conduct a counterfactual analysis in order to identify lessons learned of value for regulators when recommending privacy by design. The first was that “more detailed principles and specific examples” would be more helpful to companies. The second is that “usability is just as important as engineering principles and practices”. The third is that there needs to be more work on “refining and elaborating on design principles–both in privacy engineering and usability design”. including efforts to define international privacy standards. The final lesson learned is that “regulators must do more than merely recommend the adoption and implementation of privacy by design”.&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt;

Another criticism is that current definitions of privacy by design do not address the methodological aspect of systems engineering, such as using decent system engineering methods, e.g. those which cover the complete system and data life cycle. The concept also does not focus on the role of the actual data holder but on that of the system designer. This role is not known in privacy law, so the concept of privacy by design is not based in law. This, in turn, undermines the trust by data subjects, data holders and policy-makers.&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt;

The advent of [[GDPR]] with its maximum fine of 4% of global turnover now provides a balance between business benefit and turnover, and addresses the [[voluntary compliance]] criticism and requirement from Rubenstein and Good that “regulators must do more than merely recommend the adoption and implementation of privacy by design”.&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt; Rubenstein and Good also highlighted that privacy by design could result in applications that exemplified Privacy by Design and their work was well received.&lt;ref name=CorporateHotness&gt;{{cite web|title=Why 'Privacy By Design' Is The New Corporate Hotness|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/07/28/why-privacy-by-design-is-the-new-corporate-hotness|work=Kashmir Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt;

The May 2018 [[European Data Protection Supervisor]] [[Giovanni Buttarelli]]'s paper ''Preliminary Opinion on Privacy by Design'' states, "While privacy by design has made significant progress in legal, technological and conceptual development, it is still far from unfolding its full potential for the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals. The following sections of this opinion provide an overview of relevant developments and recommend further efforts".&lt;ref name=Opinion&gt;{{cite web|title=Preliminary Opinion on privacy by design|url=https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/18-05-31_preliminary_opinion_on_privacy_by_design_en_0.pdf|work=Giovanni Buttarelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The executive summary makes the following recommendations to EU institutions:
* To ensure strong privacy protection, including privacy by design, in the ePrivacy Regulation.
* To support privacy in all legal frameworks which influence the design of technology, increasing incentives and substantiating obligations, including appropriate liability rules,
* To foster the roll-out and adoption of privacy by design approaches and PETs in the EU and at the member states’ level through appropriate implementing measures and policy initiatives,
* To ensure competence and resources for research and analysis on privacy engineering and privacy enhancing technologies at EU level, by ENISA or other entities,
* To support the development of new practices and business models through the research and technology development instruments of the EU,
* To support EU and national public administrations to integrate appropriate privacy by design requirements in public procurement,
* To support an inventory and observatory of the “state of the art” of privacy engineering and PETs and their advancement.

The EDPS will:
* Continue to promote privacy by design, where appropriate in cooperation with other data protection authorities in the European Data Protection Board (EDPB),
* Support coordinated and effective enforcement of Article 25 of the GDPR and related provisions,
* Provide guidance to controllers on the appropriate implementation of the principle laid down in the legal base, and
* Together with the DPAs of Austria, Ireland and Schleswig-Holstein, award privacy friendly apps in the mobile health domain.&lt;ref name=Opinion/&gt;

==Implementing privacy by design==
The [[European Data Protection Supervisor]] [[Giovanni Buttarelli]] set out the requirement to implement privacy by design in his article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design - Privacy Engineering|url=https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/18-01-25_privacy_by_design_privacy_engineering_cpdp_en_3.pdf|work=Giovanni Buttarelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union Agency for Network and Information Security]] (ENISA) provided a detailed report ''Privacy and Data Protection by Design – From Policy to Engineering'' on implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy and Data Protection by Design – from policy to engineering|url=https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design/at_download/fullReport|work=ENISA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Summer School on real-world crypto and privacy provided a tutorial on "Engineering Privacy by Design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering privacy by design|url=https://summerschool-croatia.cs.ru.nl/2017/slides/Engineering%20privacy%20by%20design.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_10_Privacy_Risks_Project OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks Project] for web applications that gives hints on how to implement privacy by design in practice. The OASIS Privacy by Design Documentation for Software Engineers (PbD-SE)&lt;ref name=OASIS/&gt; offers a privacy extension/complement to OMG’s Unified Modeling Language (UML) and serves as a complement to OASIS’ eXtensible Access Control Mark-up Language (XACML) and Privacy Management Reference Model (PMRM).

'''Iranian Russians''' are [[Russians]] living in [[Iran]] or Iranians of Russian descent. Russians populate various regions, but mostly in those regions which had been under direct Russian military occupation in the past, thus in Russia's [[sphere of influence]]. This was an indirect result of the outcome of the last [[Russo-Persian Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=swXiVZjonCQC&amp;pg=PA160 ''Russia and Iran, 1780-1828''] U of Minnesota Press, 1 mei 1980 {{ISBN|978-0816656974}} p 160&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays there are Russians located in the southern regions of the country as well (such as [[Bushehr]]), where many of them work as technicians and nuclear experts, on for example the [[Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant]].

Although the community has shrunk significantly since the [[Second World War]], the following [[Iran crisis of 1946]] and the [[Iranian Revolution]], Russians are known to be living in Iran since the time of the [[Safavids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2012/03/russian-orthodoxy-in-iran.html|title=''Russian Orthodoxy In Iran''|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Russians in Iran (Persia) have a long history dating back many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/russia-iii-travelers-in-Persia Russian travellers in Iran to 1917 - Iranicaonline]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/russia-i-relations Russia-Iran relations "RUSSIA i. Russo-Iranian Relations up to the Bolshevik Revolution"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first mass-immigration of Russians into Iran occurred in the early 20th century when hundreds of thousands of [[White émigré]]s had to flee from the [[Bolsheviks]]. Most of them landed in the north Iranian provinces of [[Gilan]] and [[Mazandaran]], but also in the northwest and northeast, in [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] and [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]], where communities of their descendants still live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vceInEkXX74C&amp;pg=PA201 |title=''The Soviet Union and the Iran: Soviet Policy in Iran from the Beginnings of the Pahlavi Dynasty Until the Soviet Invasion in 1941''|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CiTj3w2E6cC&amp;pg=PA89 |title=''The Soviet Union and Its Southern Neighbours: Iran and Afghanistan, 1917-1933''|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian community kept increasing in the northern provinces of the country, as a result of the Russian sphere of influence which was established since the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–28)|Russo-Persian War of 1826-28]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Queer Sinister Things: The Hidden History of Iran|author=Phillips, T.B.|year=2012|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9780557509294|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VdSBAgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GpPeyef-FO4C&amp;pg=PA128 |title=''Social Movements in Twentieth-century Iran: Culture, Ideology, and Mobilizing Frameworks''|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This influence ended some decades later with the [[Iran crisis of 1946|crisis of 1946]].

==Russian Orthodoxy==
[[Image:Kelissa russian qazvin.jpg|thumb|right|[[Russian Church, Qazvin|The Russian Church]] of [[Qazvin]]]]

The once numerous [[Russian Orthodox]] community in Iran has shrunken over the years. They are mostly the descendants of [[Russian émigrés]] and the permanently accredited staff of diplomatic and trade missions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/2012_03_09/67991325/ ''Russian Persia'' - The Voice of Russia] Accessed on 30 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tehran]]'s Orthodox Community traces its history to the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/2012_03_09/67991325/ ''Russian Persia'' - The Voice of Russia] Accessed on 30 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1917 revolution in Russia, there had been two embassy churches in Tehran plus a belfry at the Russian cemetery. Later, both of the churches were shut and destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/2012_03_09/67991325/ ''Russian Persia'' - The Voice of Russia] Accessed on 30 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Nicholas Church, Tehran]] was built the 1940s on donations from Russian émigrés.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/2012_03_09/67991325/ ''Russian Persia'' - The Voice of Russia] Accessed on 30 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by émigré architect and Iranian Army officer Nikolai Makarov.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/2012_03_09/67991325/ ''Russian Persia'' - The Voice of Russia] Accessed on 30 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as the crosses appeared on its cupolas, the half-finished church opened its doors to parishioners. There were several Orthodox priests in Tehran before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. In the early 1980s, all of them were expelled. It was not until the late 1990s that the St. Nicholas Church received its new head priest. Hieromonk Alexander Zarkeshev was appointed by the Moscow Patriarchate to serve in Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2012/03/russian-orthodoxy-in-iran.html|title=Russian Orthodoxy In Iran|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sandra Collins Good''' (born February 20, 1944&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Jl2EuFEou6cC&amp;pg=PA439&amp;lpg=PA439|title=Women Criminals: An Encyclopedia of People and Issues|last=Jensen|first=Vickie|date=|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2011|isbn=9780313337130|location=|pages=439|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a long-time member of the [[Charles Manson#Manson Family|Manson Family]] and a close friend of [[Lynette Fromme|Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme]]. Good's Manson Family nickname is "Blue", which was given to her by [[Charles Manson]] to represent clean air and water.&lt;ref&gt;Bravin, Jess (1997). Squeaky: The Life and Times Of Lynette Alice Fromme. St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|0-312-18762-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2017}}
She was born in [[San Diego|San Diego, California]], the daughter of a [[stockbroker]]. Her parents divorced when she was four years old. Good attended [[Point Loma High School]] and was a member of the Student Opinion Club. Good attended [[California State University Sacramento]], the [[University of Oregon]] and [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]] off and on for seven years, but never received a degree.

==Manson Family==
Good joined the [[Charles Manson|Manson Family]] in April 1968 and a few months later went off with them when they moved to a new home at [[Spahn Ranch]] in the mountains west of [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California|Chatsworth]]. She was in jail with [[Mary Brunner]] for attempting to use stolen [[credit card]]s when the [[Sharon Tate|Tate]]/[[Leno and Rosemary LaBianca|La Bianca]] murders took place, but was back at the ranch in time to get arrested during the August 16th raid.&lt;ref name=cielodrive.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Evidence: The Story Of The Manson Family And Their Victims|work=CieloDrive.com|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/family/good|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has a son named Ivan S. Pugh (born September 16, 1969).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Various men have been named as the father, most notably Joel Pugh (June 7, 1940 – December 1, 1969), who was found dead in a [[London]] hotel room under suspicious circumstances.&lt;ref name=Bugliosi241&gt;Bugliosi, Vincent. ''Helter Skelter'', 1974, pg 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a telephone interview with [[WWL (AM)]] in New Orleans soon after [[Lynette Fromme]]'s [[Ford assassination attempt in Sacramento|attempted assassination of Gerald Ford]], Good threatened that "a wave of assassins" from a group that she identified as the International Peoples Court of Retribution (see [[ATWA]]) would kill or disfigure certain business executives, whom she named, as well as members of their families.{{cn|date=March 2017}} Good accused the executives of polluting the environment. On September 10, 1975, in a subsequent interview with [[Barbara Frum]] of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] radio program ''[[As It Happens]]'', Good made similar threats against persons to avenge the killing of trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/barbara-frum-interviews-manson-familys-sandra-good|title=Barbara Frum interviews Manson Family’s Sandra Good - CBC Archives|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also did a telephone interview with Hamilton Ontario broadcaster Bob Bratina on CHML Radio.  As a result, Bratina was subpoenaed to appear at the trial of Sandra Good in Sacramento, where the air-check of the interview was introduced as prosecution evidence.

==Prison==
On December 22, 1975, Good and another Manson devotee, Susan Murphy, were
[[indictment|indicted]] for "conspiracy to send threatening letters through the mail" by a [[Grand jury#Federal grand juries|Federal Grand Jury]] in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] in connection with [[death threat]]s against more than 170 corporate executives who Good believed (see [[ATWA]]) were polluting the earth.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Dec. 23, 1975, "Sandra Good Indicted in Death Threat Conspiracy – 2 Manson Devotees Indicted", p. B 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Found guilty on March 16, 1976,&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', Mar. 17, 1976, "Two Devotees of Manson Guilty of Death Threats", p. B 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Good was sentenced on April 13 &lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', Apr. 13, 1976, "Sandra Good Given 15-Year Sentence – Susan Murphy Gets 5 Years for Conspiracy", p. A 3.&lt;/ref&gt; to 15 years in [[prison]].

==Parole==
Good was [[parole#United States|paroled]] in early December 1985, after having served 10 years. Unlike many of the Family members, Good still professed total allegiance to Manson.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', Dec. 3, 1985, "Manson Follower Sandra Good Paroled", p. SD 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A stipulation of her parole was that she could not return to California. She moved to [[Vermont]], where she lived quietly under the name Sandra Collins (or at times, "Blue Collins") until 1989, when her environmental activism made the news and her identity was made public.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

After her parole ended, Good moved to [[Hanford, California]], near [[California State Prison, Corcoran|Corcoran State Prison]], to be closer to Manson, although she was not allowed to visit him. On January 26, 1996, she and George Stimson began a pro-Manson website on which they claimed to have a real source of Manson thought. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} She also supported Manson's environmental movement, [[ATWA]] (Air Trees Water Animals). The website went offline in 2001, but is [http://accessmanson.mansonblog.com/ archived].

The '''sexual revolution''', also known as a time of '''sexual liberation''', was a [[social movement]] that challenged traditional codes of behavior related to sexuality and [[interpersonal relationship]]s throughout the [[United States]] and subsequently, the wider world, from the 1960s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name=allyn&gt;Allyn, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual liberation included increased acceptance of [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] outside of traditional [[heterosexual]], monogamous relationships (primarily [[marriage]]).&lt;ref&gt;Escoffier, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The normalization of [[Birth control|contraception]] and [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], [[public nudity]], [[pornography]], [[premarital sex]], [[homosexuality]], and alternative forms of sexuality, and the legalization of [[abortion]] all followed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Germaine Greer]] and [[The Female Eunuch]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/GR9913.aspx |title=Abc-Clio |publisher=Greenwood.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709181001/http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/GR9913.aspx |archivedate=2011-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formative factors==
[[File:Pouring-water-for-wet-tshirt.jpg|thumb|Youngsters participating in [[Wet T-shirt contest]] during [[Spring break]], USA]]

The term "sexual revolution" has been used since at least the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;The term appeared as early as 1929; the book ''Is Sex Necessary?'' by Thurber &amp; White, has a chapter titled ''The Sexual Revolution: Being a Rather Complete Survey of the Entire Sexual Scene''.&lt;br/&gt;
According to [[w:ru:Душенко, Константин Васильевич|Konstantin Dushenko]], the term was in use in Russia in 1925. {{cite web|url=http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/87856.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504082655/http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/87856.html |archivedate=2008-05-04 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some early commentators{{examples|date=September 2018}} believed the period of 1960–1980 was in fact the second such revolution in America, with the first during the [[Roaring Twenties]] after [[World War I]]. Indicators of non-traditional sexual behavior (e.g., gonorrhea incidence, births out of wedlock, and births to teenagers) began to rise dramatically in the mid to late 1950s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Francis|first=Andrew|date=2013|title=The Wages of Sin: How the Discovery of Penicillin Reshaped Modern Sexuality|url=|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=42 | issue = 1 |pages=5–13|via=|doi=10.1007/s10508-012-0018-4|pmid=23054260}}&lt;/ref&gt; It{{what|date=September 2018}} brought about profound shifts in attitudes{{whose|date=November 2018}} toward women's sexuality, homosexuality, pre-marital sexuality, and the freedom of sexual expression.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Psychologists and scientists such as [[Wilhelm Reich]] and [[Alfred Kinsey]] influenced the changes.{{cn|date=September 2018}} As well, changing mores were both stimulated by and reflected in literature and films, and by the social movements of the period, including the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], the women's movement, and the gay rights movement.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt;  The counterculture contributed to the awareness of radical cultural change that was the social matrix of the sexual revolution.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}}

The sexual revolution was initiated by those who shared a belief in the detrimental impact of sexual repression, a view that had previously been argued by [[Wilhelm Reich]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and the [[surrealism|Surrealist movement]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} 

The counterculture wanted to explore the body and mind, and free the personal self from the moral and legal sexual confines of modern America, as well as from 1940s-50s morals in general.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Slack, "Liberalism Radicalized: The Sexual Revolution, Multiculturalism, and the Rise of Identity Politics," {{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/08/liberalism-radicalized-the-sexual-revolution-multiculturalism-and-the-rise-of-identity-politics |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002014520/http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/08/liberalism-radicalized-the-sexual-revolution-multiculturalism-and-the-rise-of-identity-politics |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual revolution of the 1960s was grew from a conviction that the erotic should be celebrated as a normal part of life and not repressed by family, industrialized sexual morality, religion and the state.&lt;ref name="America Divided"&gt;{{cite book|last=Isserman|first=Maurice|title=America Divided|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-976506-5|pages=138–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the [[The Pill|birth control pill]] in 1960 gave women access to easy and reliable [[contraception]]. Another likely cause was a vast improvement in [[obstetrics]], greatly reducing the number of women who died due to childbearing, thus increasing the [[life expectancy]] of women. A third, more indirect cause was the large number of children born in the 1940s and early 1950s all over the western world—the '[[Baby Boom Generation]]'--many of whom would grow up in relatively prosperous and safe conditions, within a middle class on the rise and with better access to education and entertainment than ever before. By their demographic weight and their social and educational background they came to trigger a shift in society towards more permissive and informalized attitudes.

The discovery of penicillin led to significant reductions in [[syphilis]] mortality, which, in turn, spurred an increase in non-traditional sex during the mid to late 1950s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/did-penicillin-kickstart-sexual-revolution |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005104342/http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/did-penicillin-kickstart-sexual-revolution |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an increase in sexual encounters between unmarried adults.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Callum G.

===The Freudian school===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
[[Sigmund Freud]] of [[Vienna]] believed human behavior was motivated by unconscious [[drive theory|drives]], primarily by the [[libido]] or "Sexual Energy". Freud proposed to study how these unconscious drives were [[Psychological repression|repressed]] and found expression through other cultural outlets. He called this therapy "[[psychoanalysis]]".

While Freud's ideas were sometimes ignored or provoked resistance within Viennese society, his ideas soon entered the discussions and working methods of anthropologists, artists and writers all over Europe, and from the 1920s in the United States. His conception of a primary [[libido|sexual drive]] that would not be ultimately curbed by law, education or standards of decorum spelled a serious challenge to [[Victorian morality|Victorian prudishness]], and his theory of [[psychosexual development]] proposed a model for the development of sexual orientations and desires; children emerged from the [[Oedipus complex]], a sexual desire towards their parent of the opposite sex. The idea of children having their parents as their early sexual targets was particularly shocking to Victorian and early 20th century society.

According to Freud's theory, in the earliest stage of a child's psychosexual development, the [[oral stage]], the mother's breast became the formative source of all later [[erotic]] sensation. Much of his research remains widely contested by professionals in the field, though it has spurred critical developments in the humanities.

[[Anarchism|Anarchist]] Freud scholars [[Otto Gross]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]] (who famously coined the phrase "Sexual Revolution") developed a sociology of sex in the 1910s to 1930s in which the animal-like competitive reproductive behavior was seen as a legacy of ancestral human evolution reflecting in every social relation, as per the freudian interpretation, and hence the liberation of sexual behavior a mean to social revolution.

==The role of mass media==
===Mead's ''Coming of Age in Samoa''===
{{Main|Margaret Mead|Coming of Age in Samoa}}
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
The publication of anthropologist [[Margaret Mead]]'s ''Coming of Age in Samoa'' brought the sexual revolution to the public scene, as her thoughts concerning sexual freedom pervaded academia. Published in 1928, Mead's [[ethnography]] focused on the psychosexual development of Samoan adolescent children on the island of [[Samoa]]. She recorded that their adolescence was not in fact a time of "storm and stress" as Erikson's stages of development suggest, but that the sexual freedom experienced by the adolescents actually permitted them an easy transition from childhood to adulthood. Mead called for a change in suppression of sexuality in America, and her work directly resulted in the advancement of the sexual revolution in the 1930s.

Mead's findings were later criticized by anthropologist [[Derek Freeman]], who investigated her claims of promiscuity and conducted his own ethnography of Samoan society.

===Kinsey and Masters and Johnson===

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Alfred&amp;nbsp;C.&amp;nbsp;Kinsey]] published two surveys of modern sexual behaviour. In 1948 Alfred&amp;nbsp;C.&amp;nbsp;Kinsey and his co-workers, responding to a request by female students at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] for more information on human sexual behavior, published the book ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual behaviour in the Human Male]]''. They followed this five years later with ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual behaviour in the Human Female]]''. These books began a revolution in social awareness of, and public attention given to, human sexuality.

It is said that [[public morality]] severely restricted open discussion of sexuality as a human characteristic, and specific sexual practices, especially sexual behaviours that did not lead to procreation. Kinsey's books contained studies about controversial topics such as the frequency of homosexuality, and the sexuality of minors aged two weeks to fourteen years. Scientists working for Kinsey reported data which led to the conclusion that people are capable of sexual stimulation from birth. Furthermore, Kinsey's method of researching sexuality differs significantly from today's methods. Kinsey would watch his research subjects engage in sexual intercourse, sometimes engaging with his subjects as well. He would also encourage his research team to do the same, and encouraged them to engage in intercourse with him, too.

These books laid the groundwork for [[Masters and Johnson]]'s life work. A study called ''Human Sexual Response'' in 1966 revealed the nature and scope of the sexual practices of young Americans.

===The ''Playboy'' culture===

In 1953, Chicago resident [[Hugh Hefner]] founded [[Playboy]], a magazine which aimed to target males between the ages of 21 and 45.&lt;ref name=hefsex /&gt; The coverpage and nude centerfold in the first edition featured [[Marilyn Monroe]], then a rising [[sex symbol]].&lt;ref name=marilyn&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=rvwH7euUccIC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=marilyn%20playboy&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=playboy&amp;f=false|page = 75|author = Les Harding|title = They Knew Marilyn Monroe: Famous Persons in the Life of the Hollywood Icon|isbn = 9780786490141|date = 2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pictures were taken when Monroe was an unknown struggling actress and she received $50 for the photo shoot.

===Erotic novels===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
In the United States in the years 1959 through 1966, bans on three books with explicit erotic content were challenged and overturned. This also occurred in the United Kingdom starting with the 1959&amp;nbsp;Obscene Publications Act and reaching a peak with the LCL&amp;nbsp;court case.

Prior to this time, a patchwork of regulations (as well as local customs and vigilante actions) governed what could and could not be published. For example, the [[United States Customs Service]] banned [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by refusing to allow it to be imported into the United States. The [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' carried great weight among Catholics and amounted to an effective and instant boycott of any book appearing on it. Boston's [[Watch and Ward Society]], a largely Protestant creation inspired by [[Anthony Comstock]], made "[[banned in Boston]]" a national by-word.

In 1959 [[Grove Press]] published an unexpurgated version of ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' by [[D.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;Lawrence]]. The [[United States Postal Service|U.S.&amp;nbsp;Post Office]] confiscated copies sent through the mail. Lawyer [[Charles Rembar]] sued the New York City Postmaster, and won in New York and then on federal appeal.

[[Henry Miller]]'s 1934 novel, ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'', had explicit sexual passages and could not be published in the United States; an edition was printed by the [[Obelisk Press]] in Paris and copies were smuggled into the United States. ({{As of|2003}}, used book dealers asked $7,500 and more for copies of this edition.) In 1961 Grove Press issued a copy of the work, and dozens of booksellers were sued for selling it. The issue was ultimately settled by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S.&amp;nbsp;Supreme Court's]] 1964 decision in ''Grove Press, Inc. v. Gerstein''.

In 1963 Putnam published [[John Cleland]]'s 1750&amp;nbsp;novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]''. This was the turning point, because [[Charles Rembar]] appealed a restraining order against it all the way to the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Supreme Court and won. In ''[[Memoirs v. Massachusetts]]'', 383&amp;nbsp;U.S.&amp;nbsp;413, the court ruled that sex was "a great and mysterious motive force in human life", and that its expression in literature was protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

===Nonfiction===
Only books primarily appealing to "prurient interest" could be banned. In a famous phrase, the court said that obscenity is "utterly without redeeming social importance"—meaning that, conversely, any work with redeeming social importance was not obscene, even if it contained isolated passages that could "deprave and corrupt" some readers. This decision was especially significant, because, of the three books mentioned, ''Fanny Hill'' has by far the largest measure of content that seems to appeal to prurient interest, and the smallest measures of [[literary merit]] and "redeeming social importance". Whereas an expurgated version of ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' had actually once been published, no expurgated version of ''Fanny Hill'' had ever been. By permitting the publication of ''Fanny Hill'', the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Supreme Court set the bar for any ban so high that Rembar himself called the 1966&amp;nbsp;decision "the end of obscenity".

The court decisions that legalised the publication of ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' had an even more important effect: freed from fears of legal action, nonfiction works about sex and sexuality started to appear more often.

In 1962, [[Helen Gurley Brown]] published ''[[Sex and the Single Girl]]: The Unmarried Woman's Guide to Men, Careers, the Apartment, Diet, Fashion, Money and Men.'' The title itself would have been unthinkable a decade earlier. (In 1965 she went on to transform ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine into a life manual for young career women.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}})

In 1969 [[Terry Garrity|Joan Garrity]], identifying herself only as "J.", published ''[[The Sensuous Woman|The Way to Become the Sensuous Woman]]'', with information on exercises to improve the dexterity of one's tongue and how to have anal sex.

The same year saw the appearance of Dr.&amp;nbsp;[[David Reuben (sex author)|David Reuben's]] book ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (book)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]''. Despite the dignity of Reuben's medical credentials, this book was light-hearted in tone.

In 1970 the Boston Women's Health Collective published ''Women and Their Bodies'' (which became far better known a year later under its subsequent title ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]''). Not an erotic treatise or sex manual, the book nevertheless included frank descriptions of sexuality, and contained illustrations that could have caused legal problems just a few years earlier.

[[Alex Comfort]]'s ''[[The Joy of Sex]]: A Gourmet Guide to Love Making'' appeared in 1972. In later editions though, Comfort's libertinism was tamed as a response to [[AIDS]].

In 1975 [[Will McBride (photographer)|Will McBride's]] ''Zeig Mal!'' ([[Show Me!]]), written with psychologist Helga Fleichhauer-Hardt for children and their parents, appeared in bookstores on both sides of the Atlantic. Appreciated by many parents for its frank depiction of pre-adolescents discovering and exploring their sexuality, it scandalised others and eventually it was pulled from circulation in the United States and some other countries. It was followed in 1989 by ''Zeig Mal Mehr!'' ("Show Me More!").

These books had a number of things in common. They were factual and, in fact, educational. They were available to a mainstream readership. They were stacked high on the tables of discount bookstores, they were book club selections, and their authors were guests on late-night talk shows. People were seen reading them in public.

Earlier books such as ''What Every Girl Should Know'' ([[Margaret Sanger]], 1920) and ''A Marriage Manual'' (Hannah and Abraham Stone, 1939) had broken the silence in which many people, women in particular, had grown up in.

By the 1950s, in the United States, it had become rare for women to go into their wedding nights not knowing what to expect. But the open discussion of sex as pleasure, and descriptions of sexual practices and techniques, was revolutionary. There were practices which, perhaps, some had heard of. But many adults did not know for sure whether they were realities, or fantasies found only in pornographic books.

The Kinsey report revealed that these practices were, at the very least, surprisingly frequent. These other books asserted, in the words of a 1980&amp;nbsp;book by Dr.&amp;nbsp;Irene Kassorla, that ''Nice Girls Do — And Now You Can Too''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Television===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Television, the new mass communication device of the age, along with other media outlets such as radio and magazines, could broadcast information in a matter of seconds to millions of people, while only a few wealthy people would control what millions could watch. Some modern historians have theorized that these media outlets helped to spread new ideas, which were considered radical. The struggles, skirmishes and rhetorical confrontations happening in the course of these movements also became directly visible to ordinary people in a way they would never have been before; the sense of involvement in a social and sexual shift happening in the present could rapidly win new converts and spread discussions afield. The counterculture of the 1960s was becoming well known through radio, newspapers, TV, books, music and other media by the end of the 1960s.

===Pornographic film===
In 1969, ''[[Blue Movie]]'', directed by [[Andy Warhol]], was the first [[pornographic|adult erotic film]] depicting explicit [[sex]] to receive wide theatrical release in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="NYT-19690722"&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Movie Review - Blue Movie (1968) Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |date=July 22, 1969 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=December 29, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231190855/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |archivedate=December 31, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WS-2002-2005"&gt;{{cite web |last=Comenas |first=Gary |title=Blue Movie (1968) |url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-blue-movie.html |date=2005 |work=WarholStars.org |accessdate=December 29, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230082332/http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-blue-movie.html |archivedate=December 30, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-19690810"&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Warhol's Red Hot and 'Blue' Movie.

By the mid-1970s and through the 1980s, newly won sexual freedoms were being exploited by big businesses looking to capitalize on an increasingly permissive society, with the advent of public and hardcore [[pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bannon |first=Ann |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1560255250/ref=sib_dp_pt/104-9728303-1778302#reader-link/ |title=Sexual Revolution (9781560255253): Jeffrey Escoffier, Fred W.

==Modern revolutions==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
The [[Industrial Revolution]] during the nineteenth century and the growth of [[science]] and [[technology]], [[medicine]] and [[health care]], resulted in better [[contraceptives]] being manufactured. Advances in the manufacture and production of [[rubber]] made possible the design and production of [[condom]]s that could be used by hundreds of millions of men and women to prevent [[pregnancy]] at little cost. Advances in [[chemistry]], [[pharmacology]], and [[biology]], and human [[physiology]] led to the discovery and perfection of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|first oral contraceptives]], popularly known as "the Pill." 

All these developments took place alongside and combined with an increase in world [[literacy]] and decline in religious observance. Old values such as the biblical notion of "be fruitful and multiply" were cast aside as people continued to feel alienated from the past and adopted the lifestyles of progressive modernizing cultures.

Another contribution that helped bring about this modern revolution of sexual freedom were the writings of [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]], who took the philosophy of [[Karl Marx]] and similar philosophers.

When speaking of sexual revolution, historians&lt;ref&gt;The First Sexual Revolution: The Emergence of Male Heterosexuality in Moderm America. By Kevin White (New York: New York University Press: 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; make a distinction between the first and the second sexual revolution. In the first sexual revolution (1870–1910), to caucasians, Victorian morality lost its universal appeal. However, it did not lead to the rise of a "permissive society". Exemplary for this period is the rise and differentiation in forms of regulating sexuality.

"[[No-fault divorce|No-fault]]" unilateral [[divorce]] became legal and easier to obtain in many countries during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

The women's movement redefined sexuality, not in terms of simply pleasing men but recognizing women's sexual satisfaction and sexual desire. "[[The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm]]" by [[Anne Koedt]] illustrates an understanding of a women's sexual anatomy, arguing  against Freud's "assumptions of women as inferior appendage to man, and her consequent social and psychological role."&lt;ref name="Vaginal Orgasm"&gt;{{cite web|last=Koedt |first=Anne |title=The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |url=http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html |accessdate=16 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106211856/http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html |archivedate=6 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The women's movement was able to develop lesbian feminism, freedom from heterosexual act, and freedom from reproduction. Feminist [[Betty Friedan]] published the [[Feminine Mystique]] in 1963, concerning the many frustrations women had with their lives and with separate spheres which established a pattern of inequality.

[[File:CDFrontInsert.FreedomToLove.Pride.WDC.31May2009.jpg|thumb|1997 [[LGBT]] poster, New York City]]
The [[Gay Rights Movement]] started when the [[Stonewall Riots]] of 1969 crystallized a broad grass-roots mobilization. New gay liberationist gave political meaning to "coming out" by extending the psychological-personal process into public life. During the 1950s the most feared thing of the homosexual culture was "coming out", the homosexual culture of the 1950s did everything they could to help keep their sexuality a secret from the public and everyone else in their lives, but Alfred Kinsey's research on homosexuality alleged that 39% of the unmarried male population had had at least one homosexual experience to orgasm between adolescence and old age.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt; The "coming out" phenomenon helped mobilize people to live full-time as a homosexual, they no longer had to live in secret. They no longer had to sneak around and occasionally receive the sexual attention that they desire or force themselves into a heterosexual relationship in which they had no interest, and was full of lies. [[Brad Gooch]] wrote in the "Golden Age of Promiscuity" that the gay male community finally had reached a rich culture of "easy sex", sex without commitment, obligation or long-term relationships.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}}

==Feminism and sexual liberation==
{{npov-section|date=September 2018}}
Coinciding with [[second-wave feminism]] and the [[women's liberation movement]] initiated in the early 1960s, the sexual liberation movement was aided by feminist ideologues in their mutual struggle to challenge traditional ideas regarding [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]] and [[queer]] sexuality. Elimination of undue favorable bias towards men and objectification of women as well as support for women's right to choose her sexual partners free of outside interference or judgement were three of the main goals associated with sexual liberation from the feminist perspective. Since during the early stages of feminism, women's liberation was often equated with sexual liberation rather than associated with it. Many feminist thinkers believed that assertion of the primacy of sexuality would be a major step towards the ultimate goal of women's liberation, thus women were urged to initiate sexual advances, enjoy sex and experiment with new forms of sexuality.&lt;ref name="Ending Female Sexual Oppression"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hooks|first=Bell|title=Feminist Theory, From Margin To Centre|year=1984|publisher=South End Press classics|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-89608-613-5|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminist movements insisted and focused on the sexual liberation for women, both physical and psychological. The pursuit of sexual pleasure for women was the core ideology, which subsequently was to set the foundation for female independence. Although whether or not sexual freedom should be a feminist issue is currently a much-debated topic,&lt;ref name="Ending Female Sexual Oppression" /&gt; the feminist movement overtly defines itself as the movement for social, political, and economic equality of men and women.&lt;ref name="What is Feminism"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baumgardner and Richards|title=What Is Feminism|url=http://www.feminist.com/resources/artspeech/genwom/whatisfem.htm|accessdate=27 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406000204/http://www.feminist.com/resources/artspeech/genwom/whatisfem.htm|archivedate=6 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist movements are also involved the fight against sexism and since sexism is a highly complex notion,&lt;ref name="Sexism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cudd|first=Ann|title=Feminist Theory A Philosophical Anthology|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1-4051-1660-2|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to separate the feminist critique toward sexism from its fight against sexual oppression.

The feminist movement has helped create a social climate in which LGBT people and women are increasingly able to be open and free with their sexuality,&lt;ref name="Ending Female Sexual Oppression 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hooks|first=Bell|title=Feminist Theory, From Margin To Centre|year=1984|publisher=South End Press classics|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-89608-613-5|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enabled a spiritual liberation of sorts with regards to sex. Rather than being forced to hide their sexual desires or feelings, women and LGBT people have gained and continue to gain increased freedom in this area.  Consequently, the feminist movement to end sexual oppression has and continues to directly contribute to the sexual liberation movement.

Nevertheless, among many feminists, the view soon became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the sexual revolution of the 1960s, such as the decreasing emphasis on [[monogamy]], had been largely gained by men at women's expense.&lt;ref name="Willis 1984 121"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Willis|first=Ellen|author-link=Ellen Willis|title=Radical Feminism and Feminist Radicalism |journal=Social Text |volume=9/10: The 1960s without Apology |year=1984|page=121|jstor=466537|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[Anticlimax (book)|[Anticlimax: A Feminist Perspective on the Sexual Revolution]]'', [[Sheila Jeffreys]] asserted that the sexual revolution on men's terms contributed less to women's freedom than to their continued oppression, an assertion that has both commanded respect and attracted intense criticism.&lt;ref name="Zoftig 1982 88"&gt;{{citation | last = Zoftig | first = Sarah | contribution = Coming out | editor-last = SAMOIS | editor-link = Samois | title = Coming to power: writings and graphics on lesbian S/M: S/M, a form of eroticism based on a consenual exchange of power | page = 88 | publisher = Alyson Publications | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 1982 | isbn = 9780932870285 | edition = 2nd | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vance 1992 302"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vance | first = Carole S. | title = Pleasure and danger: exploring female sexuality | page = 302 | publisher = Pandora Press  | location = London New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780044408673 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;{{citation | last = Egerton | first = Jane | contribution = Sheila Jeffreys | editor-last = Gilbert | editor-first = Harriett | editor-link = Harriett Gilbert | title = The sexual imagination from Acker to Zola: a feminist companion | page = 133 | publisher = Jonathan Cape | location = London | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780224035354 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denfeld 1995 35"&gt;{{citation | last = Denfeld | first = Rene | author-link = Rene Denfeld | contribution = The antiphallic campaign: male bashing and sexual politics | editor-last = Denfeld | editor-first = Rene | editor-link = Rene Denfeld | title = The new Victorians: a young woman's challenge to the old feminist order | pages = 35 | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin | location = St Leonards, New South Wales | year = 1995 | isbn = 9781863737890 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[feminist sex wars]] broke out due to disagreements [[Feminist views on pornography|on pornography]], [[Feminist views on prostitution|on prostitution]], and [[Feminist views on BDSM|on BDSM]], as well as [[Feminist views on sexuality|sexuality in general]].


==Contraception==
As [[birth control]] became widely accessible, men and women began to have more choice in the matter of having children than ever before. The 1916 invention of thin, disposable [[latex]] [[condom]]s for men led to widespread affordable condoms by the 1930s; the demise of the [[Comstock laws]] in 1936 set the stage for promotion of available effective contraceptives such as the [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] and [[cervical cap]]; the 1960s introduction of the [[IUD]] and [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]] for women gave a sense of freedom from [[barrier contraception]]. The opposition of Churches (e.g.&amp;nbsp;''[[Humanae vitae]]'') led to parallel movements of [[secularization]] and exile from religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2008/0725/1216917534395.html |title=Fri, Jul 25, 2008 - 'Humanae Vitae' birth control ban set off a wave of dissent |publisher=The Irish Times |date=2008-07-07 |accessdate=2011-11-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122234704/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2008/0725/1216917534395.html |archivedate=2011-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women gained much greater access to birth control in the "girls world" decision in 1965, in the 1960s and 1970s the birth control movement advocated for the legalization of abortion and large scale education campaigns about contraception by governments.

==United Kingdom==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Influenced by and exposed to the revolution in America, the UK had a similar, though smaller experience.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the new generation growing up after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] had grown tired of the rationing and austerity of the 1940s and 1950s and the Victorian values of their elders, so the 1960s were a time of rebellion against the fashions and social [[mores]] of the previous generation.

An early inkling of changing attitudes came in 1960, when the government of the day tried unsuccessfully to prosecute [[Penguin Books]] for obscenity, for publishing the [[D. H. Lawrence]] novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'', which had been banned since the 1920s for what was considered racy content. The prosecution counsel [[Mervyn Griffith-Jones]] famously stood in front of the jury and asked, in his closing statement: "Is it a book you would wish your wife or servants to read?" When the case collapsed, the novel went on to become a bestseller, selling two&amp;nbsp;million copies.

The Pill became available free of charge on the [[National Health Service]] in the 1960s, at first restricted to married women, but in 1968 its availability was extended to all women.

In 1967, laws prohibiting abortion and male homosexuality were repealed, although the age of consent for homosexual men was set at 21, in contrast to the heterosexual age of consent of 16. This is how it stayed until 1994, when the male homosexual age of consent was lowered to 18, and then equalised at 16 in 2001. Also in 2001, lesbian sex was recognised in British law for the first time ever, with an age of consent of 16.

==Free love==
{{Main|Free love}}
Beginning in [[San Francisco]] in the mid-1960s, a new culture of "[[free love]]" emerged, with thousands of young people becoming "[[hippies]]", inspired by [[India]]n culture, who preached the power of love and the beauty of sex as part of ordinary life. This is part of a [[counterculture]] that continues to exist. By the 1970s, it was socially acceptable for colleges to permit co-ed housing.

Free love continued in different forms throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s, but its more assertive manifestations ended abruptly (or at least disappeared from public view) in the mid-1980s when the public first became aware of [[AIDS]], a deadly sexually-transmitted disease.

==Explicit sex on screen and stage==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
Swedish filmmakers like [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Vilgot Sjöman]] contributed to sexual liberation with sexually themed films that challenged conservative international standards. The 1951 film ''[[Hon dansade en sommar]]'' (''She Danced One Summer AKA One Summer of Happiness'') (directed by [[Arne Mattsson]]) starring [[Ulla Jacobsson]] and [[Folke Sundquist]] was notable in this regard for depicting explicit nudity, including nude bathing in a lake.

This film, as well as Bergman's ''[[Sommaren med Monika]]'' (''The Summer with Monika'', 1951) and ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|Tystnaden]] (The Silence'', 1963), caused an international uproar, not least in the United States, where the films were charged with violating standards of decency. Vilgot Sjöman's film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'', also created waves of international outcry, but it was very popular in the United States. Another of his films, ''[[491 (film)|491]]'', highlighted homosexuality among other things. ''[[Language of Love|Kärlekens språk]]'' (''The Language of Love'') was an informative documentary about sex and sexual techniques that featured the first real act of sex in a mainstream film, and inevitably it caused intense debate around the world.

From these films the concept (or catchphrase) of "Swedish sin" (licentiousness and seductive nudity) developed, even though Swedish society in the 1950s was still fairly conservative regarding sex, and the international concept of Swedish sexuality was and is largely exaggerated. The image of "hot love and cold people" emerged. Sexual liberalism was seen as part of the modernization process that, by breaking down traditional borders, would lead to the emancipation of natural forces and desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Carl |last1=Marklund |title=Hot Love and Cold People. Sexual Liberalism as Political Escapism in Radical Sweden |year=2009 |journal=NORDEUROPAforum |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=83–101 |url=http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/nordeuropaforum/2009-1/marklund-carl-83/XML/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217062419/http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/nordeuropaforum/2009-1/marklund-carl-83/XML/ |archivedate=2012-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These films caused debate there as well. The films eventually progressed the public's attitude toward sex, especially in Sweden and other northern European countries, which today tend to be more sexually liberal than others. In Sweden and nearby countries at the time, these films, by virtue of being made by directors who had established themselves as leading names in their generation, helped delegitimize the idea of habitually demanding that films should avoid overtly sexual subject matter. It proved hard to question the seriousness of purpose of Bergman, Sjöman and others, and in their wake a consciously permissive and questioning attitude to sex, nudity and "difficult" subject matter in film - and on TV - became the new standard framework.

Explicit sex on screen and [[frontal nudity]] of men and women on stage became acceptable in many Western countries, as the twentieth century drew towards its close. Special places of entertainment offering [[striptease]] and [[lap dancing]] proliferated, and limits to 'acceptable' dress in pop/rock music and at [[discotheque]]s and live music festivals, especially open-air festivals ever since the flower-power generation and [[Woodstock]] (1969), became very vague, both among performers and in the audiences or attendee crowd. The rich use of [[crossdressing]] and [[androgyne|androgynous]] attributes and clothes in rock and pop stage costumes and even references to this in song lyrics, to express sexual, fashion or literary themes is also notable, from the [[Velvet Underground]] (in [[Lou Reed]]'s lyrics) and the [[glam rock]] wave and onward. All of this persists in the early 21st century.

In many Western countries, nudity is used as a part of artistic or erotic performance, such as in nude [[body painting]], [[sex show]], [[striptease]], [[Neo-Burlesque]], and in adult-only public events like [[Folsom Street Fair]], [[Nudes-A-Poppin']], [[Fantasy Fest]], etc.

==Normalization of pornography==
{{Further|History of pornography|Golden Age of Porn}}
Sexual character is closely linked with developments in technology, and the somewhat more open and commercial circulation of pornography was a new phenomenon at the time of the sexual revolution. Pornography operated as a form of "cultural critique" insofar as it transgresses societal conventions. [[Manuel Castells]] claims that the online communities, which emerged (from the 1980s) around early bulletin board systems originated from the ranks of those who had been part of the counterculture movements and alternative way of life emerging out of the sexual revolution.&lt;ref name=Pronography&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garlick |first=Steve |title=A New Sexual Revolution? Critical Theory, Pornography, and the Internet |journal=Canadian Review of Sociology |date=August 2011 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=221–239 |doi=10.1111/j.1755-618X.2011.01264.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-618X.2011.01264.x/abstract |accessdate=14 December 2012 |pmid=22214041 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319215111/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-618X.2011.01264.x/abstract |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lynn Hunt]] points out that early modern "pornography" (18th century) is marked by a "preponderance of female narrators", that the women were portrayed as independent, determined, financially successful (though not always socially successful and recognized) and scornful of the new ideals of female virtue and domesticity, and not objectifications of women's bodies as many view pornography today. The sexual revolution was not unprecedented in identifying sex as a site of political potential and social culture. It was suggested during the sexual revolution that the interchangeability of bodies within pornography had radical implications for gender differences and that they could lose their meaning or at least redefine the meaning of gender roles and norms.&lt;ref name=Pronography /&gt; Porn had portrayed sexual activity honestly and bluntly in fiction, on stage and in movies. It could reinforce the crudest stereotypes of sex roles, standards of beauty, and power dynamics or educate about human desire.

In 1971 ''[[Playboy]]'' stopped airbrushing pubic hair out of its centerfold picture spreads; this new addition caused the magazine to hit its all-time peak circulation of more than seven million copies in 1972 and men started having more choices when it came to magazines.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

In 1972 ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' became a popular movie for heterosexual couples. The movie played all over America and was the first porn movie to earn a gross of a million dollars.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

The fact that [[pornography]] was less stigmatised by the end of the 1980s, and more mainstream movies depicted [[sexual intercourse]] as entertainment, was indicative of how normalised sexual revolution had become in society. Magazines depicting nudity, such as the popular ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazines, won some acceptance as mainstream journals, in which public figures felt safe expressing their fantasies.

Feminists have offered mixed responses to pornography. Some figures in the [[feminist]] movement, such as [[Andrea Dworkin]], challenged the depiction of women as objects in these pornographic or "urban men's" magazines. Other feminists such as [[Betty Dodson]] went on to found the [[pro-sex feminist]] movement in response to anti-pornography campaigns.
In India, an organization named Indians For Sexual Liberties is advocating the legalization of the porn business in India. The organization's founder, Laxman Singh, questioned the reasoning behind deeming as illegal the depiction of legal acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Sexual-freedom-parade-at-Jantar-Mantar-this-weekend/articleshow/12616275.cms |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230150423/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Sexual-freedom-parade-at-Jantar-Mantar-this-weekend/articleshow/12616275.cms |archivedate=2016-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premarital sex==
[[Premarital sex]], which had been heavily stigmatised for some time became more widely accepted during the sexual revolution. The increased availability of [[birth control]] (and the quasi-legalisation of [[abortion]] in some places) helped reduce the chance that pre-marital sex would result in unwanted children. By the mid-1970s the majority of newly married American couples had experienced sex before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;For an analysis and facts about how technological advance in contraception changed the cost/benefit analysis for engaging in premaritial sex, see Fernández-Villaverde, Greenwood, and Guner (2014) "From Shame to Game in One Hundred Years: An Economic Model of the Rise in Premarital Sex and its De-Stigmitization," ''[[Journal of the European Economic Association]]'', '''12''' (1): 25-61. The research is summerized in this video: {{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR366Gq-5Sg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026114212/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR366Gq-5Sg |archivedate=2015-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central part of the sexual revolution was the development of relationships between unmarried adults, which resulted in earlier sexual experimentation reinforced by a later age of marriage. The counterculture and the [[new left]] were the source of this later age of marriage. Americans were attending colleges and rebelling against their parents' ideals, which caused them to marry later in age, if at all. This meant that on average, Americans were becoming more sexually experienced before they entered into monogamous relationships. The increasing divorce rate and the decreasing stigma attached to divorce during this era also contributed to sexual experimentation.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt;  By 1971, more than 75% of Americans thought that premarital sex was okay, a threefold increase from the 1950s, and the number of unmarried Americans aged twenty to twenty-four more than doubled from 1960 to 1976. Americans were becoming less and less interested in getting married and settling down and less interested in monogamous relationships. In 1971, 35% of the country said they thought marriage was obsolete.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

The idea of marriage being out-of-date came from the new development of casual sex between Americans. With the development of the birth control pill and the legalization of abortion in 1973, there was little threat of unwanted children out of wedlock. Also, during this time every sexually transmitted disease was treatable; there was no incurable bacterial STDs, no AIDS.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

Swinger clubs were organizing in places ranging from the informal suburban home to disco-sized emporiums that promised a smorgasbord of sexual possibilities and free mouthwash. In New York City in 1977, Larry Levenson opened [[Plato's Retreat]] it was probably the closest that heterosexual America has ever gotten to the sexual frenzy of gay bathhouses. The retreat was eventually shut down in 1985 because of the constant hassle from public health authorities.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

==Politics of sex==
[[Politics]] in the United States has become intertwined with sexually related issues, called the "politics of sex".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} A differing view of abortion pitted [[pro-life]] activists against [[pro-choice]] activists.

Women and men who lived with each other without marriage sought "[[palimony]]" equal to the [[alimony]].{{sfn|Abidin|2007|p=}} Teenagers assumed their right to a sexual life with whomever they pleased, and bathers fought to be topless or nude at beaches.{{sfn|Abidin|2007|p=}}

==Criticism==
Fraenkel (1992) believes that the "sexual revolution", that the West supposedly experienced in the late 1960s, is indeed a misconception and that sex is not actually enjoyed freely, it is just observed in all the fields of culture; that is a kind of taboo behavior technically called "[[repressive desublimation]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Marcuse]] (1964) pp.59, 75–82&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[radical feminists]], the view soon became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the sexual revolution of the 1960s, such as the decreasing emphasis on [[monogamy]], had been largely gained by men at women's expense.&lt;ref name="Willis 1984 121"/&gt; In ''[[Anticlimax: A Feminist Perspective on the Sexual Revolution]]'', [[Sheila Jeffreys]] asserted that the sexual revolution on men's terms contributed less to women's freedom than to their continued oppression, an assertion that has both commanded respect and attracted intense criticism.&lt;ref name="Zoftig 1982 88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vance 1992 302"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Denfeld 1995 35"/&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[feminist sex wars]] broke out due to disagreements [[Feminist views on pornography|on pornography]], [[Feminist views on prostitution|on prostitution]], and [[Feminist views on BDSM|on BDSM]], as well as [[Feminist views on sexuality|sexuality in general]].

==Backlash==

Allyn argues that the sexual optimism of the 1960s waned with the economic crises of the 1970s, the massive commercialization of sex, increasing reports of child exploitation, disillusionment with the counter-culture and the New Left, and a combined left-right backlash against sexual liberation as an ideal. The discovery of herpes escalated anxieties rapidly and set the stage for the nation's panicked response to AIDS.&lt;ref name=allyn /&gt;

Although the rate of teenage sexual activity is hard to record, the prevalence of [[teenage pregnancy]] in developed nations such as Canada and the UK have seen a steady decline since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexualityandu.ca/resource-library/statistics/teen-pregnancy-rates |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930135322/http://www.sexualityandu.ca/resource-library/statistics/teen-pregnancy-rates |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8340988/Teenage-pregnancies-at-lowest-level-since-1980s.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Martin | last=Beckford | title=Teenage pregnancies at lowest level since 1980s | date=2011-02-23 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627003556/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8340988/Teenage-pregnancies-at-lowest-level-since-1980s.html | archivedate=2012-06-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1991 there were 61.8 children born per 1,000 teenage girls in the United States.

The Sharchops are an Indo-Mongoloid people who migrated from [[Assam]], or possibly [[Burma]], c. 1200 – c. 800 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Culture of Bhutan|url=http://www.everyculture.com/A-Bo/Bhutan.html|work=Countries and Their Cultures|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George van Driem|Van Driem]] (1993) indicates that Sharchops are closely related to the [[Monpa people|Mönpa]] and that both are descendants of the indigenous pre-Tibetan (pre-[[Ngalop people|Ngalop]]) peoples of Bhutan. Due to the societal prominence and political power of Dzongkha-speaking Bhutanese, however, Sharchops are marginalized (and sometimes persecuted) in Bhutan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Committee for Refugees World Refugee Survey 1999 - Bhutan|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6a8c413.html|work=United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants|accessdate=29 September 2013|date=1 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sharchops are the largest ethnic group in Bhutan.&lt;ref name=vanDriem93&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.forcedmigration.org/pdf/?pid=fmo:3003 |format=PDF |last=van Driem |first=George L. |authorlink=George van Driem |title=Language Policy in Bhutan |publisher=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]] |location=[[London]] |year=1993 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanDriem1&gt;{{cite book|first=George |last=van Driem |year=2001 |title=Languages of the Himalayas: An Ethnolinguistic Handbook of the Greater Himalayan Region |publisher=Brill |page=915 ''et seq.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
The Sharchops comprise most of the population of eastern Bhutan, a country whose total population in 2010 was approximately 708,500.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; Although they have long been the largest single ethnic group in Bhutan, the Sharchop have been largely assimilated into the culturally and politically dominant Tibetic Ngalop culture.&lt;ref name=CS-EG&gt;{{Country study|author=Robert L. Worden |country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |section=Ethnic Groups |editor=Andrea Matles Savada |date=September 1991 |pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Together, the Ngalop, Sharchop, and tribal groups constituted up to 72 percent of the population in the late 1980s, according to official Bhutanese statistics.&lt;ref name=CS-EG/&gt;&lt;ref name=CS-s&gt;{{Country study|author=Robert L. Worden |country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |section=Society |editor=Andrea Matles Savada |date=September 1991 |pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1981 census claimed that Sharchops represented 30% of the population, and Ngalops approximately 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/bhutan/backgrounders/index.html |title=Bhutan Backgrounder |work=SATP online |publisher=South Asia Terrorism Portal |date=2002-09-20 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The World Factbook]], however, estimates that the "Bhote" Ngalop and Sharchop ethnic groups together comprise approximately 50% of Bhutan's population, at 354,200 people.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{CIA_World_Factbook_link|bt|Bhutan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming Sharchops still outnumber Ngalops at a 3:2 ratio, the total population of Sharchops in Bhutan is approximately 212,500.

==Language==
Most Sharchops speak [[Tshangla language|Tshangla]], a [[Tibeto-Burman]] language; fewer speak the [[Olekha language]].&lt;ref name=SIL1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=BT |title=Languages of Bhutan |work=[[Ethnologue]] Online |publisher=[[SIL International]] |location=[[Dallas]] |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also learn the national language, [[Dzongkha]]. Because of their proximity to India, some speak [[Assamese language|Assamese]] or [[Hindi]].

Tshangla is also spoken by the [[Monpa people|Monpa (Menba)]] national minority across the border in [[China]], distributed in [[Mêdog County|Mêdog]], [[Nyingchi Prefecture|Nyingchi]] and [[Dirang]]. Tshangla is similar to the [[Kalaktang language|Kalaktang]] and [[Dirang language|Dirang]] languages spoken by the Monpa of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], India.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Blench|Blench, Roger]] (2014). Sorting out Monpa: The relationships of the Monpa languages of Arunachal Pradesh.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifestyle==
Sharchop peoples practice slash-and-burn and ''tsheri'' agriculture, planting dry rice crops for three or four years until the soil is exhausted and then moving on,&lt;ref name=CS-EG/&gt; however the practice has been officially banned in Bhutan since 1969.&lt;ref name=CS-F&gt;{{Country study|author=Robert L.

Most of the Sharchops follow [[matrilineal]] lines in the inheritance of land and livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fact Sheet Bhutan. Women in Agriculture, Environment and Rural Production |url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/Gender/BHU.PDF |publisher=[[FAO]] |work=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations online |accessdate=8 Sep 2017 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Most Sharchops follow [[Tibetan Buddhism]] with some elements of [[Bön]], although those who live in the [[Duars]] follow [[Animism]].&lt;ref name=CS-EG/&gt;

{{Dynamic list}}
{{Judaism}}
&lt;!--it lists things that HAPPEN to be certain numbers, rather than just numbers that are specifically significant in their own right. For example, the date of something is NOT significant as a number. This article is NOT called "list of all numbers used in any way in Judaism". There ARE significant numbers like 7, 12, and 40, but it is only SOME cases of these that are significant AS NUMBERS. Don't wreck the article by filling it with all possible things that happen to involve such numbers, nor by filling it with all possible numbers. A good source for a decent article would be [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Encyclopaedia_Biblica/Networks-Number#NUMBER], which is public domain --&gt;
Numbers play an important role in Judaic ritual practices and are believed to be a means for understanding the divine. A [[Mishnaic]] textual source, [[Pirkei Avot]] 3:23, makes clear that the use of [[gematria]] is dated to at least the [[Tannaic]] period. This marriage between the symbolic and the physical found its pinnacle in the creation of the [[Tabernacle]]. The Hebrew word for symbol is ''ot'', which, in early Judaism, denoted not only a sign, but also a visible religious token of the relation between God and man. It is largely held by [[Jewish leadership]] that the numerical dimensions of the temple are a "microcosm of creation ... that God used to create the [[Four worlds|Olamot-Universes]]."&lt;ref name="Kaplan-90"&gt;[[#KAPLAN_1990|Kaplan 1990]]: p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

==36==
*The ''Tzadikim Nistarim'' ({{lang-he-n|צַדִיקִים נִסתָּרים}}, hidden righteous ones) or ''Lamed Vav Tzadikim'' ({{lang-he-n|ל"ו צַדִיקִים}}, 36 righteous ones), often abbreviated to ''Lamed Vav(niks)''{{ref label|Note1|a|a}}, refers to ''36 Righteous people'', a notion rooted within the more [[Kabbalah|mystical]] dimensions of [[Judaism]]. The singular form is ''Tzadik Nistar'' ({{lang-he-n|צַדִיק נִסתָר}}). The source is the [[Talmud]] itself, explained as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;As a mystical concept, the number 36 is even more intriguing. It is said that at all times there are 36 special people in the world, and that were it not for them, all of them, if even one of them was missing, the world would come to an end. The two [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] for 36 are the ''[[Lamedh|lamed]]'', which is 30, and the ''[[Waw (letter)|vav]]'', which is 6. Therefore, these 36 are referred to as the ''Lamed-Vav Tzadikim''. This widely held belief, this most unusual Jewish concept is based on a [[Talmudic]] statement to the effect that in every generation 36 righteous "greet the [[Shekhinah|Shechinah]]," the Divine Presence (Tractate Sanhedrin 97b; Tractate Sukkah 45b).&lt;ref name="Zwerin_YKKN02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanet.com/Sinai/resources/sermons/Zwerin_YKKN02.html|title=THE 36 - WHO ARE THEY?|last=Zwerin|first=Rabbi Raymond A.|date=September 15, 2002 / 5763|publisher=americanet.com|accessdate=3 August 2010|location=Temple Sinai, Denver|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030118221508/http://americanet.com/Sinai/resources/sermons/Zwerin_YKKN02.html|archivedate=Jan 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ''Lamed-Vav Tzaddikim'' are also called the ''Nistarim'' ("concealed ones"). In our folk tales, they emerge from their self-imposed concealment and, by the mystic powers which they possess, they succeed in averting the threatened disasters of a people persecuted by the enemies that surround them. They return to their anonymity as soon as their task is accomplished, 'concealing' themselves once again in a Jewish community wherein they are relatively unknown. The ''lamed-vavniks'', scattered as they are throughout the [[Diaspora]], have no acquaintance with one another. On very rare occasions, one of them is 'discovered' by accident, in which case the secret of their identity must not be disclosed. The lamed-vavniks do not themselves know that they are one of the 36. In fact, tradition has it that should a person claim to be one of the 36, that is proof positive that they are certainly not one. Since the 36 are each exemplars of ''anavah'', ("humility"), having such a virtue would preclude against one’s self-proclamation of being among the special righteous. The 36 are simply too humble to believe that they are one of the 36.&lt;ref name="Zwerin_YKKN02"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*The term ''lamedvavnik'' is derived from the Hebrew letters ''Lamed'' (L) and ''Vav'' (V), whose numerical value adds up to 36. The "nik" at the end is a [[Russian language|Russian]] or Yiddish suffix indicating "a person who..." (As in "[[Beatnik]]"; in English, this would be something like calling them "The Thirty-Six'''ers'''".) The number 36 is twice 18. In [[gematria]] (a form of Jewish [[numerology]]), the number 18 stands for "life", because the Hebrew letters that spell [[chai (symbol)|''chai'']], meaning "living", add up to 18. Because 36 = 2×18, it represents "two lives".

A '''temazcal''' ({{IPA-es|temasˈkal|}}) is a type of [[sweat lodge]] which originated with [[pre-Hispanic]] Indigenous peoples in [[Mesoamerica]]. The word temazcal comes from the [[Nahuatl]] word {{lang|nci|temāzcalli}} {{IPA-nah|temaːsˈkalːi|}} ("house of heat"){{Citation needed|reason=contradicts other citation|date=May 2011}}, or possibly from the Nahua words {{lang|nci|teme}} (to bathe) and {{lang|nci|calli}} (house).&lt;ref&gt;Aaland, Mikkel. "Origin of the Temescal". {{cite web |url=http://www.cyberbohemia.com/Pages/originoftem.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708215231/http://www.cyberbohemia.com/Pages/originoftem.htm |archivedate=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Temazcal in [[English language|English]] is also written as temezcal, temascal, or temescal.

In ancient Mesoamerica it was used as part of a curative ceremony thought to purify the body after exertion such as after a battle or a ceremonial ball game. It was also used for healing the sick, improving health, and for women to give birth. It continues to be used today in Indigenous cultures of [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]] that were part of the ancient [[Mesoamerican region]] for spiritual and health reasons. It is currently being recovered by all sectors of society in Mexico and Central America and is used as a cleansing of mind, body and spirit. 

The temazcal is usually a permanent structure, unlike sweat lodges in other regions. It is usually constructed from [[volcanic]] rock and [[cement]] and is usually a circular dome, although rectangular ones have been found at certain [[archeological]] sites and this shape is also used. To produce the heat, volcanic stones are heated. Volcanic stones are safe because they do not explode from the temperature. They are then placed in a pit located in the center or near a wall of the temazcal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14364">'''The Interpersonal Gap''' is a model of communication developed by John L. Wallen (March 24, 1918 — July 31, 2001), an educator and a pioneer in the fields of emotional intelligence and interpersonal communication. As Chinmaya &amp; Vargo state in their 1979 paper on Wallen “Many people who conduct interpersonal relations laboratories have been influenced by the ideas of John Wallen, a social psychologist from Portland, Oregon. He has written a number of papers which identify the sources of difficulty in communication. In these writings, Wallen focuses on the process of communication, not the underlying motives, drives, traits, attitudes, or personality characteristics of the individual. Wallen's ideas are easily understandable to laymen and professional alike.”&lt;ref&gt;Chinmaya, A. &amp; Vargo, J.W. (1979). Improving Communication: The Ideas of John Wallen. John Abbott College and the University of Alberta.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from Harvard College in 1940, he earned advance degrees in psychology at Ohio State University, Harvard University and the University of Oregon. Dr. Wallen taught at the University of Maryland and Black Mountain College in North Carolina before moving to Oregon in 1948. In Oregon, he had been director of research at the Boys and Girls Society of Oregon, associate professor at Portland State College, director of the Human Relations and Development Group at Tektronix, and staff member of the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory. He had also been president of the Oregon Psychological Association and fellow of the [[National Training Laboratories]] (NTL) Institute for Applied Behavioral Science in Washington, D.C. It was during his time in Oregon that he developed ''The Interpersonal Gap.''

According to Chinmaya &amp; Vargo, “Wallen…integrated the work of many scholars including Allport (1949), Hayakawa (1964), Heider (1958), Korzybski (1958), [[Lewin]] (1926, 1948, 1951), and Rank (1941, 1968) into a systematic theory of communication.”&lt;ref&gt;Chinmaya, A. &amp; Vargo, J.W. (1979). Improving Communication: The Ideas of John Wallen. John Abbott College and the University of Alberta.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, Wallen’s only known published work was the co-authored book, "Counseling with Returned Servicemen," with [[Carl Rogers]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, C. &amp;  Wallen, J.L. (1946) Counseling with Returned Servicemen. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; He authored numerous unpublished papers, including ''"The Interpersonal Gap"'' in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Wallen, J.L. (1967). The Interpersonal Gap. Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallen primarily taught his theories in academic settings (he was training educators). He did so prior to the age of computers. At the time he was of the opinion that "if his ideas are useful, they will spread through personalized channels of communication.”&lt;ref&gt;Chinmaya, A. &amp; Vargo, J.W. (1979). Improving Communication: The Ideas of John Wallen. John Abbott College and the University of Alberta.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, he wanted educators to feel free to mimeograph his work and distribute copies. With this in mind, he avoided publishing or copyrighting his work. While this unorthodox approach allowed educators to freely distribute his mimeographed works, it also hampered the spread of his theories outside of the circle of his immediate colleagues in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.

Beginning in the Pacific Northwest, but spreading elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;(Authors not cited) (1977). Leadership: A Process-Not a Position. Washington, DC: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory/National Education Association/National Association of School Counselors.&lt;/ref&gt;
Wallen’s theories were applied extensively to training teachers and faculty in school systems through the publications of the Portland-based Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory. NWREL was directed at the time by Charles Jung. Jung was a student of Ronald Lippitt’s, who in turn was student of [[Kurt Lewin]], the creator of the [[T-group (social psychology)|T-group]] and regarded by many as the father of [[Social Psychology]] and  [[Organization Development]]. Lewin was a major influence on Wallen. Wallen's work was also spread through the extensive publications of another Lippitt student, Richard Schmuck, of the Center for the Advanced Study of Educational Administration at the University of Oregon.

''The Interpersonal Gap'' also became a core theory in the [[T-group (social psychology)|T-group]] and [[Organization Development]] methods of Robert P. Crosby, who worked closely with Dr. Wallen from 1968 to 1975. The two co-led several [[National Training Laboratories]] T-groups during that time. When Mr. Crosby founded the Leadership Institute of Seattle (LIOS) Applied Behavioral Science Graduate Program he made Wallen’s material a core requirement of the curriculum,&lt;ref&gt;Wallen, J.L. The Interpersonal Gap: LIOS Models - Readings in Communication Skills. Seattle, WA: The Leadership Institute of Seattle.&lt;/ref&gt; and he did the same when founding and leading the ALCOA Corporate leadership program from 1990 to 2005. During Mr. Crosby’s Organization Development career he used the ''Interpersonal Gap'' model in numerous culture change and performance improvement initiatives, most famously during the PECO Nuclear turnaround following the shutdown [[Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station]] for human performance issues by the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, G. (2015). Fight, Flight, Freeze: Taming Your Reptilian Brain and other Practical Approaches to Self-Improvement. Second Edition. Seattle, WA: CrosbyOD Publishing. Chapters 3 and 4 are dedicated to The Interpersonal Gap and Wallen’s behavioral skills, Chapter 11 to the PECO Nuclear turnaround.&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby and his associates lead Wallen based [[T-groups]], known as "Tough Stuff [[Emotional Intelligence]] in the Workplace" workshops, to this day: http://www.crosbyod.com/events/.

Chinmaya &amp; Vargo conclude their paper thusly: “One of the leaders in the study of the nature and process of communication is John Wallen. John Wallen's ideas have influenced a number of human relations practitioners. The communication skills are especially valuable in that they are easily demonstrated and readily learned by almost anyone. The effects of using the skills are quickly apparent. For these reasons, the concepts presented here can be of great value to teachers, counsellors, parents, spouses, and friends.”&lt;ref&gt;Chinmaya, A. &amp; Vargo, J.W. (1979). Improving Communication: The Ideas of John Wallen. John Abbott College and the University of Alberta.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Theory==

''The Interpersonal Gap'' highlights several core Emotional Intelligence (EQ) skills. For example, Wallen emphasized the role of the receiver when communicating rather than just the sender, counter to most models of communication. As part of the model Wallen identified four key skills (Behavioral Specifics, Feeling Description, Perception Check and Paraphrase)&lt;ref&gt;Wallen, J.L. (Undated material). Summary of Basic Communication Skills for Improving Interview Performance and Interpersonal Relationships. Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; that became the cornerstone of the [[T-group (social psychology)|T-group]] based experiential training developed by Wallen colleague Robert P. Crosby.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, R.P. (1992). Walking the Empowerment Tightrope: Balancing Management Authority &amp; Employee Influence. King of Prussia, PA: Organization Design and Development, Inc. The Interpersonal Gap is included as Appendix O.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to Wallen’s ''Interpersonal Gap'' paper,&lt;ref&gt;Wallen, J.L. (1967). The Interpersonal Gap. Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; “The most basic and recurring problems in social life stem from what you intend and the actual effect of your actions on others.” As described in the self-improvement book Fight, Flight, Freeze, “Wallen’s theory is that each of us has intentions in every interaction (we intend a certain impact), we translate (or encode) our intentions into words and actions, the people we are interacting with translate (decode) our words and actions, and the decoding determines the initial emotional impact on them,”&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, G. (2015). Fight, Flight, Freeze: Taming Your Reptilian Brain and other Practical Approaches to Self-Improvement. Second Edition. Seattle, WA: CrosbyOD Publishing. Chapters 3 and 4 are dedicated to The Interpersonal Gap and Wallen’s behavioral skills, Chapter 11 to the PECO Nuclear turnaround.&lt;/ref&gt; as illustrated in the following graph: [[File:Interpersonal Gap Large.png|thumb|The Interpersonal Gap by John L. Wallen]]

*Note: Dr. Wallen did not use the word “filter” (rather he spoke of each person’s unique method of encoding and decoding) nor did he use the behaviors outlined in [[Albert Mehrabian]]’s famous study (words, tone of voice, body language). Both additions come from the work of Robert P. Crosby and his associates. This graphic is reprinted from Fight, Flight, Freeze with the author’s permission.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, G. (2015). Fight, Flight, Freeze: Taming Your Reptilian Brain and other Practical Approaches to Self-Improvement. Second Edition. Seattle, WA: CrosbyOD Publishing. Chapters 3 and 4 are dedicated to The Interpersonal Gap and Wallen’s behavioral skills.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wallen’s model there is ample potential for misunderstanding at any step in the process, beginning with understanding yourself - that is, with having clarity about what impact you really want in any given interaction. Such misunderstandings are what Wallen refers to as a “gap.” As he puts it, “Interpersonal gap refers to the degree of congruence between one person’s intentions and the effect produced in the other. If the effect is what is intended, the gap has been bridged. If the effect is the opposite of what was intended, the gap has become greater.”&lt;ref&gt;Wallen, J.L. (1967). The Interpersonal Gap. Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallen goes on to say, “We see our own actions in the light of our own intentions, but we see the other’s actions not in the light of the other person’s intentions but in the effect on us.”&lt;ref&gt;Wallen, J.L. (1967). The Interpersonal Gap. Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ''The Interpersonal Gap'' indicates that we each know ourselves by our own intentions (for example, when we have been misunderstood, we know what we meant). We know others by our interpretations. Wallen’s perspective contrasts with the dominant cultural paradigm that says “I know you by your actions.” If that were true, then the problem is "your actions" (i.e., the other person must change). ''The Interpersonal Gap'' in contrast points inward: if my interpretation is potentially the problem (i.e., I may have taken the other’s action differently than intended) if I change my interpretation or at least consider other possible intentions behind the same actions, I change my own reaction. To learn what the other person intended Wallen advocates using specific behavioral skills&lt;ref&gt;Wallen, J.L. (Undated material). Summary of Basic Communication Skills for Improving Interview Performance and Interpersonal Relationships. Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; combined with a ''genuine'' intent of understanding the other(the importance of being genuine in one's intention to close gaps is one reflection of the influence of [[Carl Rogers]] on Wallen's work).&lt;ref&gt;Wallen, J.L. (1967). The Interpersonal Gap. Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sum, Wallen’s model postulates that we create our own reactions/emotional responses through our interpretations of others. He held that misunderstandings were the cause of most conflict, and that such conflict can be prevented or resolved through understanding the process of communication, and through situational application of specific skills.

'''Wallen identified four behavioral skills with which to close interpersonal gaps. G. Crosby described them this way:&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, G. (2015). Fight, Flight, Freeze: Taming Your Reptilian Brain and other Practical Approaches to Self-Improvement. Second Edition. Seattle, WA: CrosbyOD Publishing. Chapters 3 and 4 are dedicated to The Interpersonal Gap and Wallen’s behavioral skills.&lt;/ref&gt;'''

{{Forms of government}}

A '''timocracy''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] τιμή ''timē'', "price, worth" and -κρατία ''-kratia'', "rule")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=timocracy|title="Timocracy" etymology |accessdate=2008-10-25|last=Harper |first=Douglas |work= |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Aristotle's ''Politics'' is a [[State (polity)|state]] where only property owners may participate in [[government]].  The more extreme forms of timocracy, where power derives entirely from wealth with no regard for social or civic responsibility, may shift in their form and become a [[plutocracy]] where the wealthy and powerful use their power to increase their wealth.

==Timocracy and property==
[[Solon]] introduced the ideas of ''timokratia'' as a graded [[oligarchy]] in his [[Solonian Constitution]] for [[Athens]] in the early 6th century BC.  His was the first known deliberately implemented form of timocracy, allocating political rights and economic responsibility depending on membership of one of four [[social class|tier]]s of the population.  Solon defined these tiers by measuring how many [[bushel]]s of produce each man could produce in a year, namely:

*'''[[Pentacosiomedimni]]''' &amp;ndash; "Men of the 500 bushel", those who produced 500 bushels of produce per year, could serve as generals in the army
*'''[[Hippeis]]''' &amp;ndash; Knights, those who could equip themselves and one cavalry horse for war, valued at 300 bushels per year
*'''[[Zeugitae]]''' &amp;ndash; Tillers, owners of at least one pair of [[pack animal|beasts of burden]], valued at 200 bushels per year, could serve as [[Hoplites]]
*'''[[Thetes]]''' &amp;ndash; Manual laborers

[[Nicholas G. L. Hammond|N. G. L. Hammond]] supposes Solon instituted a [[graduated tax]] upon the upper classes, levied in a ratio of 6:3:1, with the lowest class of thetes paying nothing in taxes but remaining ineligible for elected office.

[[Aristotle]] later wrote in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' ([http://virtuescience.com/ethics8.html#8.10 Book 8, Chapter 10]) about three "true political forms" for a state, each of which could appear in corrupt form, becoming one of three negative forms.  Aristotle describes timocracy in the sense of rule by property-owners: it comprised one of his true political forms.  Aristotelian timocracy approximated to the constitution of [[Athens]], although Athens exemplified the corrupted version of this form, described as [[democracy]].

==Timocracy, comparable values, and Plato's five regimes==
{{Main|Plato's five regimes}}
In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato describes five regimes (of which four are unjust). Timocracy is listed as the first "unjust" regime.  Aristocracy degenerates into timocracy when, due to miscalculation on the part of its governed class, the next generation of guardians and auxiliaries includes persons of an inferior nature (the persons with souls made of iron or bronze, as opposed to the ideal guardians and auxiliaries, who have souls made of gold and silver). A timocracy, in choosing its leaders, is "inclining rather to the more high-spirited and simple-minded type, who are better suited for war".&lt;ref&gt;Rep. 8.547e; Cahn, Steven M., ''Classics of Political and Moral Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0199791155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[city-state]] of [[Sparta]] provided Plato with a real-world model for this form of government. Modern observers might describe Sparta as a [[totalitarian]] or [[one-party state]], although the details we know of its society come almost exclusively from Sparta's enemies. The idea of [[militarism]]-[[stratocracy]] accurately reflects the fundamental values of Spartan society.

The '''Tsimihety''' are a [[ethnic groups of Madagascar|Malagasy ethnic group]] who are found in the  north-central region of [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref name=brittsim&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tsimihety Tsimihety], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; Their name means "those who never cut their hair", a behavior likely linked to their independence from [[Sakalava people|Sakalava]] kingdom, located to their west, where cutting hair at the time of mourning was expected.{{sfn|Fox|1990|pp=65-66}}{{sfn|Lambek|2015|pp=60-61}}{{sfn|Bradt|2007|p=29}} They are found in mountainous part of the island.&lt;ref name=brittsim/&gt; They are one of the largest Malagasy ethnic groups and their population estimates range between 700,000 and over 1.2 million.{{sfn|Appiah|Gates Jr.|2005|pp=230-231}}{{sfn|Diagram Group|2013}} This estimation places them as the fourth-largest ethnicity in [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populstat.info/Africa/malegasg.htm |title=MADAGASCAR: general data |publisher=Populstat.info |accessdate=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic identity==
The Tsimihety trace their origins back to the eastern coast, having migrated with their cattle to the Mandritsara plain in the 18th century as leaderless refugees fleeing the slave wars ongoing in their homeland.  Soon afterward they accepted the rule of the Volafotsy, a clan associated with the Maroserana who had migrated north from Sakalava territory.{{sfn|Ogot|1999|p=428}}  Peter Wilson – a professor of Anthropology specializing on Madagascar, states that Tsimihety people do not fit the normal assumptions of anthropologists, for these people "didn't create symbols or rituals or tribal rules" like tribes do, but they can "only be described negatively" by what they didn't and don't do.{{sfn|Wilson|1992|pp=1-5}}{{sfn|Lambek|2015|pp=60-61}} They are thus not a tribe, because they lack tribal ties, lack social compact and have no hierarchical power structure within the ethnic group. Their relationships are centered around biological family and kin.{{sfn|Perry|2007|pp=74-75}}

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F013783-0033, Berlin, Staatsbesuch aus Madagaskar-2.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Philibert Tsiranana]], from the Tsimihety ethnic group, was the first president of post-colonial era Madagascar.]]
The [[anarchist system]] prevailed among the Tsimihety people before the 19th century. However, in 1823, [[Radama I]], the [[Merina people|Merina]] king, brought the entire island under one rule, including the Tsimihety, and abolished slavery.{{sfn|Skutsch|2013|p=768–769}}

The French colonial rule absorbed the Tsimihety in 1896, as a part of [[French Madagascar]].{{sfn|Skutsch|2013|p=768–769}} The Tsimihety have been an active part of Madagascar politics ever since. [[Philibert Tsiranana]], a Tsimihety from near [[Mandritsara]], was the first president of the [[Malagasy Republic]], when it became a semi-autonomous region within the French Union in 1959, and remained president for 10 years after it gained independence from France in 1960.{{sfn|Appiah|Gates Jr.|2005|pp=230-231}}

==Society==
[[David Graeber]], an [[anthropologist]] specializing in the study of [[Anarchy]] systems, states the Tsimihety people exemplify one of the few historic social systems that accepted no authority and practiced anarchy:

{{Quote|
They [Tsimihety] are marked by resolutely egalitarian social organization and practices. They are, in other words, the anarchists of northwest Madagascar. To this day they have maintained a reputation as masters of evasion: under the French, administrators would complain that they could send delegations to arrange for labor to build a road near a Tsimihety village, negotiate the terms with apparently cooperative elders, and return with the equipment a week later only to discover the village entirely abandoned – every single inhabitant had moved in with some relative in another part of the country. |David Graeber |''Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology''{{sfn|Graeber|2004|p=}}}}

The Tsimihety represent one of the rare examples where the culture was innately anti-government, where states Graeber, all forms of government had effectively been withdrawn even from countryside and communities. Informal consensus was the basis of local decisions, anyone behaving like a leader was considered suspicious, giving orders was wrong, expecting anyone to be responsible for or would actually do something was wrong, and even concepts such as working for a wage was morally shunned. Graeber states that ultimately, the Tsimihety were "eventually gobbled up by the state", gave up the utopia, as they sought economic opportunities and infrastructure.{{sfn|Graeber|2004|p=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Vayda | first=Andrew P. | title=Actions, Variations, And Change | journal=Canberra Anthropology | volume=13 | issue=2 | year=1990 | pages=29–45 | doi=10.1080/03149099009508481 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family affiliation===
The Tsimihety people are patrilineal, and kin relationships with the male ancestors and descendants are most important to both men and women.{{sfn|Perry|2007|pp=74-75}} Their cultural conventions require extended exogamy, which coupled with high birth rates have led to their migration and high diffusion among neighboring ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=brittsim/&gt; The society is also notable for the social roles expected by a Tsimihety family from a maternal uncle.{{sfn|Bradt|2007|p=29}}
&lt;!--===Class affiliation===
===Religious affiliation===
==Culture==
===Fady===
===Funeral rites===
===Dance and music===--&gt;

==Language==
The language of the Tsimihety people is a dialect of the [[Malagasy language]],&lt;ref name=brittsim/&gt; a branch of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language group]] derived from the [[Barito languages]] spoken in the [[Austronesia]]n region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/xmw Malagasy, Tsimihety], Ethnologue&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dm Albro (2005), [http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/tsim1257 Language: Tsimihety Malagasy], Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Tsimihety society and economy, as in much of [[Madagascar]], is primarily focused on agriculture. Rice is the staple crop, and the Tsimihety raise cattle.&lt;ref name=brittsim/&gt; Working on crop land on Tuesday is [[Fady (taboo)|fady]] – a taboo – among the Tsimihety.{{sfn|Bradt|2007|p=14}} The main economic center among the Tsimihety is in Mandritsara.{{sfn|Bradt|2007|p=424}}

{{Women in society sidebar| By country}}
The roles of German women have changed throughout history, especially during the past few decades, during which the culture has undergone rapid change.

==Historical context==
The traditional role of women in [[Culture of Germany|German society]] was often described by the so-called "four Ks" in the German language: ''Kinder'' (children), ''Kirche'' ([[Religion in Germany|church]]), ''Küche'' ([[German cuisine|kitchen]]), and ''Kleider'' (clothes), indicating that their main duties were bearing and rearing children, attending to religious activities, cooking and serving food, and dealing with clothes and fashion. However, their roles changed during the 20th century. After obtaining the right to vote in 1919, German women began to take on active roles previously performed by men. After the end of [[World War II]], they were labeled as the ''[[Trümmerfrau]]en'' or "women of the [[rubble]]" because they took care of the "wounded, buried the dead, salvaged belongings", and participated in the "hard task of rebuilding war-torn Germany by simply clearing away" the rubble and ruins of war.&lt;ref name=GC&gt;[http://www.germanculture.com.ua/library/facts/bl_women.htm Women In German Society], German Culture, germanculture.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Although conservative in many ways, Germany nevertheless differs from other German-speaking regions in Europe, being much more progressive on women's right to be politically involved, compared to neighbouring [[Switzerland]] (where women obtained the right to vote in 1971 at federal level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bonnie G. Smith, ed.|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&amp;pg=RA3-PA171|year= 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=171 vol 1|isbn=9780195148909}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at local [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] level in 1990 in the canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8019766.stm|title=Naked Swiss hikers must cover up|author=|date=27 April 2009|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Liechtenstein]] [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984|in 1984]]. In Germany, there are also strong regional differences; for instance [[Southern Germany]] (particularly [[Bavaria]]) is more conservative than other parts of Germany; while former East Germany is more supporting of women's professional life than former West Germany.&lt;ref name="demographic-research.org"&gt;http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol33/9/33-9.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family law==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-0807-017, Leipzig, Familienszene.jpg|thumb|left|Woman and her husband, both medical students, and their triplets in the [[East Germany]] (GDR) in 1984; the GDR encouraged births among educated women.]]
[[Family law]] in [[West Germany]], had, until recently, assigned women a subordinate role in relation to their husbands. It was only in 1977 that legislative changes provided for [[gender equality]] in marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Reconciliation Policy in Germany 1998–2008, Construing the 'Problem' of the Incompatibility of Paid Employment and Care Work, by Cornelius Grebe; pg 92: ''"However, the 1977 reform of marriage and family law by Social Democrats and Liberals formally gave women the right to take up employment without their spouses' permission. This marked the legal end of the 'housewife marriage' and a transition to the ideal of 'marriage in partnership'."''[https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-531-91924-9]&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[East Germany]] however, women had more rights, and were encouraged to participate in the labor force.

In 1977, the [[Divorce law by country|divorce law]] in West Germany underwent major changes, moving from a [[Divorce#At-fault divorce|fault based divorce]] system to one that is primarily [[no fault divorce|no fault]]. These new divorce regulations, which remain in force today throughout Germany, stipulate that a no-fault divorce can be obtained on the grounds of one year of ''de facto'' separation if both spouses consent, and three years of ''de facto'' separation if only one spouse consents. There is also provision for a "speedy divorce" which can be obtained on demand by either spouse, without the necessary separation period, if it is proved in court that the continuation of the marriage would constitute an unreasonable hardship for the petitioner for reasons related to the behavior of the other spouse; this exemption requires exceptional circumstances and is considered on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impowr.org/content/current-legal-framework-divorce-germany|title=Current Legal Framework: Divorce in Germany - impowr.org|author=|date=|website=www.impowr.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ceflonline.net/wp-content/uploads/Germany-Divorce.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, in Germany, as in other Western countries, there has been a rapid increase in unmarried [[cohabitation]] and births outside of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/lawfam/article/15/1/88/919686|title=Cohabitation in Germany - rules, reality and public discourses|first=I.|last=Ostner|date=1 April 2001|publisher=|journal=International Journal of Law, Policy and the Family|volume=15|issue=1|pages=88–101|accessdate=17 April 2018|via=lawfam.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1093/lawfam/15.1.88}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, 35% of births in Germany were to unmarried women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00018|title=Eurostat - Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table|author=|date=|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are, however, marked differences between the regions of the former West Germany and East Germany: significantly more children are born out of wedlock in eastern Germany than in western Germany: in 2012, in eastern Germany 61.6% of births were to unmarried women, but in western Germany only 28.4%.&lt;ref name="demographic-research.org"/&gt;

The views on sexual self-determination, as it relates to marriage, have also changed: for instance until 1969 [[adultery]] was a criminal offense in West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impowr.org/content/summary-adultery-germany|title=Summary: Adultery in Germany - impowr.org|author=|date=|website=www.impowr.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in 1997, however, that Germany removed its [[marital rape|marital exemption]] from [[rape in Germany|its rape law]], being one of the last Western countries to do so, after a lengthy political battle that started in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jurawelt.com/sunrise/media/mediafiles/13792/tenea_juraweltbd52_kieler.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breaking Male Dominance in Old Democracies.Oxford University Press 2013. Edt Drude Dahlerup and Monique Leyenaar; pg 205: ''"Concerning gender equality issues, some policies improved; for example, marital rape was finally prohibited. Germany was until 1997 one of the few post-industrialized countries where marital rape was not forbidden. The law was forced by female politicians from all parties and women's rights activists. In fact, it was one of the few instances where women from all parties supported a proposal, finally convincing the male MPs of their parties to agree. Women had been lobbying for this law for years, but were not heard until the late 1990s, when the number of women in all parties had increased."''[http://drudedahlerup.com/2013/09/06/new-book-breaking-male-dominance-in-old-democracies/]&lt;/ref&gt;

While women in East Germany were encouraged to participate in the workforce, this was not the case in West Germany, where a woman's primary role was understood to be at home, taking care of her family. In recent years, more women are working for pay. Although most women are employed, many work part-time; in the European Union, only the Netherlands and Austria have more women working part-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=ro&amp;catId=89&amp;newsId=2535&amp;furtherNews=yes|title=Part-time work: A divided Europe|author=|date=|website=europa.eu|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One problem that women have to face is that mothers who have young children and want to pursue a career may face social criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/23/world/europe/23iht-germany.html|title=German fights stigma against working mothers|first=Mark|last=Landler|date=23 April 2006|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/study-german-efforts-to-increase-birthrate-a-failure-a-873635.html|title=Baby Blues: German Efforts to Improve Birthrate a Failure|author=|date=18 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2018|via=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the governing coalition agreed to impose a 30% female [[quota share|quota]] for [[Supervisory board]] positions from 2016 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30208400|title=Germany backs female directors quota|author=|date=26 November 2014|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to other Western and even non-Western countries, Germany has a low proportion of women in business leadership roles, lower even than Turkey, Malaysia, Nigeria, Indonesia, Botswana, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grantthornton.global/en/press/press-releases-2015/women-in-business-2015/|title=Women in business 2015 results|author=|date=|website=Grant Thornton International Ltd. Home|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons for the low presence of women in key positions is the social norm that considers full-time work inappropriate for women. Especially Southern Germany is conservative regarding gender roles. In 2011, [[José Manuel Barroso]], then president of the [[European Commission]], stated "Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, should look at the example of the northern countries [...] that means removing obstacles for women, older workers, foreigners and low-skilled job-seekers to get into the workforce".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-persistently-low-birthrate-gets-marginal-boost/a-15325123-0|title=Germany's persistently low birthrate gets marginal boost - DW - 18.08.2011|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|date=|website=DW.COM|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abortion in Germany]] is legal during the [[first trimester]] on condition of mandatory counseling, and later in pregnancy in cases of medical necessity. In both cases there is a waiting period of 3 days.

'''Zambo''' ({{IPA-es|ˈθambo|lang}} &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-es|ˈsambo|}}) and '''cafuzo''' ({{IPA-pt|kɐˈfuzu|lang}}) are racial terms used in the [[Casta]] [[caste]] class system of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese empire]]s and occasionally today to identify individuals in the Americas who are of mixed [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] and [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Amerindian]] ancestry (the analogous [[English language|English]] term, ''[[Sambo (racial term)|sambo]]'', is considered a slur). Historically, the racial cross between [[Atlantic slave trade| enslaved African]] and Amerindians was referred to as a ''zambayga'', then ''zambo'', then ''sambo''. In the United States, the word ''sambo'' is thought to refer to the racial cross between an enslaved African and a white person. 

The meaning of the term ''sambo'' however is contested in North America, where other etymologies have been proposed. The word most likely originated from one of the [[Romance language]]s, or [[Latin]] and its direct descendants. The feminine word is ''zamba'' (not to be confused with the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Zamba (artform)|Zamba folk dance]], although there is some relationship in the concept).

Under the [[casta]] system of Spanish  colonial America, the term originally applied to the children of one African and one Amerindian parent, or the children of two zambo parents. During this period, many other terms denoted individuals of African-Amerindian ancestry in ratios smaller or greater than the 50:50 of zambos: ''cambujo'' (zambo-Amerindian mixture) for example. Today, ''zambo'' refers to all people with significant amounts of both African and Amerindian ancestry, though it is frequently considered pejorative.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

==History==
[[Image:Zambo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A representation of an infant ''zambo'', in an 18th-century "Pintura de Castas" from [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]]. The painting illustrates "from a Black and an Amerindian produces a ''lobo''", here a synonym for ''zambo''.]]
The term zambo was not formally used in Spanish writing until the seventeenth century, and often competed with other terms, including ''mulato''. African slaves began mixing with indigenous people from the beginning of their importation into Hispaniola in the early sixteenth century. Some of this mixture took place in the mines and plantations of Hispaniola, the other Spanish Caribbean islands following the introduction of sugar production in the 1520s, and also when Africans fled from these estates to unconquered indigenous regions.

Unions described as producing zambos took place all throughout the Spanish colonial empire, following the pattern established in Hispaniola; and the group was generally classified among those people who were not of European ancestry. In the eighteenth century, the Spanish began producing systematic racial classifications, and zambo was defined in its final meaning.

Some famous zambo groups were created by runaway or rebel Africans who mixed with or took over indigenous communities. In the unconquered regions of Esmeraldes, in what would become [[Ecuador]], for example, a small group of shipwrecked former slaves managed to win control of the indigenous communities, eventually representing them before Spanish authorities in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.

Another famous group of zambos were the [[Miskito Sambu|Misquito Zambos]], who originated around 1640 when a group of African slaves revolted on a slave ship, took it over and wrecked it at Cape [[Gracias a Dios Department|Gracias a Dios]] on the border between [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]]. They united with the indigenous [[Miskito people|Miskito]] people, and by the early eighteenth century came to dominate the kingdom, leading it on many extensive [[slave raids]]. Their alliance and protection of English speaking merchants and settlers in the area helped Great Britain find the colony of [[British Honduras]] (present day [[Belize]]).

==Population today==
[[File:Sambo 1770.jpg|thumb|"From a black man with a ''[[mulatto|mulata]]'' produces a [[Sambo (racial term)|Sambo]]", Indian school, 1770.]]
[[File:Zamba of Mesquititlan.jpg|thumb|"Zamba of [[Mezquititlán]]", [[circa]] 1908]]
Officially, zambos represent small minorities in the northwestern South American countries [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Guyana]], and [[Ecuador]]. A small but noticeable number of zambos resulting from recent unions of Amerindian men to [[Afro-Ecuadorian]] women are not uncommon in major coastal cities of [[Ecuador]]. Prior to the rural to urban migration, the Amerindian and Afro-Ecuadorian ethnicities were mostly constrained to the [[Andes]] region and province of [[Esmeraldas Province|Esmeraldas]] and the [[Chota Valley]] in the province of [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]] respectively.

In [[Central America]], there are two indigenous-African mixed groups, the Miskito and the [[Garifuna people|garifuna]]s.  The Garifuna originated from the combination of Africans who were either shipwrecked or fled from neighboring islands to [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]], in the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In 1797 they were deported by the English for their role in supporting France during the French Revolutionary Wars to the island of [[Roatan]] off the coast of [[Honduras]]. From there they spread up and down the coast of Central America, communities being found from Nicaragua to Belize. 

In [[Mexico]], where zambos were sometimes known as ''lobos'' (literally meaning [[wolf|wolves]]), they form a sizeable minority. According to the 2015 Intercensus Estimate, 896,829 people identified as both [[Afro-Mexican]] and [[Indigenous Mexican]]. The great majority of the country's Afro-descended population has been absorbed into the wider [[mestizo]] population. Greater concentrations can only be found in communities scattered around the southern coastal states, including [[Michoacán]], [[Guerrero]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Campeche]], [[Quintana Roo]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], and [[Veracruz]], where the country's Afro-Mexicans reside.

Culturally, Mexican ''lobos'' followed more Amerindian traditions rather than African influences. This acculturation also took place in [[Bolivia]], where the [[Afro-Bolivian]] community absorbed and retained many aspects of Amerindian cultural influences, such as dress and use of the [[Aymara language]]. These communities of Afro-Bolivians reside in the ''[[Yungas]]'' region of the Bolivian department of [[La Paz]].
