The '''2010 cash for influence scandal''' was a [[Political scandals in the United Kingdom|political scandal]] in the United Kingdom. It was brought to public and widespread media attention by a March 2010 documentary by [[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]] in which a journalistic [[sting operation]] recorded and revealed [[Members of Parliament#United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] and the Lords offering to work for a fictitious political lobbying firm for fees of £3,000 to £5,000 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/7490787/Four-Labour-MPs-implicated-in-cash-for-influence-scandal.html|title=Four Labour MPs implicated in 'cash for influence' scandal |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] online|date=21 March 2010|accessdate=21 March 2010 | location=London | first=Rebecca | last=Lefort| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100324103119/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/7490787/Four-Labour-MPs-implicated-in-cash-for-influence-scandal.html| archivedate= 24 March 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="revealed"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7068820.ece|title=Revealed: Labour’s cash for influence scandal|publisher=[[The Times]] online|date=21 March 2010|accessdate=21 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ex ministers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8578597.stm|title=Ex-ministers in 'cash for influence' row under fire|publisher=[[The BBC]] online|date=21 March 2010|accessdate=21 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100419083737/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8578597.stm| archivedate= 19 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Twenty politicians were approached by the documentary: fifteen agreed to meet, ten arranged meetings, and of those ten, nine were secretly filmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/national/pressure_grows_for_cash_for_lobbying_probe_1_368610|title=Pressure grows for 'cash for lobbying' probe|publisher=[[Peterborough Evening Telegraph]]|date=22 March 2010|accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These nine included the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP, Sir [[John Butterfill]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MPs [[Stephen Byers]], [[Patricia Hewitt]], [[Geoff Hoon]], [[Richard Caborn]], [[Adam Ingram (Labour politician)|Adam Ingram]] and [[Margaret Moran]]. The Labour members were all due to stand down at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|next general election]] and all but Moran have been cabinet ministers. Byers had been Transport Secretary ([[Stephen Byers#Increasing pressure on Byers and exit from Government|resigned]] 29 May 2002);Hoon Defence and then Transport Secretary ([[Geoff Hoon#Secretary of State for Transport|resigned]] 5 June 2009); Hewitt Health Secretary ([[Patricia Hewitt#Retirement from the cabinet|resigned]] 27 June 2007); Caborn [[Department of Culture, Media and Sport|Minister for Sport]] (Resigned 28 June 2007) and Ingram was [[Minister of State for the Armed Forces]] (Resigned 29 June 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/minwhirl.php|title=Ministerial whirl|publisher=[[The Public Whip]]|accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 after criticism surrounding her expense claims the Labour Party had barred Moran from standing again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1179291/MPs-expenses-How-Cabinet-ministers-tens-thousands-flipping-homes.html|title=How cabinet ministers flip homes|publisher=[[The Daily Mail]] online|accessdate=21 March 2010 | location=London | date=12 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/News/Articles/Hoon-in-fresh-expenses-row-746970014.html|title=Hoon in fresh expenses row|publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV.com]]|date=6 April 2009|accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bedfordtoday.co.uk/541/Moran-expenses-inquiry-suspended.5905266.jp|title=Moran expenses inquiry suspended|publisher=Bedford today.com|date=11 December 2009|accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative MP [[Julie Kirkbride]] was one of the politicians approached by the fake agency established by the programme, but declined to assist them. It was reported that an unnamed Conservative MP did agree to work for the fake agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/7489046/MPs-caught-by-sleaze-sting.html

The bogus firm was named Anderson Perry, after the Marxist historian [[Perry Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/03/mps-cash-for-influence-the-inside-story|title=MPs cash-for-influence: the inside story|publisher=[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect Magazine]]|date=25 March 2010|accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== False interviews ==

Members of Parliament were invited to an interview by an undercover reporter claiming to be the director of a company hoping to influence policy.&lt;ref name="revealed"  /&gt; They were met and secretly recorded. The story was broken by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' Insight team and followed up with the Dispatches documentary. Amongst the controversial comments made to the reporter were Geoff Hoon saying he wanted to make "some real money," Margaret Moran boasting she could call on a "girls' gang" of female ministers to help the fictitious company, and Stephen Byers describing himself as "sort of like a cab for hire."

=== Byers' interview ===

Byers made claims of having influenced government policy in the past for money. He claimed to have spoken with [[Peter Mandelson]] and [[Lord Adonis]] in the past to influence outcomes for [[National Express]] and [[Tesco]]. Lord Adonis admitted having private discussions with Byers about it but denied that he had "come to any arrangement",&lt;ref name="telesting"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/7500690/Lobbying-row-Lord-Adonis-admits-he-had-private-discussion-with-Stephen-Byers.html|title=Lord Adonis admits he had private discussion with Stephen Byers|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] online|date=23 March 2010|accessdate=23 March 2010 | location=London | first=Robert | last=Winnett| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100326220337/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/7500690/Lobbying-row-Lord-Adonis-admits-he-had-private-discussion-with-Stephen-Byers.html| archivedate= 26 March 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mandelson said he remembered no such discussion or meeting.&lt;ref name="sting"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/mar/21/lobbying-sting-labour-mps-influence|title=Stephen Byers claims no rules were broken during lobbying stinglobbying sting|publisher=[[The Guardian]] online|date=21 March 2010|accessdate=21 March 2010 | location=London | first1=Anushka | last1=Asthana | first2=Toby | last2=Helm| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100324155556/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/mar/21/lobbying-sting-labour-mps-influence| archivedate= 24 March 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byers later withdrew his name for consideration by the fictitious lobbying company via email, claiming he had over-stated his role and wrote "I have not spoken to Andrew Adonis or Peter Mandelson about the matters I mentioned." When the story broke, National Express and Tesco also denied there was any truth in Byers' statements.&lt;ref name="sting" /&gt;

=== Butterfill's Interview ===

[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP Sir [[John Butterfill]] was also implicated and offered to lobby to benefit the fictitious company and use his political connections for a payment of £35000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/03/21/tory-mp-sir-john-butterfill-offered-access-to-chiefs-for-35-000-115875-22127197|title=Tory MP Sir John Butterfill offered access to chiefs for £35,000|publisher=[[Daily Mirror|The Daily Mirror]]|date=21 March 2010|accessdate=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butterfill was also seen on the programme saying that it was likely that he would be made a [[peerage|peer]] and go to the [[House of Lords]], the following day the leader of the Conservative Party, David Cameron said, "I can tell you that is not going to happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23818081-cameron-dashes-tory-butterfills-peerage-hopes-after-lobby-firm-boasts.do |title=Cameron dashes Tory Butterfill's peerage hopes after 'lobby firm boasts' |publisher=[[The London Evening Standard]] |date=23 March 2010 |accessdate=23 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326203601/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23818081-cameron-dashes-tory-butterfills-peerage-hopes-after-lobby-firm-boasts.do |archivedate=26 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hoon's Interview ===
Geoff Hoon was interviewed shortly after a trip to Washington where he had undertaken 
: ''Three days of Nato work then a couple of days of Hoon work''. 
In the interview he went on to state that 
: ''One of the challenges I think I am really looking forward to is sort of translating my knowledge and contacts about sort of international scene into something that bluntly makes money''
and further argued that 
:''There will be opportunities for American companies in particular to look around at some (em) vulnerable European companies because those companies will become vulnerable as their own governments cut back on defence spending. I foresee, its one reason why I'm talking to American private equity firms, I foresee a period where we may well see American companies in effect, buying market share in Europe because they will be buying up national champions who are not getting the support they need to, to continue.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/articles/politicians-for-hire-video  Channel 4 Dispatches: Politicians for hire, Transmitted Monday 22 March 2010 8pm on Channel 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/4od#3051050  Channel 4 Dispatches: Politicians for hire, Transmitted Monday 22 March 2010 8pm on Channel 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political response ==

Foreign Secretary [[David Miliband]] said he was "appalled" and Chancellor [[Alistair Darling]] said it was "ridiculous". [[Norman Baker]], of the Liberal Democrats, will be referring the matter to the [[Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards]]. The leader of the Opposition, [[David Cameron]], described the matter as "shocking" and called for an inquiry.&lt;ref name="ex ministers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sting" /&gt; Stephen Byers referred himself to the parliamentary commissioner for standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/mar/22/stephen-byers-lobbying-claim-watchdog|title=Stephen Byers refers himself to watchdog over lobbying claims|publisher=[[The Guardian]] on-line|date=22 March 2010|accessdate=22 March 2010 | location=London | first1=Patrick | last1=Wintour | first2=Andrew | last2=Sparrow| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100324193714/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/mar/22/stephen-byers-lobbying-claim-watchdog| archivedate= 24 March 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 2010 it was announced that Patricia Hewitt, Geoff Hoon, Margaret Moran and Stephen Byers had been suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party. Geoff Hoon told the [[BBC]] that [[Gordon Brown]] had told him he would no longer be performing unpaid work with [[NATO]] on behalf of the government. Meanwhile, David Cameron launched a call for a full inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Politics/Lobby-Row-Stephen-Byers-Patricia-Hewitt-And-Geoff-Hoon-Are-Suspended-From-Parliamentary-Party/Article/201003415579686?lpos=Politics_First_Poilitics_Article_Teaser_Regi_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15579686_Lobby_Row%3A_Stephen_Byers%2C_Patricia_Hewitt_And_Geoff_Hoon_Are_Suspended_From_Parliamentary_Party|title=Labour Suspends 'Cash-For-Lobby' MPs |publisher=[[Sky News]] on-line|date=22 March 2010|accessdate=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-demands-inquiry-into-lobbying-row-1925828.html|title=David Cameron demands inquiry into lobbying row|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=23 March 2010|accessdate=23 March 2010 | location=London | first1=Daniel | last1=Bentley | first2=Andrew | last2=Woodcock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 December 2010, [[Geoff Hoon]] along with [[Stephen Byers]] and [[Richard Caborn]] were banned from parliament, the [[Standards and Privileges Committee]] banned Geoff Hoon for a minimum five years as his was the most serious breach, whilst Byers received two years and Caborn six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Politics/Geoff-Hoon-Stephen-Byers-And-Geoff-Hoon-Could-All-Be-Banned-From-Houses-Of-Parliament/Article/201012215850598?lpos=Politics_Second_UK_News_Article_Teaser_Region_1&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15850598_Geoff_Hoon,_Stephen_Byers_And_Geoff_Hoon_Could_All_Be_Banned_From_Houses_Of_Parliament |title=Three Former MPs Face Parliamentary Ban |accessdate=9 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217015435/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Politics/Geoff-Hoon-Stephen-Byers-And-Geoff-Hoon-Could-All-Be-Banned-From-Houses-Of-Parliament/Article/201012215850598?lpos=Politics_Second_UK_News_Article_Teaser_Region_1&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15850598_Geoff_Hoon%2C_Stephen_Byers_And_Geoff_Hoon_Could_All_Be_Banned_From_Houses_Of_Parliament |archivedate=17 December 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media response ==

The media was especially critical of Stephen Byers, who claimed to have lobbied for money in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-demands-probe-into-shocking-lobbying-claims-1924892.html|title=Cameron demands probe into shocking lobbying claims|publisher=[[The Independent]] online|date=21 March 2010|accessdate=21 March 2010 | location=London | first1=Joe | last1=Churcher| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100324153653/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-demands-probe-into-shocking-lobbying-claims-1924892.html| archivedate= 24 March 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LGBT strike 22-07-2018.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Protesters in main demonstration "Equality for the LGBT community" at Rabin Square]]
On July 22, 2018 Israeli LGBTs went on [[Strike action|strike]] for the day to protest against the [[discrimination]] of the [[LGBT community]] on the Israeli [[Surrogacy]] Law, and the continuing violence towards the Israeli trans community. During the strike, that was held on the same day as the fast of [[Tisha B'Av]], many organizations and companies allowed their employees to be absent to participate in the many protest events that were held throughout the day across the country, including [[Tel Aviv-Jaffa]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Haifa]], [[Be'er Sheba|Beersheba]], [[Ra'anana]] and other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/widespread-support-for-lgbt-strike-over-exclusion-from-new-surrogacy-legislation/|title=Widespread backing for LGBT strike Sunday over exclusion from new surrogacy law|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strike was the first LGBT strike in history.

== Background ==
[[File:LGBT_strike_05.jpg|thumb|Protesters in the main rally in Rabin Square]]
Following a [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] case regarding the Israeli Surrogacy Law that was legislated in 1997, appealing to include gay couples in the law, the State's response to the court was that the law will be amended. To make the appropriate changes, the government formed several professional health committees, such as the Mor-Yosef committee, that passed along its recommendations to Minister of Health, [[Yael German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.gov.il/English/News_and_Events/Spokespersons_Messages/Pages/20052012_1.aspx|title=Public commission for fertility and childbirth submitted findings to Ministry of Health|last=|first=|date=25 May 2012|website=Ministry of Health|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 34th government was formed, headed by [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], this issue was discussed in the [[Knesset|Knesset's]] Labour, Welfare, and Health Committee headed by [[Eli Alalouf|Eli Alaluf]]. In the proceedings to bring the bill to a second and third reading, the committee voted to add single women to the bill, while still excluding single men and gay couples from using surrogacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-knesset-panel-okays-surrogacy-for-single-women-but-not-gay-couples-1.6219117|title=Knesset Panel Okays Surrogacy for Single Women but Not Gay Couples|last=Yaron|first=Lee|date=2018-06-27|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was brought to its second and third reading on July 18, 2018, with reservations, including one by [[Amir Ohana]] of the [[Likud Party]], adding single men to the bill. Because of the stance declared by the ultra-orthodox factions in the [[coalition]], headed by the [[United Torah Judaism]], the coalition decided to oppose the reservation while supporting the original amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5312433,00.html|title=Surrogacy bill excluding LGBT couples passes into law|date=2018-07-18|work=Ynetnews|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to the vote, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu published a video to his Facebook page, explaining that he will support a future amendment to the bill that will be brought by MK Ohana during the Knesset's Winter Session, to allow single men to use surrogacy in Israel, but despite his support, he voted against Ohana's reservation. The Knesset than passed the amended bill in its original form with 59 for and 52 against.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/caving-to-ultra-orthodox-netanyahu-about-faces-on-gay-surrogacy-rights/|title=Caving to ultra-Orthodox, Netanyahu about-faces on gay surrogacy rights|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other pressing issues during that time were several lesbian couples who are fighting for the state's recognition of their joint parenthood, and in at least one case that went public, 2 women found out that they were unilaterally removed as the second parents from their children's birth certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/07/26/israels-high-court-slams-states-treatment-of-same-sex-parents/|title=Israel's high court slams state's treatment of same-sex parents|work=PinkNews|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the vote, on July 14 and July 17, demonstrations against it were held in Tel Aviv and in Jerusalem. On July 19, protesters walked to the government office building in Tel Aviv.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Around the same time, on July 17, a [[sex worker]] [[trans woman]] was stabbed in her apartment in south Tel Aviv.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Planning ==
As a result of the vote on the bill and the reservation, [[The Aguda]] called members of the LGBT community to strike on Sunday, July 22 (Sunday being the first workday in Israel).

The roots for this strike were planted a year prior to that, in a cooperation of LGBT organizations in the country. The idea started rolling after a protest in July 2017, which brought around 15,000 protesters against the [[Ministry of Social Affairs and Social Services|Ministry of Welfare's]] stance in a Supreme Court hearing regarding [[adoption]] by [[same-sex couple]]. In a [[position paper]] presented to court, the ministry claimed that same-sex parents are "anomalous" and therefore cannot become adoptive families. After receiving a lot of public pressure, welfare minister [[Haim Katz]] announced that he plans on changing the ministry's stance on this issue. In order to plan the strike, many PR and advertising agencies and journalists were contacted to pressure companies in Israel to prepare for a future strike.

When the new surrogacy law passed in the Knesset, to include only single women but not single men or gay couples, in a way perceived as discriminatory, the LGBT organizations, headed by the Aguda, decided to implement the strike plan immediately.The organizers contacted [[Chief executive officer|CEO's]] and prominent public figures and asked them to join the strike and have their companies and organizations publish their support. Most of them agreed, though some in some cases they gave their support after being told by the organizers that their lack of support will be made public on media and on social media. An Israeli economic publication, [[The Marker]], posted a list of companies that refused to support the strike.

=== Corporate sector's support ===
Many Israeli companies and workers unions announced that they will allow their employees to strike in order to attend the protests, without risking their jobs or deducting their pay. In the few days before the strike, more than 250 publicly and privately own businesses announced their support for LGBT equality, and allowed their employees to stay home in order to strike and attend the protests. Some of the companies allowed their employees to use a personal day or an elective day, while some gave the employees a paid one-day leave. One of the first companies to join the strike was Microsoft Israel, that later announced that it will give its employees a grant if they choose and need to use surrogacy outside the country. The companies that supported were from various sectors: law firms, restaurants, architecture firms, communication providers, travel agencies and hi-tech companies, along with big public and government sector organizations, including Ben Gurion Airport, Haifa and Ashdod ports, El-Al and Israir, Teva, Tnuva, cellphone, landline, cable and satellite providers, municipalities, hospitals and emergency services, food chains and supermarkets, banks, credit card companies and more. This was the biggest ever support by businesses for a social cause in Israel, and the first LGBT strike in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/LGBT-campaign-snowballs-as-hundreds-of-companies-support-nationwide-strike-563099|title=LGBT campaign snowballs as hundreds of companies support nationwide strike|work=The Jerusalem Post|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israel-wide-strike-slated-as-tech-firms-protest-lgbt-discrimination-1.6292108|title=Israel-wide Strike Slated as Tech Firms Protest anti-LGBT Legislation|last=Levy|first=Ruti|date=2018-07-19|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-07-27|last2=Yaron|first2=Lee|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel's [[Workers Union|Workers' Union]], the [[Histadrut]], issued a statement that is supports both the protest and the strike, and called employers in the public and private sector to allow employees to strike without harming their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-gears-up-for-strike-protests-by-lgbt-community-over-new-surrogacy-law/|title=Thousands to join day-long strike Sunday by LGBT community over surrogacy law|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}During the day of the strike, some 1000 strikers in Tel Aviv demonstrated and marched from the government office building on HaShalom Intersection, through [[Ayalon Highway]] to [[Rothschild Boulevard]], where a field studio was built, broadcasting live interviews throughout the day. In Jerusalem's France (Paris) Square, outside the Prime Minister's official residence, 250 protesters demonstrated and blocked roads. The police detained 3 demonstrators only to release them later that day. More demonstrations were held around the country – in Haifa's main road, the entrance to Karmiel and other major junctions across the country.

Roads were blocked by protesters in several cities, some of them were main city roads. Around 1000 protesters blocked HaShalom intersection and marched down to the highway, chanting about equality for all, social justice and government-backed discrimination. Protesters also blocked roads in other cities; In a demonstration on Ragher avenue, the main road in Beersheba, a driver tried running over a protester. The end of the protest day was marked with a march in [[Florentin, Tel Aviv|Florentin]] in south Tel Aviv, supporting the transgender community, following an attempted murder of a trans woman sex worker a few days prior. This attack was the peak of many transphobic acts of violence in Israel. The march ended in the Tel Aviv Central Bus Station, a location known as a center of prostitution, and was attended by around 6000 people, making it the largest transgender demonstration in Israel, to date.

=== Rabin Square rally ===
The strike day, along with its demonstrations and protests against anti-LGBT discrimination and violence, culminated in a rally in Rabin Square in central Tel Aviv. According to police estimate, between 80,000 and 100,000 people attended that rally. The rally was hosted by TV presenters [[Lucy Aharish]] and [[Nadav Borenstein]], and among the speakers were former parliament member and longtime human rights activist [[Yael Dayan]], actress [[Orna Banai]], and Orly and Ravit Weiselberg-Tzur, who were to appear in front of the Supreme Court the next day in their case pleading to register both of them as their son's parents. Many artists also performed at the rally, like [[Rita (Israeli singer)|Rita]], [[Dana International]], Ilay Botner, [[Ran Danker]], [[Korin Alal]], [[Rona Keinan|Rona Kenan]] and others. All main Israeli broadcast networks dedicated a major part of their programs to the strike, and broadcast live from different demonstrations across Israel, from the strike headquarters in Rothschild Avenue and from the rally in Rabin Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/tens-of-thousands-protest-in-tel-aviv-over-lgbt-exclusion-from-surrogacy-law/|title=100,000 protest in Tel Aviv over anti-LGBT discrimination|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''All-America Anti-Imperialist League''' (also known as '''Anti-Imperialist League of the Americas''', [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Liga Antiimperialista de las Americas'' (''LADLA'')) was an international [[mass organization]] of [[Communist International]] established in 1925 to organize against [[United States of America|American]] and [[Europe|European]] commercial expansion and military intervention in [[Central America]], [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean]].

The organization was terminated in 1933 and replaced by a new Communist Party-sponsored group, the [[American League Against War and Fascism]].

==History==

===Background===

In the early 1920s, many Communist Parties affiliated with the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) maintained "Anti-Imperialist Departments" dedicated to building broad coalitions in opposition to the economic and military intervention of [[capitalism|capitalist]] powers in the affairs of smaller [[colony|colonial]] nations.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Shipman, ''It Had to Be Revolution: Memoirs of an American Radical.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1993; pp. 153-154.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Western hemisphere this took the form of organizing against the expansion of American commercial influence in the developing nations of [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] as well as the [[Caribbean]] basin, including especially [[Mexico]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Cuba]], and [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref name=Shipman154&gt;Shipman, ''It Had to Be Revolution,'' pg. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States itself, the Anti-Imperialist Department of the well-funded [[Communist Party USA|Workers (Communist) Party of America]] was [[Charles Shipman]] (1895-1989), a draft-resisting American expatriate to Mexico who as "Jesús Ramírez" had been a delegate representing that country at the [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern]].&lt;ref&gt;See Shipman's memoir, ''It Had to Be Revolution,'' pp. 92-127.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[Latin America]]n concerns, Shipman's department had also propagandized against American commercial and military involvement in other parts of the globe, including particularly the [[Philippines]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name=Shipman154 /&gt;

===Establishment===

In April 1925 Shipman was dispatched to Mexico as the representative of the Workers Party to the 3rd Congress of the [[Communist Party of Mexico]].&lt;ref name=Shipman154 /&gt; It was at this time that a new international organization was launched, the All-America Anti-Imperialist League — an organization which would eventually include national sections throughout Latin America.&lt;ref name=Shipman155&gt;Shipman, ''It Had to Be Revolution,'' pg. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "All-America" in the organizational moniker was not intended to relate specifically to the United States, but rather to the fact that the organization included sections from throughout the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Similarly, the Russian Communist Party was in this period referred to as the "All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)." The official Spanish name of the League captures the essence better, "Liga Antiimperialista de las Americas" (Anti-Imperialist League of the Americas).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although itself an international group, the All-American Anti-Imperialist League was in turn attached to another Comintern-sponsored international organization, the [[League Against Imperialism]].&lt;ref name=Part9&gt;[[J. B. Matthews]] (ed.), "All-America Anti-Imperialist League," in Special Committee on Un-American Activities, ''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix — Part IX: Communist Front Organizations with Special Reference to the National Citizens Political Action Committee.'' First Section, Second Section, and Third Section. Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 1944; pp. 310-311.&lt;/ref&gt; This federation included other similar regional organizations to the All-American Anti-Imperialist League, groups engaged in parallel activity in other parts of the world.

===Development===

In the United States Charles Shipman was named as Secretary of the American Section of the All-American Anti-Imperialist League and given the task of formally organizing units of the new group.&lt;ref&gt;Shipman, ''It Had to Be Revolution,'' pp. 156-157.&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers were sent to [[trade union]] locals in an effort to stir up interest but the effort was largely futile, with these representatives generally denied admission.&lt;ref name=Shipman157&gt;Shipman, ''It Had to Be Revolution,'' pg. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The cause was more successfully promoted in the labor press, however, with the Communist-controlled [[Federated Press]] news service providing substantial coverage of the organizing effort.&lt;ref name=Shipman157 /&gt;

The organizing effort benefited from a sizable donation by wealthy Chicago liberal William H. Holly, and a number of prominent public figures allowed their names to be used on the group's letterhead to bolster fundraising, including [[NAACP]] executive [[William Pickens]], civil liberties activist [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Roger Baldwin]], literary critic [[Lewis Gannett]], and public intellectuals [[Robert Morss Lovett]] and [[Arthur Garfield Hays]].&lt;ref name=Shipman157 /&gt; These friendly non-communist figures were joined in the public spotlight by a number of well-known public figures who maintained Workers Party membership, including writer [[Scott Nearing]] and trade union official [[William Z. Foster]].&lt;ref name=Shipman157 /&gt;

In later years the All-America Anti-Imperialist League was known simply as the "Anti-Imperialist League."&lt;ref name=Part9 /&gt; The organization maintained its headquarters in a single room located at 32 Union Square, New York City, part of a suite occupied by the Communist-sponsored literary magazine, ''[[New Masses|The New Masses]].''&lt;ref&gt;Shipman, ''It Had to Be Revolution,'' pp. 165-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in the American Section of the league was through payment of annual dues of $1 — although donations of $10 from those with the means to pay were actively solicited.&lt;ref&gt;All-America Anti-Imperialist League (US Section), Defeat the War Against Nicaragua. New York: All-America Anti-Imperialist League (US Section), n.d. [1928]; pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kellogg Statement===

On January 13, 1927, [[Secretary of State]] [[Frank B. Kellogg]] garnered front page headlines across America when he presented an extensive statement to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref name=Base&gt;"Mexico is Base for Communist Plot Against United States, Kellogg Tells Senate Foreign Affairs Committee," ''Reading [PA] Times,'' vol. 68, no. 274, whole no. 21,342 (Jan. 13, 1927), pp. 1, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Kellogg depicted the All-American Anti-Imperialist League as the bulwark of Soviet revolutionism in the Western Hemisphere.

Kellogg told the assembled Senators: "The Bolshevik leaders have very definite ideas with respect to the role which Mexico and Latin America are to play in their general program of world revolution. Thus, Latin America and Mexico are conceived as a base for activities against the United States."&lt;ref name=Base /&gt; He pointedly noted the Mexican focus of operations of the All-American Anti-Imperialist League, publishing center of the international organization.&lt;ref name=Base /&gt;

===1927 Brussels Congress===

In February 1927, Secretary of the American Section Charles Shipman other national leaders of the Anti-Imperialist League were made a delegate to an international convention in [[Brussels]] sponsored by the Communist International, called the Congress Against Colonial Oppression and Imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;Shipman, ''It Had to Be Revolution,'' pp. 162-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Termination===

In 1933 the All-America Anti-Imperialist League was formally terminated and a new organization launched in its stead, the [[American League Against War and Fascism]].&lt;ref name=Part9 /&gt; The new organization focused instead on the developing political situation in Europe, attempting to build a [[Popular Front]] in opposition to [[fascism|fascist]] [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Italian Fascism|Italy]].

The '''American Populist Party''', founded in 2009, was a minor [[political party]] which claims to advocate "classical liberalism" and a return to what they call "genuine" Constitutional government. As such it is an amalgam of [[classical liberalism]] and [[conservatism|modern conservatism]]. The American Populist Party should not be confused with the [[Populist Party of America]] or any of the several other American parties called "Populist", and it has no relationship to several historical parties of the same name.  The American Populist Party is a coalition of grass roots activists, ranging in political ideology from the left to the right, who are working to enact Constitutional reforms through the amendment process.

==History==
The American Populist Party was founded in early 2009 with the intent of introducing a series of 14 Constitutional Amendments to guarantee that the United States government respects the limits prescribed for it by the People. Since October 2009 the party opened offices in five states, including California, Colorado, Texas, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. The party identified with historical parties of the same name, in the areas of preventing poverty, curtailing [[corporate abuses]], and the quest for a sound monetary policy.&lt;ref&gt;Hild, Matthew (2007). ''Greenbackers, Knights of Labor, and Populists, Farmer-Labor Insurgency in the Late-Nineteenth-Century South.''The University of Georgia Press, Athens &amp; London, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; It diverges from them with its emphasis on Constitutional methods to accomplish those goals.

==Platform==
The American Populist Party is based on the classical political ideology of the key [[Founding Fathers of the United States of America]]. It invokes natural rights as espoused by John Locke, and idealizes Rousseau's philosophy of the social contract. The party platform considers the US Constitution to be an affirmative grant of limited powers by the people to the federal government, for the express purpose of protecting the natural rights of individuals as well as the integrity and sovereignty of the several states. As such it emphasizes checks and balances and the separation and non-delegation of powers. The party platform adheres to the practical pillars of modern conservatism, including [[small government]], fiscal sanity, a sound defense posture, and the preservation of individual rights and freedoms, but it rejects [[social conservatism]] in favor of [[libertarian]] social ideals. The platform emphasized the importance of limiting special interest influence in national politics, and advocates fiscal transparency through rigorous audits and oversight, as well as background checks for elected officials. The party's proposed Constitutional amendments were focused in three areas: fiscal limits on the federal government, restoring the balance of political power between the States and the federal government, and constraining the judiciary regarding the interpretation of the Constitution.

The '''Arab Revolutionary Workers Party''' ({{lang-ar|حزب العمال الثوري العربي}} ''Hizb Al-'Amal Al-Thawriy Al-'Arabi'') is a [[political party]] active in [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Democratic Institute]].

Many factions opposed to [[Siad Barre]] set aside tribal and political differences to unite in purpose to overthrow his regime.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} After the collapse of Siad Barre's government in 1991 the nation fell into a long period of increasingly chaotic conflict between forces of clans, militias, warlords, separatist, religious functions and rebellion movements, other nations, and even the United Nations Peace Keepers. 

The powers that overthrew Siad Barre were composed of various clan-predominated factions, from the Hawiye-based [[United Somali Congress]] (USC) to the Ogadeni and Harti [[Somali Patriotic Movement]] (SPM), the Gadabursi-based [[Factions in the Somali Civil War#Somali Democratic Alliance .28SDA.29|Somali Democratic Alliance]] (SDA), Majerteen-based [[Somali Salvation Democratic Front]] (SSDF) and the Isaaq-based Somali National Movement (SNM).

==Reconciliation and Disarmament Efforts==

{{main|Disarmament in Somalia}}

Various peacemaking and peacekeeping efforts were attempted, but all were destined for failure until most all parties had agreed to the formation of a new international community-backed [[Transitional Federal Government]], which finally occurred 2004 in Djibouti.

===1991 First Attempts at Reconciliation===

During the Somali civil war, a "Manifesto" was produced and supported by many of the rebel leaders. From this "Manifesto," a rebel government was formed in January 1991. Because the "Manifesto" was mostly supported by the United Somali Congress, this governmental movement became known as "USC 91." However, since not all rebel leaders were signatories, and because many other factions did not wish to submit to the USC's leadership, the "Manifesto" or "USC 91" government failed to be recognized as legitimate by all parties and was not recognized by the international community.&lt;ref name=Manifesto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wardheernews.com/Articles_09/Feb/09_djibouti_conference_hirad.html |title=Djibouti's Fourth Somali Peace Conference Is It the End of Political Partisanship? |accessdate=2009-08-11 |date=2009-02-09 |publisher=WardheerNews |author=Hirad, Abdalla Ahmed |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416003433/http://wardheernews.com/Articles_09/Feb/09_djibouti_conference_hirad.html |archivedate=2009-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt at Somali national reconciliation was conference was held in [[Djibouti]], between 5–11 June 1991 (Djibouti I). Four factions participated. A second conference (Djibouti II) was held in Djibouti in July 1991, but neither produced significant results.&lt;ref name=Somali-Reconcilation-Conferences&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollerafrica.com/showArticle.php?catId=1&amp;artId=216|title=Somali Reconciliation Conferences: The Unbeaten Track|accessdate=2009-08-11|publisher=holler Africa!|author=Mukhtar, Mohamed H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992-1995 UN Missions to Somalia===
{{main|Unified Task Force}}

In late 1992, UN Secretary General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] proposed an expansion of the UN humanitarian mission to Somalia to include [[nation building]] activities, including the disarming of the warring [[militia]]s of the country. However, in a [[Time Magazine]] article from December 28, 2002, US Special Envoy [[Robert B. Oakley]], said three things were important to a Somali man: "his camel, his wife and his weapon. The [[right to arms|right to bear arms]] is in their soul."&lt;ref name=THE-DILEMMA-OF-DISARMAMENT&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,977374,00.html The Dilemma of Disarmament] Time Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

As Oakley astutely observed, the UN missions to Somalia would not result in the disarmament of the many factions of the Somali Civil War. Too many warlords, as well as too many common Somalis, wished to keep their weapons, and to keep their feuds alive. In 1995, the last of the UN peacekeepers were pulled out of Somalia.

UN Security Council intervention in Somalia's Civil War went back to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 733|Resolution 733]], an [[arms control]] provision which established a weapons embargo on the country.

The list of UN missions to Somalia, and their US operations names, are as follows:

===1993 Conference on National Reconciliation===

In early 1993, concurrent with the UNOSOM I humanitarian mission, fifteen of the warring parties of the [[Somali Civil War]] signed two agreements for national reconciliation and disarmament: an agreement to hold an [[Informal Preparatory Meeting on National Reconciliation]], followed by the [[1993 Addis Ababa Agreement]] made at the [[Conference on National Reconciliation in Somalia]]. Fighting continued, and the agreement later fell apart.

===1997 National Salvation Council===

Organized by [[IGAD]], and held in [[Sodere]], [[Ethiopia]], but boycotted by [[Hussein Aidid]]'s faction as well as the newly-declared government of [[Somaliland]].

===1997 Cairo Peace Conference / Cairo Declaration===

[[Hussein Aidid]] and representatives from 25 clans attended a peace conference in Cairo, in December 1997. While the UN Security Council lauded the efforts, which included decisions to adopt "a federal system with regional autonomy and agreement to form a transitional government of national unity," it still left the country without a national leader, many of the non-attendees balking at the results, and none of the Somali factions agreeing to disarm. Hussein Aidid and [[Ali Mahdi]] were considered opposed to the proposed settlements.&lt;ref name="SOMALIA-FROM-PERMANENT-CONFLICT-TO-MORE-PEACEFULNESS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNSC-WELCOMES-RESUlTS-OF-SOMALI-LEADERS-MEETING-IN-CAIRO&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1997/19971223.SC6459.html Security Council Welcomes Results of Somali Leaders' Meeting in Cairo] UN Security Council&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SOMALIA-ETHIOPIA&gt;[http://www.countrywatch.com/facts/facts_default.aspx?type=text&amp;topic=SESOE Somalia/Ethiopia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222085430/http://www.countrywatch.com/facts/facts_default.aspx?type=text&amp;topic=SESOE |date=February 22, 2007 }} CountryWatch&lt;/ref&gt;

===1998 Baidoa Conference===

The conference was postponed indefinitely and then cancelled after continuous fighting in the city throughout the early part of the year made it impossible to ensure security. Cholera had also broken out in Baidoa around that time. By June, Osman Hassan Ali "Ato" declared the Cairo peace process "dead."&lt;ref name=HORN-OF-AFRICA-MONTHLY-REVIEW-JANUARY-1998&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/eue_web/hoa0198.htm Horn of Africa, Monthly Review, January 1998] UNDP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HORN-OF-AFRICA-MONTHLY-REVIEW-FEBRUARY-1998&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/eue_web/hoa0298.htm Horn of Africa, Monthly Review, February 1998] UNDP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HORN-OF-AFRICA-MONTHLY-REVIEW-MARCH-1998&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/eue_web/hoa0398.htm Horn of Africa, Monthly Review, March 1998] UNDP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HORN-OF-AFRICA-MONTHLY-REVIEW-APRIL-1998&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/eue_web/hoa0498.htm Horn of Africa, Monthly Review, April-May 1998] UNDP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HORN-OF-AFRICA-MONTHLY-REVIEW-MAY-1998&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/eue_web/hoa0598.htm Horn of Africa, Monthly Review, May-June 1998] UNDP&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000 Somalia National Peace Conference ===

Officially dubbed the [[Somalia National Peace Conference]] (SNPC), and sometimes called the [[Djibouti]] conference, this was a series of meetings held in [[Arta, Djibouti|Arta]], [[Djibouti]], on April 20 - May 5, 2000. The conference was aimed at bringing together representatives of the warring factions of Somalia to end the civil war that had claimed over 300,000 lives.&lt;ref name=SOMALIA-NATIONAL-PEACE-CONFERENCE&gt;[http://www.banadir.com/whatisthere.htm Somalia National Peace Conference] Program, hosted at Banadir.com&lt;/ref&gt; The name Transitional National Government (TNG) was selected for the movement at this time.

Annex II of the program for the Conference dealt with cease-fire, disarmament and security. It emphasized:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The desire of the Somali people for peace and security through disarmament is unambiguous. This call is heard repeated throughout the country from all segments of the Somali society, who have consistently demand (sic) an end to violence. Unless this is realized, the entire process of reconciliation, rehabilitation and reconstruction would be jeopardized, if not stillborn. One of the first responsibilities of Somalia's new transitional government will be to insist on an immediate and comprehensive cease-fire, together with binding, complete and simultaneous disarmament of al (sic) militias throughout the country consistent with the agreements they signed from 1991 to 1997, but never implemented.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It took another six years before the transitional government was in a position to implement such a cease-fire and disarmament.

===2001 National Commission for Reconciliation and Property Settlement===

On May 6, 2001, an effort to create a 25-member working body, dubbed the [[National Commission for Reconciliation and Property Settlement]] (NCRPS), was damaged when [[Abdirizak Haji Hussein]], former Prime Minister, was named as its head. The [[Somalia Reconciliation and Restoration Council]] (SRRC) and [[Puntland]] leadership objected strongly. Hussein later resigned on July 25, 2001.

===[[2002 Somali Reconcilliation Conference]]===

Held in Eldoret, Kenya, this conference was attended by most TFG supporters. However, at the time, the [[Rahanweyn Resistance Army]] (RRA) was still hotly contending with other factions, including warlord Adan Madobe-Habsade, who captured Baidoa. The RRA accused the [[Juba Valley Alliance]] of assisting the warlord, an accusation denied by the JVA leader [[Barre Adan Shire Hiiraale]].&lt;ref name=SOMALIA-INTERVIEW-WITH-BARRE-ADAN-SHIRE&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=30536&amp;SelectRegion=Horn_of_Africa&amp;SelectCountry=SOMALIA SOMALIA: Interview with Barre Adan Shire, chairman of the Juba Valley Alliance (JVA)] IRIN&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004 Nairobi Conference===

In January, 2004 a productive conference was held in Nairobi, Kenya, at which the [[Transitional Federal Government]] was agreed to. A document was signed by the major factions, entitled, ''Declaration on the Harmonization of Various Issues Proposed by the Somali Delegates at the Somali Consultative Meetings from 9–29 January 2004''. From this, the Transitional Federal Institutions were agreed to, including elections. However, none of the parties yet had disarmed.&lt;ref name=UN-IN-SOMALIA&gt;[http://www.un-somalia.org/UN_Somalia/index.asp UN in Somalia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225113659/http://www.un-somalia.org/UN_Somalia/index.asp |date=February 25, 2010 }} United Nations Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004 Presidential Elections===

On 10 October [2004], the President of "[[Puntland]]", [[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed]], was elected President of the Somali [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG) with 189 votes. The runner up, Mr. [[Abdullahi Ahmed Addow]] received 79 votes. Before voting, the 25 Presidential candidates swore on the Koran and signed a declaration, pledging to support the elected president and demobilize their militia.&lt;ref name="UN-IN-SOMALIA"/&gt;
The avowed demobilizations never occurred.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4479">The '''Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines''' is an international campaign started by [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF) to increase the availability of [[essential medicines]] in [[developing country|developing countries]]. MSF often has difficulties treating patients because the medicines required are too expensive or are no longer produced. Sometimes, the only drugs available are highly toxic or ineffective, and they often have to resort to inadequate testing methods to diagnose patients.

The lack of research into diseases that affect most of the world’s poor population is known as the [[10-90 gap]] and it occurs because [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] rarely make a profit when developing drugs for these diseases.  Although some countries have created legislation to encourage development of essential but commercially ignored medicines, which are called [[orphan drug]]s in the [[United States]], MSF started this campaign in November 1999 to bring more awareness to the issue, using its prize money from its 1999 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] to fund the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butler|first=Christopher|title=Human Rights and the World Trade Organization: The Right to Essential Medicines and the TRIPS Agreement|journal=Journal of International Law &amp; Policy|year=2007|volume=5|pages=1–27|url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/jil/jilp/articles/5-1_Butler_Christopher.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MSF’s Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines is pushing to lower the prices of existing drugs, vaccines and diagnostic tests, to stimulate research and development into new treatments for diseases that primarily affect the poor, and to overcome other barriers that prevent patients getting the treatment they need.

The Campaign is made up of a team of medical, legal, policy and communications specialists working together to tackle these various issues.

==Conditions==

The Campaign is calling for improvements to the quality of food aid to meet growing children’s nutritional needs. They are also urging a rapid scale-up in the use and production of Ready-to-Use Foods (RUF) to reduce childhood deaths from malnutrition.

It is campaigning for new TB drugs and simple diagnostics to be developed while continuing to call to attention the serious underfunding for TB research.

The Campaign continues to fight to ensure that patients have access to better and improved HIV treatments as well as further scaling up of treatment.

The Campaign supports the use of flexibilities in world trade rules and the creation of a [[patent pool]] &lt;ref&gt;Patent pool, http://www.unitaid.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure that patents don’t get in the way of access to the medicines patients need.

==Research==

The Campaign is working to promote alternative ways of steering and funding medical research to meet the medical needs of people in developing countries, rather than market priorities.

==Policy==
MSF has supported policies that large drugmakers have resisted, in an effort to improve access to essential medicines.&lt;ref name="pmlive"/&gt;

The director of policy advocacy Michelle Childs of MSF said "An important precedent, not just for the people living with HIV within its country, who have been campaigning for this, but also for other developing countries.  As medicines for HIV and hepatitis B are increasingly under patent in developing counties, [[Indonesia]] has shown that countries can and should take action to enable the production of low-cost versions of essential life-saving medicines for their citizens"&lt;ref name="pmlive"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/indonesia_breaks_seven_hiv,_hepatitis_drug_patents_436834#|title=Indonesia breaks seven HIV, hepatitis drug patents

==Work==

===Overview===
''Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol'' consists of a website that hosts a video, an introductory text and an open comments section.&lt;ref name=Rubin9June2015/&gt; Its existence was made public by a [[Facebook]] post from the video's director, [[Ted Lawson]].&lt;ref name=Munro4June2015/&gt; Sulkowicz says they had the idea for the piece in December 2014, and that performance artist [[Marina Abramović]] put them in touch with Lawson to direct it.&lt;ref name=Gambino9June2015/&gt; Lawson told ''ArtNet'' that he thought the piece was "super risky" and courageous.&lt;ref name=Munro4June2015/&gt; Sulkowicz stressed that it was a separate piece from ''Mattress Performance''.&lt;ref name=Sulkowicz4June2015/&gt;

Sulkowicz wrote the script and introductory text, chose the position of the cameras, the lighting and the appearance of it having been filmed by security cameras. The scene was filmed in one continuous take three times during the Columbia spring break in March 2015.&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gambino9June2015/&gt; According to Lawson, Sulkowicz had "insisted on it being completely real.&amp;nbsp;... That's what makes it a performance art piece."&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015/&gt; Sulkowicz told the ''Guardian'' that making the video had been traumatizing, and had left them in a "very scared, emotional state for days."&lt;ref name=Gambino9June2015/&gt; They said elsewhere that vulnerability is part of what makes performance art good.&lt;ref name=Sulkowicz4June2015/&gt;

===Text===
The introductory text said that the video was not an enactment of Sulkowicz's rape allegation. Rather, "''Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol''&amp;nbsp;... [is] about your decisions, starting now." Sulkowicz gives only provisional consent to view the video:&lt;ref name=Munro4June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alter5June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss9June2015/&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 5px #ccc;padding:1.2em"&gt;Do not watch this video if your motives would upset me, my desires are unclear to you, or my nuances are indecipherable.{{paragraph break}} You might be wondering why I've made myself this vulnerable. Look—I want to change the world, and that begins with you, seeing yourself. If you watch this video without my consent, then I hope you reflect on your reasons for objectifying me and participating in my rape, for, in that case, you were the one who couldn't resist the urge to make ''Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol'' about what you wanted to make it about: rape.{{paragraph break}} Please, don't participate in my rape. Watch kindly.&lt;ref name=Gambino5June2015&gt;Lauren Gambino, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/05/columbia-graduate-mattress-emma-sulkowicz-video/ "Columbia graduate who carried mattress releases video depicting 'rape'"], ''The Guargian'', 5 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They then ask a series of questions: "Are you searching for ways to either hurt or help me?&amp;nbsp;... Do you think I'm the perfect victim or the world's worst victim?&amp;nbsp;... Do you hate me? If so, how does it feel to hate me?"&lt;ref name=Gambino5June2015/&gt;

===Video===
The scene is shown on a split screen from four angles, with a [[timestamp]] in each corner, beginning 02:10 and ending 02:18. Lawson said the security-camera perspective "removes the wall between the viewer and the action."&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015&gt;Teo Armus, [http://columbiaspectator.com/news/2015/06/05/sulkowicz-films-herself-violent-sex-scene-newest-art-project "Sulkowicz films herself in a violent sex scene for newest art project"], ''Columbia Spectator'', 5 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gambino9June2015/&gt; The video begins with Sulkowicz and the actor, whose face is blurred, entering the room, undressing each other, then kissing and engaging in [[Oral sex|oral]] and [[vaginal sex]], the latter with a condom. Three minutes into the video, the actor hits Sulkowicz several times, then removes the condom, pushes his hands and their legs against their neck or throat, and penetrates them anally. They scream, tells him to stop, and put their hand over their face. After a short time, the actor stops abruptly and leaves the room with his clothes in his hands. Sulkowicz is left curled on the bed in the [[fetal position]], with their back to the camera. After wrapping themselves in a towel, they briefly leave the room, return and make their bed, then appears to fall asleep.&lt;ref name=Frank5June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015/&gt;

Lawson told the ''Columbia Spectator'' that Sulkowicz and the actor had captured the shift from the consensual to non-consensual: "I think the video expresses the possibility that you don't forfeit that [consensuality] ever."&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015/&gt;

===Public comments===
Lawson said ''Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol'' explores the relationship between art and social media, "this giant, polluted ocean."&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015/&gt; A key part of the work was the online reaction, particularly in the website's comments section. The 2,700 comments within the first five days were mostly critical or ridiculing. They included sexual, sexist and racist insults and threats. There were remarks about Sulkowicz's physical appearance, ethnicity, mental health, and that the scene did not depict rape.&lt;ref name=Rubin9June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Seltzer9June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss9June2015&gt;[[Suzannah Weiss]], [http://www.bustle.com/articles/88974-emma-sulkowiczs-ceci-nest-pas-un-viol-site-was-temporarily-disabled-by-cyberattacks-but-her-opponents "Emma Sulkowicz's 'Ceci N’est Pas Un Viol' Site Was Temporarily Disabled By Cyberattacks, But Her Opponents Are Missing The Point"], ''Bustle'', 9 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Monro9June2015&gt;[https://news.artnet.com/in-brief/hackers-disable-emma-sulkowicz-website-censor-new-artwork-306593 "Hackers Disable Emma Sulkowicz Website to Censor New Artwork"], ''ArtNet'', 9 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Chan, [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/anti-rape-activist-emma-sulkowicz-releases-sex-video-art-article-1.2247676 "Columbia University anti-rape activist Emma Sulkowicz releases sex video as newest art piece"], ''New York Daily News'', 6 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Someone posted the video on a porn site.&lt;ref name=Weiss9June2015/&gt; Comments on other sites were both positive and negative.&lt;ref name=Seltzer9June2015/&gt; The video was the victim of a denial-of-service attack by hackers on 4 June, according to [[DigitalOcean]], which hosts the site, and on 5 June there were technical problems caused by the numbers attempting to access it.&lt;ref name=Gambino9June2015/&gt;

==Analysis==
''Newsweek'' called the video a "harrowing document," while Priscilla Frank in ''The Huffington Post'' described it as "simple yet stinging, providing imagery that lingers like a nightmare, never quite comprehensible but impossible to forget."&lt;ref name=Frank5June2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Mejia, [http://www.newsweek.com/columbia-university-mattress-protester-releases-video-addressing-rape-340372 "Columbia University Mattress Protester Releases Video Addressing Rape"], ''Newsweek'', 6 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In the German edition of ''The Huffington Post'', Benjamin Prüfer was less positive, calling it an "art video that can only be described as pornography."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Prüfer, [http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2015/06/10/emma-sulkowicz-vergewalti_n_7558522.html "Kunst oder krank? Angebliches Vergewaltigungsopfer dreht verstörendes Sex-Video"]. ''The Huffington Post'', 11 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hannah Rubin, writing in ''The Forward'', called it "sophisticated and brilliant," and despaired of the lack of empathy on display in the website's comments section.&lt;ref name=Rubin9June2015/&gt; According to [[Julie Zeilinger]], the video was "unsettling" for Sulkowicz's supporters, and several questioned their approach.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Zeilinger, [http://mic.com/articles/120302/emma-sulkowicz-isn-t-the-only-artist-taking-on-sexual-assault-here-are-5-others "Emma Sulkowicz Isn't the Only Artist Taking on Sexual Assault. Here Are 5 Others"], 'Identities.Mic'', 8 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On ''Slate's'' DoubleX Gabfest podcast, [[Hanna Rosin]] argued that the split-screen forces the viewer to embrace the subjective, in terms of choosing whether and how to watch, and how to interpret, which is the opposite of activism because it is too nuanced. The broadcast noted that Sandra Leong, Sulkowicz's mother, had written on Facebook in support of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Rosin, Noreen Malone and June Thomas, [http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/doublex_gabfest/2015/06/doublex_gabfest_on_emma_sulkowicz_radical_feminism_versus_caitlyn_jenner.html "DoubleX Gabfest: The Triple X Edition"], ''Slate'', 11 June 2015, from c. 09:00 mins; c 18:00 for Sandra Leong.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suzannah Weiss]] wrote in ''[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]'' that Sulkowicz's provisional consent to watch the video is a metaphor for sexual consent. The video is there to watch, but the viewer has a decision to make. No one has consent to watch with hostility or if they are unsure of the artist's desires. No one has consent to post it to a porn site.&lt;ref name=Weiss9June2015/&gt; If the artist's terms are disregarded, the viewing is non-consensual. Rebecca Brink argued in ''[[The Frisky (website)|The Frisky]]'' that, as well as illustrating the nature of sexual consent, ''Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol'' challenges the position that art, once made public, is removed from the artist's control and is for the viewer alone to interpret.&lt;ref name=Brink5June2015&gt;Rebecca Brink, [http://www.thefrisky.com/2015-06-05/emma-sulkowiczs-ceci-nest-pas-un-viol-an-explainer "Emma Sulkowicz's “Ceci N’est Pas Un Viol”: An Explainer"], ''The Frisky'', 5 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
===Forschungsschwerpunkte===
Kemferts Forschungstätigkeit beschäftigt sich im Kern um die Bewertung von ökonomischen Effekten der Klima-, Energie- und Verkehrspolitik.
====Politische Nachhaltigkeitsstrategien und Maßnahmen====
Kemfert entwickelt am DIW wirtschaftstheoretisch fundierte, praktikable und umsetzbare Strategien für die Politik, zum Beispiel in Bezug auf
* [[Klimaschutzpolitik]], in der es darum geht, die im [[Kyoto-Protokoll]] definierten Mechanismen global weiterzuentwickeln und konsistent in europäische und nationale Strategien zu integrieren
* [[Emissionshandel]], der 2005 in Europa begonnen wurde und nun-mehr beispielsweise durch Regeln für die Allokation von Emissions-rechten effizienter gestaltet und ausgeweitet werden soll.
* umweltrelevante [[Steuergesetzgebung]], die innerhalb von Europa weiter harmonisiert werden soll (Harmonisierung der Energiesteuern, einheitliche Besteuerungen von Fahrzeugen u.ä.)
* Maßnahmen zur Förderung neuer Technologien (u.a. [[erneuerbare Energien]], [[Kraft-Wärme-Kopplung]], alternative Kraftstoffe sowie Kohlenstoff-Rückhaltung und -Speicherung).
* Wettbewerb im [[Energiemarkt]], der beispielsweise im Strom- und Gasbereich über [[Anreizregulierung]]en intensiviert und durch intelligente Nutzung vorhandener Infrastrukturen effizient geregelt werden soll.
* [[Verkehrspolitik]], die durch quantitative Kostenanalysen fundiert, technisch leicht umsetzbar und im Hinblick auf Akzeptanz und Verhaltensänderungen ausreichend transparent gestaltet sein muss (Straßennutzungsgebühren o.ä.).
====Empirische Marktanalysen====
In Marktanalysen, die sich methodisch auf empirische Erhebungen, [[Zeitreihenanalyse]]n und Partialmodelle stützen, erhebt Kemfert im DIW Daten und Informationen, zu verschiedenen Aspekten der globalen Energie- und Verkehrsmärkte.
Die Auswirkungen der europäischen Liberalisierung der Strom- und Gasmärkte beispielsweise wird von Kemferts Abteilung mit den partiellen [[Gleichgewichtsmodell]]en EMELIE und GASMOD untersucht, die spieltheoretisch fundiert sind. Ökonometrische Methoden (TL- und BC-Modelle) finden speziell bei der Schätzung von Grenzkosten der Verkehrsinfrastruktur Anwendung. Als Basis für empirische Analysen werden zudem regelmäßig energie- und verkehrswirtschaftliche Statistiken erstellt.
Die Ergebnisse dieser Analysen fließen in  [[Szenario|Zukunftsszenarien]] ein, die besonders die vorhandenen Innovationspotenziale und Investitionserfordernisse berücksichtigen. Fragen mit denen sich Kemfert beschäftigt sind u.a.:
Inwieweit werden die Energie- und Verkehrsmärkte sowie ihre Auswirkungen auf die Wirtschaft und Umwelt durch unterschiedliche globale, regionale und nationale Entwicklungen beeinflusst?
In welcher Weise lässt sich in Bezug auf fossile Energieträger (Öl, Braunkohle etc.) das Spannungsverhältnis von Angebot, das regional konzentriert ist und stark von strategisch agierenden Anbietern abhängt, und Nachfrage, die im wesentlichen vom Wachstum in Schwellenländern getrieben wird, fassen und steuern?

====Gesamtwirtschaftliche Wirkungsanalysen====
Bei ihrem Aufenthalt an der Universität Stanford 1997 hat Kemfert das integrierte Modell  [[Folgen der globalen Erwärmung|WIAGEM]] entwickelt, mit Hilfe dessen sich globale Langfristszenarien von [[Klimaschutzpolitik]] und  [[Klimaschaden|Klimaschäden]] beurteilen lassen. 2002 präsentierte sie eine weiterentwickelte Version, mit der sie heute zum Beispiel die wirtschaftlichen Schäden globaler Klimaänderungen beurteilen kann, die durch weltweite Emissionen von Treibhausgasen verursacht werden. Zugleich kann sie aber auch die möglichen ökonomischen Auswirkungen der Klimaschutzpolitik, die zur Verminderung solcher Schäden erforderlich sind, ermessen und beurteilen. Dafür werden zusätzlich allgemeine [[Gleichgewichtsmodell]]e (CGE) wie GTAP-E und SGM weiterentwickelt.

Kemferts Forschungsergebnisse gehen in die UN-Klimaberichte ([[Vierter Sachstandsbericht des IPCC]]) ein. Zudem werden Ihre Forschungsergebnisse regelmäßig im Rahmen des Stanford [[Energy Modelling Forums]] (EMF) veröffentlicht.

===Kooperationen===
Kemferts Abteilung am DIW unterhält Kooperationen mit zahlreichen Forschungseinrichtungen in Deutschland, dazu gehören z.B. das [[Fraunhofer-Institut]] für System- und Innovationsforschung ISI, das [[Öko-Institut]], das Institut für Technikfolgenabschätzung und Systemanalyse ITAS am [[Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe]] und die Forschungsgruppe Systemforschung und technologische Entwicklung STE am [[Forschungszentrum Jülich]] sowie das [[Potsdam-Institut für Klimafolgenforschung]] PIK.
Auf internationaler Ebene bestehen zahlreiche Kooperationen, insbesondere mit der [[Stanford University]] (EMF, John Weyant), der [[University of Maryland]] (Ron Sands), der [[University of New South Wales]] (Truong Tru-ong), [[The Brookings Institution]] (Robert Puentes), der [[FU Brüssel]] (Ali Bayar), der [[Universität Graz]] (Karl Steiniger) und der [[Universität Linz]] (Friedrich Schneider).
Zudem erfolgt eine Zusammenarbeit in zahlreichen Netzwerken im Rahmen von europäischen Forschungsprojekten. Beispielsweise bestehen enge Verbindungen mit dem französischen Nationalen Forschungsinstitut [[INRETS]] sowie dem Institute for Transport Studies ITS an der [[Universität Leeds]] (Chris A. Nash).

===Positionen===
Kemfert bewertet seit über zehn Jahren die volkswirtschaftlichen Kosten des [[Klimawandel]]s und des [[Klimaschutzes]]. Die volkswirtschaftlichen Schäden des Klimawandels können deutlich über den Kosten des Klimaschutzes liegen. Die Aufgabe der Politik bestehe laut Kemfert darin, zum einen eine globale [[Klimaschutzpolitik]] auf den Weg zu bringen und zum anderen sich besser an den Klimawandel anzupassen. Da der Klimawandel kaum noch aufzuhalten sei, müssen geeignete [[Anpassung]]sstrategien, wie ein verbesserter Deichbau, Küstenzonenmanagement und Hitzwarnsysteme entwickelt werden und zum Einsatz kommen. Klimaschutzinstrumente sollen nach Kemfert bezahlbar sein. Ein wirkungsvolles Instrument ist der [[Emissionsrechtehandel]], welcher 2005 in Europa eingeführt wurde. Kemfert plädiert jedoch seit der Einführung für eine Verbesserung des Systems: neben einer Versteigerung der Emissionsrechte sollen vor allem nicht die EU Staa-ten selbst die Emissionsminderungsziele definieren, diesen müssten laut Kemfert direkt von der EU vorgegeben werden.
Kemfert hat frühzeitig auf die volkswirtschaftlichen Gefahren der [[Oligopol]]isierung des Europäischen Strommarktes hingewiesen. Durch zu wenig Wettbewerb auf dem Europäischen Strommarkt schöpfen wenige Unternehmen [[Monopol]]renten ab.
Sie hat anhand ihrer Forschungsergebnisse zudem festgestellt, dass zu hohe Gaspreise eine mögliche Konsequenz eines [[Kartell|Gas-Anbieterkartells]] sein können und volkswirtschaftlich schädliche Konsequenzen haben. Außerdem führt die zunehmende Ölknappheit zu weiter steigenden Preisen, welche negative volkswirtschaftliche Konsequenzen nach sich ziehen.
Außerdem warnt sie seit Jahren vor der allzu großen Abhängigkeit von  [[fossile Energie|fossiler Energie]]: Sie sieht die Ressourcenknappheit und den Klimawandel als die größten Herausforderungen des 21. Jahrhunderts an. Kemfert sieht als Ausweg den Umbau des Energiesystems durch eine sichere, [[CO2]]-freie und bezahlbare Energieversorgung können Energieknappheit und Klimaschutz gleichermaßen erfüllt werden.

''''' Coons v. Geithner''''' is a lawsuit filed on August 12, 2010, by the [[Goldwater Institute]] as a [[constitutional challenges to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|constitutional challenge to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] legislation passed in March 2010. The lawsuit was dismissed on December 19, 2012.

==Background of the case==
The suit aimed to prevent the bill from taking effect, and named as defendants four high-ranking officials within the federal government: President [[Barack Obama]], then-[[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Timothy Geithner]], [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] [[Kathleen Sebelius]], and [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]]. The Goldwater Institute’s Scharf-Norton Center for Constitutional Litigation represented [[Tempe, Arizona]], resident Nick Coons, thirty [[Arizona]] state lawmakers, and three then-[[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] from Arizona, [[Jeff Flake]] (now a Senator), [[Trent Franks]], and [[John Shadegg]] (since retired). In justifying the need for such a lawsuit, the Goldwater Institute argued that the PPACA represents an expansion of federal power in medicine, the likes of which has not taken place since the creation of [[Medicaid]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].&lt;ref name= GI-coons&gt;{{ cite web |url= http://www.goldwaterinstitute.org/article/coons-v-geithner-federal-health-care-lawsuit |title= Coons v. Geithner (federal health care lawsuit) |publisher= [[Goldwater Institute]] |accessdate= 8 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Goldwater Institute believed that this lawsuit distinguished itself from others filed across the country in that it united the most effective arguments from lawsuits already filed by the states of [[Virginia]] and [[Florida]] with further claims. According to the Goldwater Institute, these additional claims were "based on the [[separation of powers]], the right to medical autonomy and privacy, and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]." The suit claimed that the lead plaintiff, Nick Coons of Tempe, would have his right to [[medical privacy]] violated by the legislation. The legislation would compel Coons to disclose medical records that could be accessed by the federal government without Coons's approval.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktar.com/?nid=6&amp;sid=1324057 "New lawsuit challenges health care reform"], News 92.3 [[KTAR-FM|KTAR]], August 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, in 2014, Coons would face fines if he did not purchase a federally approved health care plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38665680 "Goldwater Institute files lawsuit against Obamacare"], ''[[East Valley Tribune]]'', August 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

One specific target of the lawsuit was the [[Independent Payment Advisory Board]], which is a new agency created by the health care bill. According to the Goldwater Institute, the board "will be able to dictate how much doctors can charge for medical care, how insurance companies will pay for it, and when patients can get access to cutting-edge treatments."&lt;ref name= GI-coons /&gt; Because these decisions cannot be reviewed by Congress nor the courts, the lawsuit claimed that the separation of powers doctrine is violated as a result of the health care legislation.

In addition, thirty Arizona lawmakers joined the suit because they believed the bill violates their First Amendment rights to cast votes for the benefit of their constituents. For example, in 2010, the Arizona Legislature sought to reduce the state's budget deficits by voting to reduce state funding for Medicaid. However, after the federal health care bill was passed, the Legislature had to restore all state funding for Medicaid or Arizona would have lost $7 billion in federal funding.&lt;ref name= GI-coons /&gt;

==Disposition of the case==
By an opinion (No. 13-15324) issued on August 7, 2014, retitled as ''Coons v. Lew'' (Jacob Lew having replaced Timothy Geithner as Secretary of the Treasury), the 9th Circuit affirmed the bulk of the judgment, but vacated in part and remanded to the District Court with instructions to dismiss one count for lack of jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graber|first1=Susan|title=Coons v.

The '''East Turkestan Liberation Organization''' ('''ETLO'''; {{lang-tr|Doğu Türkistan Kurtuluş Örgütü|East Turkistan Islamic Movement}}; {{lang-ug|شارقىي تۇركەستان ئازاتلىق تەشكىلاتى, ''Шәрқий Түркестан Азатлиқ Тешкилати''|Şärqiy Türkestan Azatliq Teşkilati; STAT}}) was a [[secessionist]] [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] organization that advocated for an independent Uyghur state named [[East Turkestan]] in the [[Western China|Western Chinese]] province known as [[Xinjiang]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/15/asia/AS-GEN-Kyrgyzstan-Extremism.php Kyrgyz authorities arrest fugitive Uighur separatist], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219061205/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/15/asia/AS-GEN-Kyrgyzstan-Extremism.php |date=2007-02-19 }} International Herald Tribune, February 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was established in [[Turkey]] in 1990 or 1996 to fight against the Chinese government in Xinjiang, a territory in which no ethnicity forms a majority, but is inhabited in order of most populous to least by Uyghur, Han Chinese, Kazakh and other Turkic communities.&lt;ref name="web.amnesty.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa17/021/2004/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-02 |df= }} People’s Republic of China Uighurs fleeing persecution as China wages its "war on terror," Amnesty International&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xinjiang]] or [[East Turkestan]] has a population of 18 million, eight million of which are Turkic-speaking Muslim [[Uyghur people|Uighurs]].

==History==
[[Amnesty International]] reports that "The Chinese government’s use of the term "separatism" refers to a broad range of activities, many of which amount to no more than peaceful opposition or dissent. Over the last three years, tens of thousands of people are reported to have been detained for investigation in the region and hundreds, possibly thousands, have been charged or sentenced under the Criminal Law; many Uighurs are believed to have been sentenced to death and executed for alleged "separatist" or "terrorist" offences, although the exact number is impossible to determine."&lt;ref name="web.amnesty.org"/&gt;

In 1998, ETLO members were accused by the government of China of organizing 15 [[arson]] incidents in [[Ürümqi]], and in 1999, [[Istanbul]] police arrested 10 ETLO members for a series of attacks on Chinese people in [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="vows"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=3703&amp;t=1|title=Separatist Leader Vows to Target Chinese Government|publisher=[[Radio Free Asia]]|date=2003-01-29|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[9/11]], 2001, China has effectively used the international climate to build an international coalition against Uyghur separatist movements.&lt;ref&gt;http://hrichina.org/public/contents/8784{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Nicolas Becquelin, Criminalizing Ethnicity: Political Repression in Xinjiang, China Rights Forum, 2004, No:1&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December 2003, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security issued a list of East Turkestan terrorists and terrorist organizations which named four organizations and several individuals: the East Turkestan Liberation Organization (ETLO), the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), the World Uyghur Youth Congress (WUYC) and the East Turkestan Information Centre (ETIC).&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;http://hrw.org/reports/2005/china0405/4.htm#_Toc100128615 Devastating Blows Religious Repression of Uighurs in Xinjiang, Human Right Watch&lt;/ref&gt; Many analysts{{who|date=October 2014}} claim that Russian and Chinese authorities [[exaggerate]] the potency of the Uyghur groups to justify their repressive counter-terror policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/etlo.htm|title=East Turkistan Liberation Organization (ETLO)|first=John|last=Pike|website=www.globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 Chinese documentary, "On the Spot Report: The Crimes of Eastern Turkestan Terrorist Power," Wang Mingshan, Deputy Director-General of the Yili-Kazak Autonomous Prefecture Public Security Department, claimed that in 1998 Mehmet Emin Hazret, the leader of the ETLO, ordered Hamid Mehmetjan, an [[Egypt]]ian ETLO member, to go to China to recruit members, receive a delivery of weapons on 6 April, and to compile a list of targets for assassination and bombings in Xinjiang. Mingshan also claimed that police and ETLO members exchanged gunfire on 24 April 1998, and that members later stated during interrogation that they were trained at [[Terror camp|camps]] in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=shichor&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/docs/CEF/Quarterly/May_2006/Shichor.pdf |title=Fact and Fiction: A Chinese Documentary on Eastern Turkestan Terrorism |first=Yitzhak |last=Shichor |journal=China and Eurasia Forum Quarterly |volume=4 |issue=2 |publisher=Central Asia-Caucasus Institute &amp; Silk Road Studies Program |date=May 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=September 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928083755/http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/docs/CEF/Quarterly/May_2006/Shichor.pdf |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2003, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security issued a list of East Turkestan terrorists and terrorist organizations which named four organizations and several individuals: the East Turkestan Liberation Organization (ETLO), the [[East Turkestan Islamic Movement]] (ETIM), the [[World Uyghur Congress|World Uyghur Youth Congress]] (WUYC) and the East Turkestan Information Centre (ETIC).&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt;
At the same time, the official Chinese press initiated a campaign detailing terrorist incidents allegedly carried out by the individuals listed. [[Amnesty International]] regarded these allegations "uncorroborated and no credible evidence was provided to substantiate these claims. Indeed, much of the "evidence" appeared to have been obtained from other individuals under interrogation. In view of the ongoing and widespread use of torture and ill-treatment by police in China, particularly to extract confessions from detained suspects, Amnesty International believes any "evidence" obtained in this way must be treated with deep suspicion." &lt;ref name="web.amnesty.org"/&gt; In January, Hazret, who avoids public appearances, called into [[Radio Free Asia]] to respond that ETLO wishes to work by peaceful means, but spoke of the "inevitability" of a military wing targeting the Chinese government.&lt;ref name="vows"/&gt; He also stated that the principal goal of the ETLO was to pursue independence through peaceful means,&lt;ref name="flashpoints"/&gt;&lt;ref name="in-2003"&gt;

According to Amnesty International, "the listing of ETIM and ETLO was in keeping with previous allegations made by China against these groups. Both were highlighted in China’s official report on East Turkestan terrorists of January 2002 and China’s allegations against ETIM (East Turkestan Islamic Movement) were bolstered in August 2002 when the US, closely followed by the UN formally classified ETIM as a "terrorist organization" after several requests from China.&lt;ref name="web.amnesty.org"/&gt; The American government refused China's request to recognize the East Turkestan Liberation Organization (ETLO) as a terrorist organization in December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/china0405/4.htm Devastating Blows Religious Repression of Uighurs in Xinjiang, Human Right Watch&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Europeana.eu''' is the EU digital platform for cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/new-europeana-collections-site-brings-people-closer-culture|title=New Europeana Collections site brings people closer to culture|date=22 January 2016|website=Digital Single Market|publisher=[[European Commission]]|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], ''[[Girl With a Pearl Earring|Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]], the works of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Isaac Newton]] and the music of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] are some of the highlights on Europeana.

More than 3,000 institutions across Europe have contributed to Europeana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why become a data provider?|url=http://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/become-a-data-provider|website=pro.europeana|publisher=Europeana|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These range from major international names like the [[Rijksmuseum|Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam]], the [[British Library]] and the [[Louvre]] to regional archives and local museums from every member of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;List of partners and contributors [http://europeana.eu/portal/partners.html List of partners and contributors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423034227/http://europeana.eu/portal/partners.html |date=23 April 2011 }}, Europeana.eu. Accessed 2 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Together, their assembled collections let users explore Europe's cultural and scientific heritage from prehistory to the modern day.

== History ==
The catalyst for Europeana was a letter sent by [[Jacques Chirac]], President of France, together with the premiers of [[Germany]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]] to the President of the European Commission, [[Jose Manuel Durao Barroso|José Manuel Durão Barroso]], in April 2005. The letter recommended the creation of a virtual European library, to make Europe's cultural heritage accessible for all.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/timeline-digitisation-and-online-accessibility-cultural-heritage Timeline of digitisation and online accessibility of cultural heritage]" (23 July 2014). European Commission, ''Digital Agenda for Europe''. The letter, written in French, was dated 28 April 2005 (see under that date in timeline): [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=5978 ec.europa.eu]. Retrieved 2015-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter added resonance to the work that the [[European Commission]]'s [[Directorate-General for Information Society and Media (European Commission)|Information Society and Media Directorate]] had been engaged in for over a decade, with programmes such as Telematics for Libraries. It gave strong political endorsement to the Directorate's strategy, i2010: communication on digital libraries, which was published on 30 September 2005. The strategy announced the intention to promote and support the creation of a European [[digital library]], as a goal within the European Union,&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (30 September 2005). Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. ''[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52005DC0465&amp;from=EN i2010: Digital Libraries]''  p. 3. Retrieved 2015-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to foster growth in the information society and media industries.

The project that began the building of Europeana was called the European Digital Library Network (EDLnet) and was aimed at building a prototype of a cross-border, cross-domain, user-centred service. It was funded by the European Commission under its eContentplus programme, one of the research and development funding streams of i2010.

The prototype was launched on 20 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/aboutus_background.html |title=Background |publisher=Europeana.eu |accessdate= 10 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122000251/http://www.europeana.eu/portal/aboutus_background.html |archivedate=January 22, 2011 |quote=2008 Europeana's prototype is launched on November 20th by Viviane Reding, European Commissioner for Information Society and Media, and the President of the Commission, José Manuel Barroso.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its beta launch, the site gave access to 4.5 million digital objects – more than double the initial target – from over 1,000 contributing organisations, including world-famous national library, gallery and museum collections from the capitals of Europe. Due to an unexpected user surge (peaking at an estimated 10 million hits an hour), the servers were unable to cope with the massive load. The site was temporarily taken down, and after series of technical upgrades went up again in December 2008.
In February 2009, the successor of EDLnet – Europeana version 1.0 – began. This 30-month project was to develop the prototype into a fully operational service. In 2010, the project accomplished its objective of giving access to over 10 million digital objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-v1.0 |title=Europeana Version 1 project |publisher=Europeana Foundation |date= |accessdate=2012-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710051622/http://www.pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-v1.0 |archivedate=10 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 2011, new features on the site included a translation tool and the ability to expand on information by automatically transferring the search term to Wikipedia and other services.

== Function ==
Europeana gives access to different types of content from different types of heritage institutions. The digital objects that users can find in Europeana are not stored on a central computer, but remain with the cultural institution and are hosted on their networks. Europeana collects contextual information – or [[metadata]] – about the items, including a small picture. Users search this contextual information. Once they find what they are looking for, if they want to access the full content of the item, they can click through to the original site that holds the content.

Different types of cultural heritage organisations – libraries, museums, archives and audiovisual collections – catalogue their content in different ways and to different standards. Approaches also vary in different countries. To make the information searchable, it has to be mapped to a single common standard, known as the Europeana Semantic Elements. This metadata standard at present takes a lowest common denominator approach to the integration of different types of digital content. In 2010 the ''Europeana Data Model'', a richer metadata standard, was introduced to help give users more and better information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europeana Data Model Documentation|url=http://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation|website=pro.europeana|publisher=Europeana|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europeana accepts metadata about digital objects, it does not make any decisions about digitisation. The decision about which objects are digitised lies with the organisation that holds the material.

== Strategy ==
In its Strategic Plan for 2011–2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://version1.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=c4f19464-7504-44db-ac1e-3ddb78c922d7&amp;groupId=10602 |title=Strategic Plan 2011–2015 |publisher=Europeana.eu |accessdate=10 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121132654/http://version1.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=c4f19464-7504-44db-ac1e-3ddb78c922d7&amp;groupId=10602 |archivedate=21 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was published in January 2011, Europeana outlines four strategic tracks that will shape its further development:
# Aggregate – to build the open trusted source for European cultural and scientific heritage content;
# Facilitate – to support the cultural and scientific heritage sector through knowledge transfer, innovation and advocacy;
# Distribute – to make heritage available to users wherever they are, whenever they want it;
# Engage – to cultivate new ways for users to participate in their cultural and scientific heritage.

The current strategy is for the period 2015-2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europeana Strategy 2015-2020|url=http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/|website=strategy2020.europeana.eu|publisher=Europeana|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
The Europeana Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pro.europeana.eu/foundation |title=The Europeana Foundation |publisher= Pro.europeana.eu |accessdate= 25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the governing body of the Europeana service. Its members are the presidents and chairs of European associations for cultural heritage and information associations.

The Foundation promotes collaboration between museums, archives, audiovisual collections and libraries so that users can have integrated access to their content through Europeana and other services.

The Foundation is incorporated under Dutch law as '''Stichting Europeana'''&lt;ref&gt;Stichting Europeana, [[Kamer van Koophandel|Kamer van Koophandel (Chamber of Commerce, Netherlands)]] (KvK) number 27307531, located at Prins Willem-Alexanderhof 5, 's-Gravenhage (The Hague).&lt;/ref&gt; and is housed within the [[Koninklijke Bibliotheek, National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]], the national library of the Netherlands. It provides a legal framework for the governance of Europeana, employing the staff, bidding for funding and enabling the sustainability of the service.

The executive director of the Europeana Foundation is Harry Verwayen.

== Europeana projects ==
There are a number of projects – the Europeana Group – that are contributing technology solutions and content to Europeana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://group.europeana.eu |title=Europeana Group |accessdate= 10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These projects are run by different cultural heritage institutions, and are part-funded by the [[European Commission]]'s [[EContentplus|eContentplus programme]] and the Information and Communications Technologies Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP).

== Financing ==
Europeana and the projects contributing content to Europeana.eu have been funded by the European Commission under [[eContentplus]], the Information and Communications Technologies Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP) and similar programmes. To participate in a wide range of projects, which are only funded by the Commission for 50–100% of the costs and do not include overheads, Europeana is also reliant for an element of its funding on Member States’ ministries of culture and education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2926">'''Finnish Organization of Canada''' (FOC, {{lang-fi|Kanadan Suomalainen Järjestö}}) is a [[Finnish Canadian]] cultural organization. It was established in 1911 as the '''Finnish Socialist Organization of Canada''' (''Kanadan Suomalainen Sosialistinen Järjestö''). FOC is the oldest nationwide cultural organization for Finns in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/finns/ Finns] Historica Canada. Retrieved 10 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first connected with [[Social Democratic Party of Canada]] and later with [[Communist Party of Canada]]. Today FOC is no longer associated with politics. It has fewer than 200 members, who are mostly senior citizens in the areas of [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], [[Sudbury, Ontario|Sudbury]] and [[Thunder Bay, Ontario|Thunder Bay]].&lt;ref name=magocsi&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dbUuX0mnvQMC&amp;pg=PA521 Paul R. Magocsi: "Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples", p. 519–521.] Retrieved 10 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Finnish Organization of Canada was established in October 1911 by Finnish socialists who were expelled from the [[Socialist Party of Canada]]. A key person in its founding was the Finnish-Canadian agitator and feminist [[Sanna Kannasto]]. By the end of 1911 FOC had 19 locals and more than 1,500 members. Three years later the member count was more than 3,000 with 64 locals across the country. Five hundred of the members were women. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the organization came into almost continuous conflict with liberal, social-democratic, and conservative factions both within and without the Finnish community in Canada, evidenced by the rumours of "reception committees" active in communities around Sudbury where newly immigrated Finns would be vetted by local committees which would separate them into "Reds" or "[[White Finn|Whites]]", with identified Reds being approved to settle and Whites encouraged to move elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Between a Rock and a Hard Place |last=Saarinen |first=Oiva W. |date=September 1999 |publisher=[[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]] |isbn=978-0-88920-320-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 the [[social democrats]] left the FOC and organization was fully related with communists. It was banned in 1940 due to the [[Defence of Canada Regulations]] but declared legal again in 1943 as Canada had become an ally with [[Soviet Union]] in 1941.&lt;ref name=magocsi/&gt;

FOC published the Finnish-language newspaper ''[[Vapaus]]'' in Sudbury from 1917 to 1974. The previous newspaper ''Työkansa'' had gone bankrupt in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multiculturalcanada.ca/vapaus2500 Vapaus] Multicultural Canada. Retrieved 10 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''first Catilinarian conspiracy''' was a plot to murder the [[Roman consul|consuls]] of 65 BC and seize power. Historians consider it unlikely that [[Catiline]] would have been involved in the first Catilinarian conspiracy or, indeed, that the conspiracy existed at all.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

==History==
[[File:Comic History of Rome Table 10 Cicero denouncing Catiline.jpg|thumb|300px|Comic depiction of Cicero denouncing Catiline. (Note [[anachronism]]s, such as [[top hat]]s and other [[Victorian fashion|Victorian clothing]].)]]
In all likelihood, [[Catiline]] was not involved in the so-called first Catilinarian conspiracy, although several historical sources implicate him in it. There does not seem to be a single account that is represented in all of the sources: rather, it seems that the accounts represent a collection of rumors accusing different political figures in attempts to tarnish their names. As it pertains to Catiline, much of the information originates in [[Cicero]]’s speech ''[[In Toga Candida]]'' which was given during his election campaign in 64 BC. Only fragments of this speech still exist, in the later writing of [[Asconius Pedianus]].{{cn|date=November 2016}}

The [[Roman consul|consuls-designate]], [[Publius Autronius Paetus]] and [[Publius Cornelius Sulla]], were prevented from entering office because of ''[[ambitus]]'', electoral corruption, under the ''[[Lex Acilia Calpurnia]]''.&lt;ref name="cic_sulla_49"&gt;Cicero, ''Pro Sulla'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Cic.+Sul.+49&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0015 XLIX]; Sallust, ''Bellum Catilinae'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Sal.+Cat.+18.2&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0123 XVIII.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the two other leading candidates, [[Lucius Manlius Torquatus]] and [[Lucius Aurelius Cotta (consul 65 BC)|Lucius Aurelius Cotta]], were elected in a second election and were to enter office on January 1, 65 BC. Supposedly, Catiline, incensed because he was not allowed to stand for the consulship, conspired with [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso (Catilinian conspirator)|Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]] and the former consuls-designate to slaughter many of the senators and the new consuls the day they assumed office. Then they would name themselves the consuls for the year and then Piso would have been sent to organize the provinces in [[Hispania]].&lt;ref name="sall_18.5"&gt;Sallust, ''Bellum Catilinae'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0123:section=18 XVIII.5]; Asconius 92C; Dio Cassius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/36*.html#44.3 XXXVI.44.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, [[Suetonius]] claims that [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] directed the conspiracy, but he fails to mention Catiline's involvement.  Instead of assuming the consulship, Crassus is accused of planning to become [[Roman Dictator|dictator]] and intending to name Caesar ''[[magister equitum]]''.&lt;ref name="sue_9"&gt;Suetonius, ''Divus Julius'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Suet.+Jul.+9&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0061 IX]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 62 BC, after Catiline's death, Cicero defended Publius Sulla in court after he was indicted for being a member of the second conspiracy. In order to free his client of implication in the first Catilinarian conspiracy, he places the blame solely on Catiline who, conveniently, had waged war against the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] in the previous months.&lt;ref name="cic_sulla_68"&gt;Cicero, ''Pro Sulla'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0015:text=Sul.:section=68 LXVIII]&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Publius Sulla was acquitted, Catiline's name was further tarnished, and Cicero received a large loan to purchase a home.&lt;ref name="gellius_12.12.2-4"&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'' XII.12.2-4&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear who participated in this alleged conspiracy, as the different accounts accuse different people, but Catiline's association with it appears to have been developed after the [[Second Catilinarian Conspiracy]]. Cicero's accusations prior to 63 BC are likely unfounded, since Rome had no penalty for libel. Furthermore, Catiline had little motive to participate in this conspiracy, especially since he had been denied very little. He still held the aspiration of obtaining the consulship legitimately the next year, and the conspiracy involved the murder of the consul, Manlius Torquatus, who supported Catiline.

'''Galiza Ceibe-OLN''' (in [[English language|English]]: ''Liberated&lt;ref&gt;Ceibe can be translated also as free.&lt;/ref&gt; Galiza-National Liberation Organization'') was an independentist and socialist [[political party]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Spain]]. Galiza Ceibe was founded on 1980 by the [[Galician Party of the Proletariat]] (''Partido Galego do Proletariado, PGP'') as a political and electoral front, originally to present a list in [[Vigo]] and in other galician municipalities under the name Agrupación Electoral Galicia Ceibe in the 1979 local elections.&lt;ref&gt;The PGP also supported some [[Galician Unity]] lists, obtaining 3 town councillors (1 in [[Santiago de Compostela]], 1 in [[Monforte de Lemos]] and 1 in [[Vilaboa]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Foundation and dissolution of the PGP===
The list gained 1,926 votes (2.22%) and no seats in [[Vigo]] and 2 town councillors in [[Salvaterra de Miño]].&lt;ref&gt;Galiza Ceibe also presented lists in [[Muros, A Coruña]], [[As Pontes de García Rodríguez]], [[O Barco de Valdeorras]], [[Santiago de Compostela]], [[A Coruña]] and [[Ourense]] without success. http://www.novasgz.com/pdf/ngz103.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 the PGP transformed Galiza Ceibe-OLN in a political party. In 1981 the PGP dissolved itself, and its militants joined Galiza Ceibe. [[Espiral]] was the party newspaper. The same year 16 Galician nationalists were arrested by police charged with ''membership of an armed band''. Among the arrested there were several members of Galiza Ceibe. The arrests led to protests and riots, with the participation of the [[Galician People's Union]] and the [[Asemblea Nacional-Popular Galega|AN-PG]]. All the detainees were released between 1981 and 1983.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.primeiralinha.org/paraumhagzindependente/foz2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Galician autonomy referendum, 1980|1980 autonomy referendum]] Galiza Ceibe supported both abstention and negative vote.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.primeiralinha.org/paraumhagzindependente/foz2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alliances and electoral participation===
In the [[Galician parliamentary election, 1981|autonomic elections of 1981]] Galiza Ceibe and the PGP presented a candidacy to use the public media. The electoral campaign was used to support and raise awareness about the independentist prisoners and to call for abstention. At the end of the campaign the party announced its withdrawal from the elections.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.primeiralinha.org/paraumhagzindependente/foz2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the withdrawal and their calls for abstention, Galicia Ceibe gained 1,433 (0.15%) votes. The same year the organization called for a demonstration in [[Santiago de Compostela]] in the [[Día Nacional de Galicia|National Day of Galicia]] under the slogan ''Independencia e Socialismo'' (Independence and Socialism).

In 1982 he was one of the forces that founded the [[Bloque Nacionalista Galego|BNG]] but left the organization in the Constituent Assembly when the majority decided to participate in the general and autonomic elections.

In the [[Spanish municipal elections, 1983|elections of 1983]] formed with the [[Spanish Communist Workers' Party|PCOE]] and independents the [[Popular Unity Candidates (Galicia)|Popular Unity Candidates]] (''Candidaturas de Unidade Popular''), that presented lists in [[Vigo]] and [[Pontevedra]].&lt;ref&gt;Only 814 votes in [[Vigo]] and 182 in [[Pontevedra]]&lt;/ref&gt; The party also supported and participated in the Unidade dos Viciños list in [[Melide, A Coruña|Melide]], that gained 4 town councillors and the 26,71% of the vote (1,073 votes); and supported, but not participated, the Unión Galega list in Cambados (that gained 11 town councillors and the mayor) and the [[Agrupación Nacionalista Galega de Narón]] in [[Narón]] (6 town councillors and the mayor). Due to the poor results achieved [[Xosé Luís Méndez Ferrín]] proposed later this year in the VI National Assembly the dissolution of the organization, which was rejected by the majority. After that assembly part of the militancy left the organization. The National Assembly also decided to rename the organization as Galiza Ceive-OLN and adopt [[reintegrationism]]. [[Antom Árias Curto]]&lt;ref&gt;Town councillor in [[Monforte de Lemos]] between 1979 and 1980, when he was arrested by the police and accused of terrorism.&lt;/ref&gt; became the most prominent leader. The organization gave ideological and political support to the [[Exército Guerrilheiro do Povo Galego Ceive]] (EGPGC, Guerrilla Army of the Free Galician People).

Galiza Ceibe called for abstention in the [[Galician parliamentary election, 1985|1985 autonomic elections]], criticizing the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc|BNG]] for taking the oath of the Spanish constitution.&lt;ref&gt;RIOS BERGANTINHOS, Noa. A esquerda independentista galega (1977-1995). Abrente Editora, Santiago de Compostela, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissolution===
In 1988, along with the [[Communist Party of National Liberation]] and local groups,&lt;ref&gt;Colectivos Nacionalistas from [[Narón]] and [[Vigo]], [[Grupos Independentistas Galegos]] from [[Santiago de Compostela]] and the [[Iskeiro Collective]], from [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]]&lt;/ref&gt; formed the [[Galician People's Front]]. The following year Galiza-Ceive OLN decided to leave the organization because of the political differences in the organization's strategy (specially on the support of the [[EGPGC]] [[armed struggle]], that Galiza Ceive supported but not the [[Communist Party of National Liberation|PCLN]]), and dissolved itself to form the [[Assembleia do Povo Unido]].

'''Holistic management''' (from {{lang|grc|ὅλος}} ''holos'', a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning ''all'', ''whole'', ''entire'', ''total'') in agriculture is a [[systems thinking]] approach to managing resources that was originally developed by [[Allan Savory]] for reversing [[desertification]].&lt;ref name="greenbiz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coughlin|first=Chrissy|title=Allan Savory: How livestock can protect the land|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2013/03/10/allan-savory-how-livestock-can-protect-land|publisher=GreenBiz|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the Africa Centre for Holistic Management in Zimbabwe, Operation Hope (a "[[proof of concept]]" project using holistic management) was named the winner of the 2010 [[Buckminster Fuller Challenge]] for "recognizing initiatives which take a comprehensive, anticipatory, design approach to radically advance human well being and the health of our planet's ecosystems".&lt;ref name="challenge"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Challenge Winner: Operation Hope: Permanent water and food security for Africa's impoverished millions|url=http://challenge.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2010/operation-hope|publisher=bfi.org|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thackara|first=John|title=Greener Pastures|url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/Greener_Pastures/|publisher=Seed Magazine|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothstein|first=Joe|title=Hang On, Planet Earth, Help Is On The Way|url=http://uspolitics.einnews.com/column/57081276/hang-on-planet-earth-help-is-on-the-way-joe-rothstein-s-commentary|publisher=EIN News|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beginnings ==
The idea of holistic planned [[grazing]] began in the 1960s when [[Allan Savory]], a wildlife biologist in his native [[Southern Rhodesia]], set out to understand [[desertification]]. This can be seen in the context of the larger [[environmental movement]]. Heavily influenced by the work of [[André Voisin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Voisin|first= André |authorlink= |title=Grass Productivity | date=1 December 1988 |origyear=1959 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-0933280649 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Voisin|first=André, Antoine Lecomte|title=Rational grazing, the meeting of cow and grass: a manual of grass productivity|year=1962|publisher=C. Lockwood LTD, London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ineffectiveness of mainstream [[rangeland]] science of the time, Savory concluded that the spread of deserts, the loss of wildlife, and the human impoverishment that always resulted were related to the reduction of the natural [[herds]] of large grazers and even more, the change in behavior of those few remaining herds.&lt;ref name="greenbiz" /&gt; [[Livestock]] could be substituted to provide important [[ecosystem services]] like nutrient [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycling]] when [[Biomimicry|mimicking]]&lt;ref name="Benyus 1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Benyus |first=Janine |title=Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature |year=1997 |publisher=[[William Morrow &amp; Company]], Inc. |location=New York, NY, USA |isbn=978-0-688-16099-9 |ref=Benyus97}}&lt;/ref&gt; those uniquely coevolved grasses and grazers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Retallack|first=Gregory|title=Cenozoic Expansion of Grasslands and Climatic Cooling|url=http://blogs.uoregon.edu/gregr/files/2013/07/grasslandscooling-nhslkh.pdf|work=The University of Chicago|publisher=The Journal of Geology|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Voisin|first= André |authorlink= |title=Grass Productivity | date=1 December 1988 |origyear=1959 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-0933280649 |page=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Undersander|first=Dan|title=Pastures for profit: A guide to rotational grazing|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/A3529.pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin Extension|accessdate=5 April 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; But managers had found that while [[rotational grazing]] systems can work for diverse management purposes, scientific experiments had demonstrated that they do not necessarily work for specific [[ecological]] purposes. An adaptive management plan was needed for the integration of the [[experience|experiential]] with the [[experimental]], as well as the [[social]] with the [[biophysical]], to provide a more comprehensive framework for the management of rangeland systems.&lt;ref&gt;D. D. Briske, Nathan F. Sayre, L. Huntsinger, M. Fernandez-Gimenez, B. Budd, and J. D. Derner, Origin, Persistence, and Resolution of the Rotational Grazing Debate: Integrating Human Dimensions Into Rangeland Research, Rangeland Ecology &amp; Management 2011 64:4, 325-334&lt;/ref&gt; None of these sources of knowledge could be understood except in the context of the whole. [[holism|Holistic]] management was developed to meet that need.

== Development ==
In many regions, [[pastoralism]] and communal land use are blamed for [[human ecology|environmental]] degradation caused by [[overgrazing]]. After years of research and experience, Savory came to understand this assertion was often wrong, and that sometimes removing animals actually made it worse.&lt;ref name="challenge" /&gt; This concept is a variation of the [[trophic cascade]], where humans are seen as the top level predator and the cascade follows from there.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I have been particularly fascinated, for example, by the work of a remarkable man called Allan Savory, in Zimbabwe and other [[semi arid]] areas, who has argued for years against the prevailing expert view that is the simple numbers of cattle that drive overgrazing and cause fertile land to become desert. On the contrary, as he has since shown so graphically, the land needs the presence of feeding animals and their droppings for the cycle to be complete, so that soils and grassland areas stay productive. Such that, if you take grazers off the land and lock them away in vast [[feedlots]], the land dies. "- His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales ([[Prince Charles]]) from a speech to the IUCN World Conservation Congress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Charles sends a message to IUCN's World Conservation Congress |url=http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774/Prince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress |work=International Union for Conservation of Nature |accessdate=6 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315111928/http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774%2FPrince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress |archivedate=15 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Savory developed a flexible management system designed to improve grazing systems. Holistic planned grazing is one of a number of newer grazing management systems that more closely simulate the behavior of natural herds of wildlife and have been shown to improve [[riparian]] habitats and water quality over systems that often led to [[land degradation]], and be an effective tool to improve range condition for both livestock and [[wildlife]].&lt;ref name="challenge" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dagget|first=Dan ; with photography by Tom Bean|title=Gardeners of Eden : rediscovering our importance to nature|year=2005|publisher=Thatcher Charitable Trust|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=9780966622911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weber|first1=K T|last2=Gokhale|first2=B S|title=Effect of grazing on soil-water content in semiarid rangelands of southeast Idaho|url=http://giscenter.isu.edu/research/projects/jae_soilmoisture.pdf|website=Elsevier|publisher=Journal of Arid Environments|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwartz|first=Judith D.|title=Greener Pastures|url=http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2011/06/greener-pastures/|work=Conservation Magazine|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salatin|first=Joel|title=Tall grass mob stocking|url=http://www.acresusa.com/toolbox/reprints/May08_Salatin.pdf|work=Acres USA May 2008 vol 8 no 5|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111035028/http://www.acresusa.com/toolbox/reprints/May08_Salatin.pdf|archivedate=11 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

== Framework ==
The holistic management decision-making framework uses six key steps to guide the management of resources:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Putting Holistic Management In Place|url=http://www.savoryinstitute.com/holistic-management/works/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111074423/http://www.savoryinstitute.com/holistic-management/works/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 January 2012|work=Savory Institute|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Preston|title=Holistic Management: A Whole-Farm Decision Making Framework|url=https://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/summaries/summary.php?pub=296|work=The National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service - ATTRA|publisher=National Center for Appropriate Technology (NCAT)|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Define in its entirety what you are managing. No area should be treated as a single-product system. By defining the whole, people are better able to manage. This includes identifying the available resources, including [[money management|money]], that the manager has at his disposal.
#Define what you want now and for the future. Set the objectives, goals and actions needed to produce the [[quality of life]] sought, and what the [[Mother nature|life-nurturing environment]] must be like to sustain that quality of life far into the future.
#Watch for the earliest indicators of ecosystem health. Identify the ecosystem services that have deep impacts for people in both urban and rural environments, and find a way to easily monitor them. One of the best examples of an early indicator of a poorly functioning environment is patches of bare ground. An indicator of a better functioning environment is newly sprouting diversity of plants and a return or increase of wildlife.
#Don't limit the management tools you use. The eight tools for managing natural resources are money/labor, human creativity, grazing, animal impact, fire, rest, living organisms and [[Agricultural science|science]]/technology. To be successful you need to use all these tools to the best of your ability.
#Test your decisions with questions that are designed to help ensure all your decisions are socially, environmentally and financially sound for both the short and long term.
#Monitor [[Proactivity|proactively]], before your managed system becomes more imbalanced. This way the manager can take adaptive corrective action quickly, before the ecosystem services are lost. Always assume your plan is less than perfect and use a [[feedback loop]] that includes monitoring for the earliest signs of failure, adjusting and re-planning as needed. In other words, use a "[[wikt:canary in a coal mine|canary in a coal mine]]" adaptive approach.

== Four principles ==
Holistic management planned grazing has four key principles that take advantage of the [[symbiotic]] relationship between large herds of grazing animals, their [[predator]]s and the grasslands that support them:&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Principles of Holistic Management, Empowering Caretakers of the Land|url=http://www.savoryinstitute.com/holistic-management/principles-of-holistic-management/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109072440/http://www.savoryinstitute.com/holistic-management/principles-of-holistic-management/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 January 2012|work=Savory Institute|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Nature functions as a [[holistic community]] with a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship between people, animals and the land. If you remove or change the behavior of any [[keystone species]] like the large grazing herds, you have an unexpected and wide-ranging negative impact on other areas of the environment.
#It is absolutely crucial that any agricultural planning system must be flexible enough to adapt to [[Complex systems|nature’s complexity]], since all environments are different and have constantly changing local conditions.
#[[Animal husbandry]] using [[Domestication|domestic species]] can be used as a substitute for lost keystone species. Thus when managed properly in a way that mimics nature, agriculture can heal the land and even benefit wildlife, while at the same time benefiting people.
#Time and timing is the most important factor when planning land use. Not only is it crucial to understand how long to use the land for agriculture and how long to rest, it is equally important to understand exactly when and where the land is ready for that use and rest.

== Criticism ==
Claims that holistic grazing can have a profound effect on climate change by making grazing cattle carbon negative have no basis in any peer-reviewed scientific literature and are based on literature only available on the Savory Institute website. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2014/aug/04/eat-more-meat-and-save-the-world-the-latest-implausible-farming-miracle|title=Eat more meat and save the world: the latest implausible farming miracle {{!}} George Monbiot|last=Monbiot|first=George|date=2014-08-04|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service. p.32: "These results refute prior claims that animal trampling associated with high stocking rates or grazing pressures in rotational grazing systems enhance soil properties and promote hydrological function."&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, a survey article by Briske et al.

A paper by Richard Teague, a coauthor of the USDA paper, et al. pointed out that Briske had examined rotational systems in general and not Savory's holistic planned grazing process, developed in the 1960s when Savory recognized that a hundred years of rotational and other prescribed grazing systems had exacerbated desertification, even in the U.S. as stated in Savory’s TED talk.  The paper contrasted the success reported by many ranchers practicing multi-paddock grazing with the general lack of evidence found by formal research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Teague |first=Richard |first2=Fred |last2=Provenza |first3=Brien |last3=Norton |first4=Tim |last4=Steffens |first5=Matthew |last5=Barnes |first6=Mort |last6=Kothmann |first7=Roy |last7=Roath |year=2008 |chapter=Benefits of Multi-Paddock Grazing Management on Rangelands: Limitations of Experimental Grazing Research and Knowledge Gaps | editor-first=H.G. |editor-last=Schroder |title=Grasslands: Ecology, Management and Restoration |publisher=Nova Science Publishers |place=New York |pages=41–80 |isbn=978-1-60692-023-7 |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.posterous.com/circleranch/7LUk5o99J7YM4C5iC5X11lrOExFZJJicGpGRz2qk6NGkxX9ymeLRzXwr63aj/TeaguePaper.doc?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJFZAE65UYRT34AOQ&amp;Expires=1365062329&amp;Signature=FHjrGi7SJy1TJGH89tsYm1f%2F6DA%3D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Rangelands  |volume=9 |number=4 |date=August 1987 |title=Southern Africa's Experience with Intensive Short Duration Grazing |first=Jon |last=Skovlin |pages=162–167 |jstor=3900978}}&lt;/ref&gt; that compared short duration grazing (SDG) and Savory Grazing Method (SGM) in southern Africa and found no evidence of range improvement, a slight economic improvement of a seven-unit intensive system with more animals but with individual weight loss. That study found no evidence for soil improvement, but instead that increased trampling had led to soil compaction.

In March 2013, the Savory Institute published a research portfolio with selected abstracts of papers, theses and reports supporting holistic management and responding to some of their critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Savory Institute |title=Holistic Management Research Portfolio |date=March 2013 |accessdate=4 December 2015 |url=http://www.savoryinstitute.net/media/40606/Savory_Inst_HM_Research_Portfolio_March2013.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208152705/http://www.savoryinstitute.net/media/40606/Savory_Inst_HM_Research_Portfolio_March2013.pdf |archivedate=8 December 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month Savory was a guest speaker with TED and gave a presentation titled "How to Fight Desertification and Reverse Climate Change".

== Support ==
A few scientists have focused much of their research to demonstrate the science behind how Holistic Planned Grazing (or Adaptive Multi-Paddock Grazing) does improve soil health and there is a growing body of research work which is reversing the claim that the only evidence for holistic management is anecdotal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Itzkan|first1=Seth|title=Key Research Paper Summaries Germane to Holistic Management|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XlQeLBDHnhXt_5_-jY1NIerQfQhls6CzS3Qx5_Um1kQ/pub|publisher=Google Drive|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil scientist Dr. Christine Jones from Australia with much of her research available on her [http://www.amazingcarbon.com/ website], wrote an article in which she discussed the research done by Dr. Mark Adams from the University of Sydney regarding the soil's ability to sequester methane.

Dr. Richard Teague from Texas A&amp;M Agrilife has a number of different studies that he has undertaken focusing on [http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/7/10/13500 GHG mitigation],  as well as an [http://www.jswconline.org/content/71/2/156.full.pdf article] on the role of ruminants in reducing agriculture’s carbon that was co-authored with  Dr. Rattan Lal of Ohio State University. Teague has also done specific [https://ca.news.yahoo.com/alberta-ranchers-intensive-grazing-practices-004347231.html research in Canada] and [http://fergusonfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/StevenApfelbaum-DiggingDeeper.pdf Texas] comparing the increased carbon sequestration on land where people are practicing Holistic Planned Grazing in comparison to their neighbors that are not. On average in the Texas study the holistically grazed land added 3 tons Carbon/ha/yr more than the heavy continuously grazed neighboring land.

Dr. Keith Weber from Idaho State University who shows [https://issuu.com/defendingbeef/docs/weber__k.t._et_al._2013_effect_of_g how holistic planned grazing improves soil moisture retention on semi-arid rangelands]. This water retention leads to more plant growth which increases soil carbon and thus carbon sequestration.

Some qualitative studies show the improved profitability and sustainability of holistically managed operations and the efficacy of Holistic Management as a whole farm/ranch planning tool. In particular, Dr. Deborah Stinner, Dr. Benjamin Stinner of (Ohio State University at Wooster), and Ed Marsolf wrote an article [https://holisticmanagement.org/blog/biodiversity-as-an-organizing-principle/ about Holistic Management and how biodiversity is an organizing principle in agroecosystem management]. Another was done by Charley Orchard as he surveyed ranchers in the Northern Rockies and the [https://holisticmanagement.org/holistic-management/success-stories/northern-rockies-holistic-management-survey-results/ results they had achieved].

The [[impeachment]] of [[Bill Clinton]], the 42nd [[President of the United States]], was initiated in December 1998 by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and led to a trial in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on two charges, one of [[perjury]] and one of [[obstruction of justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erskine|first=Daniel H.|date=2008|title=The Trial of Queen Caroline and the Impeachment of President Clinton: Law As a Weapon for Political Reform|url=http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_globalstudies/vol7/iss1/2/|journal=Washington University Global Studies Law Review|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=|issn=1546-6981}}&lt;/ref&gt; These charges stemmed from a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Clinton by [[Paula Jones]].

Leading to the impeachment, [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|Independent Counsel]] [[Ken Starr]] turned over documentation to the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]]. Chief Prosecutor [[David Schippers]] and his team reviewed the material and determined there was sufficient evidence to impeach the president. As a result, four charges were considered by the full House of Representatives; two passed, making Clinton the second president to be impeached, after [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|Andrew Johnson in 1868]], and only the third against whom articles of impeachment had been brought before the full House for consideration ([[Richard Nixon]] resigned from the presidency in 1974, while an [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon|impeachment process against him]] was underway).

The trial in the United States Senate began right after the seating of the [[106th United States Congress|106th Congress]], in which the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] held 55 Senate seats. A [[supermajority|two-thirds vote]] (67 senators) was required to remove Clinton from office. 50 senators voted to remove Clinton on the obstruction of justice charge and 45 voted to remove him on the perjury charge; no member of his own [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] voted guilty on either charge. Clinton, like Johnson a century earlier, was acquitted on all charges.

==Background==
{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}&lt;!--only one paragraph has citations--&gt;
In 1994, [[Paula Jones]] filed a lawsuit accusing Clinton of [[sexual harassment]] when he was governor of Arkansas. Clinton attempted to delay a trial until after he left office, but in May 1997 the Supreme Court unanimously ordered the case to proceed and shortly thereafter the pre-trial discovery process commenced. Jones' attorneys wanted to prove that Clinton had engaged in a pattern of behavior with women that lent support to her claims. In late 1997, [[Linda Tripp]] began secretly recording conversations with her friend [[Monica Lewinsky]], a former intern and [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] employee, in which Lewinsky divulged that she had had a sexual relationship with the President. Tripp shared this information with Paula Jones' lawyers, who put Lewinsky on their witness list in December 1997. According to the Starr report, after Lewinsky appeared on the witness list Clinton began taking steps to conceal their relationship, including suggesting she file a false [[affidavit]], suggesting she use cover stories, concealing gifts he had given her, and helping her obtain a job to her liking.

Clinton gave a sworn deposition on January 17, 1998, where he denied having a "sexual relationship", "sexual affair" or "sexual relations" with Lewinsky. He also denied that he was ever alone with her. His lawyer, Robert Bennet, stated with Clinton present that Lewinsky's affidavit showed that there was no sex in any manner, shape or form between Clinton and Lewinsky. The Starr Report states that the following day, Clinton "coached" his secretary Betty Curie into repeating his denials should she be called to testify.

The judge in the Jones case later ruled the Lewinsky matter immaterial, and threw out the case in April 1998 on the grounds that Jones had failed to show any damages. After Jones appealed, Clinton agreed in November 1998 to settle the case for $850,000 while still admitting no wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Baker |title=Clinton Settles Paula Jones Lawsuit for $850,000 |date=November 14, 1998 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/jones111498.htm |work=The Washington Post |access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent counsel investigation==
The charges arose from an investigation by [[Ken Starr]], an [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|Independent Counsel]]. Originally dealing with [[Whitewater scandal|Whitewater]], Starr, with the approval of [[United States Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]], conducted a wide-ranging investigation of alleged abuses, including the [[Whitewater affair]], [[White House travel office controversy|the firing of White House travel agents]], and the alleged misuse of FBI files. On January 12, 1998, [[Linda Tripp]], who had been working with the Jones lawyers, informed Starr that Lewinsky was preparing to commit perjury in the Jones case and had asked Tripp to do the same. She also said Clinton's friend Vernon Jordan was assisting Lewinsky. Based on the connection to Jordan, who was under scrutiny in the Whitewater probe, Starr obtained approval from Reno to expand his investigation into whether Lewinsky and others were breaking the law.

A much-quoted statement from Clinton's [[grand jury]] testimony showed him questioning the precise use of the word "is". Contending that his statement that "there's nothing going on between us" had been truthful because he had no ongoing relationship with Lewinsky at the time he was questioned, Clinton said, "It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is. If the—if he—if 'is' means is and never has been, that is not—that is one thing. If it means there is none, that was a completely true statement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Starr Report: Narrative | url= http://icreport.access.gpo.gov/report/6narrit.htm#N_1091_ | work= Nature of President Clinton's Relationship with Monica Lewinsky | publisher= [[United States Government Printing Office|U.S. Government Printing Office]] | location= Washington, D.C. | date= May 19, 2004 | accessdate= May 9, 2009 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20001203073600/http://icreport.access.gpo.gov/report/6narrit.htm#N_1091_ | archivedate= December 3, 2000 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starr obtained further evidence of inappropriate behavior by seizing the computer hard drive and email records of Monica Lewinsky. Based on the president's conflicting testimony, Starr concluded that Clinton had committed perjury. Starr submitted his findings to Congress in a lengthy document (the so-called [[Starr Report]]), and simultaneously posted the report, which included descriptions of encounters between Clinton and Lewinsky, on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9809/12/clinton.web/index.html |title=Starr report puts Internet into overdrive |publisher=CNN  |date=September 12, 1998 |accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starr was criticized by Democrats for spending $70&amp;nbsp;million on an investigation that substantiated only perjury and [[obstruction of justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.org/aim-report/aim-report-the-independent-counsels-final-report/AIM |title=Report: The Independent Counsel's Final Report |publisher=Aim.org |accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Starr also contend that his investigation was highly politicized because it regularly leaked tidbits of information to the press in violation of legal ethics, and because his report included lengthy descriptions which were humiliating yet irrelevant to the legal case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NEWS+LEAKS+PROMPT+LAWYER+TO+SEEK+SANCTIONS+AGAINST+STARR'S...-a083810333 |title=News leaks prompt lawyer to seek sanctions against Starr's Office |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-a-palermo/the-starr-report-how-to-_b_71821.html |title=The Starr Report: How To Impeach A President (Repeat) |work=Huffington Post  |accessdate=May 23, 2011 |date=March 28, 2008 |first=Joseph A. |last=Palermo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impeachment by House of Representatives==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:ClintonImpeach.jpg|thumb|left|Clinton, after being impeached by the House, appeared with many House Democrats, Minority Leader [[Dick Gephardt]], Vice President [[Al Gore]] and First Lady [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] as he reaffirmed his intention not to resign.]] --&gt;
Since Ken Starr had already completed an extensive investigation, the [[House Judiciary Committee]] conducted no investigations of its own into Clinton's alleged wrongdoing, and it held no serious impeachment-related hearings before the 1998 midterm elections. Nevertheless, impeachment was one of the major issues in the election.

In [[United States House elections, 1998|November 1998]], the Democrats picked up five seats in the House although the Republicans still maintained majority control.&lt;ref name=kc.l&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989559,00.html | work=Time | title=Fall Of The House Of Newt | date=November 16, 1998 | accessdate=May 5, 2010 | first1=Nancy | last1=Gibbs | first2=Michael | last2=Duffy}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The results were a particular embarrassment for [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]], who, before the election, had been reassured by private polling that Clinton's scandal would result in Republican gains of up to thirty House seats.&lt;ref name=kc.l /&gt; Shortly after the elections, Gingrich, who had been one of the leading advocates for impeachment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=JAKE TAPPER (@jaketapper) |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=2937633&amp;page=1 |title=Gingrich Admits to Affair During Clinton Impeachment – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=March 9, 2007 |accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced he would resign from Congress as soon as he was able to find somebody to fill his vacant seat;&lt;ref name=kc.l /&gt; Gingrich fulfilled this pledge, and officially resigned from Congress on January 3, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=u6VAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NQgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4793,3174090|title = Special election set to replace Gingrich|last = |first = |date = Jan 5, 1999|work = Ocala Star-Banner|access-date = |via = Google News archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impeachment proceedings were initiated during the post-election, "[[lame duck session|lame duck]]" session of the outgoing [[105th United States Congress]]. Unlike the case of the 1974 [[impeachment process against Richard Nixon]], the committee hearings were perfunctory but the floor debate in the whole House was spirited on both sides. The [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker-designate]], Representative [[Bob Livingston]], chosen by the Republican Party Conference to replace Gingrich as House Speaker, announced the end of his candidacy for Speaker and his resignation from Congress from the floor of the House after his own marital infidelity came to light.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;Kurtz, Howard, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/flynt121998.htm "Larry Flynt, Investigative Pornographer"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', December 19, 1998. Page C01. Retrieved 21-June-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same speech, Livingston also encouraged Clinton to resign. Clinton chose to remain in office and urged Livingston to reconsider his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Livingston bows out of the speakership | url= http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/12/19/livingston.quits/ | first= Jonathan | last= Karl |author2=[[Associated Press]]  | work=All Politics | publisher=CNN | date= December 19, 1998 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070313140054/http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/12/19/livingston.quits/ | archivedate= March 13, 2007 | accessdate=May 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many other prominent Republican members of Congress (including [[Dan Burton]]&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; of Indiana, [[Helen Chenoweth]]&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; of Idaho and [[Henry Hyde]]&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; of Illinois, the chief House manager of Clinton's trial in the Senate) had infidelities exposed about this time, all of whom voted for impeachment.  Publisher [[Larry Flynt]] offered a reward for such information, and many supporters of Clinton accused Republicans of hypocrisy.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clinton thus became the second U.S. president to be impeached, following [[impeachment and acquittal of Andrew Johnson|Andrew Johnson in 1868]]. (Clinton was the third sitting president against whom the House of Representatives initiated impeachment proceedings since 1789.)

Five Democrats ([[Virgil Goode]] of Virginia, [[Ralph Hall]] of Texas, [[Paul McHale]] of Pennsylvania, [[Charles Stenholm]] of Texas and [[Gene Taylor (Mississippi)|Gene Taylor]] of Mississippi) voted in favor of three of the four articles of impeachment, but only Taylor voted for the abuse of power charge. Five Republicans ([[Amo Houghton]] of New York, [[Peter T. King|Peter King]] of New York, [[Connie Morella]] of Maryland, [[Chris Shays]] of Connecticut and [[Mark Souder]] of Indiana) voted against the first perjury charge. Eight more Republicans ([[Sherwood Boehlert]] of New York, [[Michael Castle]] of Delaware, [[Phil English]] of Pennsylvania, [[Nancy Johnson]] of Connecticut, [[Jay Kim]] of California, [[Jim Leach]] of Iowa, [[John M. McHugh|John McHugh]] of New York and [[Ralph Regula]] of Ohio), but not Souder, voted against the obstruction charge. Twenty-eight Republicans voted against the second perjury charge, sending it to defeat, and eighty-one voted against the abuse of power charge.

Article I charged that Clinton lied to the grand jury concerning:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/articles122098.htm#full1 Text of Article I] Washington Post December 20, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquittal by the Senate==

[[Image:CongRec.png|thumb|right|upright|''[[Congressional Record]]'' from February 12, 1999, showing the end of Clinton's impeachment trial]]

The Senate trial began on January 7, 1999, with [[Chief Justice of the United States]] [[William Rehnquist]] presiding.  The first day consisted of formal presentation of the charges against Clinton, and of Rehnquist swearing in all arguants in the trial.

Thirteen House Republicans from the Judiciary Committee served as "managers", the equivalent of prosecutors:
* Chairman [[Henry Hyde]] of [[Illinois]]
* [[Jim Sensenbrenner]] of [[Wisconsin]]
* [[Bill McCollum]] of Florida
* [[George Gekas]] of [[Pennsylvania]]
* [[Charles Canady]] of Florida
* [[Steve Buyer]] of [[Indiana]]
* [[Ed Bryant]] of [[Tennessee]]
* [[Steve Chabot]] of [[Ohio]]
* [[Bob Barr]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]
* [[Asa Hutchinson]] of [[Arkansas]]
* [[Chris Cannon]] of [[Utah]]
* [[James E. Rogan]] of California
* [[Lindsey Graham]] of [[South Carolina]]

Clinton was defended by [[Cheryl Mills]]. Clinton's counsel staff included [[Charles Ruff]], [[David E. Kendall]], [[Dale Bumpers]], [[Bruce Lindsey]], [[Nicole Seligman]], [[Lanny A. Breuer]] and [[Gregory B. Craig]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/defense.htm Defense Who's Who], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', January 19, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

A resolution on rules and procedure for the trial was adopted unanimously on the following day; however, senators tabled the question of whether to call witnesses in the trial. The trial remained in recess while briefs were filed by the House (January 11) and Clinton (January 13).

The managers presented their case over three days, from January 14 to 16, with discussion of the facts and background of the case; detailed cases for both articles of impeachment (including excerpts from videotaped grand jury testimony that Clinton had made the previous August); matters of interpretation and application of the laws governing perjury and obstruction of justice; and argument that the evidence and precedents justified removal of the President from office by virtue of "willful, premeditated, deliberate corruption of the nation's system of justice through perjury and obstruction of justice."&lt;ref name="historyplace"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense presentation took place from January 19–21. Clinton's defense counsel argued that Clinton's grand jury testimony had too many inconsistencies to be a clear case of perjury, that the investigation and impeachment had been tainted by partisan political bias, that the President's approval rating of more than 70 percent indicated that his ability to govern had not been impaired by the scandal, and that the managers had ultimately presented "an unsubstantiated, circumstantial case that does not meet the constitutional standard to remove the President from office".&lt;ref name="historyplace" /&gt; January 22 and 23 were devoted to questions from members of the Senate to the House managers and Clinton's defense counsel. Under the rules, all questions (over 150) were to be written down and given to Rehnquist to read to the party being questioned.

On January 25, Senator [[Robert Byrd]] of [[West Virginia]] moved for dismissals of both articles of impeachment for lack of merit. On the following day, Rep. Bryant moved to call witnesses to the trial, a question that the Senate had scrupulously avoided to that point. In both cases, the Senate voted to deliberate on the question in private session, rather than public, televised procedure. On January 27, the Senate voted on both motions in public session; the motion to dismiss failed on a nearly party line vote of 56–44, while the motion to depose witnesses passed by the same margin. A day later, the Senate voted down motions to move directly to a vote on the articles of impeachment and to suppress videotaped depositions of the witnesses from public release, Feingold again voting with the Republicans.

Over three days, February 1–3, House managers took videotaped closed-door depositions from Monica Lewinsky, Clinton's friend [[Vernon Jordan]], and White House aide [[Sidney Blumenthal]]. On February 4, however, the Senate voted 70–30 that excerpting these videotapes would suffice as testimony, rather than calling live witnesses to appear at trial. The videos were played in the Senate on February 6, featuring 30 excerpts of Lewinsky discussing her affidavit in the Paula Jones case, the hiding of small gifts Clinton had given her, and his involvement in procurement of a job for Lewinsky.

On February 8, closing arguments were presented with each side allotted a three-hour time slot. On the President's behalf, White House Counsel Charles Ruff declared:

{{quote|There is only one question before you, albeit a difficult one, one that is a question of fact and law and constitutional theory. Would it put at risk the liberties of the people to retain the President in office? Putting aside partisan animus, if you can honestly say that it would not, that those liberties are safe in his hands, then you must vote to acquit.&lt;ref name="historyplace" /&gt;}}

Chief Prosecutor Henry Hyde countered:

{{quote|A failure to convict will make the statement that lying under oath, while unpleasant and to be avoided, is not all that serious ... We have reduced lying under oath to a breach of etiquette, but only if you are the President ... And now let us all take our place in history on the side of honor, and, oh, yes, let right be done.&lt;ref name="historyplace" /&gt;}}

On February 9, after voting against a public deliberation on the verdict, the Senate began closed-door deliberations instead. On February 12, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] emerged from its closed deliberations and voted on the articles of impeachment. A [[supermajority|two-thirds vote]], 67 votes, would have been necessary to convict and remove the President from office. The perjury charge was defeated with 45 votes for conviction and 55 against.&lt;ref name=senvoteai&gt;{{cite web

The five Republican senators who voted against conviction on both charges were [[John Chafee]] of Rhode Island, [[Susan Collins]] of Maine, [[Jim Jeffords]] of Vermont, [[Olympia Snowe]] of Maine, and [[Arlen Specter]] of Pennsylvania. Specter, who said he was not prepared to cast a guilty or not guilty vote, voted "not proved", which was counted as a not guilty vote.&lt;ref name="arlen quote2"&gt;{{cite news | author=Specter, Arlen | title = Sen. Specter's closed-door impeachment statement |date=February 12, 1999 | url = http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/12/senate.statements/specter.html |publisher=CNN | accessdate =March 13, 2008 | quote= My position in the matter is that the case has not been proved. I have gone back to Scottish law where there are three verdicts: guilty, not guilty, and not proved. I am not prepared to say on this record that President Clinton is not guilty. But I am certainly not prepared to say that he is guilty. There are precedents for a Senator voting present. I hope that I will be accorded the opportunity to vote not proved in this case. [...] But on this record, the proofs are not present. Juries in criminal cases under the laws of Scotland have three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty, not proved. Given the option in this trial, I suspect that many Senators would choose 'not proved' instead of 'not guilty'.&lt;br&gt;That is my verdict: not proved. The President has dodged perjury by calculated evasion and poor interrogation. Obstruction of justice fails by gaps in the proofs. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The additional five Republican senators who voted "not guilty" only on the perjury charge were [[Slade Gorton]] of Washington, [[Richard Shelby]] of Alabama, [[Ted Stevens]] of Alaska, [[Fred Thompson]] of Tennessee, and [[John Warner]] of Virginia.

===Contempt of court citation===
In April 1999, about two months after being acquitted by the Senate, Clinton was cited by [[Federal District Judge]] [[Susan Webber Wright]] for civil [[contempt of court]] for his "willful failure" to obey her repeated [[court order|orders]] to testify truthfully in the Paula Jones [[sexual harassment]] lawsuit. For this citation, Clinton was assessed a $90,000 fine, and the matter was referred to the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] to see if disciplinary action would be appropriate.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/04/12/clinton.contempt/ Clinton found in civil contempt for Jones testimony – April 12, 1999] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408090020/http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/04/12/clinton.contempt/ |date=April 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Clinton's January 17, 1998, [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] where he was placed under oath, the judge wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Simply put, the president's deposition testimony regarding whether he had ever been alone with Ms. (Monica) Lewinsky was intentionally false, and his statements regarding whether he had ever engaged in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky likewise were intentionally false ...&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the day before leaving office in January 2001, President Clinton agreed to a five-year suspension of his [[Arkansas]] [[practice of law|law license]] as part of an agreement with the independent counsel{{Clarify|date=August 2010}} to end the investigation.&lt;ref name="arkcomm"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Neal v. Clinton |opinion=Civ. No. 2000-5677 |pinpoint=Agreed Order of Discipline |court=Ark. Cir.

However, as is customary, he was allowed 40 days to appeal an otherwise-automatic disbarment. The former President resigned from the Supreme Court bar during the 40-day appeals period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conlaw.usatoday.findlaw.com/supreme_court/orders/2001/111301pzor.html US Supreme Court Order]. FindLaw. November 13, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil settlement with Paula Jones===
Eventually, the court dismissed the Paula Jones harassment lawsuit, before trial, on the grounds that Jones failed to demonstrate any damages. However, while the dismissal was on appeal, Clinton entered into an out-of-court settlement by agreeing to pay Jones $850,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Jones v. Clinton finally settled | publisher=CNN | date = November 13, 1998 | url = http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/11/13/jones/ | accessdate =January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Clinton-Jones Settlement Text | publisher=CNN | date = November 13, 1998 | url = http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/11/13/jones.text/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political ramifications===
[[File:19a.AntiImpeachRally.WDC.17December1998 (22717930575).jpg|thumb|left|Opponents of Clinton's impeachment demonstrating outside the Capitol in December 1998]]
Polls conducted during 1998 and early 1999 showed that only about one-third of Americans supported Clinton's impeachment or conviction. However, one year later, when it was clear that House impeachment would not lead to the ousting of the President, half of Americans said in a CNN/''USA Today''/Gallup poll that they supported impeachment but 57% approved of the Senate's decision to keep him in office and two thirds of those polled said the impeachment was harmful to the country.&lt;ref&gt;Keating Holland. [http://archives.cnn.com/1999/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/16/impeach.poll/ "A year after Clinton impeachment, public approval grows of House decision"]. CNN. December 16, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Clinton's job approval rating rose during the [[Lewinsky scandal]] and subsequent impeachment, his poll numbers with regard to questions of honesty, integrity and moral character declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/voters082398.htm |title=American Voters See Two Very Different Bill Clintons |work=The Washington Post |author=David S. Broder, Richard Morin |date=August 23, 1998 |page=A1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, "moral character" and "honesty" weighed heavily in the next presidential election. According to ''[[The Daily Princetonian]]'', after the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], "post-election polls found that, in the wake of Clinton-era scandals, the single most significant reason people voted for [[George W. Bush|Bush]] was for his moral character."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2004/05/07/news/10533.shtml |title=Singer authors book on the role of ethics in Bush presidency |work=[[The Daily Princetonian]] |author=Deborah Arotsky |date=May 7, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033343/http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2004/05/07/news/10533.shtml |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=102219 |title=Of Candidates and Character |work=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |author=Stephen E.

According to an analysis of the election by [[Stanford University]]:

{{quote|A more political explanation is the belief in Gore campaign circles that disapproval of President Clinton's personal behavior was a serious threat to the vice president's prospects. Going into the election the one negative element in the public's perception of the state of the nation was the belief that the country was morally on the wrong track, whatever the state of the economy or world affairs. According to some insiders, anything done to raise the association between Gore and Clinton would have produced a net loss of support—the impact of Clinton's personal negatives would outweigh the positive impact of his job performance on support for Gore. Thus, hypothesis four suggests that a previously unexamined variable played a major role in 2000—the retiring president's personal approval.&lt;ref name=clm.&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.stanford.edu/~mfiorina/2000%20BJPS%20Revision2_Paper.pdf |title=The 2000 U.S. Presidential Election: Can Retrospective Voting Be Saved? |last1=Fiorina |first1=M. |last2=Abrams |first2=S. |last3=Pope |first3=J. |doi=10.1017/S0007123403000073 |journal=British Journal of Political Science |volume=33 |issue=2 |date=March 2003 |pages=163–87 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Stanford analysis, however, presented different theories and mainly argued that Gore had lost because he decided to distance himself from Clinton during the campaign.  The writers of it concluded:&lt;ref name=clm. /&gt;

{{quote|We find that Gore's oft-criticized personality was not a cause of his under-performance. Rather, the major cause was his failure to receive a historically normal amount of credit for the performance of the Clinton administration ... [and] failure to get normal credit reflected Gore's peculiar campaign which in turn reflected fear of association with Clinton's behavior.&lt;ref name=clm. /&gt;}}

According to the America's Future Foundation:

{{quote|In the wake of the Clinton scandals, independents warmed to Bush's promise to 'restore honor and dignity to the White House'. According to [[Voter News Service]], the personal quality that mattered most to voters was 'honesty'. Voters who chose 'honesty' preferred Bush over Gore by over a margin of five to one. Forty Four percent of Americans said the Clinton scandals were important to their vote.

[[Al Gore]] reportedly confronted Clinton after the election, and "tried to explain that keeping Clinton under wraps [during the campaign] was a rational response to polls showing swing voters were still mad as hell over the Year of Monica".  According to the AP, "during the one-on-one meeting at the White House, which lasted more than an hour, Gore used uncommonly blunt language to tell Clinton that his sex scandal and low personal approval ratings were a hurdle he could not surmount in his campaign ...

===Ensuing events for 13 House managers===
Of the 13 members of the House who managed Clinton's trial in the Senate, one lost to a Democrat in his 2000 bid for re-election ([[James E. Rogan]], to [[Adam Schiff]]). [[Charles Canady]] retired from Congress in 2000, following through on a previous [[term limits]] pledge to voters, and [[Bill McCollum]] ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. [[Asa Hutchinson]], after being re-elected in 2000, left Congress after being appointed head of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] by President [[George W. Bush]]. In 2014, Hutchinson was elected governor of Arkansas. In 2002, two former House managers lost their seats after [[redistricting]] placed them in the same district as another incumbent ([[Bob Barr]] lost to [[John Linder]] in a Republican primary, and [[George Gekas]] lost to Democrat [[Tim Holden]]), while two more ran for the U.S. Senate ([[Lindsey Graham]] successfully, [[Ed Bryant]] unsuccessfully). The other five remained in the House well into the 2000s (decade), and two ([[Jim Sensenbrenner]] and [[Steve Chabot]]) are still members (although Chabot lost his seat to [[Steve Driehaus]] in the 2008 elections; Chabot defeated Driehaus in a 2010 rematch). In 2009, Sensenbrenner served again as a manager for the impeachment of Judge [[Samuel B. Kent]] of Texas&lt;ref name=sensenbrennerkent&gt;{{cite press release

Military relations between [[Israel]] and the [[United States]] have been consistently close,&lt;ref&gt;Gregory S. Mahler, ''Israel After Begin'', p. 45. SUNY Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-7914-0367-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting shared security interests in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="sent-NA"&gt;United States: External Affairs", in ''Jane's Sentinel: North America 2007''.

Jane's Information Group, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A major purchaser and user of U.S. military equipment, Israel is also involved in the joint development of military technology and regularly engages in joint military exercises involving United States and other forces.&lt;ref name="sent-NA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sent-EM"/&gt; The relationship has deepened gradually over time, though, as [[Alan Dowty]] puts it, it was "not a simple linear process of growing cooperation, but rather a series of tendentious bargaining situations with different strategic and political components in each."&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Alan Dowty, foreword in Abraham Ben-Zvi, ''Lyndon B. Johnson and the Politics of Arms Sales to Israel: in the shadow of the hawk'', p. vii. Routledge, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7146-5580-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. President Obama's former Secretary of Defense [[Robert M. Gates]] categorized the relationship between U.S. and Israel with the following: "I cannot recall a time during my public life when our two countries have had a closer defense relationship.  The U.S. and Israel are cooperating closely in areas such as missile defense technology, the [[Joint Strike Fighter]], and in training exercises such as Juniper Stallion...our bilateral relationship and this dialogue is so critical because Israel lives at the focal point of some of the biggest security challenges facing the free world: [[violent extremism]], the proliferation of nuclear technologies, and the dilemmas posed by adversarial and failed states.  And I think it important, especially at a time of such dramatic change in the region, to reaffirm once more America’s unshakable commitment to Israel’s security."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID%3D4797 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414143509/http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4797 |archivedate=2013-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kampeas, Ron.

==Overview==
[[File:Soldiers firing a M120 120mm mortar (Iraq).jpg|thumb|left|250px|American soldiers firing an Israeli-made [[M120 mortar]] in [[Iraq]]]]

Following the Second World War, the “new postwar era witnessed an intensive involvement of the United States in the political and economic affairs of the [[Middle East]], in contrast to the hands-off attitude characteristic of the prewar period. [U]nder Truman the United States had to face and define its policy in all three sectors that provided the root causes of American interests in the region: the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat, the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|birth of Israel]], and [[petroleum]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lenczowski | first=George | authorlink=George Lenczowski | year=1990 |  title=American Presidents and the Middle East | publisher=[[Duke University Press]] | ISBN=0-8223-0972-6 | page= 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first twenty years following [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israel's independence]], United States policy in the [[Middle East]] was driven by two major policy concerns: The prevention of an arms race in the [[Near East]],&lt;ref name="FRU_9_14_62"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/FRUS9_14_62.html |title=U.S. Willing To Sell Hawk Missile System to Israel (September 1962) |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |date=1962-09-14 |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the prevention of the spread of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence. The [[Presidency of Harry S. Truman|Truman Administration]] promulgated the [[Tripartite Declaration of 1950]] for these reasons, as well as to guarantee the territorial ''status quo'' determined by [[1949 Armistice Agreements]]. Israel's main military patron at the time was [[France]], which supported Israel by providing it with advanced military equipment and technology, such as the [[Dassault Mystère]] [[fighter-bomber]] aircraft. Initially, the U.S. government resisted pressure by Israel and [[Arab]] countries in the region to sell them advanced weapons. In response to the supply of advanced fighter aircraft by the [[USSR]] to [[Iraq]] and the [[United Arab Republic]], the U.S. government agreed to sell [[MIM-23 Hawk]] anti-aircraft missiles to Israel in 1962, as a "specific action designed to meet a specific situation" which "by no means constitutes change in U.S. policy in area.". The Hawk system was approved on the grounds that it was a "purely defensive" weapon.&lt;ref name="FRU_9_14_62"/&gt; Later, when [[Jordan]] threatened to turn to the [[USSR]] for weapons, the U.S. agreed to sell tanks and jet aircraft to Jordan in order to prevent the spread of Soviet influence, and in return, agreed to sell similar systems to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/arms4.html |title=U.S. Promises Arms Sale To Israel That Balances Sale to Jordan (March 1965) |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |date=1965-03-11 |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1960s, the U.S. government sought to establish a regional arms limitation agreement in the Middle East. The initiative lost steam in early 1965 after it was disclosed that the U.S. had been indirectly supplying weapons to Israel via [[West Germany]] since 1962, under the terms of a 1960 secret agreement to supply Israel with $80 million worth of armaments. The remainder of the agreement was fulfilled publicly, following its disclosure by the U.S., with Israel receiving shipments of [[M48 Patton]] tanks in 1965 and [[A-4E Skyhawk]] attack aircraft in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Geoffrey Bard, ''The Water's Edge and Beyond: defining the limits to domestic influence on U.S. Middle East policy''. Transaction Publishers, 1991. {{ISBN|0-88738-286-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DN-ST-85-08601.jpg|thumb|200px|An Israeli-built [[IAI Kfir]] used by the [[United States Navy]]. Israel leased 25 modified Kfirs to the United States from 1985 to 1989.]]
U.S. policy changed markedly after the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, in response to a perception that many Arab states (notably Egypt) had permanently drifted toward the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1968, with strong support from [[United States Congress|Congress]], U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] approved the sale of [[F-4 Phantom II]] fighters to Israel, establishing the precedent for U.S. support for Israel's [[Qualitative Military Edge|qualitative military edge]] over its neighbors. The U.S., however, would continue to supply arms to Israel's neighbors, particularly [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], in order to counter Soviet arms sales and influence in the region.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

During the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973, the U.S. mounted a major airlift codenamed [[Operation Nickel Grass]] to deliver weapons and supplies to Israel. Over 22,000 tons of [[tank]]s, [[artillery]], [[ammunition]], and other [[materiel]] were delivered to aid the Israeli military in response to a large-scale Soviet resupply effort of the Arab states. The operation was paralleled by a large-scale sealift of some 33,000 tons of materiel and the transfer of 40 F-4 Phantoms, 36 A-4 Skyhawks and twelve [[C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft to replace Israeli war losses.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Dunstan, ''The Yom Kippur War 1973: The Sinai'', p. 67. Osprey Publishing, 2003. {{ISBN|1-84176-221-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bilateral military cooperation deepened under the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration in the 1980s. In 1981, U.S. [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Caspar Weinberger]] and Israeli Minister of Defense [[Ariel Sharon]] signed the [[Strategic Cooperation Agreement]], establishing a framework for continued consultation and cooperation to enhance the national security of both countries. In November 1983, the two sides formed a [[Joint Political Military Group]], which still meets twice a year, to implement most provisions of the MOU.&lt;ref name="hadar"&gt;Leon T. Hadar, ''Quagmire: America in the Middle East'', p. 75. Cato Institute, 1992. {{ISBN|0-932790-94-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joint air and sea military exercises began in June 1984, and the United States has constructed facilities to [[War Reserve Stock|stockpile military equipment]] in Israel.

[[File:Stavridis gets distinguished ally of the IDF award from Gantz, 2013.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Admiral [[James G. Stavridis]] ''(left)'', then [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] and commander of [[United States European Command|U.S. European Command]], receives a first-of-its-kind "Distinguished Ally of the Israel Defense Forces" award from IDF Chief of Staff [[Benny Gantz]] in Tel Aviv in 2013]]
In 1987, the United States granted Israel the status of [[major non-NATO ally]], enabling it to compete equally with NATO and other US allies for contracts and purchase advanced US weapons systems. Israel became the largest recipient of [[United States military aid]] in the world (see [[#Military aid and procurement|military aid and procurement]] below).&lt;ref name="sent-EM" /&gt; In 1988, Reagan and Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]] signed a memorandum of understanding to formalize and perpetuate the work of the bilateral US-Israel military, security and economic working groups.&lt;ref name="hadar" /&gt;

In an effort to prevent Israel from retaliating against [[Iraq]]i [[SS-1 Scud]] missile attacks during the [[Persian Gulf war]] of 1991, and thereby breaking up the US-Arab coalition, the US dispatched [[MIM-104 Patriot]] surface-to-air missile batteries to Israel. The effort met with very limited success, with less than 10% and perhaps as few as none of the Scuds fired against Israel intercepted successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.org/issues/bmd/Patriot.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509023534/http://www.cdi.org/issues/bmd/Patriot.html |archivedate=2007-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Bill Clinton]] administration in the 1990s, the US government made efforts to bolster the Israeli government's military edge by allowing it to purchase $700m of the latest U.S. military equipment, including advanced fighters, attack helicopters and the [[Joint Direct Attack Munition]] system. A series of major joint military technology development projects was also instituted.&lt;ref name="sent-NA" /&gt;

Further extensive military cooperation took place under the [[George W. Bush]] administration, with Israel placing major orders for [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16I]] multirole fighters. During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], the United States provided a major resupply of jet fuel and [[precision-guided munition]] to replenish depleted Israeli stocks.&lt;ref name="sent-NA" /&gt;

==Joint military activity==
[[File:Marines and IDF soldiers fast rope from a CH-46E Sea Knight.jpg|thumb|200px|Israeli soldiers and US Marines from the [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] [[fast-rope]] from a [[CH-46 Sea Knight|CH-46E Sea Knight]] helicopter on the deck of the [[USS Kearsarge (LHD-3)]].]]

The United States and Israel cooperate closely in a number of areas of military activity.
The U.S. underwrites some of Israel's research and development of weapons, and has contributed significant amounts of money to Israeli defense projects such as the [[Merkava]] main battle tank and the [[IAI Lavi]] ground-attack aircraft. Israel is a participant in the [[F-35 Lightning II]] fighter development program and was offered access to the [[F-22 Raptor]] program, though it turned this down due to the high costs.&lt;ref name="sent-EM" /&gt;

The U.S. and Israel also cooperate jointly on a number of technology development programs, notably the [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow missile]] system and the [[Tactical High Energy Laser]] (also known as Nautilus).&lt;ref name="sent-EM" /&gt;
The two countries carry out regular exercises together, including carrying out biennial exercises codenamed [[Juniper Cobra]] intended to test interoperability between the two militaries. In addition, the Israeli port of [[Haifa]] is the main port of call in the eastern Mediterranean for the [[United States Sixth Fleet]], and Israel provides other logistical and maintenance support for U.S. forces in the region.&lt;ref name="sent-NA" /&gt; The two countries also share intelligence and maintain a joint anti-terrorist working group,&lt;ref name="sent-EM" /&gt; and in April 2007 their air forces committed to share information about mutually relevant procurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1182409609556&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull| title=IAF, USAF greatly upgrade cooperation| author=Yaakov Katz| publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]| date=June 22, 2007}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has stored military equipment in Israel since the early 1990s and may store additional equipment in Israel when withdrawing from Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yaakov |first=By |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=168393 |title=US may give Israel Iraq ammo - Israel - Jerusalem Post |website=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the only active foreign military installation on Israeli soil is the American [[AN/TPY-2]] early missile warning radar station on Mt. Keren also known as the [[Dimona Radar Facility]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2115955,00.html "How a U.S. Radar Station in the Negev Affects a Potential Israel-Iran Clash."] ''Time Magazine'', 30 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, United States and Israel began their biggest joint air and missile defense exercise, known as [[2012 US-Israel military exercise|Austere Challenge 12]], involving around 3,500 U.S. troops in the region along with 1,000 IDF personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/10/2012102195738284839.html US and Israel launch joint military drill], ''Al Jazeera'' October 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Germany and Britain also participated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-15/u-dot-s-dot-israeli-military-exercise-sending-message-to-iran |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817063133/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-15/u-dot-s-dot-israeli-military-exercise-sending-message-to-iran |archivedate=2014-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

The close military relationship between the U.S. and Israel has engendered a number of controversies over the years. [[Operation Nickel Grass]]—the U.S. resupply effort during the [[Yom Kippur War]]—led to retaliation by the [[Arab states]], as [[OAPEC]] members declared a complete oil embargo on the United States, provoking the [[1973 oil crisis]].

The United States stipulates that U.S. military equipment provided through the FMS program can be used only for internal security or defensive purposes. Consequently, after allegations were made that Israel had used [[cluster bombs]] for offensive purposes during the [[1982 Lebanon War]], the United States suspended shipments of cluster bombs to Israel&lt;ref name=clydemark&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel:US Foreign Assistance |author=Clyde R.

American use of its military aid for political pressure on Israel, as well as the economic and strategic restrictions attached to it, has made some Israelis question the value of American military aid. Israeli columnist [[Caroline Glick]] has argued that Israel's interests may be best served by ending the military assistance, and urged her government to initiate a conversation on cutting back on the assistance package.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carolineglick.com/e/2009/07/ Avoiding an American Ambush] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120731141238/http://www.carolineglick.com/e/2009/07/ |date=2012-07-31 }} Carolineglick.com, July 6, 2009. Originally published in the ''Jerusalem Post.''&lt;/ref&gt; Former Israeli Defense Minister [[Moshe Arens]] also opposes continued US aid, arguing that Israel no longer needs it. Several Israeli political parties, including [[National Union (Israel)|National Union]], oppose the aid and propose a gradual reduction in dependency on it.

The Kirk-Menendez-Schumer bill would for the first time commit the United States to provide "diplomatic, military and economic" support for offensive actions by Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thebulletin.org/war-bill |title=The war bill |last1=Gusterson |first1=Hugh |date=15 January 2014 |website=thebulletin.org |publisher=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, it was reported that Israel and the United States had been quietly discussing the prospect of ending US aid, with representatives from both countries agreeing at bilateral meetings that Israel no longer needs US military aid. According to [[Daniel C. Kurtzer]], a former US ambassador to Israel, "we may be reaching a point that after discussion of how to assure the security and intelligence cooperation, we can actually phase out the security assistance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtribune.com/2014/01/09/arens-argues-u-s-military-aid-no-longer-serves-israels-interests/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214125239/http://www.worldtribune.com/2014/01/09/arens-argues-u-s-military-aid-no-longer-serves-israels-interests/ |archivedate=2014-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]], when the United States temporarily suspended arms shipments to Israel, Israel reportedly reassessed its views on US aid, particularly on the view that it could always depend on a US resupply during wartime, and initiated new weapons projects to reduce its dependence on US weapons in favor of locally-made ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtribune.com/2014/10/20/israel-plans-reduce-arms-u-s/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150729121906/http://www.worldtribune.com/2014/10/20/israel-plans-reduce-arms-u-s/ |archivedate=2015-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1987, the U.S. has provided an average of $1.8 billion annually in the form of [[Foreign Military Sales]] (FMS), [[United States Foreign Military Financing|Foreign Military Financing]] (FMF) and funds to support research and development.&lt;ref name="sent-NA" /&gt; A bilateral memorandum of understanding was signed in January 2001, at the end of the Clinton administration, under which defense aid was increased to $2.4 billion annually from $1.8 billion, while the $1.2 billion of [[United States foreign aid|economic aid]] would be eliminated. This was predicated on the basis of the defense aid being increased by $60 million per year until the full amount was reached in 2008, while the economic aid is decreased by $120 million per year until eliminated.&lt;ref name="sent-EM" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CRS&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Foreign Aid to Israel – Report to Congress January 5, 200F6|date=2006-01-05|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|author=Jeremy M.

Retrieved August 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The package started in October 2008, when regular aid to Israel's economy ended.&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;''New York Times'', August 17, 2007 [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/16/world/middleeast/16cnd-israel.html?hp "US and Israel sign Military deal"]. Retrieved Aug 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials have insisted the aid is not tied, or meant to balance, simultaneous American plans to sell $20 billion worth of sophisticated arms to its Arab allies in the region, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="nyt1" /&gt; Former U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] assured Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] that the U.S. would help keep a "qualitative advantage" to Israel over other nations in the region.&lt;ref name="forbes_aid" /&gt;

The United States is the largest single supplier of military equipment to Israel. According to the U.S. Congressional Research Service, between 1998–2005 the U.S. accounted for the vast majority of Israel's arms transfer agreements, accounting for $9.1 billion out of $9.5 billion worth of agreements.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL33696.pdf Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 1998–2005]'', p. 62. Congressional Research Service, October 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Israel deals directly with U.S. companies for the vast majority of its military purchases from the United States, though it requires permission from the U.S. government for specific purchases. Permission is not always automatic; for instance, in March 2000 it became known that the Israeli government had been refused permission to purchase [[BGM-109 Tomahawk]] missiles.&lt;ref name="sent-EM" /&gt;

Israel has the world's largest F-16 fleet outside the [[United States Air Force]]. With the delivery of 102 F-16Is, scheduled through 2008, the [[Israeli Air Force]] will have a total F-16 inventory of 362, in addition to 106 F-15s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/wms/findPage.do?dsp=fec&amp;ci=12098&amp;rsbci=0&amp;fti=0&amp;ti=0&amp;sc=400 "More than 50 Lockheed Martin F-16s planned for Israel, more than $2 billion value"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. [[Lockheed Martin]] press release. June 19, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, the United States delivered the first two F-35 “Adir” stealth fighter planes, a version of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, arrived to Israel, the first of its kind in the Middle East. In April 2017, the United States delivered an additional three to total five F-35 stealth fighters now operated under the Israeli Air Force &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Three-F-35-stealth-fighter-jets-to-arrive-in-Israel-on-Sunday-488449 “THREE F-35 STEALTH FIGHTER JETS TO ARRIVE IN ISRAEL ON SUNDAY (2017)”]. &lt;/ref&gt; Israel was the first country outside of the United States to receive the F-35 and is expecting to receive a total of 50 over the coming years, achieving two full squadrons by 2022. This delivery is due to the strong partnership that the two countries had in the manufacturing of the fighter jet. Israeli technology, aerospace and defense companies played a pivotal role in the technological innovation giving the plane its immense capabilities. Eventually, Israel hopes to further accommodate its air force with the F-35B STOVL. Recent US Tomahawk strikes into Syria demonstrate that fixed airfields could easily be destroyed or temporarily be made unavailable. The F35B-model has both short take off and vertical landing capability, making it a strong threat in such a small region with constant warfare.&lt;ref&gt;

'''John Caldwell Holt''' (April 14, 1923 – September 14, 1985) was an American author and educator, a proponent of [[homeschooling]] and, specifically, the [[unschooling]] approach, and a pioneer in [[youth rights]] theory.

== From homeschooling to unschooling ==
Holt became disillusioned with the school system after several years of working within it; he became convinced that reform of the school system was not possible and began to advocate [[homeschooling]]. He believed that "children who were provided with a rich and stimulating learning environment would learn what they are ready to learn, when they are ready to learn it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/john-caldwell-holt-author-53781.html |title=Who Is John Caldwell Holt: Author |publisher=Essortment.com |date=1986-05-16 |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Holt believed that children did not need to be coerced into learning; they would do so naturally if given the freedom to follow their own interests and a rich assortment of resources. This line of thought came to be called [[unschooling]].

Holt's ''[[Growing Without Schooling]]'' (''GWS''), founded in 1977, was America's first home education newsletter. He also set up John Holt's Bookstore, which made selected books available by mail order. This brought in additional revenue that helped sustain the newsletter, which carried very little advertising.

Holt's sole book on homeschooling, ''[[Teach Your Own]]'', was published in 1981. It quickly became the "Bible" of the early homeschooling movement. It was revised by his colleague [[Patrick Farenga]] and republished in 2003 by Perseus Books.

== Holt on education ==

Holt wrote several books that have greatly influenced the unschooling movement. His writings have influenced many individuals and organizations, including the Evergreen State College, [[Caleb Gattegno]], Americans for a Society Free from Age Restrictions, the [[National Youth Rights Association]], and the Freechild Project.

Holt did not have a teaching degree, which many believe allowed for his work in the private school sector to make way for him to have a more objective opinion on the American school system. Being new to the environment, it is thought that he was able to make more objective distinctions than other educators, as to what the schools said they were doing and what they were actually doing. For the first many years of his teaching career, he maintained the belief that schools overall were not meeting their missions due to using the wrong methods and pedagogical approaches, and that these failures were the cause for rendering young scholars as children who were less willing to learn and more focused on avoiding the embarrassment and ridicule of not learning.&lt;ref name="Lant"&gt;Lant, J. L. (76/77). Considering John Holt [Electronic version]. Educational Studies, 7(4), 327-335&lt;/ref&gt;

As Holt wrote in his first book, ''How Children Fail'' (1964) "...after all, if they (meaning us) know that you can't do anything, then they won't blame you or punish you for not being able to do what you have been told to do." This notion led him to make changes within his own classroom to provide an environment in which his students would feel more comfortable and confident. With the support of his colleague Bill Hull, Holt began putting less emphasis on grades and tests, and began taking steps to decrease the notion of ranking the children. He focused on his students being able to grasp concepts, rather than having them work for the correct answer. Instead of using the typical methods to determine students' progress, he adopted a more student-centered approach. Patrick Farenga paraphrased Holt's distinction between good and bad students: "a good student is careful not to forget what he studied until after the test is taken."&lt;ref name="Farenga"&gt;Farenga, P. (1999, January). John Holt and the Origins of Contemporary Homeschooling. PATHS OF LEARNING: Options for Families and Communities&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, his new methods for teaching caused him to be terminated from his position, which he claimed was due to the school wanting to maintain "old 'new' ideas not new 'new' ideas."&lt;ref name="Lant" /&gt;

After leaving Colorado, Holt sought other opportunities in education. Although it took him some time to come to a conclusion about his own thoughts on education as well as make sense of his observations, studies, and data, ultimately he felt that schools were "a place where children learn to be stupid." Once he developed this conclusion, his focus shifted to making suggestions to help teachers and parents capable of teaching their children how to learn, thus prompting his second book, ''How Children Learn'', in 1967. Despite his successful career, he still met rejections, resentment, and false hopes from colleagues and school systems surrounding his ideas and methods. This reality pushed him further and further into the idea of deschooling.&lt;ref name="Lant" /&gt;

After a few more years of teaching and some visiting professor positions at area universities, Holt wrote his next two books, ''The Underachieving School'' (1969) and ''What Do I Do Monday?'' (1970). Both books focused on his belief that schools weren't working and ideas about how they could be better. Holt had determined by this time that the changes he would like to see happen in the school systems were not likely to become a reality. These changes included the relationship between children and the teachers and school community.&lt;ref name="Farenga" /&gt; At this point in the history of education, the free school movement was in full swing, and his next book, ''Freedom and Beyond'' (1972), questioned much of what teachers and educators really meant when they suggested children should have more freedom in the classroom. While Holt was an advocate of children having more rights and abilities to make decisions for themselves, he felt that the free school movement was not the answer to the question of how to fix the school system.

Holt then wrote ''Escape from Childhood: The Needs and Rights of Children'' (1974), in which he claimed that children should have independence including the right to work for money, receive fair and equal treatment, the right to vote, and even the right to choose new parents.&lt;ref name="Lant" /&gt; At the time, his notions of children having so many rights and responsibilities was not very popular, but since then the court systems have seen more and more cases of children attempting to realise many of Holt's suggestions, such as choosing their legal guardian.&lt;ref name="Farenga" /&gt;

Although many of Holt's previous works had discussed the needed reform and failure of the traditional school system, his seventh book, ''Instead of Education: Ways to Help People do Better'' (1976), focused more on his encouragement that parents find legal ways to remove their children from compulsory schools. Specifically, he referred to an Underground Railroad in which schoolchildren could escape the failing school systems of which he had been so critical. The book caused a number of parents to reach out to him regarding their own homeschooling of their children. This correspondence grew so much that he decided to start a newsletter for homeschooling parents. In 1977 ''Growing Without Schooling'' was developed and distributed. It is thought that this newsletter is the first published periodical regarding homeschooling in the United States.&lt;ref name="Farenga" /&gt;

Holt's focus began to switch from critiquing school systems and writing from afar to speaking engagements and educating adults on how they can teach their children while learning themselves. His next book, ''Never Too Late: My Musical Autobiography'' (1978), focused on showing adults that they were not too old to learn new things. This was translated into ways in which parents who had no experience in education could learn to teach their children on their own in a homeschooling setting.

In 1981, the first edition of Holt's most noteworthy book on unschooling, ''Teach Your Own: The John Holt Manual on Homeschooling'', was published. This book, as noted in the first lines of the introduction, is "about ways we can teach children, or rather, allow them to learn, outside of schools—at home, or in whatever other places and situations (and the more the better) we can make available to them. It is in part an argument in favor of doing it, in part a report of the people who are doing it, and in part a manual of action for people who want to do it."&lt;ref&gt;Holt, J., &amp; Patrick, F. (2003). ''Teach Your Own: The John Holt Book Of Homeschooling'' (First Paperback ed.). N.p.: Da Capo Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This manual has since been revised by Holt follower and homeschooling parent Patrick Farenga, and is still distributed today.&lt;ref name="Farenga" /&gt;

Even after Holt's death in 1985, his influence on homeschooling continued through his work. His final book, ''Learning All the Time: How Small Children Begin to Read, Write, Count and Investigate the World, Without Being Taught'', was published posthumously in 1989. It contained a number of his writings for ''Growing Without Schooling''. The ''GWS''' newsletter has since garnered followings in a number of different countries and has been continuously distributed since its inception as a tool for the promotion and encouragement of homeschooling in light of the lack of school system reform.&lt;ref name="Farenga" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3142">Publications of minutes and proceedings, often known as '''journals''',  of legislatures are often kept for record-keeping. Unlike [[government gazette]]s which publish government notices and the like for general public dissemination, journals of these bodies merely records their proceedings and are not necessarily meant for the general public.

==Countries==
===United Kingdom===
The journals of the [[British Parliament|British Houses of Parliament]], alongside the ''[[Hansard]]'', contain an official record of the [[Houses of Parliament]]. The journals are a lengthened account written from the "Votes and Proceedings" (in the [[House of Lords]] called "Minutes of Proceedings"), made day by day by the Clerks at the Table, and printed on the responsibility of the Clerk of the House. In the Commons the Votes and Proceedings, but not the Journal, bear the Speaker's signature in fulfilment of a former order that he should "peruse" them before publication. The journals of the [[British House of Commons]] begin in the first year of the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] in 1547, and are complete, except for a short interval under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Those of the House of Lords date from the first year of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1509. Before that date the proceedings in parliament were entered in the [[Rolls of Parliament]], which extend from 1278 to 1503. The journals of the Lords are "records" in the judicial sense; those of the Commons are not.&lt;ref&gt;(see [[Erskine May, 1st Baron Farnborough|Erskine May]], ''Parliamentary Practice'', 1906, pages 201–202)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hansard'', which is available from 1803, contains printed transcripts of parliamentary debates.

===United States===
The ''[[Congressional Record]]'' is the official record of the proceedings and debates of the [[United States Congress]]. It is published by the [[United States Government Publishing Office]], and is issued when the [[United States]] Congress is in session. Indexes are issued approximately every two weeks. At the end of a session of Congress, the daily editions are compiled in bound volumes constituting the permanent edition.

''[[The City Record]]'' is the official journal of [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Councilman Ben Kallos wants city to publish government notices on its website|first=Erin|last=Durkin|date=26 May 2014|work=[[New York Daily News]]|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/post-city-notices-website-councilman-article-1.1806264}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is published each weekday (except legal holidays) and contains legal notices produced by city agencies, including notices of proposed and adopted rules, [[government procurement|procurement]] solicitations and awards, upcoming public hearings and meetings, public auctions and property dispositions, and selected court decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About DCAS - The City Record|publisher=[[New York City Department of Citywide Administrative Services]]|accessdate=13 June 2014|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/html/about/cityrecord.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detectors used in LWR are usually based on a semiconductor photodetector array, which is typically cryogenically or thermal-electric cooled. Sometimes avalanche photodiodes (APD), photoconductivity, photoelectromagnetic, or photodiffusion devices are used even without cooling.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boselec.com/products/detirlwr.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some devices detect only the main beam of foreign lasers while others detect even scattered rays.

==Early life==

Lester Asheim was born on January 22, 1914 in Spokane, Washington. His family moved to Seattle, which is where he grew up until he went to the [[University of Washington]]. While there he earned two undergraduate degrees, one in English in 1936, and another in [[Librarianship]] in 1937. He also earned his Masters in [[American literature]] in 1941 from the same institution.&lt;ref name=UNC&gt;

When the United States entered [[World War II]], Asheim joined the [[Army Signal Corps]] for three years. After his tour of duty, Asheim attended the [[University of Chicago]]. He earned his Ph.D in Librarianship from the University's graduate program in 1949.&lt;ref name=UNC/&gt;

==Academic life==

Asheims' first faculty position was at the University of Chicago, which started in 1948 while he was still attaining his Ph.D. He became dean in 1952 and held the position until he left the school in 1961. From 1961 until 1971 he held two different positions with the [[American Library Association]] (ALA). His first was Director of International relations until 1966, then he moved on to be the Director of the ALA's office for library education. Asheim left the ALA in 1971 to return to the University of Chicago as a faculty member. In 1975 he accepted a position as a faculty member at the [[University of North Carolina]]. He remained at the School of Information and Library Science until his retirement in 1984.&lt;ref name=UNC/&gt; His papers are archived at the Southern Historical Collection of the Wilson Library on the University of North Carolina at the Chapel Hill campus &lt;ref&gt;Collection Number: 04775. Collection Title: Lester Eugene Asheim Papers, 1940s-1990s. http://www.lib.unc.edu/mss/inv/a/Asheim,Lester_Eugene.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and afterward==

Asheim died on July 1, 1997, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The Library and Science department at the University Of North Carolina has created a scholarship fund in his name.&lt;ref name=UNC/&gt;

==Contribution to library science==
Asheim made some of the most important contributions in Library science through his work on censorship in the library atmosphere. Asheim was an active librarian in a time of great growth in the library science community. His most famous article entitled "[[Not Censorship, But Selection]]"&lt;ref name="ala.org"&gt;

Asheim's article articulated the difference between censorship and selection in several parts that address each of the problems that were associated with collection continuation.  He presents and advocates several rules that librarians should follow in deciding what materials to include and exclude in their libraries' collections.

Asheim's article is still cited by library science community decades later when dealing with the problems of cyber materials. The article "Lester Asheim in Cyberspace: A tribute to Sound reasoning" by June Pinnell-Stephens takes Asheim's arguments and applies them to the cyber age.&lt;ref&gt;

Tensions between the regions of Tripolitania in the west, Cyrenaica in the east, and Fezzan to the south are ever-present. To those is added Tripoli now being under the control of Libyan Dawn, with the newly elected government decamping to the city of Tobruk in Cyrenaica. Some in Cyrenaica think separation is the answer, noting that the region contains two-thirds of the oil of Libya, which holds the largest reserves in Africa. The government itself is determined to reconnect with the rest of the country, but it lacks the armed forces to take back Tripoli, making de-facto partition the present reality."

Libya has been inhabited by [[Berber people|Berbers]] since the late [[Bronze Age]]. The [[Phoenicia]]ns established trading posts in western Libya, and ancient [[Greek colonies|Greek colonists]] established city-states in eastern Libya. Libya was variously ruled by [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egyptians]] and [[Macedonian Empire|Greeks]] before becoming a part of the [[Roman Empire]]. Libya was an [[Early centers of Christianity|early centre of Christianity]]. After the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], the area of Libya was mostly occupied by the [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]] until the 7th century, when [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|invasions]] brought [[Islam]] to the region. In the 16th century, the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Knights of St John]] occupied [[Tripoli]], until [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule [[Ottoman Tripolitania|began in 1551]]. Libya was involved in the [[Barbary Wars]] of the 18th and 19th centuries. Ottoman rule continued until the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] occupation of Libya resulted in the temporary [[Italian Libya]] colony from 1911 to 1943. During the [[Second World War]], Libya was an important area of warfare in the [[North African Campaign]]. The [[Italian settlers in Libya|Italian population]] then went into decline.

[[File:Archaeological Site of Sabratha-108976.jpg|thumb|left|Archaeological Site of Sabratha, Libya]]
The Latin name Libya (from Greek Λιβύη, Libyē) referred to the region west of the Nile generally corresponding to its central location in North Africa historically visited by many Mediterranean cultures which referred to its original inhabitants as the "Libúē." The name ''Libya'' was introduced in 1934 for [[Italian Libya]], reviving the historical name for [[Northwest Africa]], from the [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|Λιβύη}} (''{{transl|grc|Libúē}}'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tafsuit.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=91:preservation-of-the-libyan-culture&amp;catid=37:news |title=Preservation of the Libyan culture |publisher=Tafsuit.com |date=6 June 2011 |accessdate=23 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501035247/http://www.tafsuit.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=91:preservation-of-the-libyan-culture&amp;catid=37:news |archivedate=1 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to supplant terms applied to [[Ottoman Tripolitania]], the coastal region of what is today Libya having been ruled by the Ottoman Empire from 1551 to 1911, as the Eyalet of Tripolitania. The name "Libya" was brought back into use in 1903 by Italian geographer Federico Minutilli.&lt;ref name="be177"&gt;"Bibliografia della Libia"; [[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Libya gained independence in 1951 as the [[Kingdom of Libya|United Libyan Kingdom]] ({{lang-ar|المملكة الليبية المتحدة}} ''{{transl|ar|al-Mamlakah al-Lībiyyah al-Muttaḥidah}}''), changing its name to the Kingdom of Libya ({{lang-ar|المملكة الليبية}} ''{{transl|ar|al-Mamlakah al-Lībiyyah}}'') in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ben Cahoon |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Libya.htm |title=Libya |publisher=Worldstatesmen.org |accessdate=28 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124140429/http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Libya.htm |archivedate=24 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a [[coup d'état]] led by [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in 1969, the name of the state was changed to the Libyan Arab Republic ({{lang-ar|الجمهورية العربية الليبية}} ''{{transl|ar|al-Jumhūriyyah al-‘Arabiyyah al-Lībiyyah}}'').

The coastal plain of Libya was inhabited by [[Neolithic]] peoples from as early as 8000 BC. The [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] ancestors of the [[Berber people]] are assumed to have spread into the area by the [[Late Bronze Age]]. The earliest known name of such a tribe was the [[Garamantes]], based in [[Germa]].

In 525 BC the [[Persian people|Persian]] army of [[Cambyses II]] overran Cyrenaica, which for the next two centuries remained under Persian or Egyptian rule. [[Alexander the Great]] was greeted by the Greeks when he entered Cyrenaica in 331 BC, and Eastern Libya again fell under the control of the Greeks, this time as part of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]].

After the fall of [[Carthage]] the Romans did not immediately occupy [[Tripolitania]] (the region around Tripoli), but left it instead under control of the kings of [[Numidia]], until the coastal cities asked and obtained its protection.&lt;ref name="be202"&gt;[[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy Apion]], the last Greek ruler, bequeathed Cyrenaica to Rome, which formally annexed the region in 74 BC and joined it to Crete as [[Creta et Cyrenaica|a Roman province]]. As part of the [[Africa Nova]] province, Tripolitania was prosperous,&lt;ref name="be202" /&gt; and reached a golden age in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, when the city of [[Leptis Magna]], home to the [[Severan dynasty]], was at its height.&lt;ref name="be202" /&gt;

On the Eastern side, Cyrenaica's first Christian communities were established by the time of the Emperor [[Claudius]].&lt;ref name="be417"&gt;[[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; It was heavily devastated during the [[Kitos War]]&lt;ref name="ro364"&gt;{{cite book |ref=Rostovtzeff|last=Rostovtzeff|first=Michael|title=Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire|location=Oxford|year=1957|edition=2|publisher=Clarendon|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; and almost depopulated of Greeks and Jews alike.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], lxviii. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Although repopulated by [[Trajan]] with military colonies,&lt;ref name="ro364" /&gt; from then started its decline.&lt;ref name="be417" /&gt; Libya was early to convert to [[Nicene Christianity]] and was the home of [[Pope Victor I]]; however, Libya was a hotbed for early heresies such as [[Arianism]] and [[Donatism]].

{{Special characters}}
The decline of the [[Roman Empire]] saw the classical cities fall into ruin, a process hastened by the [[Vandals]]' destructive sweep through North Africa in the 5th century. When the Empire returned (now as [[Byzantine Empire|East Romans]]) as part of [[Justinian]]'s reconquests of the 6th century, efforts were made to strengthen the old cities, but it was only a last gasp before they collapsed into disuse. Cyrenaica, which had remained an outpost of the [[Byzantine Empire]] during the Vandal period, also took on the characteristics of an armed camp. Unpopular Byzantine governors imposed burdensome taxation to meet military costs, while the towns and public services—including the water system—were left to decay. By the beginning of the 7th century, Byzantine control over the region was weak, Berber rebellions were becoming more frequent, and there was little to oppose [[Early Muslim conquests|Muslim]] invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Rodd, Francis (1925).

For the next several decades, Libya was under the purview of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Caliph of Damascus]] until the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] overthrew the Umayyads in 750, and Libya came under the rule of Baghdad. When Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] appointed [[Ibrahim I ibn al-Aghlab|Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab]] as his governor of [[Ifriqiya]] in 800, Libya enjoyed considerable local autonomy under the [[Aghlabid]] dynasty. By the 10th century, the Shiite [[Fatimids]] controlled Western Libya, and ruled the entire region in 972 and appointed [[Bologhine ibn Ziri]] as governor.&lt;ref name="be202" /&gt;

Ibn Ziri's Berber [[Zirid dynasty]] ultimately broke away from the Shiite Fatimids, and recognised the Sunni Abbasids of Baghdad as rightful Caliphs. In retaliation, the Fatimids brought about the migration of thousands from mainly two Arab Qaisi tribes, the [[Banu Sulaym]] and [[Banu Hilal]] to North Africa. This act drastically altered the fabric of the Libyan countryside, and cemented the cultural and linguistic Arabisation of the region.&lt;ref name="be202" /&gt;

Zirid rule in Tripolitania was short-lived though, and already in 1001 the Berbers of the [[Banu Khazrun]] broke away. Tripolitania remained under their control until 1146, when the region was overtaken by the [[Normans of Sicily]].&lt;ref name="be203"&gt;[[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1159 that the Moroccan [[Almohad]] leader [[Abd al-Mu'min]] reconquered Tripoli from European rule. For the next 50 years, Tripolitania was the scene of numerous battles among [[Ayyubids]], the Almohad rulers and insurgents of the [[Banu Ghaniya]]. Later, a general of the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]], Muhammad ibn Abu Hafs, ruled Libya from 1207 to 1221 before the later establishment of a Tunisian [[Hafsid dynasty]]&lt;ref name="be203" /&gt; independent from the Almohads. The Hafsids ruled Tripolitania for nearly 300 years. By the 16th century the Hafsids became increasingly caught up in the power struggle between Spain and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

After weakening control of Abbasids, Cyrenaica was under Egypt based states such as [[Tulunids]], [[Ikhshidids]], [[Ayyubids]] and [[Mamluks]] before Ottoman conquest in 1517. Finally [[Fezzan]] acquired independence under Awlad Muhammad dynasty after [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]] rule. Ottomans finally conquered Fezzan between 1556 and 1577.

===Ottoman Tripolitania (1551–1911)===
{{Main article|Ottoman Tripolitania}}
[[File:Capture of Tripoli by the Ottomans 1551.jpg|thumb|The [[Siege of Tripoli (1551)|Siege of Tripoli]] in 1551 allowed the Ottomans to capture the city from the Knights of St. John.]]

After a successful invasion of Tripoli by [[Habsburg Spain]] in 1510,&lt;ref name="be203" /&gt; and its handover to the [[Knights of St. John]], the Ottoman admiral [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] took control of Libya in 1551.&lt;ref name="be203" /&gt; His successor [[Turgut Reis]] was named the [[Bey]] of Tripoli and later [[Pasha of Tripoli]] in 1556. By 1565, administrative authority as regent in Tripoli was vested in a ''[[pasha]]'' appointed directly by the ''[[sultan]]'' in [[Constantinople]]/[[Istanbul]]. In the 1580s, the rulers of [[Fezzan]] gave their allegiance to the sultan, and although Ottoman authority was absent in [[Cyrenaica]], a ''bey'' was stationed in Benghazi late in the next century to act as agent of the government in Tripoli.&lt;ref name="be417" /&gt; European [[Barbary slave trade|slaves]] and large numbers of enslaved Blacks transported from Sudan were also a feature of everyday life in Tripoli. In 1551, [[Turgut Reis]] enslaved almost the entire population of the Maltese island of [[Gozo]], some 6,300 people, sending them to Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert C. Davis|title=Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy, 1500–1800|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5q9zcB3JS40C|accessdate=31 May 2012|date=5 December 2003|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-333-71966-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2016}}

In time, real power came to rest with the pasha’s corps of [[janissaries]].&lt;ref name="be203" /&gt; In 1611 the ''[[dey]]s'' staged a coup against the pasha, and Dey Sulayman Safar was appointed as head of government. For the next hundred years, a series of ''deys'' effectively ruled Tripolitania. The two most important Deys were [[Mehmed Saqizli]] (r. 1631–49) and [[Osman Saqizli]] (r. 1649–72), both also Pasha, who ruled effectively the region.&lt;ref name="be204"&gt;[[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter conquered also Cyrenaica.&lt;ref name="be204" /&gt;

[[File:EnterpriseTripoli.jpg|thumb|left|The USS ''[[USS Enterprise (1799)|Enterprise]]'' of the [[Mediterranean Squadron (United States)|Mediterranean Squadron]] capturing a Tripolitan Corsair during the [[First Barbary War]], 1801]]
Lacking direction from the Ottoman government, Tripoli lapsed into a period of military anarchy during which coup followed coup and few deys survived in office more than a year. One such coup was led by Turkish officer [[Ahmed Karamanli]].&lt;ref name="be204" /&gt; The [[Karamanli dynasty|Karamanlis]] ruled from 1711 until 1835 mainly in Tripolitania, and had influence in Cyrenaica and Fezzan as well by the mid-18th century. Ahmad's successors proved to be less capable than himself, however, the region's delicate balance of power allowed the Karamanli. The [[1793–95 Tripolitanian civil war]] occurred in those years. In 1793, [[Turkey|Turkish]] officer Ali Benghul deposed Hamet Karamanli and briefly restored Tripolitania to Ottoman rule. Hamet's brother [[Yusuf Karamanli|Yusuf]] (r. 1795–1832) re-established Tripolitania's independence.

In the early 19th century war broke out between the United States and Tripolitania, and a series of battles ensued in what came to be known as the [[First Barbary War]] and the [[Second Barbary War]]. By 1819, the various treaties of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] had forced the Barbary states to give up piracy almost entirely, and Tripolitania's economy began to crumble. As Yusuf weakened, factions sprung up around his three sons. Civil war soon resulted.&lt;ref name="be205"&gt;[[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]] sent in troops ostensibly to restore order, marking the end of both the Karamanli dynasty and an independent Tripolitania.&lt;ref name="be205"/&gt; Order was not recovered easily, and the revolt of the Libyan under Abd-El-Gelil and Gûma ben Khalifa lasted until the death of the latter in 1858.&lt;ref name="be205" /&gt; The second period of direct Ottoman rule saw administrative changes, and greater order in the governance of the three provinces of Libya. Ottoman rule finally reasserted to Fezzan between 1850 and 1875 for earning income from Saharan commerce.

===Italian Libya (1911–1943)===

From 1927 to 1934, the territory was split into two colonies, [[Italian Cyrenaica]] and [[Italian Tripolitania]], run by Italian governors. Some 150,000 Italians settled in Libya, constituting roughly 20% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-46562/Libya |title=Libya |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Grrb1AAQ?url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/339574/Libya |archivedate=25 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Italy adopted the name "Libya" (used by the Ancient Greeks for all of [[North Africa]], except Egypt) as the official name of the colony (made up of the three provinces of [[Cyrenaica]], [[Tripolitania]] and [[Fezzan]]). [[Omar Mukhtar]] was the resistance leader against the Italian colonization and became a national hero despite his capture and execution on 16 September 1931. His face is currently printed on the Libyan ten dinar note in memory and recognition of his patriotism.
Idris al-Mahdi as-Senussi (later [[Idris of Libya|King Idris I]]), Emir of Cyrenaica, led the Libyan resistance to Italian occupation between the two world wars. [[Ilan Pappé]] estimates that between 1928 and 1932 the Italian military "killed half the Bedouin population (directly or through disease and starvation in camps)."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilan Pappé]], ''The Modern Middle East.''

The discovery of significant [[oil reserves]] in 1959 and the subsequent income from [[petroleum]] sales enabled one of the world's poorest nations to establish an extremely wealthy state.

Gaddafi also wanted to combat the strict social restrictions that had been imposed on women by the previous regime, establishing the Revolutionary Women's Formation to encourage reform. In 1970, a law was introduced affirming equality of the sexes and insisting on wage parity. In 1971, Gaddafi sponsored the creation of a Libyan General Women's Federation. In 1972, a law was passed criminalizing the marriage of any females under the age of sixteen and ensuring that a woman's consent was a necessary prerequisite for a marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Bearman, Jonathan (1986).

In January 2015, meetings were held with the aim to find a peaceful agreement between the rival parties in Libya. The so-called Geneva-Ghadames talks were supposed to bring the GNC and the Tobruk government together at one table to find a solution of the internal conflict. However, the GNC actually never participated, a sign that internal division not only affected the "Tobruk Camp", but also the "Tripoli Camp". Meanwhile, terrorism within Libya has steadily increased, affecting also neighbouring countries. The [[Bardo National Museum attack|terrorist attack against the Bardo Museum]] on 18 March 2015, was reportedly carried on by two Libyan-trained militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fanack|title=Terrorism Increases in Libya as Politicians Talk|url=https://chronicle.fanack.com/libya/history-past-to-present/terrorism-increases-in-libya/|website=Fanack.com|accessdate=13 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082502/https://chronicle.fanack.com/libya/history-past-to-present/terrorism-increases-in-libya/|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 SRSG Leon reported to the UN Security Council  on the progress of the negotiations, which at that point had just achieved a political agreement on 11 July setting out "a comprehensive framework…includ[ing] guiding principles…institutions and decision-making mechanisms to guide the transition until the adoption of a permanent constitution."  The stated purpose of that process was "…intended to culminate in the creation of a modern, democratic state based on the principle of inclusion, the rule of law, separation of powers and respect for human rights." The SRSG praised the participants for achieving agreement, stating that "The Libyan people have unequivocally expressed themselves in favour of peace."  The SRSG then informed the Security Council that "Libya is at a critical stage" and urging "all parties in Libya to continue to engage constructively in the dialogue process", stating that "only through dialogue and political compromise, can a peaceful resolution of the conflict be achieved. A peaceful transition will only succeed in Libya through a significant and coordinated effort in supporting a future Government of National Accord…".
Talks, negotiations and dialogue continued on during mid-2015 at various international locations, culminating at Skhirat in Morocco in early September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/undpa/speeches-statements/15072015/libya |title=15 July 2015, Security Council briefing on the situation in Libya, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Libya Bernardino Leon &amp;#124; Department of Political Affairs |website=Un.org |date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=1 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023061451/http://www.un.org/undpa/speeches-statements/15072015/libya |archivedate=23 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Miles |first=Tom |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/05/us-libya-security-talks-idUSKCN0R428N20150905 |title=U.N. sees Libya talks entering final mile, eyes Sept. 20 deal |publisher=Reuters |date=4 September 2015 |accessdate=1 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023060912/http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/05/us-libya-security-talks-idUSKCN0R428N20150905 |archivedate=23 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libya extends over {{convert|1759540|km2|sqmi|0}}, making it the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|16th largest nation in the world by size]]. Libya is bound to the north by the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the west by [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]], the southwest by [[Niger]], the south by [[Chad]], the southeast by [[Sudan]], and the east by [[Egypt]].

Natural hazards come in the form of hot, dry, dust-laden [[sirocco]] (known in Libya as the ''gibli''). This is a southern wind blowing from one to four days in spring and autumn. There are also [[dust storm]]s and [[Dust storm|sandstorms]]. [[Oasis|Oases]] can also be found scattered throughout Libya, the most important of which are [[Ghadames]] and [[Kufra]].&lt;ref name="WorldCulturalHeritage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Town of Ghadames (1986) Libyan Arab Jamahirya|url=http://heindorffhus.motivsamler.dk/worldheritage/frame-LibyaGhadames.htm|website=World Cultural Heritage|accessdate=10 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810022226/http://heindorffhus.motivsamler.dk/worldheritage/frame-LibyaGhadames.htm|archivedate=10 August 2016 |date=20 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libya is one of the sunniest and driest countries in the world due to prevailing presence of desert environment.

===Libyan Desert===
[[File:Libyan Dessert.jpg|thumb|Libya is a predominantly desert country. Up to 90% of the land area is covered in desert.]]
The [[Libyan Desert]], which covers much of Libya, is one of the most arid and sun-baked places on earth.&lt;ref name="SalakLibya" /&gt; In places, decades may pass without seeing any rainfall at all, and even in the [[highland (geography)|highlands]] rainfall seldom happens, once every 5–10 years.

Likewise, the temperature in the Libyan Desert can be extreme; on 13 September 1922, the town of [['Aziziya]], which is located southwest of [[Tripoli]], recorded an air temperature of {{convert|58|°C|°F|1|lk=on}}, considered to be a world record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.extremescience.com/hottest.htm |title=How Hot is Hot? |publisher=Extreme Science |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202020747/http://www.extremescience.com/hottest.htm |archivedate=2 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Death_Valley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wmo.asu.edu/world-highest-temperature |title=World: Highest Temperature |accessdate=15 January 2013 |year=2012 |work=World Weather / Climate Extremes Archive |publisher=Arizona State University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104143844/http://wmo.asu.edu/world-highest-temperature |archivedate= 4 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=El_Azizia&gt;{{cite journal|last=El Fadli|first=KI|title=World Meteorological Organization Assessment of the Purported World Record 58°C Temperature Extreme at El Azizia, Libya (13 September 1922)|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|date=September 2012|doi=10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00093.1|volume=94|issue=2|page=199|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2013BAMS...94..199E}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, however, the world record figure of 58&amp;nbsp;°C was overturned by the [[World Meteorological Organization]].&lt;ref name="Death_Valley"/&gt;&lt;ref name=El_Azizia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Westcott |first=Tom |title=Libya loses 'world's hottest place' record |url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/09/15/libya-loses-worlds-hottest-place-record/ |work=Libya Herald |date=15 September 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820231702/http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/09/15/libya-loses-worlds-hottest-place-record/ |archivedate=20 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few scattered uninhabited small oases, usually linked to the major depressions, where water can be found by digging to a few feet in depth. In the west there is a widely dispersed group of oases in unconnected shallow depressions, the Kufra group, consisting of Tazerbo, Rebianae and [[Kufra]].&lt;ref name="Libdesert" /&gt; Aside from the scarps, the general flatness is only interrupted by a series of [[plateau]]s and massifs near the centre of the Libyan Desert, around the convergence of the Egyptian-Sudanese-Libyan borders.

Slightly further to the south are the [[massif]]s of Arkenu, Uweinat, and Kissu. These [[granite]] mountains are ancient, having formed long before the sandstones surrounding them. Arkenu and Western Uweinat are ring complexes very similar to those in the [[Aïr Mountains]]. Eastern Uweinat (the highest point in the Libyan Desert) is a raised sandstone plateau adjacent to the granite part further west.&lt;ref name="Libdesert" /&gt;

The plain to the north of Uweinat is dotted with eroded volcanic features. With the discovery of oil in the 1950s also came the discovery of a massive [[aquifer]] underneath much of Libya.

Libya's foreign policies have fluctuated since 1951. As a Kingdom, Libya maintained a definitively pro-Western stance, and was recognized as belonging to the conservative traditionalist bloc in the League of Arab States (the present-day [[Arab League]]), of which it became a member in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ly0036) |title=Independent Libya |publisher=Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120922002614/lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ly0036) |archivedate=22 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government was also friendly towards Western countries such as the United Kingdom, United States, [[French Fifth Republic|France]], [[First Italian Republic|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]], and established full diplomatic relations with the [[Soviet Union]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zoubir|first=Yahia|year=2009|title=Libya and Europe: Economic Realism at the Rescue of the Qaddafi Authoritarian Regime|journal=Journal of Contemporary European Studies|volume=17|issue=3|pages=401–415|doi=10.1080/14782800903339354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the government supported Arab causes, including the Moroccan and Algerian independence movements, it took little active part in the [[Arab-Israeli dispute]] or the tumultuous inter-Arab politics of the 1950s and early 1960s. The Kingdom was noted for its close association with the West, while it steered a conservative course at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.unb.ca/Texts/JCS/bin/get7.cgi?directory=Fall00/&amp;filename=Abadi.htm |title=Pragmatism and Rhetoric in Libya's Policy Toward Israel |author=Abadi, Jacob |publisher=The Journal of Conflict Studies: Volume XX Number 1 Fall 2000, University of New Brunswick |year=2000 |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330001903/http://www.lib.unb.ca/Texts/JCS/bin/get7.cgi?directory=Fall00%2F&amp;filename=Abadi.htm |archivedate=30 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ninety percent of the people live in less than 10% of the area, primarily along the coast. About 88% of the population is urban, mostly concentrated in the three largest cities, [[Tripoli]], [[Benghazi]] and [[Misrata]]. Libya has a population of about {{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Libya}}|R}}/1e6 round 1}} million,{{UN_Population|ref}} 27.7% of whom are under the age of 15.&lt;ref name="spooks"/&gt; In 1984 the population was 3.6 million, an increase from the 1.54 million reported in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/libya/ |title=Libya |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826090114/http://countrystudies.us/libya/ |archivedate=26 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the Libyan population is today identified as [[Arab]], that is, [[Arabic]]-speaking and Arab-cultured. However, according to DNA studies, 90% of that Arab Libyan population consists in fact of [[Arabized Berber]]s,&lt;ref name="Temehu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.temehu.com/Libyan-People.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711061330/http://www.temehu.com/Libyan-People.htm |archivedate=11 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }} Temehu.

Family life is important for Libyan families, the majority of which live in [[Tower block|apartment blocks]] and other independent housing units, with precise modes of housing depending on their income and wealth.

===Local demographics and ethnic groups===
The original inhabitants of Libya belonged predominantly to various [[Berber people|Berber]] ethnic groups; however, the long series of foreign invasions&amp;nbsp;– particularly by [[Arab people|Arabs]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]]&amp;nbsp;– have had a profound and lasting linguistic, cultural, and identity influence on Libya's demographics.

Today, the great majority of Libya’s inhabitants are Arabic-speaking Muslims of mixed descent, with many also tracing their ancestry to the Banu Sulaym tribe, beside Turkish and purely Berber ethnicities. The [[Turks in Libya|Turkish minority]] are often called "[[Kouloughlis]]" and are concentrated in and around villages and towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |year=2012 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/339574/Libya/46542/Climate#toc46545 |title=Libya |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122084039/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/339574/Libya/46542/Climate#toc46545 |archivedate=22 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there are some Libyan ethnic minorities, such as the purely Berber [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and the [[Toubou people|Tebou]].&lt;ref name="Dupree 1958 loc=33-44"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dupree|first=Louis|year=1958|title=The Non-Arab Ethnic Groups of Libya|journal=Middle East Journal|volume=12|issue=1|pages=33–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, Libya has been a host state for millions of low- and high-skilled Egyptian migrants, in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tsourapas|first1=Gerasimos|title=The Politics of Egyptian Migration to Libya|url=http://www.merip.org/mero/mero031715|website=Middle East Research and Information Project|accessdate=4 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111193445/http://www.merip.org/mero/mero031715|archivedate=11 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to estimate the total number of immigrants in Libya as there are often differences between census figures, official counts and usually more accurate unofficial estimates. In the 2006 census, around 359,540 foreign nationals were resident in Libya out of a population of over 5.5 million (6.35% of the population). Almost half of these were Egyptians, followed by Sudanese and Palestinian immigrants.&lt;ref name="EU migrant policy Centre"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.migrationpolicycentre.eu/docs/fact_sheets/Factsheet%20Libya.pdf |format=PDF |title=Migration Facts Libya |website=Migrationpolicycentre.eu |accessdate=1 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040540/http://www.migrationpolicycentre.eu/docs/fact_sheets/Factsheet%20Libya.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the 2011 revolution, 768,362 immigrants fled Libya as calculated by the [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], around 13% of the population at the time, although many more stayed on in the country.&lt;ref name="EU migrant policy Centre"/&gt;

If consular records prior to the revolution are used to estimate the immigrant population, as many as 2 million Egyptian migrants were recorded by the Egyptian embassy in Tripoli in 2009, followed by 87,200 Tunisians, and 68,200 Moroccans by their respective embassies. The number of Asian migrants before the revolution were roughly 100,000 (60,000 Bangladeshis, 18,000 Indians, 10,000 Pakistanis, 8000 Filipinos as well as Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai and other workers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/more.php?id=3685 |title=Libya, Tunisia: Migrants – Migration News &amp;#124; Migration Dialogue |website=Migration.ucdavis.edu |date= |accessdate=1 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305132553/https://migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/more.php?id=3685 |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would put the immigrant population at almost 40% before the revolution and is a figure more consistent with government estimates in 2004 which put the regular and irregular migrant numbers at 1.35 to 1.8 million (25–33% of the population at the time).&lt;ref name="EU migrant policy Centre"/&gt;

Libya's native population of Arabs-Berbers as well as Arab migrants of various nationalities collectively make up 97% of the population {{As of|2014|lc=y}}. The remaining 3% of residents include mostly [[Bangladeshies]], [[Greek people|Greeks]], [[Indian people|Indians]], [[Italian people|Italians]], [[Maltese people|Maltese]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], and [[Ukrainians]] as well as other nationalities.&lt;ref name="Cfbly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Libya|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ly.html|publisher=CIA|accessdate=16 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224023634/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ly.html|archivedate=24 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1930s, the [[Senussi]] Sunni Sufi movement was the primary Islamic movement in Libya. This was a religious revival adapted to desert life. Its ''zawaaya'' (lodges) were found in [[Tripolitania]] and [[Fezzan]], but Senussi influence was strongest in [[Cyrenaica]]. Rescuing the region from unrest and anarchy, the Senussi movement gave the Cyrenaican tribal people a religious attachment and feelings of unity and purpose.&lt;ref name="senussi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ly0065) |title=The Sanusis |publisher=Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921235348/lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ly0065) |archivedate=21 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This Islamic movement, which was eventually destroyed by both [[Italo-Turkish War|Italian invasion]] and later the Gaddafi government,&lt;ref name="senussi" /&gt; was very conservative and somewhat different from the Islam that exists in Libya today. Gaddafi asserted that he was a devout Muslim, and his government was taking a role in supporting Islamic institutions and in worldwide proselytising on behalf of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ly0066) |title=Islam in Revolutionary Libya |publisher=Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921235348/lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ly0066) |archivedate=21 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are small foreign communities of [[Christian]]s. [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Christianity]], which is the Christian Church of Egypt, is the [[Coptic Orthodox Church in Africa#Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco|largest and most historical Christian denomination in Libya]]. There are about 60,000 Egyptian [[Copt]]s in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamopediaonline.org/country-profile/libya/religious-minorities/christian-communities |title=Christian Communities |publisher=Islamopedia Online |date= |accessdate=1 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326235402/http://www.islamopediaonline.org/country-profile/libya/religious-minorities/christian-communities |archivedate=26 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Copts in Libya are Egyptian.

The Coptic Church has grown in recent years in Libya, due to the growing immigration of Egyptian Copts to Libya. As all followers of Christianity in Libya are foreigners who came to the country under work permits. There are an estimated 40,000 [[Roman Catholic]]s in Libya who are served by two Bishops, one in Tripoli (serving the [[Italian people|Italian]] community) and one in [[Benghazi]] (serving the [[Maltese people|Maltese]] community). There is also a small [[Anglican]] community, made up mostly of African immigrant workers in Tripoli; it is part of the [[Anglican Diocese of Egypt]].

In Giado some 500 Jews died of weakness, hunger, and disease. In 1942, Jews who were not in the concentration camps were heavily restricted in their economic activity and all men between 18 and 45 years were drafted for forced labor. In August 1942, Jews from Tripolitania were interned in a concentration camp at Sidi Azaz.

Many Arabic speaking Libyans consider themselves as part of a wider Arab community. This was strengthened by the spread of Pan-Arabism in the mid-20th century, and their reach to power in Libya where they instituted Arabic as the only official language of the state. Under their dictatorship the teaching and even use of indigenous [[Berber languages|Tamazight]] language was strictly forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-16289543|title=After Gaddafi, Libya's Amazigh demand recognition|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232407/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-16289543|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to banning foreign languages previously taught in academic institutions, leaving entire generations of Libyans with limitations in their comprehension of the English language.

Libyans have a heritage in the traditions of the previously nomadic [[Bedouin]] Arabic speakers and sedentary [[Berbers|Amazigh]] tribes.

===Cuisine===
{{main article|Libyan cuisine}}
Libyan cuisine is a mixture of the different [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], Bedouin and traditional Arab culinary influences.&lt;ref name="libyafacts3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://looklex.com/libya/z_eatandsleep.htm |title=Libya – Eat and Sleep |publisher=Looklex.com |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205072554/http://looklex.com/libya/z_eatandsleep.htm |archivedate=5 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pasta]] is the staple food in the Western side of Libya, whereas [[rice]] is generally the staple food in the east.

Common Libyan foods include several variations of red (tomato) sauce based pasta dishes (similar to the Italian [[Arrabbiata sauce|Sugo all'arrabbiata]] dish); rice, usually served with lamb or chicken (typically stewed, fried, grilled, or boiled in-sauce); and [[couscous]], which is steam cooked whilst held over boiling red (tomato) sauce and meat (sometimes also containing courgettes/zucchini and chickpeas), which is typically served along with cucumber slices, lettuce and olives.

[[Bazeen]], a dish made from barley flour and served with red tomato sauce, is customarily eaten communally, with several people sharing the same dish, usually by hand. This dish is commonly served at traditional weddings or festivities. [[Asida]] is a sweet version of Bazeen, made from white flour and served with a mix of honey, ghee or butter. Another favorite way to serve Asida is with [[Rub (syrup)|rub]] (fresh date syrup) and olive oil. [[Usban]] is animal tripe stitched and stuffed with rice and vegetables cooked in tomato based soup or steamed. [[Chorba|Shurba]] is a red tomato sauce-based soup, usually served with small grains of pasta.&lt;ref name="libyafacts3" /&gt;

A very common snack eaten by Libyans is known as ''khubs bi' tun'', literally meaning "bread with tuna fish", usually served as a baked baguette or pita bread stuffed with tuna fish that has been mixed with [[harissa]] (chili sauce) and olive oil.

Dates are harvested, dried and can be eaten as they are, made into syrup or slightly fried and eaten with [[bsisa]] and milk. After eating, Libyans often drink black tea. This is normally repeated a second time (for the second glass of tea), and in the third round of tea, it is served with roasted [[peanut]]s or roasted [[almond]]s known as ''shay bi'l-luz'' (mixed with the tea in the same glass).&lt;ref name="Libyan Food" /&gt;

The '''May 1958 crisis''' (or '''Algiers putsch''' or '''the coup of 13 May''') was a political crisis in [[France]] during the turmoil of the [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954–62) which led to collapse of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] and its replacement by the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] led by [[Charles de Gaulle]] who returned to power after a twelve-year absence. It started as a political uprising in [[Algiers]] on 13 May 1958 and then became a military [[Coup d'état|coup d'état]] led by a coalition headed by [[député|Algiers deputy]] and reserve airborne officer [[Pierre Lagaillarde]], French Generals [[Raoul Salan]], [[Edmond Jouhaud]], Jean Gracieux, and [[Jacques Massu]], and by Admiral [[Philippe Auboyneau]], commander of the Mediterranean fleet. The coup was supported by former Algerian Governor General [[Jacques Soustelle]] and his activist allies.

The coup had as its aim to oppose the formation of [[Pierre Pflimlin]]'s new government and to impose a change of policies in favor of the right-wing partisans of [[French Algeria]].

== Context ==
Recurrent cabinet crises focused attention on the inherent instability of the Fourth Republic and increased the misgivings of the [[French Army]] and of the [[Pieds-noirs]] (European Algerians) that the security of [[French Algeria]], an [[overseas department]] of France was being undermined by party politics. Army commanders chafed at what they took to be inadequate and incompetent government support of military efforts to end the war. The feeling was widespread that another debacle like that of [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Indochina in 1954]] was in the offing and that the government would order another precipitated pullout and sacrifice French honor to political expediency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27243803|title=Dien Bien Phu: Did the US offer France an A-bomb?|magazine=BBC news magazine|date=5 May 2014 |accessdate =5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the return of [[Charles de Gaulle]].

== The coup ==
After his tour as governor general, [[Jacques Soustelle]] had returned to France to organize support for de Gaulle's return to power, while retaining close ties to the army and the settlers. By early 1958, he had organized a coup d'état, bringing together dissident army officers and colonial officials with sympathetic [[Gaullist]]s. On 13 May right-wing elements seized power in Algiers and called for a Government of Public Safety under General [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]. Massu became chairman of the Public Safety Committee and one of the leaders of the revolt.&lt;ref name=Fenby&gt;{{cite book|last=Jonathan|first=Fenby|title=The General Charles de Gaulle and the France he saved|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2010|isbn=9781847394101|page=383-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[General Salan]] assumed leadership of a [[Committee of Public Safety]]&lt;ref&gt;The term "[[Committee of Public Safety]]" recalls the body of that name which acted as the [[de facto]] executive government in France during the [[Reign of Terror]] (1793–94), a stage of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;/ref&gt; formed to replace the civil authority and pressed the [[Military junta|junta]]'s demands that de Gaulle be named by French president [[René Coty]] to head a government of national union invested with extraordinary powers to prevent the "abandonment of Algeria." Salan announced on radio that the Army had “provisionally taken over responsibility for the destiny of French Algeria”. Under the pressure of Massu, Salan declared ''Vive de Gaulle!'' from the balcony of the Algiers Government-General building on 15 May. De Gaulle answered two days later that he was ready to “assume the powers of the Republic”.&lt;ref&gt;French: ''« prêt à assumer les pouvoirs de la République »''&lt;/ref&gt; Many worried as they saw this answer as support for the army.&lt;ref name=Fenby/&gt;{{rp|373-416}}

At a 19 May press conference, de Gaulle asserted again that he was at the disposal of the country. When  a journalist expressed the concerns of some who feared that he would violate civil liberties, de Gaulle retorted vehemently:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Have I ever done that? Quite the opposite, I have reestablished them when they had disappeared. Who honestly believes that, at age 67, I would start a career as a dictator?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 24 May, French [[paratrooper]]s from the Algeria landed on [[Corsica]] by aircraft, taking the French island in a bloodless action called "[[Opération Corse]]." Subsequently, preparations were made in Algeria for "[[Operation Resurrection]]," which had as objectives the seizure of Paris and the removal of the French government, through the use of paratroopers and armoured forces based at [[Rambouillet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crozier |first=Brian |author2=Mansell, Gerard |date=July 1960 |title=France and Algeria |journal=[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]] |volume=36 |issue=3 |page=310 |doi=10.2307/2610008 |jstor= 2610008|quote= |publisher=Blackwell Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Operation Resurrection" was to be implemented if one of three scenarios occurred: if de Gaulle was not approved as leader of France by Parliament, if de Gaulle asked for military assistance to take power, or if it seemed that the [[French Communist Party]] was making any move to take power in France.&lt;ref&gt; Daniel Gagnon,  "Algeria, De Gaulle, and the Birth of the French Fifth Republic." (Providence College History Student Papers. Paper 15.
2014) [http://digitalcommons.providence.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=history_students online]. &lt;/ref&gt;

Political leaders on many sides agreed to support the General's return to power with the notable exceptions of [[François Mitterrand]], who was a minister in [[Guy Mollet]]'s Socialist government, [[Pierre Mendès-France]] (a Young Turk of the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]], former Prime Minister), [[Alain Savary]] (also a member of the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO)), and the Communist Party. The far-left philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], a noted atheist, said, “I would rather vote for God,” as he would at least be more modest than de Gaulle. Mendès-France and Savary, opposed to their respective parties' support of de Gaulle, would form together, in 1960, the ''Parti socialiste autonome'' (PSA, Socialist Autonomous Party), ancestor of the ''[[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Parti socialiste unifié]]'' (PSU, Unified Socialist Party).&lt;ref&gt;Philip Thody, ''The Fifth French Republic: Presidents, Politics and Personalities'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

== De Gaulle's return to power (29 May 1958) ==
On 29 May President René Coty told parliament that the nation was on the brink of civil war, so he was 'turning towards the most illustrious of Frenchmen, towards the man who, in the darkest years of our history, was our chief for the reconquest of freedom and who refused dictatorship in order to re-establish the Republic. I ask General de Gaulle to confer with the head of state and to examine with him what, in the framework of Republican legality, is necessary for the immediate formation of a government of national safety and what can be done, in a fairly short time, for a deep reform of our institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Fenby|title=The General|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzVrCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA396|year=2013|page=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle accepted Coty's proposal under the precondition that a new constitution would be introduced creating a powerful presidency in which a sole executive, the first of which was to be himself, ruled for seven-year periods. Another condition was that he be granted [[state of emergency|extraordinary powers]] for a period of six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. Scott Haine|title=The History of France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=264Hs4cveOUC&amp;pg=PA180|year=2000|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle's newly formed cabinet was approved by the National Assembly on 1 June 1958, by 329 votes against 224, while he was granted the power to govern by [[Ordonnance (French constitutional law)|ordinances]] for a six-month period as well as the task to draft a new Constitution.

The May 1958 crisis indicated that the Fourth Republic by 1958 no longer had any support from the French army in Algeria, and was at its mercy even in civilian political matters. This decisive shift in the balance of power in civil-military relations in France in 1958 and the threat of force was the main immediate factor in the return of de Gaulle to power in France.

== The new constitution ==
{{See|Fifth French Republic|Constitution of France}}
De Gaulle blamed the institutions of the Fourth Republic for France's political weakness &amp;mdash; a Gaullist reading still popular today. As he commissioned the [[Constitution of France|new constitution]] and was responsible for its overall framework, de Gaulle is sometimes described as the author of the constitution, although it was effectively drafted during the summer of 1958 by the Gaullist [[Michel Debré]]. The draft tightly espoused the 1946 [[speech of Bayeux]]'s propositions,&lt;ref name="gaul_bayeux"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/accueil/discours/de-gaulle-et-la-quatrieme-republique-1946-1958/discours-de-bayeux-16-juin-1946.php | title=Discours de Bayeux ''&lt;nowiki&gt;[Speech of Bayeux]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' | date=June 16, 1946 | last=Charles De Gaulle | publisher=charles-de-gaulle.org | language=fr | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517181914/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/accueil/discours/de-gaulle-et-la-quatrieme-republique-1946-1958/discours-de-bayeux-16-juin-1946.php | archivedate=May 17, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a strong [[Executive (government)|executive]] and to a rather [[presidentialism|presidential]] regime &amp;mdash; the President being granted the responsibility of governing the Council of Ministers,&lt;ref&gt;See the debates during the [[July Monarchy]] and the [[Bourbon Restoration]] concerning the role of the King and the role of the President of the Council&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to the adoption of article 16, granting "extraordinary powers" to the president if a [[state of emergency]] was proclaimed, and of [[bicameralism]].

Although most politicians supported de Gaulle, Mitterrand, who opposed the new Constitution, famously denounced "a permanent coup d'état" in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[[François Mitterrand]], ''Le Coup d'Etat permanent'', 1964&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 September 1958, a [[French constitutional referendum, 1958|referendum]] took place and 79.2% of those who voted supported the new constitution and the creation of the [[Fifth French Republic|Fifth Republic]]. The [[French Union|colonies]] (Algeria was officially three [[département|departments]] of France, not a colony) were given the choice between immediate independence and the new constitution. All colonies voted for the new constitution and the replacement of the French Union by the [[French Community]], except [[Guinea]], which thus became the first French African colony to gain independence, at the cost of the immediate cessation of all French assistance.&lt;ref name=Fenby/&gt;{{rp|407}}  

De Gaulle was elected [[President of the French Republic]] and of the African and Malagasy Community on 21 December 1958 by [[indirect suffrage]]. He was invested on 8 January 1959. In the meanwhile, de Gaulle had [[Franco-German relations|met the German chancellor]] [[Konrad Adenauer]] on 14 September 1958 at his home at [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises]]; had sent a memorandum to US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] on 17 September 1958, recalling his will of national independence; he also took financial measures on 27 December 1958 to reduce the state deficit, and, in Algeria, called for the "peace of the brave" (''paix des braves'') in October 1958.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

[[File:Mosul Vilayet, Ottoman Anatolia (1914).png|thumb|The [[Mosul Vilayet|vilayet of Mosul]] in 1914, with modern borders superimposed]]
The '''Mosul Question''' was a [[territorial dispute]] in the early 20th century between [[Turkey]] and the [[United Kingdom]] (later [[Kingdom of Iraq (Mandate administration)|Iraq]]) over the possession of the former Ottoman [[Mosul Vilayet]].

The [[Mosul Vilayet]] was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until the end of [[World War I]], when it was occupied by Britain. After the [[Turkish War of Independence]], the new Turkish Republic considered Mosul one of the crucial issues determined in the [[National Pact (Turkey)|National Pact]]. Despite constant resistance, Britain managed to bring the issue into the international arena, scaling it down to a frontier problem between Turkey and Iraq.

The [[League of Nations Council]] appointed an investigative commission that recommended that Iraq should retain Mosul, and Turkey reluctantly assented to the decision by signing the [[Frontier Treaty]] with the Iraqi government in 1926. Iraq agreed to give a 10 percent royalty on Mosul's oil deposits to Turkey for 25 years.

==History==
[[File:Ali Ihsan-Dadayli Halid.jpg|thumb|English and Ottoman officials meet in northern Iraq during November 1918]]
Near the end of [[World War I]], the debilitated Ottoman Empire signed the [[Armistice of Mudros]], calling for a ceasefire with the United Kingdom, on October 30, 1918. Three days later, on November 2, Lt. Gen. Sir [[William Marshall (British Army officer)|William Marshall]] invaded the Mosul Vilayet until November 15, 1918 when he was finally successful in defeating the Ottoman forces and causing them to surrender.&lt;ref name="rothwell"&gt;V.H. Rothwell: ''Mesopotamia in British War Aims'', in: [[The Historical Journal]], Vol. 13, No. 2 (1970), pp. 273-294. {{Page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1920, the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] was signed to end the war, however the Ottomans still contested the British right to Mosul and how it was taken illegally, post-Mudros. Even when the Lausanne Treaty was signed between Turkey and Britain in 1923, Turkey still maintained that Britain was controlling the Mosul Vilayet illegally.&lt;ref name="lloyd"&gt;The Geography of the Mosul Boundary "The Geographical Journal" by H.I. Lloyd 1926{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; British officials in London and Baghdad continued to believe that Mosul was imperative to the survival of Iraq because of its resources and the security of its mountainous border.&lt;ref name="simon"&gt;"The Creation of Iraq: 1914-1921" by Reeva Spector Simon and Eleanor H. Tejirian, New York: Columbia University Press 2004{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish leaders were also afraid that Kurdish nationalism would thrive under British Mandate and start trouble with the Kurdish population in Turkey.&lt;ref name="wright" /&gt;

In order to reach a resolution on the conflicting claims over Mosul, the League of Nations was called on to send a fact-finding commission in order to determine the rightful owner. The commission investigated the region and then reported that Turkey had no claim to Mosul and it belonged to the British and no one else had any rightful claim to the area.&lt;ref name="lloyd" /&gt;

Because of the amount of influence wielded by Britain in the [[League of Nations]], the decision of the fact-finding commission was not surprising.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Another aspect of Britain's influence on the League of Nations was that the Secretary of the War Cabinet, [[Maurice Hankey]], decided that Britain needed to have control over the whole area because of their oil concerns for the Royal Navy before the commission was completed.&lt;ref name="rothwell" /&gt;

Because Britain also wanted to soothe Turkish anger over the League of Nations decision, they gave them a portion of the oil profits. By having control over the oil and the IPC, the British stayed in control of the resources of Mosul even though they had given political control back to Faysal.

Another area of contention between Britain and Turkey was the actual boundary line. There was a Brussels Line which had been decided by the League of Nations as the true border of Iraq, and a British line which was the division line the Britain had used as reference in the past. When this was brought up to British leaders, both [[Percy Cox]], the British High Commissioner of Iraq, and [[Arnold Wilson]], the British civil commissioner in Baghdad, urged [[Lloyd George]], who was the Prime Minister, to use the Brussels line because they did not think there was that large of a difference between the two line boundaries.&lt;ref name="cox"&gt;The Geography of the Mosul Boundary: Discussion "The Geographical Journal" 1926{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other claimants==

===Kingdom of Iraq===
The Mosul Vilayet was not just contested by external powers, i.e. Britain and Turkey; [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faysal ibn Husayn]], the Hashemite ruler who had become the king of the newly created state of Iraq by the British in 1921, also wanted to claim the Mosul Vilayet as his. The British liked, and respected Faysal because of all of the assistance he had given to them; the British also felt that they could trust him to do what they wanted. In this belief, Britain was both right and wrong. Faysal was a brilliant diplomat who was able to balance what the British wanted and the true needs of his people into a very complex system. However, one of the things he wanted most was the unification and strong status of Iraq and he did not believe that was possible without having control of the Mosul Vilayet.

Prior to the League of Nations decision, Faysal had continually petitioned the British government to give control of Mosul to him so that he could succeed in his aim of unification. Finally, after the League of Nations decision, the British agree to let Faysal have control over Mosul in return for important resource concessions. The British founded the [[Turkish Petroleum Company]] which they later named the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC).

===Kurds===
Another internal group that wanted control over Mosul was the [[Kurds]]. The Kurds were the natural inhabitants of some parts of the Vilayet and did not want to belong to any other government other than their own. They had long fought against being integrated into Iraq because they wanted independence. Most Kurds did not consider themselves as a part of the new country of Iraq. Various Kurdish leaders rallied Kurdish groups who already had their own firepower and had been helped by different imperial powers on occasions when it suited their needs. Furthermore, many Kurds felt betrayed by promises the British had made to them in earlier times and subsequently not kept. Faysal wanted to integrate them because, as by a majority [[Sunnis]], he needed them to balance out the [[Shiite]] population. Britain used both the Kurdish firepower and Faysal's desire for a united Iraq in order to keep a stranglehold over him, and later Iran used the Kurds and their firepower in order to keep unrest in Iraq during the reign of [[Khomeini]]. The Kurds did not want to be integrated into Iraq; however they did support the continuance of the British mandate in the area.&lt;ref name="wright" /&gt;

==Demographics==
The vilayet had a Kurdish speaking population, a large Assyrian [[Syriac language|Syriac]] speaking population&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=AdZfWpd4YrYC |page=171 |title=Assyrians, Kurds, and Ottomans: Intercommunal Relations on the Periphery of the Ottoman Empire }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an Arabic speaking population, and in contrast to Mosul's neighbors, it was much more directly integrated into the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="tripp"&gt;"A History of Iraq" by Charles Tripp, New York: Cambridge Press 2007 {{Page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to the religious communities, it was predominately Sunni with notable communities of Turkmen, Kurds, Assyrian Christians and Jews with a total population of about 800,000 people in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;The Mosul Dispute "The American Journal of International Law" by Quincy Wright{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These communities and their respective leaders were heavily influenced by the political hierarchy, trading networks, and the judicial system of the Ottoman Empire, even though they considered themselves on their own and not completely controlled by the empire.&lt;ref name="tripp" /&gt;

==Economic resources==
[[File:Die Stadt Mosul in Assyrien Mitte des 19.jpg|thumb|left|An 1876 sketch of Mosul]]
During the period of Ottoman rule, Mosul was involved in the production of fine cotton goods. Oil was a known commodity in the region and it became critically important during World War I and continuing until today. Mosul was considered a trading capital of the Ottoman Empire because of its location along the trade routes to India and the Mediterranean; also it was considered a political sub-capitol.

==Local politics==
The leadership was constantly plagued with accusations of corruption and incompetence, and leaders were replaced with an alarming regularity.&lt;ref name="cetinsaya"&gt;"Ottoman Administration of Iraq 1890-1908" by Gokhan Cetinsaya New York: Routledge, 2006{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, because of these problems, the administration of Mosul was entrusted to Palace and notable favorites, where the high official's careers were usually determined by tribal issues within their states.&lt;ref name="cetinsaya" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14193">An '''online petition''' (or '''Internet petition''', or '''e-petition''') is a form of [[petition]] which is signed online, usually through a form on a [[website]]. Visitors to the online petition sign the petition by adding their details such as name and email address. Typically, after there are enough signatories, the resulting letter may be delivered to the subject of the petition, usually via [[e-mail]]. The online petition may also deliver an email to the target of the petition each time the petition is signed.

==Pros and cons==
The format makes it easy for people to make a petition at any time. Several websites allow anyone with computer access to make one to protest any cause, such as stopping construction or closure of a [[Retailing|store]]. Because petitions are easy to set up, the site can attract frivolous causes, or jokes framed in the ostensible form of a petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://virkeligheden.dk/2009/stork-fountain-experiment-1-facebook-groups-are-not-democratic-tools/ |title=Stork Fountain Experiment #1: Why Facebook groups are not democratic tools &amp;#124; Virkeligheden |publisher=Virkeligheden.dk |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=2014-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online petitions may be abused if signers don't use real names, thus undermining its legitimacy. Verification, for example via a confirmation [[e-mail]] can prevent padding a petition with false names and e-mails. Many petition sites now have safeguards to match real world processes; such as local governments requiring protest groups to present petition signatures, plus their printed name, and a way to verify the signature (either with a phone number or identification number via a [[driver's license]] or a [[passport]]) to ensure that the signature is legitimate and not falsified by the protestors.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web| last = Mikkelson | first = Barbara | title = Internet Petitions| publisher = [[Snopes.com]] | date = 2007-06-09 | url = http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/petition/internet.asp }} Copy of the article now available at http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Practical/Shop--ToDo/Activism/InternetPetitions.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

There are now several major web initiatives featuring online petitions, for example [[Change.org]], [[Avaaz.org]], and [[38 Degrees]]. These are growing in popularity and ability to achieve political impact. The ''Economist'' commented that Avaaz has had "some spectacular successes", but raises questions about what objective measures can be used to assess "the reach of a global e-protest movement".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/16943875 A town crier in the global village], The Economist, 2 September 2010. Accessed 20 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, several petitions on [[Change.org]] have been attributed to the reversal of a United Airlines Dog Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-united-lifts-ban-on-9-breeds-of-dog-20120508,0,4836681.story | work=Chicago Tribune | title=United lifts ban on 9 breeds of dog | date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some legitimate [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) shun online petitions. Reasons include the paucity of examples of this form of petition achieving its objective. Critics frequently cite it as an example of [[slacktivism]].&lt;ref name="snopes" /&gt;

In February 2007 an online petition against road pricing and car tracking on the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]]'s own website attracted over 1.8 million e-signatures from a population of 60 million people. The site was official but experimental at the time.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| title = Roads petition breaks a million| publisher = [[BBC News]]| date = 2007-02-10 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6349027.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shocked government ministers were unable to backtrack on the site's existence in the face of national news coverage of the phenomenon. The incident has demonstrated both the potential and pitfalls of online [[e-Government]] petitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page11050.asp PM emails road pricing signatories] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090214111155/http:/www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page11050.asp |date=2009-02-14 }}, Number10.gov.uk, 20 February 2007. Accessed 31 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===E-mail petitions===
A similar form of petition is the e-mail petition. This petition may be a simple [[chain letter]], requesting that its users forward them to a large number of people in order to meet a goal or to attain a falsely promised reward. Other times the usage will contain a form to be printed and filled out, or a link to an offsite online petition which the recipient can sign. Usually, the e-mail petition focuses on a specific cause that is meant to cause outrage or ire, centering on a timely political or cultural topic.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; E-mail petitions were among the earliest attempts to garner attention to a cause from an online audience.

===First successful Internet petition===
The first known successful online petition was written during the summer of 1998. This was a petition to the New York Mets with the goal of re-signing catcher Mike Piazza as a free agent. Piazza had been obtained by the Mets earlier in the season and was eligible for free agency for the 1999 season. The petition was publicized through a Geocities website, various newsgroups and emails, garnering 10,316 signatures. The petition was sent to Mike Piazza, his agents, Mets ownership and general manager Mike Phillips.

A digitized copy of the petition, documentation of the petition through news articles, and a sound file of Mike Phillips announcing Piazza's signing for seven years along with his acknowledgment of the petition are available in the research files of the A. Bartlett Giamatti Research Center of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

===World Wide Web===
With the rise of the [[World Wide Web]] as a platform for commerce, activism and discussion, an opportunity to garner attention for various social causes was perceived by various players, resulting in a more formalized structure for online petitions; one of the first web-based petition hosts, [[PetitionOnline]], was founded in 1999, with others such as GoPetition (founded in 2000),&lt;ref name="Reputation.com"&gt;{{cite web| title = History of GoPetition - Interview with John Pope | url = http://www.reputation.com/reputationwatch/blog/expert-interview-john-pope }}&lt;/ref&gt; thePetitionSite.com, iPetitions, and others being established in the years since. Petition hosts served as accessible external locations for the creation of a wide variety of petitions for free by users, providing easier interfaces for such petitions in comparison to the previous e-mail petitions and informal web forum-based petitions. However, petition hosts were criticized for their lax requirements from users who created or signed such petitions: petitions were often only signed with false or anonymous nomenclatures, and often resulted in disorganized side commentary between signers of the same petition.

The rise of online social networking in the later 2000s, however, resulted in both an increase of Internet petition integration into social networks and an increase of visibility for such petitions; [[Facebook]], [[Change.org]], [[Care2]], [[Avaaz.org]], [[SumOfUs]], GoPetition and other sites serve as examples of the integration of Internet petitions as a form of [[social media]] and [[user-generated content]]. Such networks may have proven to be more fertile ground for the creation of, signing of and response to online petitions, as such networks generally lack the heightened level of anonymity associated with the earlier dedicated petition hosts.

In some cases petition sites have managed to reach agreement with state institutions about the implementation mechanism of widely supported initiatives. Thus, platform [[ManaBalss.lv]] in [[Latvia]] has the authority to hand over to a national parliament any legally correct initiative which has been signed by more than 10,000 authenticated supporters. Approximately half of these initiatives have been either supported by parliament or are in the process of review.

==E-government petitions in Europe and Australia==
[[File:Bus advertisement.jpg|thumb|right|Simulated bus advertisement used to promote an e-Petition to the British Prime Minister&lt;ref name=britpm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/british-pm-petition.html |title=British e-petition |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[UK Parliament petitions website]] was suspended in April 2010 but then reopened in a new guise in August 2011, with time allocated for parliamentary debate a possibility for petitions attracting more than 100,000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/ |title=HM Government e-petitions|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some parliaments, government agencies and officials, such as The [[Scottish Parliament]] with the [[e-Petitioner]] system (from 1999), the [[Queensland Parliament]] in Australia,&lt;ref name="Queensland Parliament E-Petitions"&gt;{{cite web| title = Queensland Parliament E-Petitions | url = http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/view/EPetitions_QLD/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; German [[Bundestag]]&lt;ref name="E-Petitionen an den Deutschen Bundestag"&gt;{{cite web| title = E-Petitionen an den Deutschen Bundestag| url = https://epetitionen.bundestag.de/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; (from 2005), [[Cabinet of ministers of Ukraine]] (from 2016)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.info/politics/1491296-ukrainians-can-submit-e-petitions-to-sabinet-from-aug-29.html Ukrainians can submit e-petitions to Cabinet from Aug 29], [[UNIAN]] (29 August 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bristol City Council]]&lt;ref name="Bristol City Council E-Petitions"&gt;{{cite web| title = Bristol City Council E-Petitions | url = http://epetitions.bristol.gov.uk/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.K have adopted electronic petitioning systems as a way to display a commitment to their constituents and provide greater accessibility into government operations.&lt;ref name="Parliament of Western Australia"&gt;{{cite web| title = Petition effectiveness: improving citizens’ direct access to parliament| publisher = Parliament of Western Australia| date = 2007-08-23 | url = http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/web/webpages.nsf/WebFiles/ASPG+2007+-+Palmieri/$FILE/Palmieri.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 requires all principal authorities to provide a facility for people to submit petitions electronically.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url =http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/20/contents|access-date = 25 June 2016|title =Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement came into force on 15 December 2010.

==E-government petitions in the United States==
{{main|We the People (petitioning system)}}

The US government created [[We the People (petitioning system)|We The People]] in 2011 as a platform for creating and signing petitions on the White House web server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabochek|first=Katelyn|title=White House Blog|work=Petition the White House with We the People|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White House originally required petitions to gather 5,000 signatures within 30 days, after which time policy officials in the administration would review the petition and issue an official response. Within two weeks of its launch, the threshold was raised to 25,000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House's We the People|url=https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/how-why/terms-participation-archive|work=Terms of Participation Archive|accessdate=13 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124052154/https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/Petitions#!/how-why/terms-participation-archive|archivedate=24 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further changes in 2013 raised the threshold to 100,000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House's We the People|url=https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/how-why/terms-participation|work=Terms of Participation|accessdate=13 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124052154/https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/Petitions#!/how-why/terms-participation|archivedate=24 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other groups are attempting to establish electronic petitioning as a way to streamline and make existing citizens' [[initiative]] processes more accessible.&lt;ref name="signmyname.org"&gt;{{cite web| title = Online e-Petitioning in Michigan | url = http://signmyname.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate over efficacy==
As is the case with public perceptions of [[slacktivism]], Internet petitions are both a popular resort of [[Internet activism|web-based activism]] and a target of criticism from those who feel that such petitions are often disregarded by their targets because of the anonymity of petition signers; [[Snopes.com]], for example, sides against the usage of Internet petitions as a method of activism.&lt;ref name="snopes" /&gt; On the other hand, the creators of petition hosts, such as Randy Paynter of [[Care2]] and thePetitionSite.com, have defended web-based petitions as being more feasible, credible and effective than e-mail petitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.frogloop.com/care2blog/2010/4/28/slacktivism-why-snopes-got-it-wrong-about-internet-petitions.html| title = Slacktivism: Why Snopes got it Wrong About Internet Petitions| first = Randy| last = Paynter| work = Frogloop| publisher = Care2| date = April 28, 2010 &lt;!-- at 01:58PM --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming they are not fairly judged as a method of activism by their critics. Since then, Snopes.com has removed the text about the inefficacy of Internet petitions.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt;

==History==

===Formation===
The PQ is the result of the 1968 merger between former [[Quebec Liberal Party]] cabinet minister [[René Lévesque]]'s [[Mouvement Souveraineté-Association]] and the [[Ralliement national]].&lt;ref name="Crouch2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cameron I. Crouch|title=Managing Terrorism and Insurgency: Regeneration, Recruitment and Attrition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMaOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51|date=10 September 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-23018-0|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the creation of the PQ, the [[Rassemblement pour l'Indépendance Nationale]] held a general assembly that voted to dissolve the RIN. Its former members were invited to join the new Parti Québécois.

The PQ's primary goals were to obtain political, economic and social autonomy for the province of Quebec.  Lévesque introduced the strategy of referenda early in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/echoing/6255813/story.html#ixzz1oMhu9Q2n ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lévesque and the PQ's first government===
The PQ faced its first electoral test in the [[Quebec general election, 1970|1970 provincial election]], winning seven seats. However, Lévesque was unable to get into the renamed National Assembly. Although it lost one seat in [[Quebec general election, 1973|1973]], the decimation of the other parties, particularly the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]], allowed it to become the official opposition even though Lévesque was still unable to win a seat.

In the [[Quebec general election, 1976|1976 provincial election]], the Parti Québécois won government for the first time, taking 71 of the 110 seats available. Lévesque became the [[Premier of Quebec]]. This provided cause for celebration among many [[French-speaking Quebecer]]s, while it resulted in an acceleration of the migration of the province's [[English-speaking Quebecker|Anglophone]] population and related economic activity toward [[Toronto]].

The first PQ government was known as the "republic of professors" because of the large number of scholars in Lévesque's [[Executive Council of Quebec|cabinet]]. The PQ was the first government to recognize the rights of [[Aboriginal peoples in Quebec|Aboriginal peoples]] to self-determination, insofar as this self-determination did not affect the territorial integrity of Quebec. The PQ passed laws on public consultations and the financing of political parties, which ensured equal financing of political parties and limited contributions by individuals to $3000. However, the most prominent legacy of the PQ is the [[Charter of the French Language]] (Bill 101), a framework law which defines the linguistic primacy of French and seeks to make French the common public language of Quebec. It allowed the advancement of francophones towards management roles, until then largely out of their reach. Despite the fact that 85% of the population spoke French and most of them did not understand English, the language of management was English in most medium and large businesses.  Critics, both Francophone and Anglophone, have however criticized the charter for restraining citizens' linguistic school choice, as it forbids immigrants and Quebecers of French descent from attending English-language schools funded by the state (private schools remained an option for those who could afford tuition).  The Parti Québécois initiated the [[Quebec referendum, 1980|1980 Quebec referendum]] seeking a mandate to begin negotiation for [[sovereignty-association]].&lt;ref&gt;http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-and-the-constitution-a-timeline-of-dead-ends&lt;/ref&gt; It was rejected by 60 per cent of voters.

The party was re-elected in the [[Quebec general election, 1981|1981 election]], but in November 1984 it experienced the most severe [[Parti Québécois Crisis, 1984|internal crisis]] of its existence.  Lévesque wanted to focus on governing Quebec rather than sovereignty, and also wanted to adopt a more conciliatory approach on constitutional issues.   This angered the more ardent sovereigntists, known as the [[pur et dur|''purs et durs'']].  Lévesque was forced to resign as a result. In September 1985, [[Parti Québécois leadership election, 1985|the party leadership election]] chose [[Pierre-Marc Johnson]] as his successor.

Despite its social-democratic past, the PQ failed to gain admission into the [[Socialist International]], after the membership application was vetoed by the federal [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="LipsetGomez2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Seymour Martin Lipset|author2=Rafael Gomez|author3=Ivan Katchanovski|title=The paradox of American unionism: Why Americans like unions more than Canadians do, but join much less|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_tjAY9yYBYC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=18 August 2012|year=2004|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-4200-1|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finkel1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alvin Finkel|title=Our Lives: Canada After 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4tRswA9muykC&amp;pg=PA200|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=1 April 1997|publisher=James Lorimer &amp; Company|isbn=978-1-55028-551-2|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiseman2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nelson Wiseman|title=In Search of Canadian Political Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TD5bmHBbDFIC&amp;pg=PA176|accessdate=18 August 2012|year=2007|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-1388-4|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1985 defeat===
The PQ led by Johnson was defeated by the [[Quebec Liberal Party]] in the [[Quebec general election, 1985|1985 election]] that saw [[Robert Bourassa]] return as premier. The Liberals served in office for two terms and attempted to negotiate a constitutional settlement with the rest of Canada but with the failure of the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and the [[Charlottetown Accord]], two packages of proposed amendments to the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]], the question of Quebec's status remained unresolved and the Quebec sovereignty movement revived.

===Return to power under Parizeau===
The PQ returned to power under the leadership of hardline sovereigntist [[Jacques Parizeau]] in the [[Quebec general election, 1994|1994 Quebec election]]. This saw the PQ win 77 seats and 44% of the vote, on a promise to hold an independence referendum within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/06/02/canada-politics-parizeau-idINL1N0YO0OM20150602|title=UPDATE 1-Former Quebec separatist leader Parizeau dies at 84|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|work=reuters.com|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Parizeau called the [[Quebec referendum, 1995|1995 Quebec referendum]] proposing negotiations on sovereignty. Again, the sovereigntists lost the vote. The final count showed 49.42% of voters supported negotiations that could eventually lead to sovereignty. On the night of the defeat, an emotionally drained Premier Parizeau stated that the loss was caused by [[Money and the ethnic vote|"money and ethnic votes"]] (which led to accusations that Parizeau  was racist) as well as by the divided votes amongst francophones. Parizeau resigned the next day (as he is alleged to have planned beforehand in case of a defeat).

===Bouchard government===
[[Lucien Bouchard]], a former member of Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]]'s [[Canadian Cabinet|Cabinet]] and later founder of the [[Bloc Québécois]], a federal-level sovereigntist party, succeeded Parizeau as PQ leader, but chose not to call another referendum due to the absence of "winning conditions". Bouchard's government then balanced the provincial budget&amp;nbsp;– a feat achieved in Canada only by the federal government and a few of the ten Canadian provinces at that point&amp;nbsp;– by reducing [[government spending]], including social programs. The PQ was re-elected in the [[Quebec general election, 1998|1998 election]], despite receiving fewer votes than the Quebec Liberal Party led by former federal deputy prime minister [[Jean Charest]].  Bouchard resigned in 2001, and was succeeded as PQ leader and Quebec Premier by [[Bernard Landry]], a former PQ Finance minister. Under Landry's leadership, the party lost the [[Quebec general election, 2003|2003 election]] to Jean Charest's Liberals.

===Return to opposition===
Mid-late 2004 was difficult for Landry's leadership, which was being contested. A vote was held during the party's June 2005 convention to determine whether Landry continued to have the confidence of the party membership. Landry said he wanted at least 80% of approval and after gaining 76.2% approval on the confidence vote from party membership on 4 June 2005, Landry announced his intention to resign.&lt;ref name="landry-resignation"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sympaticomsn.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1117929100254_5?hub=topstories |title=Bernard Landry quits as Parti Québécois leader |accessdate=9 May 2007 |date=5 May 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910215351/http://sympaticomsn.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1117929100254_5?hub=topstories |archivedate=10 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louise Harel]] had been chosen to replace him until a new leader, [[André Boisclair]], was elected 15 November 2005, through the party's [[Parti Québécois leadership election, 2005|2005 leadership election]]. At the time of Boisclair's election, the PQ was as much as 20 percent ahead of the Liberals in opinion polls, suggesting that Boisclair would lead them to a landslide majority government in the next election.&lt;ref name="polls"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thestar.com/News/article/196333 | title=PQ fails miserably to rally sovereignists | accessdate=9 May 2007 | date=27 March 2007 | work=The Star | location=Toronto | first=Chantal | last=Hébert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Splintering on the right and the left===
Progressives on the left wing of the PQ perceived a rightward move by the party towards [[neoliberalism]] under Bouchard, Landry and Boisclair. In 2006, a new left-wing party, [[Québec solidaire]], was formed which included many activists who would have formerly been members or supporters of the PQ. Over subsequent elections, the QS would attract increasing support from left-wing sovereigntists disillusioned with the PQ, while on the right, the ADQ and later the [[Coalition Avenir Québec]] attracted the votes of right-wing and soft sovereigntists who eventually become [[Quebec autonomism|Quebec autonomists]] and [[Canadian federalism|Canadian federalists]] while retaining their Quebec nationalist identities, resulting in the PQ being squeezed from both sides.

===Third place===
The PQ was unable to maintain the momentum it briefly had under Boisclair, and in the [[Quebec general election, 2007|2007 provincial election]], the party fell to 36 seats and behind the conservative [[Action démocratique du Québec]] (ADQ) in number of seats and the popular vote: this is the first time since 1973 that the party did not form the government or [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]]. Boisclair said that the voters clearly did not support a strategy of a rapid referendum in the first mandate of a PQ government. Instead of a policy convention following the election, the party held a presidents' council.  The party caucus in the provincial legislative assembly was said to have supported Boisclair continuing as leader.

On May 8, 2007 Boisclair announced his resignation as leader of the PQ.&lt;ref name="boisclair-resignation"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/08/world/europe/08cnd-quebec.html?ex=1179288000&amp;en=010441e320466698&amp;ei=5070 | title=Quebec Separatist Leader Resigns | accessdate=9 May 2007 | date=8 May 2007 | work=The New York Times | first=Christopher | last=Mason}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was effective immediately, although Boisclair confirmed he would remain within the PQ caucus for the time being. He was replaced by veteran MNA [[François Gendron]], pending a leadership race and convention.
[[File:Pauline Marois Quebec-3 Sept 2012-7.JPG|thumb|right|Former PQ leader Pauline Marois greets voters in Quebec City on the eve of the 2012 general election.]]

Former Bloc Québécois leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] was the first to announce his intention to run for party leadership, on 11 May 2007. He was followed the same day by [[Pauline Marois]]. In a surprise move, Duceppe withdrew on the 12th&amp;nbsp;– leaving Marois the only declared candidate.  No other candidates came forward, and on 26 June 2007, Marois won the leadership by acclamation.

In June 2011, the party was shaken when three of its most prominent MNAs—popular actor [[Pierre Curzi]], former cabinet minister [[Louise Beaudoin]], and [[Lisette Lapointe]], the wife of former premier [[Jacques Parizeau]], followed the next day by a fourth, [[Jean-Martin Aussant]], quit the party to sit as [[independent (politics)|independents]] over Marois's support for a bill changing the law to permit an agreement between the [[Quebec City|City of Québec]] and [[Quebecor]] Inc. concerning the management of the new sports and entertainment complex in Quebec City.&lt;ref name="resignation"&gt;{{cite news|title=PQ left reeling after three top members of Quebec sovereigntist party quit |url=http://www.thecanadianpress.com/english/online/OnlineFullStory.aspx?filename=DOR-MNN-CP.8ad03e57162c461f97c54389d18b54c2.CPKEY2008111303&amp;newsitemid=7067934&amp;languageid=1 |accessdate=6 June 2011 |newspaper=[[The Canadian Press]] |date=6 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721172218/http://www.thecanadianpress.com/english/online/OnlineFullStory.aspx?filename=DOR-MNN-CP.8ad03e57162c461f97c54389d18b54c2.CPKEY2008111303&amp;newsitemid=7067934&amp;languageid=1 |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unrest continued later in the month when a fifth MNA, [[Benoit Charette]], also quit, citing his dissatisfaction with the party's sole focus being sovereignty. Beaudoin rejoined the PQ caucus in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/a9cois+leader+Pauline+Marois+welcomes+Louise+Beaudoin+back+into+fold/6404018/story.html |title=Parti Québécois leader Pauline Marois welcomes MNA Louise Beaudoin back into the fold |date=3 April 2012 |newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]] |author=Philip Authier |accessdate=3 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405232620/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/a9cois%2Bleader%2BPauline%2BMarois%2Bwelcomes%2BLouise%2BBeaudoin%2Bback%2Binto%2Bfold/6404018/story.html |archivedate=5 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marois minority government===
The party won a [[minority government]] under Marois in the [[Quebec general election, 2012|2012 provincial election]] with 54 of 125 seats in the National Assembly. It embarked on a program of "sovereigntist governance" in relations with the rest of Canada, to return Quebec to balanced budgets through higher taxes and debt reduction, to increase the use of French in public services, and to address resource development in Northern Quebec. However the PQ's 'new Bill 101' did not pass. The centrepiece of the government's program was a [[Quebec Charter of Values]] which would have curtailed minority religious identity by banning the wearing of religious symbols by those in the employ of the government, particularly Sikh turbans, Muslim veils and Jewish kippas.

===2014 defeat===
Based on the charter's growing popularity among francophones, Marois called an early election for 7 April 2014 in an attempt to win a majority government.  Despite leading in the polls when the writ was dropped, the campaign went badly due to several mishaps. The recruitment of [[star candidate]] [[Pierre Karl Péladeau]], whose comments made sovereignty and the prospect of another referendum a focus of the campaign, as well as feminist [[Janette Bertrand]] suggesting that wealthy Muslim men were taking over swimming pools, among other incidents badly hurt the PQ.[http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/Leader+Pauline+Marois+campaign+goes+from+catastrophic+Quebec/9686637/story.html] Marois' government was defeated by the Liberals, led by [[Philippe Couillard]], in the [[Quebec general election, 2014|2014 provincial election]] which resulted in a Liberal majority government. The PQ won 25% of the vote and 30 seats, its worst result in terms of popular vote since [[Quebec general election, 1970|1970]]. Marois announced her intention to resign as PQ leader that night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pauline Marois resigns as PQ leader after crushing defeat|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/pauline-marois-resigns-as-pq-leader-after-crushing-defeat-1.1765703|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=CTV News|date=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stéphane Bédard]] was chosen interim parliamentary leader by the PQ caucus on 10 April 2014.&lt;ref name=bedard&gt;{{cite news|title=PQ elects Stephane Bedard to interim leader post|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/pq-elects-stephane-bedard-to-interim-leader-post-1.1770213|accessdate=10 April 2014|newspaper=CTV News|date=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 20 October 2014 [[Lévis (provincial electoral district)|Lévis]] by-election, PQ candidate Alexandre Bégin came in third place, with 8.28% of the popular vote, only narrowly beating Québec Solidaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vendeville|first=Geoffrey|url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/caq-holds-the-fort-in-levis-byelection|title=CAQ holds the fort in Lévis byelection|publisher=[[The Montreal Gazette]]|date=21 October 2014|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Péladeau leadership===
{{see also|Parti Québécois leadership election, 2015}}
On November 27, 2014, [[Pierre Karl Péladeau]] announced his intentions to run for PQ's leadership, joining [[Bernard Drainville]], [[Martine Ouellet]], [[Jean-François Lisée]], [[Alexandre Cloutier]], and Pierre Céré.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Authier|first1=Philip|title=Pierre Karl Péladeau joins the PQ leadership race|url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/pierre-karl-peladeau-says-he-is-in-the-pq-leadership-race|accessdate=20 October 2015|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a fiercely contested race, Péladeau was the frontrunner for much of the campaign, causing Jean-François Lisée to drop out in January 2015, Bernard Drainville to drop out on April 22, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Authier|first1=Philip|title=Drainville drops out of PQ race after concluding the troops want PKP|url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/drainville-drops-out-of-pq-race-after-concluding-the-troops-want-pkp|accessdate=20 October 2015|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pierre Céré to follow Drainville only five days before the leadership election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Authier|first1=Philip|title=After long campaign, fate of new PQ leader in the hands of party members|url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/after-long-campaign-fate-of-new-pq-leader-in-the-hands-of-party-members|accessdate=20 October 2015|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, 2015, [[Pierre Karl Péladeau]] was elected permanent leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/pierre-karl-peladeau-elected-leader-of-parti-quebecois-1.2375351|title=Pierre Karl Peladeau elected leader of Parti Quebecois|publisher=[[CTV News]]|date=May 15, 2015|accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2016, Péladeau announced that he was retiring from politics to dedicate more time to his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/pierre-karl-peladeau-steps-down-as-pq-leader|title=Péladeau stuns political world, steps down for family reasons|publisher=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=May 2, 2016|accessdate=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jean-François Lisée leadership===

[[Jean-François Lisée]] was [[Parti Québécois leadership election, 2016|elected leader of Parti Québécois]] on October 7, 2016.  

Lisée charged [[Manon Massé]] with reneging in unsuccessful deliberations for a putative electoral alliance between the Parti Québécois and [[Québec Solidaire]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-election-lisee-defends-attack-on-qs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/politique/politique-quebecoise/201705/21/01-5100093-quebec-solidaire-rejet-clair-dune-alliance-avec-le-pq.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collapse and loss of official party status===

The [[Quebec general election, 2018|2018 provincial election]] unfolded in a historic way, being the first time in a half century a party other than the Parti Québécois or Liberals were elected to power, with a [[Coalition Avenir Québec]] majority win. It also marked, for the first time in 42 years, that the Parti Québécois failed to win a sufficient number of seats to maintain its official party status. With only 10 seats won, not only did it lose its [[official party status]], but was relegated to third place (tied with Québec Solidaire) — the party's worst showing in terms of its placement in the National Assembly since the [[Quebec general election, 1970|1970 provincial election]] when the party first appeared. In this election the Parti Québécois only managed to acquire 17% of the popular vote, the lowest score in party's history. With few exceptions, its support bled to the CAQ; in many cases, ridings that had been in PQ hands for 40 years or more fell by large margins. Leader Jean-François Lisée failed to win his own seat and therefore resigned shortly thereafter, accepting the blame for his party's failure and collapse. After 50 years in the forefront of Quebec politics, the Parti Québécois had been pushed into marginal status, with its very survival in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-after-50-years-pq-pushed-to-political-margins-as-lisee-loses-montreal/&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Christian Bourque of Montreal-based pollster Léger suggested that the PQ was likely finished in its present form, and would have to merge with another sovereigntist party to avoid fading into irrelevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/02/quebec-election-results-caq-victory-francois-legault|title=

==Relationship with the Bloc Québécois==
The [[Bloc Québécois]] (BQ) is a [[List of federal political parties in Canada|federal political party]] founded in 1990 by former Progressive Conservative MP [[Lucien Bouchard]]. It has traditionally had close ties to the Parti Québécois and shares its principal objective of [[sovereignty]]. The two parties have frequently shared political candidates, and have supported each other during election campaigns. The two parties have a similar membership and voter base. Prominent members of either party often attend and speak at both organizations' public events. [[Gilles Duceppe]], the former Bloc leader, is also the son of [[Jean Duceppe]], a Quebec actor who helped found the PQ.

In June 2014, [[Mario Beaulieu (politician)|Mario Beaulieu]], a former PQ riding president and Bloc candidate, was elected leader of the Bloc Québécois.  Notwithstanding his previous ties to both parties, Beaulieu has been critical of what he sees as a too timid approach to sovereignty by both the Bloc and PQ.  Beaulieu's election as Bloc leader was more warmly received by the PQ's rival party, [[Option nationale]], than by the PQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Don|first1=Macpherson|title=Mario Beaulieu’s victory shows the Bloc’s irrelevance|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Macpherson+Mario+Beaulieu+victory+shows+Bloc+irrelevance/9944189/story.html|work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714181254/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Macpherson+Mario+Beaulieu+victory+shows+Bloc+irrelevance/9944189/story.html|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Les députés bloquistes lancent un appel au calme|url=http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/06/17/bloc-quebecois-mario-beaulieu-appel-au-calme-des-deputes_n_5502216.html|accessdate=3 July 2014|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gagnon|first1=Lysiane|title=Will the Bloc Self-Destruct?|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/will-the-bloc-self-destruct/article19215051/#dashboard/follows/|accessdate=3 July 2014|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Ties to far right groups===
In 2018 it was reported that the base of the party, shows a growing coziness between far-right groups like [[La Meute]] and Storm Alliance on the one hand, and members and supporters of the Parti Québécois on the other — from grassroots activists to aspiring candidates to officials on the executive council.&lt;ref&gt;http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/blurring-the-lines-between-quebecs-far-right-and-political-mainstream-on-facebook&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo==
[[File:1985 Parti québécois logo.gif.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Logo of the party from 1985 to 2007]]
The party's distinctive logo was designed in 1968 by painter and poet Roland Giguère. It consists of a stylised letter Q, represented by a blue circle broken by a red arrow. The creator meant it as an [[allegory]] of the Parti Québécois breaking the circle of [[colonialism]] which he claimed Canada was imposing on Quebec and opening Quebec upon the world and the future.&lt;ref name="logo"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archives.radio-canada.ca/IDC-0-17-1123-6138/politique_economie/parti_quebecois_levesque/clip4 | title=Archives de Radio-Canada: Fondation du Parti québécois| accessdate=9 May 2007 | date=8 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PQ has made very few significant modifications to its logo during its history. In 1985 it made the circle and arrow slightly thicker, and placed the tip of the latter at the centre of the circle. The original saw it span the whole diameter. When placed upon a blue background instead of a white one, the circle was commonly turned to white, the single main design variation currently observed.

The party revealed a new logo on 21 February 2007, at the beginning of the 2007 provincial election campaign. While maintaining the basic style of past logos, the Q was redesigned and modernized. In addition, the tail of the Q was recoloured green.

==Party policy==
{{Update|date=March 2017}}
{{Unbalanced|date=March 2017}}
The Parti Québécois centres on the protection of the Franco-Québécois identity, up to or including the ultimate result of sovereignty-association. Sovereigntism, however, is 'Article 1' in its party program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fidler |first=Richard |url=http://lifeonleft.blogspot.ca/2011/06/behind-those-resignations-from-parti.html |title=Life on the Left: Behind those resignations from the Parti Québécois |publisher=Lifeonleft.blogspot.ca |date=2011-06-07 |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy rejected the long-standing "non-interference, non-indifference" stance towards Quebec should it seek sovereignty in 2009, PQ leader and Premier Pauline Marois' visit to France in October 2012 saw her reinstate it with French President François Hollande.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dougherty |first=Kevin |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Quebec+sovereignty+France+President+Hollande+returns/7390753/story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018053954/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Quebec+sovereignty+France+President+Hollande+returns/7390753/story.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 October 2012 |title=France’s president embraces traditional "ni, ni" stance on Quebec’s future |publisher=Montrealgazette.com |date=15 October 2012 |accessdate=19 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during her visit, Marois commented that "Canada's current foreign policy corresponds to neither our values nor our interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/travel/Parti+Quebecois+Premier+Pauline+Marois+tears+strip+Harpers/7397190/story.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130130212748/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/travel/Parti+Quebecois+Premier+Pauline+Marois+tears+strip+Harpers/7397190/story.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 January 2013 |title=Parti Quebecois Premier Pauline Marois tears a strip off Harper's foreign policy |publisher=Ottawacitizen.com |date= |accessdate=19 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PQ delivered a brief to the [[reasonable accommodation]] commission on minorities, which conducted hearings across the province. The commission briefing looked to reformulate the relations between Quebec's [[francophone]] and minority populations. Its task was to be a platform for the PQ's protectionism of French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20071005.MAROIS05/TPStory/National |work=Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |title=globeandmail.com: National |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109025911/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20071005.MAROIS05/TPStory/National |archivedate=9 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marois stated there is nothing dogmatic in Francophones wishing to declare their existence even if it includes developing legislation requiring newcomers to have a basic understanding of French before becoming citizens of Quebec.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} (Note that there are no official citizens of Quebec{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}; residents of Quebec are citizens of Canada.)

Further to her desire to protect French in Quebec, during Marois' visit to France in October 2012, she recommended that the "French elite" conduct themselves only in French on the international scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/life/Letter+Marois+telling+France+what/7403202/story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019203129/http://www.montrealgazette.com/life/Letter+Marois+telling+France+what/7403202/story.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 October 2012 |title=Letter: Marois telling France what to do |publisher=Montrealgazette.com |date= |accessdate=19 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some of Marois’ international critics scoffed at her pretension that the “French elite” were Québécois.

Marois stated the PQ understands the arrival of newcomers is attractive and they donate largely to Quebec's growth, but she stated that does not imply that to better assimilate them that "we must erase our own history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/politics/story.html?id=dc07ef77-b74f-4108-80ab-a86729cb5dd2&amp;k=83784 |title=PQ leader defends citizenship plan |publisher=Canada.com |date=21 October 2007 |accessdate=20 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104005910/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/politics/story.html?id=dc07ef77-b74f-4108-80ab-a86729cb5dd2&amp;k=83784 |archivedate=4 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, the PQ electoral program describes the party’s main commitment: "Aspiring to political liberty, the Parti Québécois has as its first objective to achieve the sovereignty of Quebec after consulting the population by a referendum to be held at the moment that the government judges appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/03/12/william-johnson-hard-truths-for-separatists/ |title=William Johnson: Hard truths for separatists &amp;#124; National Post |publisher=Fullcomment.nationalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140318221441/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/03/12/william-johnson-hard-truths-for-separatists/ |archivedate=18 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other electoral issues were the [[Quebec Charter of Values]], and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Drainville%20blames%20referendum%20charter%20fall/9737081/story.html|title=Drainville blames referendum, not charter, for PQ fall|first=,Philip|last=Authier|work=montrealgazette.com|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Party like [[Coalition Avenir Québec]] supported the [[Quebec ban on face covering]] but also argue the ban is not extensive enough. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2017/10/quebec-islam-and-face-covering&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Hungary}}
The '''Pensioners' Party''' ({{lang-hu|Nyugdíjasok Pártja}}; '''NYUP'''), was a minor [[political party]] in [[Hungary]] between 1990 and 2007.

==History==
It was founded by the National Association of Pensioners' Associations within the [[Patriotic People's Front]] (HNF) under the name '''Party of Generations, Party of Pensioners and Families''' ({{lang-hu|Nemzedékek Pártja, Nyugdíjasok és Családosok Pártja}}) in January 1990. During its inaugural meeting, jurist Vilmos Michaletzky was elected leader of the party. The NYUP worked for the interests of [[pensioner]]s, and the party mainly focuses on issues related to health care, taxes and pensioners' issues. The party also had a [[Christian socialist]] ideology. The NYUP supported the ideas of family tax benefit and housing subsidies.{{sfn|Vida|2011|p=438}}

Only one candidate of the party run in the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1990|1990 parliamentary election]], who received 0.04 percent of the individual votes, failing to obtain a mandate.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] &amp; Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p. 899. {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However pharmacist and MP [[Imre Barcza]], who had left the [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SZDSZ) caucus earlier, joined the NYUP in October 1992, providing parliamentary representation for the small party. Before the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1994|1994 parliamentary election]], the NYUP negotiated on electoral cooperation with the governing [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]] (MDF).{{sfn|Vida|2011|p=439}} Despite this the party's sole candidate gained only 0.02 percentage.&lt;ref name=NS/&gt; For the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1998|1998 parliamentary election]], it joined the electoral alliance [[Union for Hungary]], the NYUP had four candidates on the alliances' 80-member national list, but they did not reach the 5% [[election threshold]].&lt;ref name=NS/&gt;

The NYUP strongly criticized the electoral system which was not favorable for extra-parliamentary parties. Their petition was rejected by the [[Constitutional Court of Hungary]]. Before the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2002|2002 parliamentary election]], Michaletzky began to negotiate with the internal conflict-ridden [[Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|Christian Democratic People's Party]] (KDNP) to ensure a successful cooperation, however the NYUP withdrawn when the KDNP entered a coalition with the [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party]] (MSZDP).{{sfn|Vida|2011|p=439}} Thus the party did not participate in the election.&lt;ref name=NS/&gt; The NYUP joined the [[Hungarian National Alliance]] (MNSZ) which formed to contest the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Hungary)|2004 European Parliament election]]. On 27 April 2007, the NYUP transformed itself into a civil organization, called Family Protectional Association of Pensioners (NYCSE).{{sfn|Vida|2011|p=439}}

He was a [[Queensland Police]] officer for nine years, working in the Drug Squad in Brisbane in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterdutton.com.au/MeetPeter/AboutPeter.aspx|title=About Peter Dutton|work=PetterDutton.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2013/guide/dick/|title=Dickson|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|work=ABC Elections}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked in the Sex Offenders Squad and the [[National Crime Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://player.whooshkaa.com/shows/sky-news-the-bolt-report|title=Sky News - The Bolt Report|last=|first=|date=|website=Whooshkaa|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a second job, he worked with his father in a building business.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1999, Dutton left the police force to become a businessman, completing a [[Bachelor of Business]] at the [[Queensland University of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=00AKI|title=The Hon Peter Dutton MP|publisher=[[Australian Parliament House]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="age"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/to-some-hes-the-messiah-to-others-a-duplicitous-polly-20091006-glh1.html|title=To some he's the messiah, to others a duplicitous polly|author=Misha Schubert|date=7 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his father founded the business Dutton Holdings, which was registered in 2000; it operated under six different trading and business names.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abr.business.gov.au/|title=ABN Lookup|last=|first=|date=2014-11-01|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815074306/http://abr.business.gov.au/|archive-date=2000-08-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company bought, renovated, and converted buildings into childcare centres, and in 2002 sold three childcare centres to the now defunct [[ABC Learning]].

==Howard Government (2001–07)==
Dutton was elected to the [[Division of Dickson]] at the [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001 election]], defeating Labor's [[Cheryl Kernot]]. He was elevated to the ministry after the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 election]] as [[Minister for Employment Participation (Australia)|Minister for Workforce Participation]], a position he held until January 2006. He was then appointed [[Assistant Treasurer of Australia|Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue]]. He successfully retained Dickson at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 election]], which saw the government lose office. However, his margin was reduced to just 217 votes more than Labor's Fiona McNamara.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/qld/dickson.htm|title=Profile of the electoral division of Dickson|last=|first=|date=|website=Australian Electoral Commission|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition (2007–13)==
Following the 2007 election, Dutton was promoted to [[Shadow Cabinet of Australia|shadow cabinet]] by the new Liberal leader [[Brendan Nelson]], as Shadow Minister for Finance, Competition Policy and Deregulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nelson Shadow Ministry|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/05%20About%20Parliament/54%20Parliamentary%20Depts/544%20Parliamentary%20Library/Handbook/ShadowMinistry_6dec07-22sep08.pdf?la=en|website=Parliament of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he chose not to be present in the chamber during the apology to the [[Stolen Generations]], which enjoyed bipartisan support.&lt;ref name="age" /&gt; He said "I regarded it as something which was not going to deliver tangible outcomes to kids who are being raped and tortured in communities in the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Morning Herald]], Dutton said he regretted boycotting the apology: "I underestimated the symbolic and cultural significance of it."&lt;ref
name=":2" /&gt;

In September 2008, Nelson was replaced as Liberal leader by [[Malcolm Turnbull]], who appointed Dutton as Shadow Minister for Health and Ageing. He retained that position when [[Tony Abbott]] succeeded Turnbull as leader in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turnbull Shadow Ministry|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/05%20About%20Parliament/54%20Parliamentary%20Depts/544%20Parliamentary%20Library/Handbook/ShadowMinistry_22sep2008-23jan2009.pdf?la=en|website=Parliament of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, Dutton released the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]]'s mental health policy. It received favourable reviews, with ''[[The Australian]]'' describing it as "the most significant announcement by any political party in relation to a targeted, evidence-based investment in mental health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cresswell|first1=Adam|title=Experts hail a policy 'game-changer'|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/experts-hail-a-policy-game-changer/story-e6frg6n6-1225886440963|agency=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutton retained his seat with a positive swing at the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]], despite an unfavourable redistribution. In the lead-up to the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]], he announced a range of Coalition health policies, which were received favourably by industry groups. The [[Australian Medical Association]] said "the Coalition has delivered a strong package of practical, affordable health policies that would strengthen general practice",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coalition has been listening on health policy|url=https://ama.com.au/media/coalition-has-been-listening-health-policy|website=AMA}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Cancer Council Australia]] said that "Dutton’s promise to finalise the bowel cancer screening program by 2020 would save an additional 35,000 lives over the next 40 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Health Minister Peter Dutton set to save 35,000 Australian lives, says Cancer Council|url=http://www.cancer.org.au/news/media-releases/new-health-minister-peter-dutton-set-to-save-35000-australian-lives-says-cancer-council.html|website=Cancer Council Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted seat shift===
As the 2010 election approached, it looked like Dutton would lose to the Labor candidate due to a redistribution of division boundaries that had erased his majority and made Dickson notionally Labor. To safeguard himself, Dutton sought pre-selection for the merged [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]] in the safe Liberal seat of [[Division of McPherson|McPherson]] on the Gold Coast (despite not living in or near McPherson).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/doorknocking-dutton-has-work-cut-out-20091020-h75g.html|title=Door-knocking Dutton has work cut out|last=Calligeros|first=Marissa|date=2009-10-22|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-06-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some constituents complained, "The abandoning of a seat by a sitting MP halfway through a parliamentary term to contest pre-selection in a seat over 100 kilometres to the south is not looked upon favourably."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crikey.com.au/2009/09/23/constituents-not-happy-about-dutton-dumping-dickson/|title=Constituents not happy about Dutton dumping Dickson|date=2009-09-23|website=Crikey|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutton lost the McPherson pre-selection to [[Karen Andrews]], reportedly due to misgivings from former Nationals in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.crikey.com.au/pollbludger/fed2016/dickson/ Federal Election 2016: Dickson&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He then asked the LNP to "deliver him a seat for which he doesn't have to fight other preselection candidates." Liberal MP [[Alex Somlyay]] (the chief Opposition whip of the time) said that Dutton's expectation of an uncontested preselection was "unusual."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/dutton-seeks-seat-without-a-struggle-20091006-glh0.html|title=Dutton seeks seat without a struggle|last=Grattan|first=Michelle|date=2009-10-07|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-06-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the state executive didn't provide Dutton an unchallenged preselection, Dutton reluctantly returned to campaign for the seat of Dickson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-10-20/dutton-to-fight-for-dickson/1111186|title=Dutton to fight for Dickson|date=2009-10-20|work=ABC News|access-date=2017-06-03|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Dickson Decides|date=2009-10-23|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-10-23/dickson-decides/1115388|language=en-AU|accessdate=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cabinet minister (2013–present)==
{{see also|Abbott Government|Turnbull Government}}

=== Minister for Health ===

Dutton retained his seat at the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 election]]. He was appointed to the [[Abbott Ministry|Ministry]] by then Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]], and served as [[Minister for Health (Australia)|Minister for Health]] and [[Minister for Sport (Australia)|Minister for Sport]].

As Health Minister, Dutton announced the world-leading $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund. As announced, the capital and any ongoing capital gains of the Medical Research Future Fund will be preserved in perpetuity.

Under Minister Dutton, projected funding in the health portfolio increased in the 2014-15 Budget to $66.9 billion, an increase of 7.5 percent from $62.2 billion in 2012-13, the final full year of the Labor Government. Projected expenditure on Medicare increased over 9.5 percent from $18.5 billion in 2012-13 under Labor to a projected $20.32 billion in 2014-15 under Dutton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Budget 2014-15|url=http://www.budget.gov.au/2014-15/content/bp1/download/BP1_combined.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Budget 2013-14|url=http://www.budget.gov.au/2013-14/content/bp1/html/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for public hospital services increased by nearly 14 percent under Dutton in the 2014-15 Budget to a projected $15.12 billion compared to $13.28 billion in the last full year of the Labor Government in 2012-13.

In a 2015 poll by ''Australian Doctor'' magazine, Dutton was voted the worst health minister in the last 35 years by 46 percent of respondents. However, only 1,100 out of the magazine's 20,000 readers voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Dutton ranked as worst health minister in 35 years in poll of doctors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jan/12/peter-dutton-ranked-as-worst-health-minister-in-35-years-in-poll-of-doctors|website=Guardian Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 2015, Dutton denied claims made by [[Australian Greens|Greens]] Senator [[Sarah Hanson-Young]] that she was spied on
during a visit to Nauru. At the same time he called into question her
credibility saying "she's written to me on some issues which are completely fanciful when you have a look at the facts and she's got a track record of making these things up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In June 2015, an [[au pair]] who was detained at Brisbane Airport made a phone call and had her tourist visa reinstated.  In November, in a second case, Dutton granted a visa to another au pair, despite his department warning him that she was at risk of breaching her work conditions on her tourist visa.  Dutton indicated that he knew neither tourist.

==== Manus Island ====
On 15 April 2017 shots were fired by the Papua New Guinea defence force into the [[Manus Regional Processing Centre|Manus Island Detention Centre]]. Dutton responded saying "There was difficulty, as I understand it, in the community. There was an alleged incident where three asylum seekers were alleged to be leading a local five year old boy back toward the facility and there was a lot of angst around that, if you like, within the local PNG community."

On 31 October 2017, the Papuan Government closed down the Manus Island regional processing centre. However, 600 men residing in the processing centre refused to be moved to alternative accommodation in the town of [[Lorengau]] and staged a protest. Dutton defended the closure of the processing centre and asserted that the Papuan authorities had given notice of the camp's impending closure in May 2017.

In mid November 2017, Dutton rejected an offer by the newly-elected [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|New Zealand Prime Minister]] [[Jacinda Ardern]] to resettle 150 asylum seekers from the Manus Island detention centre in New Zealand and warned that it would have repercussions for the two countries' bilateral relations. He also claimed that New Zealand's offer would encourage people smugglers. Dutton also criticised a New Zealand offer to provide $3 million for services for asylum seekers on Manus and Nauru as a "waste of money" that could be spend elsewhere, such as displaced people in Indonesia. In addition, Dutton criticised Australia's [[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|Opposition Leader]] [[Bill Shorten]]'s call for Australia to accept the New Zealand offer as an attempt to appease the [[Labor Left]] with "cheap political stunts and mealy-mouthed words".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Belot |first1=Henry |title=Malcolm Turnbull not accepting Jacinda Ardern's offer to resettle asylum seekers in NZ 'at this time' |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-05/turnbull-wont-accept-nz-offer-to-resettle-refugees-at-this-time/9120028 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carp |first1=Paul |last2=Roy |first2=Eleanor Ainge |title=New Zealand seeks deal with Australia to resettle Manus and Nauru refugees |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/17/new-zealand-and-png-could-do-deal-on-refugees-peter-dutton-says |accessdate=19 July 2018 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Immigration from New Zealand ====
As both Immigration Minister and Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton has defended an amendment to the Migration Act 1958 that facilitates the denial or  cancellation of Australian visas for non-citizens on "character" grounds. This stringent "character test" also affects non-citizens who have lived most of their lives in Australia or who have families living in the country.&lt;ref name="AustLII"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ma1958118|Migration Act 1958|501}} Refusal or cancellation of visa on character grounds.&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand nationals living in Australia were disproportionately affected by this "character test" with over 1,300 New Zealanders having been deported from Australia in the period between January 2015 and July 2018.&lt;ref name="ABC Don't call Australia Home"&gt;{{cite news |title=Don't Call Australia Home! |url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/don%E2%80%99t-call-australia-home!/10005152 |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT NZ fury"&gt;{{cite news |last1=O'Regan |first1=Slyvia Varnham |title=Why New Zealand Is Furious About Australia’s Deportation Policy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/world/asia/new-zealand-australia-deportations.html |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' |date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[Department of Home Affairs (Australia)|Home Affairs Department]] report, 620 New Zealanders had their visas cancelled on character grounds in 2017 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key visa cancellation statistics |url=https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about/reports-publications/research-statistics/statistics/key-cancellation-statistics |publisher=[[Department of Home Affairs (Australia)|Department of Home Affairs]] |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Dutton's [[Department of Immigration and Border Protection]] introduced a special Skilled Independent subclass 189 visa to provide a pathway for New Zealanders holding a Special Category Visa to acquire Australian citizenship. The visa requires NZ nationals to have held a Special Category Visa for five years and to maintain an annual income of $53,900. Between 60,000 and 80,000 New Zealanders residing in Australia are eligible for the Skilled Independent subclass 189 visa. By February 2018, 1,512 skilled independent visas had been issued by late February 2018 with another 7,500 visas still being processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goethe-Snape |first1=Jackson |title=Government's immigration tweak sees overseas Asians out, integrated Kiwis in |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-13/how-dutton-slowed-immigration/9646602 |accessdate=21 July 2018 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 13 April 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Karp |first1=Paul |title=Visa pathway for New Zealanders resident in Australia will cut migrant intake |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/13/visa-pathway-for-new-zealanders-resident-in-australia-will-cut-migrant-intake |accessdate=21 July 2018 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=13 April 1018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Skilled Independent subclass 189 visa was criticised by Australian Greens Senator Nick McKim as a stealth means of favouring "English-speaking, white and wealthy" migrants.&lt;ref name="Guardian 13 April 2018" /&gt;

In early July 2018, Dutton ordered the deportation of controversial New Zealand [[Baptists|Baptist]] Pastor Logan Robertson, who had disrupted services at two mosques in [[Kuraby, Queensland|Kuraby]] and [[Darra, Queensland|Darra]] in Brisbane. Dutton approved Robertson's visa cancellation on the grounds that he had violated the conditions of his visa, stating that "we have a wonderful tradition in our country of freedom of speech, but we're not going to tolerate people going to a place of worship and harassing others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crockford |first1=Toby |title=NZ pastor to be deported from Australia after public nuisance charges |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/australia/105319868/nz-pastor-to-be-deported-from-australia-after-public-nuisance-charges |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Small |first1=Zane |title=Deported NZ pastor Logan Robertson shows no remorse for harassing 'sissy' Muslims |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/07/deported-nz-pastor-logan-robertson-shows-no-remorse-for-harassing-sissy-muslims.html |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deported NZ pastor Logan Robertson doesn't regret harassing Muslims |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12097253 |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' |date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson had early drawn controversy in New Zealand for his [[homophobia|homophobic]] remarks and opposition to [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bath |first1=Brooke |title=Auckland pastor goes on rant, says gay people should be shot |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/95818245/auckland-pastor-goes-on-antigay-rant?rm=m |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutton was defeated by Treasurer and Acting Home Affairs Minister [[Scott Morrison]] by 45 votes to 40.

Doubts surrounding Dutton's eligibility to be elected to parliament emerged on the grounds of [[Section 44 of the Constitution of Australia#(v) Pecuniary interest in an agreement with the Commonwealth|section 44(v) of the Australian Constitution]], as the [[family trust]] owned by Dutton operated a [[child care]] centre that received over $5.6 million in funding from the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]], in a situation similar to [[Re Day (No 2)|Bob Day's case]].  Although Dutton had received legal advice stating that he was not in breach of section 44(v), Labor had received contrary advice;  at Turnbull's request, the [[Attorney-General for Australia|Attorney-General]] referred the matter to the [[Solicitor-General of Australia|Solicitor-General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-refers-dutton-s-eligibility-to-solicitor-general-20180822-p4zyy6.html |title=Government refers Dutton's eligibility to Solicitor-General |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=22 August 2018 |last1=Loussikian |first1=Kylar |last2=McCauley |first2=Dana}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 23 August, Labor attempted to move a motion to refer Dutton's eligibility as an MP to the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]], in a similar manner to referrals made during [[2017–18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis|the recent parliamentary citizenship crisis]].

In March 2017, 31 CEOs signed a letter to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull calling for a free vote in the Australian Parliament on same-sex marriage. In response to this letter, on 16 March 2017, Dutton said that the CEOs "shouldn't shove their views down our throats" and that CEOs who were "doing the wrong thing" should "be publicly shamed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Dutton’s comments were heavily criticised as an attempt to censor
expressions of support for same-sex marriage, with some commenters
also accusing him of hypocrisy given his support for changing

===Negative gearing===
Dutton, who owns six properties with his wife, including a shopping centre in [[Townsville]], opposes any changes to [[negative gearing]] which currently offers tax breaks to property investors, stating that changing it would harm the economy.&lt;ref name="cadzow"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cadzow|first1=Jane|title=Peter Dutton: 'I'm just not impacted by that hatred'|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/good-weekend/peter-dutton-im-just-not-impacted-by-that-hatred-20170516-gw5pt1.html|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=Brisbane Times|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Dutton married his first wife when he was 22 years of age; however, the marriage ended after a few months.

Pictured here is the exterior of Shata Prison in [[Israel]], which is secured through the use of high fences, [[razor wire]], [[protective barriers]], [[guard towers]], and security lighting.]] 
'''Physical security''' describes [[security]] measures that are designed to deny unauthorized access to facilities, equipment and resources and to protect personnel and property from damage or harm (such as [[espionage]], [[theft]], or [[terrorist]] attacks).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Field Manual 3-19.30: Physical Security|publisher=Headquarters, United States Department of Army|year=2001|chapter=Chapter 1: Physical Security Challenges|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-19-30/ch1.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313232001/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-19-30/ch1.htm|archivedate=2013-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical security involves the use of multiple layers of interdependent systems which include [[CCTV]] surveillance, [[security guards]], [[protective barriers]], [[Lock (security device)|locks]], [[access control]] protocols, and many other techniques.

* deter potential intruders (e.g. warning signs and perimeter markings);
* detect intrusions and monitor/record intruders (e.g. intruder alarms and CCTV systems); and
* trigger appropriate incident responses (e.g. by security guards and police).

It is up to security designers, architects and analysts to balance security controls against risks, taking into account the costs of specifying, developing, testing, implementing, using, managing, monitoring and maintaining the controls, along with broader issues such as [[aesthetics]], [[human rights]], health and safety, and societal norms or conventions.  Physical access security measures that are appropriate for a high security [[prison]] or a military site may be inappropriate in an office, a home or a vehicle, although the principles are similar.

==Elements and design==

=== Deterrence methods ===
{{Main article|Natural surveillance|Crime prevention through environmental design}}
The goal of ''deterrence'' methods is to convince potential attackers that a successful attack is unlikely due to strong defenses.

The initial layer of security for a campus, building, office, or other physical space uses [[crime prevention through environmental design]] to deter threats. Some of the most common examples are also the most basic: warning signs or window stickers, [[fence]]s, vehicle barriers, vehicle height-restrictors, restricted access points, [[security lighting]] and trenches.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion on natural surveillance and CPTED, see {{cite book|author=Fennelly, Lawrence J.|title=Effective Physical Security|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2012|isbn=9780124158924|pages=4–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hfuODGScv_0C&amp;pg=PA4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105015948/https://books.google.com/books?id=hfuODGScv_0C&amp;pg=PA4|archivedate=2018-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PhysicalSecurity"&gt;{{cite book| author = Task Committee| author2 = Structural Engineering Institute| title = Structural Design for Physical Security| year = 1999| publisher = ASCE| isbn = 978-0-7844-0457-7| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1j5TNJCwI6wC&amp;printsec=frontcover| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180105015948/https://books.google.com/books?id=1j5TNJCwI6wC&amp;printsec=frontcover| archivedate = 2018-01-05| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Baker, Paul R.|chapter=Security Construction Projects|editor=Baker, Paul R.|editor2=Benny, Daniel J.|title=The Complete Guide to Physical Security|publisher=CRC Press|year=2012|isbn=9781420099638|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7U6Lc2ZYaYC&amp;pg=PA47|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105015948/https://books.google.com/books?id=U7U6Lc2ZYaYC&amp;pg=PA47|archivedate=2018-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Field Manual 3-19.30: Physical Security|publisher=Headquarters, United States Department of Army|year=2001|chapter=Chapter 4: Protective Barriers|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-19-30/ch4.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313231758/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-19-30/ch4.htm|archivedate=2013-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physical barriers====
[[File:Security spikes 1.jpg|thumb|right|Spikes atop a barrier wall act as a deterrent to people trying to climb over the wall]]
Physical barriers such as fences, walls, and vehicle barriers act as the outermost layer of security. They serve to prevent, or at least delay, attacks, and also act as a psychological deterrent by defining the perimeter of the facility and making intrusions seem more difficult. Tall fencing, topped with barbed wire, razor wire or metal spikes are often emplaced on the perimeter of a property, generally with some type of signage that warns people not to attempt to enter. However, in some facilities imposing perimeter walls/fencing will not be possible (e.g. an urban office building that is directly adjacent to public sidewalks) or it may be aesthetically unacceptable (e.g. surrounding a shopping center with tall fences topped with razor wire); in this case, the outer security perimeter will be defined as the walls/windows/doors of the structure itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Talbot, Julian|author2=Jakeman, Miles|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Security Risk Management Body of Knowledge|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=9781118211267|pages=72–73|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5xAhp9B1264C&amp;pg=PT73|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105015948/https://books.google.com/books?id=5xAhp9B1264C&amp;pg=PT73|archivedate=2018-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=====Combination barriers=====
[[Image:Pannzerung plastische deformation.png|thumb|right|Steel-based armour, exhibiting [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic deformation]] as a result of [[projectile]] [[Impact (mechanics)|impacts]]. Plastic deformation as a result of impact can knock loose, tear or squish [[passive fire protection]] (PFP) materials, particularly once the PFP materials are stressed. Some PFP materials can at times be very resilient, impact resistant and ductile ''at ambient''. Once stressed by fire, that can change as free water dissipates at 100°C (212°F), and hydrates can be spent near 300°C (572°F), all of which is reached within minutes of a fire. Construction level binders, unlike certain refractories, can also degrade with heat, thus changing the physical properties of many PFP materials across different temperature ranges. None of that is normally a problem. In fact it is part of PFP designs for different reasons. But when combining PFP with ballistics or fragmentation, it is prudent to consider all relevant stresses in designing barriers that must (or may be presumed or advertised to) simultaneously defeat fire, followed by hose stream and impacts that come during a fire event.]]
Barriers are typically designed to defeat defined threats. This is part of [[building code]]s as well as fire codes. Apart from external threats, there are internal threats of [[fire]], smoke migration as well as sabotage. The National Building Code of Canada, as an example, indicates the need to defeat external explosions with the [[building envelope]], where they are possible, such as where large electrical [[transformer]]s are located close to a building. [[High-voltage transformer fire barriers]] can be examples of walls designed to simultaneously defeat fire, ballistics and fragmentation as a result of transformer ruptures, as well as incoming small weapons fire. Similarly, buildings may have internal barriers to defeat weapons as well as fire and heat. An example would be a counter at a police station or embassy, where the public may access a room but talk through security glass to employees in behind. If such a barrier aligns with a fire compartment as part of building code compliance, then multiple threats must be defeated simultaneously, which must be considered in the design.

====Natural surveillance====
Another major form of deterrence that can be incorporated into the design of facilities is [[natural surveillance]], whereby architects seek to build spaces that are more open and visible to security personnel and authorized users, so that intruders/attackers are unable to perform unauthorized activity without being seen. An example would be decreasing the amount of dense, tall vegetation in the [[landscaping]] so that attackers cannot conceal themselves within it, or placing critical resources in areas where intruders would have to cross over a wide, open space to reach them (making it likely that someone would notice them).

====Security lighting====
Security lighting is another effective form of deterrence. Intruders are less likely to enter well-lit areas for fear of being seen. Doors, gates, and other entrances, in particular, should be well lit to allow close observation of people entering and exiting. When lighting the grounds of a facility, widely distributed low-intensity lighting is generally superior to small patches of high-intensity lighting, because the latter can have a tendency to create blind spots for security personnel and CCTV cameras. It is important to place lighting in a manner that makes it difficult to tamper with (e.g. suspending lights from tall poles), and to ensure that there is a backup power supply so that security lights will not go out if the electricity is cut off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kovacich, Gerald L.|author2=Halibozek, Edward P.|last-author-amp=yes|title=The Manager's Handbook for Corporate Security: Establishing and Managing a Successful Assets Protection Program|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2003|isbn=9780750674874|pages=192–193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZ9_hnqNpH0C&amp;pg=PA193|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105015948/https://books.google.com/books?id=WZ9_hnqNpH0C&amp;pg=PA193|archivedate=2018-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intrusion detection and electronic surveillance===
{{Main article|Surveillance}}

====Alarm systems and sensors====
{{Main article|CCTV}}
{{Main article|Security alarms}}
[[Alarm systems]] can be installed to alert security personnel when unauthorized access is attempted. Alarm systems work in tandem with physical barriers, mechanical systems, and security guards, serving to trigger a response when these other forms of security have been breached. They consist of sensors including [[motion sensors]], contact sensors, and [[glass break detector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Field Manual 3-19.30: Physical Security|publisher=Headquarters, United States Department of Army|year=2001|chapter=Chapter 6: Electronic Security Systems|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-19-30/ch6.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313231931/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-19-30/ch6.htm|archivedate=2013-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, alarms are only useful if there is a prompt response when they are triggered. In the reconnaissance phase prior to an actual attack, some intruders will test the response time of security personnel to a deliberately tripped alarm system. By measuring the length of time it takes for a security team to arrive (if they arrive at all), the attacker can determine if an attack could succeed before authorities arrive to neutralize the threat. Loud audible alarms can also act as a psychological deterrent, by notifying intruders that their presence has been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fennelly, Lawrence J.|title=Effective Physical Security|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2012|isbn=9780124158924|pages=345–346|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hfuODGScv_0C&amp;pg=PA345|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921072054/http://books.google.com/books?id=hfuODGScv_0C&amp;pg=PA345|archivedate=2013-09-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions, law enforcement will not respond to alarms from intrusion detection systems unless the activation has been verified by an eyewitness or video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isc.temple.edu/economics/wkpapers/Pubs/FalsePolicy.pdf |title=Evaluation of alternative policies to combat false emergency calls |page=238 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101083705/http://isc.temple.edu/economics/wkpapers/Pubs/FalsePolicy.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Policies like this one have been created to combat the 94&amp;ndash;99 percent rate of false alarm activation in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isc.temple.edu/economics/wkpapers/Pubs/FalsePolicy.pdf |title=Evaluation of alternative policies to combat false emergency calls |page=233 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101083705/http://isc.temple.edu/economics/wkpapers/Pubs/FalsePolicy.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Video surveillance====
[[File:Surveillance quevaal.jpg|thumb|right|Closed-circuit television cameras]]
{{Main article|CCTV}}
''Surveillance cameras'' can be a deterrent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urban.org/uploadedpdf/412401-Evaluating-the-Use-of-Public-Surveillance-Cameras-for-Crime-Control-and-Prevention-A-Summary.pdf |title=Evaluating the Use of Public Surveillance Cameras for Crime Control and Prevention |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201231521/http://www.urban.org/uploadedpdf/412401-Evaluating-the-Use-of-Public-Surveillance-Cameras-for-Crime-Control-and-Prevention-A-Summary.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; when placed in highly visible locations, and are also useful for incident verification and historical analysis. For example, if alarms are being generated and there is a camera in place, the camera could be viewed to verify the alarms. In instances when an attack has already occurred and a camera is in place at the point of attack, the recorded video can be reviewed. Although the term [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV) is common, it is quickly becoming outdated as more video systems lose the closed circuit for signal transmission and are instead transmitting on [[IP camera]] networks.

Video monitoring does not necessarily guarantee that a human response is made to an intrusion. A human must be monitoring the situation in real time in order to respond in a timely manner.  Otherwise, video monitoring is simply a means to gather evidence to be analyzed at a later time. However, advances in information technology are reducing the amount of work required for video monitoring, through automated [[video analytics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crowell, William P.|editor=Cole, Eric|chapter=Intelligent Video Analytics|title=Physical and Logical Security Convergence|publisher=Syngress|year=2011|isbn=9780080558783|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a4h_c4TqZM4C&amp;pg=PA445|display-authors=etal|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105015948/https://books.google.com/books?id=a4h_c4TqZM4C&amp;pg=PA445|archivedate=2018-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dufour, Jean-Yves|title=Intelligent Video Surveillance Systems|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=9781118577868|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YYGIFHgxFIgC&amp;printsec=frontcover|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105015948/https://books.google.com/books?id=YYGIFHgxFIgC&amp;printsec=frontcover|archivedate=2018-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Caputo, Anthony C.|title=Digital Video Surveillance and Security|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2010|isbn=9780080961699|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nf40glaXZooC&amp;printsec=frontcover|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929052842/http://books.google.com/books?id=Nf40glaXZooC&amp;printsec=frontcover|archivedate=2013-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Access control ===
{{Main article|Access control}}

[[Access control]] methods are used to monitor and control traffic through specific access points and areas of the secure facility. This is done using a variety of systems including [[CCTV]] [[surveillance]], [[identification cards]], [[security guards]], and electronic/mechanical control systems such as locks, doors, turnstiles and gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tyska, Louis A.|author2=Fennelly, Lawrence J.|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Physical Security: 150 Things You Should Know|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2000|isbn=9780750672559|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XQuUY8FSq5EC&amp;pg=PA3|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105015948/https://books.google.com/books?id=XQuUY8FSq5EC&amp;pg=PA3|archivedate=2018-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Field Manual 3-19.30: Physical Security|publisher=Headquarters, United States Department of Army|year=2001|chapter=Chapter 7: Access Control|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-19-30/ch7.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510060217/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-19-30/ch7.htm|archivedate=2007-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pearson, Robert|chapter=Chapter 1: Electronic Access Control|title=Electronic Security Systems: A Manager's Guide to Evaluating and Selecting System Solutions|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2011|isbn=9780080494708|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnR-lR0nikgC&amp;pg=PA1|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105015948/https://books.google.com/books?id=pnR-lR0nikgC&amp;pg=PA1|archivedate=2018-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mechanical access control systems====
[[File:Q-Lane Space Saver Turnstiles.jpg|thumb|A drop arm optical turnstile]]
[[File:1-Wire lock.jpg|thumb|right|An electronic access control system, controlling entry through a door.]]
{{Main article|Lock (security device)}}
''Mechanical access control systems'' include turnstiles, gates, doors, and locks. [[Key management (access control)|Key control]] of the locks becomes a problem with large user populations and any user turnover. [[Key (lock)|Keys]] quickly become unmanageable, often forcing the adoption of electronic access control.

====Electronic access control systems====
''Electronic access control'' manages large user populations, controlling for user lifecycles times, dates, and individual access points. For example, a user's access rights could allow access from 0700h to 1900h Monday through Friday and expires in 90 days.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} These access control systems are often interfaced with turnstiles for entry control in buildings to prevent unauthorized access. The use of turnstiles also reduces the need for additional security personnel to monitor each individual entering the building allowing faster throughput.

An additional sub-layer of mechanical/electronic access control protection is reached by integrating a [[key management]] system to manage the possession and usage of mechanical keys to locks or property within a building or campus.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

====Identification systems and access policies====
Another form of access control (''procedural'') includes the use of policies, processes and procedures to manage the ingress into the restricted area. An example of this is the deployment of security personnel conducting checks for authorized entry at predetermined points of entry. This form of access control is usually supplemented by the earlier forms of access control (i.e. mechanical and electronic access control), or simple devices such as physical passes.

=== Security personnel ===
{{Main article|Security guard}}
[[File:Private factory guard.jpg|thumb|right|Private factory guard]]
''Security personnel'' play a central role in all layers of security. All of the technological systems that are employed to enhance physical security are useless without a security force that is trained in their use and maintenance, and which knows how to properly respond to breaches in security. Security personnel perform many functions: as patrols and at checkpoints, to administer electronic access control, to respond to alarms, and to monitor and analyze video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reid, Robert N.|chapter=Guards and guard forces|title=Facility Manager's Guide to Security: Protecting Your Assets|publisher=The Fairmont Press|year=2005|isbn=9780881734836|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rqFQdGnyXsYC&amp;pg=PA237|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105015948/https://books.google.com/books?id=rqFQdGnyXsYC&amp;pg=PA237|archivedate=2018-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rashtriya Ulama Council''' (RUC') is a [[political party]] in [[India]] formed in 2008.

==History==
RUC came into existence on 4 October 2008 and was originally called the Ulama Council. It began as a [[protest group]] after two youths from Azamgarh were killed in the Batla House near the area of [[Jamia Nagar]], New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://twocircles.net/2012sep20/ulama_council_protest_batla_house_encounter_anniversary_azamgarh.html | author= | title=Ulama Council protest on Batla House encounter anniversary in Azamgarh | date=September 20, 2012 | accessdate=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the initiative of Maulana [[Aamir Rashadi Madni]] and Maulana [[Tahir Madni]], calling a meeting of religious clerics in [[Uttar Pradesh]], in particular regions of Azamgarh and nearby areas on 4 October 2008.

The Ulama Council booked a train on 29 January 2009 and took thousands of citizens from Azamgarh, Jaunpur, Faizabad, Lucknow, Aligarh, Bijnour, Delhi to protest against the central government and asked for a judicial probe of the encounter. On 20 February 2009, RUC booked two trains and took thousands to convey their protest against the state government. The Ulama Council became a mass movement and transformed into the Rashtriya Ulama Council, a full fledged political party. The party is pursuing the Batla House case through both protests and legal means.

==2009 parliamentary elections==

RUC participated in the 2009 parliamentary elections on 5 seats and as expected RUC didn’t win any seat but they secured approximately 2.25 lakh (225,000) votes, unusually successful for a party that was only five months old. It did not ally with other parties.

==2012 Assembly Election==
RUC participated in the Uttar Pradesh 2012 Assembly election, contesting 100 seats out of 401. As expected, the RUC did not win any seats, but they secured nearly 6 lakh (600,000) votes.

The '''Rural Secretariat''' was a focal point for the [[Government of Canada]] to work in partnership with Canadians in rural and remote areas to build strong, dynamic communities.  It was dismantled by the Conservative government in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.producer.com/daily/feds-abolish-rural-secretariat/|title=Feds abolish Rural Secretariat|accessdate=2014-10-25|publisher=The Western Producer}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Located in [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada]], it provided leadership and coordination for the Canadian Rural Partnership; facilitated liaison and creation of partnerships around rural issues and priorities; and promoted dialogue between rural stakeholders and the federal government.

Key activities of the Rural Secretariat included:
*seeking input of rural Canadians through the Rural Dialogue so the federal government could better understand and respond to local and regional issues;
*conducting an Information Outreach program to promote awareness of federal programs and services for rural Canadians;
*promoting use of the "Rural Lens" to ensure that rural concerns were considered throughout the federal government;
*conducting and supporting research and analysis of economic and social issues affecting rural Canada;
*coordinating a partnership approach on rural issues across the federal government, through the provincial and territorial Rural Teams;
*providing one-stop access to information of particular interest to rural Canadians through the Canadian Rural Information Service.

The [[Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food]] was responsible for the Rural Secretariat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22811">The '''science wars''' is a series of [[intellectual]] exchanges, between [[Scientific realism|scientific realists]] and [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] critics, about the nature of scientific theory and intellectual inquiry. They took place principally in the [[United States]] in the 1990s in the academic and mainstream press. Scientific realists (such as [[Norman Levitt]], [[Paul R. Gross]], [[Jean Bricmont]] and [[Alan Sokal]]) argued that scientific knowledge is real, and accused the postmodernists of having effectively rejected scientific [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]],  the [[scientific method]], [[Empiricism]], and scientific knowledge.  Postmodernists interpreted [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ideas about [[scientific paradigm]]s to mean that scientific theories are [[social constructs]], and philosophers like [[Paul Feyerabend]] argued that other, non-realist forms of knowledge production were better suited to serve people's personal and spiritual needs.

Though much of the theory associated with 'postmodernism' (see [[poststructuralism]]) did not make any interventions into the [[natural sciences]], the scientific realists took aim at its general influence. The scientific realists argued that large swaths of scholarship, amounting to a rejection of objectivity and realism, had been influenced by major 20th Century [[poststructuralist]] philosophers (such as [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and others), whose work they declare to be incomprehensible or meaningless. They implicate a broad range of fields in this trend, including  [[cultural studies]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[feminist studies]], [[comparative literature]], [[media studies]], and [[science and technology studies]]. They accuse those postmodernist critics who did actually discuss science of having a limited understanding of it.

==Historical background==
Until the mid-20th century, the [[philosophy of science]] had concentrated on the viability of scientific method and knowledge, proposing justifications for the truth of scientific theories and observations and attempting to discover at a philosophical level why science worked. 
[[Karl Popper]], an early opponent of [[logical positivism]] in the 20th century, repudiated the classical observationalist/[[Inductivism|inductivist]] form of [[scientific method]] in favour of [[Falsifiability|empirical falsification]]. He is also known for his opposition to the classical [[justificationism|justificationist]] account of knowledge which he replaced with [[critical rationalism]], "the first ''non justificational philosophy of criticism'' in the history of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;[[William W. Bartley|Bartley, William W.]] (1964). [http://www.the-rathouse.com/2008/Bartley1964CCR.html "Rationality versus the Theory of Rationality".] In Mario Bunge: ''The Critical Approach to Science and Philosophy''. The Free Press of Glencoe, section IX.&lt;/ref&gt;
His criticisms of scientific method were adopted by several postmodernist critiques.&lt;ref&gt;
[[David Stove|Stove, David Charles]] (1982). ''[[Popper and After]]: [http://ontology.buffalo.edu/stove/500-600.htm Four Modern Irrationalists]'', Oxford: [[Pergamon Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of 20th-century philosophers maintained that logical models of pure science do not apply to actual scientific practice. It was the publication of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' in 1962, however, which fully opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that it did not operate under the simple logical laws put forward by the logical positivist school of philosophy.

Kuhn described the development of scientific knowledge not as a linear increase in truth and understanding, but as a series of periodic revolutions which overturned the old scientific order and replaced it with new orders (what he called "[[paradigm]]s"). Kuhn attributed much of this process to the interactions and strategies of the human participants in science rather than its own innate logical structure. (See [[sociology of scientific knowledge]]).

Some interpreted Kuhn's ideas to mean that scientific theories were, either wholly or in part, ''[[social construction|social constructs]]'', which many interpreted as diminishing the claim of science to representing objective reality (though many social constructivists do not put forward this claim), and that reality had a lesser or potentially irrelevant role in the formation of scientific theories. In 1971,  [[Jerome Ravetz]] published ''[[Scientific knowledge and its social problems|Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems]]'', a book describing the role that the scientific community, as a social construct, plays in accepting or rejecting objective scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="isbn0195197216 "&gt;{{cite book |author=Ravetz, Jerome R. |title=Scientific knowledge and its social problems |publisher=Oxford Univ. Press |location=Oxford |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=978-0-19-519721-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Postmodernism ===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
{{Further information|New Left|Critical theory}}
A number of different philosophical and historical schools, often grouped together as "[[postmodernism]]", began reinterpreting scientific achievements of the past through the lens of the practitioners, often positing the influence of politics and economics in the development of scientific theories in addition to scientific observations. Rather than being presented as working entirely from positivistic observations, many scientists of the past were scrutinized for their connection to issues of gender, sexual orientation, race, and class. Some more radical philosophers, such as [[Paul Feyerabend]], argued that scientific theories were themselves incoherent and that other forms of knowledge production (such as those used in [[religion]]) served the material and spiritual needs of their practitioners with equal validity as did scientific explanations.

[[Imre Lakatos]] advanced a midway view between the "postmodernist" and "realist" camps. For Lakatos, scientific knowledge is progressive; however, it progresses not by a strict linear path where every new element builds upon and incorporates every other, but by an approach where a "core" of a "research program" is established by auxiliary theories which can themselves be falsified or replaced without compromising the core. Social conditions and attitudes affect how strongly one attempts to resist falsification for the core of a program, but the program has an objective status based on its relative explanatory power. Resisting falsification only becomes ''ad-hoc'' and damaging to knowledge when an alternate program with greater explanatory power is rejected in favor of another with less. But because it is changing a theoretical core, which has broad ramifications for other areas of study, accepting a new program is also revolutionary as well as progressive. Thus, for Lakatos the character of science is that of being both revolutionary and progressive; both socially informed and objectively justified.

==The science wars==
In ''[[Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science]]'' (1994), the scientists [[Paul R. Gross]] and [[Norman Levitt]] accused postmodernists of [[anti-intellectualism]], presented the shortcomings of [[relativism]], and suggested that postmodernists knew little about the scientific theories they criticized and practiced poor [[scholarly method|scholarship]] for political reasons. 
The authors insist that the "science critics" misunderstood the theoretical approaches they criticized, given their "caricature, misreading, and condescension, [rather] than argument".&lt;ref&gt;Flower, Michael J.  (1995). "Review of ''Higher Superstition'' ", ''Contemporary Sociology'', Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 113–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'' (Vol. 87, No. 2, 1996), ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' (Vol. 98, No. 2, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Social Studies of Science]]'' (Vol. 26, No. 1, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The review in ''[[The Journal of Higher Education]]'' (Vol. 66, No. 5, 1995) snidely suggested that book's final sentence proved that politics, the epistemology, philosophy, and science are inter-related.&lt;/ref&gt; The book sparked the so-called science wars. ''Higher Superstition'' inspired a [[New York Academy of Sciences]] conference titled ''The Flight from Science and Reason'', organized by Gross, Levitt, and [[Gerald Holton]].&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Levitt, and Martin W. Lewis. (1997). ''The Flight from Science and Reason'' (New York: New York Academy of Science.)&lt;/ref&gt; Attendees of the conference were critical of the [[Polemics|polemical]] approach of Gross and Levitt, yet agreed upon the intellectual inconsistency of how laymen, non-scientist, and social studies intellectuals dealt with science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://picpal.com/sciart.html Kramer, Jennifer. "Who's Flying – And In What Direction?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510055127/http://picpal.com/sciart.html |date=2006-05-10 }} Coverage of the NYAS Flight from Science and Reason conference.  Accessed 15 may 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science wars in ''Social Text''===
In 1996, ''[[Social Text]]'', a [[Duke University]] publication of [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] [[critical theory]], compiled a "Science Wars" issue containing brief articles by postmodernist academics in the [[social sciences]] and the [[humanities]], that emphasized the roles of society and politics in science. In the introduction to the issue, the ''Social Text'' editor, [[Andrew Ross (academic)|Andrew Ross]], said that the attack upon [[science studies]] was a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Reactionary|reaction]] to reduced funding for scientific research, characterizing the ''Flight from Science and Reason'' conference as an attempted "linking together a host of dangerous threats: [[scientific creationism]], [[New Age]] alternatives and cults, [[astrology]], [[Ufology|UFO-ism]], the radical science movement, postmodernism, and critical science studies, alongside the ready-made historical specters of [[Deutsche Physik|Aryan-Nazi science]] and the Soviet error of [[Lysenkoism]]" that "degenerated into name-calling".&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Andrew.  (1996). "Introduction" ''[[Social Text]] 46/47'', Vol. 14, Nos. 1 &amp; 2, pp. 1–13, esp. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Dorothy Nelkin]] characterised Gross and Levitt's vigorous response as a "call to arms in response to the failed marriage of Science and the State"&amp;mdash;in contrast to the scientists' historical tendency to avoid participating in perceived political threats, such as [[creation science]], the [[animal rights movement]], and anti-abortionists' attempts to curb fetal research.{{clarify|date=April 2013}} At the end of the Soviet–American [[Cold War]] (1945–91), [[military funding of science]] declined, while funding agencies demanded accountability, and research became directed by private interests. Nelkin suggested that postmodernist critics were "convenient scapegoats" who diverted attention from problems in science.&lt;ref&gt;Nelkin, Dorothy.  (1996). "The Science Wars: Responses to a Marriage Failed" ''Social Text'' 46/47, Vol. 14, Nos. 1 &amp; 2, pp. 93–100., p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1996, physicist [[Alan Sokal]] had submitted an article to ''Social Text'' titled "[[Sokal affair|Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity]]", which proposed that [[quantum gravity]] is a [[Linguistics|linguistic]] and [[social construct]] and that [[quantum physics]] supports postmodernist criticisms of scientific [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]]. After holding the article back from earlier issues due to Sokal's refusal to consider revisions, the staff published it in the "Science Wars" issue as a relevant contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Bruce and Ross, Andrew. [http://physics.nyu.edu/sokal/SocialText_reply_LF.pdf Editorial Response to the hoax, explaining Social Text's decision to publish]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the May 1996 issue of ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'', in the article "A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies", Sokal exposed his [[parody]]-article, "Transgressing the Boundaries" as an experiment testing the [[intellectual rigor]] of an [[academic journal]] that would "publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions".&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Alan. (1996).  "[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity]" ''[[Social Text]] 46/47'', Vol. 14, Nos. 1 &amp; 2, pp 217–252.&lt;/ref&gt; The matter became known as the "[[Sokal Affair]]" and brought greater public attention to the wider conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Alan. (1996).  "[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html A Physicist Experiments with Cultural Studies]," ''Lingua Franca'', May/June, pp 62–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Derrida]], a frequent target of "anti-relativist" criticism in the wake of Sokal's article, responded to the hoax in "Sokal and Bricmont Aren't Serious", first published in ''[[Le Monde]]''. He called Sokal's action sad (''triste'') for having overshadowed Sokal's mathematical work and ruined the chance to sort out controversies of scientific objectivity in a careful way. Derrida went on to fault him and co-author Jean Bricmont for what he considered an act of intellectual bad faith: they had accused him of scientific incompetence in the English edition of a follow-up book (an accusation several English reviewers noted), but deleted the accusation from the French edition and denied that it had ever existed. He concluded, as the title indicates, that Sokal was not serious in his approach, but had used the spectacle of a "quick practical joke" to displace the scholarship Derrida believed the public deserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Derrida |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Derrida |title=Paper Machine |origyear=1994 |year=2005 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford |page=70 |nopp=true |isbn=978-0-8047-4619-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued conflict===
In the first few years after the 'Science Wars' edition of ''Social Text'', the seriousness and volume of discussion increased significantly, much of it focused on reconciling the 'warring' camps of postmodernists and scientists.  One significant event was the 'Science and Its Critics' conference in early 1997; it brought together scientists and scholars who study science, and featured Alan Sokal and [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steve Fuller]] as keynote speakers.  The conference generated the final wave of substantial press coverage (in both news media and scientific journals), though by no means resolved the fundamental issues of [[social construction]] and [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] in science.&lt;ref&gt;Baringer, Philip S. (2001). "Introduction: 'the science wars'", from ''After the Science Wars'', eds. Keith M. Ashman and Philip S. Baringer. New York: Routlege, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other attempts have been made to reconcile the two camps. Mike Nauenberg, a physicist at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], organized a small conference in May 1997 that was attended by scientists and sociologists of science alike, among them [[Alan Sokal]], [[N. David Mermin]] and [[Harry Collins]]. In the same year, Collins organized the Southampton Peace Workshop, which again brought together a broad range of scientists and sociologists. The Peace Workshop gave rise to the idea of a book that intended to map out some of the arguments between the disputing parties. ''The One Culture?:  A Conversation about Science'', edited by chemist Jay A. Labinger and sociologist Harry Collins, was eventually published in 2001. The book, the title of which is a reference to [[C.P. Snow]]'s ''[[The Two Cultures]]'', contains contributions from authors such as Alan Sokal, Jean Bricmont, [[Steven Weinberg]] and [[Steven Shapin]].&lt;ref&gt;Labinger, Jay A. and [[Harry Collins]]. (2001). "Preface", in: ''The One Culture?:  A Conversation about Science'', eds. Labinger, Jay A and [[Harry Collins]]. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. ix–xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important publications related to the science wars include ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' by Sokal and [[Jean Bricmont]] (1998), ''The Social Construction of What?'' by [[Ian Hacking]] (1999) and ''Who Rules in Science'' by [[James Robert Brown]].

To [[John C. Baez]], the [[Bogdanov Affair]] in 2002&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;{{cite web | last = Monastersky | first = Richard | title = French TV Stars Rock the World of Theoretical Physics | work = [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date = November 2, 2002 | url = http://chronicle.com/free/2002/11/2002110501n.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-20 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080207103228/http://chronicle.com/free/2002/11/2002110501n.htm |archivedate = 2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; served as the bookend to the Sokal controversy: the review, acceptance, and publication of papers, later alleged to be nonsense, in peer-reviewed physics journals. [[Cornell University|Cornell]] physics professor [[Paul Ginsparg]], argued that the cases are not at all similar, and that the fact that some journals and scientific institutions have low standards is "hardly a revelation".&lt;ref name="ginsparg"&gt;[[Ginsparg, Paul]]. (2002, November 12). "'Is It Art?'  Is Not a Question for Physics".  ''[[New York Times]]'', section A, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The new editor in chief of the journal ''[[Annals of Physics]]'', who was appointed after the controversy along with a new editorial staff, had said that the standards of the journal had been poor leading up to the publication since the previous editor had become sick and died.&lt;ref name=Chronicle /&gt;

Interest in the science wars has waned considerably in recent years.  Though the events of the science wars are still occasionally mentioned in mainstream press, they have had little effect on either the scientific community or the community of critical theorists.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Both sides continue to maintain that the other does not understand their theories, or mistakes constructive criticisms and scholarly investigations for attacks. As [[Bruno Latour]] recently put it, "Scientists always stomp around meetings talking about 'bridging the two-culture gap', but when scores of people from outside the sciences begin to build just that bridge, they recoil in horror and want to impose the strangest of all gags on free speech since [[Socrates]]: only scientists should speak about science!"&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. (1999). ''[http://www.bruno-latour.fr/livres/vii_tdm.html  Pandora's Hope.  Essays on the Reality of Science Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904092247/http://www.bruno-latour.fr/livres/vii_tdm.html |date=2007-09-04 }}'', [[Harvard University Press]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Latour has suggested a re-evaluation of sociology's epistemology based on lessons learnt from the Science Wars: "...&amp;nbsp;scientists made us realize that there was not the slightest chance that the type of social forces we use as a cause could have objective facts as their effects".&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. (2005). ''Reassembling the Social.  An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory'', Oxford University Press, USA, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, more recently some of the leading critical theorists have recognized that their critiques have at times been counter-productive, and are providing intellectual ammunition for reactionary interests.

Writing about these developments in the context of [[global warming]], [[Bruno Latour]] noted that "dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives.  Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies? Is it enough to say that we did not really mean what we said?"&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. (2004). ''[http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/89-CRITICAL-INQUIRY-GB.pdf Why Has Critique Run Out of Steam? From Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern]'', ''[[Critical Inquiry]]'' 30, pp. 225–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kendrick Frazier]] notes that Latour is interested in helping to rebuild trust in science and that Latour has said that some of the authority of science needs to be regained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|title='Science Wars' Veteran Latour Now Wants to Help Rebuild Trust in Science |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Smokers' Rights Party''' was a registered [[political party]] in [[Australia]] from 2013 until September 2017.&lt;ref name="deregistered"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Deregistered_parties/files/2017-6278.pdf |title=Notice of deregistration Smokers Rights Party |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]] |date=5 September 2017 |accessdate=13 September 2017 |quote=Notice under s 137(4) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 On 5 September 2017, Stuart Oreo, acting Assistant Commissioner, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, deregistered the Smokers Rights Party under subsection 137(4) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. Reason: s 137(4) – failure to respond to notice under s 137 (1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was created in order to feed preferences to [[David Leyonhjelm]] of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Australia)|Liberal Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://indaily.com.au/news/2013/12/03/accusations-fly-in-micro-party-stoush/ "Accusations fly in micro-party stoush"], InDaily, 3 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crikey.com.au/2013/08/22/revealed-the-libertarian-rights-micro-party-links/ "Revealed: the libertarian Right's micro-party links"], Crikey, 22 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Turnbull_Government#Senate_reforms|abolition of group voting tickets]] in 2016, the Smokers' Rights Party was no longer able to act as a preference feeder, and published a statement recommending that supporters vote for Leyonhjelm in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smokersrights.org.au "How to vote to protect your rights in the 2016 election"], Smokers' Rights Party.&lt;/ref&gt; It was formally deregistered in September 2017.&lt;ref name="deregistered"/&gt;

The Smokers' Rights Party states that it does not receive funding from the tobacco industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smokersrights.org.au/links "Links"], Smokers' Rights Party.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the Liberal Democrats do, having received at least $35000 from [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]] in the 2013-2014 financial year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/02/thank-you-for-smoking-leyonhjelm-confirms-philip-morris-backing "'Thank you for smoking': Leyonhjelm confirms Philip Morris backing"], The Guardian, 2 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smokers Rights fielded only one candidate in the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]]. This was Joaquim De Lima as a candidate for the [[Division of Fowler]] in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="2016candidates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/election/candidates.htm |title=Candidates for the 2016 federal election |date=11 June 2016 |access-date=11 June 2016 |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Lima had previously run as a candidate for the [[Outdoor Recreation Party]] ([[Candidates of the New South Wales state election, 2011|NSW 2011 for Penrith]], [[Results for the Australian federal election, 2013 (Senate)#New South Wales|2013 Senate NSW]], [[Australian Senate special election in Western Australia, 2014|2014 senate WA]], [[Candidates of the New South Wales state election, 2015#Legislative Council|2015 NSW upper house]]),&lt;ref&gt;[https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/22111577/senate-candidates-dont-live-here/ "Senate candidates don't live here"], The West Australian, 22 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Liberal Democrats ([[Results of the Australian federal election, 2010 (New South Wales)#Greenway|Federal 2010 for Greenway]]).

[[South-South Cooperation|South-South cooperation]] is cooperation between two or more [[Developing country|developing countries]]. This article monitors recent developments in South-South cooperation in the field of science and technology.

== Role of regional economic communities ==
Regional economic communities have become a conduit for South–South cooperation in science, technology and innovation. Many of these economic communities have taken inspiration from the [[European Union]] model.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=A world in search of an effective growth strategy. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Soete|first=Luc|last2=Schneegans|first2=Susan|last3=Erocal|first3=Deniz|last4=Baskaran|first4=Angathevar|last5=Rasiah|first5=Rajah|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly, the long-term economic plans adopted by regional communities in the South are accompanied by a policy or strategy for science. For instance, the Policy on Science and Technology ([[ECOPOST]]) adopted in 2011 by the [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group|Economic Community of West African States’]] (ECOWAS) ‘is an integral part of Vision 2020’, the subregion’s development blueprint to 2020.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=West Africa. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Essegbey|first=George|last2=Diaby|first2=Nouhou|last3=Konte|first3=Almamy|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A world increasingly characterized by economic blocs ===
It has been argued that ‘the increasingly urgent requirement is for Africa to engage in a unified manner in a world that is increasingly characterized by economic blocs and large emerging economic powers’ and that ‘the most formidable obstacle of all to regional integration [in Africa] is probably the resistance of individual governments to relinquishing any national sovereignty’.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The President of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and former chair of the Caribbean Common Market (Caricom), Ralph Consalves, echoed this sentiment in a speech he gave in 2013. ‘It is evident… that our region would find it more difficult by far to address its immense current and prospective challenges, unless its governments and peoples embrace strongly a more mature, more profound regionalism’. 

The mood in sub-Saharan Africa is clearly towards greater regional integration. However, economic integration is being hampered by the similar structure of economies (minerals and agriculture), poor economic diversification and low levels of intraregional trade: just 12% of total African trade, compared to about 55% in Asia and 70% in Europe. Science is seen as a way of fostering regional economic integration, as it will enable countries to diversify their economies and develop intraregional trade. 

The continent is currently preparing the groundwork for the [[African Economic Community]], which is to be in place by 2028. To this end, regional communities are consolidating ties. The five members of the East African Community (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda), for instance, formed a common market in 2010. They plan to establish a common currency by 2023 and are developing a Common Higher Education Area that has been inspired by the European Union model. In 2015, the East African Community signed a Tripartite Free Trade Agreement with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa grouping 20 states and the SADC grouping 15 states.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The [[Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation]] (BSEC) was founded in 1992, shortly after the distantegration of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, in order to develop prosperity and security in the region. One of its goals is to deepen ties with the [[European Commission]] in Brussels. The Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs is the BSEC's central decision-making body. There is also a Parliamentary Assembly modelled on the [[Council of Europe]] and a Permanent International Secretariat, based in Istanbul. The BSEC has a Business Council made up of experts and representatives of Chambers of Commerce from the member states and a [[Black Sea Trade and Development Bank]] which receives support from the [[European Investment Bank]] and the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Countries in the Black Sea basin. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030.|last=Eröcal|first=Deniz|last2=Yegorov|first2=Igor|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Union of South American Nations]] (UNASUR).only became a legal entity in 2011. Like others before it, UNASUR is modelled on the European Union and, thus, embraces the free movement of goods, services, capital and people among its 12 members. UNASUR plans to establish a common parliament and currency. Governments have also been discussing the idea of standardizing university degrees in member countries. Rather than creating other new institutions, UNASUR plans to rely on existing trade blocs like the Common Market for the South ([[Mercosur]]) and the [[Andean Community]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Latin America. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Lemarchand|first=Guillermo A.|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some voices from within the Gulf have suggested transforming the Gulf Cooperation Council into a regional socio-economic and political bloc that would also be modelled on the European Union.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Scientific integration part of regional economic integration ===
The [[East African Community|East African Community’s]] Common Market Protocol (2010) makes provision for market-led research, the promotion of industrial research and the transfer, acquisition, adaptation and development of modern technology. States are encouraged to collaborate with the [[East African Science and Technology Commission]] and to establish a research and technological development fund for the purpose of implementing the provisions in the protocol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=East and Central Africa.

The Strategic Plan for the Caribbean Community 2015–2019 proposes reinforcing regional integration by adopting a common foreign policy and embracing research and innovation. To improve co-ordination among the four existing regional organizations (Caribbean Science Foundation, Cariscience, Caribbean Academy of Sciences and Caribbean Council for Science and Technology), the Prime Minister of Grenada, Keith Mitchell, who is also responsible for science and technology within Caricom, set up the Caricom Science, Technology and Innovation Committee in 2014.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Caricom. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Ramkissoon|first=Harold|last2=Kahwa|first2=Ishenkumba A.|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the focus of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|Association of South East Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) has always been on the creation of a single market along the lines of the European model, ‘leaders have long acknowledged that successful economic integration will hinge on how well member states manage to assimilate science and technology’. When ASEAN’s Vision 2020 was adopted in 1997, its stated goal ‘was for the region to be technologically competitive by 2020’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Malaysia. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Rasiah|first=Rajah|last2=Chandran, V.G.R.|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|year=|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=|pages=689|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASEAN’s Plan of Action on Science, Technology and Innovation 2016–2020 ‘aims to strengthen scientific capacity in member states by fostering exchanges among researchers both within the region and beyond’. The new [[ASEAN Economic Community]] is expected to spur scientific cooperation among member countries, while enhancing the role of the ASEAN University Network, which already counts 30 members.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Tracking trends in innovation and mobility. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Korku Avenyo|first=Elvis et al.|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=|pages=76|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Southeast Asia and Oceania.

The [[Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation]] (BSEC) has adopted three Action Plans on Cooperation in Science and Technology (2005-2009, 2010-2014 and 2014-2018). The second Action Plan was funded on a project basis, since the plan had no dedicated budget. Two key projects were funded by the European Union in 2008 and 2009, namely the Scientific and Technological International Cooperation Network for Eastern European and Central Asian Countries (IncoNet EECA) and the Networking on Science and Technology in the Black Sea Region project (BS-ERA-Net).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Not all the more established regional economic communities have enjoyed the same level of success. For instance, ‘since its inception in 1985, the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) has failed to emulate the success of [ASEAN] in fostering regional integration in trade and other areas, including in science, technology and innovation... South Asia remains one of the world’s least economically integrated regions, with intraregional trade accounting for merely 5% of total trade’.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The [[South Asian University]], which opened its doors in 2010 with the intention of becoming a centre of excellence, is the exception which confirms the rule. The university is hosted by India but all SAARC members share the operational costs in mutually agreed proportions. Admission is governed by a quota system, with students paying heavily subsidized tuition fees. In 2013, the university received 4 133 applications from all eight SAARC countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Pakistan), double the number in 2012. There were 500 applications alone for the 10 places on offer for the doctoral programme in biotechnology.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=South Asia. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Nakandala|first=Dilupa|last2=Malik|first2=Ammar A.|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other regions, some strategies have encountered hurdles that may affect implementation. This is the case of the Protocol on Science, Technology and Innovation, for instance; it was adopted by all 15 members of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) in 2008 but, by 2015, had only been ratified by four: Botswana, Mauritius, Mozambique and South Africa. The protocol was able to enter into force in June 2017, once two-thirds of member states had ratified it. Although the South African Department of Science and Technology described the protocol, in a 2011 briefing, as ‘an essential first step towards regional integration, with steady growth in self-financed bilateral cooperation’, it also found the regional desk for science, technology and innovation to be ‘under-resourced and mostly ineffectual’, making ‘member states reluctant to support it’.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Southern Africa. In UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Kraemer-Mbula|first=Erika|last2=Scerri|first2=Mario|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BSEC's Third Action Plan on Science and Technology 2014-2018 acknowledges that considerable effort has been devoted to setting up a Black Sea Research Programme involving both BSEC and European Union members but also that, ‘in a period of scarce public funding, the research projects the Project Development Fund could support will decrease and, as a result, its impact will be limited. Additional efforts are needed to find a solution for the replenishment of the Project Development Fund’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.bsec-organization.org/aoc/science/Pages/Annex%20IV%20-%20Third%20Action%20Plan.pdf|title=Third Action Plan on Science and Technology, 2014-2018|last=Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation|first=|publisher=Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current roadmap for the Arab region is the Arab Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation. It was endorsed in 2014 by the Council of Ministers of Higher Education and Scientific Research in the Arab World. The Strategy urges countries to engage in greater international cooperation in 14 scientific disciplines and strategic economic sectors, including nuclear energy, space sciences and convergent technologies such as bio-informatics and nanobiotechnology. ‘The Strategy nevertheless eludes some core issues, including the delicate question of who will foot the hefty bill of implementing' it.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Arab States. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Zoubi|first=Moneef|last2=Mohamed-Nour|first2=Samia|last3=El-Kharraz|first3=Jauad|last4=Hassan|first4=Nazar|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3100129-1|location=Paris|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab States in Asia experienced the fastest growth in international scientific collaboration (+199%) of any region between 2008 and 2014. Five developing Arab economies count one or more developing countries among their top five partners: Iraq (Malaysia and China), Libya (India), Oman (India), Palestine (Egypt and Malaysia) and Yemen (Malaysia and Egypt).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/international_scientific_collaboration_has_become_a_must_sa/][https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/tab_usr15_s10_publications_collaboration_en.pdf]

The [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] has encouraged its members to diversify their economies for the past 30 years, during which time Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have all developed non-oil sectors. The United Arab Emirates has been advocating the creation of a pan-Arab space agency for years. Together with the Korean company Satrec Initiative, the [[Emirates Institution for Advanced Science and Technology]] placed its first Earth-observation satellite in orbit in 2009, followed by a second in 2013 and, if all goes according to plan, a third in 2017.

== Industrial development a key focus of South–South cooperation ==

=== Multilateral scientific cooperation ===
Countries of the South are collaborating in fields with industrial potential. One interesting example within the Mercosur space (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela) is the Biotech project. It has been designed to take better advantage of existing research skills to foster competitiveness in productive sectors. The second phase, Biotech II, addresses regional projects in biotechnological innovation linked to human health (diagnosis, prevention and the development of vaccines against infectious diseases, cancer, type 2 diabetes and autoimmune diseases) and biomass production (traditional and non-traditional crops), biofuel elaboration processes and evaluation of its by-products. New criteria have been incorporated to respond to demand from participating consortia for a greater return on investment and the participation of more partners, such as from Europe.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Bio-industry is also the focus of the Innovative Biotechnologies Programme (2011–2015), which was established by the [[Eurasian Economic Community]] (since superseded by the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] in January 2015). Within this programme, prizes were awarded at an annual bio-industry exhibition and conference. In 2012, 86 Russian organizations participated, plus three from Belarus, one from Kazakhstan and three from Tajikistan, as well as two scientific research groups from Germany.It is noteworthy that an oil-rent economy like Kazakhstan participated in this programme. For Vladimir Debabov, Scientific Director of the Genetika State Research Institute for Genetics and the Selection of Industrial Micro-organisms in the Russian Federation, ‘in the world today, there is a strong tendency to switch from petrochemicals to renewable biological sources. Biotechnology is developing two to three times faster than chemicals.’&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Central Asia.

In 2013, the Russian, Belarusian and Kazakh governments pooled their resources to create a Centre for Innovative Technologies. Selected projects sponsored by the centre are entitled to funding of US$3–90 million each and are implemented within a public–private partnership. The first few projects approved focused on supercomputers, space technologies, medicine, petroleum recycling, nanotechnologies and the ecological use of natural resources. Once these initial projects have spawned viable commercial products, it is planned to reinvest the profits in new projects.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Nanotechnology is a focus of South–South cooperation led by Iran. In 2008, Iran’s Nanotechnology Initiative Council established an Econano network to promote the scientific and industrial development of nanotechnology among fellow members of the Economic Cooperation Organization, namely Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Iran.

=== Bilateral scientific cooperation ===
Bilateral scientific cooperation, too, can often have an industrial focus. India and Sri Lanka, for instance, set up a Joint Committee on Science and Technology in 2011, along with an Indo-Sri Lankan Joint Research Programme. The first call for proposals in 2012 covered research topics in food science and technology; applications of nuclear technology; oceanography and Earth science; biotechnology and pharmaceuticals; materials science; medical research, including traditional medical systems; and spatial data infrastructure and space science. Two bilateral workshops were held in 2013 to discuss potential research collaboration on transdermal drug delivery systems and clinical, diagnostic, chemotherapeutic and entomological aspects of Leishmaniasis, a disease prevalent in both India and Sri Lanka that is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected sandflies.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The [[BRICS]] (Brazil, Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa) tend to engage in bilateral collaboration on scientific projects. There is ‘dynamic bilateral collaboration’ between China and the Russian Federation, for instance. This cooperation stems from the Treaty on Good Neighbourliness, Friendship and Co-operation signed by the two countries in 2001, which has given rise to regular four-year plans for its implementation. Dozens of joint large-scale projects are being carried out. They concern the construction of the first super-high-voltage electricity transmission line in China; the development of an experimental fast neutron reactor; geological prospecting in the Russian Federation and China; and joint research in optics, metal processing, hydraulics, aerodynamics and solid fuel cells. Other priority areas for co-operation include industrial and medical lasers, computer technology, energy, the environment and chemistry, geochemistry, catalytic processes and new materials.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Russian Federation. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Gokhberg|first=Leonid|last2=Kuznetsova|first2=Tatiana|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian Federation and China are also cooperating in the field of satellite navigation, through a project involving Glonass (the Russian equivalent of GPS) and Beidou (the regional Chinese satellite navigation system). They have also embarked on a joint study of the planets of our Solar System. A resident company of the Skolkovo Innovation Centre, Optogard Nanotech (Russian) signed a long-term deal with the Chinese Shandong Trustpipe Industry Group in 2014 to promote Russian technologies in China. In 2014, Moscow State University, the Russian Venture Company and the China Construction Investment Corporation (Chzhoda) also signed an agreement to upscale cooperation in developing technologies for ‘smart homes’ and ‘smart’ cities’.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The [[UNESCO Science Report]] observes that ‘we are seeing a shift in Russo–Chinese collaboration from knowledge and project exchanges to joint work'. Since 2003, joint technoparks have been operating in the Chinese cities of Harbin, Changchun and Yantai, among others. Within these technoparks, there are plans to manufacture civilian and military aircraft, space vehicles, gas turbines and other large equipment using cutting-edge innovation, as well as to mass-produce Russian technologies developed by the Siberian Branch of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. One new priority theme for high-tech co-operation concerns the joint development of a new long-range civil aircraft.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Cooperation in space science ==
The China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellites (CBERS) programme embraces a family of remote-sensing satellites built jointly by Brazil and China which provide coverage of the world´s land areas. CBERS-1 functioned from October 1999 to July 2003, CBERS-2 from October 2003 to June 2008 and CBERS-2B from September 2007 to May 2010. CBERS-3 was launched in 2011 and CBERS-4 in 2014. CBERS-3 and CBERS-4 are each equipped with four cameras with bands in visible, near-infrared, middle and thermal infrared Brazil and China share the responsibility for, and cost of, building the satellites. In Brazil, the [[National Institute for Space Research]] (INPE) designs half of the subsystems and contracts them to the Brazilian space industry. As of 2010, the Brazilian participation in the programme amounted to a total cost of about US$ 500 million, with 60% of investment taking the form of industrial contracts. Data obtained from the CBERS satellites are released within a free and open data policy. From 2004 to 2010, more than 1.5 million images were delivered to users in Brazil, Latin America and China. These images have applications in forestry and agriculture assessment, urban management and geological mapping. Brazil uses the images to survey deforestation in Amazonia and to assess land use associated with cash crops such as sugarcane and soybeans and with large-scale cattle ranching. China and Brazil have agreed on a joint strategy for facilitating international access to remotesensing data in Africa. Since 2012, African ground stations in South Africa, the Canary Islands, Egypt, and Gabonhave been receiving CBERS data which they are entitled to share. The CBERS programme thus enables Brazil and China to contribute to global environmental policy-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=UNESCO Science Report: the Current Status of Science around the World|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2010|isbn=978-92-3-104132-7|location=Paris|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The joint Argentinian–Brazilian SABIA-MAR Earth observation satellite mission will be studying ocean ecosystems, carbon cycling, marine habitats mapping, coasts and coastal hazards, inland waters and fisheries. Also under development in 2015 was the new SARE series designed to expand the active remote observation of Earth through the use of microwave and optical radars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==  Development of African networks of centres of excellence ==
A central strategy of Africa’s Science and Technology Consolidated Plan of Action (CPA) for 2005–2014 was to establish networks of centres of excellence across the continent. A decade on, these centres are one of the plan’s success stories, according to an expert review of the CPA.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Review of Africa's Science and Technology Consolidated Plan of Action, 2005-2014. Final draft|last=AMCOST|first=|publisher=Study by expert panel commissioned by African Ministerial Conference on Science and Technology|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these networks focus on biosciences. Four networks of centres of excellence have been established in Egypt, Kenya, Senegal and South Africa within the African Biosciences Initiative, whereby participating institutes offer their facilities for subregional use.Two complementary networks based in Kenya and Burkina Faso focus on improving agricultural techniques and developing agro-processing, in the case of Bio-Innovate, and on helping regulators deal with safety issues related to the introduction and development of genetically modified organisms, in the case of the African Biosafety Network of Expertise.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A network of five African Institutes of Mathematical Sciences has also taken root. The first one opened in South Africa in 2003 and the remainder in Senegal, Ghana, Cameroon and Tanzania between 2012 and 2014. Each offers postgraduate education, research and outreach. The plan now is for a vast network of 15 such centres across Africa, within a scheme known as the Next Einstein Initiative. The Government of Canada made a US$20 million investment in the project in 2010 and numerous governments in Africa and Europe have followed suit.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

These networks have an Achilles tendon, though, since many are reliant on donor funding for their survival. The biosciences hub in Kenya for East and Central Africa, for instance, relies on support from the Australian, Canadian and Swedish governments, as well as from partners such as the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]. A 2014 evaluation concluded that the hub remained ‘financially vulnerable’.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

‘With hardly any African governments having raised domestic research spending to the target level of 1% of GDP, more than 90% of funding mobilized for implementation of the CPA came from bilateral and multilateral donors’, concluded the expert review of the CPA. The review also noted that ‘the failure to set up the African Science and Technology Fund was one of the landmark and visible weaknesses in implementation of the CPA’. Although the continent’s roadmap for the next decade, the Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy for Africa to 2024 (STISA-2024), considers it ‘urgent to set up such a fund’, it identifies no specific funding mechanism – even though STISA ‘places science, technology and innovation at the epicentre of Africa’s socio-economic development and growth’.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.hsrc.ac.za/uploads/pageContent/5481/Science,%20Technology%20and%20Innovation%20Strategy%20for%20Africa%20-%20Document.pdf|title=Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy for Africa to 2024|last=African Union/NEPAD|first=|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[West African Economic and Monetary Union]] (WAEMU) designated 14 centres of excellence in member countries, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger and Togo. This label entitles these institutions to financial support from WAEMU for a two-year period. ECOWAS intends to establish several centres of excellence of its own on a competitive basis, within its own Policy on Science and Technology (ECOPOST).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== South Africa: soft power through science ==
South Africa is a regional powerhouse, since it alone generates about one-quarter of African GDP. In 2012, South Africa invested in more new projects across the continent than any other country in the world.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Through the [[Department of Science and Technology (South Africa)|Department of Science and Technology]], South Africa has entered into 21 formal bilateral agreements with other African countries in science and technology since 1997, most recently with Ethiopia and Sudan in 2014. Within three-year joint implementation plans which define spheres of common interest, cooperation tends to take the form of joint research calls and capacity-building through information- and infrastructure-sharing, workshops, student exchanges, development assistance and so on.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Space science and technology are a focus of bilateral cooperation for 10 out of the 21 countries. In 2012, South Africa and Australia won a bid to build the world’s largest radio telescope, the [[Square Kilometre Array]] (SKA), at a cost of €1.5 billion. South Africa is working with eight African partners in this area, six of them from within the SADC: Botswana, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia. The other two are Ghana and Kenya.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Through the African SKA Human Capital Development Programme, South Africa has also been co-operating with other SADC countries in skills training since 2005. In 2012, the programme awarded about 400 grants for studies in astronomy and engineering from undergraduate to postdoctoral levels, while also investing in training programmes for technicians. Courses in astronomy are being taught in Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius and Mozambique.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

This work is complemented by an agreement signed in 2009 between Algeria, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa for the construction of three low-Earth orbiting satellites within the [[African Resource Management Constellation]] (ARMC). South Africa will build at least one out of the three, construction of which (ZA-ARMC1) began in 2013. This cooperation should develop Africa’s technological and human capacities in Earth observation, for use in urban planning, land cover mapping, disaster prediction and monitoring, water management, oil and gas pipeline monitoring and so on.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== International centres fostering South–South cooperation ==
Increasingly, countries of the South are fostering cooperation in science and technology through regional or international centres. Many of these centres function under the auspices of United Nations agencies. The following are some examples.

The International Science, Technology and Innovation Centre for South–South Cooperation (ISTIC) was set up in Malaysia in 2008 under the auspices of UNESCO.  In 2014, Cariscience ‘pushed back its boundaries’ by running a training workshop in Tobago on Technopreneurship for the Caribbean, in partnership with ISTIC.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Since 2011, China has set up two centres which function under the auspices of UNESCO. The first is the Regional Training and Research Centre on Ocean Dynamics and Climate, which has been training young scientists from Asian developing countries, in particular, since 2011, at no cost to the beneficiary. The second is the International Research and Training Centre for Science and Technology Strategy, inaugurated in Beijing in September 2012. It designs and conducts international co-operative research and training programmes in such areas as indicators and statistical analysis, technology foresight and roadmapping, financing policies for innovation, the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and strategies for addressing climate change and sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=China.

India hosts the Regional Centre for Biotechnology, the first of its kind in South Asia. Established under the auspices of UNESCO in 2006, the centre is part of the Biotech Science Cluster being built in Faridabad by the Department of Biotechnology. It offers specialized training and research programmes in new opportunity areas, such as cell and tissue engineering, nanobiotechnology and bioinformatics, with an emphasis on interdisciplinarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=India.

In 2012, an International Centre for Biotechnology was established under the auspices of UNESCO at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka. The institute provides high-level training (including at subregional level), education and research, particularly in areas related to food security, conservation of harvested crops, gene banking and tropical diseases.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[West Africa Institute]] is the fruit of a public–private partnership involving ECOWAS, the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), UNESCO, the pan-African Ecobank and the Government of Cabo Verde. This think tank was established in Praia (Cabo Verde) in 2010, to provide the missing link between policy and research in the regional integration process. The institute is a service provider, conducting research for regional and national public institutions, the private sector, civil society and the media.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Iran hosts several international research centres, including the following, which function under the auspices of United Nations bodies: the Regional Centre for Science Park and Technology Incubator Development (UNESCO, est. 2010), the International Centre on Nanotechnology (UNIDO, est. 2012) and the Regional Educational and Research Centre for Oceanography for Western Asia (UNESCO, est. 2014).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Iran is one of nine members of a new centre which uses [[Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East|Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East (SESAME)]]. Most of the other eight members are developing economies: Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority and Turkey.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

SESAME’s mission is to provide a world-class research facility for the region, while fostering international scientific cooperation. SESAME was established under the auspices of UNESCO before becoming a fully independent intergovernmental organization in its own right. Construction of the centre began in Jordan in 2003. Now fully operational, the centre is being officially inaugurated in May 2017.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/about-us/single-view/news/pioneering_sesame_light_source_circulates_first_beam/]

Synchrotrons have become an indispensable tool for modern science. They work by accelerating electrons around a circular tube at high speed, during which time excess energy is given off in the form of light. The light source acts like a super X-ray machine and can be used by researchers to study everything from viruses and new drugs to novel materials and archaeological artefacts. There are some 50 such storage-ring based synchrotrons in use around the world. Although the majority are found in high-income countries, Brazil and China also have them.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

A '''spa''' is a location where mineral-rich [[spring (hydrology)|spring water]] (and sometimes [[seawater]]) is used to give [[medicinal]] baths. [[Spa town]]s or [[spa resort]]s (including [[hot spring]]s resorts) typically offer various health treatments, which are also known as [[balneotherapy]]. The belief in the curative powers of [[mineral water]]s goes back to prehistoric times. Such practices have been popular worldwide, but are especially widespread in Europe and Japan. [[Day spa]]s are also quite popular, and offer various personal care treatments.

==Origins of the term==
{{See also|Mineral spa}}
The term is derived from the name of the town of [[Spa, Belgium]], whose name is known back from Roman times, when the location was called ''Aquae Spadanae'',&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, George Rosen, Yale University Dept. of the History of Science and Medicine, Project Muse, H. Schuman, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes incorrectly connected to the [[Latin]] word ''spargere'' meaning to scatter, sprinkle or moisten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ard.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/61/3/273#R2| title=A brief history of spa therapy| publisher=| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208052840/http://ard.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/61/3/273#R2| archivedate=8 February 2006| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[medieval]] times, illnesses caused by iron deficiency were treated by drinking [[chalybeate]] (iron-bearing) spring water (in 1326, the iron-master Collin le Loup claimed a cure,&lt;ref name=medhyd&gt;Medical Hydrology, Sidney Licht, Sidney Herman Licht, Herman L. Kamenetz, E. Licht, 1963 [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;id=X_FsAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=espa+spa+Belgium+date%3A1900-1980&amp;q=espa&amp;pgis=1#search_anchor Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; when the spring was called ''Espa'', a [[Walloon language|Walloon]] word for "fountain"&lt;ref name=medhyd/&gt;).

In 16th-century [[England]], the old [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ideas of medicinal bathing were revived at towns like [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] (''not'' the source of the word [[wikt:bath|bath]]), and in 1596 [[William Slingsby]] who had been to the Belgian town (which he called ''Spaw'') discovered a [[chalybeate]] spring in [[Yorkshire]]. He built an enclosed well at what became known as [[Harrogate]], the first resort in England for drinking medicinal waters, then in 1596 Dr [[Timothy Bright]] after discovering a second well called the resort ''The English Spaw'', beginning the use of the word ''Spa'' as a generic description.

It is commonly claimed, in a commercial context, that the word is an [[acronym]] of various Latin phrases, such as ''salus per aquam'' or ''sanitas per aquam'', meaning "health through water".&lt;ref name=leisurerec&gt;For instance, 'Leisure and Recreation Management', George Torkildsen, Routledge, 2005, {{ISBN|0-415-30995-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=UZxwctypZ0sC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq="Sanitas+Per+Aqua" Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; This is very unlikely: the derivation does not appear before the early 21st century and is probably a [[backronym]] as there is no evidence of acronyms passing into the language before the 20th century;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-gol1.htm|title=World Wide Words: Golf|work=World Wide Words|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909144154/http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-gol1.htm|archivedate=9 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor does it match the known Roman name for the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faktoider.nu/spa_eng.html|title=Hexmaster's Factoids: Spa|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724190819/http://www.faktoider.nu/spa_eng.html|archivedate=24 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the background is the tower of the abbey.|thumb|Ancient [[Roman Baths (Bath)|Roman Baths]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath, England]]]]

Spa therapies have existed since the classical times when taking bath with water was considered as a popular means to treat illnesses.&lt;ref name="A brief history of spa therapy"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A brief history of spa therapy|journal=Ann Rheum Dis |year=2002|volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=273–275|pmid=11830439 |pmc=1754027 |author1=Van Tubergen |first1=A |last2=Van Der Linden |first2=S |doi=10.1136/ard.61.3.273}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of traveling to hot or cold springs in hopes of effecting a cure of some ailment dates back to prehistoric times. Archaeological investigations near hot springs in France and Czech Republic revealed [[Bronze Age]] weapons and offerings. In Great Britain, ancient legend credited early Celtic kings with the discovery of the hot springs in Bath, England.

Many people around the world believed that bathing in a particular spring, well, or river resulted in physical and spiritual purification. Forms of ritual purification existed among the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Babylonians]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Today, ritual purification through water can be found in the religious ceremonies of [[Jew]]s, [[Muslim]]s, [[Christian]]s, [[Buddhist]]s, and [[Hindu]]s. These ceremonies reflect the ancient belief in the healing and purifying properties of water. Complex bathing rituals were also practiced in ancient Egypt, in prehistoric cities of the [[Indus Valley]], and in [[Aegean civilization]]s.  Most often these ancient people did little building construction around the water, and what they did construct was very temporary in nature.&lt;ref name="Paige1987"&gt;{{cite book|last = Paige|first = John C|authorlink = |author2 = Laura Woulliere Harrison|title = Out of the Vapors: A Social and Architectural History of Bathhouse Row, Hot Springs National Park|publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior|year = 1987|location = |pages = |url = http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/hosp/bathhouse_row.pdf|doi = |id = |isbn = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090225013243/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/hosp/bathhouse_row.pdf|archivedate = 25 February 2009|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bathing in Greek and Roman times===

Some of the earliest descriptions of western bathing practices came from Greece. The Greeks began bathing regimens that formed the foundation for modern spa procedures. These Aegean people utilized small bathtubs, wash basins, and foot baths for personal cleanliness. The earliest such findings are the baths in the palace complex at [[Knossos]], [[Crete]], and the luxurious [[alabaster]] bathtubs excavated in [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]], [[Santorini]]; both date from the mid-2nd millennium BC. They established public baths and showers within their [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] complexes for relaxation and personal hygiene. [[Greek mythology]] specified that certain natural springs or [[tidal pool]]s were blessed by the gods to cure disease. Around these sacred pools, Greeks established bathing facilities for those desiring healing. Supplicants left offerings to the gods for healing at these sites and bathed themselves in hopes of a cure. The [[Sparta]]ns developed a primitive vapor bath. At [[Serangeum]], an early Greek ''balneum'' (bathhouse, loosely translated), bathing chambers were cut into the hillside from which the hot springs issued. A series of niches cut into the rock above the chambers held bathers' clothing. One of the bathing chambers had a decorative mosaic floor depicting a driver and chariot pulled by four horses, a woman followed by two dogs, and a dolphin below. Thus, the early Greeks used the natural features, but expanded them and added their own amenities, such as decorations and shelves. During later Greek civilization, bathhouses were often built in conjunction with athletic fields.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

{{Main article|Ancient Roman bathing}}
The Romans emulated many of the Greek bathing practices. Romans surpassed the Greeks in the size and complexity of their baths. This came about by many factors: the larger size and population of Roman cities, the availability of running water following the building of [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], and the invention of [[cement]], which made building large edifices easier, safer, and cheaper. As in Greece, the Roman bath became a focal center for social and recreational activity. As the [[Roman Empire]] expanded, the idea of the public bath spread to all parts of the Mediterranean and into regions of Europe and North Africa. With the construction of the [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], the Romans had enough water not only for domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses, but also for their leisurely pursuits. The aqueducts provided water that was later heated for use in the baths. Today, the extent of the Roman bath is revealed at ruins and in archaeological excavations in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

The Romans also developed baths in their colonies, taking advantage of the natural hot springs occurring in Europe to construct baths at [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]] and [[Vichy, France|Vichy]] in France, [[Bath, England|Bath]] and [[Buxton]] in England, [[Aachen, Germany|Aachen]] and [[Wiesbaden]] in Germany, [[Baden, Austria]], and [[Aquincum]] in Hungary, among other locations. These baths became centers for recreational and social activities in Roman communities. Libraries, lecture halls, gymnasiums, and formal gardens became part of some bath complexes. In addition, the Romans used the hot thermal waters to relieve their suffering from [[rheumatism]], [[arthritis]], and overindulgence in food and drink. The decline of the Roman Empire in the west, beginning in AD 337 after the death of [[Emperor Constantine]], resulted in Roman legions abandoning their outlying provinces and leaving the baths to be taken over by the local population or destroyed.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

Thus, the Romans elevated bathing to a fine art, and their bathhouses physically reflected these advancements. The Roman bath, for instance, included a far more complex ritual than a simple immersion or sweating procedure. The various parts of the bathing ritual — undressing, bathing, sweating, receiving a massage, and resting — required separated rooms which the Romans built to accommodate those functions. The segregation of the sexes and the additions of diversions not directly related to bathing also had direct impacts on the shape and form of bathhouses. The elaborate Roman bathing ritual and its resultant architecture served as precedents for later European and American bathing facilities. Formal garden spaces and opulent architectural arrangement equal to those of the Romans reappeared in Europe by the end of the 18th century. Major American spas followed suit a century later.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

===Bathing in medieval times===
[[File:Aachen Kaiserbad 1682.jpg|thumb|300px|Hot springs at [[Aachen]], Germany, 1682]]
With the decline of the Roman Empire, the public baths often became places of licentious behavior, and such use was responsible for the spread rather than the cure of diseases. A general belief developed among the European populace was that frequent bathing promoted disease and sickness. Medieval church authorities encouraged this belief and made every effort to close down public baths. Ecclesiastical officials believed that public bathing created an environment open to immorality and disease. [[Roman Catholic Church]] officials even banned public bathing in an unsuccessful effort to halt [[syphilis]] epidemics from sweeping Europe. Overall, this period represented a time of decline for public bathing.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

People continued to seek out a few select hot and cold springs, believed to be holy wells, to cure various ailments. In an age of religious fervor, the benefits of the water were attributed to God or one of the saints. In 1326, Collin le Loup, an iron-master from [[Liège, Belgium]], discovered the [[chalybeate]] springs of [[Spa, Belgium]]. Around these springs, a famous health resort eventually grew and the term "spa" came to refer to any health resort located near natural springs. During this period, individual springs became associated with the specific ailment that they could allegedly benefit.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

Bathing procedures during this period varied greatly. By the 16th century, physicians at [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad, Bohemia]], prescribed that the mineral water be taken internally as well as externally. Patients periodically bathed in warm water for up to 10 or 11 hours while drinking glasses of mineral water. The first bath session occurred in the morning, the second in the afternoon. This treatment lasted several days until skin pustules formed and broke resulting in the draining of "poisons" considered to be the source of the disease. Then followed another series of shorter, hotter baths to wash the infection away and close the eruptions.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

In the English coastal town of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] in 1626, a Mrs. Elizabeth Farrow discovered a stream of acidic water running from one of the cliffs to the south of the town. This was deemed to have beneficial health properties and gave birth to [[The Spa, Scarborough|Scarborough Spa]]. Dr Wittie's book about the spa waters published in 1660 attracted a flood of visitors to the town. Sea bathing was added to the cure, and Scarborough became Britain's first seaside resort. The first rolling bathing machines for bathers are recorded on the sands in 1735.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scarboroughspa.co.uk/centuries |title=A Brief History of Scarborough Spa |accessdate=16 June 2008 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bathing in the 18th century===
In the 17th century, most upper-class Europeans washed their clothes with water often and washed only their faces (with linen), feeling that bathing the entire body was a lower-class activity; but the upper-class slowly began changing their attitudes toward bathing as a way to restore health later in that century. The wealthy flocked to health resorts to drink and bathe in the waters. In 1702, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]], traveled to Bath, the former Roman development, to bathe. A short time later, [[Richard (Beau) Nash]] came to Bath. By the force of his personality, Nash became the arbiter of good taste and manners in England. He along with financier [[Ralph Allen]] and architect [[John Wood, the Elder|John Wood]] transformed Bath from a country spa into the social capital of England. Bath set the tone for other spas in Europe to follow. Ostensibly, the wealthy and famous arrived there on a seasonal basis to bathe in and drink the water; however, they also came to display their opulence. Social activities at Bath included dances, concerts, playing cards, lectures, and promenading down the street.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

A typical day at Bath might be an early morning communal bath followed by a private breakfast party. Afterwards, one either drank water at the Pump Room (a building constructed over the thermal water source) or attended a fashion show. Physicians encouraged health resort patrons to bathe in and drink the waters with equal vigor. The next several hours of the day could be spent in shopping, visiting the lending library, attending concerts, or stopping at one of the coffeehouses. At 4:00 pm, the rich and famous dressed up in their finery and promenaded down the streets. Next came dinner, more promenading, and an evening of dancing or gambling.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

Similar activities occurred in health resorts throughout Europe. The spas became stages on which Europeans paraded with great pageantry. These resorts became infamous as places full of gossip and scandals. The various social and economic classes selected specific seasons during the year's course, staying from one to several months, to vacation at each resort. One season aristocrats occupied the resorts; at other times, prosperous farmers or retired military men took the baths. The wealthy and the criminals that preyed on them moved from one spa to the next as the fashionable season for that resort changed.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

During the 18th century, a revival in the medical uses of spring water was promoted by Enlightened physicians across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Sparkling Nectar of Spas: The Medical and Commercial Relevance of Mineral Water|journal=Ursula Klein and E.

For example, in Karlsbad the accepted method of drinking the mineral water required sending large barrels to individual boardinghouses where the patients drank physician-prescribed dosages in the solitude of their rooms. Dr. David Beecher in 1777 recommended that the patients come to the fountainhead for the water and that each patient should first do some prescribed exercises. This innovation increased the medicinal benefits obtained and gradually physical activity became part of the European bathing regimen. In 1797, in England, Dr. James Currie published ''The Effects of Water, Cold and Warm, as a Remedy in Fever and other Diseases''. As shown by M D Eddy, this book, along with numerous local pamphlets on composition of spa water, stimulated additional interest in water cures and advocated the external and internal use of water as part of the curing process.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|title=The Sparkling Nectar of Spas|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Vigier%27s_baths,_Year_V_-_1797.jpg|thumb|left|Poster for [[Pierre Vigier|Vigier]] Baths on the banks of the [[Seine]] river, in Paris (1797)]]

===Bathing in the 19th and 20th centuries===

In the 19th century, bathing became a more accepted practice as physicians realized some of the benefits that cleanliness could provide. A [[cholera]] epidemic in [[Liverpool, England]] in 1842 resulted in a sanitation renaissance, facilitated by the overlapping [[Captain R. T. Claridge#Hydropathy and related movements|hydropathy and sanitation movements]], and the implementation of a series of statutes known collectively as "The Baths and Wash-houses Acts 1846 to 1896".&lt;ref name="Baths&amp;WashhousesActs"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Baths#Action of Baths on the Human System |display=Baths § Action of Baths on the Human System |volume=3 |page=518}}

Also in 1842, a house in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], received the first indoor bathtub in the United States. Bathing, however, was still not a universal custom. Only one year later — in 1843 — bathing between 1 November and 15 March was outlawed in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], as a health measure, and in 1845 bathing was banned in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], unless under the direct orders of a physician. The situation improved, however, and by 1867 in Philadelphia most houses of the well-to-do had tubs and indoor plumbing. In England, hot showers were installed in barracks and schools by the 1880s. The taboos against bathing disappeared with advancements in medical science; the worldwide medical community was even promoting the benefits of bathing. In addition, the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] taste for the exotic lent itself perfectly to seeking out the curative powers of thermal water.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

In most instances, the formal architectural development of European spas took place in the 18th and 19th centuries. The architecture of Bath, England, developed along [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] lines, generally following [[Palladian]] structures. The most important architectural form that emerged was the "crescent" — a semi-elliptical street plan used in many areas of England. The [[spa architecture]] of [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]], [[Marienbad]], [[Franzensbad]], and [[Baden-Baden]] was primarily Neoclassical, but the literature seems to indicate that large bathhouses were not constructed until well into the 19th century. The emphasis on drinking the waters rather than bathing in them led to the development of separate structures known as ''[[Trinkhallen]]'' (drinking halls) where those taking the cure spent hours drinking water from the springs.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

By the mid-19th century, the situation had changed dramatically. Visitors to the European spas began to stress bathing in addition to drinking the waters. Besides fountains, pavilions, and Trinkhallen, bathhouses on the scale of the Roman baths were revived. Photographs of a 19th-century spa complex taken in the 1930s, detailing the earlier architecture, show a heavy use of mosaic floors, marble walls, classical statuary, arched openings, domed ceilings, segmental arches, triangular pediments, [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns, and all the other trappings of a Neoclassical revival. The buildings were usually separated by function — with the ''Trinkhalle'', the bathhouse, the inhalatorium (for inhaling the vapors), and the ''Kurhaus'' or ''Conversationhaus'' that was the center of social activity. Baden-Baden featured golf courses and tennis courts, "superb roads to motor over, and drives along quaint lanes where wild deer are as common as cows to us, and almost as unafraid".&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

The European spa, then, started with structures to house the drinking function — from simple fountains to pavilions to elaborate Trinkhallen. The enormous bathhouses came later in the 19th century as a renewed preference for an elaborate bathing ritual to cure ills and improve health came into vogue. European architects looked back to Roman civilizations and carefully studied its fine architectural precedents. The Europeans copied the same formality, symmetry, division of rooms by function, and opulent interior design in their bathhouses. They emulated the fountains and formal garden spaces in their resorts, and they also added new diversions. The tour books always mentioned the roomy, woodsy offerings in the vicinity and the faster-paced evening diversions.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

[[File:CarolusThermen01.JPG|thumb|Waterfall, Carolus Spa, [[Aachen]], Germany]]

By the beginning of the 19th century, the European bathing regimen consisted of numerous accumulated traditions. The bathing routine included soaking in hot water, drinking the water, steaming in a vapor room, and relaxing in a cooling room. In addition doctors ordered that patients be douched with hot or cold water and given a select diet to promote a cure. Authors began writing guidebooks to the health resorts of Europe explaining the medical benefits and social amenities of each. Rich Europeans and Americans traveled to these resorts to take in cultural activities and the baths.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

Each European spa began offering similar cures while maintaining a certain amount of individuality. The 19th-century bathing regimen at Karlsbad can serve as a general portrayal of European bathing practices during this century. Visitors arose at 6 am to drink the water and be serenaded by a band. Next came a light breakfast, bath, and lunch. The doctors at Karlsbad usually limited patients to certain foods for each meal. In the afternoon, visitors went sight-seeing or attended concerts. Nightly theatrical performances followed the evening meal. This ended around 9 pm with the patients returning to their boardinghouses to sleep until 6 the next morning. This regimen continued for as long as a month and then the patients returned home until the next year. Other 19th-century European spa regimens followed similar schedules.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, European spas combined a strict diet and exercise regimen with a complex bathing procedure to achieve benefits for the patients. One example will suffice to illustrate the change in bathing procedures. Patients at [[Baden-Baden]], which specialized in treating [[rheumatoid arthritis]], were directed to see a doctor before taking the baths. Once this occurred, the bathers proceeded to the main bathhouse where they paid for their baths and stored their valuables before being assigned a booth for undressing. The bathhouse supplied bathers with towels, sheets, and slippers.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

The Baden-Baden bathing procedure began with a warm shower. The bathers next entered a room of circulating, {{convert|140|F|C}} hot air for 20 minutes, spent another ten minutes in a room with {{convert|150|F|C}} temperature, partook of a {{convert|154|F|C}} vapor bath, then showered and received a soap massage. After the massage, the bathers swam in a pool heated approximately to body temperature. After the swim, the bathers rested for 15 to 20 minutes in the warm "Sprudel" room pool . This shallow pool's bottom contained an {{convert|8|in|mm|sing=on}} layer of sand through with naturally carbonated water bubbled up. This was followed by a series of gradually cooler showers and pools. After that, the attendants rubbed down the bathers with warm towels and then wrapped them in sheets and covered them with blankets to rest for 20 minutes. This ended the bathing portion of the treatment. The rest of the cure consisted of a prescribed diet, exercise, and water-drinking program.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

The European spas provided various other diversions for guests after the bath, including gambling, horse racing, fishing, hunting, tennis, skating, dancing, golf, and horseback riding. Sight-seeing and theatrical performances served as further incentives for people to go to the spa. Some European governments even recognized the medical benefits of spa therapy and paid a portion of the patient's expenses. A number of these spas catered to those suffering from obesity and overindulgence in addition to various other medical complaints. In recent years, elegance and style of earlier centuries may have diminished, but people still come to the natural hot springs for relaxation and health.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt; In Germany, the tradition survives to the present day. 'Taking a cure' (''[[Kur]]'') at a spa is covered 100% by both public and private health care insurance, as mandated by federal legislation. Typically, a doctor prescribes a few weeks, no less than two weeks, but generally four to six weeks, stay at a mineral spring or other natural setting where a patient's condition will be treated with healing spring waters and natural therapies. In addition to the treatment and accommodations even all meals and drinks as well as entertainment is paid for by the insurance. Most Germans are eligible every two to six years, depending on the severity of the condition. Germans get paid their regular salary during this time away from their job which is not taken out of their vacation days.

===In colonial America===
[[File:Jefferson Pools Gentlemen.JPG|right|thumb|230px|Gentlemen's Pool House, [[Jefferson Pools]], Warm Springs, Virginia, built 1761 it is the oldest spa building in the United States. The spa waters flow through the centre of the building. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] bathed here.]]

Some European colonists brought with them knowledge of the hot water therapy for medicinal purposes, and others learned the benefits of hot springs from the Native Americans. Europeans gradually obtained many of the hot and cold springs from the various Indian tribes. They then developed the spring to suit European tastes. By the 1760s, British colonists were traveling to hot and cold springs in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia in search of water cures. Among the more frequently visited of these springs were [[Bath, Pennsylvania|Bath]], [[Chester Springs, Pennsylvania|Yellow]], and [[Bristol Township, Pennsylvania|Bristol Springs]] in Pennsylvania; and [[Warm Springs, Virginia|Warm Springs]], [[Hot Springs, Virginia|Hot Springs]], and [[White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia|White Sulphur Springs]] (now in West Virginia) in Virginia.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt; In the last decade of the 1700s, New York spas were beginning to be frequented by intrepid travelers, most notably [[Ballston Spa, New York|Ballston Spa]]. Nearby [[Saratoga Springs]] and [[Kinderhook, New York|Kinderhook]] were yet to be discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Gassan, ''Birth of American Tourism'', 2008, pp. 1-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, ''Drinking the Waters,'' 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonial doctors gradually began to recommend hot springs for ailments. Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]], American patriot and physician, praised the springs of Bristol, Pennsylvania, in 1773. Dr. [[Samuel Tenney]] in 1783 and Dr. [[Valentine Seaman]] in 1792 examined the water of Ballston Spa in New York and wrote of possible medicinal uses of the springs. Hotels were constructed to accommodate visitors to the various springs. Entrepreneurs operated establishments where the travelers could lodge, eat, and drink. Thus began the health resort industry in the United States.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

===Bathing in 19th- and 20th-century America===
After the [[American Revolution]], the spa industry continued to gain popularity. The first truly popular spa was [[Saratoga Springs]], which, by 1815, had two large, four-story, [[Greek revival]] hotels. It grew rapidly, and by 1821 it had at least five hundred rooms for accommodation. Its relative proximity to New York City and access to the country's most developed steamboat lines meant that by the mid-1820s the spa became the country's most popular tourist destination, serving both the country's elite and a more middle-class audience.&lt;ref&gt;Gassan, ''Birth of American Tourism,'' 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, ''Drinking the Waters,'' Smithsonian Institution Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Although spa activity had been central to Saratoga in the 1810s, by the 1820s the resort had hotels with great ballrooms, opera houses, stores, and clubhouses. The Union Hotel (first built in 1803 but steadily expanded over the coming decades) had its own esplanade, and by the 1820s had its own fountain and formal landscaping, but with only two small bathhouses. As the resort developed as a tourist destination mineral bathhouses became auxiliary structures and not the central features of the resort, although the drinking of mineral water was at least followed as a pro-forma activity by most in attendance, despite nightly dinners that were elaborate and extensive. Although Saratoga and other spas in New York centered their developments around the healthful mineral waters, their real drawing card was a complex social life and a cultural cachet. However, the wider audience it garnered by the late 1820s began to take some of the bloom off the resort, and in the mid-1830s, as a successful bid to revive itself, it turned to horse racing.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gassan, ''Birth of American Tourism'', pp. 125-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1850s hot and cold spring resorts existed in 20 states. Many of these resorts contained similar architectural features. Most health resorts had a large, two-story central building near or at the springs, with smaller structures surrounding it. The main building provided the guests with facilities for dining, and possibly, dancing on the first floor, and the second story consisted of sleeping rooms. The outlying structures were individual guest cabins, and other auxiliary buildings formed a semicircle or U-shape around the large building.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

These resorts offered swimming, fishing, hunting, and horseback riding as well as facilities for bathing. The Virginia resorts, particularly White Sulphur Springs, proved popular before and after the Civil War. After the Civil War, spa vacations became very popular as returning soldiers bathed to heal wounds and the American economy allowed more leisure time. Saratoga Springs in New York became one of the main centers for this type of activity. Bathing in and drinking the warm, carbonated spring water only served as a prelude to the more interesting social activities of gambling, promenading, horse racing, and dancing.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer-Lewis, ''Ladies and Gentlemen on Display'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, ''Drinking the Waters'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last half of the 19th century, western entrepreneurs developed natural hot and cold springs into resorts — from the [[Mississippi River]] to the West Coast. Many of these spas offered individual tub baths, vapor baths, douche sprays, needle showers, and pool bathing to their guests. The various railroads that spanned the country promoted these resorts to encourage train travel. [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], became a major resort for people from the large metropolitan areas of [[St. Louis]] and [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

The popularity of the spas continued into the 20th century. Some medical critics, however, charged that the thermal waters in such renowned resorts as Hot Springs, Virginia, and Saratoga Springs, New York, were no more beneficial to health than ordinary heated water. The various spa owners countered these arguments by developing better hydrotherapy for their patients. At the Saratoga spa, treatments for heart and circulatory disorders, rheumatic conditions, nervous disorders, metabolic diseases, and skin diseases were developed. In 1910, the New York state government began purchasing the principal springs to protect them from exploitation. When [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] was governor of New York, he pushed for a European type of spa development at Saratoga. The architects for the new complex spent two years studying the technical aspects of bathing in Europe. Completed in 1933, the development had three bathhouses — Lincoln, Washington, and Roosevelt — a drinking hall, the Hall of Springs, and a building housing the [[Simon Baruch Research Institute]]. Four additional buildings composed the recreation area and housed arcades and a swimming pool decorated with blue faience terra-cotta tile. [[Saratoga Spa State Park]]'s Neoclassical buildings were laid out in a grand manner, with formal perpendicular axes, solid brick construction, and stone and concrete Roman-revival detailing. The spa was surrounded by a {{convert|1200|acre|km2|sing=on}} natural park that had {{convert|18|mi|km}} of bridle paths, "with measured walks at scientifically calculated gradients through its groves and vales, with spouting springs adding unexpected touches to its vistas, with the tumbling waters of Geyser Brook flowing beneath bridges of the fine roads.  Full advantage has been taken of the natural beauty of the park, but no formal landscaping". Promotional literature again advertised the attractions directly outside the spa: shopping, horse races, and historic sites associated with revolutionary war history. New York Governor [[Herbert Lehman]] opened the new facilities to the public in July 1935.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

Other leading spas in the U.S. during this period were [[French Lick, Indiana]]; Hot Springs and White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia; Hot Springs, Arkansas; and [[Warm Springs, Georgia]]. French Lick specialized in treating obesity and constipation through a combination of bathing and drinking the water and exercising. Hot Springs, Virginia, specialized in digestive ailments and heart diseases, and White Sulphur Springs, Virginia, treated these ailments and skin diseases. Both resorts offered baths where the water would wash continuously over the patients as they lay in a shallow pool. Warm Springs, Georgia, gained a reputation for treating [[infantile paralysis]] by a procedure of baths and exercise. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who earlier supported Saratoga, became a frequent visitor and promoter of this spa.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt;

==Recent trends==
By the late 1930s more than 2,000 hot- or cold-springs health resorts were operating in the United States. This number had diminished greatly by the 1950s and continued to decline in the following two decades. In the recent past, spas in the U.S. emphasized dietary, exercise, or recreational programs more than traditional bathing activities.

Up until recently,{{when|date=October 2013}}&lt;!-- is 1987 so recent?--&gt; the public bathing industry in the U.S. remained stagnant.&lt;ref name=Paige1987 /&gt; Nevertheless, in Europe, therapeutic baths have always been very popular, and remain so today.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The same is true in [[Japan]], where the traditional hot springs baths, known as ''[[onsen]]'', always attracted plenty of visitors.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

But also in the U.S., with the increasing focus on health and wellness, such treatments are again becoming popular.&lt;ref&gt;"The increasing focus on fitness and wellness has fuelled the reemergence of the spa industry..." Anne Williams, ''Spa bodywork: a guide for massage therapists.'' Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2006. p. 173. {{ISBN|0-7817-5578-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of treatments==
* [[Day spa]], a form of beauty salon.
* [[Destination spa]], a resort for personal care treatments.
* [[Spa town]], a town visited for the supposed healing properties of the water.
* Foot spa
* [[Hot tub]], in United States usage.
* [[Spa (mineral water)]], from the sources in Spa.
* [[Ganban'yoku]], a hot stone spa
* Spas usually offer [[mud bath]]s for general health, or to address a variety of medical conditions. This is also known as '[[fangotherapy]]'. A variety of [[medicinal clay]]s and [[Peat pulp bath|peats]] is used.&lt;ref&gt;"The increasing focus on fitness and wellness has fuelled the reemergence of the spa industry and, with it, the use of fango ([[medicinal clay]]) for healing." Anne Williams, ''Spa bodywork: a guide for massage therapists.'' Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2006. p. 173. {{ISBN|0-7817-5578-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stockholm International Peace Research Institute''' ('''SIPRI''') is an  [[international]] [[institute]] based in [[Sweden]], dedicated to research into [[Conflict resolution|conflict]], [[armaments]], [[arms control]] and [[disarmament]]. Established in 1966, SIPRI provides data, analysis and recommendations, based on [[open source]]s, to [[policymaker]]s, researchers, media and the interested public. SIPRI is based in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sipri.org/about|title=About SIPRI {{!}} SIPRI|website=www.sipri.org|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[University of Pennsylvania]] [[Lauder Institute]]'s ''2016 Global Go To Think Tanks Report'', SIPRI was ranked 28th among [[think tank]]s worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;James G. McGann, [https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&amp;context=think_tanks 2016 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report], January 2017, [[University of Pennsylvania]] [[Lauder Institute]], p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1964, [[Prime Minister of Sweden]] [[Tage Erlander]] put forward the idea of establishing a peace research institute to commemorate Sweden's 150 years of unbroken peace.

A Swedish Royal Commission chaired by Ambassador [[Alva Myrdal]] proposed in its 1966 report to establish an institute, later named the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI. The Institute's research should seek to contribute to "the understanding of the preconditions for a stable peace and for peaceful solutions of international conflicts" and the Commission recommended that research be concentrated on armaments, their limitation and reduction, and [[arms control]]. The Commission also recommended that SIPRI work be of "an applied research character directed towards practical-political questions [which] should be carried on in a constant interchange with research of a more theoretical kind".

SIPRI has built its reputation and standing on competence, professional skills, and the collection of hard data and precise facts, rendering accessible impartial information on weapon developments, arms transfers and production, military expenditure, as well as on arms limitations, reductions and disarmament. The task of the Institute is to conduct "scientific research on questions of conflict and cooperation of importance for international peace and security with the aim of contributing to an understanding of the conditions for peaceful solution of international conflicts and for a stable peace".

The Swedish [[Riksdag]] decided that the Institute be established on 1 July 1966 with the legal status of an independent foundation. All SIPRI research is based exclusively on [[open source]]s.

==Organisation==

SIPRI's organisation consists of a Governing Board, Director, Deputy Director, Research Staff Collegium and support staff. An Advisory Committee serves as a consultative body to the Institute. The Governing Board takes decisions on important matters concerning the research agenda, activities, organisation and financial administration of the Institute. Other matters are decided by the Director. The Research Staff Collegium advises the Director on research matters. The staff of about 50 persons is international. The researchers are recruited for a specific project period and represent various academic disciplines. Located in Sweden, the Institute offers a unique platform for researchers from different countries to work in close cooperation. The Institute also hosts guest researchers who work on issues related to the SIPRI research programme. Although SIPRI is not a teaching institute, it receives interns whose programmes of study can contribute to and benefit from SIPRI's research. Contacts are maintained with other research centres and individual researchers throughout the world. SIPRI cooperates closely with several intergovernmental organisations, notably the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]], and regularly receives parliamentary, scientific and government delegations as well as visiting researchers. Frequent contacts are maintained with [[diplomatic mission]]s in Stockholm and with Swedish research centres.

Within these fields of study, workshops, conferences, seminars and lectures are organised in order to bring together a broad spectrum of expertise and to exchange views on subjects studied at the Institute. Among these the biggest are the Stockholm Forum on Peace and Security and the Stockholm Security Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sipri.org/events/2017-stockholm-security-conference|title=2017 Stockholm Security Conference {{!}} SIPRI|website=www.sipri.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; SIPRI research projects maintain large databases on military expenditure, arms-producing industries, arms transfers, chemical and biological warfare, national and international export controls, arms control agreements, annual chronologies of major arms control events, military manoeuvres and nuclear explosions.

==Publications and information==

SIPRI's publications and information material are distributed to a wide range of policy makers, researchers, journalists, organisations and the interested public. The results of the research are disseminated through the publication of books and reports by SIPRI and commissioned authors as well as through symposia and seminars. The Institute has forged its profile by concentrating on present-day realities, providing unbiased facts to states and individuals. SIPRI's main publication, the SIPRI Yearbook, was first published on 12 November 1969. The Yearbook serves as a single authoritative and independent source to which politicians, diplomats and journalists can turn for an account of what has happened during the past year in armaments and arms control, armed conflicts and conflict resolution, security arrangements and disarmament. It is translated into a number of other languages, notably [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

[[Image:Lanna cm2.jpg|thumb|300px|A name board on a [[wat]] in [[Chiang Mai]] written in the [[Tai Tham alphabet]]  ("[[Lan Na]] alphabet", {{lang|th|อักษรธรรมล้านนา}}). The use of this script was discouraged and the [[Northern Thai language]] is now written with the [[Thai alphabet]].]]

'''Thaification''', or "Thai-ization" is the process by which people of different cultural and ethnic origins living in [[Thailand]] become [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] to the dominant culture of Thailand, that of [[central Thailand]].

Thaification was a step in the creation in the 20th century of the Thai [[nation state]] in which [[Thai people]] occupy a dominant position, as opposed to the historically multicultural kingdom of [[Siam]]. A related term, "Thainess", describes the particular characteristics that distinguish Thai persons from others.

==Motives==
Thaification is a byproduct of the [[nationalist]] policies mandated by the Thai state after the [[Siamese coup d'état of 1933]]. The coup leaders, said to be inspired by [[Western world|Western]] ideas of an exclusive [[nation state]], acted more in accordance with their close German nationalist and anti-democratic counterparts (pre-Nazi) to effect kingdom-wide dominance by the central Thai culture. Minority-owned businesses, like the traditionally merchant [[Thai Chinese]], were aggressively acquired by the state, which gave preferential contracts to [[Thai people|ethnic Thais]] and cooperative ethnic Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colonial Legacies: Economic and Social Development in East and Southeast Asia|first=Anne|last=Booth|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|year=2007|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thai identity was mandated and reinforced both in the heartlands and in rural areas. [[Central Thailand]] became economically and politically dominant, and central Thai (differentiated from multi-lingual Siamese) became the state-mandated language of the [[Media of Thailand|media]], business, education, and all state agencies. Central Thai values were successfully inculcated into being perceived as the desirable national values, with increasing proportions of the population identified as Thai. [[Culture of Bangkok#Culture|Central Thai culture]], being the culture of wealth and status, made it hugely attractive to a once-diverse population seeking to be identified with [[nationalist]] unity.

==Targets==
The main targets of Thaification were [[Ethnic groups in Thailand|ethnic groups]] on the edges of the kingdom, geographically and culturally: the [[Lao people|Lao]] of [[Isan]] (อีสาน),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ganjanakhundee|first1=Supalak|title=Lao are lazy: The problem with 'Thai superiority'|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Lao-are-lazy-The-problem-with-Thai-superiority-30296890.html|accessdate=6 October 2016|work=The Nation|date=5 October 2016|format=Opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hill tribe (Thailand)|hill tribes]] of western and [[northern Thailand]], and the [[Muslim]] (มุสลิม) [[ethnic Malay]] minority of [[southern Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ivanoff|first=Jacques|title=The Cultural Roots of Violence in Malay Southern Thailand: Comparative Mythology; Soul of Rice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F_RKmwEACAAJ|year=2010|publisher=White Lotus Company Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haji Umar|first1=Umaiyah|title=The Assimilation of Bangkok-Melayu Communities in the Bangkok Metropolis and Surrounding Areas|date=2003|isbn=9789749121344}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been a Thaification of the large immigrant [[Thai Chinese]] population.

==Policies==
Thaification by the government can be separated into three sets of policies:

===Rural development===
In the first set of policies, the government targeted specific policies and actions at fringe groups. An example of this is the Accelerated Rural Development Programme of 1964, the Isan component of which included the strengthening of allegiance to [[Bangkok]] and the rest of the country as one of its objectives.

===Education===
The second set of policies consists of policies applied nationally, but that disproportionately affect fringe groups. One example of this is the prescribed use of [[Thai language|Central Thai]] language in schools. This had little effect on the central Thai or ''Thai Siam'' who already used the language as a mother tongue, but made bilinguals of speakers of [[Isan language|Isan]] in the northeast, of [[Northern Thai language|Northern Thai]] ({{lang|th|คำเมือง}}) in the north, and of [[Pattani Malay]] ({{lang|th|ยาวี}}) in the south.

Harsher methods were imposed on the Thai Chinese.&lt;ref name=Identities&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alternate Identities: The Chinese of Contemporary Thailand|author=Tong, Chee Kiong|author2=Chan, Kwok Bun |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=2001|pages=170–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[China|People's Republic of China]] was founded in 1949, a series of anticommunist Thai military juntas, starting with that of dictator [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]], sharply reduced Chinese immigration and prohibited [[Chinese school]]s in Thailand.&lt;ref name=Identities /&gt;

Thai Chinese born after the 1950s had "very limited opportunities to enter Chinese schools".&lt;ref name=Identities /&gt; Those Thai Chinese who could afford to study overseas studied [[English language|English]] instead of Chinese for economic reasons.&lt;ref name=Identities /&gt; As a result, the Chinese in Thailand have "almost totally lost the language of their ancestors", and are gradually losing their Chinese identity.&lt;ref name=Identities /&gt;

===Encouraging Thai nationalism===
A third set of policies was designed to encourage Thai nationalism in the nation's peoples. Examples include the promotion of the [[Thai monarchy|king]] as a national figurehead, saluting the [[Flag of Thailand|flag]] in school and the twice daily broadcasts of the [[Thai National Anthem|national anthem]] ({{lang-th|เพลงชาติ}}; {{rtgs|''phleng chat''}}) on [[radio]] and [[television]] at 08:00 and 18:00. Encouraging Thai nationalism had the intended side effect of discouraging other loyalties, such as that to [[Laos]], stemming from central Thais' perceived threat of Lao cultural and political dominance in the Isan region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reyland|first1=William|title=Sons of Isan|date=2009|publisher=Booksmango|isbn=6162450651|page=47|edition=Google Books|url=https://books.google.co.th/books?id=7-P6a6KL3PcC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=%22the+influence+and+predominance+of+Lao+culture+in+the+twentieth+century+prompted+the+Thai+government+to+assert+its+control+over+Isan+through+a+program+termed%22&amp;lr=&amp;output=html_text&amp;hl=en|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that of Malay ({{lang-th|มลายู}}; {{rtgs|''malayu''}}) in the south. Similar programs exist to the present day. In 2018 the Thai [[National Council for Peace and Order|government]] created  a "soft power" campaign called ''Thai Niyom'' (Thai-ism) ({{lang-th|ไทยนิยม}}; {{rtgs|''thai niyom''}}) to reinforce the notion of [[Thai exceptionalism]]. It includes "12 Core Values", reminiscent of the earlier [[Thai cultural mandates]]. The campaign has been criticized by some academics as "mere state propaganda".&lt;ref name="Nation-20180527"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phataranawik|first1=Phatarawadee|title=SPECIAL REPORT: How the junta misused culture to boost 'Thai-ism'|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30346263|accessdate=28 May 2018|work=The Nation|date=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Age of Empire: 1875–1914''''' is a book by the British historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]], published in 1987. It is the third in a trilogy of books about "[[the long 19th century]]" (coined by Hobsbawm), preceded by ''[[The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848]]'' and ''[[The Age of Capital: 1848–1875]]''. A fourth book, ''[[The Age of Extremes|The Age of Extremes: The Short Twentieth Century, 1914–1991]]'', acts as a sequel to the trilogy.

==Themes==
The period of less than fifty years described by Hobsbawm began with an [[economic depression]] (see [[Long Depression]]), but the capitalist world economy quickly recovered, although the dominant [[British economy]] was  being undermined by the [[German economy]] and [[Economy of the United States|American economy]].&lt;ref name="up"/&gt; Rising productivity resulted in increasing flow of goods, and rising living standards.&lt;ref name=up/&gt; Despite that, [[economic inequality|inequality]] was growing, both on the national and international levels.&lt;ref name=up/&gt; In the cultural sphere, it was the period of the ''[[Belle Époque]]'', the swan-song of [[aristocracy]], increasingly marginalized by the growing affluence of the [[upper middle class]] ([[bourgeois]]), which can be seen as the class most benefiting from changes of that period.&lt;ref name=up/&gt;

It was also a period of [[peace]], with Europe and the [[Western world]] involved in only a few minor conflicts.&lt;ref name=up/&gt; This led to a popular belief that no significant wars would happen in the future, an era of widespread [[optimism]].&lt;ref name=up/&gt; At the same time, the [[military-industrial complex]] in all countries was busily stocking supplies for the conflict to come.&lt;ref name=up/&gt; In the background, the belief in [[progress (history)|progress]] and [[science]] was clashing with the old forces of [[religion]]. The West, dominating the world through its [[colonialism|colonial system]], was also increasingly interested in foreign cultures.&lt;ref name=up/&gt; It was such internal contradictions and tensions that for Hobsbawm defined this era, and spelled its inevitable end.&lt;ref name=up/&gt;

The ending of the Hobswawn trilogy sees the end of the era that began with the [[dual revolution]] (the [[French Revolution]] and the [[industrial revolution]]).&lt;ref name=up/&gt; Inspired by [[Vladimir Lenin]], Hobsbawm, a writer widely recognized as a [[Marxist]], traces the development of [[capitalism]], linking it with the development of [[imperialism]] that resulted in the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=up/&gt; Unlike Lenin, who predicted that this will lead to capitalism's downfall, and with the benefit of almost a century more of a hindsight, Hobsbawm acknowledges that capitalism survived, although in a form different from that which it began with in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name=up/&gt; Facing the dangers of a competing ideology, that of [[communism]], and another revolution (the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]), capitalism, according to Hobsbawm, survived by appeasing the masses and accepting some [[socialist]] demands, such as that of the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref name=up/&gt;

"'''The Problem with a Poo'''" is the third episode of the [[South Park (season 22)|twenty-second season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 290th overall episode of the series, it aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on October 10, 2018.

The episode explores modern [[political correctness]] as the people of South Park turn against longtime recurring character [[Mr. Hankey]], and Vice Principal [[List of South Park Elementary staff#Strong Woman|Strong Woman]] and [[PC Principal]] deal with the fallout from their fling at the end of the previous season. These themes are also seen in the episode's references to the documentary ''[[The Problem with Apu]]'', the cancellation of ''[[Roseanne]]'' after controversial tweets by the [[Roseanne Barr|show's eponymous actress]], and the [[Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination|confirmation hearings]] of Supreme Court Justice [[Brett Kavanaugh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/south-park-goes-roseanne-barr-simpsons-apu-character-1151462|title='South Park' Goes After Roseanne Barr, 'Simpsons' Apu Character|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=October 11, 2018|date=October 10, 2018|last=Parker|first=Ryan|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barsanti|first=Sam|date=October 9, 2018|url=https://news.avclub.com/south-park-will-somehow-tackle-both-brett-kavanaugh-and-1829634344|title=''South Park'' will somehow tackle both Brett Kavanaugh and ''The Problem With Apu'' simultaneously|website=[[The A.V.

==Plot==
At a South Park City Council meeting, [[Mr. Hankey]], a sentient piece of feces and the director of the town's Christmas pageant, is told that the budget for his show has been cut in half. Despite the fact that many in town like him, he is told that many others are offended by him due to his scatological nature. After taking his anger out on South Park Elementary's music students, both during class and with a series of [[politically incorrect]] tweets, the City Council fires him. Unable to find a lawyer to accept his case, he enlists [[Kyle Broflovski]] since Kyle's father is a lawyer. At a public hearing, greater scrutiny is placed upon his history of offensive tweets, which he attempts to minimize as failed attempts at humor that he blames on his use of [[Ambien]]. He also argues that preparing for the upcoming Christmas show is more important than focusing on such indiscretions.

Vice Principal [[List of South Park Elementary staff#Strong Woman|Strong Woman]], pregnant following her fling with [[PC Principal]] in "[[Super Hard PCness]]" and "[[Splatty Tomato]]", tells PC Principal that their affair was a mistake, and that she wishes to break up with him. PC Principal, despite his concerns over whether this is possible, reluctantly agrees, and the two organize a school assembly on [[in vitro fertilization]] in order to stave off speculation that Strong Woman became pregnant through sex or any other questions over the father of her children. She gives birth to [[wikt:Special:Search/quintuplet|quintuplets]] who turn out to be highly [[politically correct|politically correct (PC)]] and bear a strong resemblance to PC Principal, but she refuses to acknowledge that he is the children's father. PC Principal, not being able to stay away from his children, proposes that they tell others that he is the children's [[nanny|male nanny]], or "manny".

Feeling that people have forgotten what the spirit of Christmas is about, Mr. Hankey enlists Kyle to help him put on a musical performance in the park, but when politically incorrect humor offends PC Principal's and Strong Woman's PC babies, they begin crying. Their distress continues even after Mr. Hankey ceases his politically incorrect material, because it is explained to him that "sometimes PC babies don't know what they're crying about." Mr. Hankey angrily excoriates the townsfolk for this, and when Kyle tries stop him, an altercation ensues that destroys their stage. South Park severs all ties with Mr. Hankey, ending the long Christmas association between him and the town. Mr. Hankey leaves town, in search of a place that still accepts objectionable, racist beings like him. He arrives in the fictional town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], the setting of the animated TV series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', where the characters native to that show, in particular [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], welcome him with open arms. A title card is then shown that reads "#cancelthesimpsons".

==Reception==
Jesse Schedeen rated the episode 4.3 out of 10 in a review for [[IGN]], offering the verdict, "This episode tries to [[You can't have your cake and eat it|have its cake and eat it too]] by attacking badly behaving celebrities and outrage culture at the same time, and it fails to accomplish either. The funny moments this week can't outweigh the jumbled, frustrating narrative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schedeen |first1=Jesse |title=South Park: 'The Problem With a Poo' Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/11/south-park-the-problem-with-a-poo-review |publisher=[[IGN]]|date=October 10, 2018 |accessdate=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Hugar with ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' rated the episode a C, summarizing his review stating "'The Problem With A Poo' was a convoluted attempt to insert too many of-the-moment references into one half-hour without definitively saying anything about the possibility of redemption for once-beloved entertainers who engage in abusive behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hugar |first1=John |title=''South Park'' takes a legendary character down in an episode lacking a coherent message |url=https://tv.avclub.com/south-park-takes-a-legendary-character-down-in-an-episo-1829672775 |website=The A.V.

Aggregated measure of quantitative, qualitative, regulatory and market based risks to local availability of adequate water supply, as well as risk of flooding.]]

'''Water security''' has been defined as "the reliable availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health, livelihoods and production, coupled with an acceptable level of water-related risks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iwaponline.com/wp/00906/wp009060545.htm |journal=Water Policy |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=545–571 |author=David Grey |author2=Claudia W.

Water security for growth and development |publisher=Iwaponline.com |date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is realised to the degree that [[water scarcity]] is non-existent, or has been decreased or eliminated, and to the degree that [[flood]]s and [[Water pollution|contamination]] of freshwater supplies are non-threatening.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[[Sustainable development]] will not be achieved without a [[water]] secure world. A water secure world integrates a concern for the intrinsic value of water with a concern for its use for human survival and well-being. A water secure world harnesses water's productive power and minimises its destructive force. Water security also means addressing environmental protection and the negative effects of poor management. It is also concerned with ending fragmented responsibility for water and integrating water resources management across all sectors—finance, planning, agriculture, energy, tourism, industry, education and health. A water secure world [[poverty reduction|reduces poverty]], advances education, and increases living standards. It is a world where there is an improved [[quality of life]] for all, especially for the most vulnerable—usually women and children—who benefit most from good [[water governance]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwp.org/The-Challenge/What-is-water-security/ |title=What is Water Security? - THE CHALLENGE - Global Water Partnership |publisher=Gwp.org |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The areas of the world that are most likely to have water insecurity are places with low [[rain]]fall, places with rapid [[population growth]] in a [[Water scarcity|freshwater scarce]] area, and areas with international competition over a [[water source]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2010/3106/|title=USGS Fact Sheet 2010-3106: Water Security—National and Global Issues|last=A.A.|first=Tindall, J.A., Campbell,|website=pubs.usgs.gov|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Water security is achieved when there is enough water for everyone in a region and the water supply is not at risk of disappearing.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; According to the [[Pacific Institute]] "While regional impacts will vary, global [[climate change]] will potentially alter agricultural productivity, freshwater availability and quality, access to vital minerals, coastal and island flooding, and more. Among the consequences of these impacts will be challenges to political relationships, realignment of energy markets and regional economies, and threats to security".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacinst.org/topics/global_change/climate_security/index.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905020030/http://www.pacinst.org/topics/global_change/climate_security/index.htm |date=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It impacts regions, states and countries. Tensions exist between upstream and downstream users of water within individual jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=4406040&amp;q=%22water+security%22&amp;uid=&amp;setcookie=yes|title=Retrieved 2009-01-19|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During history there has been much conflict over use of water from [[river]]s such as the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] Rivers.&lt;ref name="stormingmedia.us"&gt;http://www.stormingmedia.us/75/7593/A759324.html Retrieved 2009-01-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Another highly politicized example is [[Israel|Israel's]] control of water resources in the [[Levant]] region since its creation,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jameel M. Zayed]], No Peace Without Water – The Role of Hydropolitics in the Israel-Palestine Conflict http://www.jnews.org.uk/commentary/“no-peace-without-water”-–-the-role-of-hydropolitics-in-the-israel-palestine-conflict&lt;/ref&gt; where Israel securing its water resources was one of several drivers for the 1967 [[Six-Day War]].

Water security is sometimes sought by implementing [[water desalination]], [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] between sources and users, water licences with different security levels and [[war]].

Water allocation between competing users is increasingly determined by application of market-based pricing for either water licenses or actual water.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Webb]] and Maria Iskandarani, Water Insecurity and the Poor: Issues and Research Needs. http://www.zef.de/fileadmin/webfiles/downloads/zef_dp/zef_dp2-98.pdf, Center for Development Research, Discussion Papers on Development Policy No. 2, Bonn, October 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fresh water==
Water, in absolute terms, is not in short supply planet-wide. But, according to the United Nations water organization, UN-Water, the total usable freshwater supply for ecosystems and humans is only about 200,000 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water – less than one percent (&lt;1%) of all freshwater resources. Usable fresh water includes water not contaminated or degraded by water-altering chemicals, such as sewage or any other harmful chemicals from continuous previous use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Viessman Jr.|first1=Warren|title=Population and Water Resources|url=http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Po-Re/Population-and-Water-Resources.html|website=Water Encyclopedia Science and Issues|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, water use has been growing at more than twice the rate of the population increase. Specifically, water withdrawals are predicted to increase by 50 percent by 2025 in developing countries, and 18 per cent in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barbier|first1=Edward|title=Handbook of Water Economics|date=September 25, 2015|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|page=550&lt;!--|pages=552--&gt;|url=https://books.google.com/?id=166CCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA500&amp;lpg=PA500&amp;dq=water+withdrawals+are+predicted+to+increase+by+50+percent+by+2025#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 December 2016|isbn=9781782549666}}&lt;/ref&gt; One continent, for example, Africa, has been predicted to have 75 to 250 million inhabitants lacking access to fresh water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballooning global population adding to water crisis, warns new UN report|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=30167&amp;Cr=water&amp;Cr1=supply#.WEYuHLIrLIU|website=United Nations News Centre|publisher=UN News Centre|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/scarcity.shtml ]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2050, more than half of the world's population will live in water-stressed areas, and another billion may lack sufficient water, MIT researchers find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Alli Gold|title=Predicting the future of global water stress|url=http://news.mit.edu/2014/predicting-the-future-of-global-water-stress|accessdate=22 December 2017|work=MIT News|date=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threats ==
The most common threat to water security is [[water scarcity]]. There can be several causes to water scarcity including low rainfall, climate change,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com.proxy.library.cmu.edu/docview/304741876?pq-origsite=summon&amp;http://search.library.cmu.edu/link/http://search.proquest.com/pqdtglobal/|title=Beyond the water's edge: United States national security and the ocean environment|last=Di Mento|first=John Mark|date=December 2006|website=Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy (Tufts University), ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; high population density, and overallocation of a water source. An example of periodic water scarcity in the United States is [[droughts in California]]. Another category of threats to water security is environmental threats.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnold|first=Craig Anthony|date=March 22, 2009|title=Water privatization trends in the United States: human rights, national security, and public stewardship|url=|journal=William and Mary environmental law and policy review|volume=33|pages=785}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include  contaminates such as [[Biological hazard|biohazards]] (biological substances that can harm humans), climate change and [[natural disaster]]s. [[Contaminants]] can enter a water source naturally through flooding. Contaminants can also be a problem if a population switches their water supply from surface water to groundwater. Natural disasters such as [[hurricanes]], [[earthquake]]s, and [[wildfire]]s can damage man-made structures such as [[dam]]s and fill [[waterway]]s with [[debris]]. Other threats to water security include [[terrorism]] and [[radiation]] due to a [[Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents|nuclear accident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/water-and-wastewater-systems-sector|title=Water and Wastewater Systems Sector {{!}} Homeland Security|website=www.dhs.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
[[File:Thailand nan river fishing.jpg|thumb|Thailand nan river fishing]]
According to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' (2010), about 80% of the world's population (5.6 billion in 2011) live in areas with threats to water security. The water security is a shared threat to human and nature and it is pandemic. Human water-management strategies can be detrimental to wildlife, such as migrating fish. Regions with intensive agriculture and dense populations, such as the US and Europe, have a high threat of water security. Water is increasingly being used as a weapon in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Report: Water and Violence Link: http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/63948150123-web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Water insecurity is always accompanied by one or more issues such as poverty, war and conflict, low women’s development and environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/mena/jordan/refugees-exacerbate-water-crisis-in-middle-east-1.1475639|title=Refugees exacerbate water crisis in Middle East|first=Jumana Khamis, Staff|last=Reporter|date=22 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers estimate that during 2010-2015, ca US$800 billion will be required to cover the annual global investment in [[water infrastructure]]. Good management of water resources can jointly manage [[biodiversity]] protection and human water security. Preserving flood plains rather than constructing flood-control reservoirs would provide a cost-effective way to control floods while protecting the biodiversity of wildlife that occupies such areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100929/full/news.2010.505.html Balancing water supply and wildlife] Nature online 29 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence Smith, the president of the population institute, asserts that although an overwhelming majority of the planet's surface is composed of water, 97% of this water is constituted of saltwater; the [[fresh water]] used to sustain humans is only 3% of the total amount of water on Earth.&lt;ref name=Hoevel&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Smith believes that the competition for water in an overpopulated world would pose a major threat to human stability,&lt;ref name=Hoevel/&gt; even going so far as to postulate apocalyptic world wars being fought over the control of thinning ice sheets and nearly desiccated reservoirs.&lt;ref name=Hoevel/&gt; Nevertheless, 2 billion people have supposedly gained access to a safe water source since 1990 who may have earlier lacked it.&lt;ref name="MDG"&gt;{{cite web

The [[Earth]] has a limited though renewable [[water supply|supply of fresh water]], stored in [[aquifer]]s, [[surface water]]s and the [[atmosphere]]. [[Ocean]]s are a good source of usable water, but the amount of energy needed to convert [[saline water]] to [[potable water]] is prohibitive with conventional approaches, explaining why only a very small fraction of the world's water supply is derived from [[desalination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | title=World Energy Outlook 2005: Middle East and North Africa Insights
 | publisher=International Energy Agency, Paris
 | year=2005
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern technologies, such as the [[Seawater Greenhouse]], use solar energy to desalinate seawater for agriculture and drinking uses in an extremely cost-effective manner.

==International competition==
{{See also|Water conflict#Notable conflicts}}
International competition over water can arise when one country starts drawing more water from a shared water source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Water : a source of conflict or cooperation?|last=Grover|first=Velma I.|publisher=Science Publishers|year=2007|isbn=|location=Enfield, N.H.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often the most efficient route to getting needed water, but in the long term can cause conflict if water is [[Overdrafting|overdrafted]].

More than 50 countries on five continents are said to be at risk of conflict over water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/natres/waterindex.htm|title=Water in Conflict|first=James Paul – Global Policy|last=Forum|website=www.globalpolicy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intra-national competition==

===Australia===
{{Main article|Water security in Australia}}

In [[Australia]] there is competition for the resources of the Darling River system between [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]].

In [[Victoria, Australia]] a proposed pipeline from the [[Goulburn Valley]] to [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] has led to protests by farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23069045-5010020,00.html|title=Herald Sun|website=Herald Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Macquarie Marshes]] of NSW [[grazing]] and [[irrigation]] interests compete for water flowing to the marshes

The [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]] diverted water from the [[Snowy River]] to the [[Murray River]] and the [[Murrumbidgee River]] for the benefit of irrigators and [[electricity]] generation through [[hydro-electric power]]. During recent years government has taken action to increase [[environmental flows]] to the Snowy in spite of severe drought in the [[Murray Darling Basin]]. The Australian Government has implemented buy-backs of water allocations, or properties with water allocations, to endeavour to increase environmental flows.

In India, there is competition for water resources of all inter state rivers except the main [[Brahmaputra river]] among the riparian states of India and also with neighbouring countries which are Nepal, China, Pakistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/06/25/000333037_20080625020800/Rendered/PDF/443760PUB0IN0W1Box0327398B01PUBLIC1.pdf |title=India’s water economy bracing for a turbulent future, World Bank report, 2006|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vast area of the [[Indian subcontinent]] is under tropical climate which is conducive for agriculture due to favourable warm and sunny conditions provided perennial water supply is available to cater to the high rate of [[evapotranspiration]] from the cultivated land. Though the overall water resources are adequate to meet all the requirements of the subcontinent, the water supply gaps due to temporal and spatial distribution of water resources among the states and countries in the subcontinent are to be bridged.

There is [[Interstate River Water Disputes Act|intense competition for the water]] available in the inter state rivers such as [[Kaveri River water dispute|Kavery]], [[Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal|Krishna]], [[Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal|Godavari]], [[Vamsadhara River|Vamsadhara]], [[Mandovi River|Mandovi]], [[Ravi River|Ravi-Beas-Sutlez]], [[Narmada River|Narmada]], [[Tapti River|Tapti]], [[Mahanadi]], etc. among the riparian states of India in the absence of water augmentation from the water surplus rivers such as Brahmaputra, [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] tributaries of [[Ganges|Ganga]] and west flowing coastal rivers of [[western ghats]]. All river basins face severe water shortage even for drinking needs of people, cattle and wild life during the intense summer season when the rainfall is negligible.

Water security can be achieved along with [[energy security]] as it is going to consume electricity to link the surplus water areas with the water deficit areas by lift canals, pipe lines, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Lester R.

== United States domestic policy ==
The United States currently does not have a cohesive domestic water security policy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Tench, Rob. "Burch, John R., Jr.: Water Rights and the Environment in the United States: A Documentary and Reference Guide." ''Library Journal'', 15 Mar. 2016, p. 133+.&lt;/ref&gt; Water security is projected to be a problem in the future since future population growth will most likely occur in areas that are currently water stressed.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Ensuring that the United States remains water secure will require policies that will ensure fair distribution of existing water sources, protecting water sources from becoming depleted, maintaining good wastewater disposal, and maintaining existing water infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=David Z.|last2=Yang|first2=Y.

If limits are imposed, the people most impacted will be the largest water withdrawers from a water source. In 2005, 31% of US water use was for irrigation, 49% was [[Electricity generation|thermoelectric]] power, public supply 11%, public supply, industrial was 4%, aquaculture 2%, domestic 1%, and livestock less than 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1344/pdf/c1344.pdf|title=Estimated Use of Water in the United States in 2005|last=Kenny|first=Joan|date=2009|website=United States Geological Survey|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of current national water policy is effective in regions of the United States where there is a lot of water but not effective in regions of water scarcity. In the future, a national water security policy may have to be implemented to move water from regions that are water rich to regions that are water scarce. If new policies are implemented, the major stakeholders will be individual states (both water rich and water poor states), farmers, power companies, and other industries that use a substantial amount of water (such as mining and oil and gas).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Water utility security ===
According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), "Improving the security of our nation's [[drinking water]] and [[wastewater]] infrastructures has become a top priority since the events of [[9/11]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Copeland|first1=Claudia|title=Terrorism and Security Issues Facing the Water Infrastructure Sector |url=http://fas.org/sgp/crs/terror/RL32189.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=16 August 2014|date=December 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant actions are underway to assess and reduce vulnerabilities to potential [[terrorist attack]]s; to plan for and practice response to emergencies and incidents; and to develop new security technologies to detect and monitor [[contaminant]]s and prevent security breaches."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfpub.epa.gov/safewater/watersecurity/index.cfm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111081323/http://cfpub.epa.gov/safewater/watersecurity/index.cfm |date=January 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important elements of water security is early and accurate contamination detection.  The EPA has issued advisory material and guidelines for contamination warning systems to be implemented in water utilities and supplies.  The security challenges that utilities frequently revolve around fast detection, [[accuracy]], and the ability to take fast action when there is a water problem.  If contamination is detected early enough, it can be prevented from reaching [[consumer]]s, and emergency water supplies can be put into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.epa.gov/safewater/watersecurity/pubs/guide_watersecurity_securityinitiative_interimplanningpdf.pdf |title=Water Security Initiative: Interim Guidance on Planning for Contamination Warning System Deployment |publisher=US EPA |date= |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where contamination might still reach consumers, fast and efficient [[communication system]]s are necessary.  All these factors also point to the need for organized and practiced [[emergency procedure]]s and [[Emergency preparedness|preparedness]].

=== Regulation ===
Since 2002, under the [[Bioterrorism Act]], a [[water utility]] supplying more than 3,300 people must take at least the following measures to ensure security of the water supply:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/ucm148797.htm |title=Bioterrorism Act of 2002 |publisher=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://cfpub.epa.gov/safewater/watersecurity/home.cfm?program_id=11] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730155311/http://cfpub.epa.gov/safewater/watersecurity/home.cfm?program_id=11 |date=July 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IV -- Drinking Water Security and Safety|url=http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/ucm155780.htm|publisher=FDA|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Conduct an assessment of the facility’s vulnerabilities to [[vandalism]], insider [[sabotage]], or terrorist attack, and submit the report to the EPA.
* Show that the facility has an up-to-date [[emergency response]] plan, should an incident occur.

More recently, under the Drinking Water Security Act of 2009, the EPA is now required to establish risk-based performance standards for community water systems serving more than 3,300 people.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

[[Cincinnati]] Water Works, [[San Francisco]], and [[New York City]] are among the major water utilities that have taken water security measures at their facilities, such as planning for contamination warning systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=staff |url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/feb2009/2009-02-24-091.asp |title=EPA Invests $2 Million in Philadelphia Drinking Water Security |publisher=Ens-newswire.com |date=2009-02-23 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water utility security components ===
Security of a water supply involves a range of elements.  Prevention and detection systems include some or all of the following: access to [[public health]] and customer complaint data, [[water quality]] monitoring equipment, sampling and analysis, cyber-security which includes situation management and IT systems hardware and software, and physical security.  [[Crisis management]] and recovery, for when critical water events occur, includes flow control and security valves, rapid and effective communication systems, and emergency water supply equipment.

Specific technologies involved in water security are [[SCADA]], GIS ([[geographic information system]]), online (real-time) [[water quality]] monitoring devices, contamination warning systems, intrusion detection systems (IDS), contamination detection devices, security valves, security cameras and fences, situation management/[[emergency management software]], emergency supply tanks, manned  (or human) security personnel, personal [[Water purification|purification]] devices, and [[counter-terrorism]] intelligence.

=== Notable water security organizations ===
The Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center (WaterISAC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterisac.org|title=WaterISAC|website=www.waterisac.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the US water sector's security and emergency response information source.  This nonprofit service provides US, Canadian, and Australian drinking water and wastewater utilities with the information they need to heighten the protection of water collection and delivery infrastructure.  WaterISAC is also a peer-to-peer, business networking platform. Eligible members of the water sector have access to a clearinghouse of government and private documents, guides, best practices, handbooks, and contaminant databases as well as shared data including analysis of successful and failed security incidents within the water sector.  These include cyber incidents, physical incidents, and other security related incidents. Many but not all of these are reported to and tracked by WaterISAC. Together, these resources are can be used by utility managers to identify risks, prepare for emergencies, and secure the nation's critical water [[infrastructure]] and the [[Natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://portal.waterisac.org/web/aboutus.jspa |title=About Us &amp;#124; WaterISAC |publisher=Portal.waterisac.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[American Water Works Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awwa.org|title=AWWA Home|first=American Water Works|last=Association|website=www.awwa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blue Peace==
[[File:US Navy 091231-N-1572M-001 Seabees tap new water well.jpg|thumb|right|US Navy Seabees tapping an [[artesian well]] in [[Helmand Province]], Afghanistan]]
Blue Peace is a method which seeks to transforms trans-boundary water issues into instruments for cooperation. This unique approach to turn tensions around water into opportunities for socio-economic development was developed by [[Strategic Foresight Group]] in partnership with the Governments of Switzerland and Sweden.

{{quote|"The Blue Peace is an innovative approach to engage political leaders, diplomats and populations in harnessing and managing collaborative solutions for sustainable water management."|Foreign Minister Didier Burkhalter of Swirtzerland, speaking at the UN General Assembly}}Blue Peace is part of a larger trend of viewing water as a [[Human rights|human right]] rather than a [[Commodity|market commodity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conca|first=K.|title=The United States and International Water Policy|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.proxy.library.cmu.edu/doi/abs/10.1177/1070496508319862|journal=The Journal of Environment &amp; Development|volume=17|issue=3|pages=215–237|doi=10.1177/1070496508319862|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When water is viewed as a human right, it [[Empowerment|empowers]] people in water stressed areas to manage their water sources effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking water management : innovative approaches to contemporary issues|last=Figueres|first=Caroline|publisher=Earthscan Publications|year=2003|isbn=|location=London ; Sterling, VA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of having effective management of water is ensuring that all [[Socio-economic group|socioeconomic groups]] of people in a region have adequate access to water, not just certain people.

A January 17, 2008, article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' states, "World-wide, 13,080 desalination plants produce more than 12 billion gallons of water a day, according to the International Desalination Association." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120053698876396483?mod=googlenews_wsj Water, Water, Everywhere...], The Wall. St Journal, January 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's largest desalination plant is the [[Jebel Ali]] Desalination Plant (Phase 2) in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. It is a dual-purpose facility that uses multi-stage flash distillation and is capable of producing 300 million cubic meters of water per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwater.org/data20062007/Table21.pdf |title=100 Largest Desalination Plants Planned, in Construction, or in Operation—January 1, 2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical [[aircraft carrier]] in the U.S. military uses nuclear power to desalinize {{convert|400,000|USgal|L}} of water per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Tom |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/aircraft-carrier2.htm |title=How Aircraft Carriers Work |publisher=Science.howstuffworks.com |date=2002-08-29 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While desalinizing {{convert|1,000|USgal|L}} of water can cost as much as $3, the same amount of [[bottled water]] costs $7,945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryindex.com/pages/2644/Arid-West-Where-Water-Scarce-DESALINATION-GROWING-WATERSUPPLY-SOURCE.html The Arid West—Where Water Is Scarce - Desalination—a Growing Watersupply Source], Library Index&lt;/ref&gt;

However, given the energy intensive nature of desalination, with associated economic and environmental costs, desalination is generally considered a last resort after [[water conservation]]. But this is changing as prices continue to fall.

According to [[MSNBC]], a report by Lux Research estimated that the worldwide desalinated water supply will triple between 2008 and 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29735521/ A Rising Tide for New Desalinated Water Technologies], MSNBC, March. 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not everyone is convinced that desalination is or will be economically viable or environmentally sustainable for the foreseeable future. [[Debbie Cook]], the former mayor of [[Huntington Beach, California]], has been a frequent critic of desalination proposals ever since she was appointed as a member of the California Desalination Task Force. Cook claims that in addition to being energy intensive, desalination schemes are very costly—often much more costly than desalination proponents claim. In her writing on the subject, Cook points to a long list of projects that have stalled or been aborted for financial or other reasons, and suggests that water-stressed regions would do better to focus on conservation or other water supply solutions than to invest in desalination plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/01/17/desalination-unlocking-lessons-from-yesterdays-solution-part-1/ Desalination: Unlocking Lessons from Yesterday’s Solution (part 1)], Water Matters, January 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar energy based desalination==
A novel approach to desalination is the [[seawater greenhouse]], which takes seawater and uses solar energy to desalinate it in conjunction with growing food crops in a specially adapted greenhouse.

==Food security with tiny water foot print==
{{Main|Food versus fuel|Power-to-gas}}
It is feasible to divert most of the available fresh water resources for drinking, industrial, hydro power and adequate environmental river flows purposes by reducing water use in agriculture which is consuming more than 80% of the global fresh water use. Without cultivating water intense crops, global [[food security]] can be achieved at faster pace by producing protein rich feed for cattle, poultry and fish from the cultivation of ''[[Methylococcus capsulatus]]'' bacteria culture with tiny land and water foot print using [[natural gas]] / [[biogas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2112298-food-made-from-natural-gas-will-soon-feed-farm-animals-and-us/ |title=Food made from natural gas will soon feed farm animals – and us |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carbontrust.com/media/672719/calysta-feedkind.pdf |title=Assessment of environmental impact of FeedKind protein |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntva.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/04-huslid.pdf |title=BioProtein Production |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cargill.com/2016/new-venture-selects-cargill-tennessee-to-produce-feedkind |title=New venture selects Cargill’s Tennessee site to produce Calysta FeedKind® Protein |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
