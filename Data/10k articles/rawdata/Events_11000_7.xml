The '''01SJ Biennial''' is a multi-disciplinary, multi-venue event of visual and performing arts, the moving image, public art, and interactive digital media held biannually in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]], curated by [[ZER01]]'s artistic director Steve Dietz.

==History==
The inaugural Biennial took place in 2006 in conjunction with the 13th [[Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts|International Symposium on Electronic Art (ISEA)]]. It drew upwards of 20,000 attendees from around the globe and contributed $6 million to the local economy. The second 01SJ Biennial in 2008 drew 45,000 attendees, generated $9 million in [[revenue]] for the local economy, and established the Biennial as a significant new festival of contemporary art.

The Biennial's primary venues are located in downtown San Jose but with each subsequent Biennial more satellite projects and parallel programs have been added in cities throughout [[Silicon Valley]].

The 2010 01SJ Biennial occurred September 16–19, 2010 and is themed "Build Your Own World", which posits that the future is not about what's next; it's about what we can build to ensure that what's next matters.

The '''Boys in Red accident'''{{ref|ref1|[a]}} was a January 12, 2008 collision just outside the city of [[Bathurst, New Brunswick]], [[Canada]], between a [[semi-trailer truck]] and a van carrying the [[basketball]] team from [[Bathurst High School (Bathurst, New Brunswick)|Bathurst High School]]. The accident killed seven students and the wife of the coach, and injured four other occupants in the van.&lt;ref name="BIRexpla"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the deadliest bus accident involving a sports team in Canada until the [[Humboldt Broncos bus crash]] in April 2018.

The accident was followed by a national [[day of mourning]] in Canada, and a ban on all E350 [[Ford Club Wagon]] type vehicles being used for [[student transport]] in New Brunswick. Two investigations, one by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) and the other by [[Transport Canada]], found that the cause of the disaster was a combination of poor road conditions, lack of proper snow tires, and possible driver error. Pressure from the public and victims' families prompted the chief coroner of the province to launch an inquiry, which produced recommendations to improve student transport safety in New Brunswick. The provincial government agreed with the majority of the suggestions and has since enacted many of them.

== Accident ==
The accident occurred on [[New Brunswick Route 8]] shortly after midnight on January 12, 2008, when the team coach was driving the Bathurst High School basketball team northward back from a game in [[Moncton]] against the Moncton High School Purple Knights in an E350 [[Ford Club Wagon]]. Light [[freezing rain]] and low visibility created poor, slippery driving conditions. As the van approached the Bathurst [[city limits]], the coach lost control and veered in front of a southbound semi-trailer truck. The truck collided with the side of the van and the two vehicles came to rest on the [[shoulder (road)|shoulder]] of the southbound lane of the highway approximately {{convert|40|m|ft}} from the point of impact.&lt;ref name="TransportCanadaReport"&gt;{{cite web |title=Special Investigation V ASF5-1210 1997 Ford E 350 Super Club XLT Van Vs. 2005 Mack CXN613 "Vision" tractor towing a 2007 Great Dane Super LT reefer semitrailer |publisher=Transport Canada Road Safety|url=http://www.cbc.ca/nb/media/pdf/transport_canada_report.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC0112"&gt;{{cite news

The police officer who discovered the wreck initially suspected that only the semi had gone off the road. After further investigation, he found the van and called for emergency services, whose arrival was delayed by freezing rain. The rear wall and a large portion of the right-hand side of the van, including three rows of [[Car seat|seats]], had been torn away, ejecting several occupants.&lt;ref name="TransportCanadaReport"/&gt; Seven players and the wife of the team coach were pronounced dead at the scene. The coach, his daughter and the two other players survived the accident and were rushed to [[Chaleur Regional Hospital]] in Bathurst. Of the injured, one was listed in critical condition, and two in stable. The fourth was released shortly after the accident. The driver of the truck was not injured.&lt;ref name="CTVK8I7"&gt;{{cite news

== Reaction ==
The accident was met with grief and condolences from New Brunswick and around Canada.

John McLaughlin, [[New Brunswick School District 15|School District 15]] Superintendent, stated that the community of Bathurst was in a state of shock and mourning. McLaughlin also noted that the coach held the appropriate license to drive the vehicle and that there were no laws or regulations in the province which regulated team transportation in the event of poor weather. He also added: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;That's really hard because you have to gauge the weather each time you have to make a decision. As for what happened last night, I can't comment. I don't have that information. But in general, our people take great care in making decisions based on the information that they have at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On January 16, all sports-related [[Extracurricular activity|extracurricular activities]] in New Brunswick were cancelled. Services were held across the country. Some schools asked students to wear red and black, the colours of Bathurst High School. The funeral for the seven deceased players was held in Bathurst at the [[K. C. Irving Regional Centre]], which was filled with 6,000 people. An additional 3,500 mourners filled the adjacent rink to watch the service on a widescreen television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Investigation ==

Both the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) and [[Transport Canada]] conducted investigations into the accident. The RCMP released its report on July 29, 2008. The report stated that the van would not have passed a safety inspection at the time of the accident because of [[rust]] in its body, worn [[Tire#All season|all-season tires]], and faulty brakes. None of these factors could be identified as the sole cause of the accident, but the report noted that "together, they certainly contributed".&lt;ref name=RCMP_rpt/&gt; The report added that speed was not a factor in the crash, as the van was only travelling about {{convert|73|km/h|mph}} and the truck at approximately {{convert|80|km/h|mph}} at the time of impact, both of which were well below the posted limit of {{convert|100|km/h|mph}}. The van had been inspected on October 29, 2007, just over two months prior to the collision, and was four months away from its next inspection. The report resulted in public questioning of New Brunswick's motor vehicle inspection program.&lt;ref name=RCMP_rpt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | publisher = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date = 2008-07-29
 | accessdate = 2008-10-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transport Canada released its report on July 30, 2008. It blamed weather conditions, but also focused on driver fatigue and driver error. It cited several breaches of provincial law regarding the operation of commercial vehicles. The coach had been on duty for sixteen hours when the collision happened, contravening the law that one cannot drive if they have been working more than fourteen consecutive hours. The report also identified inadequate pre-trip inspections and log book keeping, and the lack of a [[contingency plan]] in the event of poor weather.&lt;ref name="TransportCanadaReport"/&gt; Transport Canada stated that although they put an added emphasis on some factors, their report was consistent with the RCMP's. They concurred that the vehicle would have failed an inspection in its pre-collision state because of worn tires and brakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Six of the dead were not wearing [[seat belt]]s, while a seventh was not properly restrained. Greg Sypher, a collision analyst and principal [[Transport Canada]] investigator, later suggested that seat belts most likely would not have saved all the victims' lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Aftermath ==

[[File:'97-'02 Ford E-Series Van LWB.JPG|thumb|250px|right|alt=Black van parked in a parking lot|Ford E350 van similar to the one involved in the accident, only of different color.]] Following the accident New Brunswick immediately halted the use of 15-passenger vans and began a thorough review of transportation policy; many other provinces later did the same. At the time of the tragedy only [[Nova Scotia]] had a ban on 15-passenger vans, following an accident in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Recommendations ===

On August 26, 2008, a government working group presented New Brunswick Education Minister [[Kelly Lamrock]] with eight recommendations for extracurricular transportation. The recommendations included that guidelines for transporting students to school-related extracurricular activities be strengthened, that a [[school bus]] be used when transporting ten or more students, that vehicles be equipped with snow tires if travelling between October 15 and April 30, and that the district superintendent be charged with responsibility for ensuring safe transportation of students to and from extracurricular activities. Lamrock initially suggested that schools voluntarily follow the recommendations, though they were later made into enforceable policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | work = [[Telegraph-Journal]] | date = 2008-11-13

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major effect of the recommendations is that, as of November 2008, it is mandatory that all vehicle operators who intend to use their vehicles to transport students between extracurricular activities be covered by a [[Liability insurance|Third Party Liability]] and Accident Benefit policy. These policies must be in the amount of no less than [[CAD$]]1 million for vehicles with a capacity of fewer than 10 passengers, and no less than CAD$5 million for vehicles with a capacity of 10 or more. This also applies to parents driving others' children to school related extracurricular activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guideline 513 Student Activity Vehicles |publisher=New Brunswick Department of Education|url=http://www.gnb.ca/0000/pol/e/513a.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=2008-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes were met with critical reception in the province. Many students are now required to pay higher sports fees to cover higher transportation costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools do not have access to approved vehicles because the ''Education Act'' prohibits schools and [[school district]]s from owning vehicles. To get around this they use corporate entities to operate vehicles for extracurricular activities. These require money to buy new vehicles and the required [[insurance]], which often requires schools to conduct extra [[fundraising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Responsibility ===

On November 12, 2008, the RCMP ruled out laying criminal charges in relation to the accident. It stated that the finding had been reviewed by a [[Crown attorney|Crown prosecutor]] and that no wrongdoing was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The families of two of the deceased expressed disapproval of the decision and indicated that they may bring a lawsuit against several of the involved parties, though others have publicly stated that they accepted the decision. The chief [[coroner]] of the province stated that a provincial [[inquest]] was possible, though it would take some time to come to any decision on the matter. No decision on whether or not to have an inquest was made for over a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Two families accused the Department of Public Safety of "dragging its feet". These families stated that they wanted a "Van Angels" law that would require any driver taking students outside of their community to possess a Class 2 driver's license. They also wanted a weather law that would prevent students from travelling outside of their communities during [[severe weather]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On December 17, 2008, Greg Forestell, the province's acting chief coroner, called for an inquiry into the accident, stating that  "[t]he inquest gives us the opportunity to pull all those facts together in a comprehensive manner and look at the issues in their entirety and have the [[jury]] make recommendations for prevention."&lt;ref name=Bathinqucall&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inquest began on May 4, 2009 and lasted until May 14.  It included testimony from survivors, experts, and provincial officials. The inquest did not blame anyone directly for the accident, but the jury returned 24 recommendations. Kelly Lamrock stated that the province intended to implement the "vast majority" of these recommendations and that a third of them had already been initiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Atlantic Wholesalers Limited and Loblaws lawsuit ===

On December 22, 2009 [[Atlantic Wholesalers|Atlantic Wholesalers Limited]] and [[Loblaws]] filed a joint claim against the coach and Bathurst Van Inc. In the lawsuit the plaintiffs complained that negligence on behalf of the defendants was responsible for the crash. Atlantic Wholesalers and Loblaws argue that they are owed $40,667.86 in damages, and an additional $847.50 to cover the clean-up costs. After extensive press coverage and public backlash, Atlantic Wholesalers and Loblaws attempted to defend their action stating that this action was "normal insurance procedures follow an accident of this nature". Public outrage spread and on January 8, 2010, Loblaws dropped the suit for unspecified reasons after enormous public backlash with numerous persons calling for a boycott of the chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Memorial ==
A memorial for the victims was unveiled on June 6, 2008, at Bathurst High School. An archway with a basketball net was placed in a courtyard behind the school. The memorial was funded by donations. 

A temporary memorial at the crash site consisting of two basketball nets and flowers was also erected, and one of the nets featuring pictures of the players remained there as of September 2018. 

A permanent "Boys in Red" memorial for the victims of the van crash has been erected on an empty lot on King Avenue in the city's downtown area near the Bathurst High School. The memorial was erected in a small walking park near the school. It consists of seven vertical columns of red quartz. The site has been used for a memorial space in the past as 2 small stones with plaques are placed by the st john st sidewalks of the park with 2 small trees erected as a memorial of 2 Bathurst High students who were among the class of 2001 who died in automobile accidents as well a few months before graduation.

'''''Agos''''' (in {{lang-hy|[[wikt:ակօս|Ակօս]]}}, "[[furrow]]"; in {{lang-gr|[[wikt:ἄγος|ἄγος]]}},  "abomination") is an [[Armenians|Armenian]] bilingual weekly newspaper published in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], established on 5 April 1996.

''Agos'' has both [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] pages as well as an online [[English language|English]] edition. Today, the paper  has a weekly circulation of over 9,000. 

==History==
Turkish-Armenian [[Hrant Dink]] was ''Agos'' chief editor from the newspaper's beginnings until his assassination outside the newspaper's offices in Istanbul in January 2007.

Hrant Dink's son, [[Arat Dink]], who served as the executive editor of the weekly, had been co-defendant in the cases brought against Hrant Dink for [[Article 301 (Turkish penal code)|"denigrating Turkishness"]] on account of his managerial position at the weekly.

After [[Hrant Dink assassination|Hrant Dink's assassination]], [[Etyen Mahçupyan]] was named editor-in-chief. In 2010, he was succeeded in that position by [[Rober Koptaş]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Vercihan Ziflioğlu |title=Young editor to take helm of Turkish-Armenian weekly |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=young-editor-in-chief-to-weekly-agos-2010-06-17 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |date=17 June 2010 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arat Dink continued to serve as executive editor. 

In 2015, [[Yetvart Danzikyan]] became editor-in-chief of the newspaper and [[Aris Nalcı]] executive editor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bianet.org/bianet/medya/161894-agos-ta-yetvart-danzikyan-donemi Bianet: Agos'ta Yetvart Danzikyan Dönemi] {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baltic Tiger''' is a term used to refer to any of the three [[Baltic states]] of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] during their periods of [[economic boom]], which started after the year 2000 and continued until 2006–2007. The term is modeled on [[Four Asian Tigers]], [[Tatra Tiger]] and [[Celtic Tiger]], which were used to describe the economic boom periods in parts of [[Asia]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], respectively.

==Overview==
After 2000, the Baltic Tiger economies implemented important economic reforms and liberalisation, which, coupled with their fairly low-wage and skilled labour force, attracted large amounts of foreign investment and economic growth. Between 2000 and 2007, the Baltic Tiger states had the highest growth rates in [[Europe]]. In 2006, for example, [[Estonia]] grew by 10.3% in [[gross domestic product]], while Latvia grew by 11.9% and Lithuania by 7.5%. All three countries by February 2006 saw their rates of unemployment falling below average EU values. Additionally, Estonia is among the ten most liberal economies in the world{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} and in 2006 switched from being classified as an upper-middle income economy to a high-income economy by the World Bank. All three countries joined the [[European Union]] in May 2004. Estonia adopted the [[Euro]] in January 2011, Latvia in 2014 and Lithuania entered the [[Eurozone]] in 2015.

In 2008, the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|global financial crisis]] triggered the collapse of the Baltic property markets, causing some of the most severe recessions in Europe. In 2008, Latvia's GDP shrank by −4.6% and Estonia's −3.6% while Lithuania's slowed to 3.0%. As the crisis swept across Eastern and Central Europe the economic reversal intensified: [[Estonia]]'s GDP dropped by -16.2% year-on-year, Latvia’s by −19.6% and Lithuania’s by −16.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a8U0aGhDyw68 | work=Bloomberg | title=Latvia's Economy Contracted Record 19.6% Last Quarter (Update3) | date=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-2009, all three countries experienced one of the deepest recessions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20091116/rizga |title=November 16, 2009 |publisher=The Nation |date= |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010 the economic situation in the Baltic states stabilized and in 2011 the Baltic states experienced the fastest recoveries in the European Union, after having lost a substantial part of their populations through emigration, particularly Lithuania. Estonia's GDP grew by 8.3% in 2011, Lithuania's GDP grew by 5.9% and  Latvia's GDP by 5.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/analytics/?doc=54355 | work= The Baltic Course | title=GDP of Latvia increased by 5.5% in 2011| date= 2012-03-09 | accessdate=2012-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal law}}
'''Blackmail''' is an act of [[coercion]] using the [[threat]] of revealing or publicizing either [[Substantial truth|substantially true]] or false, and often damaging, information about a person, to the public, family members, or associates unless certain demands are met. It may involve using threats of physical, mental or emotional harm, or of criminal prosecution, against the victim or someone or close to the victim.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster"&gt;{{cite book | title = Merriam-Webster's dictionary of law |publisher= Merriam-Webster|year=1996|page=53|accessdate=23 May 2011| ISBN = 978-0-87779-604-6| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYs74quLWLIC&amp;pg=PA53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="American Heritage"&gt;{{cite book | title = The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, 4th edition |year=2010|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company.|ISBN =}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is normally carried out for personal gain, most commonly of position, money, or property.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster"/&gt;&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackmail|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=23 May 2011|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blackmail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burton"&gt;{{cite book | title = Burton's Legal Thesaurus|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2006|page=233|accessdate=23 May 2011| ISBN =978-0-07-147262-3| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9OGU6qOu_3YC&amp;pg=PA233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;{{cite book | title = The encyclopedia of American law enforcement|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2007|page=78|accessdate=23 May 2011|ISBN =978-0-8160-6290-4| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PPu3GVnde-QC&amp;pg=PA78}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Blackmail may also be considered a form of [[extortion]].&lt;ref name="merriam-webster"/&gt; Although the two are generally synonymous, extortion is the taking of personal property by threat of future harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank Schmalleger |author2=Daniel E.

Dolatowski |title=Criminal Law Today|year=2009|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-504261-5|pages=271–272|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackmail is the use of threat to prevent another from engaging in a lawful occupation and writing libelous letters or letters that provoke a breach of the peace, as well as use of intimidation for purposes of collecting an unpaid debt.&lt;ref name="West"/&gt;

In many jurisdictions, blackmail is a statutory offense, often criminal, carrying punitive sanctions for convicted perpetrators. Blackmail is the name of a [[statutory]] offense in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;cond=ALL;doc_id=69%252B%252B1924%252BJS1%2540GS241%2540EN%252B20160127140000;histon=;prompt=;rec=;term=blackmail|title=Legislation View Page|website=www.thelaw.tas.gov.au|access-date=2016-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919150550/http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;cond=ALL;doc_id=69%252B%252B1924%252BJS1%2540GS241%2540EN%252B20160127140000;histon=;prompt=;rec=;term=blackmail|archive-date=19 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used as a convenient way of referring to certain other offenses, but was not a term used in [[Law of England and Wales|English law]] until 1968.&lt;ref name="Griew, Edward page 183"&gt;Griew, Edward.

Blackmail originally meant payments rendered by settlers in the counties of England bordering [[Scotland]] to chieftains  in exchange for protection from Scottish thieves and marauders.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West"&gt;{{cite book | title = West's encyclopedia of American law, Volume 2|publisher=West Pub. Co.|year=1998|pages=569 pages|accessdate=23 May 2011|ISBN =978-0-314-20155-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7-lGAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "mail" part of blackmail derives from Middle English ''male'' meaning "rent or tribute".&lt;ref name="Daily Writing Tips"&gt;{{cite web | author = Maeve Maddox | title = The Difference Between Extortion and Blackmail | accessdate=18 Jul 2011| url=http://www.dailywritingtips.com/extortion-and-blackmail/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tribute (male or ''reditus'') was paid in goods or labour ("nigri"); hence ''reditus nigri'', or "blackmail". Alternatively, it may be derived from two [[Scottish Gaelic]] words ''blathaich'' - to protect; and ''mal'' - tribute or payment. 

==Etymology==
The word blackmail is variously derived from the word for [[tribute]] (in modern terms, [[protection racket]]) paid by English and Scottish border dwellers to [[Border Reivers]] in return for immunity from raids and other harassment. The "mail" part of blackmail derives from [[Middle English]] ''male'', "rent, tribute".&lt;ref name="Daily Writing Tips"&gt;{{cite web | author = Maeve Maddox | title = The Difference Between Extortion and Blackmail | accessdate=18 Jul 2011| url=http://www.dailywritingtips.com/extortion-and-blackmail/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tribute was paid in goods or labour (''reditus nigri'', or "blackmail"); the opposite is ''blanche firmes'' or ''reditus albi'', or "white rent" (denoting payment by silver). Alternatively, Mckay derives it from two [[Scottish Gaelic]] words ''blathaich'' pronounced (the th silent) bla-ich (to protect) and ''mal'' (tribute, payment). He notes that the practice was common in the [[Scottish Highlands]] as well as the [[Scottish Marches|Borders]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Mckay, ''Dictionary of Lowland Scots'', 1888 (archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Irish Gaelic]], the term ''cíos dubh'', meaning "black-rent" has also been employed.

==Laws by country==

===Australia===

====Victoria====
The offence of blackmail is created by section 87&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ca195882/s87.html|title=CRIMES ACT 1958 - SECT 87 Blackmail|publisher=austlii.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Crimes Act 1958]].

Sections 87(1) and (2) are derived from and identical to sections 21(1) and (2) of the Theft Act 1968 printed above.

Section 87(3) provides that a person guilty of blackmail is guilty of an [[indictable offence]] and liable to level 4 imprisonment (15 years maximum).

====South Australia====
The offence of blackmail is created by Part 6B Section 172&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/clca1935262/s172.html|title=CRIMINAL LAW CONSOLIDATION ACT 1935 - SECT 172|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935.

Section 172 provides that a person who menaces another intending to get the other to submit to a demand is guilty of blackmail, and may be subject to imprisonment (a maximum of 15 years for a basic offence or a maximum of 20 year for an aggravated offence).

===Republic of Ireland===

The offence created by section 17(1)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0002/sec0017.html|title=Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, Section 17|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994]] is described by the marginal note to that section as "blackmail, extortion and demanding money with menaces". The offence is derived from the offence under section 21 of the Theft Act 1968.

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
In [[England and Wales]] this offence is created by section 21(1) of the [[Theft Act 1968]]. Sections 21(1) and (2) of that Act provide:

{{blockquote|(1) A person is guilty of blackmail if, with a view to gain for himself or another or with intent to cause loss to another, he makes any unwarranted demand with menaces; and for this purpose a demand with menaces is unwarranted unless the person making it does so in the belief:
::(a) that he has reasonable grounds for making the demand; and
::(b) that the use of the menaces is a proper means of reinforcing the demand.

(2) The nature of the act or omission demanded is immaterial, and it is also immaterial whether the menaces relate to action to be taken by the person making the demand.}}

=====Construction=====

The Theft Act 1968 section 21 contains the present-day definition of blackmail in English law. It requires four elements:

# There must be a "demand".
# The demand must also have been accompanied or reinforced (at the time or later) by a "menace". Broadly, a menace is any threat, or implied consequence or action, which would coerce or pressure an unwilling person to accede (give in) to the demand.
# The making of a "demand with menace(s)" must have been "unwarranted". Broadly, a demand with menace is ''always'' unwarranted unless both the making of the demand was reasonably justified, '''and''' its reinforcement with the "menace" was proper, in the belief of the perpetrator.
# There must have been an intention by the perpetrator to make a gain for himself/herself or someone else, or to cause a loss to someone.

Therefore the requirement for this offence may be paraphrased as:
# A person makes a demand of someone else, which is accompanied or reinforced in some way by some consequence if they don't comply, which would coerce an unwilling victim to do what is demanded,&lt;br/&gt;'''and'''
# The intent is to make a gain (for themselves or anyone else) or cause a loss (to anyone),
# '''and either'''&lt;br/&gt;(a) The perpetrator did not truly believe that the demand was based on reasonable grounds&lt;br/&gt;'''or'''&lt;br/&gt;(b) The perpetrator did not truly believe that the menace was a proper way to reinforce the demand.&lt;br/&gt;'''(or both)'''

The law considers a "demand with menaces" to always be "unwarranted" (unjustified), unless the perpetrator '''actually believed''' that his/her demand had reasonable grounds, '''and also actually believed''' that the menace was a proper way to reinforce that demand. These tests relate to the actual belief of the perpetrator, not the belief of an ordinary or reasonable person. Therefore tests related to what a "reasonable" person might think, and tests of dishonesty, are not often relevant - the matter hinges upon the actual and honest beliefs and knowledge of the perpetrator him/herself. The wording of the Act means that there is a [[presumption (law)|presumption]] in law that demands and/or menaces are likely to be deemed unwarranted, unless the perpetrator shows evidence that they were believed not to be.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence and Pomeroy, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; However, once a perpetrator has defended him/herself by giving evidence related to the demand and menace both being believed warranted, the prosecution must overturn one or both of these claims to prove their case. The usual rule is that a criminal act, or a belief not truly held, can never be "warranted", although according to some authors, a "grey area" may (rarely) exist where a very minor illegality may be honestly believed to be warranted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nijnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA465&amp;lpg=PA465&amp;ots=JvLp6q7rXi&amp;sig=Hmm-pB2PXtFkhOzqFR3S7bQ0x8E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilrqGRsdPbAhUlKcAKHUF2D1YQ6AEIOzAC#v=onepage|title=Card, Cross and Jones Criminal Law|first1=Richard|last1=Card|first2=Rupert|last2=Cross|first3=Philip Asterley|last3=Jones|date=3 August 2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Additionally, a statement that would not usually coerce or pressure someone, may still be a "menace", if the perpetrator knew, believed, or expected that their specific victim would feel coerced or pressured by it. The law does not require a demand or menace be received by the victim, merely that they are made, therefore it is irrelevant whether the victim was affected or not, or even unaware of them (perhaps because they had not yet been received, read or listened to). Because the criteria include an intention to "cause" some kind of gain or loss, a demand for sex (for example) would not be considered blackmail, so threats with these and other demands are dealt with under a variety of other criminal laws. However even in these cases, a gain or loss of ''some'' kind can often be found, and then this law can then be applied.

In some cases, the perpetrator him/herself may claim to have acted under [[duress]]. The courts have ruled that a person who places themselves in a situation where they may be coerced to make a demand with menaces against a third party is likely, foreseeable, or probable, may not be able to rely on coercion as a defence, because they voluntarily placed themselves in such a situation. This issue has arisen, for example, in [[gang violence|gang-related violence]].&lt;ref&gt;R. v Hasan 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R v Fitzpatrick (1977) NI 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R v Sharp (1987) QB 853&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R v Shepherd (1987) 86 Cr. App R 47&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Menaces=====
The word "menaces" was adopted from sections 29(1)(i) and 30 of the [[Larceny Act 1916]]. Section 29(1)(i) made it felony for a person to utter, knowing the contents thereof, any letter or writing demanding of any person with menaces, and without any reasonable or probable cause, any property or valuable thing. Section 30 made it an offence for a person to, with menaces or by force, demand of any person anything capable of being stolen with intent to steal the same.

''Thorne v Motor Trade Association'' (1937)&lt;ref&gt;[1937] AC 797, [1937] [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 157, 26 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 51, HL&lt;/ref&gt;  is a [[leading case]] on the meaning of the word "menaces", decided under section 29(1)(i) of the [[Larceny Act 1916]].&lt;ref name="Griew, Edward page 189"&gt;Griew, Edward. ''The Theft Acts 1968 &amp; 1978'', Sweet &amp; Maxwell: London. Fifth Edition, paperback, {{ISBN|0-421-35310-4}}, paragraph 12–16 at page 189&lt;/ref&gt; The issue to be decided was whether the statement by a powerful trade association that a person found guilty of breaking their rules on [[price fixing]] would be "[[blacklist]]ed", but could avoid this fate by paying a fine, was an "menace". It was held that the trade body had both the right to put persons on their blacklist, and also the right to offer a fine as an alternative to being put on a blacklist, therefore neither of the demand or the menace were ruled to be "unwarranted". (The Court noted that a plainly ''unreasonable'' fine ''could'' potentially be viewed as unwarranted.) In this case, [[Robert Wright, Baron Wright|Lord Wright]] said:

{{Blockquote|I think the word "menace" is to be liberally construed and not as limited to threats of violence but as including threats of any action detrimental to or unpleasant to the person addressed. It may also include a warning that in certain events such action is intended.&lt;ref&gt;[1937] AC 797 at 817&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And [[Lord Atkin]] said:

{{Blockquote|The ordinary blackmailer normally threatens to do what he has a perfect right to do namely, communicate some compromising conduct to a person whose knowledge is likely to affect the person threatened. [...] What he has to justify is not the threat, but the demand of money.&lt;br/&gt;The [[gravamen]] of the charge is the demand without reasonable or probable cause: and I cannot think that the mere fact that the threat is to do something that a person is entitled to do either causes the threat not to be a "menace" [...] or in itself provides a reasonable or probable cause for the demand.&lt;ref&gt;[1937] AC 797 at 806 to 807&lt;/ref&gt;}}

R v Clear&lt;ref&gt;R v Clear [1968] 1 QB 670, [1968] 2 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 122, 132 JP 103, 112 [[Solicitors Journal|Sol Jo]] 67, [1968] 1 All ER 174, 52 Cr App R 58, CA&lt;/ref&gt; was decided under section 30 of the [[Larceny Act 1916]]. Sellers LJ said:&lt;ref&gt;R v Clear [1968] 1 QB 670 at 679 to 680, 52 Cr App R 58 at 69&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Blockquote|Words or conduct which would not intimidate or influence anyone to respond to the demand would not be menaces ... but threats and conduct of such a nature and such an extent that the mind of an ordinary person of normal stability and courage might be influenced or made apprehensive so as to accede unwilling to the demand would be sufficient for a jury's consideration.

and that:

There may be special circumstances unknown to the accused which would make the threats innocuous and unavailing for the accused's demand, but such circumstances would have no bearing on the accused's state of mind and of his intention. If an accused knew that what he threatened would have no effect on the victim it might be different.}}

In regard to the importance of the perpetrator's understanding of impact, in ''R. v Billy Joe (William) Temple'' (2008), the Court of Appeal reduced the perpetrator's original sentence, because it did not take into account, among other things, the appellant's lack of appreciation of the extreme nature of the impact of the menace to which he had been a party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/format.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2008/2511.html|title=Billy Joe (Aka William) Temple, R v [2008] EWCA Crim 2511 (16 October 2008)|author=|date=|website=www.bailii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In R v Lawrence and Pomroy,&lt;ref&gt;R v Lawrence and Pomroy (1971) 57 Cr App R 64, [1971] Crim LR 645, CA&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant argued that the direction given to the jury should have contained a definition of the word "menaces" in accordance with R v Clear. Cairn L.J. said:

{{blockquote|The word "menaces" is an ordinary English word which any jury can be expected to understand. In exceptional cases where because of special knowledge in special circumstances what would be a menace to an ordinary person is not a menace to the person to whom it is addressed, or where the converse may be true, it is no doubt necessary to spell out the meaning of the word.&lt;ref&gt;(1971) 57 Cr App R 64 at 72, CA&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In R v Lambert (2009), it was held that:

{{blockquote|[A] demand does not have to be made in terms of a demand or requirement or obligation. It can be couched in terms which are by no means aggressive or forceful. Indeed, the more suave and gentle the request, the more sinister in the circumstances it might be.&lt;ref name="lambert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/format.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2009/2860.html|title=Lambert, R. v [2009] EWCA Crim 2860 (15 October 2009)|first=|last=joe.ury|date=|website=www.bailii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The word "menaces" has been held to include the following:
*a threat to publish attacks on a company calculated to lower the value of its shares&lt;ref&gt;R v Boyle and Merchant [1914] 2 KB 339, 83 LJKB 1801, 111 LT 638, 30 TLR 521, 78 JP 390, 58 Sol Jo 673, 10 Cr App R 180, 24 Cox 406&lt;/ref&gt;
*a threat to reveal that the victim has not honoured a debt&lt;ref&gt;Norreys v Zefert [1939] 2 All ER 187, (1939) 83 Sol Jo 456&lt;/ref&gt;
*a threat to place the victim on a [[trade association]]'s "[[stop-list]]"&lt;ref&gt;Thorne v Motor Trade Association [1937] AC 797, HL&lt;/ref&gt; - although in that specific case, the menace was found not to be "unwarranted" because it was believed - and the court agreed - that it was justified and reasonable. The court commented that if the fine had been completely unreasonable, the menace might have become unwarranted as a result.
*a threat to refrain from giving evidence in an [[lawsuit|action]]&lt;ref&gt;R v Clear [1968] 1 QB 670&lt;/ref&gt;
*words such as "I'm not threatening you. I'm giving you a promise. Let's just leave it at that", or "I've not sent nobody to see you ''yet''"&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/format.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2015/1617.html|title=Ashiq, R v [2015] EWCA Crim 1617 (30 July 2015)|first=Lynn|last=Taylor|date=|website=www.bailii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*a person who phoned a relative posing as a victim of [[false imprisonment]], to say he was at risk of harm and needed money to pay off his captors and be freed. In this unusual case, although posing as victim and not threatening harm to the relative, the statement was capable of being a menace because of its coercive nature and the pressure it would apply on the victim, it was unwarranted, and there clearly was a demand. The ruling stated that ''"It is how the demand and menace affects the victim that matter"''.&lt;ref name="lambert" /&gt;

Professor Griew said that the word "menaces" could conceivably include:&lt;ref name="Griew, Edward page 189"/&gt;
*a threat of physical violence to the victim or another
*a threat of prosecution
*a threat to reveal actual criminal offending or sexual misbehaviour&lt;ref&gt;Presumably he intends this term to include [[adultery]]&lt;/ref&gt; or to publish false allegations of the same

David Ormerod said that it extends to a threat to damage property.&lt;ref&gt;Ormerod, David. Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law. Thirteenth Edition. Oxford University Press. 2011. p. 943.&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be remembered that the offence requires either an ''unwarranted'' menace, or an ''unwarranted'' demand, or both; not all menaces nor all demands are "unwarranted", and the belief of the perpetrator is the determining factor. If both the demand and the menace are each believed to be proper and reasonable to make, in law, then - depending upon the details of the case - the kinds of actions listed above may no longer be criminal offences. However as stated above, a criminal demand or menace can never believed to be "warranted", and actual knowledge of the victim and their state of mind or expected response may change a warranted matter into an unwarranted one.

=====Mode of trial and sentence=====
Blackmail is an [[indictable-only offence]]. A person convicted of blackmail is liable to imprisonment for any term not exceeding fourteen years.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Theft Act 1968]], section 21(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''R v Hadjou'' (1989),&lt;ref&gt;11 [[Criminal Appeal Reports (Sentencing)|Cr App R (S)]] 29, [1989] Crim LR 390&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Lane]] CJ said that blackmail is one of the ugliest and most vicious crimes because it often involves what he described as "attempted murder of the soul". He said that, perhaps because courts always impose severe sentences, one seldom finds a person convicted a second time of blackmail. He said that deterrence is perhaps the most important part of a sentence in a case of blackmail.

=====Related offences=====
Because blackmail can cover ''any'' unwarranted demand with a menace, many other offences may also be carried out as part of committing blackmail, or by the same events. For example:

:* An offence of [[robbery]] under section 8(1) of the [[Theft Act 1968]] may be committed, if a person puts or seeks to put another person in fear of being subjected to force if their demand is not met.

:*An offence under section 4 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]] might be committed if a person intended to cause another person to believe that immediate unlawful violence will be used against him (or someone else) or if the person threatened is likely to believe that such violence will be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/blackmail_commercial/|title=Blackmail Commercial: Sentencing Manual: Legal Guidance: The Crown Prosecution Service|work=cps.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* An offence under section 2 of the [[Criminal Damage Act 1971]] may be committed if there is a threat to destroy or damage property.

:* An offence under section 5 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] may be committed if a person  receives [[consideration (law)|consideration]] (broadly meaning: any gain or benefit) in exchange for agreeing not to report any "relevant" (previously: "arrestable") offence.

:* Several kinds of offence under Section 40 of the [[Administration of Justice Act 1970]] may be committed by [[debt collector]]s and other [[creditor]]s, if they make false and coercive statements in order to coerce [[debtor]]s to pay them money.&lt;ref&gt;Ormerod, David. Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law. Thirteenth Edition. Oxford University Press. 2011. p. 950. (The author included this offence in a chapter titled "blackmail and related offences").&lt;/ref&gt;

======Civil liability======
A blackmailer who threatens to publish a defamatory statement of and concerning an individual may be liable to be sued after the regulations of the Defamation Act 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/26/section/11/enacted|title=Defamation Act 2013|author=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Offenders of defamation may be taken to court if serious harm is done to the victim. The requirement for serious harm defines: &lt;br&gt;
(1) A statement is not defamatory unless its publication has caused or is likely to cause serious harm to the reputation of the claimant. &lt;br&gt;
(2) For the purposes of this section, harm to the reputation of a body that trades for profit is not "serious harm" unless it has caused or is likely to cause the body serious financial loss. &lt;br&gt;

The trial for the offence must be with a jury in the case of charges with cases of&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/54/section/69|title=Senior Courts Act 1981|author=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;: &lt;br&gt;
(a) fraud &lt;br&gt;
(b) malicious prosecution &lt;br&gt;
(c) false imprisonment &lt;br&gt;

===== History and legal development =====
The terms in this law derive from the [[Larceny Act 1916]] sections 29 - 31, which itself draws on the [[Libel Act 1843]] and the [[Larceny Act 1861]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2230.1941.tb00878.x The Development of Blackmail - W.H.D. WInder]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, s.30 refers to a person who demands "with menaces or by force". An offence also existed in [[common law]]: for example in R. v Woodward (1707) it was stated that "Every extortion is an actual trespass, and an action of trespass will lie against a man for frighting another out of his money. If a man will make use of a process of law to terrify another out of his money, it is such a trespass as an indictment will lie." The 1805 case ''R v. Sodherton'' stated that a threat needed to be such that a "firm and prudent man" would be overcome by it, and concluded that "The law distinguishes between threats of actual violence against the person, or such other threats as a man of common firmness cannot stand against, and other sorts of threats. Money obtained in the former cases under the influence of such threats may amount to robbery, but not so in cases of threats of other kinds".&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; 

The origin of the modern offence lay in the 1723 [[Black Act]],&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; which  addressed a group of notorious [[poaching|poachers]] and [[extortion]]ers.&lt;ref&gt;See preamble to the Black Act for details&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823 an Act{{which|date=June 2018}} was passed that criminalised "demanding money or other valuable thing" (1823) where no reasonableness or menace was required, and in 1927 this was updated in a further Act{{which|date=June 2018}} to cover "any letter or writing demanding of any person, with menaces, and without reasonable or probable cause", thus mentioning menaces for the first time in the context of blackmail.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The 1827 offence was in turn replaced in 1837 by an offence concerning any person who “with menaces or by force, demand(s) any property of any person with intent to steal".&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; In the Larceny Act 1916 the element of "taking" included taking by [[intimidation]] based on an earlier case ''R v. McGrath''.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; 

Before the enactment of section 21 of the Theft Act 1968, the word blackmail was not a legal term of art. The word was used by lawyers as a convenient way of referring to the offences under section 29 to 31 of the [[Larceny Act 1916]],&lt;ref name="Griew, Edward page 183"/&gt; and those offences were commonly known as blackmail.&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, paragraph 21-264 at page 1822&lt;/ref&gt; But the word blackmail did not appear anywhere in that Act.&lt;ref name="Griew, Edward page 183"/&gt; In early legal history, the term appears to have referred to the extorted property itself, and included by reference both the perpetrator and the victim - the legal position was that the victim was as equally culpable as the extortioner, insofar as he/she had given in to extortion and thereby made it profitable to extort.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; 

Hogan described these offences as "an ill-assorted collection of legislative bric a brac which the draftsmen of the 1916 Act put together with scissors and paste."&lt;ref&gt;Hogan [1966] Crim LR 474&lt;/ref&gt;

They were replaced in 1968 by section 21 of the [[Theft Act 1968|Theft Act]].

====Northern Ireland====
The offence of blackmail is created by section 20&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apni/1969/16/section/20|title=Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969]] of the [[Northern Ireland Parliament]]. It is derived from and identical to section 21 of the Theft Act 1968 of England and Wales.

===United States===
The offense of blackmail is created by {{usc|18|873}} which provides:

"Whoever, under a threat of informing, or as a consideration for not informing, against any violation of any law of the United States, demands or receives any money or other valuable thing, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/873-|title=18 U.S. Code § 873 - Blackmail|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====Austria====
For the offense of blackmailing in Austria the punishment is imprisonment for a time from six months up to five years according to §144&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jusline.at/gesetz/stgb/paragraf/144|title=§ 144 StGB (Strafgesetzbuch), Erpressung - JUSLINE Österreich|first=ADVOKAT|last=Unternehmensberatung|date=|website=www.jusline.at}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Austrian Criminal Code.

====Germany====
In the German Criminal Code, the offense of blackmail (Erpressung) is set to be punishable by a fine or imprisonment up to five years. Specific laws exist for continuous blackmail threats or offenses against constitutional organs or against personal freedom in case of abduction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/|title=GERMAN CRIMINAL CODE|author=|date=|website=www.gesetze-im-internet.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====France====
The French Code pénal considers the offense of blackmail (chantage) with a fine of up to 75 000 euros or imprisonment for 5 years in Article 312-10. Blackmailing in French law falls under the section of extortion. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=84C7A6ECF6DA66B58599DD53BA924500.tpdila19v_1?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006418180&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;dateTexte=20170813&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections to criminalization==
Some people consider that blackmail ought not be considered a crime.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Walter, “[http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/block_blackmail-as-a-victimless-crime-1999.pdf Blackmail as a Victimless Crime],” with Robert McGee,  Bracton Law Journal, Vol. 31, pp. 24–28 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Block, Walter, “[http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/block_blackmailing-for-mutual-good-reply-to-hardin-2000.pdf Blackmailing for Mutual Good: A Reply to Russell Hardin],” Vermont Law Review, Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 121–141 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that it is legal (in the United States at this moment in time) to [[gossip]] about someone else's secret, to threaten to publicly reveal such information, and to ask a person for money, but it is illegal to combine the threat with the request for money. They say this raises the question, "Why do two rights make a wrong?"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Second Paradox of Blackmail|author=Walter Block, N. Stephan Kinsella and Hans-Hermann Hoppe|publisher=Business Ethics Quarterly|volume=10|number=3|date=Jul 2000|pages=593–622|jstor=3857894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This observation has been rebutted by pointing out that while drinking alcohol and driving are both legal separately, their [[Driving under the influence|combination]]s are not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.law.utulsa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1289&amp;context=fac_pub Russell Christopher: Meta-Blackmail] 94 Geo. L. J. 739 (2006). Page 744, reference 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sextortion (Webcam Blackmail)==
"Criminals might befriend victims online by using a fake identity and then persuade them to perform sexual acts in front of their webcam, often by using an attractive woman to entice the victim to participate. These women may have been coerced into these actions using financial incentives or threats." As reported by the NCA (National Crime Agency), both men and women can be victims of this crime. This crime can be carried out by either crime groups or individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/crime-threats/kidnap-and-extortion/sextortion|title=National Crime Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2015, part of the group split into al-Qaeda affiliated [[Ansaru]], and Shekau's faction became ISIL's West Africa branch.

==Background==

===Nigerian statehood===
Nigeria was amalgamated both the Northern and Southern protectorate in 1914, only about a decade after the defeat of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] and other Islamic states by the British which were to constitute much of [[Northern Nigeria]]. Sir Frederick Lugard, assumed office as governor of both protectorates in 1912. The aftermath of the [[First World War]] saw Germany lose its colonies, one of which was [[Cameroon]], to French, Belgian and British mandates. Cameroon was divided in [[French Cameroon|French]] and [[British Cameroon|British parts]], the latter of which was further subdivided into [[Southern Cameroons|southern]] and [[Northern Cameroons|northern]] parts. Following a [[plebiscite]] in 1961, the [[Southern Cameroons]] elected to rejoin French Cameroon, while the [[Northern Cameroons]] opted to join Nigeria, a move which added to Nigeria's already large Northern Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meredith|first1=Martin|author-link=Martin Meredith|title=[[The State of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence]]|publisher=The Free Press|page=197|chapter=11. A House Divided}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory made up much of what is now Northeastern Nigeria, and a large part of the areas affected by the insurgency.

===Early religious conflict in Nigeria===
{{main|Religious violence in Nigeria}}
Religious conflict in Nigeria goes [[Kano riot of 1953|as far back as 1953]]. The [[1966 anti-Igbo pogrom|Igbo massacre of 1966]] in the North that followed the [[Nigerian Counter-Coup of 1966|counter-coup of the same year]] had as a dual cause the [[1966 Nigerian coup d'etat|Igbo officers' coup]] and pre-existing (sectarian) tensions between the Igbos and the local Muslims. This was a major factor in the [[Biafran secession]] and the [[Nigerian civil war|resulting civil war]].

===Maitatsine===
{{main|Maitatsine|Yan Tatsine}}
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a major Islamic uprising led by [[Maitatsine]] (Mohammed Marwa) and his followers, [[Yan Tatsine]] that led to several thousand deaths. After Maitatsine's death in 1980, the movement continued some five years more.

In the same decade the erstwhile military ruler of Nigeria, General [[Ibrahim Babangida]] enrolled Nigeria in the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]]. This was a move which aggravated religious tensions in the country, particularly among the Christian community.&lt;ref name= AP&gt;Holman, Michael (24 February 1986) "Nigeria, Politics; Religious Differences Intensify", ''Financial Times'',&lt;/ref&gt; In response, some in the Muslim community pointed out that [[Member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation#Member states|certain other African member states]] have smaller proportions of Muslims, as well as Nigeria's diplomatic relations with the [[Holy See]].

===Establishment of Sharia===

{{See also|Sharia in Nigeria}}
Since the return of democracy to [[Nigeria]] in 1999, [[Sharia]] has been instituted as a main body of civil and criminal law in 9 Muslim-majority and in some parts of 3 Muslim-plurality states, when then-[[Zamfara State]] governor [[Ahmad Rufai Sani]]&lt;ref name=BBC_sharia/&gt; began the push for the institution of Sharia at the state level of government. This was followed by controversy as to the would-be legal status of the non-Muslims in the Sharia system. A spate of Muslim-Christian riots soon emerged.

In the primarily Islamic northern states of Nigeria, a variety of Muslim groups and populations exist, who favour the nationwide introduction of [[Sharia|Sharia Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.unilorin.edu.ng/courseware/religion/RIS%20128.pdf | title= Course Lecture: Muslim Groups in Nigeria | work=Unilorin| accessdate=7 June 2014 | author=Olawale, Abdul-Gafar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demands of these populations have been at least partially upheld by the Nigerian Federal Government in 12 states, firstly in Zamfara State in 1999. The implementation has been widely attributed as being due to the insistence of [[Zamfara State]] governor [[Ahmad Rufai Sani]].&lt;ref name=BBC_sharia&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1885052.stm | title=Nigerian Sharia architect defends law  | work=BBC| date=20 May 2014 | accessdate=7 June 2014 |author1=Jonah, Adamu  |author2=Igboeroteonwu, Anamesere |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death sentences of [[Amina Lawal]] and [[Safiya Hussaini]] attracted international attention to what many saw as the harsh regime of these laws. These sentences were later overturned;&lt;ref name="HRW 2002"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2002/01/08/nigeria-first-execution-under-sharia-condemned | title=Nigeria: First Execution under Sharia Condemned | work=[[Human Rights Watch]]| date=8 January 2002 | accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first execution was carried out in 2002.&lt;ref name="HRW 2002"/&gt;

====Blasphemy and apostasy====

===Demographic balance===
According to a Nigerian study on [[Demographics of Nigeria|demographics]] and [[Religion in Nigeria|religion]], [[Islam in Nigeria|Muslims]] make up 50.5% of the population. Muslims mainly live in the north of the country; the majority of the Nigerian Muslims are [[Sunni]]s. [[Christianity in Nigeria|Christians]] are the second-largest religious group and make up 48.2% of the population. They predominate in the central and southern part of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewforum.org/world-affairs/countries/?countryID=150 "Religious Demographic Profile: Nigeria"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421200729/http://pewforum.org/world-affairs/countries/?CountryID=150 |date=21 April 2010 }}.

==History==
{{main|Timeline of the Islamist insurgency in Nigeria}}

===2009 Boko Haram uprising===
{{Main|2009 Boko Haram uprising}}
Boko Haram conducted its operations more or less peacefully during the first seven years of its existence.&lt;ref name="CTC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/the-rise-of-boko-haram-in-nigeria|title=The Rise of Boko Haram in Nigeria|author=Cook, David|date=2011-09-26|publisher=Combating Terrorism Centre|accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; That changed in 2009 when the Nigerian government launched an investigation into the group's activities following reports that its members were arming themselves.&lt;ref name="Nigeria accused of ignoring sect warnings before wave of killings"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/02/nigeria-boko-haram-islamist-sect|title=Nigeria accused of ignoring sect warnings before wave of killings | date=2009-08-02|accessdate=2009-08-06|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that the government reportedly repeatedly ignored warnings about the increasingly militant character of the organisation, including that of a military officer.&lt;ref name="Nigeria accused of ignoring sect warnings before wave of killings"/&gt;

When the government came into action, several members of the group were arrested in [[Bauchi]], sparking deadly clashes with Nigerian security forces which led to the deaths of an estimated 700 people. During the fighting with the security forces Boko Haram fighters reportedly "used fuel-laden motorcycles" and "bows with poison arrows" to attack a police station.&lt;ref name="Nossiter"/&gt; The group's founder and then leader Mohammed Yusuf was also killed during this time while still in police custody.&lt;ref name="Nigerian Islamist attacks spread"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8169966.stm|title=Nigerian Islamist attacks spread | date = 2009-07-27 | accessdate=2009-07-27|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Over 100 dead in Nigerian clashes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0727/nigeria.html|title=Over 100 dead in Nigerian clashes|date=2009-07-27|accessdate=2009-07-27|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/02/20102102505798741.html|title=Nigeria killings caught on video|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Yusuf's killing, [[Abubakar Shekau]] became the leader and held this position in January 2015.&lt;ref name=Batolotta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2011/09/19/terrorism-nigeria-rise-boko-haram|title=Terrorism in Nigeria: the Rise of Boko Haram|last=Bartolotta|first=Christopher|date=19 September 2011|publisher=The World Policy Institute|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 resurgence===
After the killing of M. Yusuf, the group carried out its first terrorist attack in [[Borno State|Borno]] in January 2010. It resulted in the killing of four people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribune.com.ng/index.php/front-page-news/16402-boko-haram-strikes-again-in-borno-kills-4 Boko Haram strikes again in Borno, kills 4] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314062201/http://www.tribune.com.ng/index.php/front-page-news/16402-boko-haram-strikes-again-in-borno-kills-4 |date=14 March 2012 }}.

In September 2010, a [[Bauchi prison break]] freed more than 700 Boko Haram militants, replenishing their force.

===2011===
On 29 May 2011, a few hours after [[Goodluck Jonathan]] was sworn in as president, [[May 2011 northern Nigeria bombings|several bombings purportedly by Boko Haram]] killed 15 and injured 55. On 16 June, Boko Haram claimed to have conducted the [[2011 Abuja police headquarters bombing|Abuja police headquarters bombing]], the first known suicide attack in Nigeria. Two months later the [[2011 Abuja United Nations bombing|United Nations building in Abuja was bombed]], signifying the first time that Boko Haram attacked an international organisation. In December, it carried out [[2011 Damaturu attacks|attacks in Damaturu]] killing over a hundred people, subsequently [[December 2011 Nigeria clashes|clashing with security forces in December]], resulting in at least 68 deaths. Two days later on [[December 2011 Nigeria bombings|Christmas Day, Boko Haram attacked]] several Christian churches with bomb blasts and shootings.

15 June 2011 also marked the start of a Federal Government sanctioned military effort to counter the growing threat of Boko Haram's insurgency. With 21 Armoured Brigade (21 Bde) of the Nigerian Army as its nucleus, Joint Task Force Operation Restore Order (JTF ORO 1) marked the start of the Army's lengthy counter-insurgency (COIN) campaign against Boko Haram. The campaign has gone through several phases and has greatly escalated in scale, capacity, components and stakeholders, since that time.&lt;ref&gt;Omeni, Akali. 2017.

Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Results, however, have sometimes been mixed and the Army has been criticised for being too kinetic in its COIN.

===2012===
In January 2012, [[Abubakar Shekau]], a former deputy to Yusuf, appeared in a video posted on [[YouTube]].

In May 2013, Nigerian government forces launched an offensive in the Borno region in an attempt to dislodge Boko Haram fighters after a state of emergency was called on 14 May.

First responders were unable to reach the scenes of the accidents, as "thousands of people were fleeing the scene in the opposite direction". The bombs had been positioned to kill as many people as possible, regardless of religion, which differed from previous attacks in which non-Muslims were targeted.

On 7 March 2015, Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau pledged allegiance to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) via an audio message posted on the organisation's Twitter account.&lt;ref name="Boko Haram joins ISIL"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/03/08/boko-haram-swears-formal-allegiance-to-isis/ |title=Boko Haram swears formal allegiance to ISIS| others=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News|date=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-31784538|title = Nigeria's Boko Haram pledges allegiance to Islamic State|date = 2015-03-07 |accessdate = 2015-03-07|website = BBC news|publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/03/boko-haram-pledges-allegiance-islamic-state/387235/ |title=The Islamic State of Boko Haram? :The terrorist group has pledged its allegiance to ISIS.

Following its declaration of loyalty to ISIL, Boko Haram was designated as the group's "West Africa Province" while Shekau was appointed as its first [[Vali (governor)|vali]] (governor). Furthermore, ISIL started to support Boko Haram, but also began to interfer in its internal matters. For example, ISIL's central leadership attempted to reduce Boko Haram's brutality toward civilians and internal critics, as Shekau's ideology was "too extreme even for the Islamic State".&lt;ref name="Province vs Shekau"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aymennjawad.org/21467/the-islamic-state-west-africa-province-vs-abu |title=The Islamic State West Africa Province vs. Abu Bakr Shekau: Full Text, Translation and Analysis |author=[[Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi]] |work= |date=5 August 2018 |accessdate=17 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American military support===
In early October 2015, the US military deployed 300 troops to Cameroon, with the approval of the Cameroonian government, with the primary mission of providing intelligence support to local forces, and conducting reconnaissance flights.&lt;ref name="US1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="US2" /&gt;

The troops are also overseeing a program to transfer American military vehicles to the Cameroonian Army to aid in their fight against Islamist militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/land/vehicles/2015/10/20/us-sending-troops-vehicles-to-cameroon-to-combat-boko-haram/74265026/ |title=US Sending Troops, Vehicles To Cameroon To Combat Boko Haram |publisher=Defensenews.com |date=2015-10-20 |accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, Boko Haram was reported to have used islands in [[Lake Chad]] as bases.&lt;ref name="Chad"&gt;{{cite news|title=Boko Haram militants 'took my children' in Chad|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-35882396|accessdate=25 March 2016|publisher=BBC News Africa|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As Boko Haram's power waned, Shekau's leadership was increasingly criticised among Boko Haram and ISIL's central command. These elements repeatedly attempted to convince Shekau to change his tactics or his extreme ideas (such as considering everyone an apostate who has not openly sided with him, including all Muslims). Shekau refused to budge, and openly disobeyed ISIL's "[[Caliph]]" [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]] in regard to various matters. ISIL and parts of Boko Haram eventually came to the conclusion that this was no longer tolerable, whereupon Shekau was removed from his position as vali of ISIL's West Africa Province in August 2016. [[Abu Musab al-Barnawi]], a son of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf was appointed as his successor. This event resulted in an open split among the Nigerian insurgents. Shekau refused to accept his dismissal, rallied a large number of supporters and violently opposed Barnawi and ISIL's central command. In turn, Barnawi and those who were loyal to him declared Shekau's group ''[[Khawarij]]''. Since then, the two Boko Haram factions no longer cooperate and have even clashed with each other.&lt;ref name="Province vs Shekau" /&gt;

On 31 August 2016, Major General Lucky Irabor stated that the militants now only controlled a few villages and towns near Lake Chad and in Sambisa forest. He further stated that the military expected recapturing the final strongholds of the group within weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigerian Army Commander: Only Weeks Left for Boko Haram|url=http://english.aawsat.com/2016/09/article55357543/nigerian-army-commander-weeks-left-boko-haram|accessdate=2 September 2016|publisher=Asharq al-Awsat|date=1 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901194717/http://english.aawsat.com/2016/09/article55357543/nigerian-army-commander-weeks-left-boko-haram#|archive-date=1 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Boko Haram militants kidnapped about 40 young adults, women and children and killed 18 in the town of Banki, 130&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Maiduguri]], Borno State, on the border of Nigeria and Cameroon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/world/boko-haram-kidnaps-dozens-and-kills-18-in-brutal-raid-on-camp-pqsbxf3wh|title=Boko Haram kidnaps dozens and kills 18 in brutal raid|last=Kelley|first=Jeremy|date=2017-09-08|work=The Times|access-date=2017-09-08|last2=Alfa|first2=Ismail|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boko Haram was reported to have killed 380 people between April and September 2017 in the Lake Chad area .&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; About 57% of all schools in Borno state were closed due to the Boko Haram insurgency, affecting the education of about 3 million children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=57773#.Wc_nyo-CzIV | title=Over half of schools remain closed in epicentre of Boko Haram crisis in Nigeria – UNICEF | date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018===
By March 2018, two main Boko Haram factions were still active, and continued to wage an insurgency campaign against the government: The followers of Abubakar Shekau operated mainly in southern Borno State, while the faction of Abu Musab al-Barnawi was mostly located around [[Lake Chad]].&lt;ref name="Dialogue End"/&gt;

On 26 April 2018, Boko Haram bombers killed at least four civilians in the outskirts of Maiduguri, the largest city in Borno State. A subsequent gun battle and tear gas launched by security forces repelled the attackers, but left two officers wounded and several others injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boko Haram bomb attacks kill four civilians in Nigeria|url=http://www.shiitenews.org/index.php/rest-of-world/item/34199-boko-haram-bomb-attacks-kill-four-civilians-in-nigeria|website=Shiite News|publisher=Shiitenews.com|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 July 2018, hundreds of Nigerian soldiers went missing after the Boko Haram faction led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi overran a Nigerian army base in the northeastern part of Nigeria. Less than 100 Nigerian soldiers returned after the attack, the attack came 24 hours after ISIL ambushed a military convoy in the neighboring Borno state. The attack on the base resulted in a battle that lasted over an hour, it is unknown if there were any casualties in the assault, a local pro-government militia said the military had sustained some casualties, this attack marks Boko Haram's first major gain since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/07/hundreds-of-nigerian-troops-missing-after-boko-haram-overruns-base/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 September 2018, Boko Haram fighters managed to overrun and capture the town of Gudumbali in [[Borno State]], marking their first major gain in nearly two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/boko-haram-captures-nigerian-town-after-troop-attack-10698522 |title=Boko Haram captures Nigerian town after troop attack |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |date= |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, on 9 September 2018, ISIL's West Africa Province released a video showing footage from combat with the [[Nigerian Army]] in the area.&lt;ref&gt;https://jihadology.net/2018/09/08/new-video-message-from-the-islamic-state-disperse-by-means-of-them-wilayat-gharb-ifriqiyyah/&lt;/ref&gt;

The North consisted of [[Sahelian kingdoms|Sahelian states]] that had long Islamic character.

Chris Kwaja, a Nigerian university lecturer and researcher, asserted in 2011 that "religious dimensions of the conflict have been misconstrued as the primary driver of violence when, in fact, disenfranchisement and inequality are the root causes". Nigeria, he pointed out, has laws giving regional political leaders the power to qualify people as 'indigenes' (original inhabitants) or not. It determines whether citizens can participate in politics, own land, obtain a job, or attend school. The system is abused widely to ensure political support and to exclude others. Muslims have been denied indigene-ship certificates disproportionately often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nigeria’s Pernicious Drivers of Ethno-Religious Conflict|publisher=Africa Center for Strategic Studies |author= Chris Kwaja|date=July 2011|issue=14|journal=Africa Security Brief|url=http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/africa-security-brief/asb-14.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303230823/http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/Africa-Security-Brief/ASB-14.pdf|archivedate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
{{main|Human rights in Nigeria}}
The conflict has seen numerous human rights abuses conducted by the Nigerian security forces, in an effort to control the violence,

Latest update: Thursday 24 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as their encouragement of the formation of numerous vigilante groups (for example, the [[Civilian Joint Task Force]]).

[[Amnesty International]] accused the Nigerian government of [[human rights]] abuses after 950 suspected Boko Harām militants died in detention facilities run by Nigeria's military Joint Task Force in the first half of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/nigeria-deaths-hundreds-boko-haram-suspects-custody-requires-investigation-2013-10-15 |title=Nigeria: Deaths of hundreds of Boko Haram suspects in custody requires investigation |publisher = Amnesty International |date= 15 Oct 2013 |accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of early 2016, according to Amnesty International, at least 8,000 detainees have died in detention facilities operated by the security services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Another brutal attack by Boko Haram highlights the weakness of Nigeria’s military|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21690136-recent-attack-reflects-badly-military-reforms-boko-back|accessdate=8 February 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Nigerian government has been accused of incompetence and supplying misinformation about events in more remote areas.

Boko Haram has kidnapped several young schoolgirls in Borno, physically, psychologically and sexually abusing them, using and selling them as [[Sexual slavery|sex slaves]] and/or brides of [[forced marriage]]s with their fighters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/155894-group-asks-nigerian-government-to-rescue-20-kidnapped-female-students-in-borno.html Group asks Nigerian government to rescue 20 ‘kidnapped’ female students in Borno.] Premium Times Nigeria; published 27 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; - the most famous example being the Chibok kidnapping in 2014.

==International context==
{{main|Global War on Terrorism}}
The insurgence can be seen in the context of other conflicts nearby, for example in the North of Mali. The Boko Harām leadership has international connections to [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]], [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]], the [[Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa]] (MUJAO), [[Mokhtar Belmokhtar]]’s factions, and other militant groups outside Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27529566 "UN committee imposes sanctions on Nigeria's Boko Haram".] BBC News online, 23 May 2014.

Retrieved 2 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and should not be confused with the activities of other groups (for example, the responsibility of AQIM for most attacks in Niger). Despite this, there were concerns that conflict could spread to Nigeria’s neighbours, especially Cameroon, where it existed at a relatively low level until 2014, subsequently escalating considerably. It should also be noted there are combatants from neighboring Chad and Niger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8174399.stm Captives freed in Nigerian city], BBC News online, 2009-Jul-29.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Boko Haram swore allegiance to [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]].&lt;ref name="Boko Haram joins ISIL"/&gt;

On 17 May 2014, the presidents of Benin, Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria and Niger met for a summit in Paris and agreed to combat Boko Harām on a coordinated basis, sharing in particular surveillance and intelligence gathering.

The '''Bolshoi Theatre''' ({{lang-rus|Большо́й теа́тр|r=Bol'shoy Teatr, Big Theatre|p=bɐlʲˈʂoj tʲɪˈatər}}) is a historic theatre in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], originally designed by architect [[Joseph Bové]], which holds [[ballet]] and [[opera]] performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bolshoi.ru/en/about/hist/mission/ |title=Mission |work=Bolshoi Theatre |accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[October Revolution]] it was a part of the [[Imperial Theatres]] of the [[Russian Empire]] along with [[Maly Theatre (Moscow)|Maly Theatre]] (''Small Theatre'') in Moscow and a few theatres in Saint Petersburg ([[Hermitage Theatre]], [[Bolshoi Theatre, Saint Petersburg|Bolshoi (Kamenny) Theatre]], later [[Mariinsky Theatre]] and others).

The [[Bolshoi Ballet]] and Bolshoi Opera are amongst the oldest and most renowned ballet and opera companies in the world. It is by far the world's biggest ballet company, with more than 200 dancers.&lt;ref name="GDN"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/mar/22/bolshoi-rocked-by-scandal |title=Bolshoi rocked by scandal and intrigue |work=The Guardian |location=Manchester |first1=Miriam |last1=Elder |date=22 March 2011 |accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre is the parent company of [[The Bolshoi Ballet Academy]], a world-famous leading school of ballet. It has a branch at the Bolshoi Theater School in [[Joinville]], [[Brazil]].

The main building of the theatre, rebuilt and renovated several times during its history, is a landmark of Moscow and Russia (its iconic [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] façade is depicted on the [[Russian ruble|Russian 100-ruble banknote]]). On 28 October 2011, the Bolshoi re-opened after an extensive six-year renovation.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15480945 "Bolshoi Theatre to reopen after major refit"], ''[[BBC News]]'' on bbc.co.uk, 28 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The official cost of the renovation is 21 billion rubles ($688 million). However, other Russian authorities and other people connected to it claimed much more public money was spent.&lt;ref name="TMT"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/bolshoi-theater-to-reopen-after-restoration/446576.html| title=Bolshoi Theater to reopen after restoration| work=[[The Moscow Times]]| first=Igor| last=Tabakov| date=27 October 2011| accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DSPG"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/jealousy-and-corruption-rumors-surround-attack-on-bolshoi-director-a-880232.html| title=Jealousy and corruption rumors surround attack on Bolshoi director| work=[[Der Spiegel]]| date=30 January 2013| first1=Susanne| last1=Beyer| first2=Benjamin| last2=Bidder| first3=Wladimir| last3=Pyljow| first4=Matthias| last4=Schepp |last-author-amp=y| accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovation included restoring acoustics to the original quality (which had been lost during the [[Soviet Era]]), as well as restoring the original Imperial decor of the Bolshoi.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

===Origins===
The company was founded on {{OldStyleDate|28 March|1776|17 March}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bolshoi.ru/en/about/hist/intro/ |title=In Short |work=Bolshoi Theatre |accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] granted Prince [[Pyotr Vasilyevich Urusov|Pyotr Urusov]] a licence to organise theatrical performances, balls and other forms of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bolshoi.ru/en/about/hist/history/ |title=History |work=Bolshoi Theatre |accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urusov set up the theatre in collaboration with English tightrope walker [[Michael Maddox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-news/8853787/The-Bolshoi-Theatre-a-rich-history.html |work=Daily Telegraph |title=The Bolshoi Theatre: a rich history |author=Andrew Osborn |date=27 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, it held performances in a private home, but it acquired the [[Petrovka Theatre]] and on 30 December 1780, it began producing plays and operas, thus establishing what would become the Bolshoi Theatre. Fire destroyed the Petrovka Theatre on 8 October 1805, and the New Arbat Imperial Theatre replaced it on 13 April 1808, however it also succumbed to fire during the French invasion of Moscow in 1812.

The first instance of the theatre was built between 1821 and 1824, designed and supervised to completion by architect [[Joseph Bové]] based upon an initial competition-winning design created by Petersburg-based Russian architect [[Andrei Mikhailov]] that was deemed too costly to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bolshoi.ru/about/hist/history/|title=История Большого театра|author=|date=|website=www.bolshoi.ru|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBJEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=Andrei+Mikhailov+architect&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LRU61bPTzG&amp;sig=-UQX8LXu0P90R8EJerZyKJlaWz0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiarOfCi-DZAhVos1QKHQsfC2IQ6AEIYzAO#v=onepage&amp;q=Andrei+Mikhailov+architect&amp;f=false|title=Landmarks of Russian Architect|first=|last=Brumfield|date=2 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=26 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bové also concurrently designed the nearby [[Maly Theatre (Moscow)|Maly Theatre]] and the surrounding [[Theater Square]], The new building opened on 18 January 1825 as the Bolshoi Petrovsky Theatre with a performance of [[Fernando Sor]]'s ballet, ''[[Cendrillon (ballet)|Cendrillon]]''. Initially, it presented only Russian works, but foreign composers entered the repertoire around 1840.

===Renovations in the 19th century===

In 1843 a large-scale reconstruction of  the theatre took place using a design by A. Nikitin, but a fire in 1853 caused extensive damage and so a further reconstruction was carried out, by [[Alberto Cavos]], son of the opera composer [[Catterino Cavos]]. On 20 August 1856, the Bolshoi Theatre reopened. Other repairs of the building took place in 1896.

===20th century===

On 7 December 1919 the house was renamed the '''State Academic Bolshoi Theatre'''. Only a few days later, however, on 12 December, there was an unsuccessful attempt to shut the institution entirely. [[Beethoven]] Hall opened on 18 February 1921. [[Ivan Rerberg]] directed further reconstruction of the theatre between 1921 and 1923.  A bomb damaged the structure during World War II, but this was promptly repaired.

===New stage of 2002===

A new stage for the Bolshoi Theatre, called the New Stage, went into service on 29 November 2002, constructed to the left of the theatre's historic main stage. Together with auxiliary buildings — a restored 17th-century building, two rehearsal halls, and artists' recreation rooms — it forms a single theatre complex, the '''Bolshoi Theatre of Russia'''. The new building is on a natural hill which it shared, until recently, blocks of old houses with communal apartments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://see-you-in-moscow.com/blog/the_new_stage_of_bolshoi_theatre_pictures/2010-06-14-109 The New Stage of Bolshoi Theatre] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716035134/http://see-you-in-moscow.com/blog/the_new_stage_of_bolshoi_theatre_pictures/2010-06-14-109# |date=2011-07-16 }}, See You in Moscow&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major rebuilding and renovation (2005–2011)===
[[File:The curtain of the Bolshoi Theater.png|thumb|200px|left|The curtain of the Bolshoi Theater]]
From July 2005 to October 2011 the theatre was closed for restoration. It had undergone many renovations in its time, but none as extensive. The building, whose architecture combines three different [[Architectural styles|styles]], was damaged and a quick renovation seemed to be necessary.

Repairs were initially estimated at 15 billion rubles  ($610 million) but engineers found that more than 75% of the structure was unstable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/04/arts/04arts-SAVINGBOLSHO_BRF.html| title=Saving Bolshoi Theater| first=Lawrence| last=Van Gelder| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=4 February 2008| accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result the cost estimate jumped to 25.5 billion [[Russian ruble|rubles]] (app. $850 million). At the completion of the work, however, it was announced that only 21 billion rubles ($688 mil) had been spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rian.ru/art_living/20111028/168218484.html |title=Bolshoi Theater raises curtain after six-year restoration |accessdate=29 Oct 2011 |date=28 Oct 2011 |publisher=RIA Novosti}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The Moscow Times]], the true cost may have been double that,&lt;ref name="TMT" /&gt; and [[Der Spiegel]] quotes a figure of $1.1 billion.&lt;ref name="DSPG" /&gt; The rebuilding and renovation was funded entirely by the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAL3193236820080131?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0| title=Bolshoi to reopen late in 2009 after rescue work| first=Chris| last=Baldwin| work=[[Reuters]]| date=31 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the long period of reconstruction, the company continued to mount productions, with performances held on the New Stage and on the stage of the [[Great Kremlin Palace]].

The renovation included an improvement in acoustics, to attempt to replicate the sound believed to have existed in pre-Soviet times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bolshoi.ru/en/about/hist/reconstruction/| title=The Theatre: Reconstruction| publisher=Bolshoi Theatre| accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the restoration of the original [[Russian Empire|Imperial]] decor.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The building's foundation and brickwork were thoroughly reset. Inside, the entire space was stripped from the bottom up. The 19th-century wooden fixtures, silver stage curtain and French-made red velvet banquettes were removed for repair in specialist workshops. Outside, on the top of the façade, the [[double-headed eagle]] of the original [[Coat of arms of Russia|Russian coat of arms]] was installed in the place where the [[State Emblem of the Soviet Union|Soviet hammer and sickle]] had been mounted for decades.

Finally, on 28 October 2011, the Bolshoi Theatre re-opened with a concert featuring international artists and the ballet and opera companies.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The first staged opera, [[Ruslan and Lyudmila]], followed soon after.

===Notable premieres===
The Bolshoi has been the site of many historic premieres, including:
*[[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Voyevoda (opera)|The Voyevoda]]'' and ''[[Mazeppa (opera)|Mazeppa]]''
*[[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s one version of ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' was given on 16 December 1888. 
*[[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Aleko (Rachmaninoff)|Aleko]]'' and ''[[Francesca da Rimini]]''
*[[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s opera ''[[The Maid of Pskov]]'', with [[Feodor Chaliapin]] singing the role of [[Ivan the Terrible]]
*[[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s  opera ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'' in 1935.

===Other notable facts===
*The first symphonic concert by the Bolshoi Orchestra took place at the Bolshoi Theatre on 4 May 1919, conducted by [[Serge Koussevitzky]]
*[[Leonid Sobinov]], [[Antonina Nezhdanova]], Ksenia Dzerzhinskaya, [[Galina Vishnevskaya]], and dozens of other outstanding opera singers have performed at the Bolshoi.
*The formal proclamation that the [[Soviet Union]] had been officially established was made from the stage of the Bolshoi.

==Ballet and opera==

The Bolshoi is a [[repertory|repertory theatre]], meaning that it draws from a list of productions, any one of which may be performed on a given evening.  It normally introduces two to four new ballet or opera productions each season and puts a similar number on hold.  The sets and costumes for most productions are made in the Bolshoi's own workshops. The performers are drawn primarily from the Bolshoi's regular ballet and opera companies, with occasional guest performances. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, there have been a few attempts to reduce the theatre's traditional dependence on large state subsidies. Corporate sponsorship occurs for some productions, but state funding is still the lifeblood of the company.

The Bolshoi has been associated from its beginnings with ballet. [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'' premiered at the theatre on 4 March 1877.  Other staples of the Bolshoi repertoire include Tchaikovsky's ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', Adam's ''[[Giselle]]'', [[Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', and [[Khachaturian]]'s ''[[Spartacus (ballet)|Spartacus]]''.

The chief ballet conductor from 1923 to 1963 was [[Yuri Fayer]].

After the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], the company toured internationally and became an important source of cultural prestige, as well as foreign currency earnings.  As a result, the "Bolshoi Ballet" became a well-known name in the West. However, the Bolshoi suffered from losses through a series of defections of its dancers. The first occurrence was on 23 August 1979, with [[Alexander Godunov]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Turmoil on the Tarmac| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948586-1,00.html| work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date=3 September 1979| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  followed by [[Leonid Kozlov]] and [[Valentina Kozlova]] on 16 September 1979; and other cases in the following years. Bolshoi continues to tour regularly with opera and ballet productions in the post-Soviet era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldofquotes.com/history/9_18/13/index.html |title=Today in History - September 18 |publisher=World ofQuotes |date= |accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Brouhaha at the Bolshoi| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947468,00.html| work=Time| date=1 October 1979| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
  
The opera company specializes in the classics of Russian opera such as [[Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'', [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]'s ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'', and [[Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s ''[[The Tsar's Bride (opera)|The Tsar's Bride]]'', as well as the operas of Tchaikovsky.  Many operas by western composers are also performed, especially works of Italian composers such as [[Rossini]], [[Verdi]], and [[Puccini]].  Until the mid-1990s, most foreign operas were sung in Russian, but Italian and other languages have been heard more frequently on the Bolshoi stage in recent years.

Some operas, such as Borodin's ''[[Prince Igor]]'', include extensive ballet sequences.  Many productions, especially of classic Russian opera, are performed on a grand scale, with dozens of costumed singers and dancers on stage for crowd or festival scenes.

==Orchestra==&lt;!--[[Mark Gorenstein]] links here--&gt;
[[File:Orchestra of the Bolshoi Theater in the workplace.png|thumb|200px|Orchestra of the Bolshoi Theater in the workplace]]
The orchestra of the Bolshoi Theatre is a virtuoso ensemble in its own right. It gives occasional concerts of symphonic music in the theatre and elsewhere, and has made recordings. Over the decades, it has toured overseas as the "Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra," the "Bolshoi Symphony Orchestra" and, most recently, as the "Bolshoi Orchestra."

Music director and chief conductor, [[Vassily Sinaisky]], quit abruptly at the start of December 2013, after a 41-month tenure, citing the need to avoid conflict. General director Vladimir Urin  promptly accepted his resignation and selected [[Tugan Sokhiev]] as replacement. Sokhiev's four-year contract, settled on 20 January 2014 and became effective immediately. The new chief also holds conductorships in Toulouse and Berlin.

==Cultural status==
[[File:Moscow 05-2017 img27 Bolshoy Theatre quadriga.jpg|right|270px|thumbnail|The [[quadriga]] was sculpted by [[Peter Clodt von Jürgensburg]].]]
The Bolshoi Theatre is world-famous and attracts large numbers of tourists. As a result, prices can be much higher than in other Russian theatres. This is especially the case for ballet, where prices are comparable to those for performances in the West. For local citizens, concerts and operas are still relatively affordable, with prices ranging from 100 rubles (for students, for balcony seats for matinée performances) to 15,000 rubles (for seats in the orchestra or stalls).

==Controversies==
*The rebuilding and renovation cost was $1.1 billion,&lt;ref name="DSPG" /&gt; sixteen times the initial estimate. In 2009 prosecutors alleged the lead contractor was paid three times for the same work.&lt;ref name="GDN" /&gt;
*[[Anastasia Volochkova]], a former Bolshoi prima ballerina, has said she sees the theatre "as a big brothel" because, she has claimed, ballerinas are invited to parties by theatre administrators and refused roles if they do not accept.&lt;ref name="GDN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DSPG" /&gt;
*On 17 January 2013, [[Sergei Filin]], the Bolshoi's ballet director, was attacked with sulfuric acid and as a result lost much of his eyesight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21319172| title=Bolshoi boss Sergei Filin leaves hospital for Germany| work=BBC News| date=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A male dancer was later charged with the crime.
*In the area of box office, a theatre insider told the German publication [[Der Spiegel]] that tickets are often sold to mafia dealers, who in turn sell them on the black market for double the face value.&lt;ref name="DSPG" /&gt;
*Performance quality has been criticized by the former music director [[Alexander Vedernikov]] (2001-2009). He has claimed the Bolshoi Theatre was putting "bureaucratic interests before artistic ones."&lt;ref name="GDN" /&gt;
* July 8th 2017, three days before the premiere, the Bolshoi Theatre called off the premiere of a ballet about legendary dancer [[Rudolf Nureyev]]. The Director General [[Vladimir Urin]] claimed it was due to the bad quality of the dancing, however the principle dancer [[Maria Alexandrova]] claimed it was the first sign of a 'new era' of censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BWR9VV3h0GY/?taken-by=aleksandrova_maria_bt |title=Maria Alexandrova Instagram Post |work=Instagram |date=8 July 2017 |accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time a show has been pulled in such a way since the collapse of the Soviet Union, sparking rumours about the motivation behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-40570212/bolshoi-theatre-postpones-rudolf-nureyev-ballet |title=Bolshoi Theatre postpones Rudolf Nureyev ballet |work=BBC News |date=11 July 2017 |accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Footnotes==
*The [[Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre]] used to exist in [[Saint Petersburg]]. It stood next to the Circus Theatre (rebuilt in 1860 as the [[Mariinsky Theatre]]), but it was replaced in the 1890s by the present-day building of the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory|St. Petersburg Conservatory]]. It was at St. Petersburg's Bolshoi that the first great Russian operas, Glinka's ''A Life for the Tsar'' and ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'', premiered.
*In a bit of ideological editing, the Bolshoi Theatre appears to be "destroyed" by the device of a split screen in [[Dziga Vertov]]'s ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1456">The '''Building Revival Campaign''' was run by [[Western Australia]]'s [[Royal Institute of Architects]] during the [[Great Depression]], with the aim of stimulating the home building industry. The most significant activity of the campaign was that of the '''Model Homes Committee''', which ran a competition for the design of two model homes, then oversaw their construction from donated material and labour. These became two of the first houses built in the new suburb of Floreat Park (now [[Floreat, Western Australia|Floreat]]). They still stand today, and are heritage listed by the [[Heritage Council of Western Australia]] under the names ''[[Model Brick Home]]'' and ''[[Model Timber Home]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Model Timber Home |work=Register of Heritage Places — Assessment Documentation |publisher=Heritage Council of Western Australia |url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/M%20-%20A-D/Model%20Timber%20Home%20(P-AD).PDF |accessdate=2009-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630112747/http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/M%20-%20A-D/Model%20Timber%20Home%20%28P-AD%29.PDF |archivedate=2009-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1492">'''Canboulay''' (from the French ''cannes brulées'', meaning burnt cane) is a precursor to [[Trinidad and Tobago Carnival]]. The festival is also where [[calypso music]] has its roots. It was originally a [[harvest festival]], at which drums, singing, dancing and chanting were an integral part. After Emancipation (1834), it developed into an outlet and a festival for former indentured laborers and freed slaves who were banned from participating in the masquerade carnival events – derived from European Christian traditions – of the colonial elite, and whose drums and religious observances were also outlawed in the late 19th century. Consequently, Canboulay has played an important role in the development of the [[music of Trinidad and Tobago]], for it was the banning of percussion instruments in the 1880s that led to the surreptitious innovations that gave birth to [[steelpan]] music. It is re-enacted in Port of Spain each Carnival Friday in Trinidad.

'''Depression glass''' is clear or colored translucent machine made glassware that was distributed free, or at low cost, in the United States and Canada around the time of the [[Great Depression]]. 

==History==
Much depression glass is [[uranium glass]]. The [[Quaker Oats Company]], and other food manufacturers and distributors, put a piece of glassware in boxes of food, as an incentive to purchase. Some movie theaters and businesses handed out pieces to patrons.

Most of this glassware was made in the Ohio River Valley of the United States, where access to raw materials and power made manufacturing inexpensive in the first half of the twentieth century. More than twenty manufacturers made more than 100 patterns, and entire dinner sets were made in some patterns. Common colors are clear (crystal), pink, pale blue, green, and amber. Less common colors include yellow (canary), ultramarine, [[Jadeite (kitchenware)|jadeite]] (opaque pale green), delphite (opaque pale blue), cobalt blue, red (ruby and royal ruby), black, amethyst, monax, and white (milk glass).

Although of marginal quality, Depression glass has been highly collectible since the 1960s. Due to its popularity as a [[collectible]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/east-jefferson/index.ssf/2011/03/crescent_city_depression_glass.html|title=Crescent City Depression glass show to be held in Kenner|publisher=The Times-Picayune |date=March 17, 2011|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is becoming more scarce on the open market. Rare pieces may sell for several hundred dollars. Some manufacturers continued to make popular patterns after World War II, or introduced similar patterns, which are also collectible. Popular and expensive patterns and pieces have been reproduced, and reproductions are still being made.

==Elegant glass==
Often confused with Depression glass is [[Elegant glass]], which is of much better quality. It was distributed through jewelry and department stores from the 1920s through the 1950s, and was an alternative to fine china. Most of the Elegant glassware manufacturers had closed by the end of the 1950s, when cheap glassware and imported china replaced Elegant glass. 

[[Image:Fostoriaplate.jpg|right|thumb|Fostoria plate]]

Some Elegant glass manufacturers were:
*[[Cambridge Glass Company]]
*[[Consolidated Lamp and Glass Company]]
*[[Duncan Miller Glass Company]]
*[[Fenton Art Glass Company]]
*[[Fostoria Glass Company]]
*[[Heisey Glass Company]]
*[[Imperial Glass Company]]

*[[Morgantown Glass Works]]
*[[New Martinsville Glass Company]]
*[[Paden City Glass Company]]

'''Evelyn Fowler Grubb''' (August 9, 1931 &amp;ndash; December 28, 2005) was the wife of an American Vietnam War Air Force pilot who became a prisoner of war, she was also a co-founder and then later served as the national coordinator of the [[National League of Families]],&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;"Evelyn Grubb, 74; Advocated Humane Treatment for POWs of Vietnam Era"Los Angeles Times Obituary, January 04, 2006, http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jan/04/local/me-grubb4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Grubb  | first = Evelyn  |author2=Carol Jose  | title = You Are Not Forgotten: A Family's Quest for Truth and the Founding of the National League of Families  | publisher = Vandamere Press  | date = 1 September 2008  | location = St. Petersburg, FL | isbn = 978-0-918339-71-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900EEDC1130F937A35752C0A9609C8B63 | title = Evelyn Fowler Grubb, 74, Leader Of a Group Supporting P.O.W.'s | accessdate = 2006-01-06 | publisher = New York Times | date=4 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit organization that worked on behalf of Vietnam-era [[Missing in Action]] ([[Missing In Action|MIA]]) and [[Prisoner of War]] ([[POW]]) Families. Grubb also oversaw the creation of the famous  [[POW/MIA flag|"You Are Not Forgotten" POW/MIA flag]] that still flies in front of all U.S. Post Offices, many firehouses and police stations, all major U.S. Military installations as well as most veterans organization chapters in the United States.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008" /&gt;

During the Vietnam war Grubb served as the Leagues liaison to the [[White House]], the [[United Nations]] and the [[Paris Peace Talks]].&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;

Grubb was also the co-author,  along with Carol Jose, of the award-winning book "You Are Not Forgotten: A Family’s Quest for Truth and The Founding of the National League of Families" about her personal struggle as the wife of a prisoner of war, and about her experiences helping to found the National League of Families.&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008"/&gt;

==Husband's Capture / Founding of the National League of Families==

Evelyn Grubb was living in the [[Petersburg, Virginia]] area as an Air Force wife when her husband, Major Wilmer Newlin Grubb, was shot down over North Vietnam and became a prisoner of war ([[POW]]) in 1966,&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wainwright, Loudon"&gt;Wainwright, Loudon; "When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again - or doesn't", Life Magazine; (November 10, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; and after frustrations with the U.S. government withholding information on the status of her husband and other POW and MIA soldiers and pilots, as well as the Pentagon's practice of pressuring affected families not to speak publicly about the status of their captured or missing loved ones, Evelyn Grubb co-founded the [[National League of Families]] with Air Force POW wife Mary Crowe, also living in Hampton at the time, and with [[Sybil Stockdale]],  a Navy pilot's wife living in [[Coronado, California]], whose husband was also a POW.&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stockdale, Jim and Sybil; 2008"&gt;Stockdale, Jim and Sybil; ''In Love and War'', (Naval Institute Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major impetus for starting the organization was that Grubb's combat casualty benefits, as well as those of many other POW and MIA wives, were delayed due to a Pentagon policy of waiting to confirm that U.S. soldiers and pilots who had become POWs or MIAs were not deserters, which was causing POW and MIA families great financial hardship at the time.&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008" /&gt; At the time that her benefits were being withheld, Grubb had four children, including a newborn child.&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008" /&gt; Grubb was later instrumental in reversing this policy.&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008" /&gt;

The Leagues purpose from the beginning was to bring pressure to bear on all governments involved in the conflict in order to improve treatment of prisoners of war ([[POW]]s), and their families, and to bring resolution to the status of many missing in action ([[Missing in action|MIA]]) soldiers and pilots.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stockdale, Jim and Sybil; 2008"/&gt; The League continues to this day in this work.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stockdale, Jim and Sybil; 2008"/&gt;

After years of Evelyn Grubb's work on behalf of Vietnam POW and MIA families, the Government of North Vietnam announced that her husband had died years earlier in captivity, a fact that they had knowingly withheld for eight years.&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt; Evelyn Grubb died of breast cancer in 2005.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt;

==POW/MIA Flag==

Grubb oversaw the Leagues development of the now-famous [[POW/MIA flag|"You Are Not Forgotten" POW/MIA flag]] in the early 1970s.[6][7] The original design for the flag was created by the artist Newt Heisley after a POW wife in Florida conceptualized it.[8] Evelyn Grubb was then also a driving force in gaining the flags adoption by the military, the U.S. Postal Service and other federal service agencies.[9] Eventually the flag became widely popular and adoption of its use began to spread on its own, as the flag became a national symbol of Vietnam war remembrance.[10] The flag, with the now widely recognized "You Are Not Forgotten, POW/MIA" logo is still flown in front of all U.S. post offices, all major U.S. military installations, and most fire stations, police stations, many state level agencies and also most veterans organizations chapters across the United States today, and is almost always present at most local and national veterans events in the United States.[11] The flag is consequently still visible to millions of Americans on a daily basis.[12]

==Early life==

Grubb was born in Pittsburgh and graduated from Pennsylvania State University.&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;Obituary for Evelyn Grubb, Los Angeles Times, January 2006, http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jan/04/local/me-grubb4&lt;/ref&gt;  She received a master's degree in education from Penn State in 1954&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"/&gt;  Her husband was serving in Vietnam, and was then captured while she was living  in Virginia.&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008"/&gt;

==Book==

===Writing===

Grubb wrote the award-winning book, with co-author Carol Jose, entitled "You Are Not Forgotten: A Family’s Quest for Truth and The Founding of the National League of Families".  A significant portion of the book was written by them during the three years up to Grubb's death from breast cancer in December 2005, but the book was still unfinished at the time, and Jose promised Grubb that it would be finished.&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008"/&gt; The book was published by Vandemere Press in 2008.&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008"/&gt;

===Book Award===

The book won the 2009 [[Next Generation Indie Book Awards|Indie Book Award]], in the "History" category.&lt;ref&gt;List of 2009 Indie Book Awards, "History" Category, Tied for First Place, {{cite web |url=http://www.indiebookawards.com/2009_winners_and_finalists.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809001026/http://www.indiebookawards.com/2009_winners_and_finalists.php |archivedate=2012-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forward in Book by Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger===

Former US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]], who met with Grubb many times during her tenure as the Leagues National Coordinator, wrote the forward to the book.&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008"/&gt; In the forward he emphasizes the importance of learning from some of the difficulties faced by Grubb and other POW and MIA wives of that era:&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008"/&gt;

{{quote|....It is only through the recording of incidents like the ones you will read about here, in the pages of You Are Not Forgotten, that we can study them, and hopefully learn from that experience.&lt;ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008"/&gt;}}

===C-Span Segment===

In November 2008, the cable television channel [[C-SPAN]] did a special segment on Evelyn Grubbs life and the book, hosting a talk given by the books co-author Carol Jose.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/282539-1 Video of C-SPAN special segment, Author Carol Jose speaks about the book "You Are Not Forgotten: A Family’s Quest for Truth and The Founding of the National League of Families"] Includes history of the creation of the POW/MIA flag&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''{{lang|fr|Festival Interceltique de Lorient}}''' (French), '''Gouelioù Etrekeltiek An Oriant''' (Breton) or '''Inter-Celtic Festival of Lorient''' in English, is an annual [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] festival, located in the city of [[Lorient]], [[Brittany]], [[France]]. It was founded in 1971 by {{ill|Polig Montjarret|fr}}.

This annual festival takes place in the heart of the city every August and is dedicated to the cultural traditions of the [[Celtic nations]] (''pays celtes'' in Brittany), highlighting [[Celtic music]] and [[dance]] and also including other arts such as [[painting]], [[photography]], [[theatre]], [[sculpture]], traditional [[artisan]] as well as [[sport]] and [[gastronomy]].

Participants come from [[Brittany]], [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]], [[Cumbria]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Cape Breton Island]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Asturias]], [[Acadia]], and the entire Celtic [[diaspora]].

==Introduction==
The main festival sites are located throughout the city. The more formal events take place at the  ''Palais des Congrès'', ''Grand Théâtre'' or ''Église Saint Louis''. The larger events take place at the ''Parc du Moustoir'' (the home of [[FC Lorient|Lorient Football Club]] which can hold up to {{formatnum:10000}} spectators), the ''Port de Pêche'' or in grand marquees.

The festival begins with the ''{{lang|fr|[[Cotriade]]}}'' (fr) or ''Kaoteriad'' (br), a traditional Breton seafood supper, which takes place in the ''{{lang|fr|Port de Pêche}}'' (fr) or ''Porzh Pesketa'' (br) harbour district accompanied by sea shanties and traditional Breton marine music.

On Sunday morning the spectacular ''Grand Parade of Celtic Nations'' takes place with over {{formatnum:3500}} musicians, singers, pipebands and dancers from all over the Celtic world parading through the city streets in [[national costume]].

The finals of the ''National [[Bagad]]où Championship'' takes place at the ''Parc de Moustoir'' during the first weekend of the festival, with strong competition between Brittany’s finest pipebands. In addition individual competitions take place for pipers.

For those early risers, [[Master class]]es take place each morning with some of the world’s premier [[harpist]]s, [[accordionist]]s, [[fiddlers]] and [[Bagpipes|pipers]].

Every afternoon hundreds of performers appear in folk and traditional music concerts and dance displays, and again in the evening there is a choice of several major events, including orchestral concerts, rock concerts and the not to be missed "Nuits Magiques", spectacular displays of pipe bands, dancers, choirs and fireworks!

Throughout the festival the "Village Celtique" (fr) or "Marc’had Etrekeltiek" (br) is open in the centre of the city offering food, music and literature, clothing and crafts.

On the final Saturday of the festival the focus again returns to the fishing harbour for the ''Nuit de Port de Pêche'', featuring the best of Brittany’s folk and rock musicians.

There is, of course, much activity on the festival fringe, with musicians giving free performances in many of the city’s bars and pubs every evening until late.

The festival organisers have more recently embarked on similar ventures such as the [[St Patrick's Day]] concert in [[Paris]], France which attracts a crowd of {{formatnum:70000}} spectators and the Celtica concert in [[Nantes]], Brittany.

[[Image:Formula RUS-START.JPG|thumb|Formula RUS cars on the grid]]

'''Formula RUS''' (Формула Русь) was a [[Russia]]n [[formula racing]] class, corresponding to [[FIA]]'s Formula Е category. The class was designed to help beginners and young [[Kart racing|karters]] make the transition to [[auto racing]]. The series ran from 2002 to 2007.

==Formula RUS Championship==

The Formula RUS Championship is a single-make Formula RUS series. Teams and drivers are restricted from making any changes to the car. The series organizers provide technical service to series participants and guarantee that all cars are identical, including car setup.

[[Image:FormulaRUS-car301.jpg|thumb|left|Formula RUS podium]]

The aim of Formula RUS  is to provide a practical and realistic platform for the novice racing driver, with an emphasis on the provision of education and development of race craft. 

In 1999 (and for the first time in Russian motor racing history), the concept of a mono-class, low budget, racing car first came about, and as a direct result of this concept and idea, the first batch of cars were produced. The car was designed so that it could be used for training drivers with very little racing experience and also for the purpose of taking part in official competitions. This project was carried out by AKKS Motorsport in 2001.

[[Image:FormulaRUS-car.jpg|thumb|Formula RUS car]]

Since 2002 and after having undergone a full and thorough testing programme Formula RUS now has over seventy cars in operation– over thirty of which are in operation at any one time.

Additionally, since 2002, Formula RUS has carried out the «Formula RUS Championship», which in 2003 was granted the status of the Championship of Russia.

During the five years of its existence, the formula has taken part in more than seventy races and carried out more than one hundred and seventy testing days. The series has also trained over two hundred and sixty racing drivers of ages ranging from sixteen to sixty – all of them with various degrees of racing skills and abilities and from the many various regions of the [[Russian Federation]] and the CIS.

Many Russian racing drivers owe the start of their careers in motorsport to Formula RUS, including: [[Sergey Afanasyev (racing driver)|Sergey Afanasyev]], [[Sergey Romaschenko]], [[Daniil Move]], [[Ivan Samarin (racing driver)|Ivan Samarin]], [[Vitaly Petrov]], [[Evgeny Novikov]], [[Kirill Ovcharenko]], [[Maxim Travin]], [[Sergey Mokshantsev]], [[Yuri Baiborodov]], [[Alexander Tyuryumin]], [[Viktor Antonov (racing driver)|Viktor Antonov]], and [[David Markozov]].

[[Image:Formula RUS 2007-1-106.jpg|thumb|Formula RUS car on track]]

[[File:Lutizenbund.PNG|thumb|320px|Territory of Lutici federation after 983, beyond the eastern border of the German kingdom (outlined in yellow)]]
The '''Great Slav Rising''' in 983 was an uprising of the [[Polabian Slavs]] ([[Wends]]), mainly [[Lutici]] and [[Obotrites|Obotrite]] tribes living east of the [[Elbe]] River in modern north-east [[Germany]]. They were revolting against [[Christianization]] and their subjugation to the [[Kingdom of Germany|German]] (former [[East Francia|East Frankish]]) realm of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

== Background ==
The Slavic peoples between the Elbe and the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast had been conquered and nominally converted to Christianity by the campaigns of the German king [[Henry the Fowler]] and his son [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], who in 962 was crowned Holy Roman Emperor. Otto had most recently defeated an alliance of Obotrite and [[Circipania|Circipani]] tribes at the 955 [[Battle on the Raxa]]. The conquered area east of the German [[Duchy of Saxony]] was initially organized within the vast [[Marca Geronis|Saxon Eastern March]] under Margrave [[Gero]], but divided into smaller marches upon his death in 965.

In order to stabilize his rule, Otto promoted the conversion of the Slavic population, establishing the bishoprics of [[Bishopric of Havelberg|Havelberg]] and [[Bishopric of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] in 948, followed by the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]] in 968, which in particular carried out active missionary work.

== Uprising ==
In 981 Archbishop [[Adalbert (archbishop of Magdeburg)|Adalbert of Magdeburg]], the "Apostle of the Slavs", died and his successor [[Gisilher (archbishop of Magdeburg)|Gisilher]] had to struggle with the resistance by the Magdeburg chapter. He was backed by Emperor [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]], who, however, was on campaign in [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]], where he suffered a disastrous defeat against the Sicilian [[Kalbids]] in the 982 [[Battle of Stilo]] and died the next year without having returned to Germany, leaving his minor son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] under the tutelage of the Empress consorts [[Theophanu]] and [[Adelaide of Italy|Adelaide of Burgundy]].

While there was internal dissention in the Holy Roman Empire, Slavic forces led by the Lutici revolted and drove out the political and religious representatives of the Empire. Starting from the Slavic sanctuary at [[Rethra]], the bishops' seat of Havelberg on 29 June 983 was occupied and plundered, followed by Brandenburg three days later and numerous settlements up to the [[Tanger (river)|Tanger]] River in the west. According to the contemporary chronicler [[Thietmar of Merseburg]], the Obotrites joined the Lutici, devastated a St Lawrence monastery in [[Kalbe, Saxony-Anhalt|Kalbe]], the bishopric of [[Oldenburg in Holstein|Oldenburg]] and even assaulted [[Hamburg]].

A hastily assembled Saxon army was only able to retain the Slavs behind the Elbe. The [[Northern March]] and the [[Billung March|March of the Billungs]] were lost. The [[March of Lusatia]] as well as the adjacent marches of [[March of Zeitz|Zeitz]], [[Merseburg]] and the [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] in the south did not take part in the uprising.

== Aftermath ==
From 985, several [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Princes of the Empire]] carried out annual campaigns together with the Christian [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Polish]] princes [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] and [[Bolesław I Chrobry]] to subjugate the area, however these campaigns were unsuccessful. In 1003 King [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II of Germany]] tried a different approach: he allied himself with the Lutici and waged war against his previous ally Prince Bolesław of Poland. This stabilized the independence of the Lutici and ensured that the area remained ruled by Polabian Slavs and unchristianized into the 12th century.

The immediate consequences of the uprising were an almost complete stop on further [[Ostsiedlung|German eastward expansion]] (''Ostsiedlung'') for the next 200 years. For most of the time, the dioceses of Brandenburg and Havelberg existed in [[Titular see|titular]] form only, with the bishops residing at the royal court. Only in the 12th century after the [[Wendish Crusade]] of 1147 and the establishment of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] under the [[House of Ascania|Ascanian]] prince [[Albert the Bear]] in 1157, the settlements east of the Elbe were resumed; followed by the northern lands of [[Mecklenburg]], where after several years of fighting against the Obotrite prince [[Niklot]], his son [[Pribislav of Mecklenburg|Pribislav]] in 1167 declared himself a vassal of the Saxon Duke [[Henry the Lion]].

'''''Guerra de Titanes''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "War of the Titans") was a major [[professional wrestling]] event scripted and produced by [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide]] (AAA), a Mexican [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]]. The event was the twentieth annual ''[[Guerra de Titanes]]'' show which, until 2015, has traditionally been AAA's "end of the year" show. In 2016 the show was shifted from December to January instead. The show was held in ''Gimnasio Juan de la Barrera'' in Mexico City, Mexico which also hosted the [[Guerra de Titanes (2016)|2016 ''Guerra de Titanes'']] show.

In the main event [[Johnny Mundo]] successfully defended the [[AAA Latin American Championship]] against former champion [[Pentagón Jr.]] The original main event match was moved down one stop for unexplained reasons and saw the team of [[Dr. Wagner Jr.]], [[El Mesías]] and [[Pagano (wrestler)|Pagano]] defeat [[La Parka (AAA)|La Parka]], [[Psycho Clown]] and [[El Texano Jr.]] [[El Hijo del Fantasma]] successfully defended the [[AAA World Cruiserweight Championship]] while [[Aero Star]] and [[Super Fly (wrestler)|Super Fly]] lost a [[steel cage match]] forcing them to fight in [[Lucha Libre#Lucha de Apuestas|Lucha de Apuestas]]. The show included two additional matches.

The day after ''Guerra de Titanes'' three AAA wrestlers, Pentagón Jr., [[Daga (wrestler)|Daga]] and [[Garza Jr.]] left AAA, making a surprise appearance at a "The Crash" event in Tijuana, announcing that they were no longer working for AAA.

==Production==
===Background===
Starting in 1997 the Mexican [[professional wrestling]], [[wrestling promotion|company]] [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] has held a major wrestling show late in the year, either November or December, called ''[[Guerra de Titanes]]'' ("War of the Titans"). The show often features championship matches or ''[[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Lucha de Apuestas]]'' or bet matches where the competitors risked their [[wrestling mask]] or hair on the outcome of the match. In ''[[Lucha Libre]]'' the ''Lucha de Apuetas'' match is considered more prestigious than a championship match and a lot of the major shows feature one or more ''Apuesta'' matches. The ''Guerra de Titanes'' show is hosted by a new location each year, emanating from cities such as [[Ciudad Madero|Madero]], [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua]], [[Mexico City]], [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]] and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/guerra.html | title = Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Guerra de Titanes| accessdate = January 27, 2017 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 AAA moved the ''Guerra de Titanes'' show to January,&lt;ref name=GdTMoved&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.com/2015/12/23/aaa-guerra-de-titanes-ya-tiene-nueva-sede-y-fecha/ | title=AAA: Guerra de Titanes ya tiene nueva sede y fecha | author=Dark Angelita | date=December 23, 2015 | accessdate=December 24, 2015 | publisher=SuperLuchas | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the 2017 version continuing that trend.&lt;ref name=Announced/&gt;

===Storylines===
[[File:Psycho Clown.jpg|thumb|right|[[Psycho Clown]], part of the main storyline in AAA along with [[Dr. Wagner Jr.]]]]
The ''Guerra de Titanes'' show featured six [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were viewed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

At [[Triplemanía XXIV|''Triplemanía'' XXIV]], AAA's biggest show of the year, [[Psycho Clown]] defeated [[Pagano (wrestler)|Pagano]] in the main event ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or "bet match".

==Aftermath==
The night after the show at a show promoted by The Crash in Tijuana, Baja California, Pentagón Jr., Daga and Garza Jr. made a surprise appearance during the show, alongside Pentagón Jr.'s brother [[Fénix el Rey]]. The trio announced that they had left AAA effective immediately. At the same time Pentagón Jr. announced that he would be known as "Penta El 0M" ("Cero Miedo") since AAA owned the rights to the name Pentagón Jr.&lt;ref name=Penta&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/lucha-libre/2017/01/22/dejo-de-pertenecer-a-aaa-soy-independiente-pentagon-jr | title=Dejo de pertenecer a AAA, soy Independiente: Pentagón Jr.| work=MedioTiempo | publisher=[[MSN]] | date=January 22, 2017 | accessdate=January 22, 2017 | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three wrestlers cited their unhappiness with AAA and the lack of opportunities they were given. It was later revealed that none of the wrestlers had told AAA they were leaving, which meant that both Pentagón Jr. and Garza Jr.'s championship losses were the planned finishes. When asked for a reaction to the three wrestlers leaving AAA officials simply stated that those that remained with AAA were happy to be there, not commenting further on the situation.

'''''How the Grinch Stole Christmas!''''' (also known as '''''Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!''''') is a 1966 Christmas [[Animation|animated]] [[television special]] directed and co-produced by [[Chuck Jones]]. It is based on the [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!|eponymous children's book]] by [[Dr. Seuss]], the story of the [[Grinch]] trying to take away [[Christmas]] from the townsfolk of [[Whoville]] below his mountain hideaway. Originally telecast in the United States on [[CBS]] on December 18, 1966, it went on to become a perennial holiday special. The special also features the voice of [[Boris Karloff]] as the Grinch and the narrator.

==Plot==
The Grinch (voiced by [[Boris Karloff]]) is the film's main character. He lives in a cave atop Mt. Crumpit, located above the village of Whoville. The Grinch is a surly character with a heart "two sizes too small" who has especially hated Christmas for 53 years. On [[Christmas Eve]], he finally becomes fed up with seeing the decorations and hearing all the music and caroling in the village and wishes he could stop [[Christmas Day]] from coming to Whoville. When he sees his dog, Max, with snow all over his face in the shape of a hat and beard, he decides to disguise himself as [[Santa Claus]] and steal Christmas.

The Grinch makes himself a Santa coat and hat and disguises the innocent Max as a [[reindeer]]. He loads empty bags onto a sleigh and travels to Whoville with some difficulty. In the first house he is almost caught by Cindy Lou Who (voiced by an uncredited [[June Foray]]&lt;ref name=CerealHero/&gt;), a small Who girl who wakes up and sees him taking the Christmas tree. Pretending to be Santa, the Grinch tells Cindy Lou that he is merely taking the tree to his workshop for repairs, and then gets her a drink before sending her back to bed. He empties the first house of all the food and Christmas-related items, namely presents, the tree, decorations and even the stockings on the chimney, then repeats the process at the other houses in Whoville, while also taking the village decorations.

With the Whos' stolen Christmas goods, the Grinch and Max travel back up Mt. Crumpit. Before dropping the loaded sleigh off the mountain, the Grinch waits to hear a sad cry from the Whos. However, down in the village, the Whos joyously begin to sing Christmas carols, proving that the spirit of Christmas does not depend on material things. The Grinch begins to understand the true meaning of Christmas, though he barely does so in time to prevent the stolen treats from going over the cliff and while he tries to stop the sleigh from falling off, his heart grows three sizes—granting him "the strength of ten Grinches, plus two!", which he needs to lift up the sleigh. He brings everything back to the Whos and participates in the holiday feast.  He is given the honor of carving the roast beast, while Max gets the first slice for himself for all his troubles.

==Production==
Director [[Chuck Jones]] and children's-book author Ted Geisel ([[Dr. Seuss]]) had worked together on the ''[[Private Snafu]]'' training cartoons at [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=toonopedia /&gt; Jones was interested in adapting one of Geisel's books into a television special and approached him to turn ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas!'' into one in time for the holiday season. Although Geisel was initially reluctant due to his unpleasant experiences making the film ''[[The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.]]'', he eventually agreed. ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas!'' was produced by The Cat in the Hat Productions in association with the [[MGM Television|television]] and [[MGM Animation/Visual Arts|animation]] divisions of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] Studios, where Jones was under contract at the time. CBS, coming off the surprise success of ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' a year before, allotted Jones and MGM a $315,000 budget, more than four times what [[Bill Melendez]] was offered to produce ''A Charlie Brown Christmas''.&lt;ref name=karloff/&gt; The original broadcast was sponsored by the Foundation for Full Service Banks whose sponsor plugs within the original airing were later edited out for subsequent broadcasts.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The entirety of the book's text, with some slight embellishment, was adapted into the special; to pad the special to a full 30-minute time slot, songs and animated sequences without words (the longest being an extended scene in which the Grinch and Max comically descend into Whoville) were added. As all the [[Big Three television networks|major networks]] had flipped to full [[color television|color]] schedules by 1966, the special was likewise produced in color, establishing the Grinch's color (white in the two-tone illustrations of the original book) as green, a convention used in later television specials featuring the character as well as the [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|2000]] and [[The Grinch (film)|2018]] film adaptations.

==Broadcast==
The half-hour (with commercials) short was originally telecast in the United States on [[CBS]] on December 18, 1966.&lt;ref name=toonopedia&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/grinch.htm Grinch] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/6f3zO0qHv Archived] from the original on February 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; CBS repeated it annually during the Christmas season until 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UPDATE / Lee Margulies |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-20/news/tv-318_1_animated-christmas-specials |accessdate=November 27, 2016 |publisher=[[latimes.com]] | date=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then aired on various other networks multiple times a season. In the 1990s and 2000s, it was primarily seen on [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner]]-owned properties ([[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]], and [[Cartoon Network]]), and later [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 2006 to 2014 and [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]]. On August 13, 2015, [[NBC]] announced that the special would move to that network, which would air it twice during the Christmas season under a three-year licensing deal with [[Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='How The Grinch Stole Christmas' Animated Special Moves To NBC – TCA |url=http://deadline.com/2015/08/how-the-grinch-stole-christmas-animated-special-nbc-1201498444/ |accessdate=August 14, 2015 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] | date=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The special was released in the midst of a wave of animated holiday specials, joining a number of other 1960s productions (such as 1964's ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'', 1965's ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' and 1969’s  ''[[Frosty the Snowman (film)|Frosty the Snowman]]'') that have come to be regarded as classics. It received modestly positive reviews at the time it was released. Critic Rick Du Brow said it was "probably as good as most of the other holiday cartoons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Christmas 'Theft' A Charming Hour |author=Rick Du Brow |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DrQiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=i7MFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4759,3878898&amp;dq=rick-du-brow+grinch&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Beaver County Times |date= December 19, 1966|accessdate=December 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been recognized as a classic, with [[Rotten Tomatoes]] giving it a 100% "fresh" rating on its website; the critical consensus reads, "''How the Grinch Stole Christmas'' brings an impressive array of talent to bear on an adaptation that honors a classic holiday story – and has rightfully become a yuletide tradition of its own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1006223-how_the_grinch_stole_christmas/ |title=How the Grinch Stole Christmas |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The special continues to be popular in [[Nielsen Ratings]], with its 2010 airing (the last of many times it had aired that year) winning its time slot among persons 18 to 49 and finishing second in overall viewers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/12/tv-ratings-cbs-reruns-dominate-abcs-double-grinch-wins-demo.html TV ratings: CBS reruns dominate, ABC's double-'Grinch' wins demo]. ''Zap2It''. Retrieved December 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked the special No.&amp;nbsp;1 on its 10 Best Family Holiday Specials list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TV Guide Guide to TV|year=2004|publisher=Barnes and Noble|isbn=978-0-7607-5634-8|page=574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home video releases==
''How the Grinch Stole Christmas!'' was released to [[VHS]], [[Betamax]], [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|CED]], and [[LaserDisc]] by [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Home Video]] in the 1980s, and was reissued several times. The special was first released to the VHS and [[DVD]] formats in 1999 and 2000 by [[Warner Home Video]], which acquired the rights to the MGM library in the late 1990s. The DVD release featured another Seuss-based special, ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (TV special)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'', and contained an audio commentary by Phil Roman and June Foray, interviews with Albert Hague and Thurl Ravenscroft, and the "Special Edition" documentary which aired alongside the special on TNT in 1994. The DVD was well-received for these bonus features, but also criticized for its sub-par picture quality; many critics pointed out that the Grinch looked ''yellow,'' not green, in this release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/grinchhorton.shtml |title=DVD Movie Guide: Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas/Horton Hears A Who!: Special Edition (1966) review |publisher=Dvdmg.com |date= |accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The special was re-released on DVD in 2006 and labeled as a "50th Birthday Deluxe Edition". That labeling refers to the 1957 date of the book's publication rather than to the date of the 1966 TV special. This DVD release featured a new retrospective featurette and contained all the bonus features from the previous release, except for the audio commentary, and the Grinch was restored to his original green color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/grinchdeluxe.shtml |title=DVD Movie Guide: Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas/Horton Hears A Who!: 50th Birthday Deluxe Edition (1966) review |publisher=Dvdmg.com |date= |accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition is also available as part of the four-disc ''Classic Christmas Favorites'' box set. The special was again re-released on DVD with Phil Roman's and June Foray's audio commentary replacing the ''Horton Hears a Who!'' bonus special. The special was released on high definition [[Blu-ray Disc]] in 2009 with the title changed to ''Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!'' It contained all the bonus features from the 2000 DVD, except for ''Horton Hears a Who!'', and also included a DVD of the special and a [[Digital Copy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hometheaterforum.com/forum/thread/290382/whv-press-release-seasonal-family-classics-combo-packs-Blu-ray |title=WHV Press Release: Seasonal Family Classics Combo Packs (Blu-ray) |publisher=Hometheaterforum.com |date=July 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
Three songs with lyrics were included in the special: "Welcome Christmas," "Trim up the Tree" and "[[You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch]]." The last of these was performed by [[Thurl Ravenscroft]]; the other two were performed by a chorus representing the voices of the Whos. None of the vocalists were credited at the time.

On December 18, 1966, [[MGM]] released a soundtrack LP in conjunction with the television special. CD releases include albums produced by Island (1995) and Mercury Records. In the recorded version, Boris Karloff does all voices including Cindy Lou Who. The song "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch", which comically describes the level of the Grinch's despicable nature, includes all verses with their original rhyming lyrics and the isolated song tracks have different durations due to being re-recorded.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

On October 5, 1999, [[Rhino Entertainment]] released a new CD soundtrack (which included the soundtrack for another Dr. Seuss cartoon, ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (TV special)|Horton Hears a Who]]''). Both story collections contain selected dialogue and music numbers. The "isolated music tracks" in this edition are taken directly from the television soundtrack and are not the re-recorded tracks from earlier versions. The dialogues are the originals, being voiced by Boris Karloff for "Grinch" and [[Hans Conried]] for "Horton."

Because Thurl Ravenscroft was not credited in the closing credits of the 1966 television special as singing the song "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch",&lt;ref name=CerealHero&gt;{{cite news |last1=McCracken |first1=Elizabeth |title=Our Cereal Hero |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/magazine/25raven.html |accessdate=December 24, 2014 |work=New York Times |date=December 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is sometimes attributed to Boris Karloff. After becoming aware of this oversight, Seuss himself called Ravenscroft and apologized profusely and later wrote letters to columnists nationwide telling them that it was Ravenscroft who provided vocals for the musical number.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Karloff received a [[Grammy Award for Best Album for Children|Grammy Award in the Spoken Word category]]—the only major performing award of his career—for the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312429/Boris-Karloff |title=Boris Karloff (British actor) – Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=March 18, 2014 |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels==
A television special called ''[[Halloween Is Grinch Night]]'', created by [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]], aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1977, eleven years after the Christmas special. This special involved a tale of the Grinch coming down to scare the Whos every Halloween. Though less successful than the original, it was awarded an [[Emmy]].&lt;ref name="Emmys.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdn.emmys.tv/awards/awardsearch.php |title=Primetime Emmy® Award Database &amp;#124; Emmys.com |publisher=Cdn.emmys.tv |date= |accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later cartoon, ''[[The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat]]'' (alternatively titled ''The Cat in the Hat Gets Grinched''), aired on ABC in 1982. Though credited to DePatie-Freleng, it was produced by [[Marvel Productions]], which had taken over DePatie-Freleng in 1981.

'''Irredentism''' is any political or popular movement that seeks to claim/reclaim and occupy a land that the movement's members consider to be a "lost" (or "unredeemed") territory from their nation's past.

Many states formalize their irredentist claims by including them in their constitutional documents, or through other means of legal enshrinement. Such territorial claims are justified on the basis of real or imagined national notions of historic territorial, religious or ethnic affiliations. Irredentist policies may be advocated by [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[pan-nationalism|pan-nationalist]] movements and have been a feature of [[identity politics]], and of [[cultural geography|cultural]], and [[political geography]]. Irredentism may operate as a device for a government to redirect their citizens' discontent against outsiders.

==Etymology==
{{Main|Italian irredentism}}
[[File:RegioniIrredenteItalia.jpg|thumb|240px|Map of the territories claimed as "irredent" in the 1930s (in green: [[Nice]], [[Ticino]] and [[Dalmatia]]; in red: [[Malta]]; in violet: [[Corsica]])]]

The word (from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''irredento'' for "unredeemed") was coined in [[Italy]] from the phrase ''Italia irredenta'' ("unredeemed Italy").&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Irredentists |volume=14 |page=840}}&lt;/ref&gt; This originally referred to rule by [[Austria-Hungary]] over territories mostly or partly inhabited by ethnic [[Italians]], such as [[Trentino]], [[Trieste]], [[Gorizia]], [[Istria]], [[Fiume]] and [[Dalmatia]] during the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Adda Bruemmer |last=Bozeman. |title=Regional Conflicts Around Geneva: An Inquiry Into the Origin, Nature, and Implications of the Neutralized Zone of Savoy and of the Customs-free Zones of Gex and Upper Savoy |year=1949 |location=Geneva |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZZ6aAAAAIAAJ|isbn=9780804705127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An area that may be subjected to a potential claim is sometimes called an "irredenta"; but not all irredentas are necessarily involved in irredentism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/irredenta|title=Irredenta|publisher=Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common way to express a claim to adjacent territories on the grounds of historical or ethnic association is by using the adjective "Greater" as a prefix to the country name. This conveys the image of national territory at its maximum conceivable extent with the country "proper" at its core. The use of "Greater" does not always convey an irredentistic meaning.

{{split section|date=February 2018}}

===Afghanistan===

The [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] border with [[Pakistan]], known as the [[Durand Line]], was agreed to by Afghanistan and British India in 1893. The [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribes inhabiting the border areas were divided between what have become two nations; Afghanistan never accepted the still-porous border and clashes broke out in the 1950s and 1960s between Afghanistan and Pakistan over the issue. All Afghan governments of the past century have declared, with varying intensity, a long-term goal of re-uniting all Pashtun-dominated areas under Afghan rule.&lt;ref name="Roashan"&gt;[http://www.institute-for-afghan-studies.org/Contributions/Commentaries/DRRoashanArch/2001_08_11_unholy_durand_line.htm Dr. G.

===Argentina===
{{see also|Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute}}

The Argentine government has intermittently maintained a claim over the Falkland Islands (Malvinas, in Spanish) since 1833, and renewed it as recently as January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/03/world/europe/argentina-falklands-letter/index.html|title=Argentina presses claim to Falkland Islands, accusing UK of colonialism |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers the archipelago part of the [[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Tierra del Fuego Province]], along with [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].

===Bengal===
{{see also|Bengal|United Bengal}}
[[File:United Bengal.png|thumb|United Bengal]]
United Bengal is a political ideology of a Unified [[Bengali language|Bengali-speaking]] Nation in [[South Asia]]. The ideology was developed by [[Bengali nationalism|Bengali Nationalists]] after the First [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]] in 1905. The [[British Raj|British]]-ruled [[Bengal Presidency]] was divided into Western Bengal and [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] to weaken the Independence Movement; after much protest, [[Bengal]] was reunited in 1911.

The second attempt by British to partition the Bengal along communal lines was in 1947. The '''United Bengal''' proposal was the bid made by [[Prime Minister of Bengal]] [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]] and [[Bengalis|Bengali]] Nationalist Leader [[Sarat Chandra Bose]] to found a united and independent nation-state of [[Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Christophe Jaffrelot|title=A History of Pakistan and Its Origins|date=2004|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=9781843311492|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q9sI_Y2CKAcC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=sarat+Shaheed+Suhrawardy+plan#v=onepage&amp;q=sarat%20Shaheed%20Suhrawardy%20plan&amp;f=false|ref=scb1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scb2&gt;{{cite web|title=Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy : His Life|url=http://thedailynewnation.com/news/34685/huseyn-shaheed-suhrawardy--his-life.html|website=thedailynewnation.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was floated as an alternative to the [[1947 Partition of Bengal|partition of Bengal]] on [[Communalism|communal]] lines. The initiative failed due to British diplomacy and communal conflict between [[Bengali Muslims]] and [[Bengali Hindus]] that eventually led to the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Second Partition of Bengal]].

===Bolivia===
[[Image:BoliviaChile.jpg|thumb|200x|right|Bolivian irredentism over losses in the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1884): "What once was ours, will be ours once again", and "Hold on [[roto]]s (Chileans), because here come the Colorados of Bolivia"]]

The 2009 constitution of [[Bolivia]] states that the country has an "unrenounceable right over the territory that gives it access to the [[Pacific Ocean]] and its maritime space".&lt;ref&gt;CAPÍTULO CUARTO, REIVINDICACIÓN MARÍTIMA. Artículo 267. I. El Estado boliviano declara su derecho irrenunciable e imprescriptible sobre el territorio que le dé acceso al océano Pacífico y su espacio marítimo. II. La solución efectiva al diferendo marítimo a través de medios pacíficos y el ejercicio pleno de la soberanía sobre dicho territorio constituyen objetivos permanentes e irrenunciables del Estado boliviano.[http://www.presidencia.gob.bo/documentos/publicaciones/constitucion.pdf Constitution of Bolivia]&lt;/ref&gt; This is understood as territory that Bolivia and Peru ceded to Chile after the [[War of the Pacific]], which left Bolivia as a [[landlocked]] country.

===China===
{{main|Chinese Unification|Greater China}}
The preamble to the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] states, "[[Taiwan]] is part of the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China (PRC). It is the lofty duty of the entire [[Chinese people]], including our compatriots in Taiwan, to accomplish the great task of [[Chinese Unification|reunifying the motherland]]." The PRC claim to sovereignty over Taiwan is generally based on the theory of the [[succession of states]], with the PRC claiming that it is the successor state to the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]].&lt;ref name=prc_wp&gt;{{cite web|year=2005 |title=The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue |work=PRC Taiwan Affairs Office and the Information Office of the State Council |url=http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=WhitePaper&amp;title=White%20Papers%20On%20Taiwan%20Issue&amp;m_id=4 |accessdate=2006-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213045631/http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=WhitePaper&amp;title=White+Papers+On+Taiwan+Issue&amp;m_id=4 |archivedate=13 February 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It disregards the fact that the Qing Empire ceded Taiwan and the Pescadores to Japan in perpetuity in the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895.

The Government of the Republic of China formerly administered both mainland China and Taiwan; the government has been administering only Taiwan since its defeat in the [[Chinese Civil War]] by the armed forces of the [[Communist Party of China]]. While the official name of the state remains 'Republic of China', the country is commonly called 'Taiwan', since Taiwan makes up 99% of the controlled territory of the ROC.

Article 4 of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] originally stated that "[t]he territory of the Republic of China within its existing national boundaries shall not be altered except by a resolution of the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]]"&lt;ref&gt;The National Assembly abolished in 2005, which transfer power to the Legislative Yuan. The Legislative Yuan hold the power for decide to have a referendum about the changes of territory.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan maintained itself to be the legitimate ruler of Mainland China as well. As part of its current policy of continuing the 'status quo', the ROC has not renounced claims over the territories currently controlled by the People's Republic of China, [[Mongolia]], [[Russia]], [[Myanmar]] and some [[Central Asia]]n states. However, Taiwan does not actively pursue these claims in practice; the remaining claims that Taiwan is actively seeking are of uninhabited islands: the [[Senkaku Islands]], whose sovereignty is also asserted by [[Japan]] and the PRC; and the [[Paracel Islands]] and [[Spratly Islands]] in the [[South China Sea]], which are currently being developed by China (PRC).

===Comoros===
Article 1 of the Constitution of the Union of the [[Comoros]] begins: "The Union of the Comoros is a republic, composed of the autonomous islands of [[Mohéli]], [[Mayotte]], [[Anjouan]], and [[Grande Comore]]." Mayotte, geographically a part of the Comoro Islands, was the only island of the four to vote against independence from France (independence losing 37%–63%) in the referendum held December 22, 1974. Mayotte is currently a department of the French Republic.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly, [http://un.cti.depaul.edu/Countries/Comoros/1156245840.pdf Forty-ninth session: Agenda item 36] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527195255/http://un.cti.depaul.edu/Countries/Comoros/1156245840.pdf |date=May 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Security Council S/PV. 1888 para 247 S/11967 {{cite web |url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/membship/veto/vetosubj.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317010910/http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/membship/veto/vetosubj.htm |archivedate=2008-03-17 |df= }} {{cite web |url=http://legal.un.org/repertory/art33/english/rep_supp5_vol2-art33_e.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317010910/http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/membship/veto/vetosubj.htm |archivedate=2008-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{Main|Akhand Bharat|Indo-Pak Confederation}}
[[File:India disputed areas map.svg|thumb|Map showing disputed areas of [[India]]]]

All of the European colonies on the [[Indian subcontinent]] which were not part of the [[British Raj]] have been annexed by [[India]] since it gained its independence from the [[British Empire]]. An example of such territories was the 1961 [[Indian annexation of Goa]]. An example of annexation of a territory from the British Raj was the [[Indian integration of Junagadh]].

[[Akhand Bharat]], literally Undivided India or Whole India, is an irredentist call to reunite [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]] (and for some Sri Lanka, Maldives, Nepal and Bhutan) with [[India]] to form an ''Undivided India'' as it existed before [[Partition of India|partition]] in 1947 during the [[British Raj]] (and before that, during other periods of political unity in [[South Asia]] when most of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] was under the rule of one power, such as during the [[Maurya Empire]], the [[Gupta Empire]], the [[Chola Empire]] the [[Mughal Empire]] or the [[Maratha Empire]]). The call for ''Akhanda Bharata'' has often been raised by mainstream [[India]]n nationalistic cultural and political organizations such as the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP).&lt;ref name=Ferguson&gt;Yale H. Ferguson and R. J. Barry Jones, ''Political space: frontiers of change and governance in a globalizing world'', page 155, SUNY Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-5460-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Majumder&gt;Sucheta Majumder, "Right Wing Mobilization in India", ''Feminist Review'', issue 49, page 17, Routledge, 1995, {{ISBN|978-0-415-12375-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Martensson&gt;Ulrika Mårtensson and Jennifer Bailey, ''Fundamentalism in the Modern World'' (Volume 1), page 97, I.B.Tauris, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-84885-330-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major Indian political parties such as the [[Indian National Congress]], while maintaining positions against the partition of India on religious grounds, do not necessarily subscribe to a call to reunite South Asia in the form of Akhanda Bharata.

The region of [[Kashmir]] in north India has been the issue of a territorial dispute between India and Pakistan since 1947, the [[Kashmir conflict]]. Multiple wars have been fought over the issue, the first one immediately upon independence and partition in 1947 itself. To stave off a Pakistani and tribal invasion, [[Maharaja]] [[Hari Singh]] of the [[princely state]] of [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] signed the [[Instrument of Accession]] with India. Kashmir has remained divided in three parts, administered by India, Pakistan and [[China]], since then. However, on the basis of the instrument of accession, India continues to claim the entire Kashmir region as its integral part. All modern Indian political parties support the return of the entirety of Kashmir to India, and all official maps of India show the entire [[Jammu and Kashmir]] state (including parts under Pakistani or Chinese administration after 1947) as an integral part of India.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Indonesia===
{{Main|Greater Indonesia}}
[[File:Westpapua.png|thumb|[[Western New Guinea]] was annexed by Indonesia in 1969]]
Indonesia claimed all territories of the former [[Dutch East Indies]], and previously viewed British plans to group the [[British Malaya]] and [[British Borneo|Borneo]] into a new independent federation of [[Malaysia]] as a threat to its objective to create a united state called [[Greater Indonesia]]. The Indonesian opposition of Malaysian formation has led to the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]] in the early 1960s. It also held [[History of East Timor|Portuguese Timor]] (modern [[East Timor]]) from 1975 to 2002 based on irredentist claims.

The idea of uniting former British and Dutch colonial possessions in Southeast Asia actually has its roots in the early 20th century, as the concept of Greater Malay (''Melayu Raya'') was coined in [[British Malaya]] espoused by students and graduates of [[Sultan Idris Education University|Sultan Idris Training College for Malay Teachers]] in the late 1920s.&lt;ref name="McIntyre"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McIntyre|first=Angus|authorlink=|year=1973|title=The 'Greater Indonesia' Idea of Nationalism in Malaysia and Indonesia.|url=|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=7|issue=1|pages=75–83|doi=10.1017/S0026749X0000439X|id=}}&lt;!--|accessdate= 2008-02-16 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some political figures in Indonesia including [[Mohammad Yamin]] and [[Sukarno]] revived the idea in the 1950s and named the political union concept as Greater Indonesia.

===Israel===
{{Main|Israeli nationalism|Palestinian nationalism|Greater Israel}}
The nation state of Israel was established in 1948. The [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed U.N. Resolution 181, otherwise known as the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]], with 72% of the valid votes. Eventually, Israeli independence was achieved following the liquidation of the former British-administered Mandate of Palestine, the departure of the British and the "Independence War" between the Jews in ex-[[Mandatory Palestine]] and five Arab states' armies. The Jewish claim to Palestine as a [[Jewish homeland]] can be seen as an example of irredentist reclamation of what is considered lost Jewish land by Zionists. These claims are based on ancestral inhabitance (and in some periods sovereignty) in the land and the cultural/religious significance of it in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The latter is particularly relevant to the Israeli claim to Jerusalem. It should be noted that [[Mandatory Palestine]] had sizable [[History of the Jews in Palestine|Jewish]] and [[Palestinians|Arab]] populations before the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
[[Judea]] and [[Samaria]], as they are called in the Bible, were part of the ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] (designated the [[West Bank]] by Jordan in 1947) and the [[Gaza Strip]], previously annexed by Jordan and occupied by Egypt respectively, were conquered and occupied by Israel in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. Israel withdrew from Gaza in August 2005; Judea and Samaria (West Bank) remain under Israeli control. Israel has never explicitly claimed sovereignty over any part of the West Bank apart from [[East Jerusalem]], which it unilaterally annexed in 1980. However, the Israeli military supports and defends hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens who have [[Israeli settlements|migrated]] to the West Bank, incurring criticism by some who otherwise support Israel. The United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, and some countries and international organizations continue to regard Israel as occupying Gaza. ''(See [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli-Occupied Territories]])''

[[File:Israel and occupied territories map.png|thumb|Israel and [[Israeli-occupied territories]]]]
The Israeli annexing instrument, the [[Jerusalem Law]]—one of the [[Basic Laws of Israel]] (Israel does not have a constitution)—declares Jerusalem, "complete and united", to be the capital of Israel. Article 3 of the Basic Law of the [[Palestinian Authority]], which was ratified in 2002 by the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and serves as an interim constitution, claims that "[[Jerusalem]] is the capital of Palestine". ''De facto'', the Palestinian government administers the parts of the [[West Bank]] that Israel has granted it authority over from [[Ramallah]], while the [[Gaza Strip]] is administered by [[Hamas|the Hamas movement]] from [[Gaza City|Gaza]].

The United States has until now not recognized Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem and maintained its embassy in Tel Aviv. In Jerusalem, the United States maintained two Consulates General as a diplomatic representation to the city of Jerusalem alone, separate from representation to the state of Israel. One of the Consulates General was established before the 1967 war, and the other in a recently constructed building on the Israeli side of Jerusalem. Moreover, Congress passed the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]] in 1995 that says the US shall move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but allows the [[President of the United States|president]] to delay the move every year if it is deemed contrary to national security interests. Since 1995, every president delayed the move. However, President [[Donald Trump]] in December 2017 declared his intention to move the embassy to Jerusalem and by May 2018 the embassy will have officially moved to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mark Landler |date=6 December 2017 |title=Trump Recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's Capital and Orders U.S. Embassy to Move |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of Israelis and Jews regard the [[Transjordan (region)|East Bank of the Jordan river]] (which is today the [[Jordan|Kingdom of Jordan]]) as the eastern parts of the [[Land of Israel]] (following the [[Revisionist Zionism|revisionist]] idea) because, according to the Bible, the [[Tribes of Israel|Israelite tribes]] of [[Tribe of Manasseh|Menasseh]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], and [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]] settled on the east bank of the Jordan, and because that area was designated a [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish national home]] by the [[League of Nations]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]] based upon the recognized historical connection of the Jewish people to the land. Cited as an explicit basis not to create, but to reconstitute the historical homeland of the Jewish people as a nation-state roughly analogous to the former Kingdom of Israel subject to change by treaty, capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance or other lawful means, it forms a basis for claims of sovereign jurisdiction.

===Korea===
{{main|Korean reunification}}

Since their founding, both Korean states have disputed the legitimacy of the other. [[North Korea]]'s constitution stresses the importance of reunification, but, while it makes no similar formal provision for administering the South, it effectively claims its territory as it does not [[Diplomatic recognition|diplomatically recognise]] the Republic of Korea, deeming it an "entity occupying the Korean territory".

[[South Korea]]'s constitution also claims jurisdiction over the entire Korean peninsula. It acknowledges the [[division of Korea]] only indirectly by requiring the president to work for reunification. The [[Committee for the Five Northern Korean Provinces]], established in 1949, is the South Korean authority charged with the administration of Korean territory north of the [[Military Demarcation Line]] (i.e., North Korea), and consists of the governors of the five provinces, who are appointed by the [[President of the Republic of Korea|President]]. However the body is purely symbolic and largely tasked with dealing with Northern defectors; if reunification were to actually occur the Committee would be dissolved and new administrators appointed by the [[Ministry of Unification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/03/18/south-koreas-governors-in-theory-for-north-korea/|title=South Korea's Governors-in-Theory for North Korea|date=March 18, 2014|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other territories sometimes disputed to belong to Korea are [[Korean nationalism#Manchuria and Gando Disputes|Manchuria and Gando]].

=== Pakistan ===
Pakistan has from its inception sought to have the territory of Kashmir incorporated into it. This singular demand has predominated Pakistan's policy strategy and decision-making as well as its diplomacy, throughout its existence. Pakistan's dispute with India over the territory of Kashmir stems from events leading up to the 1948 war between the 2 countries.

=== Venezuela ===
{{main|Guayana Esequiba}}

The [[Guayana Esequiba]] is a territory administered by [[Guyana]] but claimed by [[Venezuela]]. It was first included in the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] and the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]] by [[Spain]], but was later included in [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] by the Dutch and in [[British Guiana]] by the [[United Kingdom]]. Originally, parts of what is now eastern Venezuela were included in the disputed area. This territory of {{Convert|159500|km2|abbr=on}} is the subject of a long-running boundary dispute inherited from the colonial powers and complicated by the independence of Guyana in 1966. The status of the territory is subject to the Treaty of Geneva, which was signed by the United Kingdom, Venezuela and British Guiana governments on February 17, 1966. This treaty stipulates that the parties will agree to find a practical, peaceful and satisfactory solution to the dispute.&lt;ref name=Geneva&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20561/volume-561-I-8192-English.pdf|title=Agreement to resolve the controversy over the frontier between Venezuela and British Guiana (Treaty of Geneva, 1966) |publisher= [[United Nations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bulgaria====
{{main|Greater Bulgaria}}

Based on the territorial definition of a historic Bulgarian state, a "[[Greater Bulgaria]]" nationalist movement has been active for more than a century that would annex most of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Thrace]], and [[Moesia]].

====France====
{{main|Natural borders of France}}

The idea of the natural borders of France is a political theory conceptualized primarily in the late 18th and early 19th centuries that focused on widening the borders primarily based on either practical reasons or the territory that was thought to be the maximum extent that the ancient Gauls inhabited. Under this theory France's eastern border would extend to the Rhine river and would require the annexation of Belgium, Luxembourg, 27,264&amp;nbsp;km² of German territory on the left bank of the Rhine river, and 10,545&amp;nbsp;km² of Dutch territory south of Waal and Merwede rivers. If implemented today France would increase its territory by 70,923&amp;nbsp;km² and increase its population by 25,170,400.

====Germany====
{{main|German Question|Pan-Germanism|Anschluss|Munich Agreement}}

During the debate of what was then called the [[German Question]] (''die deutsche Frage'') in the 19th century prior to the [[unification of Germany]] (1871), the term ''Großdeutschland'', "Greater Germany", referred to a possible German nation consisting of the states that later comprised the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria]]. The term ''Kleindeutschland'' "Lesser Germany" referred to a possible German state without Austria. The term was later used by Germans referring to Greater Germany, a state consisting of pre–World War I Germany, Austria and the [[Sudetenland]].

A main point of [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]] was to reunify all Germans either born or living outside of Germany to create an "all-German [[Reich]]". These beliefs ultimately resulted in the Munich Agreement, which ceded to Germany [[The Sudetenland|areas of Czechoslovakia]] that were mainly inhabited by those of German descent, and the ''[[Anschluss]]'', which ceded the entire country of Austria to Germany; both events occurred in 1938.

====Greece====
{{Main|Megali Idea}}

Following the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821–1832, [[Greece]] began to contest areas inhabited by Greeks, primarily against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) envisioned Greek incorporation of Greek-inhabited lands, but also historical lands in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] corresponding with the predominantly Greek and Orthodox [[Byzantine Empire]] and the dominions of the ancient Greeks.
[[File:Territorial Expansion of Greece from 1832–1947.gif|thumb|Territorial evolution of modern Greece]]
The Greek quest began with the acquisition of [[Thessaly]] through the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)|Convention of Constantinople in 1881]], [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|a failed war against Turkey in 1897]] and the [[Balkan Wars]] ([[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], some [[Aegean Islands]]). After World War I, Greece acquired [[Western Thrace]] from [[Bulgaria]] as per the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]], but also [[Ionia]]/[[İzmir|Smyrna]] and [[East Thrace|Eastern Thrace]] (excluding [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]) from the Ottoman Empire as ordained in the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]. Subsequently, Greece launched an [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)|unsuccessful campaign]] to further their gains in Asia Minor, but were halted by the [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish revolution]]. The events culminated into the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]], [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] and [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] which returned Eastern Thrace and Ionia to the newfound Turkish Republic. The events are known as the "Asia Minor Catastrophe" to Greeks. The [[Ionian Islands]] were ceded by Britain in 1864, and the [[Dodecanese]] by Italy in 1947.

Another concern of the Greeks is the [[Enosis|incorporation of Cyprus]] which was ceded by the Ottomans to [[British Cyprus (1878–1960)|the British]]. As a result of the [[Cyprus Emergency]] the island gained independence as the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] in 1960. The failed incorporation by Greece through [[1974 Cypriot coup d'état|coup d'état]] and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 led to the formation of the mostly unrecognized [[Northern Cyprus]] and has culminated into the present-day [[Cyprus dispute|Cyprus issue]].

The Aegean islands of [[Imbros and Tenedos]] which were not ceded to Greece over the course of the 20th century and where the dominant Greek community has faced persecution are also of concern.

====Hungary====

====Ireland====
[[File:Ireland-Capitals.PNG|thumb|left|Political map of Ireland, showing the state of Ireland and Northern Ireland]]
{{main|United Ireland|Partition of Ireland|Irish republican legitimism}}
The [[Irish Free State]] achieved independence from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1922. This state did not include [[Northern Ireland]], which comprised six counties in the north-east of the island of [[Ireland]] which remained in the United Kingdom. The [[Constitution of Ireland]] adopted in 1937 provided that the name of the state is ''Ireland'' and [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Articles 2 and 3]] provided that "[t]he national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland", while stipulating that "[p]ending the re-integration of the national territory", the powers of the state were restricted to legislate only for the area which had formed part of the [[Irish Free State]]. Arising from the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], the matter was mutually resolved as part of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s constitution was altered by [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|referendum]] and its territorial claim to [[Northern Ireland]] was removed. The amended constitution asserts that while it is the entitlement of "every person born in the island of Ireland … to be part of the Irish Nation" and to hold Irish citizenship, "a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island". A [[North/South Ministerial Council]] was created between the two jurisdictions and given executive authority. The advisory and consultative role of the government of Ireland in the government of Northern Ireland granted by the United Kingdom, that had begun with the 1985 [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], was maintained, although that Agreement itself was ended. The two states also settled the long-running [[Names of the Irish state|dispute concerning their respective names]]: ''Ireland'' and the ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'', with both governments agreeing to use those names.

Under the [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] theory of [[Irish republican legitimism|legitimism]], the [[Irish Republic]] declared in 1916 was in existence from then on, denying the legitimacy of either the state of Ireland or the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Through much of its [[history of Sinn Féin|history]], this was the position of [[Sinn Féin]]; however, it effectively abandoned this stance after accepting the Good Friday Agreement. Small groups which split from Sinn Féin continue to adopt this stance, including [[Republican Sinn Féin]], linked with the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]], and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]], linked with the [[Real Irish Republican Army|Real IRA]].

====Italy====
[[File:RegioniIrredenteItalia.jpg|thumb|Italian territory claims by Italian irredentism activists in the 1930s.]]
{{main|Italian irredentism|Italian Empire}}

Italy's territorial claims were on the basis of re-establishing a Romanesque Empire, a fourth shore according to the concept of Mare Nostrum (Latin for 'Our Sea') and traditional ethnic borders. Evident in Italy's rapid takeover of surrounding territories under Fascist leader Benito Mussolini and claims following the collapsed 1915 [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] and 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] which established feelings of betrayal. Similar to the Nazis' stab-in-the-back myth, Mussolini and Hitler's similarities including a joint hatred towards the French and wanting to expand their territories brought the two leaders together, solidified in the [[Pact of Steel]] and later WW2. By 1942 Italy had conquered Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia), Libya, Much of Egypt, Tunisia, Kenya and Somalia. And – on the European continent – Istria, Dalmatia, Albania, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, the Spanish island of Majorca and France's Corsica; Malta was also bombed. Underlying tensions remained with France, over its territories of Corsica, Nice and Savoy.

====Republic of Macedonia====
{{main|United Macedonia}}{{see also|Macedonian nationalism}}

Some Macedonian nationalists promoted the irredentist concept of a [[United Macedonia]] ({{lang-mk|Обединета Македонија|translit=Obedineta Makedonija}}) among [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] [[nationalism|nationalists]], which involves territorial claims on the northern province of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] in [[Greece]], but also in [[Blagoevgrad Province]] ("Pirin Macedonia") in Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia. The United Macedonia concept aims to unify the transnational [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] in the [[Balkans]] (which they claim as their homeland and which they assert was wrongfully divided under the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]] in 1913), into a single state under Macedonian domination, with the [[Greece|Greek]] city of [[Thessaloniki]] (''Solun'' in the [[Slavic languages]]) as its capital.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;Greek Macedonia "not a problem", ''The Times'' (London), August 5, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|t2GMihoOmF8|A large assembly of people during the inauguration of the Statue of Alexander the Great in Skopje}}, {{YouTube|Kh25jfXxY2w|the players of the national basketball team of the Republic of Macedonia during the European Basketball Championship in Lithuania}}, {{YouTube|97ucJP97Sto|and a little girl}}, singing a nationalistic tune called Izlezi Momče (Излези момче, "Get out boy").

Raise your hands up high

====Norway====
{{main|Kingdom of Norway (872–1397)}}
[[File:Norway About 1265.png|thumb|The [[Kingdom of Norway]] at its greatest extent.]]

The Kingdom of [[Norway]] maintains some claim to territories lost at the dissolution of the [[Denmark–Norway]] union{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}. The [[Kingdom of Norway (872–1397)]], which was the Norwegian territories at its maximum extent, included [[Iceland]], the settleable areas of [[Greenland]], the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Shetland]] among others. Under Danish sovereignty since they established a hegemonic position in the [[Kalmar Union]], the territories were considered as Norwegian colonies. When in the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814, Norway's territories were transferred from [[Denmark]] to [[Sweden]], the territories of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands were maintained by Denmark. In 1919, Norway declared sovereignty over an area in Eastern Greenland in the [[Ihlen Declaration]], which led to a dispute with Denmark that was not settled until 1933, by the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]. Norway formerly included the provinces [[Jämtland]], [[Härjedalen]], [[Idre]], [[Särna]] (lost since the [[Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645)|Second Treaty of Brömsebro]]), and [[Bohuslän]] (lost since the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]), which were ceded to Sweden after Danish defeats in wars such as the [[Thirty Years' War]] and [[Second Northern War]].

====Poland====
{{See also|Polish nationalism|Kresy}}

[[Kresy]] ("Borderlands") are the eastern lands that formerly belonged to [[Poland]]. In 1921, Polish troops crossed the [[Curzon Line]], the border between ethnic Polish and ethnic Ukrainian and Belorussian territories, and [[Kiev Offensive (1920)|seized large Ukrainian and Belorussian territories]], and also [[Żeligowski's Mutiny|seized 7 percent of Lithuania's territory in 1920]]. These territories were re-annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1939 under the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]], and include major cities, like [[Lviv]] (Ukraine), [[Vilnius]] (the capital of Lithuania), and [[Hrodna]] (Belarus). Even though ''Kresy'', or the ''Eastern Borderlands'', are no longer Polish territories, the area is still inhabited by a significant Polish minority, and the memory of a Polish ''Kresy'' is still cultivated. The attachment to the "myth of Kresy", the vision of the region as a peaceful, idyllic, rural land, has been criticized in Polish discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/51,97863,7751751.html?i=0Czas|title=odczarować mit Kresów Czas odczarować mit Kresów Marcin Wojciechowski, Gazeta Wyborcza 2010-04-12, |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January, February and March 2012, the [[Centre for Public Opinion Research]] conducted a survey, asking Poles about their ties to the Kresy. It turned out that almost 15% of the population of Poland (4.3–4.6 million people) declared that they had either been born in the Kresy, or had a parent or a grandparent who came from that region. Numerous treasures of Polish culture remain and there are numerous Kresy-oriented organizations. There are Polish sports clubs ([[Pogoń Lwów (2009)|Pogoń Lwów]], [[FK Polonia Vilnius]]), newspapers ([[Gazeta Lwowska]], [[Kurier Wileński]]), radio stations (in Lviv and Vilnius), numerous theatres, schools, choirs and folk ensembles. Poles living in ''Kresy'' are helped by [[Fundacja Pomoc Polakom na Wschodzie]], a Polish government-sponsored organization, as well as other organizations, such as The ''Association of Help of Poles in the East Kresy'' (see also [[Karta Polaka]]). Money is frequently collected to help those Poles who live in ''Kresy'', and there are several annual events, such as a ''Christmas Package for a Polish Veteran in Kresy'', and ''Summer with Poland'', sponsored by the [[Association "Polish Community"]], in which Polish children from ''Kresy'' are invited to visit Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzienniklodzki.pl/wakacje/432777,dzieci-z-kresow-zwiedzaja-lodz-zdjecia,id,t.html|title=Dzieci z Kresów zwiedzają Łódź [ZDJĘCIA]|first=Michał|last=Meksa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish language handbooks and films, as well as medicines and clothes are collected and sent to ''Kresy''. Books are most often sent to Polish schools which exist there&amp;nbsp;— for example, in December 2010, The University of Wrocław organized an event called ''Become a Polish Santa Claus and Give a Book to a Polish Child in Kresy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksiazka.net.pl/index.php?id=4&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=6825&amp;cHash=0882d0da2f|title=Wiadomości i informacje o książkach i wszelkich przejawach kultury książki |publisher=Portal Księgarski}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish churches and cemeteries (such as [[Cemetery of the Defenders of Lwów]]) are renovated with money from Poland.

====Portugal====
{{main|Olivenza#Claims of sovereignty|Greater Portugal}}

[[Portugal]] does not recognize Spanish sovereignty over the territory of [[Olivenza]], ceded to Spain during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/eterna/disputa/Olivenza-Olivenca/elpepunac/20061204elpepinac_13/Tes |title=La eterna disputa de Olivenza-Olivença &amp;#124; Edición impresa &amp;#124; EL PAÍS |publisher=Elpais.com |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Rexurdimento]] of the mid-nineteenth century, there has been an intellectual [[Reintegrationism|movement pleading for the reintegration]] between [[Portugal]] and the region of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. Although this movement has become increasingly popular on both sides of the border, there is no consensus in regard to the nature of such ''reintegration'': whether political, socio-cultural or merely linguistic.

====Romania====
{{Main|Greater Romania|Unification of Romania and Moldova}}

Romania lays claims to Greater Romania, which include [[Bessarabia]] and [[Bucovina]] as [[Moldova]], since they were parts of Romania between 1918 and 1940, and are still inhabited for the most by Romanians. Moldovans are ethnically Romanians, and the [[Moldovan language]] is the Soviet name for the [[Romanian language]]. There is some (but not universal) support by Moldovans for a peaceful and voluntary reunion with Romania, not least because (having joined the [[European Union]]), the economy has burgeoned and Romanian citizens have gained freedom of movement in Europe. Also Russian irredentism in [[Transnistria]] has caused alarm and resentment.

====Russia====
[[File:2014 Russo-ukrainian-conflict map.svg|thumb|[[Crimea]], which is under Russian control, is shown in pink. Pink in the [[Donbass]] area represents areas held by pro-Russian [[Separatism|separatists]] in September 2014]]
{{Main|Russian irredentism}}
{{See also|Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}
The [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] in 2014 was based on a claim of protecting [[Ethnic Russians in post-Soviet states|ethnic Russians]] residing there. Crimea was part of the [[Russian Empire]] from 1783 to 1917, after which it enjoyed a few years of autonomy until it was made part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (which was a part of the Soviet Union) from 1921 to 1954 and then [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] to [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]] (which also was a part of the Soviet Union) in 1954. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Crimea still remained part of Ukraine until February 2014. Russia declared Crimea to be part of the Russian Federation in March 2014, and effective administration commenced. The Russian regional status is not currently recognised by the UN General Assembly and by many countries.

Russian irredentism also includes southeastern and coastal Ukraine, known as ''[[Novorossiya]]'', a term from the Russian Empire.

====Serbia====
 {{main|Greater Serbia}} [[File:Serbs in Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Serbia, 1981.png|thumb|The distribution of Serbs and Montenegrins in Yugoslavia (except Macedonia and Slovenia) in 1981.]]
Serbian irredentism is manifested in "[[Greater Serbia]]". Used in the context of the [[Yugoslav wars]], however, the Serbian struggle for Serbs to remain united in one country does not quite fit the term "irredentism".&lt;ref name="Thomas2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Raju G.C Thomas|title=The South Slav Conflict: History, Religion, Ethnicity, and Nationalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNngAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA220|date=23 June 2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-135-59717-7|pages=220–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, Pan-Serbism sought to unite all of the Serb people across the Balkans, under Ottoman and Habsburg rule. Some intellectuals sought to unite all South Slavs (regardless of religion) into a Serbian state. [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] had gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878. Bosnia and Herzegovina, annexed by the Austrians in 1908, was viewed of as a part of the Serbian homeland. Serbia directed its territorial aspirations to the south, as the north and west was held by Austria. Macedonia was divided between Serbia and Greece after the [[Balkan Wars]]. In 1914 aspirations were directed towards Austria-Hungary. A government policy sought to incorporate all Serb-inhabited areas, and other South Slavic areas, thereby laying the foundation of [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="Danver2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven L.

The project of unification of Serb-inhabited areas in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Yugoslav wars (see [[United Serb Republic]]) ultimately failed. The Croatian [[Operation Storm]] ended large-scale combat and captured most of the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] forcing almost complete Serbian population to leave their centuries-old homeland, while the [[Dayton Agreement]] ended the Bosnian War. Bosnia and Herzegovina was established as a federal republic, made up by two separate entities, one being Serb-inhabited [[Republika Srpska]]. There has since been calls by Bosnian Serb politicians for the [[Proposed secession of Republika Srpska|secession of Republika Srpska]], and possible unification with Serbia.

After the [[Kosovo War]] (1998–99), Kosovo became a [[UNSCR 1244|UN protectorate]], still ''de jure'' part of Serbia. The Albanian-majority Kosovo assembly unilaterally declared the independence of Kosovo in 2008, and [[Political status of Kosovo|its status is since disputed]].

====Spain====
{{further|Spanish irredentism|Spanish nationalism|Disputed status of Gibraltar}}

Spain maintains a claim on [[Gibraltar]], a [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] near the southernmost tip of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], which has been British since the 18th Century.

Gibraltar was [[Capture of Gibraltar|captured in 1704]], during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–1714). The [[Kingdom of Spain]] formally ceded the territory in perpetuity to the British Crown in 1713, under [[:s:Peace and Friendship Treaty of Utrecht between Spain and Great Britain#ARTICLE X|Article X]] of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. Spain's territorial claim was formally reasserted by the Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] in the 1960s and has been continued by successive [[Government of Spain|Spanish governments]]. In 2002 an agreement in principle on joint sovereignty over [[Gibraltar]] between the governments of the United Kingdom and Spain was decisively rejected in a [[Gibraltar sovereignty referendum, 2002|referendum]]. The British Government now refuses to discuss sovereignty without the consent of the Gibraltarians.&lt;ref name="Answer to Q257 at the FAC hearing"&gt;{{cite web|author=The Committee Office, House of Commons |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmfaff/147/8032602.htm |title=Answer to Q257 at the FAC hearing |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irredentism is acute in the Caucasus region.

When the Caucuses came under the rule of the [[Soviet Union]], the land was given to Azerbaijan abruptly and arbitrarily due to pressure by [[Joseph Stalin]], along with the ancient Armenian lands of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]], to appease Turkey during 1919-1921.
Azerbaijan's irredentism, on the other hand, is quite explicit in official statements of the Azerbaijani officials by claiming the UN member-state Republic of Armenia as Azerbaijani territory despite the absence of historical evidence of Azerbaijan existing as a separate state up until 1918. On his official meeting in [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Gyanja]] on 21 January 2014, President [[Ilham Aliyev]] said in particular, "The present-day Armenia is actually located on historical lands of Azerbaijan.

====Iran====
{{main|Pan-Iranism|Greater Iran}}
[[Pan-Iranism]] is an [[ideology]] that advocates solidarity and reunification of [[Iranian people]]s living in the [[Iranian plateau]] and other regions that have significant Iranian cultural influence, including the [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Azerbaijanis]], [[Ossetians]], [[Kurds]], [[Zazas]], [[Tajiks]] of [[Tajikistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], the [[Pashtuns]] and the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] of [[Pakistan]]. The first theoretician was Dr Mahmoud Afshar Yazdi.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Richard Frye states: The Turkish speakers of Azerbaijan are mainly descended from the earlier Iranian speakers, several pockets of whom still exist in the region (Frye, Richard Nelson, "Peoples of Iran", in Encyclopedia Iranica).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Swietochowski, Tadeusz]]. "AZERBAIJAN, REPUBLIC OF", Vol. 3, Colliers Encyclopedia CD-ROM, 02-28-1996: "The original Persian population became fused with the Turks, and gradually the Persian language was supplanted by a Turkic dialect that evolved into the distinct Azerbaijani language."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golden, P.B. "An Introduction to the History of the Turkic Peoples", Otto Harrosowitz, 1992. "The Azeris of today are an overwhelmingly sedentary, detribalized people. Anthropologically, they are little distinguished from the Iranian neighbor"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Planhol, ""Lands of Iran” in Encyclopedia Iranica. Excerpt: The toponyms, with more than half of the place names of Iranian origin in some areas, such as the Sahand, a huge volcanic massif south of Tabriz, or the Qara Dagh, near the border (Planhol, 1966, p. 305; Bazin, 1982, p. 28) bears witness to this continuity. The language itself provides eloquent proof. Azeri, not unlike Uzbek (see above), lost the vocal harmony typical of Turkish languages. It is a Turkish language learned and spoken by Iranian peasants."(Encyclopedia Iranica, "Lands of Iran")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Thus Turkish nomads, in spite of their deep penetration throughout Iranian lands, only slightly influenced the local culture. Elements borrowed by the Iranians from their invaders were negligible."(X.D. Planhol, LANDS OF IRAN in Encyclopedia Iranica)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;История Востока. В 6 т. Т. 2. Восток в средние века. Глава V. — М.: «Восточная литература», 2002. — {{ISBN|5-02-017711-3}}. Excerpt: "Говоря о возникновении азербайджанской культуры именно в XIV-XV вв., следует иметь в виду прежде всего литературу и другие части культуры, органически связанные с языком. Что касается материальной культуры, то она оставалась традиционной и после тюркизации местного населения. Впрочем, наличие мощного пласта иранцев, принявших участие в формировании азербайджанского этноса, наложило свой отпечаток прежде всего на лексику азербайджанского языка, в котором огромное число иранских и арабских слов. Последние вошли и в азербайджанский, и в турецкий язык главным образом через иранское посредство. Став самостоятельной, азербайджанская культура сохранила тесные связи с иранской и арабской. Они скреплялись и общей религией, и общими культурно-историческими традициями."

Misak-ı Millî is the set of six important decisions made by the last term of the [[Ottoman Parliament]]. Parliament met on 28 January 1920 and published their decisions on 12 February 1920. These decisions worried the occupying [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], resulting in the [[Occupation of Constantinople]] by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]], [[French Third Republic|French]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italian]] troops on 16 March 1920 and the establishment of a new [[Turkish National Movement|Turkish nationalist]] parliament, the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Grand National Assembly]], in [[Ankara Government|Ankara]].

The Ottoman Minister of Internal Affairs, [[Damat Ferid Pasha]], made the opening speech of parliament due to [[Mehmed VI]]'s illness. A group of parliamentarians called ''Felâh-ı Vatan'' was established by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]]'s friends to acknowledge the decisions taken at the [[Erzurum Congress]] and the [[Sivas Congress]]. Mustafa Kemal said "It is the nation's iron fist that writes the Nation's Oath which is the main principle of our independence to the annals of history." Decisions taken by this parliament were used as the basis for the new [[Turkish Republic]]'s claims in the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

Japan also claims the [[South Korea]]n-administered [[Liancourt Rocks dispute|Liancourt Rocks]], which are known as Takeshima in Japan and have been claimed since the end of the Second World War.

====Korea====
The 1909 [[Gando Convention]] addressed a territory dispute between China and [[Joseon Korea]] in China's favour. Both Korean states now accept the convention border as an administrative boundary. However, because the convention was made by the occupying [[Empire of Japan]], [[South Korea]] has disputed its legality and some Koreans claim that Korea extends into ''de facto'' PRC territory, viz.

====Bangladesh====
{{Main|Greater Bangladesh}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}

Greater Bangladesh is an assumption of several Indian intellectuals that the neighbouring country of Bangladesh has an aspiration to unite all Bengali dominated regions under their flag. These include the states of [[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]] and [[Assam]] as well as the [[Andaman Islands]] which are currently part of India and the Burmese [[Rakhine State|State of Rakhine]]. The theory is principally based on a widespread belief amongst Indian masses that a large number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants reside in Indian territory. It is alleged that illegal immigration is actively encouraged by some political groups in Bangladesh as well as the state of Bangladesh to convert large parts of India's northeastern states and West Bengal into Muslim-majority areas that would subsequently seek to separate from India and join Muslim-majority Bangladesh. Scholars have reflected that under the guise of anti-Bangladeshi immigrant movement it is actually an anti-Muslim agenda pointed towards Bangladeshi Muslims by false propaganda and widely exaggerated claims on immigrant population. In 1998, Lieutenant General S.K. Sinha, then the Governor of Assam, claimed that massive illegal immigration from Bangladesh was directly linked with "the long-cherished design of Greater Bangladesh".

===Africa===
Irredentism is commonplace in [[Africa]] due to the political boundaries of former European colonial nation-states passing through ethnic boundaries, and recent declarations of independence after civil war. For example, some Ethiopian nationalist circles still claim the former Ethiopian province of [[Eritrea]] (internationally recognized as the independent State of Eritrea in 1993 after a 30-year civil war).

====North Africa====
In North Africa, the prime examples of irredentism are the concepts of [[Greater Morocco]] and [[Greater Mauritania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bundesheer.at/pdf_pool/publikationen/hasa03.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While Mauritania has since relinquished any claims to territories [[Tiris al-Gharbiyya|outside its internationally recognized borders]], Morocco continues to occupy much of [[Western Sahara]], which it refers to as its "[[Southern Provinces]]".

====Somalia====
{{main|Greater Somalia}}
[[File:Somali map.jpg|thumb|Estimated ethnic Somali territory in relation to neighbouring countries.The area is roughly coextensive with [[Greater Somalia]].]]

Greater Somalia refers to the region in the Horn of Africa in which [[Somalis|ethnic Somalis]] are and have historically represented the predominant population. The territory encompasses The Republic of Somalia, the Ogaden region in Ethiopia, the North Eastern Province in Kenya and southern and eastern Djibouti. [[Ogaden]] in eastern Ethiopia has seen military and civic movements seeking to make it part of [[Somalia]]. This culminated in the 1977–78 [[Ogaden War]] between the two neighbours where the Somali military offensive between July 1977 and March 1978 over the disputed Ethiopian region Ogaden ended when the Somali Armed Forces retreated back across the border and a truce was declared. The Kenyan [[Northern Frontier District]] also saw conflict during the [[Shifta War]] (1963–1967) when a secessionist conflict in which ethnic Somalis in the [[Lamu County|Lamu]], [[Garissa County|Garissa]], [[Wajir County|Wajir]] and [[Mandera County|Mandera]] [[Counties of Kenya|counties]] (all except [[Lamu County|Lamu]] formed part of the former [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]], abolished in 2013), attempted to join with their fellow Somalis in a "[[Greater Somalia]]". There has been no similar conflicts in Djibouti, which was previously known as the "[[French Somaliland]]" during colonisation. Here the apparent struggles for unification manifested itself in political strife that ended when in a referendum to join France as opposed to the Somali Republic succeeded among rumours of widespread [[vote rigging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Africa Research Bulletin, Volume 3|author=Africa Research, Ltd|date=1966|publisher=Blackwell|page=597|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=42oEAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent death of Somali nationalist [[Mahmoud Harbi]], Vice President of the Government Council, who was killed in a plane crash two years later under suspicious circumstances.&lt;ref name=Barrington2006&gt;Barrington, Lowell, ''After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States'', (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cortina Troubles|Cortina]] and [[Bandit War|Pizaña uprisings]] of 1859 and 1915 were influenced by irredentist ideas and the "proximity of the international boundary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Folklore and Culture on the Texas-Mexican Border|author=Américo Paredes|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=1993|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unsuccessful Pizaña uprising "was the last major armed protest on the part of Texas-Americans" ([[Tejano]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Texas-Mexican Cancionero: Folksongs of the Lower Border|author=Américo Paredes|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=1976|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 1915 uprising and the [[Plan of San Diego]] that preceded it marked the high point in Mexican irredentist sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=More Than a Century of the Chicano Movement|author=Leo Cervantes|publisher=Orbis Press|year=2004|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lost Land: The Chicano Image of the Southwest|author=John R.

In the early years of the [[Chicano Movement]] (''El Movimiento'') in the 1960s and 1970s, some movement figures "were political nationalists who advocated the secession of the Southwest from the [[Anglo]] republic of the United States of America, if not fully, at least locally with regard to Chicano self-determination in local governance, education and means of production".&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patricia L.

'''Ismara''' ({{lang-grc|Ἴσμαρος}}, ''Ismaros'' {{IPA-el|ismaros|}}) is a city of the [[Cicones]], mentioned in the ''[[Odyssey]]''.

==Homeric Ismaros==
After their departure from [[Troy]], [[Odysseus]] and his companions stop at Ismaros.&lt;ref&gt;''The Essential Homer: Selections from the Iliad and the Odyssey'' by Homer and Stanley Lombardo, page 299: "... From Ilion the wind took me to the Cicones In Ismaros. I pillaged the town and killed the men."&lt;/ref&gt; They sack the town, and attack the Cicones, the inhabitants of the adjacent region. They kill the men and divide the women and treasures among themselves, then begin to feast, despite Odysseus' advice that they leave immediately. The Cicones, who have left in search of help, come back in the morning in great numbers. Odysseus manages to escape, although he loses several men in the process. He embarks with the survivors and continues his journey home to [[Homer's Ithaca|Ithaca]].

While at Ismaros, Odysseus spares Maron, the son of Euanthes and the priest of Apollo, and his family. Because of this, Maron gifts him a "goatskin bottle of black wine", some gold, and a mixing bowl. The wine was a strong and divine drink, as for each cup of wine, 20 times as much water was added to it to dilute it. He uses this wine to lull the [[Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]] to sleep.&lt;ref name="Homer 2007 p. 142"&gt;{{cite book | author=Homer | title=The odyssey of Homer | publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics | publication-place=New York, NY | year=2007 | isbn=0-06-124418-X | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creature is often described as a flying [[Bipedalism|biped]] with [[hoof|hooves]], but there are many variations. The common description is that of a [[kangaroo]]-like or [[wyvern]]-like creature with a [[goat]]- or [[horse]]-like head, leathery [[bat]]-like [[wings]], [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]], small arms with clawed hands, cloven hooves and a forked tail. It has been reported to move quickly and often is described as emitting a "blood-curdling scream".&lt;ref name=mccloy&gt;''The Jersey Devil'', by James F.

==Origin of the legend==
[[File:Historic American Buildings Survey Nathaniel R. Ewan, Photographer May 7, 1937 EXTERIOR- WEST VIEW - Japhet Leeds House, Moss Mill Road, Leeds Point, Atlantic County, NJ HABS NJ,1-LEEPO,1-1.tif|thumb|left|Japhet Leeds House, Moss Mill Road, Leeds Point, Atlantic County, NJ (c.1937)]]

===Mother Leeds' 13th child===
According to popular folklore, the Jersey Devil originated with a Pine Barrens resident named Jane Leeds, known as Mother Leeds. The legend states that Mother Leeds had 12 children and, after finding she was pregnant for the 13th time, cursed the child in frustration, crying that the child would be the [[devil]]. During 1735, Mother Leeds was in labor on a stormy night while her friends gathered around her. Born as a normal child, the thirteenth child changed to a creature with hooves, a goat's head, bat wings, and a forked tail. Growling and screaming, it killed the [[midwife]] before flying up the chimney and heading into the pines. In some versions of the tale, Mother Leeds was supposedly a [[witch]] and the child's father was the devil himself. Some versions of the legend also state that there was subsequently an attempt by local clergymen to [[exorcise]] the creature from the Pine Barrens, or that the creature proceeded to kill local children.&lt;ref name=regal/&gt;

===The Leeds family===
Prior to the early 1900s, and before the series of reported sightings of the creature during 1909, the Jersey Devil was referred to as the '''Leeds Devil''' or the "Devil of Leeds", either in connection with the local Leeds family or the eponymous southern New Jersey town, [[Leeds Point, New Jersey|Leeds Point]].&lt;ref name=courier/&gt;

"Mother Leeds" has been identified by some as Deborah Leeds,&lt;ref&gt;Mallowe, Mike, "The Enduring Reign Of The Jersey Devil" ''The Bulletin'' (Philadelphia), October 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; on grounds that Deborah Leeds' husband, Japhet Leeds, named twelve children in the will he wrote during 1736,&lt;ref&gt;''Documents Relating to the Colonial History of the State Of New Jersey'', 1st Ser., Vol. XXX Ed. A. Van Doren Honeyman, (Union-Gazette, Somerville, N.J.)1918.&lt;/ref&gt; which is compatible with the legend. Deborah and Japhet Leeds also lived in the [[Leeds Point, New Jersey|Leeds Point]] section of what is now [[Atlantic County, New Jersey]],&lt;ref&gt;Rundstrom, Olive Conover, "Daniel Leeds and his Descendants", ''Atlantic County Historical Society Year Book'', vol. 6, no. 4, p. 156 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; which is commonly the location of the Jersey Devil story.

[[Brian Regal]], a [[History of Science|historian of science]] at [[Kean University]], theorizes that the story of Mother Leeds, rather than being based on a single historical person, originated from colonial southern New Jersey religio-political disputes that became the subject of folklore and gossip among the local population. According to Regal, folk legends concerning these historical disputes evolved through the years and ultimately resulted in the modern popular legend of the Jersey Devil during the early 20th century. Regal contends that "colonial-era political intrigue" involving early New Jersey politicians, [[Benjamin Franklin]], and Franklin's rival almanac publisher Daniel Leeds (1651–1720) resulted in the Leeds family being described as "monsters", and it was Daniel Leeds' negative description as the "Leeds Devil", rather than any actual creature, that created the later legend of the Jersey Devil.

Much like the Mother Leeds of the Jersey Devil myth, Daniel Leeds' third wife had given birth to nine children, a large number of children even for the time. Leeds' second wife and first daughter had both died during childbirth. As a royal [[surveyor]] with strong allegiance to the [[British crown]], Leeds had also surveyed and acquired land in the [[Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey|Egg Harbor]] area, located within the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|Pine Barrens]]. The land was inherited by Leeds' sons and family and is now known as Leeds Point, one of the areas in the Pine Barrens currently most associated with the Jersey Devil legend and alleged Jersey Devil sightings.&lt;ref name=regal&gt;Regal, Brian. (2013). [http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_jersey_devil_the_real_story/ "The Jersey Devil: The Real Story"]. Csicop.org. Retrieved 2015-05-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 17th century, [[English people|English]] [[Quaker]]s established settlements in southern New Jersey, the region in which the Pine Barrens are located. Daniel Leeds, a Quaker and a prominent person of pre-Revolution colonial southern New Jersey, became ostracized by his Quaker congregation after his 1687 publication of [[almanac]]s containing [[astrology|astrological]] symbols and writings. Leeds' fellow Quakers deemed the astrology in these almanacs as too "[[pagan]]" or blasphemous, and the almanacs were censored and destroyed by the local Quaker community.

In response to and in spite of this censorship, Leeds continued to publish even more [[esoteric]] astrological Christian writings and became increasingly fascinated with [[Occult|Christian occultism]], [[Christian mysticism]], [[cosmology]], [[demonology]] and [[angelology]], and [[natural magic]]. By the 1690s, after his almanacs and writings were further censored as blasphemous or [[heretical]] by the [[Philadelphia Yearly Meeting|Philadelphia Quaker Meeting]], Leeds continued to dispute with the Quaker community, converting to [[Anglicanism]] and publishing anti-Quaker [[Tract (literature)|tract]]s criticizing Quaker theology and accusing Quakers of being [[anti-monarchism|anti-monarchist]]s. In the ensuing dispute between Leeds and the southern New Jersey Quakers over Leeds' accusations, Leeds was endorsed by the much-maligned British royal governor of New Jersey, [[Lord Cornbury]], despised among the Quaker communities. Leeds also worked as a councilor to Lord Cornbury about this time. Considering Leeds as a traitor for aiding the Crown and rejecting Quaker beliefs, the Quaker Burlington Meeting of southern New Jersey subsequently dismissed Leeds as "[[evil]]".&lt;ref name=regal/&gt;

During 1716, Daniel Leeds' son, Titan Leeds, inherited his father's almanac business, which continued to use astrological content and eventually competed with [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s popular ''[[Poor Richard's Almanac]]''. The competition between the two men intensified when, during 1733, Franklin satirically used astrology in his almanac to predict Titan Leeds' death on October of that same year. Though Franklin's prediction was intended as a joke at his competitor's expense and a means to boost almanac sales, Titan Leeds was apparently offended at the death prediction, publishing a public admonition of Franklin as a "fool" and a "liar". In a published response, Franklin mocked Titan Leeds' outrage and humorously suggested that, in fact, Titan Leeds had died in accordance with the earlier prediction and was thus writing his almanacs as a [[ghost]], resurrected from the grave to haunt and torment Franklin. Franklin continued to jokingly refer to Titan Leeds as a "ghost" even after Titan Leeds' actual death during 1738. Daniel Leeds' blasphemous and occultist reputation and his pro-monarchy stance in the largely anti-monarchist colonial south of New Jersey, combined with Benjamin Franklin's later ongoing depiction of Titan Leeds as a ghost, may have originated or contributed to the local folk legend of a so-called "Leeds Devil" lurking in the Pine Barrens.&lt;ref name=regal/&gt;

During 1728, Titan Leeds began to include the Leeds [[family crest]] on the masthead of his almanacs. The Leeds family crest depicted a [[wyvern]], a bat-winged [[dragon]]-like legendary creature that stands upright on two clawed feet. Regal notes that the wyvern on the Leeds family crest is reminiscent of the popular descriptions of the Jersey Devil. The inclusion of this family crest on Leeds' almanacs may have further contributed to the Leeds family's poor reputation among locals and possibly influenced the popular descriptions of the Leeds Devil or Jersey Devil. The fearsome appearance of the crest's wyvern and the increasing animosity among local South Jersey residents towards [[Kingship|royalty]], [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]], and [[nobility]] (with whom family crests were associated) may have helped facilitate the legend of the Leeds Devil and the association of the Leeds family with "devils" and "monsters".&lt;ref name=regal/&gt;

===The Leeds Devil===
Regal notes that, by the late 1700s and early 1800s, the "Leeds Devil" had become a legendary [[monster]] or [[ghost story]] in the southern New Jersey area. Into the early to mid 19th century, stories continued to circulate in southern New Jersey of the Leeds Devil, a "monster wandering the Pine Barrens". An oral tradition of "Leeds Devil" monster/ghost stories subsequently became established in the  Pine Barrens area.&lt;ref name=courier&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trethan|first1=Phaedra|title=Haddonfield talk explores Jersey Devil's 'real' roots|url=http://www.courierpostonline.com/story/news/2016/11/11/haddonfield-talk-explores-jersey-devils-real-roots/93652550/|accessdate=7 January 2017|agency=Courier-Post|date=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the "Leeds Devil" legend has apparently existed since the 18th century, Regal states that the more modern depiction of the Jersey Devil, as well as the now pervasive "Jersey Devil" name, first became truly standardized in current form during the early 20th century:

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the pre-Revolutionary period, the Leeds family, who called the Pine Barrens home, soured its relationship with the Quaker majority ... The Quakers saw no hurry to give their former fellow religionist an easy time in circles of gossip. His wives had all died, as had several children. His son Titan stood accused by Benjamin Franklin of being a ghost ... The family crest had winged dragons on it. In a time when [[American Revolution|thoughts of independence]] were being born, these issues made the Leeds family political and religious monsters. From all this over time the legend of the Leeds Devil was born. References to the 'Jersey Devil' do not appear in newspapers or other printed material until the twentieth century. The first major flap came in 1909. It is from these sightings that the popular image of the creature—batlike wings, horse head, claws, and general air of a dragon—became standardized.&lt;ref name=regal/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

References to a "Leeds Devil" or "Devil of Leeds" appear in earlier printed material prior to the widespread usage of the "Jersey Devil" name. During 1859, the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' published an article detailing the Leeds Devil folk tales popular among Pine Barren residents (or "[[Piney (Pine Barrens resident)|pine rats]]".)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015030143294?urlappend=;seq=564|title=Atlantic monthly  v.3 1859 Jan-Jun.|website=HathiTrust|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yuhas|first1=Alan|title=Jersey Devil 'sighting' reignites excitement but experts pour cold water|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/17/jersey-devil-new-jersey-myth-photo-origin-story|accessdate=7 January 2017|agency=The Guardian|date=October 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A newspaper from 1887 describes sightings of a winged creature, referred to as "the Devil of Leeds", allegedly spotted near the Pine Barrens and well known among the local populace of [[Burlington County, New Jersey]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whenever he went near it, it would give a most unearthly yell that frightened the dogs. It whipped at every dog on the place. "That thing," said the colonel, "is not a bird nor an animal, but it is the Leeds devil, according to the description, and it was born over in [[Evesham Township, New Jersey|Evasham]], [[Burlington County, NJ|Burlington county]], a hundred years ago. There is no mistake about it. I never saw the horrible critter myself, but I can remember well when it was roaming around in Evasham woods fifty years ago, and when it was hunted by men and dogs and shot at by the best marksmen there were in all South Jersey, but could not be killed. There isn't a family in Burlington or any of the adjoining counties that does not know of the Leeds devil, and it was the [[bogeyman|bugaboo]] to frighten children with when I was a boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Devil of Leeds|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/profile/tee-veeed/clipnumber/53579/|accessdate=22 June 2016|date=October 15, 1887|archiveurl=https://newspaperarchive.com/profile/tee-veeed/clipnumber/53579/|archivedate=22 June 2016|location=Elkhart Sentinel &gt;1887 Elkhart Sentinel|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reported encounters==
There have been many claims of sightings and occurrences involving the Jersey Devil.

According to legend, while visiting the Hanover Mill Works to inspect his [[Round shot|cannonballs]] being forged, Commodore [[Stephen Decatur]] sighted a flying creature and fired a cannonball directly upon it, to no effect.&lt;ref name=mccloy/&gt;

[[Joseph Bonaparte]], elder brother of [[Napoleon]], is also claimed to have seen the Jersey Devil while hunting on his [[Bordentown, New Jersey|Bordentown]] estate about 1820.&lt;ref name="americanfolklore"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.americanfolklore.net/folktales/nj6.html |title= Joseph Bonaparte and the Jersey Devil |author= S.

Similar attacks were reported during 1841, accompanied by tracks and screams.&lt;ref name=mccloy/&gt;

In [[Greenwich Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey|Greenwich]] during December 1925 a local farmer shot an unidentified animal as it attempted to steal his [[chickens]], and then photographed the corpse.

===Sightings of 1909===
During the week of January 16 through 23, 1909, newspapers of the time published hundreds of claimed encounters with the Jersey Devil from all over the state. Among alleged encounters publicized that week were claims the creature "attacked" a [[trolley car]] in [[Haddon Heights, New Jersey|Haddon Heights]] and a social club in [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]].&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Mark and Sceurman, Mark (2004).

[[Vigilante]] groups and groups of [[hunters]] roamed the pines and countrysides in search of the Devil.&lt;ref name=bart/&gt; During this period, it is rumored that the [[Philadelphia Zoo]] posted a $10,000 reward for the creature.

==Explanations==
Skeptics believe the Jersey Devil to be nothing more than a creative manifestation of the early English settlers, [[bogeyman]] stories created and told by bored Pine Barren residents as a form of children's entertainment; the byproduct of the historical local disdain for the Leeds family; the misidentification of known animals; and rumors from negative perceptions of the local rural population of the Pine Barren (known as "[[Piney (Pine Barrens resident)|pineys]]").&lt;ref name="CSI/SI"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Regal|first1=Brian|title=The Jersey Devil: The Real Story|url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_jersey_devil_the_real_story|website=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|publisher=''Skeptical Inquirer'' Volume 37.6 (November/December 2013)|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frightening reputation of the Pine Barrens may indeed have contributed to the Jersey Devil legend; historically, the Pine Barrens were considered inhospitable land, and [[gang]]s of [[highwaymen]], such as the politically disdained [[British Loyalist|Loyalist]] [[brigands]] known as the [[Pine Robbers]], were known to rob and attack travelers passing through the Barrens. During the 1700s and 1800s, residents of the isolated Pine Barrens were deemed the dregs or [[Outcast (person)|outcast]]s of society: [[Yokel|poor farmers]], [[fugitive]]s, [[brigand]]s, [[Lenape|Native American]]s, [[poaching|poachers]], [[moonshine]]rs, [[fugitive slave|runaway slaves]], and [[desertion|deserting soldiers]]. So-called pineys have sometimes fostered certain frightening stories about themselves and the Pine Barrens to discourage outsiders or intruders from entering the Barrens. Pineys were further demonized and vilified after two [[eugenics]] studies during the early 20th century, which depicted pineys as [[congenital]] [[idiot]]s and criminals, as seen in the research performed on "[[The Kallikak Family]]" by [[Henry H. Goddard]], which is now considered biased or inaccurate and, most likely, falsified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forteanzoology.com/faq/detail.asp?iFaq=701&amp;iType=85 The Monster in Jersey's Pines], accessed October 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeff Brunner of the Humane Society of New Jersey thinks the [[sandhill crane]] is the basis of the Jersey Devil stories, adding, "There are no photographs, no bones, no hard evidence whatsoever, and worst of all, no explanation of its origins that doesn't require belief in the supernatural."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.citypaper.net/articles/102397/cover.jerseydevil.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009043855/http://archives.citypaper.net/articles/102397/cover.jerseydevil.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-09 |title=The Devil Went Down To Jersey |publisher=Archives.citypaper.net |accessdate=2014-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outdoorsman and author [[Tom Brown, Jr.]] spent several seasons living in the wilderness of the Pine Barrens.

Medical sociologist Robert E.

One New Jersey group called the "Devil Hunters" refer to themselves as "official researchers of the Jersey Devil", and devote time to collecting reports, visiting historic sites, and going on nocturnal hunts in the Pine Barrens in order to "find proof that the Jersey Devil does in fact exist."&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barry|first=Dan|title=THIS LAND; In the Wilds of New Jersey, a Legend Inspires a Hunt|work=The New York Times|page=14|date=8 September 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/us/08land.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due in part to its isolated and undeveloped nature, the Pine Barrens have encouraged various folk legends.&lt;ref name="feewebb"/&gt; Apart from the Jersey Devil, many other [[Legends and tales of the New Jersey Pine Barrens|legends are associated with the Pine Barrens]]: supernatural creatures and ghosts said to haunt the pine forests include the ghost of the [[pirate]] [[Captain Kidd]], who supposedly buried treasure in the Pine Barrens and is sometimes allegedly seen in the company of the Jersey Devil; the ghost of the Black Doctor, the benevolent spirit of an [[African-American]] doctor who, after being forbidden from practicing medicine due to his race, entered the Pine Barrens to practice medicine in the isolated communities of the Barrens and is said to still come to the aid of lost or injured travelers; the ghost of the Black Dog, which, unlike many [[Black dog (ghost)|black dog legends]], is usually portrayed as harmless; the ghost of the Golden-Haired Girl, the spirit of a girl who is said to be staring out into the sea, dressed in white, mourning the loss of her lover at sea; and the White [[Stag]], a ghostly white deer said to rescue travelers in the Barrens from danger.&lt;ref name="feewebb"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fee|first1=Christopher R.|last2=Webb|first2=Jeffery B.|title=American Myths, Legends, and Tall Tales: An Encyclopedia of American Folklore|date=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXnEDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA782&amp;dq=pine+barrens+legends&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1xpiPi7bRAhUDIMAKHaOYAuIQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=pine%20barrens%20legends&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, William.

Writing in [[Jan Harold Brunvand]]'s ''American Folklore: An Encyclopedia'', [[Rutgers]] Professor Angus Kress Gillespie called the Jersey Devil "an obscure regional legend" for most of its existence, and said that "after more than 250 years in oral circulation, the legend of the 'Jersey Devil' has many variations ...". Gillespie cites the Devil's image used on T-shirts, buttons, and postcards, and cocktails named after the Devil, as indications that "the recent history of the Jersey Devil is more in the realm of popular culture than folklore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brunvand|first=Jan Harold|title=American folklore|date=1998|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8153-3350-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=l0N_sedAATAC&amp;pg=PA408&amp;dq=1909+jersey+devil+Brunvand#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoaxes===
[[Gordon Stein]] in ''Encyclopedia of Hoaxes'' (1993) noted that the alleged footprints of the Jersey Devil during 1909 resembled a [[Horse hoof|horse's hoof]]. According to Stein a man later admitted he had faked some of these footprints.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Stein|Stein, Gordon]]. (1993). ''Encyclopedia of Hoaxes''. Gale Group. pp. 253-254. {{ISBN|0-8103-8414-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoff Tibballs in ''The World's Greatest Hoaxes'' (2006) has claimed that Norman Jeffries was involved in hoaxing the Jersey Devil:

{{quote|Norman Jeffries, publicist for [[Philadelphia]]'s Arch Street Museum and renowned hoaxer, was well aware of the stories about the Jersey Devil. So when the museum proprietor, T. F. Hopkins, admitted that it was in danger of closure unless Jeffries came up with something to boost attendances, the publicist decided that a captive Jersey Devil would be the ideal crowd-puller.&lt;ref name="Tibballs 2006"&gt;Tibballs, Geoff. (2006). ''The World's Greatest Hoaxes''. Barnes &amp; Noble. p. 198. {{ISBN|978-0760782224}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He also planted nonfictional newspaper stories about new sightings of the Devil.&lt;ref name="Tibballs 2006"/&gt; During 1909, Jeffries with his friend Jacob Hope, an animal trainer, purchased a [[kangaroo]] from a [[circus]] and attached artificial claws and bat wings onto it with glue. They declared to the public they had captured the Devil and it was displayed at the [[museum]]. Twenty years later, Jeffries admitted to the hoax.&lt;ref&gt;White, Edward; White, Thomas. (2011).

The '''Lawson Boom''' is a term used to describe the macroeconomic conditions prevailing in the United Kingdom at the end of the 1980s, which became associated with the policies of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Nigel Lawson]].

The term was used by analogy with the phrase "The [[Barber Boom]]", an earlier period of rapid expansion under the tenure as chancellor of [[Anthony Barber]] in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Edward Heath]]. Critics of Lawson assert that a combination of the abandonment of [[monetarism]], the adoption of a de facto exchange-rate target of 3 [[Deutsche Mark|deutschmarks]] to the pound, and excessive fiscal laxity (in particular the 1988 budget) unleashed an inflationary spiral.

The economic boom saw strong economic growth during the second half of the 1980s, sparking a sharp fall in unemployment, which was still in excess of 3 million at the end of 1986, but had fallen to 1.6 million (the lowest for some 10 years) by the end of 1989.

In 1990, [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] referred to the period as the "Lawson boom" in a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] debate, quoting a report which said:
:"There have been three phases of this sort, all of which had serious consequences.
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[Reginald Maudling|Maudling]]'s dash for growth 1963&amp;ndash;64;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[Barber Boom|Barber's boom]], 1972&amp;ndash;73;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;The Lawson boom, 1986&amp;ndash;88."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons|title=Debates for 14 Nov 1990|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199091/cmhansrd/1990-11-14/Debate-2.html|date=14 November 1990|column=589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The "dash for growth" had failed to save the Conservative government from electoral defeat at the hands of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 general election]], and was followed by a difficult period for the economy (during which unemployment nearly doubled) in the second half of the 1960s. The "Barber Boom" a decade later had contributed to a recession and was a factor in the Conservatives losing to Labour again after the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]].

The inflationary pressures of the Lawson Boom were one of the reasons given for the UK's entry into the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] in October 1990, a move that was supposed to help restrain inflation (which had been approaching 10%) in the UK by "importing" the anti-inflationary credibility of the [[Bundesbank]]. However, the economy fell into its [[Early 1990s recession|third recession in less than 20 years]], with unemployment coming close to 3 million by the end of 1992, even though this time the Conservatives managed to gain [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|re-election]].

==The law==

Pursuant to New York Vehicle Traffic Law Section 1192 2-a(b), any person operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and transporting a child is guilty of a Class E Felony.&lt;ref&gt;http://ypdcrime.com/vt/section1192.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the event that reckless driving and death or serious physical injury is not a factor, an individual is guilty of a class D felony. Defendants convicted under the new law face a prison sentence of up to four years and a fine of $1000&amp;ndash;$5000. The installation of a mandatory ignition interlock device for a term of at least six months is also an expected provision of sentencing (mandatory for all DWI offenses August 15, 2010).&lt;ref name="NYTimes1"/&gt; Moreover, licenses are automatically suspended pending prosecution and once proven guilty, the person will be reported to the Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment and his/her license will be suspended for a minimum of twelve months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Robinson| first = Cheryl| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = New York toughens drunken driving law| work = | publisher = Cable News Network| date = 19 November 2009| url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/11/19/new.york.dwi.law/| format = | doi = | accessdate = 1 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First time and repeat offenders are charged with an E level felony, regardless of criminal record.

The following is an '''incomplete list of chamber music festivals,''' which encapsulates [[music festivals]] focused on [[chamber music]]. This list may have some or complete overlap with '''[[list of early music festivals]]''' and '''[[list of contemporary classical music festivals]].''' Chamber music is a form of [[classical music]] that is composed for a small group of instruments—traditionally a group that could fit in a [[Great chamber|palace chamber]] or any small chamber. Most broadly, it includes any [[art music]] that is performed by a small number of performers, with one performer to a part. From its earliest beginnings in the Medieval period to the present, chamber music has been a reflection of the changes in the technology and the society that produced it.&lt;ref&gt;Estelle Ruth Jorgensen, ''The Art of Teaching Music'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2008): 153–54. {{ISBN|978-0-253-35078-7}} (cloth); {{ISBN|978-0-253-21963-3}} (pbk).&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of solar eclipses visible from the United Kingdom''' (i.e. the islands of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]) between '''AD&amp;nbsp;1000{{spaced ndash}}AD&amp;nbsp;2091'''.

A [[solar eclipse]] occurs when the [[Moon]] passes between [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]], thereby totally or partially obscuring Earth's view of the Sun.

This is the [[Lent]]en eclipse also reported in the [[Peterborough Chronicle]] as being on the thirteenth day before the [[kalends]] of April: '''After this, during Lent, the sun and the day darkened about the noon-tide of the day, when men were eating; and they lighted candles to eat by. That was the thirteenth day before the kalends of April.

The '''MV ''Francop'''''  is a German-owned, [[Antigua and Barbuda]]-flagged [[Merchant vessel|merchant]] [[cargo ship]]. In November 2009 the [[Israeli navy]] boarded the vessel in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], suspecting that it was carrying weapons destined for [[Hezbollah]] from the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] in violation of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701]]. Hundreds of tons of weapons were found on the ship, which was then directed to berth in Israel.

== Boarding incident ==
{{Main|Francop Affair}}
On 4 November 2009, in an operation named [[Operation Four Species]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1126397.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israeli navy]] [[commando]]s of [[Shayetet 13]] boarded the ship in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] without resistance, acting on intelligence reports which it had received.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; The ship was about {{convert|160|km|nmi}} off the coast of [[Israel]], near [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; A spokesperson for the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) said the ship was carrying "dozens of shipping containers, carrying numerous weapons, disguised as civilian cargo among hundreds of other containers on board". The IDF also claimed that the weapons originated from [[Iran]] and were to be directed to [[Hezbollah]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The navy said that the crew was not aware of the purported smuggling and cooperated with Israeli commandos.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; After the boarding, the Israeli Navy directed the ship to the Israeli [[port of Ashdod]], where a thorough inspection was held.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;

According to the IDF, the ship picked up the cargo in [[Damietta]], [[Egypt]]; the cargo arrived in Egypt on a ship that sailed from [[Bandar-Abbas]], [[Iran]] on 25 October.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;{{cite news |first=Anshel |last=Pfeffer |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1126069.html |title=Israel seizes ship in Mediterranean carrying more than 3,000 rockets |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was then set to sail to [[Limassol]], Cyprus and then [[Latakia]], Syria.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; The IDF suspects that the cargo was intended for Hezbollah, which fought Israel in the [[2006 Lebanon War]]. Following the war, [[United Nations Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|Resolution 1701]] forbade the shipments of arms to Hezbollah.

An Israeli naval official claimed that the amount of weapons found is ten times more than that found during [[Operation Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref name="Ynet"&gt;{{cite news |first=Hanan |last=Greenberg |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3800306,00.html |title=Navy: 10 times more arms on ship than on Karin-A |publisher=[[Ynet]] |date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arms shipment weighed 320 tons and were held in containers marked with Iranian shipping codes.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news |first=Teibel |last=Amy |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h3S0DqyLu9CfgcBASy2XHOGCk0IAD9BPAIG80 |title=Hezbollah denies link to arms ship |publisher=[[Google News]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jpost&gt;{{cite news | url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1257455195197&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull | title=The haul: 320 tons of Katyushas, other rockets, shells and bullets | last=Katz | first=Yaakov | date=5 November 2009 | work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] | publisher=jpost.com | accessdate=6 November 2009 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The seized weaponry included 9,000 [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar shells]], thousands of 107-mm [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha rockets]], 600 122-mm rockets, and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition.&lt;ref name=jpost/&gt; The arms shipment was the largest ever seized by Israeli authorities.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

On 5 November 2009, ambassadors and diplomats from 44 countries and military attaches from 27 armies in the world were invited by the IDF and the Foreign Ministry in order for them to be witnesses of the many weapons and accumulation of ammunition that were found on the ''Francop'' ship.&lt;ref name="IDF"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/today/09/11/0505.htm |title=Ambassadors, Military Attaches Witness Weapons Seized from Francop |publisher=[[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=5 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506234851/http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/today/09/11/0505.htm |archivedate=6 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been replaced by a new event called [[Immerse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.experienceimmerse.com Immerse Web link], Retrieved June 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The event started in 1975 as Seminar in the Rockies, launched by Christian Artists' Corp's president Cam Floria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian Artists Seminar Turns 25|url=http://www.todayschristianmusic.com/features/christian-artists-seminar-turns-25/|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists Lineup Announced For GMA Music In The Rockies|url=http://breathecast.christianpost.com/Christian.Music.Artist-Artists.Lineup.Announced.For.GMA.Music.In.The.Rockies/Article-212_656.htm|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gospelmusic.org/newsmedia/pressRoom_detail.aspx?iid=14246&amp;tid=33 It was Previously known as "Seminar in the Rockies"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313112847/http://www.gospelmusic.org/newsmedia/pressRoom_detail.aspx?iid=14246&amp;tid=33 |date=2012-03-13 }}, Retrieved June 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the [[Gospel Music Association]] (GMA) began to take over the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists Lineup Announced For GMA Music In The Rockies|url=http://breathecast.christianpost.com/Christian.Music.Artist-Artists.Lineup.Announced.For.GMA.Music.In.The.Rockies/Article-212_656.htm|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event/festival was previously held at [[YMCA]] of the Rockies in [[Estes Park, Colorado|Estes Park]], [[Colorado]].

Both "Music in the Rockies" and "Seminar in the Rockies" had a series of concerts in the evenings, with some notable performers and attendees. The 34th annual event was held from August 3 to August 9, 2008.

In 2009, the event was replaced by a new event called [[Immerse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gospelmusic.org/newsmedia/pressRoom_detail.aspx?iid=41726&amp;tid=33 Press release stating "...

The [[Soviet Union]] used the incident as a pretext to justify the eventual [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|occupation]] of Estonia.

==Background==
''Orzeł'' was docked at [[Oksywie]] when [[Nazi Germany]] [[Invasion of Poland|attacked Poland]], setting off World War II. The submarine initially participated in [[Worek Plan|Operation Worek]], but withdrew from the Polish coast on 4 September as the situation evolved. Damaged by German minesweepers and leaking oil, the decision was made to head for Tallinn, which was reached on 14 September 1939 at about 01:30.&lt;ref name= RKII&gt;{{cite news |last=Kuzak |first=Rafal |date=31 October 2013 |title=Największy zdrajca z kampanii wrześniowej?

The [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention of 1907]] enjoined signatories, including Germany, from interfering with the right of enemy warships to use neutral ports, within certain limits. Initially, the Estonians were quite accommodating of ''Orzel'', assisting with the repair of a damaged compressor.&lt;ref name= RKII /&gt; However, probably because of German pressure, Estonian military authorities soon boarded the ship, declared the crew interned, confiscated all the navigation aids and maps, and commenced dismantling all the armaments. An Estonian officer removed the naval ensign at the submarine's stern.&lt;ref name= RK /&gt;

==The incident==

===Escape===
[[File:ORP Orzel.jpg|300px|right|thumb|ORP ''Orzeł'']]
The crew of ORP ''Orzeł'' conspired to escape under the new command of its [[chief officer]], [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lt.]] [[Jan Grudzinski|Jan Grudziński]], and its new first officer, Lieutenant Andzej Piasecki.&lt;ref name= HGH&gt;Haar, Geirr H.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=v8A7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=operation+worek&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mqlUZZGdlu&amp;sig=1dEMPn5xPUJglSWoywgGfRZ9wMs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWmvWTj4DLAhXFYiYKHUu0AdYQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=operation%20worek&amp;f=false The Gathering Storm] p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; This started with Grudziński's sabotage of the torpedo hoist on 16 September, preventing the Estonians from removing the six aft torpedoes. Since it was a Sunday, another one couldn't be immediately acquired. Meanwhile, [[Boatswain]] Wladyslaw Narkiewicz took a small boat around the harbour. Under the guise of fishing, he covertly measured the depth of the planned escape route.&lt;ref name= RK&gt;{{cite news |last=Kuzak |first=Rafal |date=23 November 2013 |title=Orzeł wyzwolony. Brawurowa ucieczka z Tallina |url=http://ciekawostkihistoryczne.pl/2013/11/23/orzel-wyzwolony-brawurowa-ucieczka-z-tallina/ |newspaper=ciekawostki historyczne |location= |access-date=20 February 2016 |language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another sailor sabotaged the submarine's mooring lines.&lt;ref name= little&gt;{{cite book| last = Kelly| first = C. Brian| title = Best Little Stories from World War II: More Than 100 True Stories| publisher = Sourcebooks, Inc.| date = 1 November 2010| location =| pages = 21–24| isbn = 9781402243585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At around 00:00 on 18 September, the port lights suffered an unexplained malfunction. Seizing the opportunity, Lieutenant Grudziński prepared the submarine for departure. The crew was forced to delay by the arrival of an Estonian officer. After a 30-minute inspection, he deemed nothing to be out of the ordinary and bid the Poles goodnight. The crew resumed with their plans. Two Estonian guards at the dock were lured aboard and nonviolently taken prisoner, the lighting in the port was intentionally sabotaged, and the mooring lines were cut with an ax. Both engines were started, and the submarine made her escape in the darkness.&lt;ref name= RK /&gt;

Estonian spotlights began sweeping the harbour, from the buildings to the quay, before finally locking onto ''Orzeł''. The Estonians opened up with machine guns and light artillery, damaging the conning tower. Heavier guns supposedly didn't open fire for fear of damaging other ships. At the mouth of the harbor the submarine briefly ran aground on a sandbar, but quickly managed to get free and escape into the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]].&lt;ref name= HGH /&gt;

===At sea===
Lieutenant Grudziński intended to seize the maps of a German vessel, as all of ''Orzeł''{{'}}s navigational aids, with the exception of a guide of Swedish lighthouses, had been confiscated. No German merchantmen were ever spotted, though. After three weeks of searching, it was decided to leave the Baltic and head for Britain. It took two days to pass through the heavily guarded entrance. The only references the Poles had were the lighthouse guide and a rudimentary map drawn by the navigation officer.&lt;ref name=HGH /&gt;

The Estonian and German press covering the incident claimed that the two captured guards had been murdered by the Polish sailors. In reality they were deposited off of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] coast in a rubber dingy provided with clothing and food for their safe return home. The two guards were also provided with 50 [[US dollars]] each, as the Polish crew believed that those returning from the [[underworld]] "deserve to travel first class only."{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

''Orzeł'' made landfall off of [[Scotland]] on 14 October. The crew sent out a signal in broken English, and a British [[destroyer]] came out and escorted them into port. ''Orzeł''{{'}}s arrival came a surprise to the [[Admiralty]], which had long presumed the submarine lost.&lt;ref name= HGH /&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Orzel 1939 tablica tallin.jpg|100px|left|thumb|{{ORP|Orzeł|1938|6}} monument in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]]]
{{ORP|Orzeł|1938|6}} was subject to a refit and subsequently brought into service alongside the [[Royal Navy]] in the 2nd Submarine Flotilla in mid-January 1940 to patrol the [[North Sea]].&lt;ref name= HGH /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haar|first=Geirr H|title=No Room for Mistakes: British and Allied Submarine Warfare 1939–1940|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Hjk5CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA302|year=2015|publisher=Casemate Publishers|isbn=9781473875319|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ramifications===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
Following the event, the [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]] reported that the Estonian government had deliberately allowed ''Orzeł'' to escape and that other Polish submarines were hiding in ports throughout the Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Crowe| first = David| title = The Baltic states and the great powers: foreign relations, 1938–1940| publisher = Westview Press| edition = illustrated| date = 19 January 1993| pages = 88| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LeFoAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=&amp;focus=| isbn = 9780813304816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union, which [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 17 September 1939, accused Estonia of conspiring with the Polish seamen and "aiding them to escape", challenging the neutrality of Estonia. The Soviets demanded to be allowed to establish military bases on Estonian soil, threatening war if Estonia did not comply. This was served as a political cover for their actions, as the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] had already given German approval to the Soviet Union taking over the Baltic countries. The ''Orzeł'' incident was used to force a "pact of defence and mutual assistance" on Estonia, which was signed on 28 September 1939, and allowed for the occupation and annexation of Estonia by the Soviet Union in 1940.

''Orzeł'' sank no enemy vessels during her journey from Estonia to Britain, although Soviet authorities blamed her for the loss of the Soviet [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] ''Metallist'' in [[Narva Bay]] on 26 September, the incident being used as a pretext for the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)]].

'''Parker's Opera House''', also known as '''Opera House Store''', '''Woolworth's''' and '''Parker Place''', is a historic building located in [[Mason City, Iowa]], United States.  It was designed by the prominent [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] architect [[William Foster (Iowa architect)|William Foster]].  Cousins H.G. and A.T. Parker built this structure as an opera house, which was the first one in the community.&lt;ref name=Page&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=97000392}}|title=Parker's Opera House|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2016-12-09|author=William C. Page}} with {{NRHP url|id=97000392|photos=y|title=photos}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While it initially filled a need in Mason City, it was replaced by more modern theatres around the turn of the 20th century.  The third floor was created in the building in 1909 when it was placed across the middle of the auditorium. The first floor initially housed a clothing store, and [[F. W. Woolworth Company]] occupied it beginning in the mid-1920s, and the upper floors housed the local offices of the [[Standard Oil Company]] at the same time.&lt;ref name=Page/&gt;  The two-story addition in the rear was built in the 1960s.  The first floor was redesigned in 1997 for Central Park Dentistry.  The upper floors were converted into apartments in 2013.&lt;ref name=iagenweb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iagenweb.org/cerrogordo/history/MasonCity/cg_HIS_parkeroperahs.htm|title=Parker Opera House|publisher=Iowa GenWeb|accessdate=2016-12-09|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone was used for both structural and decorative purposes.  A metal [[cornice]] caps the main [[facade]].  The building was individually listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1998,&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; and as a [[contributing property]] in the [[Mason City Downtown Historic District]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=McDowell&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=98001325}}|title=Mason City Downtown Historic District|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2016-12-09|author1=Alexa McDowell|author2=Joanne R.

'''Pets.com''' was a [[dot-com company|dot-com enterprise]] headquartered in [[San Francisco]] that sold pet supplies to retail customers. It began operations in November 1998 and liquidated in November 2000. A high-profile marketing campaign gave it a widely recognized public presence, including an appearance in the 1999 [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] and an advertisement in the [[Super Bowl XXXIV|2000]] [[Super Bowl]]. Its popular [[sock puppet]] advertising mascot was interviewed by ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine and appeared on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.

Although sales rose dramatically due to the attention, the company was weak on fundamentals and lost money on most of its sales. Its high public profile during its brief existence made it one of the more noteworthy failures of the [[dot-com bubble]] in the 2000s.

==History==
On November 21, 1994, the Pets.com domain name was registered by [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]-based Entrepreneur [[Greg McLemore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whois.domaintools.com/pets.com|title=Pets.com WHOIS, DNS, &amp; Domain Info - DomainTools|website=whois.domaintools.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pets.com Inc.: The Rise and Decline of a Pet Supply Retailer|last=Merlo|first=Omar|publisher=Ivey Publishing|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pets.com website launched in early November 1998 as a spinoff of WebMagic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.webmagic.com/yahoo-news/|title=Yahoo!

A regional advertising campaign using a variety of media began, which included [[television]], [[radio]], [[Print ad|print]], [[outdoor advertising]] and a Pets.com magazine, which had its first issue published in November 1999.

=== Charity work ===
During the company's existence, Pets.com partnered with [[Best Friends Animal Sanctuary]] to start a [[Charity (practice)|charity]] called "Pets.commitment", which provided funding and support for [[Animal shelter|animal shelters]], [[Animal-assisted therapy|animal therapy]], [[service dog]] programs, [[pet care]] and [[Wellness Coaching|wellness organizations]].

==Sock puppet==
[[File:Pets.com sockpuppet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Pets.com sock puppet]]

Pets.com hired the [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] office of [[TBWA\Chiat\Day]] to design its advertising campaign. The firm had recently created the popular [[Taco Bell chihuahua]]. For Pets.com, they designed a doglike sock puppet that carried a microphone in its paw.&lt;ref name="cheyfitz"/&gt; The puppet, performed by [[Michael Ian Black]] (an alumnus of [[MTV]]'s surrealist comedy sketch show ''[[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]]''), was a simple [[sock puppet]] with button eyes, flailing arms, a watch for a collar, and a stick microphone emblazoned with "pets.com".&lt;ref name="cheyfitz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=OL20000127.2.39&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-Pets.com-------1|title=Oak Leaf 27 January 2000 — California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sock puppet first appeared in Pets.com's advertising in August 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2000/11/07/technology/pets/|title=Pets.com goes out of business - Nov. 7, 2000|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the puppet's fame grew through 1999 and 2000, it gained almost [[cult following|cult status]] and widespread popularity. The puppet made an appearance on ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]'' and ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'', [[WABC-TV]]-produced ''[[Live with Kelly|Live with Regis and Kathie Lee]]'', was interviewed in ''People'' Magazine, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' Magazine, [[Entertainment Weekly]] and [[Adweek]] and even had a 36 foot tall "falloon" made in its image for the 1999 [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/08/business/technology-petscom-sock-puppet-s-home-will-close.html|title=TECHNOLOGY; Pets.com, Sock Puppet's Home, Will Close|last=Abelson|first=Reed|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/27/business/media-the-sock-puppet-that-roared-internet-synergy-or-a-conflict-of-interest.html|title=Media; The Sock Puppet That Roared: Internet Synergy or a Conflict of Interest?|last=Kaufman|first=Leslie|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/24/nyregion/and-now-a-balloon-from-our-sponsor.html|title=And Now, a Balloon From Our Sponsor|last=Eaton|first=Leslie|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wisdom of Failure: How to Learn the Tough Leadership Lessons Without|last=G.

After Pets.com liquidated, Hakan and Associates and [[BarNone|Bar None, Inc.]] purchased the rights to the puppet under a joint venture called Sock Puppet LLC for $125,000 in 2002.&lt;ref name="cheyfitz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="barnone"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Sock Puppet On Board With Bar None! |publisher=[[BarNone]] |date=2002-05-09 |url=http://www.barnone.com/sockpuppetrelease.htm |accessdate=2009-02-24 |quote=Bar None and Hakan Enterprises, Inc., joined forces to secure the rights for the Sock Puppet – and they are excited to be able to give him a “second chance” in the advertising world. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020602084525/http://www.barnone.com/sockpuppetrelease.htm |archivedate=June 2, 2002 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/24/business/fi-sock24|title=Sock Puppet Finds a New Home|last=WATERCUTTER|first=ANGELA|date=2002-06-24|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bar None, Inc., an American automotive loan firm, gave the puppet a new slogan: "Everyone deserves a second chance." and aired nine commercials featuring the puppet in July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2002/06/19/2nd-act-for-pets-com-sock-puppet/|title=2ND ACT FOR PETS.COM SOCK PUPPET|date=2002-06-19|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2002-06-24-0206240006-story.html|title=Sock puppet gets 2nd chance|last=News|first=Joelle Tessler, San Jose Mercury|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lawsuit ===
As Pets.com's recognition began to grow, it attracted the attention of the creators of [[Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog]] and [[Ed the Sock]]. Representatives from [[Robert Smigel]] sent letters, including a [[cease and desist]] demand, to Pets.com claiming that the puppet was based on Triumph. Pets.com responded by suing Smigel in the [[U.S. District court|U.S. District Court]] in San Francisco in April 2000, demanding $20 million in damages for [[defamation]] and trade libel. But in revenge, on an episode of Saturday Night Live, Triumph humped the Pets.com dog in a bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/dirty-sock-streisands-stocks Information on Smigel's lawsuit at] [[The Smoking Gun]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks20000427-01.2.15&amp;txq=Pets.com#|title=Daily Kent Stater 27 April 2000 — Kent State University|website=dks.library.kent.edu|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/04/news/mn-26524/2|title=This Legal Dogfight Is No Joke|last=BROWNFIELD|first=PAUL|date=2000-05-04|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2000/04/26/pets-com-poop-on-conans-puppet/|title=PETS.COM POOP$ ON CONAN’S ‘PUP’PET|date=2000-04-26|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was dismissed in February 2001 by [[Judge]] [[Charles R.

== Legacy ==
The publicity surrounding the Pets.com puppet, combined with the company's collapse, made it such a symbol of dot-com folly that [[E-Trade]] referred to it in an advertisement during the [[2001 Super Bowl]]. The commercial, which parodies the famous [[Keep America Beautiful|crying Indian public service advertisement]] from 1971, shows a [[chimpanzee]] riding on horseback through a ruined dot-com landscape. The chimpanzee comes across a company named "eSocks.com" that is being demolished and weeps when a discarded sock puppet lands at his feet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONZFkqzuMjI E-Trade Chimp on a Horse commercial, aired during the 2001 Super Bowl]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/2hrs2go-etrade-wins-ad-super-bowl/|title=2HRS2GO: E*Trade wins ad Super Bowl|date=2001-02-22|work=CNET|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://adage.com/videos/etrade-ghost-town/855|title=E-Trade - Ghost Town - Ad Age|website=adage.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip James Corso''' (May 22, 1915 – July 16, 1998) was an American Army officer.

He served in the [[United States Army]] from February 23, 1942, to March 1, 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = |first = |authorlink = |coauthors = |title = Philip J. Corso's Department of the Army Form 66, Officer Qualification Record |work = |publisher = |date = |url = http://www.cufon.org/cufon/corso_da66.htm |doi = |accessdate = 2007-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]].

Corso published ''[[The Day After Roswell]]'', about how he was involved in the research of extraterrestrial technology recovered from the 1947 [[Roswell UFO Incident]]. 

On July 23, 1997, he was a guest on the popular late night radio show, ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' with [[Art Bell]] where he spoke live about his Roswell story.  This interview was rebroadcast by ''Coast to Coast AM'' on July 3, 2010.

==Biography==

===Military career===
After joining the Army in 1942, Corso served in [[United States Army Military Intelligence|Army Intelligence]] in Europe, becoming chief of the US [[Counterintelligence Corps (United States Army)|Counter Intelligence Corps]] in Rome. 

In 1945, Corso arranged for the safe passage of 10,000 Jewish [[World War II]] refugees out of [[Rome]] to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]].  He was the personal emissary to Giovanni Battista Montini at the Vatican, later [[Pope Paul VI]], during the period when the "[[Ratlines (World War II aftermath)|Nazi Rat Lines]]" were most active.

During the [[Korean War]] (1950–1953), Corso performed intelligence duties under General [[Douglas MacArthur]] as Chief of the Special Projects branch of the Intelligence Division, Far East Command. One of his primary duties was to keep track of enemy [[prisoner of war]] (POW) camps in [[North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=House Subcommittee on Military Personnel, Statement of Colonel {ret.} Phillip Corso|work=|publisher=|date=1996-09-17|url=http://www.aiipowmia.com/testimony/corso17.html|doi=|accessdate=2009-05-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513101937/http://www.aiipowmia.com//testimony/corso17.html|archivedate=May 13, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corso was in charge of investigating the estimated number of U.S. and other [[United Nations]] POWs held at each camp and their treatment.

At later hearings in 1992 of the [[Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs]], Corso provided first hand testimony, that many hundreds of American POWs were abandoned at these camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =|first =|authorlink =|coauthors =|title =Testimony Of Dolores Alfond Before The Pennsylvania Legislature|work =|publisher =|date =1999-05-03|url =http://www.nationalalliance.org/korea/k-alfond.htm|doi =|accessdate =2007-02-09|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061211015741/http://www.nationalalliance.org/korea/k-alfond.htm|archivedate =2006-12-11|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |last =  |first =  |authorlink =  |coauthors =  |title = Senate Select Committee 49 |work =  |publisher = AII POW-MIA |date = 1992-11-11 |url = http://aiipowmia.com/ssc/ssc49.html  |doi = |accessdate = 2007-02-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061103115429/http://www.aiipowmia.com/ssc/ssc49.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At those hearings, Senator [[John McCain]] (R-AZ) dismissed the undocumented and uncorroborated allegations made by Corso as being extremely difficult to believe. McCain implied that Corso was guilty of fabricating the truth and essentially terminated the testimony being given by Corso immediately after a severe verbal reprimand on live television. McCain stated that his knowledge obtained from those who had personal relationships with Eisenhower led him to believe that Eisenhower was just not capable of allowing known American POWs to remain incarcerated after the termination of the Korean War.

Corso was on the [[staff officer|staff]] of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]'s [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] for four years (1953–1957).

In 1961, he became Chief of [[the Pentagon]]'s Foreign Technology desk in Army Research and Development, working under Lt. Gen. [[Arthur Trudeau]].

In his book ''The Day After Roswell'' (co-author [[William J. Birnes]]) claims he stewarded extraterrestrial artifacts recovered from a crash near [[Roswell, New Mexico]], in 1947.

Corso says a covert government group was assembled under the leadership of Adm. [[Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter]], the first [[director of Central Intelligence]] (see [[Majestic 12]]). Among its tasks was to collect all information on off-planet technology. The US administration simultaneously discounted the existence of flying saucers in the eyes of the public, Corso says.

According to Corso, the [[reverse engineering]] of these artifacts indirectly led to the development of accelerated [[particle beam]] devices, [[fiber optics]], [[laser]]s, [[integrated circuit]] chips and [[Kevlar]] material.

In the book, Corso claims the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI), or "Star Wars", was meant to achieve the destructive capacity of electronic guidance systems in incoming enemy [[warhead]]s, as well as the disabling of enemy spacecraft, including those of extraterrestrial origin.

===Death===
Corso died of a "massive heart attack" on July 16th, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phils.com.au/corso.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.v-j-enterprises.com/crsodies.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Reichskrieg''''' was a [[war]] fought in 1311 and 1312 by the [[Free imperial city|imperial cities]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] against [[Eberhard I, Count of Württemberg]], known as 'Eberhard the Illustrious Highness'.

== Course ==
Eberhard&amp;nbsp;I supported the [[Bohemia]]n estates and the Bohemian king, [[Henry of Carinthia]] in their conflict against Emperor [[Albert I (HRR)|Albert&amp;nbsp;I]] of [[Habsburg]] and his successor, [[Henry VII (HRR)|Henry VII]]. In 1309, charges were brought against Eberhard because of the grasping, self-serving way he discharged his duties as ''[[Vogt#Landvögte|Landvogt]]'', and he was therefore summoned by Henry&amp;nbsp;VII to a ''[[Hoftag]]'' at [[Speyer]]. Eberhard left Speyer prematurely, whereupon Henry imposed the [[Imperial Ban]] on him. Henry now supported the [[Swabia]]n imperial cities in their confrontation with Count Eberhard of Württemberg, who had also operated an aggressive territorial policy against the cities. Because Henry was going to [[Italy]], he appointed the new ''Reichslandvogt'', Conrad IV of [[Weinsberg]],  as the army commander of the Swabian imperial cities and several nobles. The principal Swabian cities involved were [[Esslingen am Neckar]] and [[Reutlingen]]; the nobles included von Tübingen, von Vaihingen and Herter of Dusslingen.

In spring 1311 the ''[[Reichskrieg]]'' began, the first military action presumably being the siege of enemy's family castle, [[Wirtemberg Castle|Wirtemberg]], which took place at the beginning of May. After a failed [[relief (military)|relief]] attempt on 26 May, the castle was captured on 13 July. After the [[Hohenasperg]] Castle fell in August 1312, Eberhard, now a fugitive, was received by his [[Margraviate of Baden|Baden]] brother-in-law, Margrave Rudolf Hesso in one of the two ''[[bergfried]]s'' of [[Besigheim]].

Only the death of Henry VII on 24 August 1313, and the political situation after the king's election in 1314, when [[Louis IV (HRR)|Louis IV]] was crowned king and [[Frederick the Fair]] was declared as [[counter-king]], prevented Württemberg's defeat. Eberhard then cleverly manoeuvered between king and counter-king, so that he was not only able to compensate himself for his territorial losses but also gain additional territories. 

The Reichsheer captured or destroyed ''inter alia'' the following castles: Wirtemberg, [[Hohenasperg]], [[Hohenjungingen Castle|Hohenjungingen]], [[Ror Castle|Ror]], [[Old Lichtenstein Castle|Old Lichtenstein]], [[Haideck Castle|Haideck]], [[Hochbiedeck Castle|Hochbiedeck]], [[Greifenstein Castle (Württemberg)|Greifenstein]], Untergreifenstein,&lt;ref name="Schedel"&gt;Hartmann Schedel: ''Weltchronik''.

Weindefenung its destruction was dated to the early 14th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die „Räuberburg“ Dischingen … der Legende auf der Spur|trans-title=|periodical=feuerbach.de|publisher=|url=http://www.feuerbach.de/news_196_20051022435a88fb9e1af_.html|deadurl=yes|format=|accessdate=2012-01-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209162650/http://feuerbach.de/news_196_20051022435a88fb9e1af_.html|archivedate=2007-12-09|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marbach am Neckar]].

The following were not captured: [[Hohenneuffen]], [[Hohenurach]] and town, [[Hohenwittlingen Castle]] and [[Seeburg Castle (Bad Urach)|Seeburg]].&lt;ref name="Schedel"/&gt;

The '''Rey de Reyes 2000''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "King of Kings") was the fourth annual [[Rey de Reyes]] [[professional wrestling]] tournament and show, produced by the Mexican [[wrestling promotion]] [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]]. The event took place on March 5, 2000, in the Toreo de Cuatro Caminos arena in [[Naucalpan]], [[Mexico State]], [[Mexico]]. The Rey de Reyes tournament consisted of a semi-final round of four four-man elimination matches and a final match with the winners of each of the semi-finals facing off in an elimination match until only one man remained. The final of the 2000 Rey de Reyes tournament pitted [[Abismo Negro]], [[El Alebrije (wrestler)|El Alebrije]], [[Charly Manson]], and [[Cibernético]] against each other. Besides the five tournament matches the show featured an additional four matches including two ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'' matches, one where the hair of the wrestler's seconds were on the line. The other ''Apuesta'' match, which was also the main event match saw both [[La Parka, Jr.]] and Gigante Drako put their masks on the line.

==Production==
===Background===
Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican ''[[Lucha Libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]], [[wrestling promotion|company]] [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] has held a [[Rey de Reyes]] (Spanish for "King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February,&lt;ref name="Rey1997"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#1997 | title = Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Rey de Reyes | accessdate = February 19, 2009 | date=February 21, 1997 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the [[eponym]]ious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's ''Rey''.&lt;ref name=YIR1997&gt;{{cite news|title=1997 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2332|date=January 7, 1998|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004&gt;{{cite news|title=Número Especial - Lo mejor de la lucha libre mexicana durante el 2004|work=SuperLuchas|id=Issue 91|date=January 24, 2005|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Four-man elimination match]] with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules.&lt;ref name="Rey1997"/&gt; There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004/&gt; The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the [[AAA Mega Championship]]. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual ''[[AAA Reina de Reinas Championship|Reina de Reinas]]'' ("Queen of Queens") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept.&lt;ref name=Reinas1999&gt;{{Cite book | author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter= Mexico: AAA Reina de Reinas | page= 400 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas12&gt;{{cite news | author = SuperLuchas staff | title = Lo Mejor de la Lucha Libre Mexicana 2008 | work =SuperLuchas | id = issue 296 | date =  January 6, 2008 | url=http://superluchas.net/?p=11145 | accessdate =  July 11, 2009| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas13&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2009/09/26/aaa-heroes-inmortales-homenaje-a-antonio-pena-resultados-en-vivo-26-septiembre-2009-%C2%BFque-pasara-con-la-lucha-entre-charly-manson-y-chessman-%C2%BFquien-sera-el-luchador-sorpresa/ | title= AAA- Héroes Inmortales III- (Resultados en vivo 26 septiembre 2009) – Cibernético gana el Trofeo Antonio Peña – Electroshock sustituye a Charly Manson contra Chessman – El luchador sorpresa fue Konan Big | author= Marquina, Alva | date= September 26, 2009 | accessdate= September 27, 2009 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2000 show was the fourth Rey de Reyes show in the series.

===Storylines===
The Rey de Reyes show featured nine [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

'''Shakespeare Festival Neuss''' is an annual theatre festival in [[Neuss]], [[Germany]]. It has taken place in a replica of the [[Globe Theater]] on the grounds of the Neuss [[Horse racing|racecourse]] since 1991.

== Globe Neuss ==
[[Image: ShakespeareFestival Globe-Neuss.jpg | thumb|Globe Theater Neuss]]
In 1988, a replica of the original London Globe Theater was built for the Landesgartenschau (''horticultural show of the state [[North Rhine-Westphalia|NRW]]'') in [[Rheda-Wiedenbrück]]. Reinhard Schiele, a theater-maker who, at the time, worked with the Schlosstheater [[Overhagen]], had the initial idea and supervised the entire project. Schiele wanted it to be as true as possible to the original, so he planned a mobile travelling theatre built entirely out of wood. This dream had to be abandoned due to [[fire protection|fire prevention regulations]]. The result was a [[dodecagon]]al theatre building made of a wood-and-steel construction that was no longer mobile. After the horticultural show ended, the theatre was not used for two years.

The city of Neuss and the ″Neusser Gemeinnützige Bauverein AG″ then acquired the building and rebuilt it on the grounds of the Neusser Galopprennbahn ([[Horse racing|racecourse]]) in 1991.

The multi-storey building, whose small windows are closed with black and white shutters, can accommodate about 500 spectators sitting on several levels. Not one seat is further than 10 meters apart from the stage. In the historical Globe Theatre there was virtually no seating at all but this would be unthinkable for today′s audiences.

== Festival ==
The festival has been held annually since 1991. In 2016 it lasted for about a month during June and July joining theatres around the world in celebration of the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare′s death. It is supervised by the cultural minister of the city of Neuss, as artistic director and production manager. The event is [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ed by a group called ''Friends of the Globe''.

The festival features an annually changing program of up to 30 performances attracting approximately 15,000 visitors. A space utilization of 90 percent is achieved.&lt;ref name ="DRK2012a"&gt;[http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/kulturheute/1802969/ "'What else can you see in London and New Delhi?' Stefan Keim accounts for the Shakespeare Festival in Neuss], [[Deutschlandradio Kultur]] from 4 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of national and international [[ensemble cast|ensembles]], the works of Shakespeare, partly in Original language, perform on the simple stage without elaborate backdrops, offers both faithful productions as well as contemporary arrangements and unconventional interpretations. The regular participants include the [[Bremen|Bremer]] Shakespeare Company and the [[Rheinisches Landestheater Neuss|Rheinische Landestheater Neuss]].

== Programme ==
[[Image: ShakespeareFestival CastleTheatreGyula.jpg | thumb | ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Burgtheater from [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]] in cooperation with the New Theater [[Budapest]] (2007)]]
* 1991: Bremer Shakespeare Company: [[The Taming of the Shrew]], [[Antony and Cleopatra]], [[The Tempest]], and [[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]
* 1992: first appearances of ''The Medieval Players [[London]]'', [[India]]n dance company Keli, the ''[[Rome|Roma]] Pralipe Theater'' and the Rheinische Landestheater Neuss
* Since 1994, Patrick Spottiswoode has appeared on London's Shakespeare's Globe, which presents regular talks on "Shakespeare and the Globe"
* In addition to frequently played pieces, lesser known works and modern arrangements were also added to the programme. In 1996 the "Théâtre le Ranelagh" from [[Paris]] presented an early Italian model for "Romeo and Juliet" in 15 [[pantomime]] clown pictures, while the "Nossa Cara" theater group from Brazil presented a "street hamlet" in 1995.
* 2007: Semi-Operas of [[Henry Purcell]]: "The Tempest", "The Fairy Queen", and "King Arthur"; developed and performed by the Rheinische Landestheater in association with the Capella Piccola (a local choir specialised on [[Early Music]]) as well as the Metamorphosis ensemble and the academy for arts and media from Cologne
* 2012: originally Afghan ''Theater Rah-e Sabz'' ("Path of Hope") performed a modern adaptation of the ''[[Comedy of Errors]]'' in context of a country devastated by decades of civil and religious war where the search for family members is no longer a mere act of comedy. The group had to relocate to India since their rehearsal room fell victim to a bomb attack.
* also in 2012: Lithuanian director [[Oskaras Koršunovas]] introduced ''Miranda'', a most unusual adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Tempest'.&lt;ref name="DRK2012a"/&gt;

Minnesota's '''Shepherd's Harvest Festival''' is the largest [[sheep]] and [[wool]] festival in Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shepherdsharvestfestival.org Shepherd's Harvest Festival Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival began in 1997 and is run entirely by volunteers with support from the Minnesota Lamb and Wool Producers Association.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020802222743/http://www.mlwp.org/calendar.htm Minnesota Lamb and Wool Producers]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Llama]] Magic is held on the fairgrounds the same weekend as Shepherd's Harvest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llamamagic.com/ Llama Magic]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is held annually, normally each Mother's Day weekend at the [[Washington County, Minnesota|Washington County]] Fairgrounds in [[Lake Elmo, Minnesota]]. The official website lists the 2014 festival as the following weekend, May 16 - 18. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Getting fleeced |url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/11491966.html |quote=A good resource for farms and shops is the Shepherd's Harvest Sheep and Wool Festival, held each Mother's Day weekend at the Washington County Fairgrounds in Lake Elmo. ... |work=[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]] |date=November 5, 2007 |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607074627/http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/11491966.html |archivedate=June 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has vendors selling a full spectrum of [[sheep]] and [[wool]] related items including fiber, yarns, spinning wheels, knitting supplies, sheep cheese, [[lanolin]], lamb burgers, vet supplies and breeding stock. It offers the only fleece competition in the state as well as hosting [[felting]], skein and photo competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dl-online.com/articles/index.cfm?id=33890&amp;section=news Detroit Lakes Tribune]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its educational component includes fiber related and sheep raising classes.

'''SuperHappyDevHouse''' (aka '''SHDH''') is an international series of social events which organizers originally conceived as parties for hackers and thinkers. Founded May 29, 2005 by [[Jeff Lindsay (computer programmer)|Jeff Lindsay]] and [[David Weekly]] (founder of [[PBwiki]]), SHDH in [[Silicon Valley]] began by hosting 150 to 200 people every six weeks at rotating venues throughout [[San Francisco Bay]] and Silicon Valley, California. The unusual name derived from a popular 1991 ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' satire, [[Happy Fun Ball]], which lampooned TV commercials and the [[NERF|NERF Ball]]. Weekly lived in a house nicknamed "SuperHappyFunHouse" after SNL's commercial parody, and that name was given yet another twist as SuperHappyDevHouse.&lt;ref name=cheree/&gt;

==Global expansion==
By 2008, SHDH had expanded globally with CocoaDevHouse (London); SuperHappyDevClub (Cambridge, UK); Cologne DevHouse (Cologne, Germany); SuperHappyDevFlat (Zurich, Switzerland); SuperHappyHackerHouse (Vancouver, Canada); SuperHappyDevHouse Aotearoa (New Zealand); PhoenixDevHouse (Arizona); BostonDevHouse (Cambridge, Massachusetts); and DevHouse Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania).&lt;ref name=cheree&gt;Watkins, Cheree Renee. "What Is SuperHappyDevHouse? Party for Hackers and Thinkers Goes Global and Celebrates SHDH25," Suite 101, May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a DevHouse in Hermosillo, Mexico in September 2008, marking the first Latin American DevHouse, followed shortly thereafter by a Mexico City DevHouse on November 1, 2008, GuadalajaraDevHouse (Guadalajara, Mexico) on September 6, 2009 and 2 years later by a Dev House on Mérida, Mexico on February 28, 2010.

People, whether technical or creative, gather at a private home for not-so-serious productivity and socialization. Organizers say they're trying to "resurrect the spirit of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]]." It's a non-exclusive event intended for passionate and creative technical people that want to have some fun, learn new things, and meet new people. There is no admission charged; the event is paid for by donations and sponsorships.

The original SHDH was in [[Hillsborough, California]] and later in [[Los Gatos, California]].

As of August 2009, SHDH spawned [[HackerDojo]] to operate a [[Hackerspace]] in [[Mountain View, CA]] to allow for 24/7 programming, hackathons, classes, workshops, and lectures. SHDH now operates as an activity of Hacker Dojo Corporation.

'''''TCB''''' is a [[1968 in music|1968]] [[television special]] produced by [[Motown|Motown Productions]] and [[George Schlatter]]–[[Ed Friendly]] Productions of ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In|Laugh-In]]'' fame. The special is a musical [[revue]] starring Motown's two most popular groups at the time, [[The Supremes|Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes]] and [[The Temptations]]. Containing a combination of [[showtune]]s, specially prepared numbers, and popular Motown hits, the special was taped before a live studio audience in September 1968 and originally broadcast December 9, 1968 on [[NBC]], sponsored by the [[Timex Group|Timex]] watch corporation. The title of the program uses a then-popular [[acronym]], "TCB", which stands for "'''T'''aking '''C'''are of '''B'''usiness".

Among the program's highlights were [[Diana Ross]]' "Afro Vogue" solo spot, [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]]' emotionally charged rendition of "[[For Once in My Life]]," a cover by both groups of the [[Aretha Franklin]] version of [[Otis Redding]]'s "[[Respect (song)|Respect]]," and then-new Temptations lead singer [[Dennis Edwards]]' lead performance on "[[(I Know) I'm Losing You]]," a song considered a signature for his predecessor, [[David Ruffin]].

Pre-empting ''Laugh-In'' on Monday night, ''TCB'' was the first musical TV special of the [[rock music|rock]] era to air on American broadcast television.&lt;ref name="TCB" /&gt; It exceeded all performance expectations, winning its timeslot in the ratings and becoming the top-rated variety show of 1968.&lt;ref name="TCB"&gt;Ribowsky, Mark (2010). Ain't Too Proud to Beg: The Troubled Lives and Enduring Soul of the Temptations. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons.{{ISBN|978-0-470-26117-0}}. Pg. 191-198.&lt;/ref&gt; A soundtrack album, ''TCB &amp;ndash; The Original Cast Soundtrack'' was released a week before the special aired on December 9 and reached #1 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top 200 albums chart]]. It also became the third #1 album for Diana Ross and The Supremes.

'''''The Smokey Robinson Show''''' was a 1970 [[Variety show|musical variety]] special starring [[The Miracles|Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles]]. It aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on December 18, 1970, and featured guest stars [[The Supremes]], [[The Temptations]], [[Stevie Wonder]], and Las Vegas singer/performer and actress [[Fran Jeffries]]. The program was sponsored by [[Faberge]] and was produced by [[Screen Gems]]. The director was Kip Walton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obOHGtc6Yjg |title=The Smokey Robinson Show (Full Program) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2015-01-02 |accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally intended to be Smokey's sendoff into a solo career, the massive success of The Miracles' 1970 # 1 smash hit, "[[The Tears of a Clown]]" delayed his departure for another 2 years (strangely, that song was not sung on the special). Filmed at the height of success of Motown Records, this special was essentially a launching pad for Smokey's solo career and to prepare the public for his upcoming departure from the legendary Miracles - the very first of the Motown groups. The Miracles, however, were not at full strength, at the time of taping: Miracle [[Warren "Pete" Moore|Pete Moore]] was absent from the special, having been sidelined by a leg injury shortly before filming, and Claudette (Mrs. Smokey) Robinson, another original Miracle, did not appear on the special. Miracle [[Marv Tarplin]] ''was'' present, but did not appear on camera. Thus, the only Miracles present were Smokey, [[Ronnie White]], and [[Bobby Rogers]], who began the show with their 1963 Top 10 smash hit "[[Mickey's Monkey]]" at the show's intro, and followed up with a medley of 3 of their greatest hits, "[[More Love (Smokey Robinson and the Miracles song)|More Love]]", "[[If You Can Want]]", and "[[I Second That Emotion]]".

==Other performances==
This hit-filled special featured the following performances:
* The Temptations sang and performed their then-current hit single, "[[Ball of Confusion]]", then joined Smokey on one of the hit songs he wrote for them, "[[Get Ready (The Temptations song)|Get Ready]]".
* The Supremes sang their first post-Diana Ross hit, "[[Up the Ladder to the Roof]]".
* Stevie Wonder performed his hit "[[My Cherie Amour (song)|My Cherie Amour]]" .
* Fran Jeffries sang and performed "Something's Coming On", and then shared vocals with Smokey and Stevie on his hit, "[[Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours]]".
* Smokey sang a medley of The Beatles' hit "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]" combined with the [[Chris Kenner]] song "Something You Got", made a hit by [[Chuck Jackson]] and [[Maxine Brown (soul singer)|Maxine Brown]], (and which appeared on The Miracles' 1970 album, "[[A Pocket Full of Miracles]]"), and then joined the rest of The Miracles in a rendition of [[The Impressions]]' [[People Get Ready (song)|People Get Ready]].
* Also notable was a "Motown Memories" segment, where the Miracles and the entire cast sat around reminiscing about Motown's early days, and did a "hits tribute" to Smokey and his composed songs for The Miracles and other Motown acts.(almost all of these songs were co-written by the other members of The Miracles, [[Bobby Rogers]], [[Warren "Pete" Moore|Pete Moore]], [[Ronnie White]], and [[Marv Tarplin]])
* The entire cast joined in for the show's finale, with The Miracles at center stage, singing and performing an exciting rendition of [[Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips|Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips']] Motown hit, "[[Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips|Friendship Train]]".

Though it was not known or considered by many in the general public at the time, this special actually marked the end of Motown's first Golden Era...{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} with several members of their most successful groups having either left those units, or were about to leave:

* [[Diana Ross]] had already left [[The Supremes]], having been replaced by [[Jean Terrell]]
* [[Smokey Robinson]] would leave his group, [[The Miracles]] about a year and a half later, to be replaced by [[Billy Griffin]]. [[Claudette Robinson]] and [[Marv Tarplin]] would exit as well.
* [[Eddie Kendricks]] and [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]] departed [[The Temptations]] the following year, and former [[The Contours|Contours]] member [[Dennis Edwards]] had already replaced [[David Ruffin]] in the group two years before.

The '''Théâtre Dejazet''' is a theatre on the [[boulevard du Temple]] (popularly known as the '[[Boulevard du Crime|boulevard du crime]]’) in the [[3rd arrondissement of Paris|3rd arrondissement]] of [[Paris]], France. It was founded in 1770 by [[Comte d'Artois]] who later was crowned Charles X. It was then closed down and not reopened until 1851.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hopstop.com/Th_tre_Dejazet-Attractions-Paris-721829118-l.html Théâtre Dejazet Rich Culture &amp; History]&lt;/ref&gt;  At that time it became a [[Café-chantant|café-concert]] called the Folies-Mayer, on the site of a former ''[[jeu de paume]]'' (tennis court).  It was converted into the '''Folies-Concertantes''' in 1853, and reopened as the '''Folies-Nouvelles''' on 21 October 1854.&lt;ref name=Lecomte28&gt;Lecomte 1905, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TKk-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA28 p. 28].&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the direction of the operetta composer [[Hervé (composer)|Hervé]] from 1854 to 1856,&lt;ref&gt;Randel, Don Michael: ''The Harvard concise dictionary of music and musicians'' p 298&lt;/ref&gt; it became a theatre for one-act ''spectacles-concerts'' with premieres of Hervé's ''La perle de l'Alsace'' (1854), ''Un compositeur toqué'' (1854), ''La fine fleur de l'Andalousie'' (1854), ''Agamemnon, ou Le chameau à deux bosses'' (1856), and ''Vadé au cabaret'' (1856). 

One of [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s first works, the ''anthropophagie musicale'' [[List of operettas by Jacques Offenbach|''Oyayaye, ou La reine des îles'']] was also performed there (1855), and two [[opérette]]s, [[Léo Delibes|Delibes]]'s ''Deux sous de charbon'' (1856), and [[Charles Lecocq|Lecocq]]'s ''Huis-Clos'' (1859). The mime [[Paul Legrand]] also regularly performed there between 1853 and 1859. The Folies-Nouvelles closed on 1 September 1859.&lt;ref name=Lecomte28/&gt;

It reopened with the name Théâtre Déjazet on 27 September 1859&lt;ref&gt;Lecomte 1905, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TKk-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA22 p. 22].&lt;/ref&gt; under the direction of the actress [[Virginie Déjazet]]. She managed it with her son Joseph Eugène Dejazet, until 1870. The theatre closed on 1 June 1870, becoming the Folies-Nouvelles again in 1871 and the Théâtre Déjazet in 1872. It was known as the '''Troisième Théâtre Français''' from 1876 to 1880, when it reverted to Folies-Nouvelles for two months, before finally becoming the Théâtre Déjazet again on 17 September 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Lecomte 1905, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TKk-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA23 p. 23].&lt;/ref&gt;

The director of the theatre is Jean Bouquin.{{when|date=November 2016}}

From 2009 to 2011, the theatre hosted the weekly seminar of the psychoanalyst [[Jacques-Alain Miller]].

The '''Ténéré Tree''' ([[French (language)|French]]: {{lang|fr|L'Arbre du Ténéré}}) was a solitary [[acacia]], of either ''[[Acacia raddiana]]''&lt;ref name="Riedacker"&gt;{{cite book|title=Physiologie des arbres et arbustes en zones arides et semi-arides: séminaire, Paris-Nancy, 20 mars-6 avril 1990|first=A.|last=Riedacker|publisher=John Libbey Eurotext|year=1993|page=406|isbn=2-7420-0019-4|accessdate=2009-08-11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mL62aLtlF2YC&amp;pg=PA406|language=French|quote=L'Hote (1961) note dans son article sur l'arbre du Ténéré (''Acacia raddiana'') que l'on aurait retrouvé ses racines à 30 métres de profondeur.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Acacia tortilis]]'',&lt;ref name="Le Roy"&gt;{{cite book|title=Méhariste au Niger: souvenirs sahariens|first=Robert|last=Le Roy|publisher=Karthala Editions|year=1998|page=108|accessdate=2009-08-11|isbn=2-86537-778-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=beEsVfvm87wC&amp;pg=PA108|language=French|quote=It avait fallu à cet ''acacia tortilis'' une belle vigueur et une fameuse chance pour subsister là, seul, jusqu'à élever son feuillage hors de portée des gazelles.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was once considered the most isolated tree on Earth&lt;ref name="Wagonsonner"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eastern Mali to Niger to Timbuktu - 2–19 September 06|first=Eric|last=Wagensonner|work=Border-Crossings|date=2007-01-15|accessdate=2009-08-11|url=http://www.border-crossings.net/site/journal/present/niger/1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;the only one for over {{convert|400|km|mi}}. It was a landmark on [[Camel train|caravan]] routes through the [[Ténéré]] region of the [[Sahara Desert]] in northeast [[Niger]], so well known that it and the Arbre Perdu or '[[Lost Tree]]' to the north are the only trees to be shown on a map at a [[scale (map)|scale]] of 1:4,000,000. The Tree of Ténéré was located near a 40-metre (131 feet)-deep well. It was knocked down in 1973, by a drunk truck driver.

==Background==
The Tree of Ténéré was the last of a group of trees that grew when the [[desert]] was less parched than it is today. The tree had stood alone for decades. During the winter of 1938&amp;ndash;1939 a well was dug near the tree and it was found that the roots of the tree reached the [[water table]] 33&amp;ndash;36 meters (108 to 118 feet) below the surface.

Commander of the [[Allied Military Mission]], Michel Lesourd, of the {{lang|fr|Service central des affaires sahariennes}} [Central service of Saharan affairs], saw the tree on May 21, 1939:
{{cquote|One must see the Tree to believe its existence. What is its secret? How can it still be living in spite of the multitudes of camels which trample at its sides. How at each [[azalai]] does not a lost camel eat its leaves and thorns? Why don't the numerous [[Tuareg people|Touareg]] leading the salt caravans cut its branches to make fires to brew their tea? The only answer is that the tree is taboo and considered as such by the caravaniers.

There is a kind of [[superstition]], a tribal order which is always respected. Each year the azalai gather round the Tree before facing the crossing of the Ténéré. The Acacia has become a living lighthouse; it is the first or the last landmark for the azalai leaving [[Agadez]] for [[Bilma]], or returning.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090302080214/http://www.the153club.org/tenere2.html L'Arbre du Ténéré, Part 2]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In his book {{lang|fr|L'épopée du Ténéré}}, French ethnologist and explorer [[Henri Lhote]] described his two journeys to the Tree of Ténéré. His first visit was in 1934 on the occasion of the first [[automobile]] crossing between [[Djanet]] and [[Agadez]]. He describes the tree as "an Acacia with a degenerative trunk, sick or ill in aspect. Nevertheless, the tree has nice green leaves, and some yellow flowers". He visited it again 25 years later, on 26 November 1959 with the [[Berliet-Ténéré]] mission, but found that it had been badly damaged after a vehicle had collided with it:
{{cquote|Before, this tree was green and with flowers; now it is a colourless thorn tree and naked. I cannot recognise it &amp;mdash; it had two very distinct trunks. Now there is only one, with a stump on the side, slashed, rather than cut a metre from the soil. What has happened to this unhappy tree? Simply, a lorry going to [[Bilma]] has struck it... but it has enough space to avoid it... the taboo, sacred tree, the one which no nomad here would have dared to have hurt with his hand... this tree has been the victim of a mechanic...&lt;ref name="taylor"/&gt;}}

==Death and replacement==
[[File:Arbre-neu1.jpg|thumb|Metal sculpture of the tree (1985)]]
[[File:Arbre-Museum-Niamey.jpg|thumb|The pavilion housing the tree's remains in Niamey]]
The Tree of Ténéré was knocked down by a drunk Libyan truck driver in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.club-des-voyages.com/niger/l-arbre-du-tenere-symbole-de-la-survie-dans-le-sahara-12208.html L'arbre du Ténéré, symbole de la survie dans le Sahara](in French)&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, 1973, the dead tree was moved to the [[Musée National du Niger|Niger National Museum]] in the capital [[Niamey]].&lt;ref name="taylor"/&gt;

It has since been replaced by a simple metal sculpture representing the tree.

==In popular culture==
The sculpture representing the Tree of Ténéré and the Tree's story feature prominently in the 2006 film ''[[La Gran final]]'' (''The Great Match''). In the film, a group of [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] nomads in the [[Sahara]] race to find a power supply and broadcast reception for their television in time to watch the [[2002 FIFA World Cup Final]] between [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], eventually using the tree sculpture as a makeshift [[television antenna|antenna]].

In 2017, Symmetry Labs created a massive, 4-story tall LED sculpture entitled "Tree of Tenere" that was showcased at Burning Man.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.treeoftenere.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture consisted of 25,000 molded leaves containing 175,000 LED's.

In 2018, the tree's story has appeared as a main theme in the official music video of 'Transmission/Michaelion'&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g70u2OrfVBE music video by Ibeyi&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Ibeyi]].

An '''urban legend''', '''urban myth''', '''urban tale''', or '''contemporary legend''' is a form of modern [[folklore]]. It usually consists of fictional stories, often presented as true, with [[macabre]] or [[humor]]ous elements, rooted in local [[popular culture]]. These legends can be used for entertainment purposes, as well as semi-serious explanations for random events such as disappearances and strange objects.

Urban legends are spread by any media, including newspapers, [[e-mail]] and [[social media]]. Some urban legends have passed through the years with only minor changes to suit regional variations. More recent legends tend to reflect modern circumstances, like the story of people ambushed and anesthetized, who awaken minus one kidney, which was supposedly [[Organ theft|surgically removed]] for [[organ transplant|transplantation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mikkelson |first=Barbara |url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/robbery/kidney.asp |title=snopes.com:Kidney Thief |publisher=''[[Snopes|Urban Legends Reference Pages]]'' |date=2008-03-12 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and structure ==
The term "urban legend," as used by folklorists, has appeared in print since at least 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2d ed. 1989, entry for "urban legend," citing R. M. Dorson in T. P. Coffin, ''Our Living Traditions'', xiv. 166 (1968). See also William B. Edgerton, ''The Ghost in Search of Help for a Dying Man'', Journal of the Folklore Institute, Vol. 5, No. 1. pp. 31, 38, 41 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan Harold Brunvand]], professor of English at the [[University of Utah]], introduced the term to the general public in a series of popular books published beginning in 1981. Brunvand used his collection of legends, ''[[The Vanishing Hitchhiker|The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends &amp; Their Meanings]]'' (1981) to make two points: first, that [[legend]]s and [[folklore]] do not occur exclusively in so-called primitive or traditional societies, and second, that one could learn much about urban and modern culture by studying such tales.

Many urban legends are framed as complete [[fable|stories]] with [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and [[Fictional character|characters]]. The compelling appeal of a typical urban legend is its elements of mystery, [[Horror (emotion)|horror]], fear or humor. Often they serve as [[cautionary tale]]s.&lt;ref name="Epoch"/&gt; Some urban legends are [[moral|morality tales]] that depict someone, usually a child, acting in a disagreeable manner, only to wind up in trouble, hurt, or dead.&lt;ref name="Epoch"&gt;{{cite news |title=Urban legends: Modern morality tales |author=Elissa Michele Zacher |newspaper=''[[The Epoch Times]]'' |date=18 July 2010 |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/39382/ |accessdate=29 August 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724140443/http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/39382/ |archivedate=24 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propagation and belief==
As Jan Brunvand points out,&lt;ref name="Death Car"&gt;{{cite web|last= Mikkelson|first= Barbara|url= http://www.snopes.com/autos/cursed/deathcar.asp|title= snopes.com: Death Car|publisher= ''Urban Legends Reference Pages''|date= 2006-08-10|accessdate= 2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; antecedent legends including some of the motifs, themes and symbolism of these [[wikt:urtext|urtexts]] can readily be identified. Cases which ''may'' have been at least partially inspired by real events include "The Death Car" (traced by [[Richard Dorson]] to [[Michigan]], [[United States]]);&lt;ref name="Death Car"/&gt; "the Solid Cement Cadillac"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.snopes.com/love/revenge/concrete.asp|title= snopes.com: Cement in Lover's Car|publisher= ''Urban Legends Reference Pages''|date= 2006-08-10|accessdate= 2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the possible origin of "[[The Hook]]" in the 1946 series of [[lovers' lane | Lovers' Lane]] murders in [[Texarkana, Texas]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Mikkelson|first= Barbara|url= http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/hook.asp|title= snopes.com: The Hook|publisher= ''Urban Legends Reference Pages''|date= 2008-06-02|accessdate= 2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Ramsland|first= Katherine|url= http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/texas_chainsaw_massa/5.html|title= Texas Chainsaw Massacre is based on a real case the crime library — Other Speculations — Crime Library on truTV.com|publisher= [[Turner Broadcasting System Inc.]]|accessdate= 2010-08-28|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090831082654/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/texas_chainsaw_massa/5.html|archivedate= 2009-08-31|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The urban legend that [[Coca-Cola]] developed the drink [[Fanta]] to sell in [[Nazi Germany]] without public backlash originated as the actual tale of German [[Max Keith]], who invented the drink and ran Coca-Cola's operations in Germany during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/fanta.asp|title= The Reich Stuff? |accessdate= 2007-01-09 |last= Mikkelson |first= Barbara|publisher= ''Urban Legends Reference Pages''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teller of an urban legend may claim it happened to a friend (or to a [[friend of a friend]]), which serves to personalize, authenticate and enhance the power of the narrative&lt;ref name="believed"&gt;Brunvand, p.423&lt;/ref&gt; while distancing the teller. Many urban legends depict horrific crimes, contaminated foods, or other situations which would potentially affect many people. Anyone believing such stories might feel compelled to warn loved ones. On occasion, news organizations, school officials and even police departments have issued warnings concerning the latest threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Gross|first= Dave|url= http://www.lycaeum.org/drugs/other/tattoo/|title= The "Blue Star" LSD Tattoo Urban Legend Page|publisher= ''the Lycaeum Drug Archives ''|accessdate= 2010-08-29|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718214538/http://www.lycaeum.org/drugs/other/tattoo/|archivedate= 2011-07-18|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the "Lights Out" rumor, [[street gang | street-gang]] members would drive without headlights until a compassionate motorist responded with the traditional flashing of headlights, whereupon a prospective new gang-member would have to murder the citizen as a requirement of [[initiation]].&lt;ref name="Snopes lights"&gt;{{cite web|last= Mikkelson|first= Barbara|url= http://www.snopes.com/crime/gangs/lightsout.asp|title= snopes.com: Flashing Headlights Gang Initiation|publisher= ''Urban Legends Reference Pages''|date= 2008-12-08|accessdate= 2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fax received at the [[Nassau County, Florida]] fire department was forwarded to police, and from there to all city departments. Even the [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of Defence for Canada]] was taken in by the same legend; he forwarded an urgent security warning to all [[Ontario]] Members of Parliament.&lt;ref name="Snopes lights"/&gt;

Many urban legends are essentially extended [[joke]]s, told as if they were true events.&lt;ref&gt;Brunvand, p.223&lt;/ref&gt; Urban legends typically include common elements: the legend is retold on behalf of the original witness or participant; dire warnings are often given for those who might not heed the advice or lesson contained therein (this forms a typical element of many e-mail [[phishing]] scams); and the tale is often touted as "something a friend told me", while the friend is identified by first name only or not identified at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6090918.stm | work= BBC News | title= Heard the one about... | date= 2006-10-27 | accessdate= 2010-03-28 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090604154846/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6090918.stm | archivedate= 2009-06-04 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persistent urban legends often maintain a degree of plausibility, such as a [[serial killer]] deliberately hiding in the back seat of a car. One such example since the 1970s has been the recurring rumor that the [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] Company was associated with [[Satan worship|Satan-worship]]pers because of details within its nineteenth-century trademark.&lt;ref&gt;''Procter and Gamble v. Amway'' 242 F.3d 539&lt;/ref&gt; The legend interrupted the company's business to the point that it stopped using the trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Brunvand, p.333&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belief and relation to mythology==
The earliest term by which these narratives were known, "urban belief tales", highlights what was then thought of{{by whom?|date=August 2018}} as a key property: their tellers regarded the stories as true accounts, and the device of the [[Friend of a friend | FOAF]] (acronym for "Friend Of A Friend" invented by English writer and folklorist [[Rodney Dale]] in 1976) was a spurious but significant effort at authentication.&lt;ref&gt;Brunvand, p. 459&lt;/ref&gt; The coinage leads in turn to the terms "FOAFlore" and "FOAFtale". While at least one classic legend, the "Death Car", has been shown to have some basis in fact,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dorson. "American Folklore" University of Chicago Press, 1959, pp. 250-52.&lt;/ref&gt; folklorists have an interest in debunking these narratives only to the degree that establishing non-factuality warrants the assumption that there must be some other reason why the tales are told, re-told and believed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Adam Brooke Davis. "[http://missourifolkloresociety.truman.edu/Missouri%20Folklore%20Studies/devilsnight.htm Davis, Adam Brooke. "Devil's Night and Hallowe'en: The Linked Fates of Two Folk Festivals." Missouri Folklore Society Journal XXIV(2002) 69-82] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160305105514/http://missourifolkloresociety.truman.edu/Missouri%20Folklore%20Studies/devilsnight.htm |date= 2016-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the case of [[myth]], these narratives are believed because they construct and reinforce the [[worldview]] of the group within which they are told, or "because they provide us with coherent and convincing explanations of complex events".&lt;ref&gt;John Mosier "WAR MYTHS" Historically Speaking: The Bulletin of the Historical Society: VI: 4, March/April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently,{{when?|date=August 2018}} social scientists have started to draw on urban legends in order to help explain complex socio-psychological beliefs, such as attitudes to [[crime]], [[childcare]], [[fast food]], [[SUVs]] and other "family" choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Croft |first= Robin |year= 2006 |title= Folklore, Families and Fear: Exploring the Influence of the Oral Tradition on Consumer Decision-making |journal= Journal of Marketing Management |volume= 22 |issue= 9 &amp; 10 |pages= 1053–1076 |url= |doi= 10.1362/026725706778935574 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the authors make an explicit connection between urban legends and popular folklore, such as ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]'', where similar themes and motifs arise. For this reason, it is characteristic of groups within which a given narrative circulates to react very negatively to claims or demonstrations of non-factuality; an example would be the expressions of outrage by police officers who are told that adulteration of Halloween treats by strangers (the subject of periodic [[moral panic]]s) occurs extremely rarely, if at all.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The Internet makes it easier to both spread urban legends and debunk them.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing, tracking, and analyzing urban legends is the topic of the [[Usenet]] newsgroup, ''alt.folklore.urban'' and several web sites, most notably [[snopes.com]]. The [[United States Department of Energy]] had a service, now discontinued, called Hoaxbusters, that dealt with computer-distributed [[hoax]]es and legends.

Television shows such as ''[[Urban Legends (TV series)|Urban Legends]]'', ''[[Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction]]'', and later ''[[Mostly True Stories: Urban Legends Revealed]]'', feature re-enactments of urban legends detailing the accounts of the tales and (typically) later in the show, these programs reveal any factual basis they may have. The [[Discovery Channel]] TV show ''[[MythBusters]]'' (2003–2016) tried to prove or disprove urban legends by attempting to reproduce them using the [[scientific method]].

The 1998 film ''[[Urban Legend (film)|Urban Legend]]'' featured students discussing popular urban legends while at the same time falling victim to them.

Between 1992 and 1998, ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper "Weekend" section published the illustrated "Urban Myths" column by Phil Healey and Rick Glanvill, with content taken from a series of four books: ''Urban Myths'', ''The Return Of Urban Myths'', ''Urban Myths Unplugged'', and ''Now! That's What I Call Urban Myths''. The 1994 comics anthology the ''[[Big Book of Urban Legends]]'', written by Robert Boyd, [[Jan Harold Brunvand]], and [[Robert Loren Fleming]], collected two hundred urban legends told in comics form.

The British writer [[Tony Barrell (journalist)|Tony Barrell]] has explored urban legends in a long-running column in ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. These include the story that [[Orson Welles]] began work on a [[Batman]] movie in the 1940s, which was to feature [[James Cagney]] as the [[Riddler]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]] as [[Catwoman]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tony Barrell |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/film_and_tv/film/article176017.ece |title=Did You Know: Orson Welles |publisher=The Sunday Times |date=2009-07-05 |accessdate=2012-03-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222142755/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/film_and_tv/film/article176017.ece |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the persistent rumour that the rock singer [[Courtney Love]] is the granddaughter of [[Marlon Brando]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tony Barrell |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/music/article184306.ece |title=Did You Know: Courtney Love |publisher=The Sunday Times |date=2009-09-13 |accessdate=2012-03-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222142758/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/music/article184306.ece |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the idea that in a famous 1970s poster of [[Farrah Fawcett]], there is a subliminal sexual message concealed in the actress' hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tony Barrell |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/film_and_tv/tv/article186376.ece |title=Did You Know: Farrah Fawcett |publisher=The Sunday Times |date=2009-10-04 |accessdate=2012-03-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222142752/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/film_and_tv/tv/article186376.ece |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==
Internet urban legends are [[folklore]] stories that are spread through the internet. They may be spread through [[Usenet]] or [[email]],&lt;ref name=frost&gt;Chris Frost, (2000) ..Tales on the Internet: making it up as you go along'', Aslib Proceedings, Vol. 52 Iss: 1, pp.5 - 10&lt;/ref&gt; or more recently by [[social media]].

===Types===
;Crime stories
:As with traditional urban legends, many Internet rumors are about crimes either fictional, or based on real events but blown out of proportion.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Donovan, No Way of Knowing: Crime, Urban Legends, and the Internet (Psychology Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Donovan, ''Crime legends in a new medium: Fact, fiction and loss of authority'', Theoretical Criminology; vol. 6 no. 2; May 2002; Pp. 189-215&lt;/ref&gt;
;Chain email letters
:[[Chain letter]]s are a variety of urban legends concerning e-mails that tell the reader to make copies of, and redistribute, the e-mail or they will meet a terrible fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Chain Linked| url=http://www.snopes.com/luck/chain.asp| work=Snopes.com| accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Fake virus and malware alerts
:[[Virus hoax|Fake virus alerts]], telling people of non-existent threats to their computer, are commonly distributed by email.&lt;ref name=frost/&gt;

===Use in marketing===
The capacity of the internet to spread rumors has been used in marketing, for instance with the low-budget film ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', which was advertised as if it were about a genuine urban legend, rather than a work of original fiction.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Telotte, "The Blair Witch Project Project: Film and the Internet", Film Quarterly, Vol. 54, No. 3; (Spring 2001), pp. 32-39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Golden hour graph.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Critical windows in emergency medicine]]

A '''window of opportunity''' (also called a '''margin of opportunity''' or '''critical window''') is a period of time during which some action can be taken that will achieve a desired outcome. Once this period is over, or the "window has closed", the specified outcome is no longer possible.&lt;ref name="Sull"/&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of windows of opportunity include:
*The '''[[critical period]]''' in the development of an organism, during which [[neuroplasticity]] is greatest and key neurological functions, such as [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] and [[language]], are acquired which may be impossible to acquire at a later stage&lt;ref name="Robson"/&gt;
*The '''[[golden hour (medicine)|golden hour]]''' or '''golden time''', used in [[emergency medicine]] to describe the period following traumatic injury in which life-saving treatment is likely to be successful&lt;ref name="ACS"/&gt;
*'''[[Market opportunity|Market opportunities]]''', in which one may be positioned to take advantage of a gap in a particular [[market (economics)|market]],&lt;ref name="boundless"/&gt;&lt;ref name="investopedia"/&gt; the timing of which may depend on the activities of customers, competitors, and other market context factors&lt;ref name="Sull"/&gt;
*'''[[Sowing|Planting]] and [[harvest]]ing seasons''', in agriculture
*'''Space [[launch window|launch]] and [[orbital maneuver|maneuver]] windows''', which are determined by [[orbital dynamics]] and constrained by [[rocket propellant|fuel]]/[[delta-v]] budgets&lt;ref name="Heiney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wheeler"/&gt;
*The theorized '''[[tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]]''' in climatology, after which the Earth's climate is predicted to shift to a new stable equilibrium&lt;ref name="ipcc"/&gt;

==Variations==
===Timing===
The length of a critical window may be well known (as in the case of launch windows) or poorly known (in the case of medical emergencies or climate change). In some cases, there may be multiple windows during which a goal can be achieved.

===Automation===
In situations with very brief or unpredictable windows of opportunity, [[automation]] may be employed to take advantage of these windows, as in [[algorithmic trading]].&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt; [[Real-time computing]] systems can guarantee responses on the order of milliseconds or less.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ari-pg164"/&gt;

===Costs===
In some time-critical situations, failure to act may entail a continuously increasing cost over time, or a continuously decreasing probability over time of achieving the desired outcome. This may be represented in real-time computing systems by [[time-utility function]]s.

===Use as a marketing tactic===
In some cases, critical windows may be artificially imposed (or even falsely implied) as a [[marketing]] tactic to encourage action, in what is known as a "limited time offer".&lt;ref name="adage"/&gt;
