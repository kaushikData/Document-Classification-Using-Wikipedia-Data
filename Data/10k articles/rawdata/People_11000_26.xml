'''Ambrose Gwinnett Bierce''' (June 24, 1842{{Sfn |Floyd |1999|p = 18}} – circa 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Fantasy and Horror Fiction|last=D'Ammassa|first=Don|publisher=Facts On File, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an American short story writer, journalist, poet, and Civil War veteran.

Bierce's book ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]'' was named as one of "The 100 Greatest Masterpieces of American Literature" by the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.leatherboundtreasure.com/american_literature.html Franklin Library 100 Greatest Masterpieces of American Literature 1976 – 1984]", Leather Bound Treasure.&lt;/ref&gt;  His story "[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]" has been described as "one of the most famous and frequently anthologized stories in American literature";&lt;ref&gt;"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge: Ambrose Bierce." ''Short Story Criticism'', v. 72, Joseph Palmisano, ed. Farmington Hills, MI: Thomson Gale, 2004, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and his book ''[[Tales of Soldiers and Civilians]]'' (also published as ''In the Midst of Life'') was named by the [[Grolier Club]] as one of the 100 most influential American books printed before 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Frederick B.; Winterich, John T.; Johnson, Thomas H.; and McKay, George L. ''One Hundred Influential American Books Printed Before 1900: Catalogue and Addresses''. New York: The Grolier Club, 1947, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

A prolific and versatile writer, Bierce was regarded as one of the most influential journalists in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Grenander, M. E. ''Ambrose Bierce'', Boston: Twayne, 1971, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mundt, Whitney R., "Ambrose Bierce" in ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'' v. 23: ''American Newspaper Journalists, 1873-1900'', Ashley, Perry J., ed., Detroit: Gale Research, 1983, p. 25.

P. Lovecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Dirda|Dirda, Michael]], "Thirteen for Halloween", ''The American Scholar'', Oct. 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His war stories influenced [[Stephen Crane]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], and others,&lt;ref&gt;[[S. T. Joshi|Joshi, S. T.]] in Kelley, Rich, "The Library of America interviews S. T. Joshi about Ambrose Bierce," ''The Library of America e-Newsletter'', Sept. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was considered an influential and feared literary critic.&lt;ref&gt;Grenander, M. E., "Ambrose Bierce" in ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'' v. 71: ''American Literary Critics and Scholars, 1880-1900'', Rathbun, John W. and Grecu, Monica M., eds., Detroit: Gale Research, 1988, pp. 27-37.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades Bierce has gained wider respect as a [[fabulist]] and for his poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Joshi, S. T., "Introduction," ''The Collected Fables of Ambrose Bierce'', Columbus, OH: Ohio State University Press, 2000, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grenander, M. E., "Introduction" to ''Poems of Ambrose Bierce'', Lincoln and London: University of Nebraska Press, 1995, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1913, Bierce traveled to [[Chihuahua City|Chihuahua]], Mexico, to gain first-hand experience of the [[Mexican Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Bierce letter from Chihuahua to Blanche Partington dated December 26, 1913. Printed in ''A Much Misunderstood Man: Selected Letters of Ambrose Bierce'', [[S. T. Joshi]] and David E. Schultz, eds. Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 2003, pp. 244-246.&lt;/ref&gt; He disappeared, and was rumored to be traveling with rebel troops. He was never seen again.

==Early life==
Bierce was born in a log cabin at Horse Cave Creek in [[Meigs County, Ohio|Meigs County]], [[Ohio]], on June 24, 1842, to Marcus Aurelius Bierce (1799–1876) and Laura Sherwood Bierce.{{Sfn | Floyd | 1999 | p = 18}}  He was of entirely English ancestry: all of his forebears came to North America between 1620 and 1640 as part of the Great Puritan Migration.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose Bierce: Alone in Bad Company By Roy Morris&lt;/ref&gt;  He often wrote critically of both "Puritan values" and people who "made a fuss" about genealogy.&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce, Volume 8 Epigrams, On With the Dance, Negligible Tales&lt;/ref&gt; He was the tenth of thirteen children,  all of whom were given names by their father beginning with the letter "A": in order of birth, the Bierce siblings were Abigail, Amelia, Ann, Addison, Aurelius, Augustus, Almeda, Andrew, Albert, and Ambrose.&lt;ref&gt;An Ambrose Bierce Companion By Robert L. Gale pg. 31&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was a descendant of [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|William Bradford]].&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose Bierce: Alone in Bad Company By Roy Morris pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

His parents were a poor but literary couple who instilled in him a deep love for books and writing.{{Sfn | Floyd | 1999 |p = 18}} Bierce grew up in [[Kosciusko County, Indiana|Kosciusko County]], [[Indiana]], attending [[high school]] at the [[county seat]], [[Warsaw, Indiana|Warsaw]].

He left home at 15 to become a [[printer's devil]] at a small [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] Ohio newspaper, the ''Northern Indianan''.{{Sfn | Floyd | 1999 |p = 18}}

==Military career==
At the outset of the [[American Civil War]], Bierce enlisted in the [[Union Army|Union Army's]] [[9th Indiana Infantry Regiment|9th Indiana Infantry]]. He participated in the [[operations in Western Virginia]] (1861), was present at the [[Battle of Philippi (West Virginia)|Battle of Philippi]] (the first organized land action of the war), and received newspaper attention for his daring rescue, under fire, of a gravely wounded comrade at the [[Battle of Rich Mountain]]. Bierce fought at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] (April 1862), a terrifying experience that became a source for several short stories and the [[memoir]] "What I Saw of Shiloh".

In April 1863 he was commissioned a [[First Lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]], and served on the staff of General [[William Babcock Hazen]] as a [[Cartography|topographical engineer]], making maps of likely battlefields.&lt;ref name="JimMcWilliams"&gt;{{cite news |last1=McWilliams |first1=Jim |title=Ambrose Bierce’s Civil War |url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/ambrose-bierces-civil-war/ |accessdate=16 August 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a staff officer, Bierce became known to leading generals such as [[George H. Thomas]] and [[Oliver O. Howard]], both of whom supported his application for admission to West Point in May 1864. General Hazen believed Bierce would graduate from the military academy "with distinction" and William T. Sherman also endorsed the application for admission even though stating he had no personal acquaintance with Bierce.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, RG 94, Entry243, Microfilm M688, Roll 235&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1864, Bierce sustained a serious [[Head injury|head wound]] at the [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url = http://www.ambrosebierce.org/timeline2.html|type = timeline|contribution = 1861–67. The Civil War|title = The Ambrose Bierce Project}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and spent the rest of the summer on [[furlough]], returning to active duty in September. He was discharged from the army in January 1865.

His military career resumed, however, in mid-1866, when he joined General Hazen as part of an expedition to inspect military outposts across the [[Great Plains]]. The expedition traveled  by horseback and wagon from [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], arriving toward year's end in [[San Francisco]], California.

==Personal life==
[[File:Ambrose Bierce-1.jpg|thumb|upright|Ambrose Bierce, by [[Manchester School of Painters#John Herbert Evelyn Partington|J.H.E. Partington]]]]
Bierce married Mary Ellen "Mollie" Day on December 25, 1871. They had three children: sons Day (1872–1889){{Sfn | Floyd | 1999 | p = 19}} and Leigh (1874–1901){{Sfn | Floyd | 1999 | p = 19}} and daughter Helen (1875–1940). Both of Bierce's sons died before he did. Day committed suicide after a romantic rejection,{{Sfn | Morris | 1999 | pp =206–08, 238}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Along the Pacific Coast |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014381/1889-07-27/ed-1/seq-1 |newspaper=[[The Sacramento Union|Sacramento Daily Record-Union]] |date=July 27, 1889 |page=1 |accessdate=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Leigh died of [[pneumonia]] related to [[alcoholism]].{{Sfn | Floyd | 1999 | p = 19}} Bierce separated from his wife in 1888, after discovering compromising letters to her from an admirer. They divorced in 1904.{{Sfn | Floyd | 1999 | p = 19}} Mollie Day Bierce died the following year.

Bierce was an avowed [[Agnosticism|agnostic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ambrose Bierce's Civilians and soldiers in context: a critical study|year=2004|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=9780873387781|page=323|author=Donald T. Blume|chapter=The Boarded Window|quote=Contrary to McWilliams's claim; however, in the public arena Bierce was not merely an agnostic, but a staunch unbeliever regarding the question of Jesus' divinity.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 April 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered from lifelong [[asthma]],{{Sfn | Floyd | 1999 |pp = 19–20}} as well as complications from his war wounds.&lt;ref name="online-literature.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.online-literature.com/bierce/|title=Ambrose Bierce|publisher=The Literarure Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalism==
In [[San Francisco]], Bierce was awarded the rank of [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Major (United States)|major]] before resigning from the Army. He remained in San Francisco for many years, eventually becoming famous as a contributor or editor of a number of local newspapers and periodicals, including ''[[The San Francisco News Letter]]'', ''[[The Argonaut]]'', the ''[[Overland Monthly]]'', ''[[The Californian (1880s magazine)|The Californian]]'' and ''[[The Wasp (magazine)|The Wasp]]''. A selection of his crime reporting from ''The San Francisco News Letter'' was included in [[The Library of America]] anthology ''True Crime''.

Bierce lived and wrote in [[England]] from 1872 to 1875, contributing to ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' magazine. His first book, ''The Fiend's Delight'', a compilation of his articles, was published in London in 1873 by [[John Camden Hotten]] under the pseudonym "Dod Grile".{{Sfn | Bierce | 2003 | p = 8}}{{Sfn | Morris | 1999 | p = 143}}

Returning to the United States, he again took up residence in San Francisco. From 1879 to 1880, he traveled to [[Rockerville, South Dakota|Rockerville]] and [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]] in the [[Dakota Territory]], to try his hand as local manager for a New York [[mining]] company. When the company failed he returned to San Francisco and resumed his career in [[journalism]].

From January 1, 1881 until September 11, 1885 he was editor of ''The Wasp'' magazine, in which he began a column titled "Prattle". He also became one of the first regular columnists and editorialists on [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s newspaper, ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'',{{Sfn | Floyd | 1999 |p = 18}} eventually becoming one of the most prominent and influential writers and journalists{{Citation needed|date = July 2015}} of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. He remained associated with [[Hearst Newspapers]] until 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Student's Encyclopedia of Great American Writers: 1830 to 1900|last=Joshi|first=S. T.|publisher=Facts On File, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|volume=vol. 2|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railroad refinancing bill===
The [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] and [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] railroad companies had received large, low-interest loans from the U.S. government to build the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. Central Pacific executive [[Collis P. Huntington]] persuaded a friendly member of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to introduce a bill excusing the companies from repaying the loans, amounting  to $130 million (worth ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|130000000|1895}}}} today).
[[File:NE corner of Logan Circle.jpg|thumb|Bierce's residence (right), 18 [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

In January 1896 Hearst dispatched Bierce to [[Washington, D.C.]] to foil this attempt. The essence of the plot was secrecy; the railroads' advocates hoped to get the bill through Congress without any public notice or hearings. When the angered Huntington confronted Bierce on the steps of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] and told Bierce to name his price, Bierce's answer ended up in newspapers nationwide: "My price is one hundred thirty million dollars. If, when you are ready to pay, I happen to be out of town, you may hand it over to my friend, the Treasurer of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Beam |first=Alex |title=Ambrose Bierce, mon amour |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2008/06/24/ambrose_bierce_mon_amour/ |date=June 24, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |accessdate=April 5, 2015}}{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bierce's coverage and diatribes on the subject aroused such public wrath that the bill was defeated. Bierce returned to California in November.

===McKinley accusation===

Because of his penchant for biting social criticism and satire, Bierce's long newspaper career was often steeped in controversy. On several occasions his columns stirred up a storm of hostile reaction, which created difficulties for Hearst. One of the most notable of these incidents occurred following the [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassination]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[William McKinley]], when Hearst's opponents turned a poem Bierce had written about the assassination of Governor [[William Goebel]] of [[Kentucky]] in 1900 into a ''[[cause célèbre]]''.

Bierce meant his poem to express a national mood of dismay and fear, but after McKinley was shot in 1901, it seemed to foreshadow the crime:

{{quote |&lt;poem&gt;The bullet that pierced Goebel's breast
Can not be found in all the West;
Good reason, it is speeding here
To stretch McKinley on his bier.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Hearst was thereby accused by rival newspapers—and by then-[[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Elihu Root]]—of having called for McKinley's assassination. Despite a national uproar that ended his ambitions for the presidency (and even his membership in the [[Bohemian Club]]), Hearst kept employing Bierce.{{Sfn | Morris | 1999 | pp = 236–37}}

==Literary works==
[[File:Ambrose Bierce 1892-10-07.jpg|thumb|upright|Bierce, 1892]]
During his lifetime, Bierce was better known as a journalist than as a fiction writer.  His most popular stories were written in rapid succession between 1888 and 1891, in what was characterized as "a tremendous burst of consummate art".&lt;ref&gt;M. E. Grenander. ''Ambrose Bierce''. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1971. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Bierce's works often highlight the inscrutability of the universe and the [[black humor|absurdity of death]].&lt;ref name="ye qi"&gt;Ye Qi. ''Megashift from Plot to Character In American Short Fiction''. {{ISBN|9780983875369}}. p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.worldbookonline.com/advanced/article?id=ar058780&amp;st=ambrose+bierce#tab=homepage|title = Bierce, Ambrose|date = 2016|access-date = 15 Jan 2016|website = World Book Advanced|publisher = World Book|last = Curran|first = Ronald T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bierce wrote realistically of the terrible things he had seen in the [[American Civil War|war]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ambrose Bierce's Civil War|url = http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/ambrose-bierces-civil-war/?_r=0|website = Opinionator|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in such stories as "[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]", "[[A Horseman in the Sky]]", "[[One of the Missing]]", and "[[s:Chickamauga|Chickamauga]]". His grimly realistic cycle of 25 war stories has been called "the greatest anti-war document in American literature".&lt;ref&gt;A. Teodorescu. ''Death Representations in Literature''. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2015. {{ISBN|9781443872980}}. p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Milton Subotsky]], Bierce helped pioneer the [[psychological horror]] story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Horror: 100 Best Books|last = |first = |publisher = Carroll and Graf|year = 1990|isbn = 0881845949|location = New York|page = 74|editor-last = Jones|editor-first = Stephen|editor-last2 = Newman|editor-first2 = Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his ghost and war stories, he also published several volumes of poetry.  His ''Fantastic Fables'' anticipated the ironic style of [[grotesquerie]] that became a more common genre in the 20th century.

One of Bierce's most famous works is his much-quoted ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]'', originally an occasional newspaper item, first published in book form in 1906 as ''The Cynic's Word Book.'' Described as "howlingly funny",&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Roy. ''Ambrose Bierce: Alone in Bad Company''. Oxford University Press, 1995, p.183.&lt;/ref&gt; it consists of satirical definitions of English words which lampoon [[cant (language)|cant]] and political double-talk. Bierce edited the twelve volumes of ''The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce'', which were published from 1909 to 1912. The seventh volume consists solely of ''The Devil's Dictionary''.

Bierce has been criticized by his contemporaries and later scholars for deliberately pursuing improbability and for his penchant toward "[[plot twist|trick endings]]".&lt;ref name="ye qi"/&gt; In his later stories, apparently under the influence of [[Maupassant]], Bierce "dedicated himself to shocking the audience", as if his purpose was "to attack the reader's smug intellectual security".&lt;ref&gt;Fusco, Richard. ''Maupassant and the American Short Story: The Influence of Form at the Turn of the Century.'' Penn State University Press, 2010. {{ISBN|9780271041124}}. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bierce's bias towards [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] has also been noted:&lt;ref&gt;Judy Cornes. ''Madness and the Loss of Identity in Nineteenth Century Fiction''. McFarland, 2007. {{ISBN|9780786432240}}. p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; "The biting, deriding quality of his satire, unbalanced by any compassion for his targets, was often taken as petty meanness, showing contempt for humanity and an intolerance to the point of merciless cruelty".&lt;ref&gt;H. Hendin, A. O. Haas. "Posttraumatic Stress Disorders in Veterans of Early American Wars." ''Psychohistory Review'' 12 (1984): 25–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Crane]] was of the minority of Bierce's contemporaries who valued Bierce's experimental short stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Complete Short Stories of Ambrose Bierce|last = Bierce|first = Ambrose|publisher = University of Nebraska Press|year = 1984|isbn = 0803260717|location = |page= 5|others = Compiled with Commentary by Ernest Jerome Hopkins; Foreword by [[Cathy Davidson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his essay "[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]", [[H. P. Lovecraft]] characterized Bierce's fictional work as "grim and savage."  Lovecraft goes on to say that nearly all of Bierce's stories are of the [[Horror fiction|horror genre]] and some shine as great examples of [[weird fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:s:Supernatural Horror in Literature/The Weird Tradition in America]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[William Dean Howells]] said, "Mr. Bierce is among our three greatest writers." When told this, Bierce responded, "I am sure Mr. Howells is the other two."&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, Carey. ''Ambrose Bierce: A Biography''. Hamden, CT: Archon Books, 1967, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
In October 1913, Bierce, then age 71, departed from [[Washington, D.C.]] for a tour of his old [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battlefields. By December he had passed through [[Louisiana]] and [[Texas]], crossing by way of [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] into Mexico, which was in the throes of [[Mexican Revolution|revolution]]. In [[Ciudad Juárez]] he joined [[Pancho Villa]]'s army as an observer, and in that role he witnessed the [[Battle of Tierra Blanca]].&lt;ref name=Texas&gt;{{cite book|last1=Varhola|first1=Michael|title=Texas Confidential: Sex, Scandal, Murder, and Mayhem in the Lone Star State|date=2011|publisher=Clerisy Press|location=Cincinnati|isbn=1578604583|page=176|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bierce is known to have accompanied Villa's army as far as the city of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]]. His last known communication with the world was a letter he wrote there to [[Blanche Partington]], a close friend, dated December 26, 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Vincent Starrett| last = Starrett | first = Vincent | title = Ambrose Bierce | publisher = WM Hill | year = 1920 | p = 39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Bierce | 2003 | pp = 244f}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Day |first=Leon |title=My Hunt For Ambrose Bierce |url=http://www.donswaim.com/bierce.leon.day-6.html |date=August 8, 2007 |website=The Ambrose Bierce Site |access-date=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After closing this letter by saying, "As to me, I leave here tomorrow for an unknown destination," he vanished without a trace, [[list of people who disappeared mysteriously|his disappearance]] becoming one of the most famous in American literary history. Skeptic [[Joe Nickell]] argued that no letter had ever been found;{{Sfn | Nickell | 1992}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=October 2012}} all that existed was a notebook belonging to his secretary and companion, Carrie Christiansen, containing a rough summary of a purported letter and her statement that the originals had been destroyed.

There was an official investigation by U.S. consular officials of the disappearance of one of its citizens. Some of Villa's men were questioned at the time of his disappearance and afterwards, with contradictory accounts.  Pancho Villa's representative in the U.S., [[Felix A. Sommerfeld]], was contacted by U.S. chief of staff [[Hugh L. Scott]] and Sommerfeld investigated the disappearance.  Bierce was said to have been last seen in the city of Chihuahua in January.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Katz, ''The Life and Times of Pancho Villa'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1998, p. 865.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oral tradition in [[Sierra Mojada]], [[Coahuila]], documented by a priest named James Lienert, states that Bierce was [[Execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] in the town cemetery there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://donswaim.com/bierce-lienert.html | title = The Ambrose Bierce Site | contribution = Monument in the Sierra Mojada cemetery | first = James | last = Lienert | year = 2004}}, with inscription stating that Bierce was shot there.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nickell{{Sfn | Nickell | 1992}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=October 2012}} finds this story to be unreliable. He quotes Bierce's friend and biographer Walter Neale as saying that Bierce had not ridden for quite some time, was suffering from serious [[asthma]], and had been severely critical of Pancho Villa. Neale concludes that it would have been highly unlikely for Bierce to have gone to Mexico and joined Villa.

All investigations into his fate have proven fruitless, and Nickell concedes{{Sfn | Nickell | 1992}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=October 2012}} that despite a lack of hard evidence that Bierce had gone to Mexico, there is also none that he had not. Therefore, despite an abundance of theories (including death by suicide), his ultimate fate remains shrouded in mystery.

==Legacy and influence==
[[File:Ambrose Bierce small.jpg|thumb|left|Bierce and [[autograph]]]]

Bierce has been fictionalized in more than 50 novels, short stories, movies, television shows, stage plays, and comic books. Most of these works draw upon Bierce's vivid personality, colorful wit, relationships with famous people such as [[Jack London]] or [[William Randolph Hearst]], or, quite frequently, his mysterious disappearance.

Bierce has been portrayed by such well-known authors as [[Ray Bradbury]],&lt;ref&gt;'''[[Ray Bradbury|Bradbury, Ray]] (1949) "The Mad Wizards of Mars,"''' ''Maclean’s'', Sept. 15; revised as '''"The Exiles,"''' ''Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction'', v. 1 n. 2, Winter-Spring 1950; revised again and included in ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'' (1951). Print. Bierce assists [[Edgar Allan Poe]], other fantasy writers, and their fictional characters--all exiled to Mars because Earth has forbidden and destroyed every fantasy book--in a last-ditch attempt to prevent an expedition from Earth from obliterating them.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Finney]],&lt;ref&gt;'''[[Jack Finney|Finney, Jack]] (1955) "[[Of Missing Persons]],"''' ''Good Housekeeping'', March. Print. In one of Finney's most often reprinted stories, Bierce is mentioned but never seen. Nevertheless, he plays an important symbolic role. A man tells about his visit to a seemingly ordinary travel agency that secretly arranges for discontented people to leave Earth and travel to the utopian planet of Verna. Bierce is the only specific character named as having disappeared from Earth to move to Verna, and his activities and new home on Verna are described.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlos Fuentes]], [[Winston Groom]], [[Robert Heinlein]], and Don Swaim. Some works featuring a fictional Ambrose Bierce have received favorable reviews, generated international sales,&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Deborah A., "Best Sellers". ''Encyclopedia of Latin American Literature'', Smith, Verity, ed. London and Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; or earned major awards.

Bierce's short stories, "Haita the Shepherd" and "[[An Inhabitant of Carcosa]]" are believed to have influenced early weird fiction writer [[Robert W. Chambers]]' tales of [[The King in Yellow]] (1895), which featured [[Hastur]], [[Carcosa]], Lake Hali and other names and locations initiated in these tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Horror Literature through History: An Encyclopedia of the Stories that Speak to Our Deepest Fears |page=513 |author=Lee Weinstein |chapter=The King in Yellow |editor=Matt Cardin |date=2017 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781440842023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chambers in turn went on to influence [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and much of modern horror fiction.

In 1918, [[H. L. Mencken]] called Bierce "the one genuine wit that These States have ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;"Suite Elegiaque," ''Smart Set'' v. 57 n. 2 (October 1918), p. 144; reprinted in ''H. L. Mencken on American Literature'', [[S. T. Joshi]], ed., Athens, OH: Ohio University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least three films have been made of Bierce's story "[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]". A silent film version, ''The Bridge'', was made in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Vidor|first=Charles|title=The Bridge|date=2009-09-22|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019723/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1|accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A French version called ''La Rivière du Hibou'', directed by [[Robert Enrico]], was released in 1962;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Enrico|first=Robert|title=Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge|date=1962-05-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056300/|accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; this black-and-white film faithfully recounts the original narrative using voiceover. It aired in 1964 on American television as one of the final episodes of the [[television series]] ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'': "[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (film)|An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Enrico|first=Robert|title=An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge|date=1964-02-28|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0734554/?ref_=tttr_tr_tt|accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to ''The Twilight Zone'', the story had been adapted as an episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Stevenson|first=Robert|title=An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge|date=2000-01-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0508121/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_40|accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another version, directed by Brian James Egen, was released in 2005. It was also adapted for the CBS radio programs ''[[Suspense (radio drama)|Suspense]]'' and ''[[Escape (radio program)|Escape]]''.

In his 1932 book ''[[Wild Talents]]'', American writer and researcher into anomalous phenomena [[Charles Fort]] wrote about the unexplained disappearances of Ambrose Bierce and [[Ambrose Small]], and asked, "Was somebody collecting Ambroses?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anomalist.com/fort2.html#Collecting|title=The Quotable Fort: Part 2|publisher=|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor James Lanphier (1920-1969) played Bierce, with [[James Hampton (actor)|James Hampton]] as [[William Randolph Hearst]], in the 1964 episode "The Paper Dynasty", of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]] ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Stanley Andrews]]. In the story line, Hearst struggles to turn a profit despite increased circulation of ''The San Francisco Examiner''. [[Robert O. Cornthwaite]] appears as Sam Chamberlain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556854/|title=The Paper Dynasty on ''Death Valley Days''|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|date=March 1, 1964|accessdate=August 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carlos Fuentes]]'s 1985 novel ''[[The Old Gringo]]'' is a fictionalized account of Bierce's disappearance; it was later adapted into the film ''[[Old Gringo]]'' (1989), starring [[Gregory Peck]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlos Fuentes|Fuentes, Carlos]], ''Gringo Viejo'' (Planeta, 2004) {{ISBN|978-968-6941-67-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuentes stated: "What started this novel was my admiration for Ambrose Bierce and for his ''[[Tales of Soldiers and Civilians]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Rohter, Larry, "From One Civil War to Another". ''New York Times'', Oct. 27, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two adaptations were made of Bierce's story "Eyes of the Panther". One version was developed for [[Shelley Duvall]]'s ''Nightmare Classics'' series and was released in 1990. It runs about 60&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Black|first=Noel|title=The Eyes of the Panther|date=1989-11-26|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099532/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_20|accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shorter version was released in 2007 by director Michael Barton and runs about 23&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Barton|first=Michael|title=The Eyes of the Panther|date=2007-08-10|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1078578/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_8|accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bierce was a major character in a series of mystery books written by [[Oakley Hall]] and published between 1998 and 2006.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/inmemoriam/oakleyhall.html|title=In Memoriam Oakley Hall|publisher=University of California|date=|first=Michelle|last=Latiolais|accessdate=29 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512221941/http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/inmemoriam/oakleyhall.html|archive-date=12 May 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer Richard O'Conner argued that, "War was the making of Bierce as a man and a writer... [he became] truly capable of transferring the bloody, headless bodies and boar-eaten corpses of the battlefield onto paper."{{Sfn | Floyd | 1999 | p = 18}}

Essayist [[Clifton Fadiman]] wrote, "Bierce was never a great writer. He has painful faults of vulgarity and cheapness of imagination. But... his style, for one thing, will preserve him; and the purity of his [[misanthropy]], too, will help to keep him alive."{{Sfn | Floyd | 1999 | p = 18}}

Author Alan Gullette argues that Bierce's war tales may be the best writing on war, outranking his contemporary [[Stephen Crane]] (author of ''[[The Red Badge of Courage]]'') and even [[Ernest Hemingway]].{{Sfn | Floyd | 1999 | p = 18}}

The short film "Ah! Silenciosa" (1999), starring [[Jim Beaver]] as Bierce, weaves elements of "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" into a speculation on Bierce's disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cline-Márquez|first=Marcos|title=Ah! Silenciosa|date=2000-01-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196319/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_67|accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bierce's disappearance and trip to Mexico provide the background for the [[vampire]] [[horror film]] ''[[From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter]]'' (2000), in which Bierce's character plays a central role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Pesce|first=P. J.|title=From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter|date=2000-01-18|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120695/?ref_=nv_sr_4|accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bierce's fate is the subject of [[Gerald Kersh]]'s "The Oxoxoco Bottle" (aka "The Secret of the Bottle"), which appeared in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' on December 7, 1957, and was reprinted in the anthology ''Men Without Bones''. Bierce reappears in the future on [[Mount Shasta]] in [[Robert Heinlein]]'s novella, "[[Lost Legacy]]".

In the fall of 2001, ''An Occurrence Remembered'', a theatrical retelling of Bierce's ''[[An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge]]'' and ''Chickamauga'', premiered off-Broadway in [[New York City]] under the production and direction of [[Lorin Morgan-Richards]] and lead choreographer Nicole Cavaliere.&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War Times Illustrated'', December 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

American composer [[Rodney Waschka II]] composed an opera, ''Saint Ambrose'' (2002), based on Bierce's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.capstonerecords.org/CPS-8708.html | last = Waschka II | first = Rodney | publisher = Capstone Records | title = Saint Ambrose}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, author [[Kurt Vonnegut]] stated that he considered "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" the "greatest American short story" and a work of "flawless... American genius".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Vonnegut | first = Kurt | title = A Man Without a Country | pages = 7–8 | quote = And I consider anybody a twerp who hasn't read the greatest American short story, which is "Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge," by Ambrose Bierce. ...It is a flawless example of American genius...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[The Damned Thing (short story)|The Damned Thing]]" was adapted into a 2006 ''[[Masters of Horror]]'' [[The Damned Thing (film)|episode of the same title]] directed by [[Tobe Hooper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hooper|first=Tobe|title=The Damned Thing|date=2006-10-27|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0805419/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_9|accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Don Swaim writes of Bierce's life and disappearance in ''The Assassination of Ambrose Bierce: A Love Story'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-161498-154-1|title=Fiction book review|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambrose Bierce features as a character in [[Winston Groom]]'s 2016 novel ''El Paso''. In the novel, Bierce is personally executed by Pancho Villa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vitale |first1=Tom |title=Why It Took 'Forrest Gump' Author Nearly 20 Years To Write A New Novel |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/03/496412606/why-it-took-forrest-gump-author-nearly-20-years-to-write-a-new-novel |website=NPR Books |publisher=NPR |accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3637">'''Anastasios Karatasos''' ({{lang-el|Αναστάσιος Καρατάσος}}; 1764 – 21 January 1830) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] military commander during the [[Greek War of Independence]] was born in the village of [[Dovras]] (Δοβράς&lt;!--masc.--&gt; or Δορβρά&lt;!--fem.--&gt;), [[Imathia]] and is considered to be the most important revolutionary from [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]].

==Klephtis and Greek War of Independence==

Karatasos became a [[Klepht]] at the age of eighteen and became quite famous for his actions in the [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] area before he joined the [[Greek War of Independence|Revolution]]. In 1804, with the [[Armatoloi|Armatolos]] [[Vassilios Romfeis]], he defended [[Naousa, Imathia|Naoussa]] from the attacking forces of [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina|Ali Pasha]], but he didn't managed to save the city, that was captured five months later. In March 1821, when [[Emmanouel Pappas]] started the Revolution in [[Chalkidiki]], he collaborated with him trying to spread it through the entire region, but their actions were not well coordinated. Large numbers of Ottoman forces from Thessaloniki were able to defeat the Greek revolutionary forces, and Emmanuel Pappas was retired to [[Mount Athos]]. He returned to [[Naousa, Imathia|Naoussa]] which was liberated from Ottomans on February 19, 1822 under the leadership of [[Zafeirakis Theodosiou]]. 

In April 1822, the Pasha οf Thessaloniki, Abdul Abut with 18,000 men besieged Naoussa, and, fourteen days later, he captured and destroyed the city. Karatasos was responsible for the defence, and he managed to save himself and his family, escaping from the burned town. He continued the Revolution in Macedonia, and, later in 1823, he trapped and destroyed a two thousand men corps of [[Janissaries]] in the Mpampa Bridge at [[Pineios (Thessaly)|Pineios]].

==Descent to South Greece==

Also in 1823 with the Klepht [[Aggelis Gatsos]] and their bands, they crossed Mount Olympus and he collaborated with [[Georgios Karaiskakis]] at [[Agrafa]], and [[Mesologgi]], while he fought at the Battle of Peta and performed guerilla operations in [[Thessaly]].
In his letters to the Revolutionary movement he complained about the lack of supplies for his band, although he fought in numerous battles at [[Nafplio]], Souli, [[Skiathos]], [[Karystos]], Trikeri, [[Messinia]] and performed operations together with [[Markos Botsaris]], [[Giorgakis Olympios]], [[Odysseas Androutsos]], [[Manto Mavrogenous]], [[Andreas Vokos Miaoulis]],
[[Ioannis Kolettis]] and others.
Anastasios Karatasos died at the age of 66 on January 22, 1830 at [[Nafpaktos]] where he was buried with honours.
His statue lies at the central square of [[Veroia]], built by the sculptor Dimitrios Chatzis.

'''Aslaug Haviland''' (January 19, 1913 – January 6, 2003), known as "Utah's Helen Keller" was a deaf and blind Norwegian woman who came to the United States at the age of 16 to attend the [[Perkins School for the Blind|Perkins Institute]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. She became a nationally renowned motivational speaker.

==Biography==
Aslaug Haviland was born in [[Bergen]], Norway, January 19, 1913.&lt;ref name="Aslaug Haviland"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aslaug Haviland|url=http://www.deathfigures.com/index.php?id=Ha-75549964|website=deathfigures.com|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 12 she contracted scarlet fever, and as a result lost both her hearing and vision.&lt;ref name="Jolley Interview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jolley|first1=Clifton|title=A Touch can Reveal Life to Those with Sensory Handicaps|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19850628&amp;id=1JczAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VYQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1410,5754937&amp;hl=en|accessdate=August 12, 2016|work=The Deseret News|issue=June 28, 1985|location=Salt Lake City, Utah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about her early life except that after the loss of her hearing she first attended Norway's school for the deaf, where she learned sign language, and later went on to attend the Royal School for the Blind.&lt;ref name="Daily Herald Bio"&gt;{{cite news|title=Blindness, Loss of Hearing Fails to Daunt Woman in Search of Self-Support|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/25633549/|accessdate=August 12, 2016|work=The Daily Herald|date=25 September 1963|location=Provo, Utah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenberg Lecture"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Joanne|title=My sister's Husband, a German Major, and a Ninety-eight Pound Norwegian|url=http://facultysenate.mines.edu/dist_lecture/greenberg_text.shtml|website=facultysenate.mines.edu|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 16, Haviland's family was able to save up enough money to send her to the Perkins School for the Blind. There was not, however, enough money for anyone to travel with her, so Haviland traveled alone by boat to Boston. She recorded that all of the individuals on the boat, including the captain, looked after her. Even though she was ill for both the journey and most of her time in Boston, Haviland had a great desire to learn English.&lt;ref name="Greenberg Lecture" /&gt; Though Haviland returned to Norway after her studies at the Perkins School for the Blind had finished, she eventually was able to teach herself English.&lt;ref name="Daily Herald Bio" /&gt;

Haviland married and had a son, George. In 1952 she, her husband Arne, and her son immigrated to [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada. Aslaug and her son joined the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in Norway, and in 1958 after the death of her husband, she and George immigrated to the United States and traveled to Utah.&lt;ref name="Daily Herald Bio" /&gt;

Haviland moved to [[Murray, Utah|Murray]], and over time became known as "Utah's [[Helen Keller]]".&lt;ref name="Utah's Helen Keller"&gt;{{cite news|title='Utah's Helen Keller' Talks in Provo Tonight|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/36872466/?terms=Utah%27s%2BHelen%2BKeller|accessdate=August 1, 2016|work=The Sunday Herald|date=3 November 1963|location=Provo, Utah|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haviland was a popular speaker in Utah and the west coast, giving both motivational speeches and training on handicaps and rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="Public Speaker"&gt;{{cite news|title='Helen Keller of Utah' to Speak at Child Haven|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/25635669/?terms=Utah%27s%2BHelen%2BKeller|accessdate=August 1, 2016|work=The Daily Herald|date=2 October 1963|location=Provo, Utah|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haviland spoke to the general public at open meetings, but also to professional and government organizations, including both the Governor's Advisory Council for the Visually Handicapped and the Coordinating Council of Organizations and Agencies Serving the Blind at their 1974 conference at [[Brigham Young University]].&lt;ref name="Speech to Advisory Council"&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet Slated by Agencies Serving the Blind in Utah|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/6573611/?terms=Aslaug%2BHaviland|accessdate=August 1, 2016|work=The Daily Herald|date=12 December 1974|location=Provo, Utah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haviland was also heavily involved in planning and implementing job training programs for the deaf and blind.&lt;ref name="Job Training"&gt;{{cite news|title=Job Training Planned for Blind and Deaf|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/6097744/?terms=Aslaug%2BHaviland|accessdate=August 1, 2016|work=The Daily Herald|date=4 October 1972|location=Provo, Utah|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite her double handicap, Haviland strove for independence and had a strong desire to learn new things. In 1977 she was given a scholarship to attend a nine-week ceramics class at the Salt Lake Art Center school. The class was designed specifically for the blind, and Haviland was named one of the "star pupils".&lt;ref name="Ceramics Class"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ceramics Class Makes a Dream Come True|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/10551789/?terms=Aslaug%2BHaviland|accessdate=August 1, 2016|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=29 May 1977|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haviland's son George would go on to graduate from the University of Utah and serve an [[Mission (LDS Church)|LDS mission]] in [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name="Daily Herald Bio" /&gt; He worked as an admissions counselor at [[BYU]].&lt;ref name="Speech to Advisory Council" /&gt;

Haviland was made an American citizen in 1964.&lt;ref name="Obtains Citizenship"&gt;{{cite news|title=Becomes Citizen Despite Handicap|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/23673443/?terms=aslaug%2Bvaieland|accessdate=August 1, 2016|work=Oshkosh Daily Northwestern|date=9 April 1964|location=Oshkosh, Wisconsin|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Federal Judge [[A. Sherman Christensen]] offered to waive the repetition of the oath of citizenship, Haviland requested to be able to participate in the ceremony.&lt;ref name="Obtains Citizenship" /&gt;  Senator [[Wallace F. Bennett]] reported that it was "one of 1964's most unusual naturalization cases".&lt;ref name="Oath Interpretation"&gt;{{cite news|title=Most Unusual Naturalization Case Mentioned|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/29843427/?terms=aslaug%2Bvaieland|accessdate=August 1, 2016|work=The Ogden Standard-Examiner|date=13 January 1965|location=Ogden, Utah}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An arrangement was made by which as the judge read the oath, a friend of Havilands translated it into sign language and tapped it out into Haviland's palm.&lt;ref name="Oath Interpretation" /&gt;

Haviland died in Utah on January 6, 2003, at the age of 89.&lt;ref name="Aslaug Haviland"/&gt;

'''Carlo Armellini''' (1777–1863) was an Italian politician, activist and jurist. 
He was part of the [[triumvirate]] leading the short-lived [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] in 1849, together with [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Aurelio Saffi]].

Armellini was born in [[Rome]], then part of the [[Papal States]]. A moderate in politics, he followed with interest the apparently progressist moves of the first part of the pontificate of [[Pius IX]]. During [[Anti-Catholic]] protests in 1848, Armellini saved the [[Santo Bambino of Aracoeli]] from arson.&lt;ref name=repubblica&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1994/02/02/rubato-il-bambinello-dell-ara-coeli.html "The Child Dell' Aracoeli Stolen", ''la Repubblica'', February 2, 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the assassination of [[Pellegrino Rossi]] and the exile of the Pope, he became Minister of the Interior. He organized the Constituent assembly and, when the Roman Republic was declared, became (March 1849) member of the leading triumvirate, together with Mazzini and Saffi. He collaborated with [[Antonio Saliceti]] in the writing of the Constitution.

When the Republic was smashed by the French army, he went in exile to Belgium. He died there, in [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]], in 1863.

Armellini was married to the pastellist [[Faustina Bracci Armellini]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pastellists.com/Articles/Bracci.pdf Profile of Faustina Bracci Armellini] at the ''Dictionary of Pastellists Before 1800''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chinese [[Tatars]]''' ({{zh|s=塔塔尔族|t=塔塔爾族|p=Tǎtǎ'ěrzú}}; {{lang-tt|Кытай татарлары|Qıtay tatarları}}) form one of the [[List of Chinese ethnic groups|56 ethnic groups]] officially recognized by the [[China|People's Republic of China]].

Their ancestors are [[Volga Tatars]] tradesmen who settled mostly in [[Xinjiang]] and [[Crimean Tatars]] who suffered from [[Joseph Stalin]]'s expulsion at 1940s.

The number of Chinese Tatars is close to 5000 as of the year 2000, and they live mainly in the cities of [[Yining]],  [[Tacheng]], and [[Ürümqi]]  in Xinjiang.

Chinese Tatars speak an archaic variant of the Tatar language, free from 20th-century loanwords and use the [[Iske imla|Arabic variant of the Tatar alphabet]], which [[Latinisation (USSR)|declined in the USSR]] in the 1930s. Being surrounded by speakers of other Turkic languages, Chinese Tatar partially reverses the Tatar high vowel inversion. They do have a writing system.

Chinese Tatars are [[Sunni Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?peo3=15284&amp;rog3=CH |title=Joshua Project - Tatar of China Ethnic People Profile |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jadid]] schools were founded in Xinjiang for '''Chinese Tatars'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ondřej Klimeš|title=Struggle by the Pen: The Uyghur Discourse of Nation and National Interest, c.1900-1949|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rdcuBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=8 January 2015|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-28809-6|pages=80–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diego Silang y Andaya''' ({{IPA-es|ˈdjeɣo si.ˈlaŋg janˈdaʝa|lang}} : December 16, 1730 – May 28, 1763)  was a Filipino revolutionary leader who conspired with [[United Kingdom|British]] forces to overthrow [[Spain|Spanish]] rule in the northern [[Philippines]] and establish an independent [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]] [[Westphalian state|state]]. His revolt was fueled by grievances stemming from Spanish taxation and abuses, and by his belief in self-government, that the administration and leadership of the [[Roman Catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]] and government in the Ilocos be invested in trained Ilocano officials. He met an [[Itneg people|Itneg]] woman with the name of [[Gabriela Silang|Gabriela Cariño]]. He married her and raised a family in the Ilocos Province.

== Early life ==
Born in [[Aringay]], [[Pangasinan]] (an area in present-day Caba or Aringay, La Union), Silang's mother was [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]]; his father was [[Pangasinan people|Pangasinense]]. Young Diego worked as a messenger for a local Castilian priest in Vigan, Ilocos Sur.  Bright, passionate, and fluent in Spanish, he ferried correspondence from the Ilocos to Manila; journeys that gave him his first glimpse of colonial injustice and that planted the seed of rebellion.

== Revolt ==
Spain allied with France during the [[Seven Years' War]], in opposition to Great Britain. The British in response sought to diminish the Spanish Empire. The seizure of Manila by British naval forces in October 1762, and the subsequent surrender of the Spanish Philippines to Britain during the [[British occupation of Manila|British occupation of the Philippines]], inspired uprisings in the farthest north of Ilocos Norte and Cagayan, where anti-Spanish sentiments festered. Though Silang initially wanted to replace Spanish functionaries in the Ilocos with native-born officials and volunteered to head Ilocano forces against the British, desperate Spanish administrators instead transferred their powers to the Catholic Bishop of Nueva Segovia (Vigan), who rejected Silang's offer. Silang's group attacked the city and imprisoned its priests. He then began an association with the British who appointed him governor of the Ilocos on their behalf and promised him military reinforcement. The British force never materialized.

== Assassination ==
[[File:CabaLaUnionjf709.JPG|200px|thumbnail|right|Memorial of Diego Silang in his birthplace [[Caba, La Union]].]]
Diego Silang was killed by one of his friends, a Spanish-Ilocano mestizo named Miguel Vicos, whom church authorities paid to assassinate Silang with the help of Pedro Becbec.&lt;ref&gt;Lamberto Gabriel, ''Ang Pilipinas: Heograpiya, Kasaysayan, at Pamahalaan''. 1997 {{ISBN|971-621-192-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was 32 years old.

== Legacy ==
{{main article|Gabriela Silang}}

After Silang's death, his Spanish-[[Itneg]] [[Filipino mestizo|mestiza]] wife, Gabriela Silang, took command of the revolt and fought courageously.  The Spanish sent a strong force against her. She was forced to retreat to Abra. Gabriela led her troops towards Vigan but was driven back. She fled again to Abra, where she was captured. Gabriela and her men were summarily hanged on September 20, 1763; she being hanged the last.

== In popular culture ==
* Portrayed by [[Gardo Versoza]] in the 1999 TV Series ''[[Bayani (TV series)|Bayani]]'' in this episode "Diego Silang: Ang Sulat".
* Portrayed by [[JC Tiuseco]] in the 2013 TV series, ''[[Indio (TV series)|Indio]]''.

'''Domenik Hixon''' (born October 8, 1984) is a former [[American football]] [[wide receiver]] and [[return specialist]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He was drafted by the [[Denver Broncos]] in the fourth round of the [[2006 NFL Draft]]. He played [[college football]] at [[Akron Zips football|Akron]]. He was also a member of [[New York Giants]], with whom he became a two-time [[Super Bowl]] winner against the [[New England Patriots]] twice, as well as, a member of the [[Carolina Panthers]] and the [[Chicago Bears]].

==Early years==
Hixon was born to an [[African American]] father and a [[Germany|German]] mother. He attended [[Whitehall-Yearling High School]] in [[Whitehall, Ohio]] and was a [[Letterman (sports)|letterman]] in [[High school football|football]], [[basketball]], [[Track and field|track]], and [[baseball]]. In basketball, he was named Honorable Mention All-State as a [[point guard]]. In track, he cleared 6-5 in the [[high jump]] event.

Hixon was a high school teammate of [[NFL]] [[defensive back]] [[Keiwan Ratliff]].

==College career==
Hixon was one of [[Charlie Frye]]'s passing weapons during his first 3 years at Akron.  In the 2005 MAC Championship game, [[Luke Getsy]] found Hixon for what would be the game winning 36 yard touchdown pass with 11 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, earning Akron its first MAC Championship in school history.

==Professional career==

===Denver Broncos===
Hixon played 4 games for the [[Denver Broncos]] to start the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]] then was released in early October. He functioned as the team's starting kick returner. At the start of the second quarter in the first game of the season against the [[Buffalo Bills]], tight end [[Kevin Everett]] suffered a serious spinal cord injury while tackling Hixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/football/nfl/09/10/bc.fbn.bills.everetthur.ap/index.html?cnn=yes |title=Everett's injury 'catastrophic' |accessdate=2007-09-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070920060906/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/football/nfl/09/10/bc.fbn.bills.everetthur.ap/index.html?cnn=yes |archivedate=September 20, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Everett had a near-full recovery after a grim prognosis but never played another NFL game.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buffalobills.com/news/article-2/Kevin-Everett-five-years-later/5222c099-6845-49bd-ba77-2726fb7ca0d1&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York Giants===
The [[New York Giants]] quickly signed Hixon and soon he took over the main kickoff returning duties. Domenik had one reception for 5 yards against the [[Minnesota Vikings]] on November 25. He made his mark by returning a kickoff 74 yards for a [[touchdown]] in the Giants' 2007 regular season finale against the undefeated [[New England Patriots]].  Hixon's touchdown put the Giants ahead 14-10 in the 2nd quarter, but the Giants lost 38-35.

As the main kickoff returner, Hixon returned 10 kickoffs for an average of 25.3 yards during the Giants' run to [[Super Bowl XLII]]. His returns provided the Giants with good field position and helped propel their offense into the end zone on several occasions. He recovered a critical fumble late in the 4th quarter of the NFC Championship game on January 20 at frigid [[Lambeau Field]], a game the Giants eventually won in overtime. Hixon also recorded 2 special teams tackles in the [[2007 NFL Playoffs|2007 playoffs]].

Hixon later broke out in the Giants second [[preseason]] game against the [[Cleveland Browns]], catching two touchdown passes and then returned an 82-yard kickoff for a touchdown, all in the first quarter.

In week 5 of the [[2008 NFL season|2008 season]], Hixon was forced to start after Giants [[wide receiver]] [[Plaxico Burress]] was suspended for breaking team rules.

Hixon would have 4 catches for 102 yards and a touchdown in his first career start. He left the game late in the first half after suffering a concussion.

In Week 14, Hixon would again be placed in the starting role for the rest of the season, due to the suspension of Burress for conduct detrimental to the team after suffering an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound to his leg.

On June 16, 2010, Hixon suffered a torn ACL at a practice at the Giants' new home in the New Meadowlands, and was pronounced out for the season. He was waived/injured and subsequently placed on the [[injured reserve]] list on July 17.

On August 13, 2011, Hixon returned to the team in the New York Giants and Carolina Panthers preseason game.

On week 2 of the [[2011 NFL season|2011 Season]], Hixon tore his ACL while making a spectacular bobbling catch in the endzone. He was declared out for the season.

In his career, he's made 31 special teams tackles, caught 63 passes for 838 yards (13.3 avg) and 4 touchdowns, ran 3 times on reverse plays for 18 yards, returned 51 punts for 561 yards and a touchdown and 80 kickoffs for 1,966 yards and a touchdown.

On March 3, 2012 Hixon re-signed with the New York Giants.

===Carolina Panthers===
At the start of free agency, Hixon reportedly turned down an offer from the [[Detroit Lions]]. After receiving interest from the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Carolina Panthers]], Hixon ultimately agreed to terms on a one-year deal with the Panthers on April 3, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=NFL.com|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000157088/article/domenik-hixon-carolina-panthers-reportedly-strike-deal|title=Domenik Hixon, Panthers reportedly strike contract|first=Dan|last=Hanzus|date=April 3, 2013|accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a week 16 game against the New Orleans Saints, Hixon caught a game winning 14 yard TD pass from [[Cam Newton]] to give the Panthers a 17-13 win and give them first place in the [[NFC South]].

===Chicago Bears===
On March 13, 2014, Hixon signed a one-year contract with the [[Chicago Bears]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/Bears-add-DE-Young-WR-Hixon/816d48ca-981c-4f95-927d-f7b024786274 Bears add DE Young, WR Hixon]&lt;/ref&gt; On May 27, 2014, during the Organized Team Activities (OTA), he suffered a torn [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] for the third time in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=NFL.com|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000353753/article/chicago-bears-domenik-hixon-suffers-third-torn-acl|title=Chicago Bears' Domenik Hixon suffers third torn ACL|first=Dan|last=Hanzus|date=May 27, 2014|accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement===
On the same day that his injury during the Bears' OTAs was announced, Hixon announced through his [[Facebook]] page that he would be retiring from the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Giants101.com|url=http://www.giants101.com/2014/05/28/ex-giant-domenik-hixon-suffers-third-acl-tear-announces-retirement-from-nfl|title=Ex-Giant Domenik Hixon Suffers Third ACL Tear; Announces Retirement from NFL|date=May 28, 2014|first=Dan|last=Benton|accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=NBCSports.com|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/05/27/domenik-hixon-says-he-has-suffered-another-acl-tear/|title=Domenik Hixon says he has suffered another ACL tear|first=Mike|last=Wilkening|date=May 27, 2014|accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, 2014, the Bears terminated Hixon's contract with an injury settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=ESPN.com|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago-bears/post/_/id/4692549/bears-sign-edwards-spurlock|title=Bears sign Edwards, Spurlock|date=June 3, 2014|first=Michael|last=Wright|accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity work==
Hixon hosts the Next Level Football Camp, with co-founder Anthony Jordan, which provides underprivileged children in the Columbus, Ohio area with a summer football training program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlfcamp.org/next-level-founders.html Next Level Football Camp profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202122839/http://www.nlfcamp.org/next-level-founders.html |date=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, the camp has been staffed by current and former NFL players such as [[Lance Moore]], [[Chase Blackburn]], and [[Gary Joshua]].

'''Elliott Linwood''' (born July 14, 1956) is an [[Americans|American]] conceptual artist known for his large-scale photo grids&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.visualaids.org/artists/detail/elliott-linwood|title=Elliott Linwood|last=AIDS|first=Visual|website=Visual AIDS|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cross-referencing sculptural installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aidsart.org/elliott-linwood|title=The Art of AIDS Prevention|website=The Art of AIDS Prevention|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is based in [[San Diego|San Diego, California]].

== Early life, career and education ==
Linwood was born July 14, 1956 in Lowell and attended Billerica Memorial High School&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/warriorbillerica1974unse|title=1974 Billerica Memorial High School Year Book, pg. 66|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Massachusetts before moving to [[New York City]] when he was nineteen. He came out as a gay man just before the [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] epidemic struck. Testing positive for the HIV virus in the early 1980s led him to a life of activism around this condition. Linwood worked in the field of electronic publishing most of his life. He earned dual Bachelor degrees in sociocultural anthropology and philosophy from [[New York University]] (NYU) in 1982, then attended the [[University of Chicago]] through 1983. He earned dual Masters degrees in Arts and Education from [[San Francisco State University]]’s (SFSU) Interdisciplinary Arts Program in 1993. He attended [[New College School of Law]] in San Francisco through a state-funded HIV empowerment grant,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Law school graduation a first for four New College students|last=Laird|first=Cynthia|date=May 24, 2001|work=San Francisco Bay Area Reporter|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a California attorney in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/220890|title=State Bar of CA :: Elliott   Linwood|last=California|first=The State Bar of|website=members.calbar.ca.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
Linwood was influenced by the work of [[Christine Tamblyn]], a feminist media artist and critic, who was Linwood’s instructor and mentor at SFSU. Tamblyn studied under [[Allan Kaprow]], the originator of [[Happening]]s and Life Art,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-02-14|title=Allan Kaprow|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allan_Kaprow&amp;oldid=765421639|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of California, San Diego|University of California San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-02-17|title=Christine Tamblyn|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christine_Tamblyn&amp;oldid=766041198|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Tamblyn’s tutelage Linwood learned about the performative aspects of Life Art. In a 1991 interview with her Linwood wrote, “In her role as art instructor, Christine Tamblyn teaches that happenings, process-oriented conceptual art, body art, feminist art, persona art, even documentation art . . . can all be considered ‘Life Art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Life Art: Performing Christine Tamblyn|last=Linwood|first=Elliott|date=1991|work=The San Francisco Sentinel|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At NYU Linwood was also introduced to works of anthropologist [[Gregory Bateson]] which analyzed rituals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Naven: A Survey of the Problems Suggested by a Composite Picture of the Culture of a New Guinea Tribe Drawn from Three Points of View|last=Bateson|first=Gregory|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1936|isbn=0-80470520-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; using [[cybernetics]] and [[Systems theory in anthropology|systems theory]] models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution and Epistemology|last=Bateson|first=Gregory|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1976|isbn=0-226-03905-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas, combined with his practical knowledge of computer programming and design of index and list publications, informed his art practice.

Film director [[Blue (1993 film)|Dereck Jarman’s movie ''Blue'']]'','' also influenced work that Linwood presented in “Share Your Vision,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.visualaids.org/projects/detail/share-your-vision|title=Share Your Vision catalog|last=|first=|date=2003|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he won first place and an award. This outreach exhibition was organized to raise awareness about [[Cytomegalovirus retinitis|CMV retinitis]], a preventable condition that causes blindness in people with compromised immune systems. Organized by Visual AIDS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.visualaids.org/|title=Visual AIDS, NY, NY|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche Pharmaceuticals]], the show was presented at [[Artists Space]] in New York City in 2003. An homage to Jarman’s film (consisting entirely of a blue lit movie screen with dialog of the artist visiting doctors about his loss of sight) appears in Linwood’s ''Halos,'' which reads as blurred silhouettes like dark pupils immersed in a field of iris blue light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.visualaids.org/gallery/detail/460|title=Visual AIDS Online Gallery|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching ==
Linwood developed core graduate curricula in Life Art which he taught at SFSU. These seminars explored conceptual and de-materialized art forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972|last=Lippard|first=Lucy|publisher=University of California Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0520210134|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ephemera (printed matter, video, digital communication, etc.) generated around performance spectacles, as documentary records, which might then be commodified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Performance Artist Nao Bustamante's Wake Up Calls|last=Linwood|first=Elliott|date=1994|work=San Francisco Bay Area Reporter|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural criticism ==
Linwood wrote for ''High Performance Magazine'' in Los Angeles, and the ''Bay Area Reporter'', ''The Sentinel'' and ''PhotoMetro'' in San Francisco from 1990 to 1994. Some of the writers and artists Linwood wrote about include [[Christine Tamblyn]], [[Nao Bustamante]], [[Sheree Rose]], [[Millie Wilson]], [[Carrie Mae Weems]], [[Diamanda Galás|Diamanda Gallas]], The Theory Girls, [[Jerome Caja]], Cliff Hengst, [[Paul Monette]], [[Sapphire (author)|Sapphire]], [[Dodie Bellamy]], [[Kevin Killian]], [[Justin Chin]], The Hittite Empire, [[Joe Goode]] and others.

== "Stand Up Theory" ==
Describing the phenomenon of witnessing several prominent Bay Area theorists using body art&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Stand Up Theory|last=Linwood|first=Elliott|date=1990|work=High Performance Magazine|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other types of performance to demonstrate the gaps between subcultural concerns and dominant cultural assumptions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt6779q51c/|title=The Online Archive of California Guide to Christine Tamblyn Papers|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linwood coined the term “Stand Up Theory”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reprogramming the Stage: A Heuristic for Posthuman Performance|last=Gingrich-Philbrook|first=Craig|publisher=Text and Performance Quarterly|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=Vol. 25, Issue 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Writing Performance: Poeticizing the Researcher's Body|last=Pelas|first=Ronald J.|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-8093-2235-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to highlight how these performance artists highjacked the mic to seduce, ambush, and educate their audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Performance Artist Nao Bustamante's Wake Up Calls|last=Linwood|first=Elliott|date=1994|work=San Francisco Bay Area Reporter|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linwood’s sculptural works deploy these strategies. Of ''Initiation,'' a sculpture referencing AIDS and made of honey, Tamblyn wrote, “The piece adroitly expressed the melancholic sensibility that the disease evokes by capitalizing on honey’s association with seduction, entrapment and preservation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Boys Club, Craft Hut, Carnival or Cyberspace?|last=Tamblyn|first=Christine|date=1993|work=High Performance Magazine|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Photo grids &amp; cross-referencing installations ==
[[File:Halos.jpg|thumb|Elliott Linwood's ''Halos,'' part of an exhibition Share Your Vision, 2003]]
Linwood is best known for his large-scale photo grids composed of original and found images culled from the environment, the Internet, cult movies and magazine ads. His cross-referencing installations are similarly made up of found and fabricated objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.visualaids.org/artists/detail/elliott-linwood|title=Visual AIDS, Elliott Linwood (detail)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both bodies of work share similar characteristics, such as a non-linear viewpoint and an indexical relationship between the images and objects presented, which in turn point to things outside their framing device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Elliott Linwood at Morphos|last=Hormel|first=Julie|date=1994|work=Visions Art Quarterly|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sculptures, ''Initiation,'' and ''Resistance,'' and his projection ''Citizen Pan,'' were displayed in ''A Living Testament of the Blood Fairies'' at Artists Space in New York in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artistsspace.org/exhibitions/a-living-testament-of-the-blood-fairies|title=A Living Testament of the Blood Fairies at Artists Space|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an exhibition that Frank Moore curated around text-based work.

== Reception ==
[[File:Swarm_Installation.jpg|thumb|Elliott Linwood, 1993. Left: "Initiation," Right: "Resistance," part of an A Living Testament of the Blood Fairies, 1996]]
Holland Cotter in the April 1997 ''Art in America'' wrote of the exhibition: “The bittersweet tone was set [by] pieces by Elliott Linwood which opened the show. One was a slide projection of words from Sir J.M. Barrie’s ''Peter Pan:'' ‘When the first baby laughed for the first time, the laugh broke into a thousand pieces and spread over the entire world, and that was the beginning of fairies. But all the fairies are dying now because children know such a lot they don’t believe or laugh anymore.’”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/magazine/from-the-archives-art-aids-the-stuff-life-is-made-of/print/|title=Art &amp; AIDS - The Stuff Life is Made Of|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=1997|work=Art in America|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Arning, in the December 10, 1996 ''Village Voice'' also wrote about Linwood’s work in the exhibition, “This synthesis of queer politics, camp humour, dark children’s stories, and magic sets us up for a different kind of AIDS show than New York has seen before.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Days With Artt|last=Arning|first=Bill|date=1996|work=Village Voice|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederick "Fred" Dozier Gardner''' (November 6, 1869{{spaced ndash}}December 18, 1933), an [[United States|American]] businessman and politician from [[St. Louis, Missouri]], served as the [[List of Governors of Missouri|34th Governor]] of [[Missouri]] from 1917 to 1921.

==Political career==
[[File:Fred D. Gardner.jpg|thumb|Frederick D. Gardner in 1916]]
Gardner was born in [[Hickman, Kentucky]]; his father was William H. Gardner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He [http://www.accessgenealogy.com/scripts/data/database.cgi?file=Data&amp;report=SingleArticle&amp;ArticleID=0000412|he rose to prominence] in [[St. Louis]]. The only political office he ever sought was a single term as governor, and he narrowly won [[Missouri gubernatorial election, 1916|the election of 1916]]. However, he did later attend national conventions of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

{{distinguish|George Magheru}}
[[Image:Gheorghe Magheru desen.png|thumb|250px|Gheorghe Magheru]]

General '''Gheorghe Magheru''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈɡe̯orɡe maˈɡeru}}; 1802, [[Albeni|Bârzeiul de Gilort]], [[Gorj County]] &amp;ndash; 23 March 1880) was a [[Romanians|Romanian]] revolutionary and soldier from [[Wallachia]], and political ally of [[Nicolae Bălcescu]].

==A Pandur and radical conspirator==

Magheru began his activities as an [[Oltenia]]n [[hajduk]] in the area around [[Băilești]], and led his group into volunteering for the [[Imperial Russia]]n side in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Russo-Turkish War]] — playing a part in the almost impossible victory of the small Russian vanguard under general [[Friedrich Caspar von Geismar|Geismar]] over the dominating Ottoman forces at the battle of Băileşti 26—27 of September 1828. For his personal contribution, Magheru was decorated with the [[Order of St. Anna|Order of Saint Anne III class]] — and the [[Gold Sword for Bravery|golden sable ″For Bravery″]] to wear it — by the personal edict of [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]].

He was one of the first [[Vladimirescu's Pandurs|Pandurs]] to join the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|Wallachian uprising]] of 1821 under the leadership of [[Tudor Vladimirescu]]. After the latter's assassination and the rebellion's failure, he returned to life as a local [[outlaw]], only to join the Wallachian Army after a few years.

A competent soldier, Magheru went through several ranks in quick succession; at the same time, his past and career made him an important asset for the young radicals, who quickly won him for their side. He joined the [[Freemasonry]]-inspired ''Frăţia'' ("Brotherhood") secret society, founded in 1834 by Bălcescu, [[Christian Tell]], and [[Ion Ghica]], one which aimed to counter the arbitrary rule of [[Alexandru Ghica]], and then plotting against [[Gheorghe Bibescu]].

==Râureni==
After the outbreak of the [[1848 Wallachian Revolution]], Magheru served in the [[Provisional government]] formed by the radicals.

He is noted for organizing the revolutionary and Pandur army camp in Râureni—on the grounds belonging to the [[Schitu Troianu]] Monastery, at the time near [[Râmnicu Vâlcea]] (and now part of the city).

Magheru intended to use the army camp as a base for opposing threats to the Revolution, as early as the summer of that year. However, when the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops swept into [[Bucharest]] in September, he ordered his troops to disband. In this, he probably followed the advice of the United Kingdom [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in the Wallachian capital. The pro-Ottoman attitude remained prevalent among revolutionaries: they had been well received by the Turks, who saw them as a means to oppose the overwhelming Russian influence over the [[Danubian Principalities]], and were probably right in seeing the Turkish move as prompted exclusively by Russian requests (with [[Abd-ul-Mejid I]] careful not to leave the countries opened to the full force of Russian repression, which soon joined the Turkish armies in the occupation). This created the [[paradox]] of Russia enforcing [[Conservatism|conservative]] policies in Wallachia and [[Moldavia]], while most revolutionaries were taking refuge in [[Istanbul]]. Magheru was very likely aware of such nuances, and he probably thought it best not to provoke a violent response.

==Exile==
In exile in Paris (mainly), Magheru was involved in many activities of the Wallachian [[émigré]]s. He expressed his concern that the [[Transylvania]]n [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolution of Romanian Austrian subjects]], aimed at the separatist [[Hungary|Hungarian]] government, was likely to provoke the Romanian fighters under [[Avram Iancu]] to side with a Russian intervention, thus making it impossible for Wallachia to negotiate or fight its way out of the occupation.

He approached the Hungarian leader [[Lajos Kossuth]] in January 1849, with a project that would have replaced the tight [[Centralized government|centralization]] with a [[confederation]] between Hungary and a more Romanian than not Transylvania.

The project was ignored by both sides: the Transylvanian Romanians thought of themselves as loyal subjects of the [[Habsburg]] Crown, and had already suffered waves of violence after [[Józef Bem]]'s armies marched into the region (in the very same project, Magheru asked that Kossuth renounce the politics of [[political repression|repression]] and [[revolutionary terror]]).

==Later life and legacy==

Magheru returned to Wallachia and was active in ''[[Partida Naţională]]'', the movement working for the Union of Moldavia and Wallachia (it was largely composed of former 1848-activists in the two countries). Their political ideal was fulfilled on 24 January 1859, when the already [[List of Moldavian rulers|Prince]] of Moldavia [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] was elected in [[Bucharest]].

One of the main arteries in Bucharest bears Magheru's name (''see [[Bulevardul Magheru]]''), and the campsite in Râureni is now a museum. He is honored on a postage stamp&lt;ref&gt;World Association for the Development of Philately, [http://www.wnsstamps.ch/stamps/RO001.05/en.html Postage stamp featuring Gheorghe Magheru]&lt;/ref&gt; issued by the [[Poşta Română|Romanian Postal Service]].

'''Hubert Looser''' (born 5 April 1938 in [[Vilters-Wangs|Vilters]], [[Switzerland]])&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.altertuemliches.at/biografie/hubert-looser |title=Hubert Looser |publisher=FindART |access-date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a former Swiss [[Businessperson|businessman]], [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]] and [[Private collection|art collector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.museum-folkwang.de/fileadmin/_BE_Gruppe_Folkwang/Dokumente/2016_Pressemitteilungen/Looser/PM_Looser_MuseumFolkwang_Biografie.pdf |title=Biografie Hubert Looser |publisher=Museum Folkwang |access-date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looser was President of Walter Rentsch Holding AG and ELCO Looser Holding AG. Today Looser is active as a member of the board of the Hubert Looser Foundation.

== Life ==
Looser was the sixth born of seven children in 1938 in the Swiss town of Vilters, where he also grew up and attended school. His parents were [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurs]] and had built the company ELCO. After Looser had earned his MBA from [[Columbia University]] [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; he joined his parents company in 1964 and was responsible for the establishment and leadership of the ELCO Group in [[France]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]] until 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/zuercher_kultur/das-kunsthaus-muss-spannender-werden-1.18090779 |title=Das Kunsthaus muss spannender werden |author=Samuel Herzog, Urs Steiner |date=1 June 2013 |publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) |access-date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the founding of Remaco AG for business mediation and the takeover of Walter Rentsch AG in the field of office technology took place. In 1973, Looser took over the management of Walter Rentsch AG with 120 employees, which at his resignation in 1992, consisted of 1,200 employees. 1990/92 Looser resigned as president of the corporate groups Walter Rentsch AG and ELCO Looser Holding AG.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fondation-hubert-looser.ch/Literatur/pdf/Der_Sammler_Lebenslauf.pdf |title=Lebenslauf Hubert Looser |date=1 March 2017 |publisher=Fondation Hubert Looser |access-date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After selling his company shares, Hubert Looser became increasingly involved in the Fondation Hubert Looser, which he co-founded in 1988 and in which he still serves as president and financially supports his fortune with around 40 worldwide [[aid]] projects. Among other things, came the realization of projects for people with disabilities and children in need, as well as training support for young people in countries such as [[Cambodia]], [[Albania]] and [[Romania]] or [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] projects in [[South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

Looser is married with Ursula Looser Stingelin, a father of two children from a previous marriage and lives in Zurich.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

== Art collection ==
During his stay in Paris in 1957 in order to learn the language, posters from an [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] exhibition made a big impression on him and he went to museums around the world whenever he had the time. In his twenties, Looser completed various study trips during his training period to [[Mexico]], [[Japan]], [[Paris]], [[London]] or [[New York (state)|New York]] and laid the foundation of his passion for collecting art. However, his collections first 200 works were mostly Swiss art. Today, Hubert Looser, is considered to be an outstanding private art collector in the Swiss area. His collections main focus is on works of [[surrealism]], [[Abstract expressionism]] and [[minimalism]]. One of [[Willem de Kooning]]'s largest collections outside of the [[United States|US]] is as part of the collection. The museum-suitable works of the collection were introduced in 2008 to the Fondation Hubert Looser, which makes this cultural asset available to the public as a permanent exhibition at the [[Kunsthaus Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blick.ch/life/kunst-kunsthaus-zuerich-erhaelt-74-zeitgenoessische-werke-als-dauerleihgabe-id1854822.html |title=Kunsthaus Zürich erhält 74 zeitgenössische Werke als Dauerleihgabe |publisher=Blick |access-date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Amit and Itzik Kotler presented at DEF CON, demonstrating how a bot master could communicate with [[botnets]] and with "zombie machines" using [[VoIP]] conference calls. Their open-source software, Moshi Moshi, illustrated how they could send instructions to and receive data from botnets and infiltrated networks using any phone line (including payphones).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greene|first1=Tim|title=Defcon: VoIP makes a good platform for controlling botnets|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2180023/uc-voip/defcon--voip-makes-a-good-platform-for-controlling-botnets.html|website=Network World|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greene|first1=Tim|title=10 scariest hacks from Black Hat and Defcon|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2868939/lan-wan/10-scariest-hacks-from-black-hat-and-defcon.html#slide3|website=Network World}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research was also based on his original research into advanced data exfiltration, in which he uncovered a method for side-channel data exfiltration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCSC|url=https://www.ncsc.nl/conference/conference-2011/speakers/iftach-ian-amit.html|website=www.ncsc.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; through various channels - including phone lines and fax machines, and released an open source tool for it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iiamit/data-sound-poc|url=https://github.com/iiamit/data-sound-poc|website=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Ward''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Royal Academy|RA]]}} (23 October 1769 &amp;ndash; 17 November 1859) was a painter, particularly of animals, and an engraver.

==Biography==
[[File:James Ward - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Self portrait, 1830]]
[[File:James Ward - Venus Rising from her Couch - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|James Ward - Venus Rising from her Couch -]]
Born in London, and younger brother of [[William Ward (engraver)|William Ward]] the engraver, James Ward was influenced by many people, but his career is conventionally divided into two periods: until 1803, his single greatest influence was his brother in law [[George Morland]]; from that time, it was [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]. From 1810 or so, Ward started to paint horses within landscapes; slightly later, he turned to very large-scale landscapes, of which ''Gordale Scar'' ([[Tate]], [[London]]), completed in 1814 or 1815 and depicting [[Gordale Scar]] ([[Yorkshire]]) as an example of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], is considered his masterpiece and a masterpiece of [[England|English]] [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[painting]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[File:James Ward - Gordale Scar (A View of Gordale, in the Manor of East Malham in Craven, Yorkshire, the Property of Lord Ribblesdale) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Gordale Scar'']]
Ward devoted much of the period 1815-21 to the painting of a gigantic work titled ''[[Allegory of Waterloo]]'' (now lost); this neither was much praised nor brought in the revenue Ward had hoped for. The experience may have embittered him, and the deaths of his first wife and a daughter were among other tragedies. Like many artists of the time, Ward sought commissions from wealthy gentry of their favorite horses, their favorite hunting dogs or their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C78CAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=%22cock-shooting%22+levett&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X8GDyUdv_z&amp;sig=ZFfopLXl5t2yR1D_f1aXDNYgPFo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LY-PSu-3C4TOsgP3sZwH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cock-shooting%22%20levett&amp;f=false |title=The Sporting Magazine, or Monthly Calendar of the Transactions of The Turf and The Chase and Every Other Diversion Interesting to the Man of Pleasure Enterprise &amp; Spirit, Vol. 19, New Series, Printed for J.

One such family that Ward painted and drew repeatedly, and whom he counted among his friends, were the [[Levett]] family of [[Wychnor Hall|Wynchnor Park]], [[Staffordshire]]. One of Ward's best-known portraits was his ''Theophilus Levett hunting at Wychnor, Staffordshire'' of 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06EFD9103DF933A05754C0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=The New York Times, Grace Glueck, July 30, 2004 |publisher=New York Times |date=2004-07-30 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was Ward's 1811  painting entitled ''The Reverend Thomas Levett and his favourite dogs, cock-shooting''.
Ward also painted a group portrait of three Levett children — John, Theophilus and Frances Levett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4020490 |title=Group Portrait of John, Theophilus and Frances Levett, James Ward, November 1811, Christie's |publisher=Christies.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For the Levetts, see link to the Ward exhibit at the Yale Center for British Art.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=%22theophilus+levett%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=DCbobeeDc2&amp;sig=k4RfM7v3YYOdWwCnqlfXevFthO4&amp;hl=en#PPA232,M1 |title=Animal Painters of England from the Year 1650, Walter Gilbey, 1900 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
&lt;!-- [[File:Ward, James — Horse (painting).jpg|thumbnail|left|File:Ward, James — Horse (painting).jpg]] --&gt;
James was the son of James and Rachael Ward. He was first married to Mary Ann Ward (no known relation) in 1794 and after her death to Charlotte Fritche in 1827 (supposedly a relative of his first wife).
James and Mary Ann Ward had several children including:
#Matilda Louisa Ward, who married the artist John Jackson.
#George Raphael Ward, b. 1798, d. 1879  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/n/i/s/Patrick-T-Nisbett/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0154.html |title=Patrick T Nisbett |publisher=Familytreemaker.genealogy.com |date=1996-08-15 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Ward was the paternal grandfather of the painter [[Henrietta Ward]] and the great-grandfather of [[Leslie Ward]], the ''Vanity Fair'' caricaturist.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1830, Ward moved to [[Cheshunt]] ([[Hertfordshire]]) with his second wife, but he continued to work, particularly on religious themes. A stroke in 1855 ended his work, and he died in poverty. He is buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=Paths&gt;{{cite book|title=Paths of Glory|date=1997|publisher=Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery|page=103|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:The_Deer_Stealer_by_James_Ward.jpeg|thumb|left|The Deer Stealer]]
James Ward was one of the outstanding artists of the day, his singular style and great skill set him above most of his contemporaries, markedly influencing the growth of British art. Regarded as one of the great animal painters of his time, James produced history paintings, portraits, landscapes and genre. He started off as an engraver, trained by William, who later engraved much of his work. The partnership of William and James Ward produced the best that English art had to offer, their great technical skill and artistry having led to images that reflect the grace and charm of the era. He was admitted for membership into the [[Royal Academy]] in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/30/arts/art-review-dashing-world-of-animals-as-regal-as-their-owners.html?pagewanted=all |title=Art Review: Dashing World of Animals as Regal as Their Owners, Grace Glueck, The New York Times, July 30, 2004 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2004-07-30 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Ward's best-known paintings,''The Deer Stealer'', was commissioned in 1823 for the sum of 500 guineas by Ward's patron Theophilus Levett. When the work was finished, Levett pronounced himself delighted with the results, and consequently raised the remuneration to 600 guineas. Subsequently, Ward was said to have been offered 1,000 guineas for the painting by 'a nobleman,' which he declined. The painting now hangs at [[Tate]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=159447975 A Great British Collection, sothebys.com]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has released three solo albums.

==Early life==
James grew up in the [[Highlands–Douglass, Louisville|Highlands–Douglass]] neighborhood of [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. He attended St. Martha grade school and graduated from [[St. Xavier High School (Louisville)|St. Xavier High School]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.louisville.com/content/21-questions-my-morning-jackets-jim-james-music | publisher=Louisville.com | title=21 Questions with My Morning Jacket's Jim James| author= Lou | date= 25 October 2010 | accessdate= 8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; James briefly attended the [[University of Kentucky]].

==Career==
[[File:New Multitudes at Webster Hall.jpg|alt=New Multitudes onstage bathed in red stage lights|thumb|James playing bass guitar as Yim Yames with the ''[[New Multitudes]]'' band]]
Prior to forming My Morning Jacket, James was the vocalist and guitarist of Month of Sundays, currently known as Mont de Sundua.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

As the vocalist, [[frontman]], [[Record production|producer]] and lead songwriter for My Morning Jacket, James has been instrumental in defining the sound of the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/mymorningjacket/z?q=Z%20My%20Morning |title=Z Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic |publisher=Metacritic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given an "Esky" for best songwriter in [[Esquire (magazine)|''Esquire'']]'s 2006 Esky Music Awards in the April issue.

James typically plays [[rhythm guitar]], [[acoustic guitar]], and occasional [[lead guitar]] on My Morning Jacket songs. He played the role of the band leader in the [[Bob Dylan]] biopic ''[[I'm Not There]]'', singing the song "Going to Acapulco", with [[Calexico (band)|Calexico]] as his backing band, which was featured on the soundtrack of the film. [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|''Rolling Stone'']] listed James among their "20 New Guitar Gods" along with fellow My Morning Jacket guitarist [[Carl Broemel]]. In 2008, James, along with former My Morning Jacket guitarist and cousin Johnny Quaid, formed Removador Recordings and Solutions record label. The label, as described on its website, functions "on the simple principal of yielding the highest annual percentage of aural joy back into the hearts and minds of investors and shareholders with ease and convenience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://removador.com/about-removador/ |title=About Removador |publisher=Removador Recordings and Solutions |date= |accessdate=2011-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715173617/http://removador.com/about-removador/ |archivedate=July 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed vocals on [[The Decemberists]]' 2009 album ''[[The Hazards of Love]]''.

On April 4, 2009, James performed at the [[Radio City Music Hall]], New York City, in the "Change Begins Within" concert benefitting the [[David Lynch Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim James &amp; Bettye Lavette added to David Lynch Foundation show|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2009/03/jim_james_betty.html|website=Brooklyn Vegan|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 2009, James released ''[[Tribute To]]'', an EP covering [[George Harrison]] songs. A portion of the proceeds from the album were donated to the [[Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary]]. The EP was available on yimyames.com as both a digital download and a physical CD/LP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nme.com/news/my-morning-jacket/45589 |title=My Morning Jacket man to release George Harrison covers EP |work=[[NME]] |date= |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, James and the rest of My Morning Jacket played themselves in "[[My Morning Straitjacket]]", an episode of the animated television series ''[[American Dad!]]''

In 2012, [[Rounder Records]] released the [[Woody Guthrie]] tribute album ''[[New Multitudes]]'' which features songs [[cover songs|covered]] by a variety of musicians including James (as Yim Yames) and [[Jay Farrar]]. James wrote an article on My Morning Jacket,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.louisville.com/content/my-morning-jacket-my-morning-jacket-jim-james-music |title=My Morning Jacket by My Morning Jacket: Jim James |work=Louisville|date= |accessdate= 2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; discussing how the band got its name and growing up in Louisville, for the July 2012 issue of ''[[Louisville (magazine)|Louisville]]'' magazine. Bandmates [[Patrick Hallahan]] and [[Tom Blankenship]] also wrote articles for the issue.

James released his debut solo full-length album, ''[[Regions of Light and Sound of God]]'', on [[ATO Records]] on February 5, 2013.

In early 2014 James recorded for ''[[Lost on the River: The New Basement Tapes]]'' alongside Elvis Costello, Marcus Mumford, Taylor Goldsmith and Rhiannon Giddens. The album was produced by T-Bone Burnett and is a compilation of partial songs written by Bob Dylan that were never released.

On November 5, 2015, the [[David Lynch Foundation]] organised another benefit concert at New York City's [[Carnegie Hall]] named "Change Begins Within" to promote [[transcendental meditation]] for stress control. Jim James participated with [[Katy Perry]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Angelique Kidjo]], and classical guitarist [[Sharon Isbin]]. And since each of the performers actively practices [[transcendental meditation]], they also spoke to its power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Grow  |first= Kory |date= |title= Katy Perry, Sting Stun at David Lynch's Meditation Benefit Concert - Jerry Seinfeld, Angelique Kidjo, Jim James and others also perform and explain relaxation technique's importance to them at New York's Carnegie Hall |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/katy-perry-sting-stun-at-david-lynchs-meditation-benefit-concert-20151105 |newspaper= Rolling Stone Magazine |location= |archive-url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/katy-perry-sting-stun-at-david-lynchs-meditation-benefit-concert-20151105 |archive-date=November 5, 2015  |access-date= November 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

James plays himself and sings in episodes 4 and 10 of the Showtime series ''[[Roadies (TV series)|Roadies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sho.com/video/50000/roadies-on-set-with-jim-james |title=Roadies: Roadies: On Set with Jim James &amp;#124; SHOWTIME |publisher=Sho.com |date=2016-07-07 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016 he released his second solo album ''Eternally Even''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22570-eternally-even/|title=Jim James: Eternally Even Album Review|last=Leas|first=Ryan|date=November 7, 2016|website=pitchfork.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 17, 2018, James announced the June 29 release of his third solo album of original material, ''[[Uniform Distortion]]''. Along with the announcement was the release of a single and music video for the album's opening track ‘Just A Fool’. Also, included with the announcement was a letter James wrote to photographer [[Duane Michals]] requesting use of his photograph ‘The Illuminated Man’ for the album's cover art. James discovered the photo in the 1971 publication ''[[Whole Earth Catalog|The Last Whole Earth Catalog]]'', which he stated was a primary inspiration for the new album.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2018/04/17/603048490/jim-james-decries-blanket-distortion-in-society-with-new-song-album|title=Jim James Decries Media Distortion In Society With New Song, Album|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan de Dios Cañedo''' (born in [[Guadalajara]], 18 January 1786; died in [[Mexico City]], 28 March 1850) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] statesman.

==Biography==
He received a good education and was admitted to the bar in 1809. He was elected a deputy to the [[Cortes Generales|Spanish Cortés]] in 1813, and soon became prominent as a parliamentary orator. While in [[Madrid]], he published a manifesto to the Spanish nation in defence of the colonial interests, which was eagerly read both in [[Spain]] and her American possessions.{{sfn|Wilson &amp; Fiske|1900}}

On his return to Mexico in 1824, Cañedo took part in the debate relative to the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|new republican constitution]]. He was several times deputy and senator, [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|minister of foreign affairs]] under [[Guadalupe Victoria|Victoria]]'s administration, represented his country as plenipotentiary in [[Brazil]], [[Peru]], and [[Chile]], and was in charge of the foreign office and the [[Secretary of the Interior (Mexico)|department of the interior]] under [[Anastasio Bustamante|Bustamante]]. Afterward he went to [[Europe]], where he resided for some years, and had just returned to Mexico when he was killed by an unknown assassin.{{sfn|Wilson &amp; Fiske|1900}}

'''Lai Châu''' ({{audio|Lai_Châu.ogg|listen|help=no}}) is a [[Provinces of Vietnam|province]] in the [[Northwest (Vietnam)|Northwest]] region of [[Vietnam]]. Lai Châu Province is the most sparsely populated in Vietnam, and it shares a border with China. It was once a semi-independent [[Tai Dón people|White Tai]] confederation known as [[Sip Song Chau Tai]], but was absorbed by France into French Indochina in the 1880s and subsequently became part of Vietnam following Vietnamese independence in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David: ''Vietnam Past and Present: The North'' (History and culture of Hanoi and Tonkin). Chiang Mai. Cognoscenti Books, 2012. ASIN: B006DCCM9Q.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zum.de/whkmla/histatlas/seasia/haxlaos.html&lt;/ref&gt; It became part of the [[Northwest Autonomous Area]] of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] from 1955 to 1975, when Lai Châu Province was formed. [[Điện Biên Province]] was carved out of Lai Châu in 2004.

== Etymology ==
''Sip Song Chau Tai'' is a [[Tai Lü language|Tai Lü]] compound consisting of ''sibsong'' "twelve" and ''chu'' "master". It is [[cognate]] to {{lang-t|สิบสองจุไท}}, and may rendered in English as "Twelve Tai Kingdoms" or "Chiefdoms", according to relative standing in the [[mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Southeast Asian mandala political model]], in allusion to either a [[Chief of the Name]] or a [[tribal chief]]. ''Sibsong'' derives from Chinese [[wikt:十|十]] (ten) and [[wikt:雙|雙]] (pair). "Chu", (rendered in Tai as จุ or in longer form [[wikt:เจ้า|เจ้า]],) derives from [[Middle Chinese]] 主 (ćǘ) "master."

== Administrative divisions ==

== Economy ==
[[File:Laichaubridge.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A bridge in Lai Châu Province]]
Lai Châu has long been the poorest province in Vietnam. It is also the least industrialised province. In 1974, the industrial output of [[Hanoi]] - the richest province in North Vietnam at that time - was 47 times as high as that of Lai Châu.&lt;ref&gt;Beresford, Melanie (2003): "Economic Transition, Uneven Development, and the Impact of Reform on Regional Inequality", in Luong, Hy V. (ed.): ''Postwar Vietnam: dynamics of a transforming society''. Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield&lt;/ref&gt;  The province became even more backward after the more industrialised south was separated to become [[Điện Biên Province]]. In 2007, Hanoi's industrial output (before its merger with [[Hà Tây Province]]) was 93 times that of Lai Châu.&lt;ref name="GSO09"&gt;General Statistics Office (2009): ''Socio-economical Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities''. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial output has, however, grown rapidly in recent years, more than tripling between 2000 and 2007, making the fastest growing sector in the province compared to an agriculture and forestry sector that has grown by less than 50% and a service sector that has more than doubled in the same time.&lt;ref name="GSO09"/&gt;  Industrial products include liquor, bricks, cement and electricity. Industrial output in 2007 was 476.6 billion [[Vietnamese đồng]]s, accounting for 28.9% of the province's economy, compared to only 16.5% in 2000.

Lai Châu's main agricultural products (in 2007) are rice (99,900t), maize (35,000t), [[cassava]] (48,900t) and tea (16,532t). The production of rice and maize tripled since 2000, while the output of cassava and tea has been increasing by around 40% and 120%.&lt;ref name="GSO09"/&gt; Tea from Lai Châu is sold to other provinces in Vietnam and also exported to other countries.

Lai Châu has a relatively large forestry sector with an output of 176.3 billion đồngs in 2007. It has, however, been far overtaken by the agricultural, industrial and service sectors and contributed little to recent growth. It has grown by only 1.66% in 2007 and 1.69% in 2006, after declining by almost 19% between 2000 and 2005.&lt;ref name="GSO09"/&gt;

There are plans to exploit [[rare-earth element]]s in Lai Châu.
[[Vietnam]]'s central government signed an agreement in October 2010 to supply Japan with [[rare-earth elements]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11661330| title=Rare earths supply deal between Japan and Vietnam| work=[[BBC News]]| date=31 October 2010| accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Lai Châu Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2010/10/2010103191334878158.html| title=Vietnam signs major nuclear pacts | publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] | date=  31 October 2010 | accessdate= 31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of Japan's efforts to diversify its supply of rare earths and decrease its dependence on imports from China.

Lai Châu's economy grew by 14.56% in 2007, 12.3% in 2006 and 50.75% between 2000 and 2005.&lt;ref name="GSO09"/&gt;

== Infrastructure ==
[[File:Lai Châu Province road construction.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Road construction works in Lai Châu province]]
=== Transport ===
National Road 4 connects Lai Châu to [[Lào Cai Province]], National Road 12 to [[Điện Biên Province]] and National Road 32 to [[Yên Bái Province]]. There is also a road to [[Gejiu]] in China. There is neither an airport nor a railway in the province.

Road transport has grown rapidly in recent years. Freight traffic increased from 1 million tons.km in 2000 to 21.3 tons.km in 2007, while passenger traffic increased from 4.4 to 16.7 million passenger km.&lt;ref name="GSO09"/&gt;

Road infrastructure is still not very developed. Only 19.36% of the roads in the province are paved and only 10.53% of respondents to a survey of local businesses think that road quality is good or very good.&lt;ref name="PCI09"&gt;[http://pcivietnam.org/province_profile_detail.php?province=54  Vietnam Provincial Competitiveness Index 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telecommunication ===
As of 2007, there 22,100 telephone subscribers in Lai Châu, a significant increase from the 14,200 in the previous year.&lt;ref name="GSO09"/&gt; Only 35.59% of the respondents to a survey assessed telecommunications quality as good or very good, the lowest value among all the provinces in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="PCI09"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3765">'''Lamour Desrances''' (also spelled '''L'Amour Desrances''', '''Lamour Derance''', and '''Lamour Dérance''') was a [[Haitian Revolution|Haitian revolutionary]] leader. A former [[Maroon (people)|maroon]], he was born in [[Africa]] and brought to [[Saint-Domingue]] as a [[slave]]. During the revolution, when local figures often gained power in control of small armed forces, Desrances became a local military leader in the mountains surrounding [[Port-au-Prince]] and [[Saint-Marc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Études sur l'histoire d'Haïti, suivies de la vie du général J.M. Borgella|author1=Beaubrun Ardouin |author2=Jérôme Maximilien Borgella|year=1853|language=French|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[War of Knives]], Desrances was loyal to [[André Rigaud]] in his battle with [[Toussaint Louverture]], and was one of the few black officers in the predominantly [[mulatto]] northern Rigaud-loyal army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution|author=Laurent Dubois|year=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press|ISBN=0-674-01826-5|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Rigaud's defeat by Louverture, Desrances is referred to as a rebel in Louverture's autobiography. [[Céligny Ardouin]] argues that Louverture and [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] saw Desrances as a growing rival due to his power in the region, and determined to defeat him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=COMMENT SE CONCERTA LUTTE POUR L'INDÉPENDANCE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g-P2PZ5FXUcC&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;ots=Felkt2M3Vf&amp;dq=Lamour+Desrances&amp;pg=PA28&amp;ci=227,324,567,113|author=Céligny Ardouin|author-link=Céligny Ardouin|page=30|language=French}} in {{cite book|title=Auteurs haïtiens: Morceaux choisis|author=Solon Ménos|author-link=Solon Ménos|author2=Dantès Bellegarde|author2-link=Dantès Bellegarde|author3=Georges Sylvain|author3-link=Georges Sylvain|year=1904|publisher=Impr. de Mme F.

Two months later, the French forces arrived under [[Charles Leclerc]] and during L'Ouverture's open conflict with the French, Desrances notably changed his loyalty to the French under General [[Pampile de Lacroix]] to fight against Dessalines' forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution|author=Laurent Dubois|year=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press|ISBN=0-674-01826-5|pages=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; An enemy of L'Ouverture in both instances, L'Ouverture wrote of him: "L’Amour Desrances, who had caused all the inhabitants of the Plain of Cul-de-Sac to be assassinated; who urged the laborers to revolt; who pillaged all this part of the island."&lt;ref&gt;L'Ouverture also records that Leclerc raised Desrances to the rank of brigade commander.{{cite book|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/beard63/beard63.html|pages=308–309|title=Toussaint L'Ouverture: A Biography and Autobiography|translator=Beard, J.

[[Canada's Walk of Fame]], located in [[Toronto]], Ontario, is a walk of fame that acknowledges the achievements and accomplishments of successful Canadians. It consists of a series of stars imbedded in 13 designated blocks worth of sidewalks in Toronto, located in front of [[Roy Thomson Hall]], the [[Princess of Wales Theatre]], and the [[Royal Alexandra Theatre]] on [[King Street, Toronto|King]] and Simcoe streets. The first group of members was inducted in 1998, and it has since expanded to include the RBC Emerging Artist Music Mentorship Prize competition, which assists emerging Canadian musicians with getting their careers off the ground. 

The Walk of Fame was first conceived in 1996 when Peter Soumalias suggested the idea of a Walk of Fame for famous Torontonians to the board of the Toronto Entertainment District Association. They rejected his idea but he went on to establish a Walk of Fame for Canadians.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/thewalk/history.xml.htm|title=History|author=Peter Soumalias|accessdate=2009-04-27|publisher=Canada's Walk of Fame|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204073131/http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/thewalk/history.xml.htm|archivedate=February 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's Walk of Fame runs an annual contest in which Canadians can nominate potential inductees. In 2000, prior to the introduction of the online voting system, over 30,000 nominations were received via letters, fax and e-mail.&lt;ref name="Record2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Walk on the 'famous' side; New pathway-to-the-stars entries include William Shatner and Gordie Howe|date=March 22, 2000|page=E07|publisher=''[[The Record (Waterloo Region)|The Record]]''|author=Andrew Flynn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee then analyzes the nominees based on the following criteria: the nominee was born in Canada or has spent their formative or creative years in Canada; they have had a minimum of 10 years experience in their field; they have had a national or international impact on Canada’s Cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/aboutus.xml.htm|title=About Us|date=January 29, 2007|accessdate=2009-04-27|publisher=Canada's Walk of Fame|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604015048/http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/aboutus.xml.htm|archivedate=June 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Selection Committee's evaluation, the nominees that meet all of the requirements are forwarded to the board of directors, who then select the inductees.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

New inductees are inducted annually at an unveiling ceremony where their star, a stylized [[maple leaf]], is revealed.&lt;ref name="Record2"/&gt; The first was held in 1998 and only four of the twelve then-living inductees attended: [[Karen Kain]], [[Norman Jewison]], [[Barbara Ann Scott]] and [[Rich Little]].&lt;ref name="Record"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sidewalk constellation; Walter Ostanek, Leslie Nielsen in group joining Canada's Walk of Fame|date=June 2, 2001|publisher=''[[The Record (Waterloo Region)|The Record]]''|author=John McKay}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, the Walk of Fame also hands out the [[Cineplex Entertainment|Cineplex]] Legends Award, which is posthumously awarded "to Canadian pioneers in film, music, sport, arts, and innovation."&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/June2008/03/c7813.html|title=Canada's Walk of Fame Cements Another Legendary Group of Canadians into the Sidewalks of Toronto|publisher=CNW Group|date=June 3, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/entertainment/story.html?id=4371a73f-30bc-4193-819f-21cf3e9d32c4 |title=Albertans to take Canada's Walk of Fame |author=Canwest News Service |date=June 4, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher=''[[Calgary Herald]]'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605104718/http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/entertainment/story.html?id=4371a73f-30bc-4193-819f-21cf3e9d32c4 |archivedate=5 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the Allan Slaight Award was introduced, which recognizes the achievements of young Canadians who have the ability to turn their talent into inspiration. The award is presented annually to a young Canadian who is making a positive impact in the field of music, film, literature, visual or performing arts, sports, innovation or philanthropy. The list of recipients of the Allan Slaight Award include: [[Nikki Yanofsky]] in 2010, [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] in 2011, [[Melanie Fiona]] in 2012, [[Carly Rae Jepsen]] in 2013, [[The Weeknd]] in 2014 and [[Shawn Mendes]] in 2015.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Of the 168 stars on the walk of fame, 154 are for individuals, including [[sportsperson|athlete]]s; coaches; actors, directors, writers and producers of movies, television and stage; singers, songwriters and musicians; playwrights; [[authors]]; comedians; [[cartoonists]]; and supermodels. Fourteen stars have been given to groups, such as music bands, comedy troupes, sports teams. In these cases, the group name is listed on the star and the names of individual members are omitted.&lt;ref name="OSite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com|title=Canada's Walk of Fame|publisher=Canada's Walk of Fame|accessdate=2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Martha''' (died 551) was the mother of [[Simeon Stylites the Younger]]. She is [[veneration|venerated]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] on [[July 4 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|July 4]].

When her parents betrothed her to a young man, she seriously considered leaving home and withdrawing from the world. However, [[John the Baptist]] is said to have appeared to her and advised her to do as her parents had arranged and marry the man to whom they had betrothed her. Simeon Stylites was the child of this marriage.

She is said to have risen at midnight for prayer every night. She regularly helped those in need, visited the poor and orphans, and attended to the sick.

In the year before her death, she is said to have seen a number of [[angel]]s with candles in their hands and to have learned the time of her upcoming death from them. The vision prompted her to even greater dedication to prayer and good works.

She died in 551 AD, and was buried near her son.

There have been many reports of her appearing to various people since her death, generally to heal the sick and offer instruction to people. The most noted of these was to an abbot of the [[Monastery of Simeon Stylites the Younger|monastery founded by her son]]. The abbot placed a [[votive candle]] on her grave with the instruction that the light never be allowed to be extinguished. Martha appeared to him saying that when the abbot burned a light on her grave, he was asking her to pray to the Lord for him.

==Etymology==
“Masagana” is a Filipino term for “bountiful”&lt;ref name=“Bettina”/&gt; while 99 refers to the number of sacks of rice yielded per hectare of land in every harvest season.&lt;ref name="return"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nilles|first1=Giovanni|title=Return of FM’s Masagana 99, Biyayang Dagat eyed|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/10/24/1636806/return-fms-masagana-99-biyayang-dagat-eyed|accessdate=28 September 2017|work=The Philippine Star|date=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Promoted by Marcos as a way to for the Philippines to achieve [[rice]] [[Self-sufficiency economy|self-sufficiency]], the program achieved initial success by encouraging farmers to plant new [[IR8|“Miracle Rice” (IR8)]] variety of rice which the [[International Rice Research Institute]] had been developing since 1962, during the administration of President [[Carlos P. Garcia]].&lt;ref name=“BillGanzel”&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe50s/crops_17.html |title=The Development of “Miracle Rice” Varieties |last=Ganzel |first=Bill |date=2007 |website=Wessels Living History Farm |publisher=Ganzel Group |access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was launched at the time the country was experiencing a shortage of supply on rice and was credited for the launching of the Philippine [[Green Revolution]] in 1973 which allowed the country to export rice to other Asian countries.&lt;ref name="return"/&gt;

However, the program eventually failed because its credit subsidy component proved unsustainable.&lt;ref name=“1980”&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=XB8310418 |title=Some notes on the Masagana 99 [rice] program and small farmer access to credit [Philippines] |last=Economics) |first=Esguerra, E.F.

==Proposed revival==
[[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Rodrigo Duterte]] expressed his interest to revive the program on October 2016.&lt;ref name="return"/&gt; The plan met opposition from MASIPAG, a group of farmers and scientist, saying that revival of the program will bring back issues such as debt, replacement of traditional varieties with newer ones, and the promotion of pesticide use which they say will harm animals, farmers and crops and insisted that only large firms benefited from the program. The [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]] notes that the old variety used in the Masagana 99 program is already phaseout and the Masagana 99 can use newer varieties of rice and insists that environmentally friendly pesticides will be promoted under the potentially revived Masagana 99.&lt;ref name=“Bettina”/&gt;

'''Musso''' (1897, in Kediri, East Java – Madiun, in 31 October 1948) was one of PKI leaders and one of figures in Madiun affair.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Musso was born Munawar Musso in 1897, Pagu, Kediri.{{sfn|Swift|2010|p=91}}{{sfn|McVey|2006|p=169}}{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=2}} His father was a bank clerk in Wates, Mas Martoredjo.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=2}}

In Batavia, Musso studied at teacher school. He met Alimin, disciple of G.A.J. Hazeu and D. van Hinloopen Labberton.{{sfn|McVey|2006|p=169}} According to [[Soemarsono]], one of PKI leaders in Madiun affair, Musso continued to Hogere Burger School in 1913.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=8}} Musso stayed at [[Tjokroaminoto]]'s boarding house with [[Alimin]] and [[Sukarno]].{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|pp=8, 10}} According to Arnold C. Brackman, at the time Musso worked as cashier at Surabaya post office.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=9}} In Surabaya, Musso also met [[Henk Sneevliet]].{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=10}}

===Beginning of PKI career===
Musso and Alimin had more important task in infiltrating [[Sarekat Islam]] than [[Surjopranoto]]. They were members of both [[Communist Party of Indonesia|PKI]] and SI before they were arrested due to Afdeling B affair.{{sfn|McVey|2006|p=168}} Musso involved in farmer revolt in Cimareme, Garut supported by Sarekat Islam Afdeling B.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|pp=10-11}} In the trial, while Alimin confessed the false statement he made to help Tjokroaminoto, Musso didn't do the confession. In the prison, Dutch government handled him poorly. [[Agus Salim]] complained to Voolksraad for this treatment. According to McVey, Musso held a grudge to Dutch government after this treatment. After Musso and Alimin were released in 1923,{{sfn|Triyana|2011|p=137}} the former was offered to teach Indonesian language with English as language of instruction in Japan by van Hinloopen Labberton.{{sfn|McVey|2006|p=169}} However Japanese government rejected Musso reasoning he didn't have sufficient academic diploma, though McVey assumed the main reasons were his experience in prison and his political view.{{sfn|McVey|2006|pp=169-170}} Musso then reorganize Batavia PKI branch and led the new one.{{sfn|McVey|2006|p=170}}

In January 1925, committee of Indies National Congress conducted a meeting resulting the neutral, Surabaya-based association Indonesian Study Club. There was presence of Musso at the club first convention in February supporting the club agenda and wishing it to be closer to grassroots.{{sfn|McVey|2006|p=283}} Also in early 1925, Musso and Alimin gave speech in a rally organized by VTSP in Banten increasing communism influence there.{{sfn|McVey|2006|p=303}} After the failure of machinists' strike on 5 October, Musso concluded that the strike was too early than expected.{{sfn|McVey|2006|p=310}}

In December 1925, PKI leaders planned to rebel to the Dutch Indies government. The government knew this and arrested most of the leaders in January 1926. Musso was one of who managed to escape.{{sfn|Ricklefs|2001|p=225}} He along with Budisutjitro and Sugono fled to Singapore meeting PKI agent Subakat and Alimin who previously staying with [[Tan Malaka]] in Manila.{{sfn|McVey|2006|p=316}} The five plus Sardjono, Mohammad Sanusi, and Winanta discussed for three days concluding the execution of revolt middle of the year. The meeting also resulted sending Alimin to Manila to request Tan Malaka to support the idea which was rejected.{{sfn|McVey|2006|p=316}}{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=13}} In February, another meeting was held but Alimin didn't mention the rejection by Tan Malaka.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|pp=17-18}}

===Comintern member===
Some times in March 1926, Musso and Alimin went to Moscow via Canton to ask for support from [[Comintern]] for a revolt.{{sfn|Swift|2010|p=92}}{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=18}} Knowing the plan from meeting in Singapore remained to be implemented, Tan Malaka arrived in Singapore in June to prevent Musso and Alimin, but he was too late because both of them had already gone to Russia.{{sfn|McVey|2006|p=321}}{{sfn|McLane|2015|p=92}}{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=19}} The plan was if Comintern supported, they instructed PKI in Dutch Indies to refrain of the revolt until aid stuff arrived there then PKI launched full revolt, else if Comintern didn't support, PKI launched guerrilla and terror attacks.{{sfn|McVey|2006|p=321}} Comintern rejected the request reasoned that Dutch Indies government was still too solid. To prevent the revolt idea brought up by Musso and Alimin, Comintern instructed them to stay in Moscow longer studying the Trotskyist deviation.{{sfn|Swift|2010|p=92}} However, in October Musso still managed to instruct his people in Dutch Indies to do revolt.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=20}}

In 1927, Musso and Alimin went to Russia and studied at Lenin school for several years.{{sfn|McVey|2006|p=202}}

In July 1928, Musso under the name Manavar along with Alimin, Semaoen, Darsono, and Tadjudin attended the Sixth Congress of Comintern led by Stalin. He expressed his opinion about the failure of the revolt in Jawa and Sumatra the year before.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=30}} After the congress, Musso served as member of executive committee of Comintern. Musso also continued his study at Lenin University in Moscow but he didn't finish it.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=31}}

Musso married a Russian woman in 1929 and became father of two children.{{sfn|Swift|2010|p=92}}{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=31}}

In April 1935, Musso went to Surabaya meeting Siti Larang Djojopanatas, wife of Musso's old friend Sosrokardono to request residence for several months.{{sfn|Dhyatmmika|2011|pp=32–33}} Musso was sent there to consolidate the old PKI that crushed in 1927.{{sfn|Swift|2010|p=92}} Musso explained Dimitrov line, a new Communist tactical approach, in several newspaper, including three times in''Indonesia Berdjoeang''.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=34}} Focusing in Surabaya and Solo, in this consolidation, Musso managed to persuade Pamudji, Azis, Sukajat, Djoko Soedjono, [[Amir Sjarifudin]], and [[Tan Ling Djie]] to join PKI.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|pp=34-35}} Musso instructed the new members to infiltrate and join the nationalist organizations. The Dutch Indies government discovered this and exiled the members to [[Boven Digul]]. However Musso went back to Moscow before the government arrested and exiled him.{{sfn|Swift|2010|p=92}}

Article written in ''Bintang Merah'' stated that Musso went to Prague in early November 1947 helping Soeripno that represented Indonesia to discuss consular agreement with USSR. However, Soeripno himself claimed that Musso went there in March 1948.{{sfn|Swift|2010|p=93}} In January 1948 after the signing of [[Renville Agreement]], Musso defended his comrades in Indonesia from criticism by Moscow, especially Amir Sjarifudin, stating that it was "just a tactic, in order not to draw attention of anti-communist faction."{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|pp=38-39}} After the talks in Prague finished on the third week of May that concluded the establishment of diplomatic relations between USSR and Indonesia,{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=40}} Musso, under the name Soeparto, and Soeripno returned to Indonesia on 21 June 1948. They dropped in New Delhi and stayed for half a month or three weeks waiting Indonesian Air Force finished the transaction of aircraft. They join the flight of a newly bought aircraft to Indonesia, stopped by in Thailand then stayed in Bukittinggi for eight days.{{sfn|Swift|2010|p=93}}

Musso planned a Communist revolution idea, consistent with Soviet policy, named ''A New Road for the Indonesian Republic'' whether in Prague or on the way home.{{sfn|Swift|2010|p=94}} During in Prague, Musso discussed with Soeripno and Paul de Groot, a Dutch communist, about Netherlands-Indonesia relation whether Indonesia became Netherlands' commonwealth or fully independent.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=42}} The plan, according to Ann Swift, was doubtlessly instructed by Moscow, though Musso himself denied this.{{sfn|Swift|2010|pp=101, 108}} According former Armed Force Chief of Staff Himawan Soetanto, the idea was influenced by "Zhdanov line". The idea was named New Road because it was different from old PKI which was influenced by Dimitrov line.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=43}}

Musso and Soeripno landed in a swamp in Tulungagung on 10 August.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=37}} After picked up, they moved to Solo to meet the military governor Wikana.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=38}} They arrived in Yogyakarta on 11 August 1948.{{sfn|Ricklefs|2001|p=280}}{{sfn|Swift|2010|pp=91, 94}} On 12 August, ''Merdeka'', a newspaper based in Solo, wrote that "there was a possibility that Musso the veteran leader that was very popular had returned".{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=41}} Later on 13 August, he met Sukarno to discuss about revolution.{{sfn|Swift|2010|pp=91, 94}} During a meeting of Politbiro PKI on 13–14 August, Musso presented the New Road. He criticized the Indonesian revolution as bourgeois revolution, not proletariat. He also demanded more labor representatives in government and armed force.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=44}} Musso also criticized PKI movement while he was not there: use of funds from van der Plas 25000 gulden by Amir Sjarifudin to fight [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]], the resignation of Amir as prime minister without consulting to the party, leader of illegal PKI didn't hasten the formation of legal party after independence, and complexity of the communist organizations which divided into PKI, [[Pesindo]], and [[SOBSI]].{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|pp=45-46}}

Musso then through Politbiro announced to merge PKI that had a poor leadership with Pesindo and SOBSI which was under Front Demokrasi Rakyat on 21 August and turned PKI as a mass based party, though the idea of merger was rejected by Asrarudin and SK Trimurti.{{sfn|Swift|2010|p=108}}{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=44}}{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|pp=50-51}} Other cadres that refused to merge under PKI were from Pesindo and [[Barisan Tani Indonesia]] which was inclined to [[Sjahrir]] and from [[Murba Party|Murba]] and [[Acoma Party|Angkatan Komunis Muda]] (Akoma) which was inclined to Tan Malaka. The merger was officially conducted on 27 August.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=51}}

On 28 August, Musso discussed with [[Ibnu Parna]] from Gerakan Revolusi Rakjat (GRR) and Akoma leaders for a possibility both organizations merged with PKI. However, after PKI published its reorganization on 31 August, GRR criticized Musso and PKI.{{sfn|Swift|2010|pp=113–114}}

In early September, leftist parties were merged to PKI. After the reorganization, the new Politbiro was created on 1 September. The new members were younger and more amenable of Musso's idea including [[D.N. Aidit]], [[M.H. Lukman]], [[Njoto]], and [[Sudisman]].{{sfn|Ricklefs|2001|p=280}}

To publicize PKI's new course and gain more support, Musso conducted speeches and mass meetings. On 3 September Musso met Barisan Tani Indonesia, while on the 5th Musso met with students. Started on 7 September, Musso, Wikana, Setiadjit, and Amir Sjarifudin attended mass meetings in Central and East Java, beginning in Solo, Madiun the day after, Kediri on the 11th, Jombang and Bojonegoro on the 13th and 14th, and Cepu and Purwodadi on the 16th and 17th.{{sfn|Swift|2010|p=106}}

===Madiun affair and death===
In the middle of the month, an incident between PKI influenced armed force and government loyalist armed force occurred in Solo.{{sfn|Ricklefs|2001|p=280}} After this incident, according to ''Bintang Merah'', on 16 September in Cepu, Musso ordered his men in Solo to prevent the incident to spread.{{sfn|Swift|2010|p=121}} On 18 September, the [[Madiun Affair|crossfire broke up in Madiun]]. PKI sympathizer stated that the new government called National Front was formed after killing government loyalist officers and taking strategic places over. Hearing this, Musso, Amir, and the others went to Madiun to control the rebellion.{{sfn|Ricklefs|2001|p=280}} According to the PKI-influenced militia leader Soemarsono, his action was approved by Musso when Soemarsono visited Musso and Amir two days before. However, according to Ann Swift and Himawan Soetanto, Musso didn't know about this.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|pp=77, 95}}

On the evening of 19 September, Sukarno ordered his people to choose himself and Hatta over Musso. According to [[M.C. Ricklefs]], Musso had no experience in Indonesia so he had no power over majority of Indonesian people compared to Sukarno, even local militias that influenced by anti-government side didn't support Musso.{{sfn|Ricklefs|2001|p=281}} Responding this, Musso formed Front Nasional Daerah Madiun, appointed Soemarsono as military governor and Djoko Soedjono as militia commander. Hatta was dissatisfied with the response, and stated that Musso wanted to take over the government and "establish Soviet government."{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=98}}

The rebels were pushed after Siliwangi Division was ordered to attack PKI force in Madiun.{{sfn|Ricklefs|2001|p=281}} Musso and Amir knew that they couldn't resist Subroto-led attack instructed PKI force to escaped to and hid in hills.{{sfn|Swift|2010|p=130}} On 28 September, Musso, Amir, and Soemarsono left Madiun to Ngebel and Dungus, Ponorogo.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|pp=99, 103}} When in Balong, Ponorogo, Musso and Amir had a disagreement. Musso wanted to move to south while Amir preferred north.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=104}}

On 31 October, in mountain in Ponorogo, Musso was killed by government force in an assault while trying to escape.{{sfn|Ricklefs|2001|p=281}}{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=105}}

==Political view and legacy==
Musso was a Stalinist that thought there can only be one party for the proletarian.{{sfn|Ricklefs|2001|p=280}} After returning from Moscow, Musso created idea ''Jalan Baru untuk Republik Indonesia'' (''The New Road for Indonesian Republik'') which changed the direction of PKI from Dimitrov to Zhdanov.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=43}} The next PKI leader after Madiun affair, Alimin, disagreed the idea and offered the idea that PKI as little party but has militant cadres throughout Indonesia. However, young cadres in Alimin era such as Njoto, Aidit, and M.H. Lukman were influenced by Musso.{{sfn|Dhyatmika|2011|p=117}}

Sukarno described Musso as "jago", a rooster pet for fighting because when Sukarno and Musso lived together in Tjokroaminoto's house, Musso "liked to fight".{{sfn|Swift|2010|p=94}} Ruth T. McVey paired Musso with Alimin as the leaders of revival of PKI in 1920s. [[Soe Hok Gie]] described Musso similar to Haji Misbach who "liked to run amok" and rather reckless.{{sfn|Triyana|2011|p=135}}{{portal|Indonesia}}

Musso Statue will be built in a park in [[Phnom Penh]] as a tribute to Musso who visited Phnom Penh in 1931.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

'''Natalia Rybczynski''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[paleobiology|paleobiologist]], [[professor]] and [[researcher]].

She is a research scientist with the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]] and holds a professorship at [[Carleton University]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]. Her doctorate was obtained at [[Duke University]] and her main interests are evolutionary functional morphology, particularly at the polar climes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natalia Rybczynski at the Canadian Museum of Nature|url=http://nature.ca/puijila/pr_tm_e.cfm#nr|website=Canadian Museum of Nature|accessdate=14 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021170045/http://nature.ca/puijila/pr_tm_e.cfm#nr|archivedate=21 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rybczynski is notable for having discovered a previously unknown carnivorous arctic mammal, a proto-seal, which represents a [[transitional fossil|"missing link"]] between land-dwelling mammals and modern day ocean-going seals. ''[[Puijila darwini]]'' was discovered in 2007 on [[Devon Island]] in the Canadian arctic. Discovery of this specimen was announced in the journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] in April 2009. She has also contributed to the understanding of the biomechanics of ''[[Suminia]]'', a primitive mammal thought to exhibit early evidence of teeth and jaw structure specialized for chewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rybczynski|url=http://www1.carleton.ca/biology/people/natalia-rybczynski|website=Carleton University|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her discovery of a fossil [[tibia]] of a [[High Arctic camel]] was featured in a November 2015 [[TED talk]] given by [[Radiolab]] producer Latif Nasser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=You have no idea where camels really come from|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/latif_nasser_you_have_no_idea_where_camels_really_come_from|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is the niece of writer and architect [[Witold Rybczynski]].

'''Peter Joseph Bis''' (c. 1951 - August 16, 2012) was a [[homeless]] man in [[Washington, D.C.]], known by the [[Capitol Hill]] community for his social personality and keen, savant-like memory.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Steve Hendrix  |author2=J. Freedom du Lac  |lastauthoramp=yes |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/capitol-hill-grieves-for-homeless-man-who-was-neighborhood-fixture/2012/08/21/1395b668-ebc8-11e1-b811-09036bcb182b_story.html |title=Capitol Hill grieves for homeless man who was neighborhood fixture |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2011-07-18 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His usual daytime location was the corner of Second Street and Massachusetts Avenue Northeast, sitting on a crate under a tree outside an [[Exxon]] station by [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]]. According to his brother, James Bis, Bis suffered from [[schizophrenia]]. He would greet and converse with passers-by, often offering repetitive, random advice such as “No skinny dipping!” or pointing out the number of days until the weekend. He never drank alcohol or used drugs, but did use cigarettes and drink coffee. He took pride in his neighborhood, spent his days saying hello to the regulars who passed him on the sidewalk, and was provided with food and clothes by the local community. He was even given an apartment at one point, but was eventually evicted because his [[hoarding]] tendencies filled up his residence.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt; He would usually sleep in the garage of the Exxon station, and the Exxon workers would let him use a computer in the office.

==Early life==
Little is known about Bis’s childhood or pre-college years. He grew up in [[Kalamazoo]] near [[Western Michigan University]], the son of two teachers. According to his younger brother James, Peter Bis attended Monsignor John R. Hackett High School graduating class of 1969, graduated from [[Western Michigan University]] in 1974 with a [[bachelor’s degree]] in [[history]]. He went to [[Thomas M. Cooley Law School]] in [[Lansing, Michigan]] for a year, then worked as a hotel night clerk, then started a car-painting company. He was unable to stick with these plans, however, and eventually started wandering the country as a result of his developing schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;

==Schizophrenia==
James Bis reported that the illness appeared in Peter Bis’s adult years, as the latter frequently started wearing a lead-lined baseball cap with red lights. The schizophrenia was eventually diagnosed, and his family petitioned that he be committed for treatment, but after only a few months of in-patient treatment, Bis began wandering the country. Though he was never known to have purposefully [[Hitchhiking|hitchhiked]], he would accept rides from drivers. James Bis described his brother as “a harmless kind of schizophrenic” who avoided getting help for his illness.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;
 
Bis’s schizophrenia often made it difficult for listeners to figure out what was accurate in his stories of his past. He claimed that he had received the equivalent of five or six [[doctorates]], that he had studied in the [[Holy See|Vatican]], that he had been married and divorced, and that he once had a job as a [[cab driver]] in [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="blogspot2006"&gt;{{cite web|author=Marc |url=http://theworldaccordingtomarc.blogspot.com/2006/05/peter-joseph-bis.html |title=The World According To Marc: Peter Joseph Bis |publisher=Theworldaccordingtomarc.blogspot.com |date=2006-05-11 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most of his claims were ungrounded, these claims endeared Bis to the community, since they could never fully figure out his true background.

==Profound memory==
The people of the local community frequently knew him for his keen memory. After his death, personal [[blogs]] and D.C. newspapers alike produced articles in memory of him, specifically mentioning his uncanny memory. Washington, D.C. journalist and professor, Terry Mattingly, an Orthodox Christian, referenced a conversation with Bis in which Bis wished him a happy Easter. After Mattingly had gone a few steps, Bis stopped him and recalled that [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] Easter was not until a week later. “He was right, of course. Had I shared that personal detail with him or did he glean that tidbit of liturgical minutia from one of the newspapers he read, day after day? Anyone who knew him could describe similar mysterious encounters,” wrote Mattingly in his column for [[Scripps Howard News Service]].&lt;ref name="tmatt1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Monday, October 1st, 2012 &lt;!-- by tmatt --&gt; |url=http://www.tmatt.net/2012/10/01/a-soulful-voice-on-a-capitol-hill-sidewalk/ |title=Blog Archive » Soulful voice on a Capitol Hill sidewalk |publisher=tmatt.net |date=2012-10-01 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
Besides his sharp memory, Bis was known by the community for his [[conspiracy theories]], which he delved into on his [[personal blog]], which according to the title, focused on “[[Holy See|Vatican]], [[Finances]], [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]], [[Kalamazoo]].” The blog was written in [[third-person narrative|third person]] and was one long post, which Bis added to routinely. The blog may have actually been written for him by another person, according to one source,&lt;ref name="blogspot2006"/&gt; but the identity of the person is unknown, apart from a theory that the blog’s dictation “to a friend” may have been the blog’s scribe. Bis reportedly believed he was an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]], and was especially known for his claim that he was [[Princess Diana|Princess Diana’s]] ex-lover, and that the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] was responsible for her death. He preferred not to refer to himself as homeless, preferring the term “[[political refugee]].”

==Effect on the D.C. community==
Numerous [[bloggers]] and [[Capitol Hill]] voices have referenced him as being extremely influential on the local community. After a period of time living by the [[United Nations]] building in New York City, Bis moved to Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. He stationed himself outside the Exxon station next to [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] in D.C., particularly under the tree in front of the station. He usually sat on a crate under the tree, where he would greet passers-by every day. He would use the restrooms at the Exxon station, and help to keep it clean; he would only sleep inside the garage on especially cold nights—other than that, he insisted on sleeping outside.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;

Since he usually kept his belongings under his tree, the D.C. local city government once threatened to remove his belongings. Betsy Woodruff of [[National Review Online]] reports that 24 of his acquaintances—including lobbyists and hill staffers—signed a petition against the removal of his possessions. Woodruff herself was acquainted with Bis from her time as an intern for the [[Heritage Foundation]], which was right next to Bis’s Exxon station. She said that upon introducing a friend of hers to Bis one day, he proceeded to take them into the Exxon to watch [[YouTube]] videos, smoke, and weep over the death of his [[ex-girlfriend]] Princess Diana. “So he probably didn’t date Lady Di,” wrote Woodruff. “But I’ve never heard anyone talk about a significant other with as much passion and kindness as Pete.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/314207/memoriam-peter-bis-betsy-woodruff |title=In Memoriam: Peter Bis - By Betsy Woodruff - The Corner - National Review Online |publisher=Nationalreview.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2006 post from The World According to Marc blog reported meeting Bis while Bis happened to be sitting on a bench near [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] and three [[United States Senate]] buildings. The blogger, Marc, included a picture of Bis and shared the story of how Bis would never ask for money, but seemed particularly interested in the people he would meet. The blogger also mentioned that Bis had given him a business card and told him to follow his own—Bis’s—blog, which featured a lengthy, convoluted path of far-reaching [[conspiracy theories]]. Marc said that after initially meeting, he would make a point to walk to work early so that he could sit and chat with Bis for a bit.&lt;ref name="blogspot2006"/&gt;

Similarly, Josie of TellMeAStoryJosie blog reported having had a number of personal interactions with Bis. She reported his common “Three more days ‘til the weekend!” greeting, and his just as common, unrelated “No skinny dipping!” advice. “Pete was as much a part of the landscape of our life here on the Hill as the Capitol dome in the distance,” she wrote in her post about him, following the news of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tellmeastoryjosie.wordpress.com/2012/08/16/pete-or-thoughts-on-home/ |title=Pete, or Thoughts on Home « tell me a story |publisher=Tellmeastoryjosie.wordpress.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bis was a popular individual for many D.C. interns, including the interns for [[Talk Radio News]], two of whom performed an interview with him in 2008. This also included interns from the [[Washington Journalism Center]], one of whom blogged about him on the program’s blog, also in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Welcome |first=Rose |url=http://thewashingtonjournalismcenter.com/?p=5027 |title=Goodbye to a Hill icon » The Washington Journalism Center Blog |publisher=Thewashingtonjournalismcenter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
His death on August 16, 2012 was initially reported by the Running For 28 Years blog by bloggers from the local D.C. area. The blogger reported that he awoke to flashing blue and red lights around 1:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. outside his apartment window, not far from the Exxon station. After walking over to the station, the blogger asked a police officer who confirmed that Bis had been found dead inside the Exxon garage from an apparent [[heart attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.runningfor28years.com/journal/2012/8/16/rip-peter-biz.html |title=Squarespace - Account Not Available |publisher=Runningfor28years.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was later cremated and sent to his brother, James Bis.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;

A neighborhood Catholic church, St. Joseph’s on Capitol Hill, held a memorial [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] for him several weeks later. [[Terry Mattingly]] reported that a painting of Bis, titled, “A Contemplation of Justice,” was placed near the entrance of the church. The homilist, Deacon Gary Bockweg, said that over the years many people had suggested opportunities for Bis to get off the streets and into an actual job, including Bockweg’s own suggestion to work as a [[Wal-Mart]] greeter. However, Bockweg said that Bis had turned down the offer, saying he was over-qualified to work as a [[Walmart greeter|Wal-Mart greeter]]. Additionally, Bockweg shared information that when he had first seen Bis many years ago, Bis had been in St. Joseph’s and was well-dressed but quiet. As time passed, Bis began to arrive with less propriety, and even began bringing a wheelchair of what could only have been his personal effects. He also grew more talkative, which drew Bockweg to get to know him better.

“The last thing people do today when talking to a stranger is call them by name,” said Bockweg. “That’s how Pete connected. … He called us by name and that slowed us down. That made Pete real to us.”&lt;ref name="tmatt1"/&gt;

'''Roelof Frederik "Pik" Botha''', {{post-nominals|country=ZAR|DMS}} (27 April 1932 – 12 October 2018) was a South African politician who served as the country's [[foreign minister]] in the last years of the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid era]].&lt;ref name="TL20181012"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2018-10-12-apartheid-era-foreign-affairs-minister-pik-botha-has-died/ | title=Apartheid-era foreign affairs minister Pik Botha has died | publisher=TimesLive | accessdate=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered a liberal – at least in comparison to others in the ruling [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] and among the [[Afrikaner]] community – but the bulk of his career was spent defending South Africa's apartheid system of [[racial segregation]] against foreign criticism.

Botha was nicknamed 'Pik' (short for ''pikkewyn'', [[Afrikaans]] for 'penguin') because of a perceived likeness to a [[penguin]] in his stance, accentuated when he wore a suit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/7th-april-1984/9/a-smart-penguin A smart penguin], [[Geoffrey Wheatcroft]], ''[[The Spectator]]'', 7 April 1984, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was not related to Prime Minister (later President) [[P. W. Botha]], under whom he served as foreign minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Funteriano |first1=Andre |title=Explainer: Are you confusing Pik Botha with PW Botha?

==Early life==
Botha was born at [[Rustenburg]] in the [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]].&lt;ref Name=GuardianObit&gt;{{cite news |last1=Van der Vat |first1=Dan |title=Pik Botha obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/12/pik-botha-obituary-south-africa |accessdate=13 October 2018 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At the age of four, he was struck by [[meningitis]] in [[Lourenço Marques]] (modern-day Maputo, Mozambique); he received treatment at a small hospital in [[Barberton, Mpumalanga|Barberton]], Transvaal, and his mother vowed that if he survived, he would become a church minister.&lt;ref name=ja&gt;[http://janiallan.com/2014/01/24/pik-botha-poetry-waves-politspeak/ Pik Botha – waves of politspeak] janiallan.com. 24 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Botha attended Paul Kruger Primary School where his father was principal. He excelled in high school, becoming chairman of the debating society, captain of the first rugby team and officer in the school cadets.&lt;ref name=ja/&gt;  Botha was also a keen writer of both prose and poetry in [[Afrikaans]], and his writing supplemented his salary in his early years as a diplomat.&lt;ref name="GuardianObit" /&gt; In his first year studying law at the [[University of Pretoria]], a [[theologian]] explained to him that God would not expect him to keep his mother's promise to become a church minister.&lt;ref name=ja/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/12/pik-botha-obituary-south-africa|title=Pik Botha obituary|last=Vat|first=Dan van der|date=2018-10-12|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diplomat and lawyer ==

Botha began his career in the South African foreign service in 1953, serving in [[Sweden]] and [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name="GuardianObit" /&gt; From 1963 to 1966, he served on the team representing South Africa at the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[The Hague]] in the matter of ''[[Ethiopia]] and [[Liberia]] v. South Africa'', over the South African occupation of [[South-West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]).&lt;ref Name=GuardianObit /&gt;

In 1966, Botha was appointed legal adviser at the Department of Foreign Affairs, in which capacity he served on the delegation representing South Africa at the [[United Nations]] from 1967 to 1977.&lt;ref Name=GuardianObit /&gt; In 1974, he was appointed [[South African Permanent Representative to the United Nations|South Africa's permanent representative to the United Nations]]&lt;ref Name=GuardianObit /&gt; and presented his credentials to [[UNSG|Secretary-General]] [[Kurt Waldheim]] on 15 October 1974;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Permanent Representative of South Africa Presents Credentials |url=https://www.unmultimedia.org/s/photo/detail/246/0246098.html |website=United Nations Photo |accessdate=14 October 2018 |date=15 October 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; in November of that year, however, South Africa was suspended from membership of the [[UNGA|General Assembly]] and, over the ensuing years, the country was excluded from official participation in virtually all of the UN's organs and agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=United Nations: History and Present Status |url=http://www.dirco.gov.za/foreign/Multilateral/inter/un.htm |publisher=Department of International Relations and Cooperation, Republic of South Africa |accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politician ==

In the elections of [[South African general election, 1970|1970]] and [[South African general election, 1974|1974]], Botha was elected to the [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]] as [[Parliament of South Africa|MP]] for [[Wonderboom, Pretoria|Wonderboom]] in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]]. In 1975, he was appointed South Africa's Ambassador to the United States, in addition to his UN post. [[South African general election, 1977|In 1977]], he re-entered Parliament as MP for [[Westdene, South Africa|Westdene]], and was appointed [[Minister for Foreign Affairs]] by [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]] [[Balthazar Johannes Vorster|B. J. Vorster]]. He continued to represent Westdene for the remainder of his political career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Donaldson |first1=Andrew |title=Pik Botha: A good man working for a bad government |url=https://www.news24.com/Obituaries/pik-botha-a-good-man-working-for-a-bad-government-20181012 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |publisher=news24.com |date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botha entered the contest to be the leader of the National Party in 1978. He was allegedly considered Vorster's favourite and received superior public support among whites (''We want Pik!'') but withdrew after criticism concerning his young age, lack of experience (having spent 16 months as foreign minister) and alleged liberal beliefs as opposed to the ultra-conservative NP machinery (in which he lacked a significant position), instead throwing his support behind [[Pieter Willem Botha|P. W. Botha]], who was ultimately elected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919860,00.html SOUTH AFRICA: The Not-So-Favorite Choice], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', October 9, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Pik Botha helped to draft a speech that would have announced common decision-making on all levels in a single constitutional unit and a formula for bringing about the release of [[Nelson Mandela]], but this draft was rejected by P. W. Botha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicsweb.co.za/news-and-analysis/the-rubicon-revisited The Rubicon revisited], Hermann Giliomee, Politicsweb, 20 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

The next year, he stated publicly (during a press conference in Parliament, asked by German journalist Thomas Knemeyer) that it would be possible for South Africa to be ruled by a black president provided that there were guarantees for [[minority rights]], but was quickly forced to acknowledge that this position did not reflect government policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/apartheid-still-spits-in-face-of-anc-1486293 Apartheid still spits in face of ANC], ''[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]]'', 14 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Botha recalled in 2011 that he had been "severely reprimanded and almost fired" over his remarks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/lifestyle/2011-08-07-what-ive-learnt-pik-botha/|title=FROM THE ARCHIVES {{!}} What I've learnt: Pik Botha|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1988 Pik Botha was instrumental in lengthy peace talks between South Africa, [[Cuba]], and the [[People's Republic of Angola]] aimed at ending the [[South African Border War]]. In December of that year Botha and Defence Minister [[Magnus Malan]] ratified the [[Brazzaville Protocol]], which led to the effective cessation of hostilities in that conflict.&lt;ref name="WashPost"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1988/12/14/cuba-angola-south-africa-sign-accord/3269b973-4180-4c23-972b-179674f9e09b/ Cuba, Angola, South Africa Sign Accord], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', December 14, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Namibian independence ===

On 22 December 1988, Pik Botha signed the [[New York Accords|tripartite agreement]] involving [[Angola]], [[Cuba]] and South Africa at [[United Nations headquarters]] in New York City which led to the implementation of [[List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 401 to 500|Security Council Resolution 435]], and to South Africa's granting of independence to [[Namibia]].&lt;ref name="WashPost"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 1988, Botha, with a 22-strong South African delegation from [[Johannesburg]], was initially booked to travel to the Namibian independence ratification ceremony in New York on [[Pan Am Flight 103]] from London. Instead, the booking was cancelled as he and six delegates took an earlier flight, thereby avoiding the fatal PA103 bombing over [[Lockerbie]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/6060436/Lockerbie-and-the-conspiracy-theories.html Lockerbie and the conspiracy theories], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 20 Aug 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===National unity===
Botha subsequently served as Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs in South Africa's first post-apartheid government from 1994 to 1996 under President [[Nelson Mandela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mtshali |first1=Samkelo |title=News of #PikBotha's death draws mixed reaction in political arena |url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/news-of-pikbothas-death-draws-mixed-reaction-in-political-arena-17462142 |website=iol.ca.za |accessdate=14 October 2018|date=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Botha had first met Mandela in May 1990 at the historic [[Groote Schuur Minute]], and was highly impressed by Mandela's knowledge of [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]] history.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Botha became deputy leader of the National Party in the Transvaal from 1987 to 1996. He retired from politics in 1996 when [[Frederik Willem de Klerk|F. W. de Klerk]] withdrew the National Party from the government of national unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=South Africa shaken by sudden resignation of De Klerk's party |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/south-africa-shaken-by-sudden-resignation-of-de-klerk-s-party-1.47572 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]'' |date=10 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Madisa |first1=Kgothatso |title=Pik Botha one of 'leading personalities in SA politics' – De Klerk |url=https://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/south-africa/2018-10-12-pik-botha-one-of-leading-personalities-in-sa-politics-de-klerk/ |accessdate=14 October 2018 |publisher=Sowetan Live |date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2000, Botha declared his support for [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Thabo Mbeki]]. Botha expressed criticism for the government's [[affirmative action]] policies saying that the South African government of 1994 would never have reached a constitutional settlement with the ANC had it insisted on its current affirmative action programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fin24.com/Economy/ANC-broke-AA-agreement-says-Pik-Botha-20130815 ANC broke AA agreement, says Pik Botha], [[News24|Fin24]], August 16 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an interview on affirmative action, Botha publicly declared that he had never been a member of the ANC, and would not join under its current policies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131023055631/http://www.beeld.com/nuus/2013-08-16-regstel-aksie-tref-swartes-ergste Regstel-aksie ‘tref swartes ergste’], ''[[Beeld]]'', 16 August 2013 (in [[Afrikaans]])&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 December 2013, Botha appeared on the BBC's ''[[Question Time (TV programme)|Question Time]]'', hosted in [[Johannesburg]], discussing the life and legacy of [[Nelson Mandela]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/nelson-mandela/10514293/BBC-Question-Time-in-South-Africa-Whos-Who.html BBC Question Time in South Africa: Who's Who], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 12 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Poet-diplomats''' are poets who have also served their countries as [[diplomats]].

==Overview==
Abhay Kumar wrote, "There seems to be a connection between poetry and diplomacy as several diplomats over the ages have excelled in poetry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Poetry and Diplomacy |author=Abhay Kumar |website=[[The University of Iowa]] |date=December 19, 2016 |url=https://iwp.uiowa.edu/silkroutes/city/new-delhi/text/poetry-and-diplomacy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further adds, "Diplomacy is a complex art that involves the mixing of political acumen, cultural finesse, language abilities and conversation skills to wield the power of persuasion. Diplomacy is generally conducted in short sentences which reveal as much as much they hide. Poetry is no different".&lt;ref name="Abhay Kumar"/&gt; He adds that poetry and diplomacy share a few attributes such as ambiguity and brevity in expressions, a detached handling of the subject matter among others.

Aldo Matteucci wrote, "Many diplomats have used poetry in their diplomatic work: wrapping words in silk is the diplomat’s job. A diplomat may turn a lie into a ‘constructive ambiguity’ – which is a way of defining poetry.  Some poets have been diplomats – Neruda, Claudel, St. John Perse. It’s an occupational hazard: the stimulating place, the sheltered existence – and the ability to paraphrase the unknowable. Few diplomats will admit to using poetry as a survival strategy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Poetry: A Survival Strategy for Diplomats|author=Aldo Matteucci |newspaper=Reflections on Diplomacy |date=November 2, 2007 |url=http://deepdip.wordpress.com/2007/11/02/poetry-a-survival-strategy-for-diplomats/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kamel S. Abu Jaber wrote,"The language of diplomacy, often like poetry, has the ability to move people from mood to mood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Language and diplomacy|author=Kamel S. Abu Jaber |newspaper=DiploFoundation |year= 2001|url=http://www.diplomacy.edu/resources/general/language-and-diplomacy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stefano Baldi and Pasquale Baldocci wrote in their book ''Through the Diplomatic Looking Glass'',"The publication of poetry by diplomats seems more inspired by an inner need to express oneself freely than the wish to share sensations and feelings developed during the career. Only verses with their detachment from reality can present an escape from cold and bureaucratic style often imposed by the profession".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Poetry and Theatre|author=Stefano Baldi and Pasquale Baldocci|newspaper= Through the Diplomatic Looking Glass (page 57)Paperback, 176 pages {{ISBN|978-99932-53-18-1}} |year= 2007|url=http://issuu.com/minam/docs/through_the_diplomatic_looking_glass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil bestowed the rank of Ambassador posthumously to its poet-diplomat [[Vinicius de Moraes]] recognizing his poetic talent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90782/90873/7107465.html Brazil bestows posthumous rank on poet, diplomat Vinicius de Moraes] The People's Daily August 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian diplomats have a curious obsession with poetry. “Poets and diplomats use the same building blocks: the idea and the word,” said Vladimir Kazimirov&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russian-diplomats-have-a-curious-obsession-with-poetry/2016/04/01/c0c26d4e-f688-11e5-958d-d038dac6e718_story.html Russian diplomats have a curious obsession with poetry] The Washington Post, 2 April 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;

“Poetry and diplomacy both rely on the alchemy of paradox. We mix fear and hope, power and weakness, love and hate to find a way out of the impossible,” said Dominique de Villepin, French Foreign Minister and a published poet in July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobalist.com/diplomacy-the-art-of-the-impossible/ Diplomacy — The Art of the Impossible? ] The Globalist, 31 December, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Portia Clark''' (born 11 July 1990) is a Zambian R&amp;B and pop singer, songwriter, and philanthropist.

==Biography==
Portia was born in [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]] in 1990. Her father was a member of a [[South Africa]]n anti-apartheid movement and was killed under unclear circumstances when she was one years old.

In 2014, she released her debut single "Hope" which she co wrote with Zambian renowned Gospel artist Mutamula Mwale. The song has since been used for several major charitable events and contributed towards millions of dollars of fundraising. "Hope" was performed at one of Americas largest fundraising evenings being the Starkey Hearing Foundation annual Gala in Minneapolis which was held on 26 July 2015 where Portia performed the song with live orchestra led by Paul Petterson in front of two former Presidents being President George Bush and President Bill Clinton and on the same stage as Katy Perry.

She started singing when she was just 8 years of age at Temple of Power Church in Livingston, Zambia and then joined vessels of praise at Capitol Christian Worship Centre in Lusaka at the age of 11.

{{As of|2015|09}}, Clark is recording her debut album in Australia, USA and Zambia which features the eldest son of Dr Dre, Curtis Young.

After only launching her career in 2015 she has already been nominated for best Zambian representative at the Born and Bred video awards.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Portia is currently the Zambian Ambassador for Health Hope Zambia and works to reduce the mortality rate at Zambia's largest malnutrition facility.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Image:Páll Melsteð.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Páll Melsteð in 1876.]]
'''Páll Melsteð''' (13 November 1812 - 9 February 1910) was an [[Iceland]]ic historian, official, editor and member of the [[Althing]]. In 1892 he was awarded the [[Order of the Dannebrog]].

==Early life==

Páll was the son of [[Páll Melsteð (amtmann)|Páll Melsteð]] the official. At the age of 16 Páll entered the [[Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík|Learned School]] and graduated in 1834. He then went to study law at the [[University of Copenhagen]] but also studied history and the fine arts, especially singing. He returned to Iceland in 1840 when he married his first wife, Jórunn Ísleifsdóttir. They lived in [[Álftanes]] for several years where Páll started working on his first book, ''Ágrip af merkisatburðum mannkynssögunnar'' ["A Synopsis of the Significant Events of History"], which was printed in [[Viðey]] in 1844. He had also started work on a history of Iceland but in 1844 his house burnt down and his manuscripts were lost.

==Editor==

Páll now moved to [[Reykjavík]] where he was the prime mover in founding ''Reykjavíkurpósturinn'' at a time when no newspaper was being published in Iceland. Páll had a role in editing the paper from 1846 through 1849. In 1848 he also played a role in founding ''[[Þjóðólfur]]''. He also had a large role in the first years of ''Íslendingur'' (1860–1863) and was the editor of ''Víkverji'' in 1873 and 1874.

==Official==
[[Image:Þóra Melsteð.jpg|right|thumb|Þóra Melsteð]]
In 1848 and 1849 Páll was the [[sýslumaður]] (a kind of [[sheriff]]) of [[Árnessýsla]] but from 1849 to 1854 he was the sýslumaður of [[Snæfellsnessýsla]]. He was elected as a representative of [[Snæfellsnes]] to the [[National Assembly of 1851]] and to the [[Althing]] in 1859. In 1855 Páll again went again to Copenhagen to study law since he had not completed a degree the first time. He graduated in Danish laws in 1857. From 1858 to 1862 Páll was sýslumaður for [[Gullbringu- og Kjósarsýsla]]. In 1858 Jórunn died and Páll married his second wife, [[Þóra Melsteð]]. They were to work together on establishing [[Kvennaskólinn]], the first girls' school of Iceland.

==Historian==

From 1862 to 1885 Páll worked as a lawyer in Reykjavík. In 1868 he started teaching part-time at the Learned School and in 1885 he became a full-time history professor. In the 1860s Páll wrote and published a multi-volume work on world history, ''Fornaldarsagan'' (1864), ''Miðaldarsagan'' (1866), ''Nýja sagan'' (1868). In 1891 his ''Norðurlandasaga'' ["History of the Nordic Countries"] was published. He also wrote a number of historical articles in various periodicals. Páll's historical writings were praised for their lively and lucid writing style but criticized for their heavy emphasis on warfare and giving short shrift to cultural history. Páll's memoirs, ''Endurminningar'', were published posthumously in 1912.

Those Executive Orders set up a [[Guantanamo Review Task Force]], intended to replace OARDEC.
In October 2013, [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests submitted by [[Carol Rosenberg]] and her colleagues at the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' triggered the publication of a list of ''"final dispositions"''.&lt;ref name=OfficialGuantanamoDispositions&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5841">The '''research-based design''' process is a research process proposed by Teemu Leinonen inspired by design theories.&lt;ref&gt;Ehn, P. &amp; Kyng, M. (1987). "The Collective Resource Approach to Systems Design". In G. Bjerknes, P. Ehn &amp; M. Kyng (Eds.), ''Computers and Democracy: A Scandinavian Challenge'' (pp. 17–57).Avebury.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schön, D.A. (1987). ''Educating the Reflective Practitioner. Toward a New Design for Teaching and Learning in the Professions''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, H. &amp; Stolterman, E. (2003). The Design Way: Intentional Change in an Unpredictable World: Foundations and Fundamentals of Design Competence. New Jersey: Educational Technology Publications&lt;/ref&gt; It is strongly oriented towards the building of [[prototype]]s and it emphasizes creative solutions, exploration of various ideas and design concepts, continuous testing and redesign of the design solutions. This method is also influenced by the [[Participatory design#History in Scandinavia|Scandinavian participatory design]] approach. Therefore, most of the activities take place in a close [[dialogue]] with the community that is expected to use the tools designed.

==Phases==
The process can be divided into four major phases, although they all happen concurrently and side-by-side. At different times of the research, researchers are asked to put more effort into different phases. The continuous iteration, however, asks researchers to keep all the phases alive all the time: contextual inquiry, participatory design, product design, prototype as hypothesis.

===Contextual inquiry===
{{See also|Contextual inquiry}}
Contextual inquiry refers to the exploration of the socio-cultural context of the design. The aim is to understand the environment, situation, and culture where the design takes place. The results of the contextual inquiry are better understanding of the context by recognizing in it possible challenges and design opportunities. In this phase, design researchers use [[Ethnography|rapid ethnographic]] methods, such as [[Participant observation|participatory observation]], note-taking, sketching, informal conversations, and interviews. At the same time as the field work, the design researchers are doing a focused review of the literature, benchmarking existing solutions, and analyzing trends in the area in order to develop insights into the design challenges.

===Participatory design===
{{See also|Participatory design}}
Throughout the contextual inquiry design researchers start to develop some preliminary design ideas, which would be validated during the next stage—participatory design—in workshops with different stakeholders. The participatory design sessions tend to take place with small groups of 4 to 6 participants. A common practice is to present the results as [[User scenario|scenarios]] made by the design researchers containing challenges and design opportunities. In the workshop, the participants are invited to come up with design solutions to the challenges and to bring to the discussion new challenges and solutions.

Since one of the main features of the research-based design is its participatory nature, the user's involvement is an integral part of the process. In this regard, participatory design workshops are organized during the different stages in order to validate initial ideas and discuss the prototypes at different stage of development.

===Product design===
{{See also|Product design}}
The results of the participatory design are analyzed in a [[design studio]] by the design researchers who use the feedback to redefine the design problems and redesign the prototypes. By keeping a distance from the stakeholders, in the product design phase the design researchers will get a chance to analyze the results of the participatory design, categorize them, use specific design language related to implementation of the prototypes, and finally make design decisions.

===Prototype as hypothesis===
Ultimately, the prototypes are developed to be functional on a level that they can be tested with real people in their everyday situations. The prototypes are still considered to be a hypothesis, prototypes as hypothesis, because they are expected to be part of the solutions for the challenges defined and redefined during the research. It remains to the stakeholders to decide whether they support the assertions made by the design researchers.

Research-based design is not to be confused with design-based research.&lt;ref&gt;Barab, S.A. &amp; Squire, K. (2004). Design-Based Research: Putting a Stake in the Ground. Journal of the Learning Sciences, 13(1), 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Design-Based Research Collective. (2003). Design-based research: An emerging paradigm for educational inquiry. Educational Researcher, 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fallman, D. (2007). Why Research-Oriented Design Isn’t Design-Oriented Research: On the Tensions Between Design and Research in an Implicit Design Discipline. Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy, 20(3), 193-200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leinonen, T., Toikkanen, T. &amp; Silfvast, K. (2008). Software as Hypothesis: Research-Based Design Methodology. In the Proceedings of Participatory Design Conference 2008. Presented at the Participatory Design Conference, PDC 2008, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA: ACM.&lt;/ref&gt; In research-based design, which builds on art and design tradition, the focus is on the artifacts, the end-results of the design. The way the artifacts are, the affordances and features they have or do not have, form an important part of the research argumentation. As such, research-based design as a methodological approach includes research, design, and design interventions that are all intertwined.

'''Ricardo Alarcón de Quesada''' (born 21 May 1937) is a [[Cuban people|Cuban]] politician. He served as Cuba's Permanent Representative to the [[United Nations]] (UN) for nearly 30 years and later served as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Cuba)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1992 to 1993. Subsequently, Alarcón was President of the [[National Assembly of People's Power]] from 1993 to 2013, and because of this post, was considered the third-most powerful figure in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cuba parliament opens as Fidel Castro visits|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-21568158|accessdate=24 February 2013|newspaper=BBC World Service|date=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also was a Member of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-23157254 Cuba removes Ricardo Alarcon from top Communist body]&lt;/ref&gt;

A graduate of the [[University of Havana]] with a doctorate in philosophy, he served in various diplomatic posts following the [[Cuban Revolution]]. His first post in connection with Cuba's foreign policy was as Head of the Americas Division of Cuba's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Cuba)|Foreign Ministry]]. During his tenure as Permanent Representative to the UN Alarcón held several leading offices, such as Vice President of the General Assembly of the United Nations.

==Life and career (1937–1993)==
Alarcón was born in [[Havana]] on 21 May 1937. He entered the University of Havana in 1954 and graduated with a degree as a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctor of Philosophy and Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Lamrani, Salim |author2=Alarcón, Ricardo | title = United States Against Cuba: The War on Terrorism and the Five Case | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JVAMeNkQfwcC&amp;dq | page = 197 | publisher = Editorial El Viejo Topo | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-84-96356-37-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alarcón became active in the Federation of University Students (FEU), serving as the secretary of culture for the FEU from 1955 to 1956. Alarcón would become active in Castro's [[26th of July Movement]], which was attempting to oust Cuban [[President of Cuba|President]] [[Fulgencio Batista]], in July 1955. Alarcón assisted in the organization of the student apparatus of the guerrilla organization's youth brigade. Alarcón was elected the FEU's Vice President in 1959, and would serve as the President of the Student Organization from 1961 to 1962. However, unlike the Castros, Alarcón was active in the urban underground resistance, and not the guerilla movement located in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Ann Louise Bardach|Bardach, Ann Louise]] | title = Without Fidel: A Death Foretold in Miami, Havana, and Washington | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5_BCdYfwqGQC&amp;dq | volume = 3 | page = 205 | publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4165-5150-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the new Castro-led government appointed Alarcón as the Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Americas division, where he would begin his diplomatic career. Between 1966 and 1978 he served as Permanent Representative of Cuba to the [[United Nations]], Vice President of the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]], President of the Council of Administration to the United Nations Development Programme, and Vice-President of the United Nations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. In 1978 Alarcón was promoted to first vice-minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref name=Parl&gt;[http://www.parlamentocubano.cu/ASANAC/espanol/presidente.htm Profile at Cuban parliament website] {{es icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While serving as Permanent Representative to the UN for a second time, Alarcón was [[President of the United Nations Security Council|President of the Security Council]] in February 1990 and July 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/scpres1990.htm "Presidents of the Security Council : 1990-1999"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018015052/http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/scpres1990.htm |date=October 18, 2012 }}, UN.org.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 was made Minister of Foreign Affairs, and in February 1993 he became the President of the National Assembly.&lt;ref name=Parl/&gt;

==President of the National Assembly (1993–2013)==
Alarcón took over the office of President of the [[National Assembly of People's Power]] in 1993 in what Ben Corbett, a historian, considered a "demotion" from his earlier post as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Cuba)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Corbett, Ben | title = This Is Cuba: An Outlaw Culture Survives | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sORNzu-XXfUC&amp;dq | volume = | page = 256 | publisher = [[Basic Books]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8133-4224-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, William E. Ratliff and Roger W. Fontaine, in their book, ''A Strategic Flip-flop in the Caribbean: Lift the Embargo on Cuba'', ranks Alarcón as third-most powerful figure in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Ratliff, William E. |author2=Fontaine, Roger W. | title = A Strategic Flip-flop in the Caribbean: Lift the Embargo on Cuba | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fz9jQ99bRe8C&amp;dq | volume = | page = 68 | publisher = [[Hoover Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-8179-4352-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One year after taking office, Alarcón travelled to the United States as the head of a five-member delegation to talk about the migration issues between the two countries. In a Government statement, Alarcón was described as the "best qualified" to deal with such delicate issues as emigration, and his knowledge of the "fundamental causes" to mass emigration from Cuba. Alarcón, along with the Cuba's Government, believes that the [[United States embargo against Cuba|United States economic embargo against Cuba]] is the main blame for the mass emigration from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Staff writer]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/31/world/flight-from-cuba-cuba-names-leader-for-talks-with-us.html|title=Flight from Cuba; Cuba Names Leader For Talks With U.S.|accessdate=17 February 2011 | location=New York City, New York| work=[[The New York Times]] | date=31 August 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The negotiations were suspended for a while when he abruptly travelled to Cuba to discuss the situation with the Cuban Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lewis, Paul|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/08/world/us-cuban-talks-suspended-as-envoy-returns-to-havana.html|title=U.S.-Cuban Talks Suspended As Envoy Returns to Havana |accessdate=17 February 2011 | location=New York City, New York| work=[[The New York Times]] | date=8 September 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his abrupt visit to Cuba, he returned to the United States and continued the negotiations. When he returned to the United States, he was more positive in tone, and several Cuban officials told the media that an agreement could be reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Golden, Tim|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/09/world/cuba-in-shift-says-deal-can-be-reached-with-the-us.html|title=Cuba, in Shift, Says Deal Can Be Reached With the U.S. |accessdate=17 February 2011 | location=New York City, New York| work=[[The New York Times]] | page = 1| date=9 September 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alarcón was able to reach an agreement with the [[United States Government]] on 9 September 1994, and the United States promised to issue at least 20,000 immigrant visas a year for Cuban citizens seeking to leave their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Golden, Tim|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/22/world/cuban-official-criticizes-lag-by-the-us-in-issuing-visas.html|title=Cuban Official Criticizes Lag By the U.S. in Issuing Visas. |accessdate=17 February 2011 | location=New York City, New York| work=[[The New York Times]] | page = | date=22 September 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2000, Alarcón was involved in a minor dispute with the United States when he was denied a visa to attend an international conference in [[New York City]]. Alarcón lived in [[Manhattan]] for over twelve years but because of his status as a Cuban government official he is only allowed within a 25-mile radius of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Staff writer]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/901925.stm|title=Cuban politician denied US visa|accessdate=17 February 2011 | location=London, United Kingdom| publisher=[[BBC Online]] | page = | date=29 August 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2003, United States [[Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security]] [[John R. Bolton]] charged that Cuba, along with [[Iran]], [[North Korea]], [[Syria]], and [[Libya]], were "[[rogue state]]s...whose pursuit of [[weapons of mass destruction]] makes them hostile to U.S. interests [and who] will learn that their covert programs will not escape either detection or consequences." In response, Alarcón called Bolton "a liar" and cited US claims pertaining to [[Iraq]]'s [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] in justification of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]] which were later found to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Staff writer]]|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/dec/31/20031231-111715-9034r/|title=Cuban leader sees invasion risk as ‘real’|accessdate=17 February 2011 | location=New York City, New York| work=[[The New York Times]] | page = | date=31 December 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Alarcón stated: "At some moment, US rhetoric changed to talk of democracy... For me, the starting point is the recognition that democracy should begin with [[Pericles]]'s definition – that society is for the benefit of the majority – and should not be imposed from outside."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cuba/story/0,,1836031,00.html|title=Propaganda war grips a land crippled by shortages|author=Campbell, Duncan |accessdate=17 February 2011 | location=London, United Kingdom | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=3 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[2006–2008 Cuban transfer of presidential duties|transfer of presidential duties]] to his brother [[Raúl Castro]], Alarcón told the foreign media that Fidel would be fit to run for re-election to the assembly in [[Cuban legislative election, 2008|January 2008 parliamentary election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Staff writer]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6456747.stm|title=Castro 'to be fit to hold power'|accessdate=17 February 2011 | location=London, United Kingdom | publisher=[[BBC Online]] | date=15 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview with the [[CNN]], Alarcón said he was unsure if Fidel would accept the post or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lacey, Marc|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFDA1E3BF930A15752C0A96E9C8B63&amp;|title=The Americas; Cuba: Will Castro Return? |accessdate=17 February 2011 | location=New York City, New York| work=[[The New York Times]] | page = | date=23 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alarcón, in an interview on the topic on who would succeed Fidel Castro, said; "All those who have been trying to fool the world and put out the idea that something terrible would happen in Cuba, that people would take to the streets, that there would be great instability, the door slammed on them and they must have very swollen hands now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Miller, Jimmy|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1525878/Succession-talk-fuels-the-Cuban-rumour-mill.html|title=Succession talk fuels the Cuban rumour mill |accessdate=17 February 2011 | location=London, United Kingdom| work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date=8 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Alarcon was married to Margarita Perea Maza. She died on 9 February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;''The Miami Herald''; "Wife of Cuban Official Dies After Long Illness"; 12 February 2008, Page 7A&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:RimaCI.jpg|right|thumb|Rima as first glimpsed by Abel (and comic book readers) in the 1951  ''[[Classics Illustrated]]'' adaptation, published in 1952]]
'''Rima''', also known as '''Rima the Jungle Girl''', is the fictional heroine of [[William Henry Hudson|W. H. Hudson's]] 1904 novel ''[[Green Mansions|Green Mansions: A Romance of the Tropical Forest]]''. In it,  Rima, a [[Jungle girl (stock character)|primitive girl]] of the shrinking rain forest of South America, meets Abel, a political fugitive. A movie of ''[[Green Mansions (film)|Green Mansions]]'' was made in 1959 starring [[Audrey Hepburn]]. In 1974, the character was adapted into the [[comic book]] ''Rima the Jungle Girl'', published by [[DC Comics]]. Though ''Rima the Jungle Girl'' ceased publication in 1975, the comic book version of Rima appeared in several episodes of [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera's]] popular [[Saturday morning cartoon]] series, ''[[Superfriends|The All-New Superfriends Hour]]'', between 1977 and 1980.
[[File:Charcoal and chalk drawing of Audrey Hepburn.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Rima the Jungle Girl was played by Audrey Hepburn in the 1959 film ''Green Mansions.'']]

==Novel==
Like her literary cousins [[Tarzan]] and [[Mowgli]], Rima sprang from an Edwardian adventure novel; in her case, ''[[Green Mansions|Green Mansions: A Romance of the Tropical Forest]]'',  by [[William Henry Hudson|W. H. Hudson]], published in 1904. Hudson was an Argentine-British naturalist who wrote many classic books about the ecology of South America. Hudson based Rima on a South American legend about a lost tribe of white people who lived in the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rob | last=Schmidt |url=http://newspaperrock.bluecorncomics.com/2009/11/rima-native-white-girl.htm |title=Rima the "Native" white girl |work=Newspaper Rock |publisher=[[BlueCornComics.com]]|date=November 11, 2009|accessdate=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book has a religious tone and Rima's speech is poetic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0E5QtomF2QC&amp;dq=editions:mc7vmAI5TVcC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Google Books About page for the 1989 edition.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a romantic adventure set in the South American jungle in which a political fugitive named Abel meets Rima, a girl living in the forest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MUmgAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=editions:mc7vmAI5TVcC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Google Books About Page of the 1943 edition.]&lt;/ref&gt; Its theme is the loss of wilderness and the return-to-nature dream, and how unpleasant it would be for a savage to meet modern man (the reverse case is not considered).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LFMRAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=editions:mc7vmAI5TVcC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Google Books About page of 1916 edition.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rima starred in a seven-issue [[comic book]] series, [[DC Comics]]' ''Rima the Jungle Girl'' (May 1974&amp;nbsp;– May 1975), adapted by an uncredited writer and with artwork by [[penciler]]-[[inker]] [[Nestor Redondo]] and covers by [[Joe Kubert]]. DC writer-editor [[Robert Kanigher]] is the credited writer from issue #5 on. A variation of the character debuted in a six-issue DC Comics limited series May 2010 to Mar 2011 ''[[First Wave (comics)|First Wave]]'', written by Eisner Award–winning writer Brian Azzarello. Rima is here portrayed as a South American native with piercings and tattoos; she does not speak, but instead communicates in bird-like whistles.&lt;ref name=morales&gt;{{cite web |first=Alex |last=Segura |url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2009/11/09/how-about-some-more-rags-morales%E2%80%99-sketches-from-first-wave/ |title=How About Some More Rags Morales' Sketches From First Wave? |work=The Source |publisher=[[DC Comics.com]] |date=November 9, 2009 |accessdate=November 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110721151342/http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2009/11/09/how-about-some-more-rags-morales%E2%80%99-sketches-from-first-wave/ |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the DC character is a fully grown and powerful woman with [[Blond#platinum blond|ash blonde]] hair, the novel's Rima was 17, small (4′ 6″), demure, and dark-haired. Natives avoided her forest, calling her "the Daughter of the Didi" (an evil spirit). Rima's only defense was a reputation for magic earned through the display of strange talents such as talking to birds, befriending animals, and plucking poison darts from the air.  Although in the original book Rima was burned alive by Indian savages, in the comics she escaped the fire to have further adventures.

===Comic book titles===
These [[comic book]] titles feature the Rima character:

====''Classics Illustrated'' #90: ''Green Mansions''====
[[Classics Illustrated]] published a short adaptation from the novel, with direct quotes.  In this adaptation Rima is blond. (Copyright December 1951 Gilberton Company).

====''Rima the Jungle Girl''====
Title character 1974–1975

====''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen''====
Rima is mentioned, but not seen, in [[America's Best Comics]]' ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' vol. 2, #3 (2003), by writer [[Alan Moore]] and artists [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] and [[Ben Dimagmaliw]]: "...it is near here that the world-famous 'bird girl' Riolama or Rima was discovered..."

====''First Wave''====
Rima is re-imagined in DC's 2010 title ''[[First Wave (comics)|First Wave]]''.

==Cartoons==
Rima the Jungle Girl appeared in three episodes of [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'' during the 1977–78 season, alongside such mainstays as [[Aquaman]], [[Batman]], and [[Wonder Woman]]. In her run with the ''Super Friends'' TV series, she is often known for being one of the new 'affirmative action heroes' during that period. Along with characters [[Apache Chief]], [[Black Vulcan]], and [[Samurai (Super Friends)|Samurai]], Rima is considered a minority character.

She first appears in "Fire" (October 1, 1977). [[Batman]], [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], and Rima the Jungle Girl contend with a spreading forest fire, and have to search for a pair of escaped prisoners who have stolen a forestry truck filled with dynamite.  Rima's main contribution is to call upon a nearby bear to push down some trees for an emergency bridge across a wide gap. Her next appearance is in "River of Doom" (November 4, 1977): [[Wonder Woman]] and Rima the Jungle Girl search for archaeologists who have accidentally stumbled onto a burial ground of angry natives. The archaeologists are captured and sentenced to death on the River of Doom.  The superheroes find the would-be victims by using indigenous animals to scout them out at Rima's command.  They later rescue the scientists. Rima's main contribution is summoning [[crocodile]]s to attack their pursuers' canoes. Finally, she is featured in "Return of Atlantis", from October 25, 1980. Aquaman is captured by Queen Ocina when the lost city of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]] rises from the sea. Ocina plans to conquer the world with her female warriors, but Wonder Woman and Rima gather the Amazons of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]] to stop her.  Note: In breach of both DC Comics' and the ''Super Friends'' TV show's continuities, this "Atlantis" is not the kingdom over which [[Aquaman]] reigns.

==Other appearances==
Rima was mentioned in [[Ray Bradbury]]'s 1950 short story, "[[The Veldt (short story)|The Veldt]]". Rima was also mentioned in "Watcher in the Shadows" by Geoffrey Household (1960; reissued 2010) and also in "Vane Pursuit" by Charlotte MacLeod (1989).

[[Dornford Yates]] mentioned her in Chapter I of his 1931 comic-detective novel ''Adele and Co.'', in connection with the Hudson Memorial (see below).

===Statue===
The Hudson Memorial in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], created in 1925, has a [[bas-relief]] of Rima the Bird Girl sculpted by [[Jacob Epstein]].&lt;ref&gt;http://londonist.com/2013/09/the-day-peter-pan-was-tarred-and-feathered.php Image of statue with history of praise and criticism&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] '''Sir Fenton John Aylmer, 13th Baronet''', [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] (5 April 1862 – 3 September 1935) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]]. He was in command of the first failed efforts to break the [[siege of Kut]] in 1916.  From a military background, Aylmer was commissioned into the Indian Army, and immediately involved in fierce fighting on the north-west frontier.  In a singularly heroic action, still in his twenties, he helped rescue Townshend's garrison at [[Chitral]], spearheading the relief column.  For his valorous conduct he was awarded the Victoria Cross, and rapid promotion through the officer class.

==Early career==
Born the son of Captain Fenton John Aylmer (24 December 1835 – 9 April 1862) and Isabella Eleanor Darling (died 27 December 1908).&lt;ref name="Peerage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thepeerage.com/p12792.htm#i127917 |title=Lt.-Gen. Sir Fenton John Aylmer, 13th Bt., V.C. |work=The Peerage |date=29 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aylmer attended the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], as a Gentleman Cadet and was promoted [[Lieutenant]] on 27 July 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24870|page=4258|date=3 August 1880}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in the Burma expedition between 1886 and 1887.&lt;ref name=lh&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/locreg/AYLMER1.shtml Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Victoria Cross==
Fenton was 29 years old, and a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in the [[Corps of Royal Engineers]], [[British Army]] and [[Bengal Sappers &amp; Miners]] ([[British Indian Army]]),&lt;ref name=rem&gt;[http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/ccroyeng.htm The Royal Engineers Museum - Victoria Crosses held by the Royal Engineers Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Hunza–Nagar Campaign]], India when he won the [[Victoria Cross]] in 1891 for the following deed:
{{Quote|On 2 December 1891 during the assault on [[Nilt Fort]], [[British India]], Captain Aylmer, with the storming party, forced open the inner gate with gun-cotton which he had placed and ignited, and although severely wounded, fired 19 shots with his revolver, killing several of the enemy, and remained fighting until, fainting from loss of blood, he was carried out of action.&lt;ref name=LG1&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26306|page=4006|date=12 July 1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He was promoted [[Major]] on 18 October 1893 in recognition of his services during the Hunza-Nagar Expedition,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26450|page=5833|date=17 October 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of the [[Chitral Expedition]] in 1895.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; Further service with the Royal Engineers saw him promoted a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Lieutenant-colonel (British Army)|Lieutenant-colonel]]. In July 1901 he was appointed Assistant [[Quartermaster general]] in India, and promoted to the substantive rank of [[Colonel (British Army)|Colonel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27383 |date=6 December 1901 |page=8642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, in March 1912, having been promoted to [[major-general]], he became [[Adjutant-General (India)|Adjutant-General, India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Army%20Commands%201900-2011.pdf Army Commands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705000000/http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Army%20Commands%201900-2011.pdf |date=5 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 he married Lady Risley, the widow of Sir Herbert Risley, head of the Indian Civil Service.  Born Elsie Julie Oppermann, daughter of Friedrich Oppermann, she was considered a great beauty and had, for many years prior to her marriage to him had an affair with Aylmer—an affair that was well-known within Indian society and apparently tolerated by Sir Herbert.&lt;ref name="Peerage"/&gt; Lady Aylmer died on 18 July 1934.&lt;ref name="Peerage"/&gt;

==World War I==
Having been promoted to [[lieutenant general]], Aylmer was put in charge of the first effort to end the [[siege of Kut]].  General Aylmer was in command of the [[Tigris Corps]], consisting of the [[7th (Meerut) Division]], the [[12th Indian Division]], and a number of other smaller military units.  All told he had more than 20,000 men. They left [[Basra]] in late December 1915 and arrived at Sheikh Sa'ad on 3 January 1916.&lt;ref name=tucker&gt;Tucker, p. 1,233&lt;/ref&gt; While the 12th Indian Division (under command of General [[GF Gorringe|George Gorringe]]) made a diversionary move near Nasiriyeh, the 7th (under the command of General Younghusband) staged a direct assault on the Ottoman positions on 6 January (the [[Battle of Sheikh Sa'ad]]).&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt; After two days of fighting, the Ottoman army withdrew. The British sustained approximately 4,000 casualties - much more than the medical units could cope with.&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt; The Ottoman troops, under the generalship of [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz|Baron von der Goltz]] only withdrew some six miles up river and occupied another defensive position near the edge of the Suwaikiya Marshes.  A British assault on this position on 13 January was partially successful, the position was carried but again with significant losses (some 1,600 casualties) (the Battle of Wadi).&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt;

By now, a third division had been added to Aylmer's Tigris Corps, the [[3rd (Lahore) Division]].  This new division, along with the weakened 7th Division, attacked Ottoman defensive works at Hanna on 21 January (the [[Battle of Hanna]]).  This assault was a complete failure.  The Ottoman troops held their trench lines while some 2,700 British soldiers were killed or wounded.&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt;

General Aylmer was reinforced with another division, the [[13th (Western) Division]].  The next month was spent resting the troops and probing the Ottoman defensive positions.  With time running out on Major-General [[Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend|Townshend]]'s garrison in [[Kut]], Aylmer finally launched a two pronged attack on the Ottoman positions, one attack at the Sinn Abtar Redoubt, the other attack at the [[Battle of Dujaila|Dujaila Redoubt]]. The attacks were launched on 7 March 1916.  Both attacks failed due to lack of initiative and an inability to coordinate the timing of the assaults: they ended up being sequential, not simultaneous as was intended.  The British lost some 4,000 casualties.&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt;

Fenton Aylmer was replaced by the former commander of the 12th Indian division, Major-General [[GF Gorringe|George Gorringe]]. He did not command in battle again, retiring from the British Army in 1919.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; However, from 1922 till his death he was the Commandant of the [[Royal Engineers]].&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; Following his death in 1935 he was cremated at the [[Golders Green Crematorium]] where his ashes remain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6821519 Fenton John Aylmer] at Find-A-Grave&lt;/ref&gt;

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the [[Royal Engineers Museum]] in [[Chatham, Kent]], England.&lt;ref name=rem/&gt;

'''''Starsuckers''''' is a 2009 British documentary film aiming to expose the "shams and deceit involved in creating a pernicious [[celebrity culture]]".

Directed by [[Chris Atkins (journalist)|Chris Atkins]], director of the 2007 documentary ''[[Taking Liberties (film)|Taking Liberties]]'', it shows the production team planting a variety of celebrity-related stories in the [[UK media]], such as a claim that the singer [[Avril Lavigne]] had been seen asleep in a [[nightclub]]. A variety of [[tabloid newspaper]]s accepted the stories without corroboration or evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/14/starsuckers-tabloids-hoax-celebrities Starsuckers celebrity hoax dupes tabloids], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 October 2009,&lt;/ref&gt;

The film launched as part of the [[British Film Institute]]'s 53rd Film Festival. Thirty minutes of footage from the film were shown to the [[Leveson Inquiry]] as part of the evidence presented by the film's director, Chris Atkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leveson inquiry: Chris Atkins, David Leigh, Charlotte Harris - live |author=Lisa O'Carroll and Josh Halliday |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/blog/2011/dec/06/leveson-inquiry-leigh-atkins-harris-live |newspaper=The Guardian |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal threats from Max Clifford==

On 23 October 2009, six days before the ''Starsuckers'' premiere, the makers reported that they had received an e-mail from the law firm [[Carter-Ruck]], acting on behalf of controversial [[publicist]] [[Max Clifford]] and threatening them with an [[injunction]].&lt;ref&gt;http://starsuckers3.blogspot.com/2009/10/weve-been-carter-fcked.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2010/04/starsucker-uk-media-culture/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal convictions==

In December 2015, three [[City of London|City]] traders, James Hyde, Hamish Maclellan, and Phillip Jenkins, along with their accountant Terence Potter, were convicted of conspiring to cheat [[HMRC|HM Revenue &amp; Customs]] by falsifying documents to show that they had each actively worked 10 or more hours a week on the production of Starsuckers and were eligible for tax rebates. Three other defendants were acquitted at the same trial.&lt;ref&gt;http://citywire.co.uk/new-model-adviser/news/ex-adviser-found-guilty-of-conspiracy-to-cheat-hmrc/a866698&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, two further producers of Starsuckers, Christopher Walsh Atkins and Christina Slater, were convicted of the same charge of conspiring to cheat HM Revenue &amp; Customs, and were jailed for 5 and 4 years respectively.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/r-v-walsh-atkins-and-slater.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Terence Potter was again convicted.&lt;ref&gt;http://courtnewsuk.co.uk/film-producers-guilty-movie-investment-scam&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yaakov (Yankale) Bodo''' ({{lang-he|יעקב (יענק'לה) בודו}}) (born 1931) is an Israeli actor and comedian notable for numerous [[Israeli film]] appearances, for his years in Israeli theatre, and for his work in [[Yiddish]] theatre, in particular. He is also notable for his performance as "Moishe Ventilator" (also Moishe Air-Condition [http://www.targumon.co.il/title_002627]) in the self-titled theater show that ran over a thousand times and was eventually made into a film by that name in 1966.&lt;ref name="HabamaBio"/&gt;

Bodo is a recipient of the ''Israeli Theater Award'' lifetime achievement award, the ''Edith and Israel Pollack Award'', and the ''Lerner Yiddish Foundation Award''.

==Early life==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Bodo was born in Romania in 1931 and spoke only Yiddish until the age of 7. He emigrated with his family to Israel in 1950 and settled in [[Afula]]. His grandparents were [[Zionists]] who helped establish [[Kfar Hasidim]] and Kiryat Haroshet (now part of [[Kiryat Tiv'on]]) after they emigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]] in 1933.&lt;ref name="HabamaBio"&gt;[http://www.habama.co.il/Pages/ArtPerson.aspx?PeopleID=720 Yaakov Bodo Biography page on habama.co.il]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
A year after his arrival in Israel, Bodo joined the [[Israel Defense Forces]], where he first assembled and led the [[Southern Command (Israel)|Southern Command]] Troupe. Following the disbanding of that troupe in 1954, he was assigned the creation of the [[Northern Command (Israel)|Northern Command]] troupe, which he led for three-and-a-half years.

Meanwhile, he came up with his "Moishe Ventilator" [[Character (arts)|character]].  Upon his release, he starred in a theater show by that name which was a hit in the 1950s—running more than a thousand times&lt;ref name="HabamaBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="YNET_Margalit"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3672757,00.html|title=Margalit Award for Lifetime Achievement will be Given to Yaakov Bodo|publisher=[[Ynet]]|date=16 February 2009|author=Yudilovich, Merav|accessdate=2009-07-31|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and which was eventually made into a film version.&lt;ref name="HabamaBio"/&gt;

==Theater==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Bodo performed on the stages of the institutionalized theaters [[Zira Theatre]], [[Habima Theatre]], [[Haifa Theatre]] as well as commercial theater, mostly in Yiddish, where he was successful. In 1992, he joined the [[Yiddish-Shpiel]] theatre, where he mostly performs in leading roles. Among the more notable plays he performed in were "Maagal HaGir" (lit. "The Chalk Circle"), and "Karnafim" (lit. "Rhinoceroses").

==Film==
In 1964 he performed in [[Ephraim Kishon]]'s critically acclaimed film ''[[Sallah Shabati]]'' ({{lang-he|סלאח שבתי}}), alongside notable actors and performers such as [[Chaim Topol]], [[Gila Almagor]], [[Zaharira Harifai]], [[Shaike Levi]], and [[Arik Einstein]]. The film was a satirical portrayal of the poor conditions and the integration of the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|Jewish refugees from Arab lands]] living in the [[maabara]].

In 1966, Bodo's character, ''[[Moishe Ventilator]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.habama.co.il/Pages/Event.aspx?Subj=1&amp;Area=1&amp;EventId=7433 Moishe Ventilator] on habama.co.il&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060710/ Moishe Ventilator] on IMDB&lt;/ref&gt; was picked up and made into a parody film by the same name ({{lang-he|מוישה ונטילטור}}), where, under the direction of [[Uri Zohar]], Bodo, accompanied by [[Shaike Ophir]] and the [[Gashah HaHiver]] trio, portrayed a [[frugal]] [[Private (rank)|private]] whose cost cutting ideas include cutting on maps in the [[operation room]], which are coveted by a spy who infiltrates the IDF ranks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.third-ear.com/p_prod.aspx?id=9581]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tapuz.co.il/yes/movie.asp?fid=235 Moishe Ventilator] on tapuz.co.il&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, he performed in Kishon's film ''[[Ervinka]]'' ({{lang-he|ארבינקא}}, Starred by [[Chaim Topol]]), about an incorrigible layabout who becomes involved in a robbery of the [[Mifal HaPais|Israeli lottery]] under the cover of making a documentary.

Bodo has also performed in the films ''[[The Fox in the Chicken Coop]]'' ({{lang-he|השועל בלול התרנגולות}}), ''Nahche and The General'' ({{lang-he|נחצ'ה והגנרל}}), ''Millionaire in Trouble'' ({{lang-he|מיליונר בצרות}}), ''Margo Sheli'' ({{lang-he|מרגו שלי}}), ''Take When They Give'' ({{lang-he|כשנותנים קח}}), ''Five Five'' ({{lang-he|חמש חמש}}), ''A Miracle in The Village'' ({{lang-he|נס בעיירה}}), ''Just Not on Saturday'' ({{lang-he|רק לא בשבת}}), ''Not a Word to Morgenstern'' ({{lang-he|אף מילה למורגנשטרן}}), and others.

==Awards==
Yaakov Bodo has been awarded the 2009 Israeli Theater Award lifetime achievement award, the Edith and Israel Pollack Award for 1999, and the Lerner Yiddish Foundation Award for 2000.

==Personal life==
Bodo is married with three children and has five grandchildren. He is still married to his wife and personal manager, Ester, whom he met in [[Afula]], the city that his family was sent to soon after they emigrated to Israel in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name="HabamaBio"/&gt;
