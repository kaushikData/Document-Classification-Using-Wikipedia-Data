==Regional language==
A local variety of the [[Hunsrückisch dialect]] (see: [[West Germanic languages]]) has been spoken and is part of the history of this region since pioneer days starting almost two centuries ago. Hunsrückisch is a co-official language of this municipality. Elsewhere, mostly in the western part of Santa Catarina state, but especially in the neighboring state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], the predominant German dialect is the [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]] variety of the same language group. (See also: [[Pennsylvania German language]], a mutually intelligible variety of German spoken in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]).

'''Arda Denkel''' (6 July 1949 – 21 May 2000) was a Turkish philosopher. He studied at the [[University of Oxford]]  and, under [[Peter Strawson]], wrote his D. Phil. dissertation which he later developed into a more expansive study with his book [[The Natural Background of Meaning]] in 1999.

Upon his return to [[Turkey]] he became an important promoter of [[analytical philosophy]] in Turkey, a country traditionally almost entirely cultivated within a continental atmosphere, and became a faculty member in the philosophy department at the [[Bogazici University]] in [[Istanbul]] for the rest of his life.

He was twice a visiting professor at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]] between 1985 and 1989, and served as a member of the steering committee of the [[European Society for Analytic Philosophy]] (ESAP) between 1996 and 1999.

He also authored several other books and articles in both Turkish and English, including his [[Object and Property]] in 1996. He died in 2000 after a prolonged fight with a brain tumour.

In [[structural complexity theory]], the '''Berman–Hartmanis conjecture''' is an unsolved [[conjecture]] named after Leonard C. Berman and [[Juris Hartmanis]] that states that all [[NP-complete]] languages look alike, in the sense that they can be related to each other by [[polynomial time]] [[isomorphism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Complexity Theory and Cryptology: An Introduction to Cryptocomplexity|first=Jörg|last=Rothe|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=2005|isbn=978-3-540-22147-0|contribution=3.6.2 The Berman–Hartmanis Isomorphism Conjecture and One-Way Functions|pages=108–114}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gems of Theoretical Computer Science|first1=Uwe|last1=Schöning|first2=Randall J.|last2=Pruim|publisher=Springer|year=1998|isbn=978-3-540-64425-5|contribution=15.

==Statement==
An isomorphism between [[formal language]]s ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[bijection|bijective]] map ''f'' from [[String (computer science)|string]]s in the alphabet of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to strings in the alphabet of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with the property that a string ''x'' belongs to ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if ''f''(''x'') belongs to ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a polynomial time isomorphism (or ''p''-isomorphism for short) if both ''f'' and its [[inverse function]] can be computed in an amount of time polynomial in the lengths of their arguments.

{{harvtxt|Berman|Hartmanis|1977}} observed that all languages known at that time to be NP-complete were ''p''-isomorphic. More strongly, they observed that all then-known NP-complete languages were ''paddable'', and they proved (analogously to  the [[Myhill isomorphism theorem]]) that all pairs of paddable NP-complete languages are ''p''-isomorphic. A language ''L'' is paddable if there is a polynomial time function ''f''(''x'',''y'') with a polynomial time inverse and with the property that, for all ''x'' and ''y'', ''x'' belongs to ''L'' if and only if ''f''(''x'',''y'') belongs to ''L'': that is, it is possible to [[Padding argument|pad]] the input ''x'' with irrelevant information ''y'', in an invertible way, without changing its membership in the language.
Based on these results, Berman and Hartmanis conjectured that all NP-complete languages are ''p''-isomorphic.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | title = On isomorphisms and density of NP and other complete sets

Since ''p''-isomorphism preserves paddability, and there exist paddable NP-complete languages, an equivalent way of stating the Berman–Hartmanis conjecture is that all NP-complete languages are paddable.
Polynomial time isomorphism is an [[equivalence relation]], and it can be used to partition the formal languages into [[equivalence class]]es, so another way of stating the Berman–Hartmanis conjecture is that the NP-complete languages form a single equivalence class for this relation.

==Implications==
If the Berman–Hartmanis conjecture is true, an immediate consequence would be the nonexistence of [[Sparse language|sparse]] NP-complete languages, namely languages in which the number of yes-instances of length ''n'' grows only polynomially as a function of ''n''. The known NP-complete languages have a number of yes-instances that grows exponentially, and if ''L'' is a language with exponentially many yes-instances then it cannot be ''p''-isomorphic to a sparse language, because its yes-instances would have to be mapped to strings that are more than polynomially long in order for the mapping to be one-to-one.

The nonexistence of sparse NP-complete languages in turn implies that [[P versus NP problem|P ≠ NP]], because if P = NP then every nontrivial language in P (including some sparse ones, such as the language of binary strings all of whose bits are zero) would be NP-complete. In 1982, Steve Mahaney published his proof that the nonexistence of sparse NP-complete languages (with NP-completeness defined in the standard way using [[many-one reduction]]s) is in fact equivalent to the statement that P ≠ NP; this is [[Mahaney's theorem]]. Even for a relaxed definition of NP-completeness using [[Turing reduction]]s, the existence of a sparse NP-complete language would imply an unexpected collapse of the [[polynomial hierarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Evidence==
As evidence towards the conjecture, {{harvtxt|Agrawal|Allender|Impagliazzo|Pitassi|1997}} showed that an analogous conjecture with a restricted type of reduction is true: every two languages that are complete for NP under [[AC0|AC&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;]] many-one reductions have an AC&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

{{harvtxt|Agrawal|Watanabe|2009}} showed that, if there exist [[one-way function]]s that cannot be inverted in polynomial time on all inputs, but if every such function has a small but dense subset of inputs on which it can be inverted in [[P/poly]] (as is true for known functions of this type) then every two NP-complete languages have a P/poly isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Evidence against the conjecture was provided by {{harvtxt|Joseph|Young|1985}} and {{harvtxt|Kurtz|Mahaney|Royer|1995}}. Joseph and Young introduced a class of NP-complete problems, the ''k''-creative sets, for which no ''p''-isomorphism to the standard NP-complete problems is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Kurtz et al. showed that in oracle machine models given access to a [[random oracle]], the analogue of the conjecture is not true: if ''A'' is a random oracle, then not all sets complete for NP&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; have isomorphisms in P&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Random oracles are commonly used in the theory of cryptography to model [[cryptographic hash function]]s that are computationally indistinguishable from random, and the construction of Kurtz et al. can be carried out with such a function in place of the oracle. For this reason, among others, the Berman–Hartmanis isomorphism conjecture is believed false by many complexity theorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Berman-Hartmanis Isomorphism Conjecture|first=Lance|last=Fortnow|authorlink=Lance Fortnow|date=March 28, 2003|url=http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2003/03/berman-hartmanis-isomorphism.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5933">The Spanish (or Castilian) language is spoken in [[Bolivia]] by most of the population, either as a mother tongue or as a second language. Within the Spanish of Bolivia there are different regional varieties. In the border areas, Bolivia shares dialectal features with the neighboring countries.

Throughout Bolivia the preservation of phonemic contrast between {{IPA|/ʝ/}} and the [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] {{IPA|/ʎ/}} (i.e. the absence of [[yeísmo]]) is the norm.&lt;ref&gt;Canfield 1981:28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipski 1994:188"&gt;Lipski 1994:188&lt;/ref&gt; [[Debuccalization|Aspiration]] of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is frequent in the lowlands, while in the highlands the sibilant {{IPA|/s/}} tends to be preserved, realized either as a [[Laminal consonant|laminal]] or, frequently, an [[Apical consonant|apical]] {{IPA|[s]}}.&lt;ref name="Lipski 1994:188"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Canfield 1981:29"&gt;Canfield 1981:29&lt;/ref&gt; In highland dialects, the [[Trill consonant|"trill"]] phoneme (orthographic &lt;rr&gt; or word-initial &lt;r&gt;) is often [[Assibilation|assibilated]], realized as a [[voiced apicoalveolar fricative]].&lt;ref name="Canfield 1981:29"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lipski 1994:189&lt;/ref&gt; In highland Bolivian Spanish there is "intense reduction" of unstressed vowels in contact with {{IPA|/s/}}, often resulting in syllables with {{IPA|/s/}} as their nucleus, e.g. ''pues'' ("well,...") pronounced {{IPA|[ps]}}.&lt;ref name="Lipski 1994:188"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canfield 1981:29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects of Spanish in Bolivia==

===Andean Spanish===
{{Main|Andean Spanish}}

===Camba Spanish===

This variety of Spanish is spoken on the Chaco-Beni plain and in the Santa Cruz valleys, a region that includes the departments of [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]], [[Department of Beni|Beni]], and [[Department of Pando|Pando]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Coimbra Sanz&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish is spoken by almost the entire population of these regions, and—like Spanish throughout the Americas—has its basis in [[Andalusian Spanish]], but with influences of native languages such as [[Chiquitano]], [[Chané language|Chané]] and [[Guarani language|Guarani]], as well as Old World languages including [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; And although it is fairly uniform across regions and social classes, there are subtle geographical differences.

This dialect is characterized by the [[debuccalization]] ("aspiration") of final {{IPA|/s/}}. For example, the word ''pues'' is pronounced {{IPA|[pwe]}}. For the second-person-singular pronoun and verb forms, the use of "[[voseo]]" is dominant. The use of [[diminutive]] ''&amp;#8209;ingo'' and the [[augmentative]] ''&amp;#8209;ango'' is unique to this dialect. For example: ''chiquitingo'' ("very small") and ''grandango'' ("very large").

&lt;!--This paragraph is hidden until its information can be repackaged in clear English. Begin here: The case of tropical regions of the departments of [[La Paz]] and [[Cochabamba]], there is almost a variety as in the regions of the [[Yungas]] and [[Chapare Province|Chapare]], it resembles the Andes and the valleys, further north merged with the Camba Spanish.--&gt;

===Chapaco Spanish===
This dialect is spoken mainly in the valleys and the [[Gran Chaco]] of the department of [[Tarija Department|Tarija]], but also in the region of [[Villa Abecia]] and [[Camargo, Chuquisaca|Camargo]] (in the department of [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]]), in the province of [[Sud Chichas Province|Sud Chichas]] (capital [[Tupiza]]), and in the Chaco regions of Chuquisaca and Santa Cruz. 
The second-person-singular [[voseo]] is in full use in [[Tupiza]], in the west of Tarija, and in the rest of the aforementioned areas.
The Chapaco accent has an intonation similar to that of Jujuy, Salta, and Tucumán in Argentina, as the territory where it was spoken before was the [[province of Tarija|Río de la Plata Province of Tarija]]. It has similar intonation throughout the Bolivian Chaco, Tupiza (Sud Chichas) and the Chuquisaca valleys of Camargo, Villa Abecia, Azurduy, Alcalá, etc.

===Valluno Spanish===
This variety is spoken in the departments of [[Cochabamba]] and [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]]. It is somewhat similar to  [[Andean Spanish]] but differs in intonation and the use of idiomatic expressions, due to the mixture of Spanish and [[Quechua Boliviano|Quechua]] spoken in the valleys of Bolivia.

===Vallegrandino Spanish===
{{empty section|date=March 2018}}

===Note===
Because many institutions and companies use "tú" and the "tuteante" verb forms for the familiar second-person singular, it is common to encounter the erroneous statement that "tuteo" rather than "voseo" is the usual form in the speech of Bolivia.

A '''cross-border language''' or '''trans-border language''' is a language spoken by a population ([[ethnic group]] or [[nation]]) that lives in a geographical area in two or several internationally recognized countries that have common land or maritime borders. Cross-border languages are particularly common in [[Africa]] but are found on all other continents as well.

Examples include German (spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and other neighbouring countries), Catalan (spoken in Spain, Andorra and elsewhere), Hungarian (spoken in most countries bordering Hungary) and Gaelic (spoken in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]]).

A '''dialer management platform''' ('''DMP''') is used to dynamically update the information held within a [[least cost routing]] dialler.  The dialler is programmed to call into the DMP periodically, when it does it can supply the [[service provider]] with information such as calling patterns.

The DMP at the same time can reprogram the dialler with new [[routing table]]s in order to supply the end user better calling rates.

'''Edo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|d|oʊ}})&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; (with diacritics, ''Ẹ̀dó''; also called '''Bini''' (Benin)) is a [[Volta–Niger language]] spoken primarily in [[Edo State]], [[Nigeria]]. It is the primary language of the [[Edo people]] and was the primary language spoken in the [[Benin Empire]] and its predecessor, [[Igodomigodo]].

==Phonology==

=== Vowels ===
There are seven vowels, {{IPA|/i e ɛ a ɔ o u/}}, all of which may be long or nasal, and three tones.

=== Consonants ===
Edo has a rather average consonant inventory for an [[Edoid language]]. It maintains only a single phonemic nasal, {{IPA|/m/}}, but has 13 oral consonants, {{IPA|/ɺ, l, ʋ, j, w/}} and the 8 stops, which have nasal allophones such as {{IPA|[n, ɲ, ŋʷ]}} before nasal vowels.

The three [[rhotic consonant|rhotics]] have been described as voiced and voiceless trills plus a lax English-type approximant. However, Ladefoged&lt;ref&gt;{{SOWL}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page missing|date=August 2018}} found all three to be approximants, with the voiced–voiceless pair being [[raised (phonetics)|raised]] (without being fricatives) and perhaps at a slightly different [[place of articulation]] compared to the third, but not trills.

=== Phonotactics ===
Syllable structure is simple, being maximally CVV, where VV is either a long vowel or {{IPA|/i, u/}} plus a different oral or nasal vowel.

== Orthography ==
The Edo alphabet has separate letters for the nasalised allophones of {{IPA|/ʋ/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}, ''mw'' and ''n'':

|}
Long vowels are written by doubling the letter. Nasal vowels may be written with a final -n or with an initial nasal consonant. Tone may be written with acute accent, grave accent, and unmarked, or with a final -h (-nh with a nasal vowel).

A '''fishing trawler''' is a commercial [[fishing vessel]] designed to operate [[Trawling|fishing trawls]]. Trawling is a method of fishing that involves actively dragging or pulling a trawl through the water behind one or more trawlers. Trawls are [[fishing nets]] that are pulled along the bottom of the sea or in midwater at a specified depth. A trawler may also operate two or more trawl nets simultaneously (double-rig and multi-rig).

There are many variants of trawling gear. They vary according to local traditions, bottom conditions, and how large and powerful the trawling boats are. A trawling boat can be a small open boat with only 30&amp;nbsp;[[horsepower]] or a large [[factory ship]] with 10,000&amp;nbsp;horsepower. Trawl variants include beam trawls, large-opening midwater trawls, and large bottom trawls, such as "rock hoppers" that are rigged with heavy rubber wheels that let the net crawl over rocky bottom.

==History==
{{main article|History of fishing}}
[[File:A Brixham trawler.jpg|thumb|Painting of ''A Brixham trawler'' by [[William Adolphus Knell]]. The painting is now in the [[National Maritime Museum]].]]
During the 17th century, the British developed the [[Dogger (boat)|Dogger]], an early type of sailing trawler commonly operated in the [[North Sea]]. The Dogger takes its name from the [[Dutch language|Dutch word]] ''dogger'', meaning a fishing vessel which tows a [[trawl]].&lt;ref name="OCSS"&gt;Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Doggers were slow but sturdy, capable of fishing in the rough conditions of the North Sea.&lt;ref name="Fagan"&gt;Fagan 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern fishing trawler was developed in the 19th century, at the English fishing port of [[Brixham]]. By the early 19th century, the fishermen at Brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the [[overfishing|overfished]] waters of [[South Devon]]. The [[Brixham trawler]] that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall [[gaff rig]], which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean. They were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water. The great trawling fleet that built up at Brixham, earned the village the title of 'Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries'.

This revolutionary design made large scale trawling in the ocean possible for the first time, resulting in a massive migration of fishermen from the ports in the South of England, to villages further north, such as [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Grimsby]], [[Harwich]] and [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], that were points of access to the large fishing grounds in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The small village of [[Grimsby]] grew to become the 'largest fishing port in the world'&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.independent.co.uk/uk/article176414.ece Days out: “Gone fishing in Grimsby”]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[The Independent]]'', 8 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; by the mid 19th century. With the tremendous expansion in the fishing industry, the [[Grimsby Docks|Grimsby Dock Company]] was opened in 1854 as the first modern fishing port.&lt;ref name=lochist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/grimsby.html |title=A brief history of Grimsby |publisher=localhistories.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facilities incorporated many innovations of the time – the dock gates and cranes were operated by [[hydraulic power network|hydraulic power]], and the {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Grimsby Dock Tower]] was built to provide a head of water with sufficient pressure by [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk-genealogy.org.uk/england/Lincolnshire/towns/GreatGrimsby.html |title=Great Grimsby |publisher=UK Genealogy Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elegant [[Brixham trawler]] spread across the world, influencing fishing fleets everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kjappeal.org/history.html |title=History of a Brixham trawler |author= |date=2 March 2009 |website= |publisher=JKappeal.org |accessdate=13 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202015738/http://kjappeal.org/history.html |archivedate=2 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/news/112001/27/brixham_trawler.shtml |title=Pilgrim's restoration under full sail |author= |date= |website= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, there were over 3,000 fishing trawlers in commission in Britain, with almost 1,000 at Grimsby. These trawlers were sold to fishermen around Europe, including from the [[Netherlands]] and [[Scandinavia]]. Twelve trawlers went on to form the nucleus of the German fishing fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sailing trawlers|url=http://issuu.com/tobyrussell/docs/brixham_sailing_trawlers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advent of steam power===
The earliest steam powered fishing boats first appeared in the 1870s and used the [[trawl]] system of fishing as well as lines and drift nets.  These were large boats, usually {{convert|80|–|90|ft}} in length with a beam of around {{convert|20|ft}}. They weighed 40–50 tons and travelled at {{convert|9|–|11|kn}}.

The earliest purpose built fishing vessels were designed and made by David Allan in [[Leith]] in March 1875, when he converted a drifter to steam power. In 1877, he built the first [[screw propeller|screw propelled]] [[steamship|steam trawler]] in the world. This vessel was ''Pioneer LH854''. She was of wooden construction with two masts and carried a gaff rigged main and mizen using booms, and a single foresail. Allan argued that his motivation for steam power was to increase the safety of fishermen. However local fishermen saw power trawling as a threat. Allan built a total of ten boats at [[Leith]] between 1877 and 1881. Twenty-one boats were completed at [[Granton, Edinburgh|Granton]], his last vessel being ''Degrave'' in 1886. Most of these were sold to foreign owners in [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Spain]] and the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref name="grantontrawlers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantontrawlers.com/steam%20trawler.html|title=The Steam Trawler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[steam boat]]s were made of wood, but [[steel]] [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]s were soon introduced and were divided into [[watertight]] compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the [[Bridge (nautical)|wheelhouse]] and the [[deckhouse]]. The boats built in the 20th century only had a [[mizzen]] [[sail]], which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a [[crane (machine)|crane]] for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam [[capstan (nautical)|capstan]] on the [[foredeck]] near the mast for hauling [[fishing net|net]]s. These boats had a crew of twelve made up of a [[skipper (boating)|skipper]], driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands.&lt;ref name="grantontrawlers"/&gt;

Steam fishing boats had many advantages. They were usually about {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|longer}} than the sailing vessels so they could carry more nets and catch more fish. This was important, as the market was growing quickly at the beginning of the 20th century. They could travel faster and further and with greater freedom from [[weather]], wind and [[tide]]. Because less time was spent travelling to and from the fishing grounds, more time could be spent fishing. The steam boats also gained the highest prices for their fish, as they could return quickly to harbour with their fresh catch.&lt;ref name="grantontrawlers"/&gt;

Steam trawlers were introduced at [[Grimsby]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] in the 1880s. In 1890 it was estimated that there were 20,000 men on the North Sea. The steam drifter was not used in the herring fishery until 1897. The last sailing fishing trawler was built in 1925 in Grimsby.

===Further development===
[[File:HNoMS Honningsvåg.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Armed trawler {{HNoMS|Honningsvåg}} off [[Iceland]].]]
Trawler designs adapted as the way they were powered changed from sail to coal-fired steam by [[World War I]] to [[Diesel engine|diesel]] and [[turbines]] by the end of [[World War II]].

The first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the [[stern]]. In 1947, the company [[Christian Salvesen]], based in [[Leith]], Scotland, refitted a surplus [[Algerine-class minesweeper|''Algerine''-class minesweeper]] (HMS ''Felicity'') with refrigeration equipment and a factory ship stern ramp, to produce the first combined freezer/stern trawler in 1947.&lt;ref name="hulltrawler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hulltrawler.net/Stern/additions/History.htm|title=HISTORY|access-date=2015-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821172332/http://www.hulltrawler.net/Stern/additions/History.htm|archive-date=2013-08-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first purpose built stern trawler was ''Fairtry'' built in 1953 at [[Aberdeen]]. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons. ''Lord Nelson'' followed in 1961, installed with vertical plate freezers that had been researched and built at the [[Torry Research Station]]. These ships served as a basis for the expansion of 'super trawlers' around the world in the following decades.&lt;ref name="hulltrawler"/&gt;

Since World War II, commercial fishing vessels have been increasingly equipped with electronic aids, such as [[radio navigation aid]]s and [[Fishfinder|fish finders]]. During the [[Cold War]], some countries fitted fishing trawlers with additional electronic gear so they could be used as [[spy ship]]s to monitor the activities of other countries.

==Modern trawlers==
Modern trawlers are usually [[deck (ship)|deck]]ed vessels designed for robustness. Their [[Superstructure (ship)|superstructure]] ([[Bridge (nautical)|wheelhouse]] and accommodation) can be forward, midship or aft. Motorised [[winch]]es, [[electronic navigation]] and [[sonar]] systems are usually installed. Fishing equipment varies in sophistication depending on the size of the vessel and the technology used. Design features for modern fishing trawlers vary substantially, as many national maritime jurisdictions do not impose compulsory vessel inspection standards for smaller commercial fishing vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular 5-86: Voluntary Standards for U.S. Uninspected Commercial Fishing Vessels | publisher =United States Coast Guard |date=August 1986 | url =http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/nvic/pdf/1986/n5-86.pdf | accessdate =2008-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Survey and Vessel Registration | publisher =Maritime Authority of New South Wales | month = | year =2008 | url =http://www.maritime.nsw.gov.au/survey.html | accessdate =2008-08-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080721223842/http://www.maritime.nsw.gov.au/survey.html  |archivedate = 2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanised hauling===
Mechanised hauling devices are used on modern trawlers. Trawl winches, such as Gilson winches, [http://www.fao.org/fishery/equipment/netdrum/en net drums] and other auxiliary winches are installed on deck to control the towing warps (trawling wires) and store them when not in use.

===Electronics===
[[File:Amandine31.jpg|thumb|left|Decca Navigator (Mark 21) and Decca Track Plotter (the forerunners of modern GPS navigation and plotting equipment) on the bridge of this (rather dated) trawler.]]
Modern trawlers make extensive use of contemporary electronics, including navigation and communication equipment, fish detection devices, and equipment to control and monitor gear. Just which equipment will be installed depends on the size and type of the trawler.

Much of this equipment can be controlled from the wheelhouse or bridge. Smaller trawlers have wheelhouses, where electronic equipment for navigation, communications, fish detection and trawl sensors are typically arranged about the skipper's chair. Larger vessels have a bridge, with a command console at the centre and a further co-pilot chair. Modern consoles display all the key information on an integrated display. Less frequently used sensors and monitors may be mounted on the [[deckhead]].&lt;ref name="equipment"&gt;[[FAO]]: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/3385/en Fishing equipment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Navigational instruments, such as an [[autopilot]] and [[GPS]], are used for manoeuvering the vessel in harbour and at sea. Radar can be used, for example, when pair trawling to keep the correct distance between the two vessels. Communication instruments range from basic radio devices to [[Global Maritime Distress Safety System|maritime distress]] systems and [[EPIRB]]s, as well as devices for communicating with the crew. [[Fishfinder|Fish detection]] devices, such as [[echosounder]]s and [[sonar]], are used to locate fish.&lt;ref name="equipment"/&gt;

[[File:Acoustic trawl sensors.jpg|thumb|right|A net [[Measurement|mensurations]] system using acoustic sensors which measure the depth and opening of the trawl net.]]
During trawling operations, a range of trawl sensors may be used to assist with controlling and monitoring gear. These are often referred to as "trawl monitoring systems" or "net mensuration systems".
* net sounders ([[Fisheye lens|trawl eyes]]) give information about the concentration of fish around the opening to the trawl, as well as the clearances around the opening and the bottom of the trawl
* catch sensors give information about the rate at which the [[Bottom trawling#Cod end|cod end]] is filling.
* symmetry sensors give information about the optimal geometry of the trawls.
* tension sensors give information about how much tension is in the warps and sweeps.

[[File:Fish processing hg.jpg|thumb|left|Automatic knives for [[Fillet (cut)|filleting]] fish]]

===Fish storage and processing===
Modern trawlers store the fish they catch in some form of chilled condition. At the least, the fish will be stored in boxes covered with ice or stored with ice in the fish hold. In general, the fish are kept fresh by chilling them with ice or refrigerated sea water, or freezing them in blocks. Also, many trawlers carry out some measure of onboard [[fish processing]], and the larger the vessel, the more likely it is to include fish processing facilities. For example, the catch can undergo some preliminary processing by being passed through sorting and washing devices. At a further stage, the fish might be [[Fish fillet processor|mechanically gutted and filleted]]. Factory trawlers may process [[fish oil]] and [[fish meal]] and may include canning plants.
{{clear}}

===Other design features===
Crew quarters are usually below the wheelhouse and may include [[bunk bed|bunks]], with [[cot side]]s to stop the occupant from rolling out in heavy weather. The need for drying sea clothes is shown by a notice in at least one steam trawler's [[boiler room (ship)|boiler room]] saying "''Do not dry [[oil frock]]s over the boiler''".&lt;ref&gt;In the [[National Fishing Heritage Centre]] at [[Grimsby]]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Trawler types==
Trawlers can be classified by their architecture, the type of fish they catch, the fishing method used, or geographical origin. The classification used below follows the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], who classify trawlers by the gear they use.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]]: Technology Fact Sheets: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/search/en Fishing Vessel type]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outrigger trawlers===
Outrigger trawlers use [[outrigger]]s, or booms, to tow the [[trawl]]. These outriggers are usually fastened to, or at the foot of the mast and extend out over the sides of the vessel during fishing operations. Each side can deploy a twin trawl or a single otter trawl. Outrigger trawlers may have the superstructure forward or aft. Warp winches with [[Capstan (nautical)|capstans]] are installed on the deck to haul the catch.

[[Image:Trawer Hauling Nets.jpg|thumb|right|This small [[shrimp]] trawler uses [[outrigger]]s, with a forward deckhouse and aft working deck.]]
* Outrigger trawlers with a forward superstructure and aft working deck are widely used to target [[shrimp]]. The towing winch is usually located to the rear of the superstructure so warps from the drums feed to [[bollard]]s on the cap rail, and then to towing blocks on the outriggers.
* Outrigger trawlers with aft superstructure and midship working deck are usually beam trawlers (see below). These use large beams to rig the trawls.

Outrigger trawlers use vertical [[Fishfinder|fish finders]] of different kinds, according to their size.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]]: Fishing Vessel type: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/90/en Outrigger trawlers]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=7867 Drawing (FAO)]

===Beam trawlers===
Beam trawlers are a type of outrigger trawler (above), with the superstructure aft and the working deck amidships. They use a very strong outrigger boom on each side, each towing a [[Beam trawling|beam trawl]], with the warps going through blocks at the end of the boom. This arrangement makes it easier to stow and handle the large beams. The outriggers are controlled from a midship A-frame or mast. The towing winch is forward of the superstructure, with the towing warps passed through deck bollards and then out to the towing blocks on the booms.

Beam trawling is used in the [[flatfish]] fisheries in the [[Fishing in the North Sea|North Sea]]. They are equipped with equipment for hauling the net and stowing it aboard. Typically an echosounder and sonar is used for finding fish.

They are medium-sized and high powered vessels, towing gear at speeds up to 8 [[knot (unit)|knot]]s. To avoid the boat capsizing if the trawl snags on the sea floor, winch brakes can be installed, along with safety release systems in the boom stays. The engine power of bottom trawlers is restricted to 2000 HP (1472 KW) for further safety.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]]: Fishing Vessel type: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/120/en Beam trawlers]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=8032 Drawing (FAO)]

[[File:Drawing of a large trawler.png|right]]

===Otter trawlers===
Otter trawlers deploy one or more parallel trawls kept apart horizontally using [[Beam trawling|otter boards]]. These trawls can be towed in midwater or along the bottom. Otter trawlers range in size from sailing canoes to supertrawlers.&lt;ref name="otter"&gt;[[FAO]]: Fishing Vessel type: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/930/en Otter trawlers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Otter trawlers usually have two gallows at the stern with towing blocks. The towing warps run through these, each regulated by its own winch. Medium and large trawlers usually have a stern ramp for hauling the trawl onto the deck. Some trawlers tow twin parallel trawls, using three warps, each warp with its own winch. Some otter trawlers are also outrigger trawlers (above), using outriggers to tow one or two otter trawls from each side.&lt;ref name="otter"/&gt;

Usually otter trawlers have the superstructure forward, though it can be aft or amidship. Gallows are on the stern quarters or there is a stern gantry for operating the otter boards. [[Pelagic]] trawlers can use fish pumps to empty the [[Bottom trawling#Cod end|cod end]].&lt;ref name="otter"/&gt;

===Pair trawlers===
[[Pair trawling|Pair trawlers]] are trawlers which operate together towing a single trawl. They keep the trawl open horizontally by keeping their distance when towing. Otter boards are not used. Pair trawlers operate both midwater and bottom trawls.&lt;ref name="pair"&gt;[[FAO]]: Fishing Vessel type: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/940/en Pair trawlers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The superstructure is forward or midships and the working deck aft. Pelagic trawlers can have fish pumps to empty the codend.&lt;ref name="pair"/&gt;

===Side trawlers===
Side trawlers have the trawl deployed over the side with the trawl warps passing through blocks suspended from a forward gallow and another aft gallow. Usually the superstructure is towards the stern, the fish hold amidships, and the transversal trawl winch forward of the superstructure. A derrick may be a boom rigged to the foremast to help shoot the codend from the side. Until the late sixties, side trawlers were the most common deep sea boat used in North Atlantic fisheries. The 1950s side trawler, ''[[Ross Tiger]]'' is preserved in Grimsby. These trawlers were used for a longer period than other kinds of trawlers, but are now being replaced by stern trawlers. Some side trawlers still in use have been equipped with net drums.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]]: Fishing Vessel type: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/20/en Side trawlers]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=7892 Drawing (FAO)]

===Stern trawlers===
[[Image:togari.jpg|thumb|right|An Icelandic stern trawler.]]
[[File:RV Celtic Explorer, Galway Bay, Ireland.jpg|thumb|right|RV ''Celtic Explorer'', a [[Bottom trawling|bottom trawler]] used for research.]]
Stern trawlers have trawls which are deployed and retrieved from the stern. Larger stern trawlers often have a ramp, though [[pelagic]] and small stern trawlers are often designed without a ramp. Stern trawlers are designed to operate in most weather conditions. They can work alone when [[Midwater trawling|midwater]] or [[bottom trawling]], or two can work together as pair trawlers. The superstructure is forward with an aft working deck. At the stern are gallows or a [[Gantry crane|gantry]] for operating otter boards.&lt;ref name="stern"&gt;[[FAO]]: Fishing Vessel type: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/30/en Stern trawlers]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=7860 Drawing (FAO)]

Any [[fish processing]] usually occurs in deck houses or below deck. A wet fish stern trawler stores the fish in ice or sea water which has been refrigerated. A freezer stern trawler stores the fish in frozen boxes or blocks, and a factory stern trawler processes the catch. A pelagic stern trawler may use fish pumps to empty the codend.&lt;ref name="stern"/&gt;

===Freezer trawlers===
The majority of trawlers operating on the [[high seas]] are freezer trawlers. They have facilities for preserving fish by freezing, allowing them to remain at sea for extended periods of time. They are medium to large size trawlers, with the same general arrangement as stern or side trawlers.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]]: Fishing Vessel type: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/100/en Freezer trawlers]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=7902 Drawing (FAO)]

===Wet fish trawlers===
Wet fish trawlers are trawlers where the fish is kept in the hold in a fresh/wet condition, in boxes covered with ice or with ice in the fish hold. They must operate in areas close to their landing place, and the time such a vessel can spend fishing is limited.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]]: Fishing Vessel type: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/110/en Wet-fish trawlers]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=7905 Drawing (FAO)]

===Trawler/purse seiners===
Trawler/purse seiners are designed so the deck equipment, including an appropriate combination winch, can be rearranged and used for both methods. Blocks, purse davits, trawl gallows and rollers need to be arranged so they control the pursing lines and warp leads and in such a way as to reduce the time required to convert from one arrangement to the other. These vessels are usually classified as trawlers, since the power requirement for trawling is higher.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]]: Fishing Vessel type: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/400/en Trawler-purse seiners]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

===Naval trawlers===
{{main article|Naval trawler}}
During both World Wars some countries created small warships by converting and arming existing trawlers or building new vessels to standard trawler designs. They were typically armed with a small naval gun and sometimes depth charges, and were used for patrolling, escorting other vessels and minesweeping.

==Safety==
Occupational safety is a concern on fishing trawlers. For example, a United States cooperative which operates a fleet of 24 bottom trawlers in Alaskan water reported 25 fatalities over the period 2001–2012. The risk of a fatal injury was 41 times higher than the average for workers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://alaskafisheries.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/amd805yrreview1014.pdf "Five-year review of the effects of Amendment 80"] ''North Pacific Fishery Management Council'', October 2014, pp.45–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oilfield terminology''' refers to the [[jargon]] used by those working in fields within and related to the [[upstream (oil industry)|upstream]] segment of the [[petroleum industry]]. It includes words and phrases describing professions, equipment, and procedures specific to the industry. It may also include [[slang]] terms used by oilfield workers to describe the same.

==Examples==
{{Expand section|date=June 2010}}

*Bell nipple: An enlarged pipe at the top of a [[casing (borehole)|casing]] string that serves as a funnel to guide drilling tools into the top of the [[oil well|well]].
*Big bear: A big bear is a hitch (see hitch) that lasts a minimum of 50 straight days.
*[[Blowout (well drilling)|Blowout]]: A sudden, uncontrolled release of underground pressure from the well.
*Chainhand (also motorman): An experienced laborer capable of maintaining most parts of the rig. The chainhand is in charge of throwing the chain to make up or break down pipe stands during tripping pipe. They are also responsible for maintaining the motors on the drilling rig
*[[Cold vent]]: An area of the ocean floor where hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage occurs, often in the form of a [[brine pool]]. Constitutes a [[biome]] supporting several [[Endemism|endemic]] species. More commonly a "cold seep"
*[[Core sample]]: A cylindrical section of a naturally occurring medium consistent enough to hold a layered structure. Most cores are obtained by drilling into the medium, for example, sediment or rock, with a hollow steel tube called a corer
*CSG (coal seam gas) or CBM ([[coal bed methane]]): Methane that forms in the gaps between coal molecules.&lt;ref name="bg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bg-group.com/Careers/graduates/howtoapply/Pages/JargonBuster.aspx|title=Jargon Buster|publisher=BG Group|accessdate=18 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with csg, an abbreviation for the well casing)
*Derrickman: The third in command after the driller &amp; assistant driller.
*[[Drill string]]: A column, or string, of pipe that transmits [[drilling fluid]] (via the mud pumps) and torque (via the [[Kelly drive]] or [[top drive]]) to the [[drill bit]].
*Driller: The crew supervisor on a drilling [[Oil rig (disambiguation)|rig]], working under the toolpusher.
*Elevator: A hinged mechanism that is closed around the drill pipe, or other drill string components, to facilitate lowering them into or lifting them out of the [[wikt:wellbore|wellbore]].
*Fish: The remnants of a broken drill string, or any object that has been unintentionally dropped down the wellbore. Fishing is the act of using specialized tools to retrieve a fish.
*Floorhand: Laborer responsible for the overall maintenance of the rig.
*Frac job: Slang term for hydraulic fracturing, a process whereby an oil or gas well is stimulated by pumping special fluids into the reservoir, fracturing the formation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=hydraulic%20fracturing&lt;/ref&gt;
*Free point: A common method which involves deploying a wireline to estimate the depth at which the [[drill]] string can get un-stuck during drilling. Free point tools are designed to measure torque and stretch in tubing, casings, and drill pipes and to provide accurate free pipe indication. The highest point at which the drill pipe is "free" or not stuck.  The pipe is then separated and all the pipe that is not stuck is laid down. Fishing tools are then used to attempt to retrieve the stuck pipe.
*Ginzel: Slang term for a worker of the lowest "rank", often a rookie with no oilfield experience whatsoever.
*Hanger: Refers to several different tools. The [[casing hanger]] is the portion of a wellhead assembly which provides support for the casing string when it is lowered into the wellbore. The liner hanger is used to hang casing liners (casing strings that do not reach the surface) from the internal wall of a previous casing string. The [[instrument hanger]] is a downhole tool on which downhole gauges or instruments that are to be temporarily left in the wellbore are attached. The [[tubing hanger]] attaches to the topmost tubing joint in the wellhead to support the tubing string.
*Hitch: Rig employees refer to their work period as a 'hitch.' A common hitch is 20 days on, followed by 10 days off. Typically, two crews will be on and each crew will spend one week working 7am-7pm and the following week 7pm-7am. Or, crews may do a full two weeks of 7am-7pm and then, upon returning after their 10 days off, will work the next two weeks 7pm-7am (the third rig crew being on their 10 days off). Some rigs may operate four crews; these crews typically work 28 days on, followed by 28 days off, and twelve hours shifts.
*[[Horner plot]]: A semi-log plot produced during pressure buildup analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peteng.com/jmm/hnr01.html|title=PRESSURE BUILDUP ANALYSIS - HORNER PLOT|publisher=Peteng Computing|accessdate=18 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Intelligent well: An oil or gas well equipped with monitoring equipment and [[Completion (oil and gas wells)|completion]] components that allow for automatic or remote optimization of production.
*Joint: A length of pipe.
*Kick: An intrusion of pressurized gas into the wellbore that causes drilling fluid to be displaced. It can be the precursor to a blowout.
*Kickoff: A planned deviation from vertical, executed at the bottom of the wellbore.
*Kill: The act of stopping a well from flowing.
*[[Moon pool]]: An air-filled chamber open to the water below.
*Motorman: Responsible for maintaining all equipment on the rig to ensure smooth operation and minimal downtime.
*Mud: Slang term for [[drilling fluid]]. A "mud man" is the drilling fluids technician responsible for formulating the mud, while a "mud logger" checks mud cuttings from the drill bit for traces of rock or oil and gas that provide a picture of conditions downhole.
*Pay: A reservoir or portion of a reservoir containing hydrocarbons that can be economically produced, i.e. it is capable of "paying" an income. Also referred to as "pay sand" or the "pay zone".
*[[Petroleum play]](or "play"): A group of oil prospects that are controlled by the same set of geological circumstances.
*[[Pigging|Pig]]: A device inserted into a pipeline for cleaning purposes. The act of using a pig is called pigging.
*[[Piston corer]]s: Advanced piston corer, extended core barrel systems{{needs clarification}}
*[[Pressure core sampler]]: A tool designed to retrieve a [[sediment]] [[core sample]] from depth under pressure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-odp.tamu.edu/publications/201_IR/chap_03/c3_3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Roughneck]]: A member of an oil rig rigfloor drilling crew.
*Sidetrack: A planned deviation from a previously drilled section of the wellbore. (Sidetrack cement plug, whipstock, open hole sidetrack)
*Subsalt: Refers to [[oil prospect]]s that lie below a [[Salt tectonics|salt layer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=subsalt|title=Oilfield Glossary: Term 'subsalt'|year=2010|publisher=Schlumberger|accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Toolhand: Refers to a third party ([[List of oilfield service companies|down hole services provider]]) service representative or field service supervisor with "tools" to be run and operated in a well.
*[[Toolpusher]]: The boss of a drilling rig, working under the drilling superintendent or the corporation the rig is contracted to.
*Tour: A 'tower' refers to a worker's shift. A drilling crew typically works a 12-hour tour every day until they have finished their hitch.
*Treater: The head supervisor on a hydraulic fracturing crew. Leads operations execution on location in conjunction with feedback from other supervisors, equipment operators, field engineers, and customers.
*V door: An opening at the floor level on one side of the [[derrick]]. It is used to move in equipment and tools such as casing and drill pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mor|first1=Jason|title=Oilfield Jargon|url=http://jobsintheoilpatch.com/oilfield-jargon/|publisher=Jobs in the Oil Patch|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Water Transfer: The act of moving water from one location to another either to support drilling and completion activity when a well is being made or to remove flowback and produced water after the well has been made and oil and gas begin flowing back. 
*Well logging: The practice of making a detailed record (well log) of the [[Formation (stratigraphy)|geologic formations]] penetrated by a borehole. Also known as borehole logging. Wireline logging is the practice of measuring formation properties using electrically powered instruments to infer properties and make decisions about drilling and production operations.
*Worm: An inexperienced oilfield worker who is not yet a "hand".{{needs citation|date=November 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="972">A '''Gorn address''' (Gorn, 1967) is a method of identifying and addressing any [[vertex (graph theory)|node]] within a [[tree (data structure)|tree data structure]]. This notation is often used for identifying nodes in a [[parse tree]] defined by [[phrase structure rules]].

The Gorn address is a sequence of zero or more integers conventionally separated by dots, e.g., ''0'' or ''1.0.1''. 
The root which Gorn calls * can be regarded as the empty sequence. 
And the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th [[tree (data structure)|child]] of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th child has an address &lt;math&gt;i.j&lt;/math&gt;, counting from 0.

It is named after American computer scientist [[Saul Gorn]].

Griffin in 1995.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foss|first=Sonja K.|last2=Griffin|first2=Cindy|date=March 1995|title=Beyond Persuasion: A Proposal for an Invitational Rhetoric|url=|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=62|pages=2-18|doi=10.1080/03637759509376345|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invitational rhetoric is defined as “an invitation to understanding as a means to create a relationship rooted in equality, immanent value, and self-determination.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The theory challenges the traditional definition of rhetoric as persuasion—the effort to change others—because the objective of invitational rhetoric is not to persuade but to gain an understanding of the perspectives of others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emerling Bone|first=Jennifer|last2=Griffin|first2=Cindy L.|last3=Scholz|first3=T.

Invitational rhetoric is part of an effort to formulate alternative conceptions of rhetoric that are not “exploitative and oppressive but that contribute to a more respectful way of being a rhetor in the world.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A major assumption behind invitational rhetoric is that “the communication discipline, through its traditional constructs and theories, participates in this culture of domination,” and invitational rhetoric constitutes an effort to “contribute to the creation of more humane lives” for individuals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Core elements==
Invitational rhetoric is rooted in three feminist principles that “explicitly challenge the positive value the patriarchy accords to changing and thus dominating others”—equality, immanent value, and self-determination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Equality: In contrast to the traditional rhetoric of persuasion, in which the rhetor is seen as superior to the audience, the rhetor and the audience are viewed as equal peers who share authority and expertise and contribute equally to an interaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inviting Transformation: Presentational Speaking for a Changing World|last=Foss|first=Sonja K.|last2=Foss|first2=Karen A.|publisher=Waveland|year=2012|isbn=1-57766-721-2|edition=3|location=Long Grove, IL|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makau|first=Josina M.|date=Spring-Summer 1996|title=Notes on Communication Education and Social Justice|url=|journal=Communication Studies|volume=47|pages=139|doi=10.1080/10510979609368469|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Immanent value: Immanent value means that all individuals have unique, unrepeatable perspectives that should be appreciated for what they contribute to an interaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* Self-determination: Self-determination is the principle that others are competent individuals who should be allowed to make their own decisions about their lives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
Although change is not the objective of invitational rhetoric, change may occur as a result of an invitational interaction. Interacting with others inevitably produces changes of various kinds in interactants, but in the case of invitational rhetoric, both the rhetor and the audience may choose to change their perspectives as a result of the process of sharing perspectives. They do not, however, enter the interaction trying to impose their perspectives on and trying to change one another.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryan|first=Kathleen J.|last2=Natalle|first2=Elizabeth J.|date=2001|title=Fusing Horizons: Standpoint Hermeneutics and Invitational Rhetoric|url=|journal=Rhetoric Society Quarterly|volume=21|pages=71-80|doi=10.1080/02773940109391200|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in invitational rhetoric value diverse perspectives because they recognize that every perspective is partial; as a result, they seek multiple perspectives to gain a more comprehensive understanding of an issue or situation. Invitational rhetors are particularly interested in exploring perspectives that are different from their own because they provide them with new information that enlarges their understanding.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Because they are eager to engage different perspectives and to allow them to affect their own thinking, invitational participants enter an interaction willing to call into question their own perspectives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In contrast to persuasive rhetoric, which involves power-over and an attempt to establish power over others by changing them, in invitational rhetoric, the kind of power involved is power-with.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This type of power is shared among the audience members and the rhetor and is used by all participants together to come to an understanding, to make a decision, or to solve a problem.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Truth or Dare: Encounters with Power, Authority, and Mystery|last=Starhawk|first=|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1990|isbn=0-06-250816-4|location=San Francisco|pages=10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Rhetorical Theories|last=Foss|first=Karen A.|last2=Foss|first2=Sonja K.|last3=Griffin|first3=Cindy L.|publisher=Waveland|year=1999|isbn=1-57766-496-5|location=Long Grove, IL|pages=182-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invitational rhetoric is one of many useful rhetorical options; it is not designed to be used in all situations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is one of five modes of rhetoric—conquest, conversion, benevolent, advisory, and invitational—available to rhetors. In ''conquest rhetoric'', rhetors try to establish their idea as the best among competing positions. ''Conversion rhetoric'' is rhetoric that is designed to change the minds or behaviors of others by convincing them that another way is superior. In ''benevolent rhetoric'', the objective is to help individuals improve their lives and often involves providing useful information to others. ''Advisory rhetoric'' is designed to provide assistance requested by others; it is a response to an implicit or explicit request for information or advice.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=Keith|date=Spring 2014|title=Feminist Challenges to ‘Academic Writing’ Writ Larger: Changing the Argumentative Metaphor from War to Perception to Address the Problem of Argument Culture|url=|journal=Intertexts|volume=18|pages=34|doi=10.1353/itx.2014.0004|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical options in invitational rhetoric==
There are two primary rhetorical options in invitational rhetoric: (1) offering perspectives; and (2) creating external conditions that encourage audience members to share their perspectives with the rhetor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Offering perspectives===
Offering perspectives is the way by which rhetors share their perspectives with audience members, explaining what they know or understand about an issue or idea without advocating for those perspectives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Offering occurs verbally through the use of words to explain a rhetor’s perspective or nonverbally through wearing particular kinds of clothing or displaying symbols that suggest an individual’s identification. Wearing a charity bracelet, for example, suggests that a rhetor is identified with a certain cause or issue. Wearers of the bracelets are not attempting to persuade others to support the cause but are simply offering a perspective so that those who are curious about the bracelet can choose to explore the perspective being offered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Offering perspectives may be difficult to do in hostile situations when other interactants are not interested in hearing a different perspective or when conquest and conversion rhetorics are being used. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In such cases, invitational rhetors may use re-sourcement so that they can offer their perspectives and continue to engage in invitational rhetoric. ''Re-sourcement'' is a term coined by feminist theorist [[Sally Miller Gearhart]] that means drawing energy from a new source—“a source other than the individual or system that provided the initial frame for the issue.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Women’s Spirituality: Essays on the Rise of Spiritual Power within the Feminist Movement|last=Miller Gearhart|first=Sally|publisher=Doubleday|year=1982|isbn=|editor-last=Spretnak|editor-first=Charlene|location=Garden City, NY|pages=95|chapter=Womanpower: Energy Re-Sourcement}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Re-sourcement involves two basic processes. The first is disengaging from the frame of the precipitating message—stepping away from the frame in which the message is being offered and recognizing that the response does not have to be couched in that same frame.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The second process is developing a message that “does not directly argue against or even address the message being offered. It presents a response addressed to a different exigence, need, or problem from the one implicit” in the initial message.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The use of re-sourcement allows rhetors to value both themselves and their audience members and provides a space for more options for interaction in the future because it has not locked participants into an adversarial framework.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An example of re-sourcement is a response suggested by linguist [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] to instances of sexual harassment. She offers what she calls the ''Boring Baroque Response'' to unwanted sexual proposals or sexually suggestive remarks. This strategy involves responding to such messages by telling a long story with many tedious details that is unrelated to and does not address the proposition offered by the instigator of the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Disagree Without Being Disagreeable: Getting Your Point Across with the Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense|last=Haden Elgin|first=Suzette|publisher=John Wiley|year=1997|isbn=0-471-15705-8|location=New York|pages=145-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Creating external conditions===
The second primary rhetorical option in invitational rhetoric is creating external conditions. This option involves creating an environment that encourages audience members to share their perspectives with the rhetor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To accomplish this objective, the invitational rhetor attempts to create three conditions—safety, value, and freedom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Safety: Safety is the creation of “a feeling of security and freedom from danger for the audience.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When safety is created in a rhetorical situation, audience members feel secure both physically and intellectually.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Invitation to Public Speaking|last=Griffin|first=Cindy L.|publisher=Cengage|year=2018|isbn=978-1-305-94808-2|location=Boston|pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; They feel like they can safely share and question ideas and that the rhetor with whom they are sharing their perspectives will respect their ideas and will not degrade or belittle them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

* Value: Value is acknowledgment by the rhetor that the audience members have intrinsic worth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rhetors show that they value audience members when they treat them as unique individuals with worthwhile perspectives. They listen carefully to and seriously consider the perspectives audience members share. As a result, they encourage audience members to contribute in significant ways to the interaction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Freedom: When rhetors give audience members freedom, they do not expect them to make the same choices they have made; they give them the freedom to believe and act as they themselves choose.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Invitational rhetors allow any subjects to be introduced into the interaction and allow all assumptions to be questioned.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Freedom also means that rhetors are not disappointed or angry if audience members choose not to adopt the perspectives they offer. The relationship between rhetor and audience will not be disrupted because of the difference in their perspectives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

({{ISBN|978-1-305-94808-2}})

==Critiques of the theory==
Following are the major critiques that have been offered of the theory of invitational rhetoric. Some of the criticisms of invitational rhetoric concern conceptions of the nature and function of persuasion:
* Persuasion is not violent, as invitational rhetoric suggests that it is.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lozano-Reich|first=Nina M.|last2=Cloud|first2=Dana L.|date=April-June 2009|title=The Uncivil Tongue: Invitational Rhetoric and the Problem of Inequality|url=|journal=Western Journal of Communication|volume=73|pages=221|doi=10.1080/10570310902856105|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics suggest that [[Sonja K. Foss]] and Cindy L. Griffin’s view that rhetoric constitutes violence because it represents an attempt to violate another person’s belief system is a flawed perspective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Condit|first=Celeste Michelle|date=Fall 1997|title=In Praise of Eloquent Diversity: Gender and Rhetoric as Public Persuasion|url=|journal=Women’s Studies in Communication|volume=20|pages=92-98, 101-107|doi=10.1080/07491409.1997.10162405|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics note that those who engage in persuasion are not always trying to impose their will on audience members.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In addition, such a view ignores the nature of audiences. Audience members may refuse to listen to persuasive messages and “have substantial power to resist messages with which they do not agree.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jørgensen|first=Charlotte|date=2007|title=The Relevance of Intention in Argument Evaluation|url=|journal=Argumentatio|volume=21|pages=165-6|doi=10.1007/s10503-007-9044-|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, their individual belief systems are not being violated. These critics believe that “the impulse to persuade others is a constructive and valuable aspect of human symbolic interaction.”&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* Democracy will be undermined if persuasion is disallowed. The intent to change minds and situations is at the root of the deliberative process that takes place in a democracy. If persuasion is not seen as legitimate, democracy cannot be sustained.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* Invitational rhetoric necessarily involves persuasion. Rhetors cannot help but be involved in persuasion when they offer their perspectives because the definition of rhetoric is persuasion; thus, persuasion or influence is an integral part of every symbolic interaction.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some critics use as support for this claim Foss and Griffin’s initial article on invitational rhetoric. Although Foss and Griffin explain in this article that they are attempting to use the features of invitational rhetoric as they describe the theory, some critics suggest that, when they write about invitational rhetoric, they themselves are arguing that others should share their views.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, even Foss and Griffin cannot help but be engaged in persuasion, even when they are describing invitational rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fulkerson|first=Richard|date=Spring 1996|title=Transcending Our Conception of Argument in Light of Feminist Critiques|url=|journal=Argumentation and Advocacy|volume=32|pages=204-5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;
* Invitational rhetoric cannot involve agency because the enactment of agency is only possible through an effort to persuade others. Although ''agency'' has many different definitions, some scholars limit the definition to the effort to change others—unless rhetors are working to get others to change their positions, they are not enacting agency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In such a view, agency does not involve the kinds of activities involved in invitational rhetoric such as understanding, listening, exploring, and sharing. Perspectives are exchanged, but because the rhetors do not take action in the form of attempting to persuade, they do not enact agency.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
Other critiques of the theory of invitational rhetoric are concerned with the nature of rhetoric and rhetorical theory:
* The theory of invitational rhetoric is based on a simplistic, reductive account of rhetorical theory and practice. The rhetorical traditional is not characterized by a patriarchal bias because many definitions of rhetoric focus on interaction rather than coercion.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The interaction of gender with rhetoric has been complicated and varied throughout the rhetorical tradition.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

* The appropriate objective for rhetorical engagement is social change, and it cannot be accomplished through invitational rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Invitational rhetoric valorizes non-confrontational and civil modes of interaction and thus cannot resist injustice and inequality; consequently, invitational rhetoric is “disabling to the oppressed.”&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=Keith|date=2016|title=Beyond ‘Dichotonegative’ Rhetoric: Interpreting Field Reactions to Feminist Critiques of Academic Rhetoric through an Alternate Multivalent Rhetoric|url=|journal=Rhetorica|volume=34|pages=95|doi=10.1525/rh.2016.34.1.78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Invitational rhetoric replaces ''rhetoric'' with ''communication studies'' and thus does a disservice to the field of rhetoric. Foss and Griffin see the terms as synonymous, but they are not.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The term ''rhetoric'' means public persuasion, so invitational rhetoric situates rhetoric in a different realm—the realm of private, non-persuasive interaction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This is not an appropriate realm for rhetoric, and the status of rhetoric is devalued as a result of invitational rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
Other critiques of invitational rhetoric have to do with a variety of other aspects of the theory:
* A key tenet of invitational rhetoric is that all individuals have value; however, not all opinions or views have value. Invitational rhetors see others’ perspectives as significant and as providing important input into an interaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Critics suggest, however, that not all perspectives are equally valuable. Those that cause harm, suffering, and death—such as those of wife abusers and rapists—should not be granted unconditional value and should not be appreciated and included in invitational dialogues.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathison|first=Maureen A.|date=May 1997|title=The Complicity of Essentializing Difference: Complicity as Epistemology: Reinscribing the Historical Categories of ‘Woman’ Through Standpoint Feminism|url=|journal=Communication Theory|volume=7|pages=156|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.1997.tb00146.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* The principles of immanent value and self-determination contradict the dialogic goal of understanding at the heart of invitational rhetoric. Immanent value and self-determination imply a focus on the solitary self and suggest that individuals should close themselves off from other perspectives and privilege their own perspectives.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; But the invitational practices of offering and willingness to yield are dependent upon interrelationships with others and require knowing and interacting with other people.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Mutual enlargement can only happen in interaction, and such interaction contradicts key practices of invitational rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Invitational rhetoric must include all of the ideas espoused by the theorists who influenced the development of invitational rhetoric. Ideas of theorists on which invitational rhetoric is based that were not a part of the theory of invitational rhetoric—such as [[Sally Miller Gearhart]]’s biologism and [[Sonia Johnson]]’s separatism—are imported into and considered part of the theory of invitational rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dow|first=Bonnie J.|date=Spring-Summer 1995|title=Feminism, Difference(s), and Rhetorical Studies|url=|journal=Communication Studies|volume=46|pages=110-11, 113|doi=10.1080/10510979509368442|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critiques of any aspect of theories developed by those who have contributed to invitational rhetoric are applicable to invitational rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;
Two of the common criticisms of invitational rhetoric are misreadings of the theory. They attribute claims to invitational rhetoric that are the opposite of what Sonja Foss and Cindy Griffin explain in their original article on invitational rhetoric:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Invitational rhetoric is not appropriate in every situation. Although Foss and Griffin state that “invitational rhetoric is one of many useful and legitimate rhetorics, including persuasion, in which rhetors will want to be skilled,” some critics see them as calling for the use of invitational rhetoric on all occasions. These critics argue that there are times when persuasion should be used, such as in fighting fascism or trying to talk a friend out of committing suicide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pollock|first=Mark|last2=Artz|first2=Lee|last3=Frey|first3=Lawrence R.|last4=Pearce|first4=W.

* Because invitational rhetoric is a form of rhetoric appropriate only for women, it reifies the gender binary and essentializes women.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bruner|first=M. Lane|date=Spring 1996|title=Producing Identities: Gender Problematization and Feminist Argumentation|url=|journal=Argumentation and Advocacy|volume=32|pages=185, 187|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although Foss and Griffin state that invitational rhetoric is not confined to “a particular population of rhetors” and is “used at various times by some women and some men, some feminists and some non-feminists,” some critics see invitational rhetoric as appropriate for women only.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These critics equate patriarchy with the masculine gender, and because Foss and Griffin label traditional rhetoric as ''patriarchal'', these critics see the alternative—invitational rhetoric—as linked exclusively to the feminine gender.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Pomnik.Jana.Skali-Namyslow.JPG|thumb|upright|Bust of Jan Skala in [[Namysłów]]]]

'''Jan Skala''' (17 June 1889 – 22 January 1945) was a [[Sorbs|Sorbian]] journalist, poet and leading ideologist of the Sorbian national movement. In the interwar period (1918–1945) he was active in the [[Association of National Minorities in Germany]] for the rights of non-German ethnic groups in the [[Germany]].

==Life==
Jan Skala was born on 17 June 1889 in [[Nebelschütz]], Germany. He was son of a quarry worker and a Sorbian costume seamstress. After finishing Bautzen Domschule in 1901 he spent a year in the Catholic Teachers' Preparatory College. He published his Sorbian poems in 1910 and, earlier, some articles in social democratic papers. As a soldier in Russia and in the Balkans in 1916-1918, he deepened his knowledge of Slavic languages. From 1918 to 1919 
Jan was working for the Berlin Versorgungsamt. During the Spartacist riots he worked for the Berlin Security Corps. After he got a position with the Ordnance Department of the Berlin police in Moabit. From 1919 to 1920  Jan was editor of the political newspaper "Serbski Dźenik" in Weißwasser, and a co-founder of the People's Party and Lusatian Sorbian sports association "Serbski Sokoł". In 1921 he shortly worked for Sorbian newspaper "Serbske Nowiny", then moved to Prague where he got a position at the government newspaper "Prager Presse". In January 1924 Jan edited Sorbian newspaper "Serbske Nowiny" and started working for Union of Poles in Berlin. In 1925 to 1927 he participated in the European minority congresses work in Geneva, where he established contacts with progressive politicians and pacifists. He maintained contacts with democratic intellectuals in Czechoslovakia and Poland. 
After the Nazis came to power he was persecuted for his past political activities. In 1936. he was banned as a  journalist and his name was deleted from the list of German writers. In 1937 he left Berlin and moved to Bautzen. On January 21, 1938 Skala was arrested together
with Dr. Cyž and Měrćink; all accused for conspiracy to commit treason. The [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]] in Berlin, on 1 June 1939, convicted  Dr. Cyž and Měrćink of treason. The accused Skala was, for health reasons, released from the prison already on 26 October 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Pech: Auswirkungen des Nationalsozialismus auf die Volksschulen in den „wendischen und gemischtsprachigen Gebieten“ in Sachsen, Lětopis 50 (2003) 2, 3–21, Serbski Institut  Zeitschrift für sorbische Sprache, Geschichte und Kultur, Gesamtband 50, Jahrgang 2003, Heft 2. ISSN 0943-2787&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1939 to 1943 he worked at various Bautzen and Berlin companies. In 1943 he escaped the Berlin bombing and moved to his wife's family in Dziedzice in Upper Silesia . From 1943 to 1945 he worked at "Elektroakustik" in Namysłow, where he supported Polish resistance fighters. On January 22, 1945 he was killed in Dziedzice by a Soviet Army soldier.

==Work==

Jan Skala was a Lusatian Sorb left-leaning leader and patriot, journalist and well-known poet and writer. Skala, as a poet and in his twentieth year, was  writing in German Socialist papers. In his mother-tongue he commenced writing verses in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;The Slavonic Year-book, Volume 19, Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, 1940 p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced into his writings more of the social than the romantic or patriotic notes that had marked the older Lusatian Sorbs writers.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of literature, Volume 2 by Joseph Twadell Shipley, Philosophical Library, 1946, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[World War I|WWI]] he published two books of poetry: "Drobjence" ("The Crumbs") in 1920. and ''Škre'' ("The Sparks") in 1923. "The Crumbs" poems were of strong patriotic tone influenced by another Sorbian poet Čišinski. One of the poems was a call for help and support in his struggle for the Sorbian rights in Germany directed to Jugoslavs. "The Sparks" were love and intimate poems.&lt;ref&gt;Летопис Матице српске - Volume 323 1930  p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;  As a writer Jan is known for some short narratives, the most important of them "Stary Šymko"(“The Old Schimko”) in which he describes how the capitalistic major industries exploited and swindled the Wends who lived in the moors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wendishresearch.org/Hot_Projects_Topics/Translations/wendish_patriots/Jan%20Skala.htm Wendish Patriots]&lt;/ref&gt; An anthology of his poetry was published in 1985 under the ''Jan Skala'' title and edited by J. Łušćanski and K. Lorenc.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Skala, Ludowe nakładnistwo Domowina, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

For his service in the Union of Poles he was seen as a  leader of the Polish minority in Germany. Jan insisted on cultural autonomy of Poles and Sorbs insisting that the existing cultural autonomy was geared to the better-organized and more affluent minorities—the Auslandsdeutschen above all. Further, he claimed that the Nationalities Congress was little more than a cloak for the extension of German influence. On the opposite side, he saw that the inability of poorer minorities to achieve cultural autonomy would lead to their assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;Neighbours Or Enemies?: Germans, the Baltic and Beyond by John Hiden, Martyn Housden Rodopi, 2008 p 47&lt;/ref&gt; During his struggle for the minorities rights in 1930s in the German Reich, in April 1936 he published two articles in "Slavonic and East European Review", the organ of School of Slavic and East European Studies in the University of London, under his Sorabicus pen-name.&lt;ref&gt;Language and Culture of the Lusatian Sorbs Throughout Their History by Martin KasperAkademie-Verlag, 1987 p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kultur besteht, Reich vergeht: Tschechen und Sorben (Wenden) 1914-1945 by Timo Meškank Mensch &amp; Buch, 2000 p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==

In the Polish city [[Namysłów]] a monument was erected to Jan Skala in 1965. In [[Bautzen]], [[Germany]] a street was named after Jan Skala.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1211">'''Johannes Waldemar Karsch''' (May 7, 1881 in [[Dresden]] &amp;ndash; April 14, 1939 in Weixdorf near [[Dresden]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Esperantist]] and a state [[auditor]].

Karsch became an [[Esperantist]] in 1908 and was soon secretary of a local group of the [[German Esperanto Association]] 1910-1914, serving as its president from 1924 on.

After 1913 he was a member of the ''Komitato'' of the [[World Esperanto Association]] (UEA), the Esperanto leadership group later known as the ''Estraro''. In 1928 he became ''komisionano'' and vice-president of the UEA. Then, when [[Eduard Stettler]] was president, Karsch often stood in for Stettler, who was in ill health.

At the 1934 [[Stockholm]] [[World Esperanto Congress]] Karsch was not reelected to the Komitato. In protest, President Stettler resigned. Karsch stayed in contact with the Swiss leadership of the UEA but became inactive (largely because of the Hitler regime) and did not participate in the ''Geneva UEA'' of 1936.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7249">The '''Kaya identity''' is an [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] stating that the total emission level of the [[greenhouse gas]] [[carbon dioxide]] can be expressed as the product of four factors: human [[World population|population]], [[GDP]] [[per capita]], [[energy intensity]] (per unit of GDP), and [[carbon intensity]] (emissions per unit of energy consumed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Yoichi|last1=Kaya|last2=Yokoburi|first2=Keiichi|title=Environment, energy, and economy : strategies for sustainability|date=1997|publisher=United Nations Univ.

The Kaya identity is both simple and tricky, as it can be reduced to only two terms, but it is developed so that the carbon emission calculation becomes easy, as per the available data, or generally in which format the data is available.

== Overview ==
The Kaya identity was developed by Japanese energy economist Yoichi Kaya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rehmeyer|first=Julie|title=Yoichi Kaya's carbon fix formula|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2010/07/start/yoichi-kayas-carbon-fix-formula|publisher=Wired|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the subject of his book ''Environment, Energy, and Economy: strategies for sustainability'' co-authored with Keiichi Yokobori as the output of the ''Conference on Global Environment, Energy, and Economic Development (1993 : Tokyo, Japan).

Kaya identity is expressed in the form: 

:&lt;math&gt;F = P \times \frac{G}{P} \times \frac{E}{G} \times \frac{F}{E}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* ''F'' is global CO2 emissions from human sources
* ''P'' is global population
* ''G'' is world [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]
* ''E'' is global energy consumption&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo469/node/213 | access-date=27 November 2015 |  title=The "Kaya Identity" | department=PennState Department of Meteorology | website=Meteo 469, From Meteorology to Mitigation: Understanding Global Warming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And:
* ''G/P'' is the [[GDP per capita]]
* ''E/G'' is the [[energy intensity]] of the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]
* ''F/E'' is the [[carbon footprint]] of energy

== Use in IPCC reports ==
The Kaya identity plays a core role in the development of future emissions [[scenario]]s in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios]]. The scenarios set out a range of assumed conditions for future development of each of the four inputs. Population growth projections are available independently from demographic research; GDP per capita trends are available from economic statistics and econometrics; similarly for energy intensity and emission levels. The projected carbon emissions can drive [[carbon cycle]] and [[climate models]] to predict future CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration and [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="ipccEmissionScenarios"/&gt;

== Use in other scientific analysis ==
The Kaya identity is reviewed in a 2002 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.122235999|first=P. E.|last=Waggoner|author2=J. H. Ausubel|title=A framework for sustainability science: A renovated IPAT identity|journal=PNAS|volume=99|issue=12|pages=7860–5|year=2002|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/99/12/7860|format=PDF|pmid=12060732|pmc=122985|bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.7860W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global and regional drivers of accelerating CO2 emissions|first=M.R.|last=Raupach|journal=PNAS|volume=104|issue=24|pages=10288–10293|date=May 22, 2007|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/0700609104v1|pmid=17519334|format=PDF|pmc=1876160|doi=10.1073/pnas.0700609104|bibcode=2007PNAS..10410288R|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the Kaya Identity in its analysis of recent trends in carbon emissions, and finds: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;... cessation or reversal of earlier declining trends in the energy intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) (energy/GDP) and the carbon intensity of energy (emissions/energy), coupled with continuing increases in population and per-capita GDP. Nearly constant or slightly increasing trends in the carbon intensity of energy have been recently observed in both developed and developing regions. No region is decarbonizing its energy supply.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Other uses ==
* [[Bill Gates]] used a form of the Identity, without attribution, at a [[TED Talk]] called [https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates/transcript?language=en Innovating to zero!]. Writing in ''[[ThinkProgress]]'', [[Joseph J. Romm]] disputed the validity of Gates' arguments, as well as clarifying the key idea behind the identity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thinkprogress.org/why-bill-gates-math-error-about-climate-change-matters-e220c126b952#.qi47vzids Why Bill Gates’ Math Error About Climate Change Matters] ''[[ThinkProgress]]'' May 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critique ==
The Kaya identity and its applications in climate control policies has been criticized by [[Mario Bunge]].&lt;ref name="Bunge2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bunge|first1=Mario|title=Evaluating Philosophies|date=2012|publisher=Springer Dordrecht Heidelberg New York London|isbn=978-94-007-4407-3|pages=57-59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bunge points out that the Kaya identity is a tautology, because it is nothing but a rewrite of the identity :&lt;math&gt;F = F&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., "Carbon is carbon". Bunge concludes that the Kaya identity is impervious to empirical data, i.e., the Kaya identity cannot be tested empirically and thus cannot be used for predictions. 
In addition, Bunge proposes a tentative formula for the volume of global carbon emission that is not just a simple identity. Bunge suggests means to control climate and finally states "it might also help if economics students were to take Logic 101".&lt;ref name="Bunge2012"/&gt;

'''''Kimbundu''''', or '''North Mbundu''', one of two [[Bantu languages]] called '''Mbundu''' (see [[Umbundu]]), is the second-most-widely spoken Bantu language in [[Angola]]. It is concentrated in the north-west of the country, notably in the [[Luanda Province]], [[Bengo Province]], [[Malanje Province]] and the [[Cuanza Norte Province]]. It is spoken by the [[Northern Mbundu people|Ambundu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ambundu is the short form for Akwa Mbundu and 'Akwa' means 'from', or 'of', or more originally 'originally from' and 'belonging to'. In Kimbundu language the particle Akwa is shortened into simply A, so that instead of Akwa Mbndu it becomes Ambundu; similarly the term Akwa Ngola becomes ANgola, then Angola; Ngola was title for kings in Northern Angolan kingdom in the past, before the Portuguese invasion.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Last words''' or '''final words''' are a person's final articulated words, stated prior to [[death]] or as death approaches. Last words may not necessarily be written down or accurately recorded, and they may not be quoted accurately for a variety of reasons.

==Famous last words==
{{see also|List of last words}}
Famous last words include both the literal utterings; such as the [[sayings of Jesus on the cross]], from Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' "''[[Et tu, Brute?]]''", and the [[Irony|ironical]] sense of words said before a disaster, such as:
* "They couldn't hit an elephant at this distance!" General [[John Sedgwick]] at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]] immediately before being killed by enemy fire.&lt;ref&gt;Foote, Shelby. ''The Civil War: A Narrative. vol. 3, Red River to Appomattox''. New York: Random House, 1974. {{ISBN|0-394-74913-8}}. p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Let all brave Prussians follow me!" Field Marshal [[Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin]] at the [[Battle of Prague (1757)|Battle of Prague]], immediately before getting hit in the head by a cannonball.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, S. (1856). ''The Percy Anecdotes'': Revised edition... New York City, NY: Harper &amp; Brothers. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Don't worry about it ... look, the clip is not even in it." [[Terry Kath]] of the band [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], just before putting a pistol to his temple and pulling the trigger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Forgotten_Heroes_Terry_Kath|title=Forgotten Heroes: Terry Kath|first=Corbin|last=Reiff|journal=Premier Guitar|date=May 11, 2013|accessdate=June 6, 2014|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last words reported to have been uttered by a person revered as a martyr or hero of a religious, nationalist, or revolutionary movement often gain a political significance and are extensively quoted in later literature and/or used as a slogan. However, in many such cases their historical authenticity is doubted.{{cn|date=August 2013}}

[[File:Serpentine lines from William Hogarth's The Analysis of Beauty.jpg|thumbnail|right|Serpentine lines from Hogarth's ''The Analysis of Beauty'']]

'''Line of beauty''' is a term and a theory in [[art]] or [[aesthetics]] used to describe an S-shaped curved line (a [[serpentine shape|serpentine]] line) appearing within an object, as the boundary line of an object, or as a virtual boundary line formed by the composition of several objects. This theory originated with [[William Hogarth]] (18th-century English painter, satirist, and writer), and is an essential part of Hogarth's theory of aesthetics as described in his ''[[Analysis of Beauty]]'' (1753). According to this theory, S-shaped curved lines signify liveliness and activity and excite the attention of the viewer as contrasted with straight lines, parallel lines, or right-angled intersecting lines, which signify stasis, death, or inanimate objects.

In contrast to grand compositional lines, which are regularly found in [[Baroque]] or [[Rococo]] art, the serpentine line is not primarily dictating the whole composition of a canvas. Instead, the line should be understood as being found in parts; a composition is created by employing various kinds of lines in various relations to each other without destroying its simplicity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33318">The '''Lotus International Character Set''' ('''LICS''') is a proprietary [[Single Byte Character Set|single-byte]] [[character encoding]] introduced in 1985 by [[Lotus Development Corporation]]. It is based on the 1983 [[DEC Multinational Character Set]] (MCS) for [[VT220]] terminals. As such, LICS is also similar to two other descendants of MCS, the [[ECMA-94]] character set of 1985&lt;ref name="ECMA_1985_ECMA94_R1"/&gt; and the [[ISO 8859-1]] (Latin-1) character set of 1987.

LICS was first introduced as the character set of [[Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2]] for [[DOS]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="Schemenaur"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Attia_2015_L2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb_1988_123"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lotus_1989_Compatibility"/&gt; It is also utilized by [[Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2.01|2.01]],&lt;ref name="Attia_2015_L2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb_1988_123"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lotus_1989_Compatibility"/&gt; [[Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2.2|2.2]],&lt;ref name="IW_1991_95LX"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matzkin_1991_95LX"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP_1991_95LXUG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lotus_1989_Compatibility"/&gt; [[Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2.3|2.3]] and [[Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2.4|2.4]]&lt;ref name="Lee_1993_100LX"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall_1993_100LX"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PTP_200LX"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamenz_1992_DB"/&gt; as well as by [[Lotus Symphony (DOS)|Symphony]]. It was also utilized in a number of third-party spreadsheet products emulating the file format. LICS was superseded by the [[Lotus Multi-Byte Character Set]] (LMBCS) introduced by [[Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="Kamenz_1992_DB"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Compose key}}Character set==

Codepoints 20&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt; (32) to 7F&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt; (127) are identical to [[ASCII]] (as well as to [[LMBCS (character set)|LMBCS]]).&lt;ref name="Kamenz_1992_DB"/&gt; For some characters the table also lists dedicated Lotus 1-2-3 [[compose key sequence]]s to ease character input beyond the [[Alt Numpad input]] method.

'''Shankar''', (born '''Mani Shankar Mukherjee''', and generally known in English-language literature as ''Sankar'') is a very popular writer in the [[Bengali language]]. He grew up in [[Howrah district]] of [[West Bengal]].

==Personal life==
Shankar is the son of Avaya Mukherjee known as Gouri Mukherjee. Shankar's father died while Shankar was still a teenager, as a result of which Shankar became a clerk to the last British barrister of the Calcutta High Court, Noel Frederick Barwell. At the same time he entered in [[Surendranath College]] (formerly [[Ripon College, Calcutta]]) for study. He worked in various field as typewriter cleaner, private tuitor, Hawker for the livelihood.

Shankar is a widower.

==Literary career==

Noel Barwell introduced Shankar to literature.

After Noel Barwell's sudden death, ''Sankar'', the professional version of his name adopted for the law courts, sought to honor Barwell. "First, I wanted to build a statue. It was not possible. I then wanted to name a road. Even that was not feasible. And then I decided to write a book about him," according to Shankar.

That impetus led to his first novel, about Barwell, that according to some critics is perhaps the most stimulating -- "Kato Ajanare" (So Much Unknown).

At the same time period in 1962, Shankar conceived ''Chowringhee'' on a rainy day at the waterlogged crossing of Central Avenue and Dalhousie - a busy business district in the heart of Kolkata. The novel, set in the opulent hotel he called Shahjahan, was made into a cult movie in 1968.

It is wrongly said that Shankar marketed his literary work to Bengali households with the marketing slogan "A bagful of Shankar (Ek Bag Shankar)" and collections of his books were sold in blue packets through this marketing effort. He never did that. He mentioned it clearly in a 2015 [https://scroll.in/article/733978/bengali-writers-know-that-unless-they-reach-london-nothing-will-happen-sankar interview].

In addition to his literary efforts, Shankar is regarded as a street food expert with two books on this topic.  He also is a marketing professional associated with an Indian industrial house.

'''Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage''' (15 September 1765 – 21 December 1805) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassic]] poet, writing at the beginning of his career under the [[pen name]] '''Elmano Sadino'''.

==Biography==
[[File:Bocage (circa 1785?).png|thumb|left|225px|Bocage at around 20 years old]]
Bocage was born in the Portuguese city of [[Setúbal]], in 1765, to José Luís Soares de Barbosa and Mariana Joaquina Xavier l'Hedois Lustoff du Bocage, of [[France|French]] family.

Bocage began to make verses in infancy, and being somewhat of a [[Child prodigy|prodigy]] grew up to be flattered, self-conscious and unstable. At the age of fourteen, he suddenly left school and joined the 7th Infantry Regiment; but tiring of garrison life at Setúbal after two years, he decided to enter the [[Portuguese navy]]. He proceeded to the Royal Marine Academy in [[Lisbon]] but instead of studying he pursued love adventures. For the next five years he had many love affairs, and his retentive memory and extraordinary talent for improvisation gained him a host of admirers and turned his head.

The Brazilian [[modinha]]s, little rhymed [[poem]]s sung to a [[guitar]] at family parties, were very popular at the time, and Bocage added to his fame by writing a number of these, by his skill in extemporizing verses on a given theme, and by allegorical idyllic pieces, the subjects of which are similar to those of [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]]'s and [[François Boucher|Boucher]]'s pictures. In 1786 he was appointed ''guarda-marinha'' in the [[Portuguese India]] navy, and he reached [[Goa]] by way of the [[Colonial Brazil|colony of Brazil]] in October.  There he came into an ignorant society full of petty intrigue, where his particular talents found no scope to display themselves; the glamour of the East left him unmoved and the [[climate]] brought on a serious illness. In these circumstances he compared the heroic traditions of Portugal in [[Asia]], which had induced him to leave home, with the reality, and wrote his satirical sonnets on ''The Decadence of the Portuguese Empire in Asia'', and those addressed to [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] and D. [[João de Castro]]. The irritation caused by these [[satire]]s, together with rivalries in love affairs, made it advisable for him to leave Goa, and early in 1789 he obtained the post of lieutenant of the infantry company at [[Damão]], [[Portuguese India|India]]; but he promptly deserted and made his way to [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]], where he arrived in July–August. According to a modern tradition much of the "[[Os Lusíadas]]" had been written there, and Bocage probably travelled to China under the influence of another classic Portuguese poet, [[Luís de Camões]], to whose life and misfortunes he loved to compare his own. Though he escaped the penalty of his [[desertion]], he had no resources and lived on friends, whose help enabled him to return to Lisbon in the middle of the following year.
[[Image:Setubal.Bocage.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Statue at Setúbal, Portugal]]

Once back in Portugal he found his old popularity, and resumed his vagabond existence. The age was one of reaction against the [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]]'s  reforms, and the famous intendant of police, [[Pina Manique]], in his determination to keep out [[French Revolution|French revolutionary]] and [[atheism|atheistic propaganda]], forbade the importation of foreign [[classics]] and the discussion of all liberal ideas. Hence the only vehicle of expression left was [[satire]], which Bocage employed with an unsparing hand. His poverty compelled him to eat and sleep with friends like the turbulent friar [[José Agostinho de Macedo]], and he soon fell under suspicion with Manique. He became a member of the New Arcadia, a literary society founded in 1790, under the name of Elmano Sadino, but left it three years later. Though including in its ranks most of the poets of the time, the New Arcadia produced little of real merit, and before long its adherents became enemies and descended to an angry warfare of words. But Bocage's reputation among the general public and with foreign travellers grew year by year. [[William Thomas Beckford|Beckford]], the author of "[[Vathek]]", for instance, describes him as a pale, limber, odd-looking young man, the queerest but perhaps the most original of God's poetical creatures. This strange and versatile character may be said to possess the true wand of enchantment which at the will of its master either animates or petrifies.

In 1797 enemies of Bocage belonging to the New Arcadia delated him to Manique, who on the pretext afforded by some anti-religious verses, the ''Epistola a Marilia'', and by his loose life, arrested him when he was about to flee the country and lodged him in the Limoeiro jail, where he spent his thirty-second birthday. His sufferings induced him to a speedy recantation, and after much importuning of friends, he obtained his transfer in November from the state prison to that of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]], then a mild tribunal, and shortly afterwards recovered his liberty. He returned to his bohemian life and subsisted by writing empty ''Elogios Dramáticos'' for the [[theatre]]s, printing volumes of verses and translating the didactic poems of [[Jacques Delille|Delille]], Castel and others, some second-rate French plays. These resources and the help of brother [[Freemason]]s just enabled him to exist, and a purifying influence came into his life in the shape of a real affection for the two beautiful daughters of D. António Bersane Leite, which drew from him verses of true feeling mixed with regrets for the past. He would have married the younger lady, D. Anna Perpétua (Analia), but excesses had ruined his health.

In 1801 his poetical rivalry with Macedo became more acute and personal, and ended by drawing from Bocage a stinging extempore poem, ''Pena de Talião'', which remains a monument to his powers of invective. In 1804 the illness ([[syphilis]]) from which he suffered increased, and the approach of death inspired some beautiful [[sonnet]]s, including one directed to D. Maria, elder sister of Analia, who visited and consoled him. He became reconciled to his enemies, and died on 21 December 1805 of an [[aneurysm]]. He died in poverty on the eve of the [[Invasion of Portugal (1807)|French invasion]], in a similar way to how Camões' death came just before the occupation of Portugal by the [[Duke of Alva]]'s army. The gulf that divides the life and achievements of these two poets is accounted for less by difference of talent and temperament than by their environment, and illustrates the decline of Portugal in the two centuries that separate 1580 from 1805.

To Beckford, Bocage was a powerful genius, and Link was struck by his nervous expression, harmonious versification and the fire of his poetry. He employed every variety of lyric and made his mark in all. His [[roundel]]s are good, his [[epigram]]s witty, his satires rigorous and searching, his [[ode]]s often full of nobility, but his fame must rest on his [[sonnet]]s, which almost rival those of Camões in power, elevation of thought and tender [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]], though they lack the latter's scholarly refinement of phrasing. So dazzled were contemporary critics by his brilliant and inspired extemporizations that they ignored Bocage's licentiousness, and overlooked the slightness of his creative output and the artificial character of most of his poetry. In 1871 a monument was erected to the poet in the chief square of Setúbal, and the centenary of his death was observed there with much circumstance in 1905.

Perhaps because of the sheer rudeness of some of his verse Bocage is still a genuinely popular figure today, and not only in Setúbal. The subversiveness of his poems has meant that for much of the last 200 years they have not been (officially) available in Portugal: the erotic poetry was first published anonymously towards the end of the 19th century.

&lt;div&gt;
:Thin, blue eyes, tanned face,
:His fair share of feet, middling height,
:Sad of face, the same of figure,
:High nose in the middle, and not small;

:Incapable of staying in just one place,
:More prone to furor than to tenderness;
:Drinking in his pale hands, out of a dark cup,
:From hellish zeal lethal poison;

:Devote incense burner to a thousand deities
:(I mean, a thousand girls) in a single moment,
:Loving the friars only at the altar,

:This is Bocage, in whom some talent shines;
:From himself these truths have come,
:On a day that he felt more dull.

'''Mazanderani''' (مازندرانی), also '''Tabari''' (تبری), is an [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]] of the [[Northwestern Iranian languages|Northwestern branch]], spoken mainly in [[Iran]]'s [[Mazandaran]], [[Tehran province|Tehran]], [[Alborz province|Alborz]], [[Semnan province|Semnan]] and [[Golestan Province|Golestan]] provinces. As a member of the Northwestern branch (the northern branch of Western Iranian), etymologically speaking it is rather closely related to [[Gilaki language|Gilaki]], and more distantly related to [[Persian language|Persian]], which belongs to the Southwestern branch.&lt;ref&gt;Coon, "Iran:Demography and Ethnography" in Encyclopedia of Islam, Volume IV, E.J.

For the most part Mazanderani is mutually unintelligible with [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.501.9468&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Bilingualism in Mazandaran: Peaceful Coexistence with Persian|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name ''Mazanderani'' (and variants of it) derives from the name of the historical region of [[Mazandaran]] (''Mazerun'' in Mazanderani), which was part of former [[Kingdom of Tapuria]].  People traditionally call their language ''Gilaki'', similar as [[Gilak people|Gilaks]] do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=4030997 |title=Māzandarān: Language and People |journal=Iran &amp; the Caucasus |last=Borjian |first=Habib |volume= 8| issue =  2 |date=2004 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |pages=289–291 |doi=10.1163/1573384043076045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gilaki'' consist of two morphemes : ''Gil'' + postfix ''ki''. The name ''Tapuri'' (or ''Tabari'') which was the name of an ancient language of somewhere in former Tapuria, Nowadays becomes prevalent into youth groups instead of Gilaki.
However, Gilan and Mazanderan were part of the same state known as Tapuria which its national language was known as Gilaki.

== History ==
Among the living [[Iranian languages]], Mazanderani has one of the longest written traditions, from the tenth to the fifteenth century. This status was achieved during the long reign of the independent and semi-independent rulers of [[Mazandaran]] in the centuries after the Arab invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Windfuhr, G. L. 1989. New Iranian languages: Overview. In Rüdiger Schmitt, ed., ''Compendium linguarum Iranicarum''. Wiesbaden: L. Reichert. pp.&amp;nbsp;246–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rich literature of this language includes books such as ''[[Marzban Nameh]]'' (later translated into Persian) and the poetry of Amir Pazevari. The use of Mazanderani, however, has been in decline. Its literary and administrative rank was lost to Persian perhaps long before the ultimate integration of [[Mazandaran]] into the national administration in the early seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="M. Borjian 2005"&gt;Borjian, Maryam. 2005.

== Classification ==
The Mazanderani language is closely related to [[Gilaki language|Gilaki]] and the two languages have similar vocabularies. In 1993, according to [[Ethnologue]], there were more than three million native speakers of Mazanderani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=mzn|title=Mazandarani|author=|date=|website=ethnologue.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialects of Mazanderani are Saravi, Amoli, Baboli, Ghaemshahri, Chaloosi, Nuri, Shahsavari, Ghasrani, Shahmirzadi, Damavandi, Firoozkoohi, Astarabadi and Katouli.

Furthermore, an extinct variety, Gorgani, was documented back to the 14th and 15th centuries, from writings of the Horufi movement.

== Grammar ==

Mazanderani is an [[inflected]] and [[genderless language]].&lt;ref&gt;Fakhr-Rohani, Muhammad-Reza. 2004. She means only her 'husband': politeness strategies amongst Mazanderani-speaking rural women.

=== Typology ===
The Gilaki and Mazandarani languages (but not other Iranian languages) share certain [[typology (linguistics)|typological]] features with [[Caucasian languages]] (specifically [[South Caucasian languages]]),&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grolier Incorporated page 294"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D.Stilo pages 137-185"&gt;The Tati language group in the sociolinguistic context of Northwestern Iran and Transcaucasia By D.Stilo, pages 137-185&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the history, ethnic identity, and close relatedness to the [[Caucasus]] region and [[Peoples of the Caucasus]] of the [[Mazandarani people]].

=== Morphology ===
Like other modern [[Iranian languages]] there is no distinction between the dative and accusative cases, and the nominative in the sentence takes almost no indicators but with word order (depending on dialects it may end in a/o/e). Since Mazanderani lacks [[Article (grammar)|articles]], there is no inflection for nouns in the sentence (no modifications for nouns).
For definition, nouns are added with ''e'' at end (''me dətere'' meaning ''The daughter of mine'' while ''me dəter'' means ''my daughter''). The indefinite article for single nouns is ''a-tā'' with ''tā'' for determination of number (''a-tā kijā'' meaning ''a girl'').
There are some remnants from old Mazanderani that female nouns in nominative were ending with ''a'' and male nouns in nominative were ending with ''e'' (as in ''jənā'' meaning ''the woman'' and ''mərdē'' meaning ''the man'') grammatical gender still exists in other present-day close languages such as [[Semnani language|Semnani]], [[Sangesari language|Sangesari]] and [[Zazaki language|Zazaki]].

Mazandarani is rich in [[synonyms]],some such nouns also retaining the gender they possessed in Indo-European times : for instance the words ''Miš, Gal, Gerz'' all have the meaning of [[mouse]], although they are not all of the same gender. While many Indo-Iranian languages use a masculine noun taking such related forms as ''Muš'' or ''Muska'' or ''Mušk'', in Mazandarani the most commonly used name for the mouse is the feminine noun ''Gal''.{{vague|date=May 2015}}

== Influences exerted by Mazanderani ==

=== Modern-day of Iran ===
In Iran, there are some popular companies and products, like Rika (son) or Kija (daughter), which take their name from Mazanderani words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behshahr.ir|title=شهرداری بهشهر|first=شهرداری|last=بهشهر|date=|website=www.behshahr.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In non-Iranian languages ===
There are some Mazanderani loanwords in the [[Turkmen language]].&lt;ref&gt;Nasri-Ashrafi, Jahangir-e (ed.). ''Farhang-e vāžegān-e Tabarī'' [A Dictionary of Tabari]. v. 5, p. 5, Tehran: Eḥyā’-ketāb”: 2002/1381 A.P. A comparative glossary containing lexical units from almost all major urban and rural centers of the region of the three provinces of [[Gilan]], [[Mazandaran]], and [[Golestan Province|Golestan]]. Reviewed in ''Iran and the Caucasus'', 2006, 10(2). Volume 4 contains a Persian-Mazanderani index of approximately 190 pp.&amp;nbsp;Volume 5 includes a grammar of the Mazanderani language.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specimen ==

:Our chickens go onto the nefār and sleep on it. [Once] we noted that the wood of the nefār was all rotten. I told [my son], “Dear child! Here, next to the stable, make me a chicken coop.” In the evening that [my son] was setting the foundation, the father [-in-law] and [his] son came home. As soon as the father and son came home, they would say their prayers, eat something, and then, after the prayers, they would go over there (to the next room); then at four o’clock they would set off.

'''Mende''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|n|d|i}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; (''Mɛnde yia'') is a major language of [[Sierra Leone]], with some speakers in neighboring [[Liberia]]. It is spoken by the [[Mende people]] and by other [[ethnic groups]] as a regional [[lingua franca]] in southern Sierra Leone.

Mende is a [[tonal language]] belonging to the [[Mande languages|Mande]] branch of the [[Niger–Congo language family]]. Early systematic descriptions of Mende were by F. W. Migeod &lt;ref&gt;Migeod, F. W. 1908. ''The Mende language''. London&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kenneth Crosby]].&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, Kenneth. 1944. ''An Introduction to the Study of Mende''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Written forms==

In 1921, [[Kisimi Kamara]] invented a [[syllabary]] for Mende he called [[Kikakui]] ([[File:Ki-ka-ku.png|30px|Kikaku]]).  The script achieved widespread use for a time, but has largely been replaced with an [[alphabet]] based on the [[Latin script]], and the Mende script is considered a "failed script".&lt;ref&gt;Unseth, Peter. 2011. Invention of Scripts in West Africa for Ethnic Revitalization. In ''The Success-Failure Continuum in Language and Ethnic Identity Efforts'', ed. by Joshua A. Fishman and Ofelia García, pp. 23-32. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible was translated into Mende and published in 1959, in Latin script.

The Latin-based alphabet is: '''[[a]]''', '''[[b]]''', '''[[d]]''', '''[[e]]''', '''[[ɛ]]''', '''[[f]]''', '''[[g]]''', '''[[List of Latin-script digraphs#G|gb]]''', '''[[h]]''', '''[[i]]''', '''[[j]]''', '''[[k]]''', '''[[List of Latin-script digraphs#K|kp]]''', '''[[l]]''', '''[[m]]''', '''[[n]]''', '''[[Ny (digraph)|ny]]''', '''[[o]]''', '''[[ɔ]]''', '''[[p]]''', '''[[s]]''', '''[[t]]''', '''[[u]]''', '''[[v]]''', '''[[w]]''', '''[[y]]'''. &lt;ref&gt;[http://aboutworldlanguages.com/mende Coble, Scott. n.d. "Mende." AboutWorldLanguages.com] (accessed 8 October 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mende has seven vowels: '''[[a]]''', '''[[e]]''', '''[[ɛ]]''', '''[[i]]''', '''[[o]]''', '''[[ɔ]]''', '''[[u]]'''. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a1AHAQAAIAAJ A Mende Orthography Workshop: Ministry of Education, Freetown, January 21-25, 1980]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fFK5AAAAIAAJ Pemagbi, Joe. 1991.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1361">'''Military security''' implies the capability of a [[nation-state]] to defend itself, and/or deter military aggression. Alternatively, military security implies the capability of a nation-state to enforce its policy choices by use of military force. The term "military security" is considered synonymous with "[[security]]" in much of its usage. One of the definitions of security given in the ''Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms'', may be considered a definition of "military security":&lt;ref&gt;"Security." ''in'' "Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms", 2001 (As amended through 31 July 2010) op.cited. Pg 477. Accessed 26 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is traditionally, the earliest recognised form of national security.&lt;ref name="Paleri"&gt;{{cite book |title=National Security: Imperatives And Challenges |last=Paleri |first=Prabhakaran |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-0-07-065686-4 |page= |pages=521 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMzcGe0-HQwC |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} The scope of military security has expanded from conventional forms of conflict between [[nation-state]]s to fourth-generation warfare between a state and non-state actors.

[[File:Genísio04.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Street sign, at [[Miranda do Douro|Genísio village]], with the street name in Mirandese and in Portuguese]]
The '''Mirandese language''' (autonym: ''mirandés'' or ''lhéngua mirandesa''; {{lang-pt|mirandês}} or {{lang|pt|língua mirandesa}}) is another glossonym for [[Astur-Leonese languages|Asturleonese]] (like [[Leonese (Asturleonese from León and Zamora)|Leonese]] and [[Asturian (Asturleonese from Asturias)|Asturian]]) that is sparsely spoken in a small area of northeastern [[Portugal]] in the municipalities of [[Miranda do Douro]], [[Mogadouro]] and [[Vimioso]]. The [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] granted it official recognition alongside [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for local matters on 17 September 1998 with the law 7/99 of 29 January 1999.

Mirandese has a distinct [[phonology]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]]. It has its roots in the local [[Vulgar Latin]] spoken in the northern [[Iberian Peninsula]].

Mirandese is a descendant of the Astur-Leonese variety spoken in the [[Kingdom of León]] and has both archaisms and innovations that differentiate it from the modern varieties of Astur-Leonese spoken in Spain. In recognition of these differences, and due to its political isolation from the rest of the Astur-Leonese speaking territory, Mirandese has adopted a different written norm to the one used in Spain for Astur-Leonese. Lexically, it shares a lot of vocabulary with Portuguese.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==History==
In the 19th century, [[José Leite de Vasconcelos]] described it as "the language of the farms, of work, home, and love between the Mirandese". Since 1986–87, it has been taught optionally to students at primary and lower secondary level, and has thus been somewhat recovering.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} By Law 7/99, Mirandese was given official recognition by the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] alongside Portuguese. The law provides for its promotion and allows its usage for local matters in [[Miranda do Douro]].

Today Mirandese retains fewer than 5,000 speakers (but the number can be up to 15,000 if counting second-language speakers) in the villages of the Municipality of [[Miranda do Douro]] and in some eastern villages (such as Vilar Seco and [[Angueira]]; in Caçarelhos, it is considered recently extinct of the Municipality of [[Vimioso]], and some linguistic influence can be observed at other villages of the municipality of Vimioso and the municipalities of [[Mogadouro]], [[Macedo de Cavaleiros]] and [[Bragança, Portugal|Bragança]].

== Variants ==
Three [[variety (linguistics)|variants]] of the Mirandese language exist: Border Mirandese (''Mirandés Raiano''), Central Mirandese (''Mirandés Central'') and Sendinese (''Sendinés''). Most speakers of Mirandese also speak Portuguese.

The main differences between Mirandese in Portugal and the Astur-Leonese languages in [[Spain]] are caused by the dominant languages in each region. Mirandese has been influenced phonetically and in lexicon by Portuguese and the Astur-Leonese languages in [[Spain]] by Spanish (Castilian). All have distinctive orthography that phonetically reflects the respective main national languages. Another difference is that Mirandese and Leonese remain very conservative, while Asturian has undergone a greater amount of change.{{cn|date=June 2009}}

==Phonology==
Some historical developments in Mirandese are the following:
*Mirandese maintains distinct reflexes of all seven medieval [[Ibero-Romance]] sibilants:
::{| class=wikitable style="text-align:center;"
|-
! Ibero-Romance||Mirandese||European&lt;br&gt;Portuguese||North/Central&lt;br&gt;Castilian Spanish
|-
|{{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}}||{{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}}&lt;br&gt;{{angbr|ch}}||{{IPA|/ʃ/}}&lt;br&gt;{{angbr|ch}}||{{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}}&lt;br&gt;{{angbr|ch}}

|-
| {{IPA|/t͡s/ &gt; /s̻/}}||{{IPA|/s̻/}}&lt;br&gt;{{angbr|c}} / {{angbr|ç}}||{{IPA|/s̻/}}&lt;br&gt;{{angbr|c}} / {{angbr|ç}}||{{IPA|/θ/}}&lt;br&gt;{{angbr|c}} / {{angbr|z}}
|-
| {{IPA|/d͡z/ &gt; /z̻/}}||{{IPA|/z̻/}}&lt;br&gt;{{angbr|z}}|| {{IPA|/z̻/}}&lt;br&gt;{{angbr|z}}||{{IPA|/θ/}}&lt;br&gt;{{angbr|c}} / {{angbr|z}}
|-
| {{IPA|/s̺/}} || {{IPA|/s̺/}}&lt;br&gt;{{angbr|s}} / {{angbr|-ss-}}||{{IPA|/s̻/}}&lt;br&gt;{{angbr|s}} / {{angbr|-ss-}}||{{IPA|/s̺/}}&lt;br&gt;{{angbr|s}}
|-
| {{IPA|/z̺/}} || {{IPA|/z̺/}}&lt;br&gt;{{angbr|s}}||{{IPA|/z̻/}}&lt;br&gt;{{angbr|s}}||{{IPA|/s̺/}}&lt;br&gt;{{angbr|s}}
|}
:{{IPA|/s̺/}} and {{IPA|/z̺/}} indicate [[apico-alveolar]] sibilants (as in modern Catalan, northern/central peninsular Spanish and coastal northern European Portuguese), while {{IPA|/s̻/}} and {{IPA|/z̻/}} are dentalized laminal alveolar sibilants (as in most modern Portuguese, French and English). The unrelated [[Basque language]] also maintains a distinction between {{IPA|/s̺/}} and {{IPA|/s̻/}} (Basque has no voiced sibilants), which suggests that the distinction originally was an [[areal feature]] across [[Iberia]].

:Portuguese spelling still distinguishes all seven and is identical to Mirandese spelling in this respect, but in pronunciation, Portuguese has reduced them to four {{IPA|/s, z, ʃ, ʒ/}} except in northern hinterland [[European Portuguese]] dialects, including those of the area that Mirandese is spoken.  Northern/central Peninsular Spanish has also reduced them to four but in quite a different way: {{IPA|/t͡ʃ, θ, s̺, x/}}. [[Andalusian Spanish]] and [[Latin American Spanish]] have further reduced them to three: {{IPA|/t͡ʃ, s̻, h/}}.

*Retention of the initial {{IPA|/f/}} from [[Latin]], like nearly all dialects of Western Romance (the major maverick being Castilian, where {{IPA|/f/}}&gt; {{IPA|/h/}} &gt; ∅).
*As in Portuguese, the [[Latin language|Latin]] initial [[consonant cluster]]s {{IPA|/pl/}}, {{IPA|/kl/}}, {{IPA|/fl/}} evolve into {{IPA|/ʃ/}}.
*[[Proto-Romance]] medial clusters {{smallcaps|-ly-}} and {{smallcaps|-cl-}} became medial {{IPA|/ʎ/}}.
*The cluster /-mb-/ is kept.
*Proto-Romance {{smallcaps|-mn-}} becomes {{IPA|/m/}}: {{smallcaps|lūm'nem}} &gt; ''lume''.
*Falling diphthongs {{IPA|/ei/}}, {{IPA|/ou/}} preserved.
*Final ''-o'' becomes {{IPA|/u/}}.
*Voiced sibilants are still maintained.
*Retention of intervocalic {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}.
*[[Western Romance]] {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ/}} [[diphthong]]ize to {{IPA|/jɛ/}}, {{IPA|/wo/}} (as in [[Italian language|Italian]], and unlike Spanish {{IPA|/je/}}, {{IPA|/we/}}). That happens not only before palatals, as in [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], but also before nasals.
*{{IPA|/l/}} is palatalized word-initially (as in other Astur-Leonese languages and in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]).

==Morphology==
As in Portuguese, Mirandese still uses the following synthetic tenses:
*Synthetic [[pluperfect]] in ''-ra''.
*[[Future subjunctive]] in ''-r(e)''.
*[[Personal infinitive]] in ''-r(e)'', which has the same endings as the future subjunctive but often differs because the personal infinitive always uses the infinitive stem, but the future subjunctive uses the past-tense stem.

==Sample text==
The following is a sample text of the Mirandese language, written by Amadeu Ferreira, and published in the newspaper ''[[Público (Portugal)|Público]]'', on 24 July 2007.

==Recognition==
[[File:Miranda09.jpg|thumb|right|Public sign with the history of the [[Cathedral of Miranda do Douro]], written in Mirandese.]]
Mirandese, given its status as a recognised language in Portugal after Portuguese, has been the subject in recent years of some publicity and attention in other parts of Portugal. A monthly chronicle in Mirandese, by researcher and writer Amadeu Ferreira, appears in the daily Portuguese national newspaper ''[[Público (Portugal)|Público]]''. The first volume of the ''[[Asterix|Adventures of Asterix]]'', named ''Asterix, L Goulés'' (''[[Asterix the Gaul]]''), was published in a Mirandese translation by Amadeu Ferreira in 2005, and sold throughout Portugal. Amadeu Ferreira also translated into Mirandese the epic poem by [[Camões]], ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'' (''Ls Lusíadas''), under his pseudonym Francisco {{sic|hide=y|Niebro}} and published it in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.dn.pt/cartaz/livros/interior/oito-anos-para-traduzir-os-lusiadas-em-lingua-mirandesa-1643606.html?id=1643606 |title=Oito anos para traduzir "Os Lusíadas" em língua mirandesa |date=19 August 2010 |work=Diário de Notícias |access-date=3 July 2018 |agency=[[Lusa News Agency|Lusa]] |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the four [[Gospel]]s of the [[Bible]]'s [[New Testament]] were translated into Mirandese, and in 2013 the entire Bible was translated into the language by Domingos Augusto Ferreira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Galvan, Virginia|url=http://local.pt/portugal/norte/exposicao-biblia-sagrada-traduzida-em-mirandes-em-miranda-do-douro/|title=Exposição "Bíblia Sagrada" traduzida em mirandês em Miranda do Douro|publisher=Local.Pt|language=pt|date=22 March 2013|accessdate=21 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606205252/http://local.pt/portugal/norte/exposicao-biblia-sagrada-traduzida-em-mirandes-em-miranda-do-douro/|archivedate=6 June 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''morphology''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɔr|ˈ|f|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}{{refn|{{Citation|last=Jones|first=Daniel|title=English Pronouncing Dictionary|editors=Peter Roach, James Hartmann and Jane Setter|place=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|orig-year=1917|year=2003|isbn=3-12-539683-2}}}}) is the study of words, how they are formed, and their relationship to other words in the same language.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|chapter=Morphology|first=Stephen R.|last=Anderson|title=Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science|date=n.d.|publisher=Macmillan Reference, Ltd., Yale University|chapter-url=http://cowgill.ling.yale.edu/sra/morphology_ecs.htm|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=What is Morphology?|first1=Mark|last1=Aronoff|first2=Kirsten|last2=Fudeman|date=n.d.|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|work=Morphology and Morphological Analysis|url=http://www.ucd.ie/artspgs/introling/Aronoffmorphology.pdf|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It analyzes the structure of words and parts of words, such as [[stem (linguistics)|stems]], [[root (linguistics)|root words]], [[prefix]]es, and [[suffix]]es. Morphology also looks at [[part of speech|parts of speech]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], and the ways [[Context (language use)|context]] can change a word's pronunciation and meaning. Morphology differs from [[morphological typology]], which is the classification of languages based on their use of words,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|chapter=Morphological Typology|first=Dunstan|last=Brown|title=The Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Typology|editor=Jae Jung Song|orig-year=2010|date=December 2012|pages=487–503|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199281251.013.0023|chapter-url=http://www.surrey.ac.uk/LIS/SMG/DBPapers/morphological%20typology-Brown.pdf|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[lexicology]], which is the study of words and how they make up a language's vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Course in Modern English Lexicology|edition=Revised and Enlarged, Second|first=A.A.|last=Sankin|editors=R.S.

While words, along with [[clitic]]s, are generally accepted as being the smallest units of [[syntax]], in most languages, if not all, many words can be related to other words by rules that collectively describe the [[grammar]] for that language. For example, [[English language|English]] speakers recognize that the words ''dog'' and ''dogs'' are closely related, differentiated only by the [[plural]]ity [[morpheme]] "-s", only found [[Bound morpheme|bound]] to [[noun phrase]]s. Speakers of English, a [[fusional language]], recognize these relations from their innate knowledge of English's rules of [[word formation]]. They infer intuitively that ''dog'' is to ''dogs'' as ''cat'' is to ''cats''; and, in similar fashion, ''dog'' is to ''dog catcher'' as ''dish'' is to ''dishwasher''. By contrast, [[Classical Chinese]] has very little morphology, using almost exclusively unbound morphemes ("free" morphemes) and depending on [[word order]] to convey meaning. (Most words in modern [[Standard Chinese]] ["Mandarin"], however, are [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]] and most [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] are bound.) These are understood as grammars that represent the morphology of the language. The rules understood by a speaker reflect specific patterns or regularities in the way words are formed from smaller units in the language they are using, and how those smaller units interact in speech. In this way, morphology is the branch of linguistics that studies patterns of word formation within and across languages and attempts to formulate rules that model the knowledge of the speakers of those languages.

[[Phonological]] and [[orthography|orthographic]] modifications between a base word and its origin may be partial to [[literacy]] skills. Studies have indicated that the presence of modification in phonology and orthography makes morphologically complex words harder to understand and that the absence of modification between a base word and its origin makes morphologically complex words easier to understand. Morphologically complex words are easier to comprehend when they include a base word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson-Fowler, E.B.|first=&amp; Apel, K.|date=2015|title=Influence of Morphological Awareness on College Students' Literacy Skills: A path Analytic Approach|url=|journal=Journal of Literacy Research|volume=47 |issue=3|pages=405–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polysynthetic language]]s, such as [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]], have words composed of many morphemes. The Chukchi word "təmeyŋəlevtpəγtərkən", for example, meaning "I have a fierce headache", is composed of eight morphemes ''t-ə-meyŋ-ə-levt-pəγt-ə-rkən'' that may be [[Gloss (annotation)|glossed]]. The morphology of such languages allows for each [[consonant]] and [[vowel]] to be understood as [[morphemes]], while the grammar of the language indicates the usage and understanding of each morpheme.

The discipline that deals specifically with the sound changes occurring within morphemes is [[morphophonology]].

==History==

The history of morphological analysis dates back to the [[History of India|ancient Indian]] linguist [[Pāṇini]], who formulated the 3,959 rules of [[Sanskrit]] morphology in the text ''[[Ashtadhyayi|Aṣṭādhyāyī]]'' by using a [[constituency grammar]]. The Greco-Roman grammatical tradition also engaged in morphological analysis. Studies in Arabic morphology, conducted by Marāḥ al-arwāḥ and Aḥmad b. ‘alī Mas‘ūd, date back to at least 1200 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Åkesson 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguistic term "morphology" was coined by [[August Schleicher]] in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;''Für die lere von der wortform wäle ich das wort « morphologie», nach dem vorgange der naturwißenschaften&lt;!--, weil --&gt; [...]'' (Standard High German "Für die Lehre von der Wortform wähle ich das Wort „Morphologie“, nach dem Vorgange der Naturwissenschaften [...]", "For the science of word-formation, I choose the term "morphology"...."). August Schleicher, ''Zur Morphologie der Sprache'', in: ''Mémoires de l'Académie Impériale des Sciences de St.-Pétersbourg, VII° série. Tome I, N° 7'', St. Petersburg, 1859, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental concepts==

===Lexemes and word forms===
The term "word" has no well-defined meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Haspelmath, Martin; Sims, Andrea. Understanding Morphology (Understanding Language) (p. 15). Taylor and Francis. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, two related terms are used in morphology: [[lexeme]] and word-form. Generally, a lexeme is a set of inflected word-forms that is often represented with the [[citation form]] in [[Small caps|small capitals]].&lt;ref&gt;Haspelmath, Martin; Sims, Andrea. Understanding Morphology (Understanding Language) (p. 16). Taylor and Francis. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the lexeme {{Smallcaps|eat}} contains the word-forms ''eat, eats, eaten,'' and ''ate''. ''Eat'' and ''eats'' are thus considered different words-forms belonging to the same lexeme {{Smallcaps|eat}}. ''Eat'' and ''Eater'', on the other hand, are different lexemes, as they refer to two different concepts. Thus, there are three rather different notions of ‘word’.

====Prosodic word vs. morphological word====
Here are examples from other languages of the failure of a single phonological word to coincide with a single morphological word form. In [[Latin]], one way to express the concept of '&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;text-transform:lowercase"&gt;NOUN-PHRASE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;text-transform:lowercase"&gt;NOUN-PHRASE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;' (as in "apples and oranges") is to suffix '-que' to the second noun phrase: "apples oranges-and", as it were. An extreme level of this theoretical quandary posed by some phonological words is provided by the [[Kwak'wala]] language.&lt;ref&gt;Formerly known as [[Kwakiutl]], Kwak'wala belongs to the Northern branch of the Wakashan language family. "Kwakiutl" is still used to refer to the tribe itself, along with other terms.&lt;/ref&gt; In Kwak'wala, as in a great many other languages, meaning relations between nouns, including possession and "semantic case", are formulated by [[affix]]es instead of by independent "words". The three-word English phrase, "with his club", where 'with' identifies its dependent noun phrase as an instrument and 'his' denotes a possession relation, would consist of two words or even just one word in many languages. Unlike most languages, Kwak'wala semantic affixes phonologically attach not to the lexeme they pertain to semantically, but to the preceding lexeme. Consider the following example (in Kwak'wala, sentences begin with what corresponds to an English verb):&lt;ref&gt;Example taken from Foley 1998, using a modified transcription. This phenomenon of Kwak'wala was reported by Jacobsen as cited in van Valin and La Polla 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

kwixʔid-i-da             bəgwanəma&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-χ-a            q'asa-s-is&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;           t'alwagwayu

[[Morpheme]] by morpheme translation:

::kwixʔid-i-da = clubbed-&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;text-transform:lowercase"&gt;PIVOT-DETERMINER&lt;/span&gt;

::bəgwanəma-χ-a = man-&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;text-transform:lowercase"&gt;ACCUSATIVE-DETERMINER&lt;/span&gt;

::q'asa-s-is = otter-&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;text-transform:lowercase"&gt;INSTRUMENTAL-3SG-POSSESSIVE&lt;/span&gt;

::t'alwagwayu = club

:"the man clubbed the otter with his club."

(Notation notes:

# accusative case marks an entity that something is done to.
# determiners are words such as "the", "this", "that".
# the concept of "[[Syntactic pivot|pivot]]" is a theoretical construct that is not relevant to this discussion.)

That is, to the speaker of Kwak'wala, the sentence does not contain the "words" 'him-the-otter' or 'with-his-club' Instead, the [[Descriptive marker|markers]] -''i-da'' (&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;text-transform:lowercase"&gt;PIVOT&lt;/span&gt;-'the'), referring to "man", attaches not to the noun ''bəgwanəma'' ("man") but to the verb; the markers -''χ-a'' (&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;text-transform:lowercase"&gt;ACCUSATIVE&lt;/span&gt;-'the'), referring to ''otter'', attach to ''bəgwanəma'' instead of to ''q'asa'' ('otter'), etc. In other words, a speaker of Kwak'wala does not perceive the sentence to consist of these phonological words:

kwixʔid         i-da-bəgwanəma          χ-a-q'asa        s-is&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-t'alwagwayu

clubbed           PIVOT-the-man&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;         hit-the-otter         with-his&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-club

A central publication on this topic is the recent volume edited by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2007), examining the mismatch between prosodic-phonological and grammatical definitions of "word" in various Amazonian, Australian Aboriginal, Caucasian, Eskimo, Indo-European, Native North American, West African, and sign languages. Apparently, a wide variety of languages make use of the hybrid linguistic unit [[clitic]], possessing the grammatical features of independent words but the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]]-phonological lack of freedom of [[bound morpheme]]s. The intermediate status of clitics poses a considerable challenge to linguistic theory.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Inflection vs. word formation===
Given the notion of a lexeme, it is possible to distinguish two kinds of morphological rules. Some morphological rules relate to different forms of the same lexeme; while other rules relate to different lexemes. Rules of the first kind are [[Inflection|inflectional rules]], while those of the second kind are rules of [[word formation]]. The generation of the English plural ''dogs'' from ''dog'' is an inflectional rule, while compound phrases and words like ''dog catcher'' or ''dishwasher'' are examples of word formation. Informally, word formation rules form "new" words (more accurately, new lexemes), while inflection rules yield variant forms of the "same" word (lexeme).

The distinction between inflection and word formation is not at all clear cut. There are many examples where linguists fail to agree whether a given rule is inflection or word formation. The next section will attempt to clarify this distinction.

Word formation is a process where one combines two complete words, whereas with inflection you can combine a suffix with some verb to change its form to subject of the sentence. For example: in the present indefinite, we use ‘go’ with subject I/we/you/they and plural nouns, whereas for third person singular pronouns (he/she/it) and singular nouns we use ‘goes’. So this ‘-es’ is an inflectional marker and is used to match with its subject. A further difference is that in word formation, the resultant word may differ from its source word’s grammatical category whereas in the process of inflection the word never changes its grammatical category.

===Types of word formation===
{{main|Word formation}}
There is a further distinction between two primary kinds of morphological word formation: [[Morphological derivation|derivation]] and [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]]. Compounding is a process of word formation that involves combining complete word forms into a single compound form. ''Dog catcher'', therefore, is a compound, as both ''dog'' and ''catcher'' are complete word forms in their own right but are subsequently treated as parts of one form. Derivation involves [[affix]]ing bound (i.e. non-independent) forms to existing lexemes, whereby the addition of the affix derives a new lexeme. The word ''independent'', for example, is derived from the word ''dependent'' by using the prefix ''in-'', while ''dependent'' itself is derived from the verb ''depend''. There is also word formation in the processes of clipping in which a portion of a word is removed to create a new one, blending in which two parts of different words are blended into one, acronyms in which each letter of the new word represents a specific word in the representation i.e. NATO for North Atlantic Treaty Organization, borrowing in which words from one language are taken and used in another, and finally coinage in which a new word is created to represent a new object or concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam041/2003048479.pdf|title=Word Formation in English|last=Plag|first=Ingo|date=2003|website=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam041/2003048479.pdf|publisher=Cambridge|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paradigms and morphosyntax===
{{Linguistic typology topics}}
A linguistic [[Inflection|paradigm]] is the complete set of related word forms associated with a given lexeme. The familiar examples of paradigms are the [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]] of verbs and the [[declension]]s of nouns. Also, arranging the word forms of a lexeme into tables, by classifying them according to shared inflectional categories such as [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical gender|gender]] or [[Grammatical case|case]], organizes such. For example, the [[English personal pronouns|personal pronouns in English]] can be organized into tables, using the categories of [[Grammatical person|person]] (first, second, third); number (singular vs. plural); gender (masculine, feminine, neuter); and case (nominative, oblique, genitive).

The inflectional categories used to group word forms into paradigms cannot be chosen arbitrarily; they must be categories that are relevant to stating the [[Syntax|syntactic rules]] of the language. Person and number are categories that can be used to define paradigms in English, because English has [[Agreement (linguistics)|grammatical agreement]] rules that require the verb in a sentence to appear in an inflectional form that matches the person and number of the subject. Therefore, the syntactic rules of English care about the difference between ''dog'' and ''dogs'', because the choice between these two forms determines which form of the verb is used. However, no syntactic rule for the difference between ''dog'' and ''dog catcher'', or ''dependent'' and ''independent''. The first two are nouns and the second two are adjectives.

An important difference between inflection and word formation is that inflected word forms of lexemes are organized into paradigms that are defined by the requirements of syntactic rules, and there are no corresponding syntactic rules for word formation.  The relationship between syntax and morphology is called "morphosyntax" and concerns itself with inflection and paradigms, not with word formation or compounding.

===Allomorphy===
Above, morphological rules are described as [[Analogy|analogies]] between word forms: ''dog'' is to ''dogs'' as ''cat'' is to ''cats'' and as ''dish'' is to ''dishes''. In this case, the analogy applies both to the form of the words and to their meaning: in each pair, the first word means "one of X", while the second "two or more of X", and the difference is always the plural form ''-s'' (or ''-es'') affixed to the second word, signaling the key distinction between singular and plural entities.

One of the largest sources of complexity in morphology is that this one-to-one correspondence between meaning and form scarcely applies to every case in the language. In English, there are word form pairs like ''ox/oxen'', ''goose/geese'', and ''sheep/sheep'', where the difference between the singular and the plural is signaled in a way that departs from the regular pattern, or is not signaled at all. Even cases regarded as regular, such as ''-s'', are not so simple; the ''-s'' in ''dogs'' is not pronounced the same way as the ''-s'' in ''cats''; and, in plurals such as ''dishes'', a vowel is added before the ''-s''. These cases, where the same distinction is effected by alternative forms of a "word",  constitute [[allomorph]]y.

Phonological rules constrain which sounds can appear next to each other in a language, and morphological rules, when applied blindly, would often violate phonological rules, by resulting in sound sequences that are prohibited in the language in question. For example, to form the plural of ''dish'' by simply appending an ''-s'' to the end of the word would result in the form {{IPA|*[dɪʃs]}}, which is not permitted by the [[phonotactics]] of English. In order to "rescue" the word, a vowel sound is inserted between the root and the plural marker, and {{IPA|[dɪʃɪz]}} results. Similar rules apply to the pronunciation of the ''-s'' in ''dogs'' and ''cats'': it depends on the quality (voiced vs. unvoiced) of the final preceding [[phoneme]].

===Lexical morphology===
Lexical morphology is the branch of morphology that deals with the [[lexicon]], which, morphologically conceived, is the collection of [[lexeme]]s in a language. As such, it concerns itself primarily with word formation: derivation and compounding.

==Models==

There are three principal approaches to morphology and each tries to capture the distinctions above in different ways:
* Morpheme-based morphology, which makes use of an item-and-arrangement approach.
* Lexeme-based morphology, which normally makes use of an item-and-process approach.
* Word-based morphology, which normally makes use of a word-and-paradigm approach.
While the associations indicated between the concepts in each item in that list are very strong, they are not absolute.

===Morpheme-based morphology===
[[File:Independently morphology tree.png|thumb|Morpheme-based morphology tree of the word "independently"]]
In morpheme-based morphology, word forms are analyzed as arrangements of [[morpheme]]s. A morpheme is defined as the minimal meaningful unit of a language. In a word such as ''independently'', the morphemes are said to be ''in-'', ''depend'', ''-ent'', and ''ly''; ''depend'' is the [[root (linguistics)|root]] and the other morphemes are, in this case, derivational affixes.&lt;ref&gt;The existence of words like ''appendix'' and ''pending'' in English does not mean that the English word ''depend'' is analyzed into a derivational prefix ''de-'' and a root ''pend''. While all those were indeed once related to each other by morphological rules, that was only the case in Latin, not in English. English borrowed such words from French and Latin but not the morphological rules that allowed Latin speakers to combine ''de-'' and the verb ''pendere'' 'to hang' into the derivative ''dependere''.&lt;/ref&gt; In words such as ''dogs'', ''dog'' is the root and the ''-s'' is an inflectional morpheme. In its simplest and most naïve form, this way of analyzing word forms, called "item-and-arrangement", treats words as if they were made of morphemes put after each other ("[[concatenation|concatenated]]") like beads on a string. More recent and sophisticated approaches, such as [[distributed morphology]], seek to maintain the idea of the morpheme while accommodating non-concatenated, analogical, and other processes that have proven problematic for item-and-arrangement theories and similar approaches.

Morpheme-based morphology presumes three basic axioms:&lt;ref&gt;See Beard 1995 for an overview and references.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jan Baudouin de Courtenay|Baudoin]]’s "single morpheme" hypothesis: Roots and affixes have the same status as morphemes.
* [[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfield]]’s "sign base" morpheme hypothesis: As morphemes, they are dualistic signs, since they have both (phonological) form and meaning.
* Bloomfield’s "lexical morpheme" hypothesis: morphemes, affixes and roots alike are stored in the lexicon.

Morpheme-based morphology comes in two flavours, one Bloomfieldian and one [[Charles F. Hockett|Hockettian]].&lt;ref&gt;See Bloomfield 1933 and Hockett 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; For Bloomfield, the morpheme was the minimal form with meaning, but did not have meaning itself.{{clarify|date=December 2013}} For Hockett, morphemes are "meaning elements", not "form elements". For him, there is a morpheme plural using allomorphs such as ''-s'', ''-en'' and ''-ren''. Within much morpheme-based morphological theory, the two views are mixed in unsystematic ways so a writer may refer to "the morpheme plural" and "the morpheme ''-s''" in the same sentence.

===Lexeme-based morphology===
Lexeme-based morphology usually takes what is called an item-and-process approach. Instead of analyzing a word form as a set of morphemes arranged in sequence, a word form is said to be the result of applying rules that alter a word-form or stem in order to produce a new one. An inflectional rule takes a stem, changes it as is required by the rule, and outputs a word form; a derivational rule takes a stem, changes it as per its own requirements, and outputs a derived stem; a compounding rule takes word forms, and similarly outputs a compound stem.

===Word-based morphology===
Word-based morphology is (usually) a word-and-paradigm approach. The theory takes paradigms as a central notion. Instead of stating rules to combine morphemes into word forms or to generate word forms from stems, word-based morphology states generalizations that hold between the forms of inflectional paradigms. The major point behind this approach is that many such generalizations are hard to state with either of the other approaches. Word-and-paradigm approaches are also well-suited to capturing purely morphological phenomena, such as [[Morpheme|morphomes]]. Examples to show the effectiveness of word-based approaches are usually drawn from [[fusional language]]s, where a given "piece" of a word, which a morpheme-based theory would call an inflectional morpheme, corresponds to a combination of grammatical categories, for example, "third-person plural". Morpheme-based theories usually have no problems with this situation since one says that a given morpheme has two categories. Item-and-process theories, on the other hand, often break down in cases like these because they all too often assume that there will be two separate rules here, one for third person, and the other for plural, but the distinction between them turns out to be artificial. The approaches treat these as whole words that are related to each other by analogical rules. Words can be categorized based on the pattern they fit into. This applies both to existing words and to new ones. Application of a pattern different from the one that has been used historically can give rise to a new word, such as ''older'' replacing ''elder'' (where ''older'' follows the normal pattern of [[adjective|adjectival]] [[superlative]]s) and ''cows'' replacing ''kine'' (where ''cows'' fits the regular pattern of plural formation).

==Morphological typology==
{{main|Morphological typology}}

In the 19th century, philologists devised a now classic classification of languages according to their morphology. Some languages are [[Isolating language|isolating]], and have little to no morphology; others are [[Agglutinating language|agglutinative]] whose words tend to have lots of easily separable morphemes; others yet are inflectional or [[Fusional language|fusional]] because their inflectional morphemes are "fused" together. That leads to one bound morpheme conveying multiple pieces of information. A standard example of an isolating language is [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. An agglutinative language is [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] are prototypical inflectional or fusional languages.

It is clear that this classification is not at all clearcut, and many languages (Latin and Greek among them) do not neatly fit any one of these types, and some fit in more than one way. A continuum of complex morphology of language may be adopted.

The three models of morphology stem from attempts to analyze languages that more or less match different categories in this typology. The item-and-arrangement approach fits very naturally with agglutinative languages. The item-and-process and word-and-paradigm approaches usually address fusional languages.

As there is very little fusion involved in word formation, classical typology mostly applies to inflectional morphology. Depending on the preferred way of expressing non-inflectional notions, languages may be classified as synthetic (using word formation) or analytic (using syntactic phrases).

==Examples==
Pingelapese is a Micronesian language spoken on the Pingelap atoll and on two of the eastern Caroline Islands, called the high island of Pohnpei. Similar to other languages, words in Pingelapese can take different forms to add to or even change its meaning. Verbal suffixes are morphemes added at the end of a word to change its form. Prefixes are those that are added at the front. For example, the Pingelapese suffix –''kin'' means ‘with’ or 'at.’ It is added at the end of a verb.

''ius'' = to use --&gt; ''ius-kin'' = to use with

''mwahu'' = to be good --&gt; ''mwahu-kin'' = to be good at

''sa-'' is an example of a verbal prefix. It is added to the beginning of a word and means ‘not.’

''pwung'' = to be correct --&gt; ''sa-pwung'' = to be incorrect

There are also directional suffixes that when added to the root word gives the listener a better idea of where the subject is headed. The verb ''alu'' means to walk. A directional suffix can be used to give more detail.

''-da'' = ‘up’ --&gt; ''aluh-da'' = to walk up

''-d''i = ‘down’ --&gt; ''aluh-di'' = to walk down

''-eng'' = ‘away from speaker and listener’ --&gt; ''aluh-eng'' = to walk away

Directional suffixes are not limited to motion verbs. When added to non-motion verbs, their meanings are a figurative one. The following table gives some examples of directional suffixes and their possible meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Preverbal Particles in Pingelapese|last=Hattori|first=Ryoko|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nogai''' ({{IPAc-en|n|oʊ|ˈ|g|aɪ}}, also '''Nogay''' or '''Nogai Tatar''') is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language spoken in southwestern [[European Russia]]. Three distinct dialects are recognized: 
* '''Karanogay''' or '''Qara-Nogai''' (literally "Black Nogai"; "Northern Nogai"), spoken in [[Republic of Dagestan|Dagestan]],
* '''Central Nogai''' or '''Nogai Proper''', in [[Stavropol]], and
*'''[[Ak Nogai|Aqnogai]]''' (White or Western Nogai), by the [[Kuban River]], its tributaries in [[Karachay–Cherkessia]], and in the [[Mineralnye Vody District]]. Qara-Nogai and Nogai Proper are very close linguistically, whereas Aqnogai is more different.

Nogai is generally classified into the Kipchak–Nogai branch of [[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]] [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]. The latter also includes [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], [[Karakalpak language|Karakalpak]] in [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] in [[Kazakhstan]], and [[Kyrgyz language|Kirgiz]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]].

==History==

The [[Nogais|Nogai]], descended from the peoples of the [[Golden Horde]], take their name and that of their language from the grandson of [[Genghis Khan]], [[Nogai Khan]], who ruled the nomadic people west of the [[Danube]] toward the end of the 13th century. They then settled along the [[Black Sea]] coast of present-day [[Ukraine]].

Originally, the Nogai alphabet was based on the [[Arabic script]]. In 1928, a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] was introduced. It was devised by the Nogai academic [[Abdulkhamid Dzhanibekov]] (Djanibek), following principles adopted for all [[Turkic languages]].

In 1938, a transition to the [[Russian alphabet]] began. The [[orthography]] based on the Latin alphabet had allegedly been an impediment to learning Russian.

The expulsion of the Nogai from Ukraine in the nineteenth century separated Nogai speakers into several geographically isolated groups. Some went to [[Turkey]] and [[Romania]], while others stayed within the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Empire]], settling in northern Dagestan and neighbouring areas of [[Chechnya]] and [[Stavropol Kray]].

Being a Turkic language, the Nogai language disappeared very rapidly in Turkey. Today it is mostly spoken by the older generation. In the [[Soviet Union]] the language of instruction in schools was Russian and the number of speakers declined there also. Recent estimates place the total number of Nogai speakers at about 80,000.

In 1973, two small Nogai-language newspapers were being published, one in Karachay–Cherkessia and another in the Dagestan Autonomous SSR (''Ленин йолы''), but because of poor communications these papers did not reach Nogai villages.

Nogai is now part of the school curriculum from the 1st to the 10th year in the Nogai District of Dagestan. It is also taught at the Karachayevo-Cherkess Pedagogical School and the national branch of the Pedagogical Institute.

==Alphabet==

===Arabic alphabet===
Before 1928 the alphabet used for the Nogai language was based on the [[Arabic script]]. It included all the letters of the Arabic plus the additional symbols for the specific sounds of the Nogai. This alphabet was not widespread.

&lt;span style="font-size:200%;line-height:150%"&gt;{{script/Arabic|ڮ ۇ ۋ پ ںُ چ ژ  گ}}&lt;/span&gt;

===Latin alphabet===
In 1928 the Nogai alphabet based on Latin as part of the Soviet-wide [[Romanization|Latinization]] campaign. A. Sh. Dzhanibekov, a&lt;!---Ачикулакской средней школы---&gt; high school teacher was the author of this alphabet.

The letters '''C c, I̡ ı̡, F f, H h, X x, Ƶ ƶ''' were added in 1931, and the letter '''S̷ s̷''' in 1933. In 1936 the letters '''Ç ç, Ә ә, H h, I̡ ı̡''' were excluded from the alphabet.

===Cyrillic alphabet===
The Nogai alphabet based on [[Cyrillic]] was created in 1938. It included all of the [[Russian alphabet]] letters except '''Ё ё'''), and also the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] '''Гъ гъ, Къ къ, Нъ нъ'''. The digraphs '''Оь оь, Уь уь''' were added in the same year. In 1944 the digraphs '''Гъ гъ, Къ къ''' were excluded from the alphabet. The last reform of the Nogai alphabet took place in 1950, when it attained the current form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4324">[[File:PuertoPrincipeProvisionalStamp.jpg|right|thumb|1899 Cuban provisional stamp printed in the town of Puerto Príncipe. Note that ''cents'' is misspelled ''eents'']]
Linn's World Stamp Almanac&lt;ref&gt;Donna O'Keefe Houseman, editor; ''Linn's World Stamp Almanac, Millennium (6th) Edition''. {{ISBN|978-0-940403-85-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines a '''provisional stamp''' as "a postage stamp issued for temporary use to meet postal demands until new or regular stocks of stamps can be obtained."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linns.com/insights/stamp-collecting-basics/2003/april/lines-of-stamp-classifications-have-blurred.html  Rick Miller, "Lines of stamp classifications have blurred"] 29 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The issuance of provisional stamps might be occasioned by a change in name or government, by occupation of foreign territory, by a change in postal rates, by a change of currency, or by the need to provide stamps that are in short supply. An interesting example of issuing provisional stamps occurred during the [[Spanish–American War]] when supplies of stamps were low and the U.S. had occupation forces in Cuba. They are known as the [[Postage stamps and postal history of Cuba|"Puerto Principe" provisional]] stamps of 1898–1899. Over 40 different combinations of [[overprint]]ed valuations and underlying Spanish Cuban stamps were produced under the auspices of the military forces over a three-week period from December 19, 1898 to January 11, 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Edifil; ''Catálogo Especializado de Sellos de Cuba, Tomo I (1855–1958)'', 2nd Ed.; Madrid, 2002 (in Spanish). {{ISBN|84-95019-08-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were replaced by another provisional set produced by overprinting U.S. stamps in the United States for Cuba. This second set of provisional stamps was sold for about eight months before the U.S. could print Cuban stamps. The U.S. civilian provisionals also included overprinted [[Postal stationery|postal cards]] and [[stamped envelope]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, George T.; ''The Postal Stationery of the Possessions and Administrative Areas of the United States of America''; United Postal Stationery Society, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-9800112-3-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Provisional stamps are usually made by [[overprint]]ing, surcharging and occasionally by [[Bisects and splits (philately)|bisecting]] pre-existing stamps.

==Postmasters' provisionals==
[[File:United States postmasters provisional St Louis 1845-46 10 cent postage stamp.jpg|thumb|Provisional stamp issued in St. Louis, 1845]]
A subcategory, '''Postmasters' provisionals''', of particular importance in United States philately, comprises stamps that were issued by local postmasters in nations that had not yet begun to issue stamps for countrywide use. Between 1845, when the United States standardardized national postage rates, and 1847, when the post office issued its first stamps, postmasters' provisionals were introduced in eleven American cities, including New York, Providence, Rhode Island and St. Louis, Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspcs.org/postmasters-provisionals/|title=Postmasters' Provisionals|publisher=U.S. Philatelic Classics Society |date= |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these stamps (particularly from smaller cities such as Millbury, Massachusetts) are notable for their great rarity,&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{cite book |last=Snee |first=Charles (editor) |title=Scott Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps and Covers 2013 |publisher=Scott Publishing Co |year=2012 |OCLC=781677423 |isbn=0894874756|pages=1–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or for their relative crudity of design.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Postmasters' provisionals also played a significant role in early history of the [[Confederate States of America]]. Many localities began furnishing them after U.S. mail service ceased delivering Confederate mail in June 1861; for it was only in October that Confederate stamps for nationwide use first appeared.

'''Rokhl Auerbakh''' ({{lang-he-n|רחל אוירבך}}, also spelled '''Rokhl Oyerbakh''' and '''Rachel Auerbach''') (18 December 1903 – 31 May 1976)&lt;ref name=jwa&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/Auerbakh-Rokhl|title=Rokhl Auerbakh|first=Carrie|last=Friedman-Cohen|date=1 March 2009|work=Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Jewish Women's Archive]]|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jewish]] writer, essayist, historian, [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] scholar, and [[List of Holocaust survivors|Holocaust survivor]]. She wrote prolifically in both [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], focusing on prewar Jewish cultural life and postwar Holocaust documentation and witness testimonies. She was one of the three surviving members of the covert [[Ringelblum Archive|Oyneg Shabes]] group led by [[Emanuel Ringelblum]] that chronicled daily life in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], and she initiated the excavation of the group's buried manuscripts after the war. In [[Israel]], she directed the Department for the Collection of Witness Testimony at [[Yad Vashem]] from 1954 to 1968.

==Early life and education==
Rokhl Eiga Auerbakh was born in [[Lanivtsi|Łanowce]], [[Podolia]]&lt;ref name=yivo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Oyerbakh_Rokhl|title=Oyerbakh, Rokhl|first=Samuel|last=Kassow|authorlink=Samuel Kassow|work=[[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]]|year=2010|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Khanina Auerbakh and his wife Mania (née Kimelman).&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt; At a young age, she and her family moved to [[Lviv]].&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt; She had one brother who died in 1935; her parents also died before World War II.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt;

Auerbakh attended the [[Adam Mickewicz]] Gymnasium in [[Lviv]] and completed her graduate studies at the [[Lviv University#Jan Kazimierz University (1919–39)|Jan Kazimierz University]] in the fields of philosophy and general history.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt;

==Interwar years==
Auerbakh began her writing career in 1925 as a journalist for ''Chwila'', a Polish [[Zionism|Zionist]] daily newspaper published in Lviv. In the second half of the decade she worked for the ''Morgen'' Yiddish daily newspaper as an editor and writer. Between 1929 and 1930 she edited a literary column in a weekly published by the [[Poalei Zion]] movement.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt; She was an editor of ''Tsushtayer'', a Yiddish literary journal, and coeditor and contributor to ''Yidish'', another Galician journal that emphasized the cultural movement.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt;

Relocating to [[Warsaw]] in 1933, she was a frequent contributor to the leading Yiddish and Polish newspapers and literary journals of the day.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt; She wrote on "Polish and Yiddish literature, education, psychology, folklore, art, linguistics and theater", and paid special attention to Yiddish and Polish women writers and authors.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt;

==War years==
During the German [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupation of Poland]], Auerbakh was interned in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]]. She overtly worked as the director of a [[soup kitchen]] and covertly as a member of the secret [[Ringelblum Archive|Oyneg Shabes]] group organized by [[Emanuel Ringelblum]], which recruited historians, writers, rabbis, and social workers to chronicle daily life in the Ghetto.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt;&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt;&lt;ref name=boaz&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/2916940/Rachel_Auerbuch_Yad_Vashem_and_Israeli_Holocaust_Memory|title=Rachel Auerbach, Yad Vashem, and Israeli Holocaust Memory|first=Boaz|last=Cohen|authorlink=Boaz Cohen|publisher=academia.edu|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auerbakh kept a diary in Polish and also wrote a vivid account titled "Two Years in the Ghetto", which described the pervasive hunger that she witnessed.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt;&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt; She interviewed and transcribed the testimony of Abraham Krzepicki, an escapee from the [[Treblinka extermination camp]], between December 28, 1942 and March 7, 1943.&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt;&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.yadvashem.org/sites/default/files/yv_magazine75_2.pdf|title='Sobbing at Their Own Funeral'|first=Dr. David|last=Silberklang|pages=12–13|journal=Yad Vashem Jerusalem Quarterly Magazine|volume=75|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auerbakh escaped from the Warsaw Ghetto on March 9, 1943 and worked on the Aryan side as a Polish secretary, aided by her "non-Jewish" appearance and fluency in the German language.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt; By night, she continued recording her historical notes of Jews at that time. At the request of an underground Jewish committee, she wrote "[[Bereavement in Judaism#Yizkor|Yizkor]]", a lengthy essay about the summer 1942 Warsaw Ghetto deportation, and another piece recounting the lives of "Jewish writers, artists and cultural activists in Warsaw", both of which were widely circulated underground.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt;{{sfn|Roskies|1999|pages=24–27}} "Yizkor", the only one of her works to be translated into English, featured themes that would appear frequently in the books she wrote after the war, including "the importance of the culture that was destroyed; the humanity and specific identity of the victims; the responsibility to remember; and the difficulty of finding appropriate words to convey the enormity of the loss".&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt; At one point Auerbakh was spotted writing at night by candlelight and gave her manuscripts for safekeeping to Polish [[Righteous Among the Nations]] [[Jan and Antonina Żabiński|Dr. Jan Żabiński]], director of the [[Warsaw Zoo]]; he buried them on the zoo grounds and she retrieved them after the war.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yadvashem.org/righteous/stories/zabinski|title= Jan and Antonina Zabinski|year=2016|publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At war's end, Auerbakh was one of only three surviving members of the Oyneg Shabes group.&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt; She initiated the search for and excavation of the documents buried by the group in the Warsaw Ghetto, which yielded the [[Ringelblum Archive]].&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt;&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/13272068|title=From Beyond the Grave|date=12 March 2009|accessdate=18 December 2016|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar==
Auerbakh dedicated the rest of her life to collecting witness testimony and writing about the people she had known before and during the [[The Holocaust in Poland|Holocaust in Poland]].&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt; From 1945 to 1950 she worked at the [[Jewish Historical Institute]] in Warsaw collecting witness testimonies, mainly from survivors of [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]].&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt; In November 1945 she was a member of a fact-finding mission to Treblinka conducted by the Polish State Committee for the Investigation of Nazi War Crimes on Polish Soil, and published a report and analysis of the functioning of the camp and those who were murdered.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt; She co-founded the Central Jewish Historical Commission in [[Łódź]] and served as literary and history editor for its publication ''Dos Naye Leben''.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt;&lt;ref name=ency&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2587501599.html|title=Auerbakh, Rokhl|first=Carrie|last=Friedman-Cohen|edition=2nd|work=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]|date=1 January 2007|accessdate=16 December 2016|subscription=yes|via=[[HighBeam Research|HighBeam]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She created guidelines for collecting witness testimony and began publishing testimonies in Yiddish and Polish.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt;

In 1950 she and several colleagues quit the Commission when Jewish communists began to exert more influence over its activities.&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt; She [[Aliyah|immigrated]] to Israel, settling in [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt;

On March 1, 1954, Auerbakh was named director of [[Yad Vashem]]'s new Department for the Collection of Witness Testimony, which was based in Tel Aviv where most Holocaust survivors had settled.&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt; In this role, she interviewed local survivors and began compiling a database of survivors who lived elsewhere.&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt; She introduced new methodologies for collecting witness testimonies and trained Holocaust archivists and researchers.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/200914/yizkor-1943|title=Book Reviews: Yizkor, 1943|first=Rachel|last=Auerbach|date=5 May 2016|accessdate=16 December 2016|work=[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While she encouraged survivors to write their memoirs, she was critical of the popular novels being written about the Holocaust in the genre of [[historical fiction]].&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt; She continued to write articles and books about Jewish cultural life before and during the Holocaust in her native Polish and Yiddish, finding it difficult to attain fluency in Hebrew.&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt;

Auerbakh accorded great importance to witness testimonies as a Holocaust research tool for three reasons. First, the available Holocaust documentation largely originated from Nazi sources, which "told only the story of the murderers, but not of the murdered". Witness testimony allowed researchers to understand Jewish lives during the Holocaust, not just the mechanics of Jewish deaths.&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt; Second, she saw these testimonies as therapeutic for the survivors, saying: "I am convinced that the confessions, called giving testimony, from the era of the Holocaust have a calming and healing inﬂuence and help free them [the survivors] from the horrors".&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt; Third, she believed it was crucial to build documentation that could be used in future criminal trials of Nazis. Auerbakh later gathered witness testimonies for the 1961 trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]] and personally testified at that trial regarding spiritual life in the Warsaw Ghetto.&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt;

By 1965 Auerbakh's department had amassed a collection of 3,000 witness testimonies in 15 languages.&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt; However, she and other "survivor historians" experienced ongoing tension with the Yad Vashem directorate, headed by [[Ben-Zion Dinur]], who viewed Holocaust research as also embracing "the war against anti-Semitism", "persecution of the Jews", "research on the Jewish question", and "hatred of Israel".&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt; Tensions between Auerbakh and Dinur reached a head in 1957–1958, but Auerbakh emerged with her department intact and a large measure of public opinion on the side of the survivor historians. However, in 1968, when she turned 65, the Yad Vashem directorate demanded that she retire.&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt;

==Final years and legacy==
She was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] in 1972 and was hospitalized for a recurrence of the disease in December 1975.&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt; She died on May 31, 1976 at the age of 72.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt;

Auerbakh willed her estate to Yad Vashem.&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt; The Rokhl Auerbach Personal Archives (Inventory no. P–16) at Yad Vashem contain "personal, published and unpublished manuscripts in Polish and Yiddish, preparatory material concerning her testimony at the Nuremberg and Eichmann Trials, declarations, correspondence, recordings, photographs, film, scripts (in Polish, Yiddish and English), and administrative documents concerning the Department for Collecting Witness Testimony at Yad Vashem".&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt;

==Personal life==
Auerbakh never married.&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt; She lived with Polish Jewish poet [[Itzik Manger]] in prewar Warsaw and was the inspiration for some of his poems.&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt;{{sfn|Roskies|Wolf|2013|p=20}} She rescued Manger's archive and returned it to him in [[London]] after the war.{{sfn|Klingenstein|1998|page=352}}

'''Silt'e''' (ስልጥኘ {{IPA|[siltʼiɲɲə]}} or የስልጤ አፍ {{IPA|[jəsiltʼe af]}}) is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language spoken in central [[Ethiopia]]. One of the [[Ethiopian Semitic languages]], its speakers are the [[Silt'e people|Silt'e]], who mainly inhabit the [[Silte Zone]] in the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region]]. Speakers of the Wolane dialect mainly inhabit the [[Kokir Gedebano]] district of [[Gurage Zone]], as well as the neighbouring [[Seden Sodo]] district of [[Oromia]]. Some have also settled in urban areas in other parts of the country, especially [[Addis Ababa]].

==Speakers and dialects==
Dialects of the Silt'e language include: [[Azernet-Berbere]], [[Silti]], [[Wuriro]], [[Ulbareg]] and [[Wolane]]. There are about 940,000 native Silt'e speakers (2007 census); 125,000 speakers of Wolane.

==Sounds and orthography==

=== Consonants and vowels ===
Silt'e has a fairly typical set of consonants for an [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopian Semitic]] language. There are the usual [[ejective consonant]]s, alongside plain voiceless and voiced consonants and all of the consonants, except {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/ʔ/}}, can be [[gemination|geminated]], that is, lengthened. However, Silt'e vowels differ considerably from the typical set of seven vowels in languages such as [[Amharic]], [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]] and [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]]. Silt'e has the set of five short and five long vowels that are typical of the nearby Eastern Cushitic languages, which may be the origin of the Silt'e system. There is considerable [[allophone|allophonic]] variation within the short vowels, especially for ''a''; the most frequent allophone of {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|[ə]}}, is shown in the chart. All of the short vowels may be [[Vowel#Phonation|devoiced]] preceding a pause.

The charts below show the phonemes of Silt'e. For the representation of Silt'e consonants, this article uses a modification of a system that is common (though not universal), among linguists who work on Ethiopian Semitic languages, but differs somewhat from the conventions of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]. When the IPA symbol is different, it is indicated in brackets in the charts. The symbols {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/ʔ/}} (glottal stop) appear in parentheses, because they play only a marginal role in the system, {{IPA|/p/}}, because it appears in only a few words in the Azarnat dialect and {{IPA|/ʔ/}}, because (as in [[Amharic]]), it is often omitted.

===Orthography===
Since at least the 1980s, Silt'e has been written in the [[Ge'ez alphabet]] (Ethiopic), originally developed for the now-extinct [[Ge'ez language]] and most familiar today in its use for [[Amharic]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]].

This orthographic system makes distinctions among only seven vowels. Some of the short-long distinctions in Silt'e are therefore not marked. In practice, this probably does not interfere with comprehension because there are relatively few [[minimal pair]]s based on vowel length.
In written Silt'e, the seven Ge'ez vowels are mapped onto the ten Silt'e vowels as follows:
* ''ä'' → ''a'': አለፈ ''alafa'' 'he passed'
* ''u'' → ''u'', ''uu'': ሙት ''mut'' 'death', ''muut'' 'thing'
* ''i'' →
** ''ii'': ኢን ''iin'' 'eye'
** word-final ''i'': መሪ ''mari'' 'friend'
** ''i'' ending a noun [[word stem|stem]]: መሪከ ''marika'' 'his friend'
** impersonal perfect verb ''i'' suffix: ባሊ ''baali'' 'people said'; በባሊም ''babaalim'' 'even if people said'
* ''a'' → ''aa'': ጋራሽ ''gaaraaš'' 'your (f.) house'
* ''e'' → ''e'', ''ee'': ኤፌ ''eeffe'' 'he covered'
* ''ǝ'' →
** ''i'' (except as above): እንግር ''ingir'' 'foot'
** consonant not followed by a vowel: አስሮሽት ''asroošt'' 'twelve'
* ''o'' → ''o'', ''oo'': ቆጬ ''k'oč'e'' 'tortoise', ''k'ooč'e'' 'he cut'

==Language vitality==
Meshesha Make Jobo reports that the use of the Silt'e language is being replaced by the use of Amharic by some speakers for some domains. He points to large political and social factors, many from the national level. He also points out smaller, local factors, such as the lack of creatively genres.&lt;ref&gt;Meshesha Make Jobo. 2016.

The term "'''''sinthome'''''" ({{IPA-fr|sɛ̃tom|lang}}) was introduced by [[Jacques Lacan]] in his seminar ''Le sinthome'' (1975–76).  According to Lacan, ''sinthome'' is the Latin way (1495 Rabelais, IV,63&lt;ref&gt;The term used by Rabelais is not sinthome but symptomates : « Amis, respondit Pantagruel, à tous les doubtes et questions par vous proposées compete une seule solution, et à tous telz symptomates et accidents une seule medicine. » (François Rabelais, ''Les Cinq Livres'', La Pochothèque, 1994, p. 1193)&lt;/ref&gt;) of spelling the Greek origin of the French word ''symptôme'', meaning [[symptom]]. The seminar is a continuing elaboration of his [[topology]], extending the previous seminar's focus (''RSI'') on the [[Borromean rings|Borromean Knot]] and an exploration of the writings of [[James Joyce]]. Lacan redefines the psychoanalytic symptom in terms of his topology of the subject.

In "Psychoanalysis and its Teachings" (''Écrits'') Lacan views the symptom as inscribed in a writing process, not as [[ciphered message]] which was the traditional notion. In his seminar "L'angoisse" (1962–63) he states that the symptom does not call for interpretation: in itself it is not a call to the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] but a pure [[jouissance]] addressed to no one. This is a shift from the linguistic definition of the symptom — as a [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]] — to his assertion that "the symptom can only be defined as the way in which each subject enjoys (''jouit'') the unconscious in so far as the unconscious determines the subject." He goes from conceiving the symptom as a message which can be deciphered by reference to the unconscious structured like a language to seeing it as the trace of the particular modality of the subject's ''jouissance''.

This shift from linguistics to topology constitutes the status of the ''sinthome'' as unanalyzable. The seminar extends the theory of the Borromean knot, which in ''RSI'' (Real, Symbolic, Imaginary) had been proposed as the structure of the subject, by adding the ''sinthome'' as the fourth ring to the triad already mentioned, tying together a knot which constantly threatens to come undone. Since meaning (''sens'') is already figured within the knot, at the intersection of the Symbolic and the Imaginary, it follows that the function of the ''sinthome'' — knotting together [[the Real]], [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]] and [[the Symbolic]] — is beyond meaning.

'''Skepi''' is an extinct [[Dutch-based creole languages|Dutch-based creole language]] of [[Guyana]], spoken in the region of [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]]. It was not [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with [[Berbice Creole Dutch]], also spoken in Guyana. This language has been classified as extinct since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Scholastic Book of Lists (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
By the twentieth century, the existence of a Dutch creole language in the former Essequibo colony was largely forgotten about, and the language only gained the interest of linguists after the Guyanan linguist Ian E. Robertson, who had already brought [[Berbice Creole Dutch]] to the attention of the scientific community, also found people on the Essequibo River who remembered a Dutch creole language. In contrast to Berbice Creole Dutch, however, Skepi—which name derives from ''Yskepi'', the first Dutch name of the Essequibo River{{sfn|Robertson|1989|p=3}}—was not actively spoken anymore during Robertson's fieldwork. The sample sentences and a [[Swadesh list]] compiled by Robertson were thus based on the memories of non-native speakers of the language still spoken by their parents or grandparents.

After Robertson published his material, some older sources emerged. In the memoir of reverend Thomas Youd, who was a missionary in [[British Guiana]], it is asserted that British missionaries learnt Skepi in the 1830s and that they used this language in their church services.{{sfn|Veness|1869}} According to this memoir, these missionaries also produced a dictionary of the language,{{sfn|Veness|1869|p=85}} which since has been lost, however.

In 2013, a letter written by Essequibo planter Wernard van Vloten emerged which contained a small fragment in Skepi Dutch. This letter, which was dated 26 September 1780, is believed to be the oldest source of the Skepi language.&lt;ref name="StemmenVanAfrika"&gt;{{cite news |last=Van den Berg |first=Margot |date=6 July 2013 |title=Skepi Nederlands: Is dit geen moye taal? |url=http://stemmenvanafrika.nl/skepi-nederlands-is-dit-geen-moye-taal/ |access-date=2017-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Universiteit Leiden"&gt;{{cite news |last=Van der Wal |first=Marijke |date=17 December 2013 |title=Brief van de maand december 2013 |url=http://www.hum.leidenuniv.nl/onderzoek/brieven-als-buit/over/brief-van-de-maand-december-2013.html |access-date=2017-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sample texts ==
Since the language was already extinct when Ian Robertson first investigated the Dutch creoles in Guyana in 1975, much of Skepi is known only through the memory the descendants of native speakers have of the language their forefathers spoke. The following three sample sentences appeared in a Zeelandic newspaper in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Evenhuis, M. (1997) "[http://people.zeelandnet.nl/evenhuis/belbel2.htm Zeeuwse creooltalen sterven een stille dood]", ''Provinciale Zeeuwse Courant''. 1 December.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6368">In [[linguistics]], '''subcategorization''' denotes the ability/necessity for [[lexical item]]s (usually verbs) to require/allow the presence and types of the syntactic [[verb argument|argument]]s with which they co-occur.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (1965) is a prominent early source on the concept of subcategorization.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of subcategorization is similar to the notion of [[valency (linguistics)|valency]],&lt;ref&gt;The valency concept in linguistics is originally from Tesnière (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; although the two concepts (subcategorization and valency) stem from different traditions in the study of syntax and grammar.

==Examples==
While subcategorization is a concept that can apply to almost any type of lexical item, it is usually discussed with respect to verbs. Verbs that take just one argument are classified as intransitive, while verbs with two and three arguments are classified as transitive and ditransitive, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;See Tallerman (2011:39-41) for a discussion of subcategorization in terms of intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive verbs.&lt;/ref&gt; The following sentences are employed to illustrate the concept of subcategorization:

::Luke worked.
::Indiana Jones ate chilled monkey brain.
::Tom waited for us.

The verb ''worked/work'' is intransitive and thus subcategorizes for a single argument (here ''Luke''), which is the subject; therefore its subcategorization frame contains just a subject argument. The verb ''ate/eat'' is transitive, so it subcategorizes for two arguments (here ''Indiana Jones'' and ''chilled monkey brain''), a subject and an optional object, which means that its subcategorization frame contains two arguments. And the verb ''waited/wait'' subcategorizes for two arguments as well, although the second of these is an optional prepositional argument associated with the preposition ''for''. In this regard, we see that the subcategorization frame of verbs can contain specific words. Subcategorization frames are sometimes schematized in the following manner:

::work [NP __ ]
::eat [NP __ (NP)]
::wait [NP __ (''for''NP)]

These examples demonstrate that subcategorization frames are specifications of the number and types of arguments of a word (usually a verb), and they are believed to be listed as [[lexicon|lexical]] information (that is, they are thought of as part of a speaker's knowledge of the word in the vocabulary of the language). Dozens of distinct subcategorization frames are needed to accommodate the full combinatory potential of the verbs of any given language. Finally, subcategorization frames are associated most closely with verbs, although the concept can also be applied to other word categories.

Subcategorization frames are essential parts of a number of [[phrase structure grammar]]s, e.g. [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]], [[Lexical Functional Grammar]], and [[Minimalism (linguistics)|Minimalism]].

==The status of subjects==
The subcategorization notion is similar to the notion of [[valency (linguistics)|valency]], although subcategorization originates with [[phrase structure grammar]]s in the [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] tradition,&lt;ref&gt;See Chomsky (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; whereas valency originates with [[Lucien Tesnière]] of the [[dependency grammar]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;See Tesnière (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; The primary difference between the two concepts concerns the status of the subject. As it was originally conceived of, subcategorization did not include the subject, that is, a verb subcategorized for its [[complement (linguistics)|complement]](s) (=object and oblique arguments) but not for its subject.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of theories that exclude the subject from subcategorization frames, see Burton-Roberts (1886:73ff.), Horrocks (1986:34f.), Haegeman (1994:40-42, 45 note 10), Bennet (1995:43ff.), Green and Morgan (1996:68 note 6), Fromkin et al. (2000:230).&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern theories now include the subject in the subcategorization frame, however.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of theories that include the subject in the subcategorization frame, see Kaplan and Bresnan (1982:210-212), Cattell (198428ff.), Pollard and Sag (1994:23), Culicover (1997:17), Carnie (2007:50ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; Valency, in contrast, included the subject from the start.&lt;ref&gt;Tesnière (1959/69:109, chapter 51, paragraph 13) emphasized that from a syntactic point of view, the subject is a complement just like the object.&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, subcategorization is moving in the direction of valency, since many phrase structure grammars now see verbs subcategorizing for their subject as well as for their object(s).

'''Sumerian''' &lt;span class="noexcerpt"&gt;({{lang-sux|{{cuneiform|sux|𒅴𒂠}} {{transl|sux|EME.G̃IR&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} "[[exonym and endonym|native tongue]]")&lt;/span&gt; is the language of ancient [[Sumer]] and a [[language isolate]] that was spoken in [[Mesopotamia]] (modern-day [[Iraq]]). During the 3rd millennium BC, an intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the [[Sumer]]ians and the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-speaking [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].&lt;ref name=deutscher2007/&gt; The influence of Sumerian and the [[East Semitic]] language [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] on each other is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a substantial scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.&lt;ref name=deutscher2007/&gt; This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium BC as a ''[[Sprachbund]]''.&lt;ref name=deutscher2007/&gt;

Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language around 2000 BC (the exact dating being subject to debate),&lt;ref name=woods/&gt; but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Akkadian speaking Mesopotamian states such as [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]] until the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name=oates79/&gt;&lt;ref name=grayson80/&gt; Thereafter it was likely forgotten until the 19th century, when [[Assyriologists]] began [[Decipherment|deciphering]] the [[cuneiform]] inscriptions and excavated tablets left by these speakers.

==Stages==
The history of written Sumerian can be divided into several periods:
*Archaic Sumerian&amp;nbsp;– 31st–26th century BC
*Old or Classical Sumerian&amp;nbsp;– 26th–23rd century BC
*Neo-Sumerian&amp;nbsp;– 23rd–21st century BC
*Late Sumerian&amp;nbsp;– 20th–18th century BC
*Post-Sumerian&amp;nbsp;– after 1700 BC

[[File:Sumerian - Protoliterate Tablet - Walters 41219 - View A.jpg|thumb|This proto-literate tablet (c. 3100&amp;nbsp;– 2900 BC) records the transfer of a piece of land ([[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]])]]
Archaic Sumerian is the earliest stage of inscriptions with linguistic content, beginning with the [[Jemdet Nasr period|Jemdet Nasr]] (Uruk III) period from about the 31st to 30th centuries BC. It succeeds the [[Cuneiform script#Proto-literate period|proto-literate period]], which spans roughly the 35th to 30th centuries.

Some versions of the chronology may omit the Late Sumerian phase and regard all texts written after 2000 BC as Post-Sumerian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history-world.org/sumerian_language.htm Sumerian Language]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Post-Sumerian" is meant to refer to the time when the language was already extinct and preserved by [[Babylonia]]ns and [[Assyria]]ns only as a [[liturgical language|liturgical]] and [[classical language]] for religious, artistic and scholarly purposes. The extinction has traditionally been dated approximately to the end of the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]], the last predominantly Sumerian state in Mesopotamia, about 2000 BC. However, that date is very approximate, as many scholars have contended that Sumerian was already dead or dying as early as around 2100 BC, by the beginning of the Ur III period,&lt;ref name=woods/&gt;&lt;ref name=michal06/&gt; and others believe that Sumerian persisted, as a spoken language, in a small part of Southern Mesopotamia ([[Nippur]] and its surroundings) until as late as 1700 BC.&lt;ref name=woods/&gt; Whatever the status of spoken Sumerian between 2000 and 1700 BC, it is from then that a particularly large quantity of literary texts and bilingual Sumerian-Akkadian [[lexical lists]] survive, especially from the scribal school of Nippur. They and the particularly-intensive official and literary use of the language in Akkadian-speaking states during the same time call for a distinction between the Late Sumerian and the Post-Sumerian periods.

==Dialects==
The standard variety of Sumerian was ''eme-g̃ir''. A notable variety or sociolect was ''eme-sal'' (𒅴𒊩 EME.SAL),
possibly to be interpreted as "fine tongue" or "high-pitched voice" (Rubio (2007) p. 1369). Other terms for dialects or registers were
''eme-galam'' "high tongue", ''eme-si-sa'' "straight tongue", ''eme-te-na'' "oblique[?] tongue", etc.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvain Auroux, ''History of the Language Sciences'' vol. 1 (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=JqxnjTKaQvQC&amp;pg=PA2 p. 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Eme-sal'' is used exclusively by female characters in some literary texts (that may be compared to the female languages or language varieties that exist or have existed in some cultures, such as among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchis]] and the [[Island Caribs]]). In addition, it is dominant in certain genres of cult songs. The special features of ''eme-sal'' are mostly phonological (for example, ''m'' is often used instead of ''g̃'' (i.e. {{IPA|[ŋ]}}) as in ''me'' as opposed to the ''g̃e&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;'', "I"), but words different from the standard language are also used (''ga-ša-an'' rather than standard ''nin'', "lady").&lt;ref&gt;Rubio (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=gaktTQ8vq28C&amp;pg=PA1370#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 1370].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammatical overview==


Sumerian is an [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]], [[split ergativity|split ergative]], and [[subject-object-verb]] language. It behaves as a [[nominative–accusative language]] in the 1st and 2nd persons of the incomplete [[Grammatical tense|tense]]-[[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], but as [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]] in most other forms of the [[indicative mood]]. 

Sumerian nouns are organized in two [[grammatical genders]] based on [[animacy]]: animate and inanimate. Animate nouns include humans, gods, and in some instances the word for "statue". [[Suffix]]es mark a noun's [[Grammatical case|case]]: [[absolutive]] (-Ø), [[ergative case|ergative]] (''-e''), [[dative]]/[[allative]] (''-r(a)'' animate, ''-e'' inanimate, "to, for"), [[genitive]] (''-(a)k'' "of"), [[locative]] (''-a'', only inanimate, "in, at"), [[comitative]] (''-da'' "with"), [[equative case|equative]] (''-gin'' "as, like"), [[directive case|directive]]/[[adverbial]] (''-š(e)'' "toward"), [[ablative]] (''-ta'', only inanimate, "from"). The naming and number of cases vary according to differing analyses of Sumerian linguistics. Noun phrases are right branching with adjectives and modifiers following nouns.

Sumerian verbs have a [[Grammatical tense|tense]]-[[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] [[Grammatical aspect#Aspect vs. tense|complex]], contrasting complete and incomplete actions/states. The two have different [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]] and many have different roots. Verbs also mark [[Grammatical mood|mood]], [[Voice (grammar)|voice]], [[Affirmative and negative|polarity]], [[Semelfactive|iterativity]], and [[Intensive word form|intensity]]; and [[Agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with [[Subject (grammar)|subjects]] and [[Object (grammar)|objects]] in [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical person|person]], [[animacy]], and [[Grammatical case|case]]. Sumerian moods are: [[Grammatical mood#indicative|indicative]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], [[Hortative#cohortative|cohortative]], [[Irrealis mood#precative|precative]]/[[Affirmative and negative|affirmative]], [[prospective aspect]]/[[Hortative#cohortative|cohortative mood]], affirmative/negative-[[Volitive modality|volitive]], unrealised-[[Volitive modality|volitive?]], [[Affirmative and negative|negative?]], [[Affirmative and negative|affirmative?]], [[Affirmative and negative|polarative]], and are marked by a verbal prefix. The prefixes appear to conflate mood, aspect, and polarity; and their meanings are also affected by the tense-aspect complex. Sumerian voices are: [[Active voice|active]], and [[Voice (grammar)#middle|middle]] or [[Passive voice|passive]]. Verbs are marked for three persons: 1st, 2nd, 3rd; in two numbers: [[Grammatical number#singular versus plural|singular]] and [[plural]]. [[Finite verb]]s have three classes of prefixes: modal prefixes, conjugational prefixes, and pronominal/dimensional prefixes. Modal prefixes confer the above moods on the verb. Conjugational prefixes are thought to confer perhaps [[Andative and venitive|venitive/andative]], [[Stative verb|being/action]], [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]], [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]], or [[Voice (grammar)|voice]] distinctions on the verb. [[Pronoun|Pronominal]]/[[List of grammatical cases#place and time|dimensional]] prefixes correspond to noun phrases and their [[Grammatical cases|cases]]. [[Nonfinite verb|Non-finite verbs]] include [[participle]]s and [[relative clause]] verbs, both formed through [[Nominalization|nominalisation]]. Finite verbs take prefixes and suffixes, non-finite verbs only take suffixes. Verbal roots are mostly monosyllabic, though verbal root [[Reduplication|duplication]] and [[suppletion]] can also occur to indicate plurality. Root duplication can also indicate iterativity or intensity of the verb.

==Classification==
Sumerian is a [[language isolate]].&lt;ref name="Piotr Michalowski 2004, Pages 19-59"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', 3rd ed., Penguin Books, London, ç1993, p.80-82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joan Oates]], ''Babylon'', Rev. ed., Thames and Hudson, London, ç1986, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Haywood, ''The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Civilizations'', Penguin Books, London, ç2005, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since decipherment, it has been the subject of much effort to relate it to a wide variety of languages. Because it has a peculiar prestige as the most ancient written language, proposals for linguistic affinity sometimes have a nationalistic background. Such proposals enjoy virtually no support amongst linguists because of their unverifiability.&lt;ref name=michal04/&gt; Sumerian was at one time widely held to be an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]], but that view later came to be almost universally rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Dewart, Leslie, 1989.

It has also been suggested that the Sumerian language descended from a late [[Paleolithic]] [[creole language]] (Høyrup 1992).&lt;ref name="Sahala 2009-2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Høyrup, Jens 1998: "Sumerian: The descendant of a proto-historical creole?  An alternative approach to the Sumerian problem" in Published: AIΩN.  Annali del Dipartimento di Studi del Mondo Classico e del  Mediterraneo Antico. Sezione linguistica. Istituto Universitario  Orientale, Napoli 14 (1992; publ. 1994), 21–72, Figs. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, no conclusive evidence, only some typological features, can be found to support Høyrup's view.

A more widespread hypothesis posits a [[Proto-Euphratean language]] that preceded Sumerian in Southern Mesopotamia and exerted an [[Areal feature|areal]] influence on it, especially in the form of polysyllabic words that appear "un-Sumerian"–making them suspect of being [[loanword]]s–and are not traceable to any other known language. There is little speculation as to the affinities of this [[Stratum (linguistics)|substratum]] language, or these languages, and it is thus best treated as [[Unclassified language|unclassified]]. Researchers such as Gonzalo Rubio&lt;ref&gt;Rubio, Gonzalo "On the alleged 'pre-Sumerian substratum'," in ''Journal of Cuneiform Studies'' 51 (1999): 1–16. {{doi|10.2307/1359726}}. {{JSTOR|1359726}}.&lt;/ref&gt; disagree with the assumption of a single substratum language and argue that several languages are involved. A related proposal by Gordon Whittaker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whittaker|first=Gordon|date=2008|title=The Case for Euphratic|journal=Bulletin of the Georgian National Academy of Sciences|location=Tbilisi|volume=2|issue=3|pages=156–168|url=http://science.org.ge/old/moambe/2-3/Gordon%20Whitteker.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that the language of the proto-literary texts from the Late Uruk period ({{circa|lk=no}} 3350–3100 BC) is really an early Indo-European language which he terms "Euphratic".

==Writing system==
{{See also|Cuneiform}}

===Development===
[[File:Letter Luenna Louvre AO4238.jpg|thumb|Letter sent by the high-priest Lu'enna to the king of [[Lagash]] (maybe [[Urukagina]]), informing him of his son's death in combat, c. 2400 BC, found in [[Girsu|Telloh]] (ancient Girsu)]]
The Sumerian language is one of the earliest known written languages. The "proto-literate" period of Sumerian writing spans c. 3300 to 3000 BC. In this period, records are purely [[logographic]], with phonological content. The oldest document of the proto-literate period is the [[Kish tablet]]. [[Adam Falkenstein|Falkenstein]] (1936) lists 939 signs used in the proto-literate period ([[Uruk period|late Uruk]], 34th to 31st centuries).

Records with unambiguously linguistic content, identifiably Sumerian, are those found at [[Jemdet Nasr]], dating to the 31st or 30th century BC. From about 2600 BC, the logographic symbols were generalized using a wedge-shaped stylus to impress the shapes into wet clay. This ''cuneiform'' ("wedge-shaped") mode of writing co-existed with the pre-cuneiform archaic mode. Deimel (1922) lists 870 signs used in the Early Dynastic IIIa period (26th century). In the same period the large set of logographic signs had been simplified into a [[logosyllabic#Logogrammatical systems|logosyllabic script]] comprising several hundred signs. Rosengarten (1967) lists 468 signs used in Sumerian (pre-[[Sargon of Akkad|Sargonian]]) [[Lagash]]. The pre-Sargonian period of the 26th to 24th centuries BC is the "Classical Sumerian" stage of the language.

The cuneiform script was adapted to [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] writing beginning in the mid third millennium. Our knowledge of Sumerian is based on Akkadian glossaries. During the "[[Sumerian Renaissance]]" (Ur III) of the 21st century BC, Sumerian was written in already highly abstract cuneiform glyphs directly succeeded by [[Akkadian language|Old Assyrian]] cuneiform.

===Transcription===
Depending on the context, a cuneiform sign can be read either as one of several possible [[logograms]], each of which corresponds to a word in the Sumerian spoken language, as a phonetic syllable (V, VC, CV, or CVC), or as a [[determinative]] (a marker of semantic category, such as occupation or place). (See the article [[Transliterating cuneiform languages]].) Some Sumerian logograms were written with multiple cuneiform signs. These logograms are called diri-spellings, after the logogram 'diri' which is written with the signs SI and A. The text transliteration of a tablet will show just the logogram, such as the word 'diri', not the separate component signs.

Not all epigraphists are equally reliable, and before a scholar publishes an important treatment of a text, the scholar will often arrange to collate the published transcription against the actual tablet, to see if any signs, especially broken or damaged signs, should be represented differently.

==Historiography==
The key to reading [[logosyllabic]] [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] came from the [[Behistun inscription]], a trilingual cuneiform inscription written in [[Old Persian]], [[Elamite]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. (In a similar manner, the key to understanding [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] was the bilingual [[Rosetta stone]] and Jean-François Champollion's transcription in 1822.)

In 1838 [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]], building on the 1802 work of [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]], was able to [[Decipherment|decipher]] the Old Persian section of the Behistun inscriptions, using his knowledge of modern Persian. When he recovered the rest of the text in 1843, he and others were gradually able to translate the Elamite and Akkadian sections of it, starting with the 37 signs he had deciphered for the Old Persian. Meanwhile, many more cuneiform texts were coming to light from [[archaeological]] excavations, mostly in the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Akkadian language]], which were duly deciphered.

By 1850, however, [[Edward Hincks]] came to suspect a non-Semitic origin for cuneiform. Semitic languages are structured according to [[triconsonantal root|consonantal forms]], whereas cuneiform, when functioning phonetically, was a [[syllabary]], binding consonants to particular vowels. Furthermore, no Semitic words could be found to explain the syllabic values given to particular signs.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Cathcart, "[http://cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdlj/2011/cdlj2011_001.html The Earliest Contributions to the Decipherment of Sumerian and Akkadian]", Cuneiform Digital Library Journal, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Oppert]] suggested that a non-Semitic language had preceded Akkadian in Mesopotamia, and that speakers of this language had developed the cuneiform script.

In 1855 Rawlinson announced the discovery of non-Semitic inscriptions at the southern Babylonian sites of [[Nippur]], [[Larsa]], and [[Uruk]].

In 1856, Hincks argued that the untranslated language was [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] in character. The language was called "Scythic" by some, and, confusingly, "Akkadian" by others. In 1869, Oppert proposed the name "Sumerian", based on the known title "King of Sumer and Akkad", reasoning that if [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] signified the Semitic portion of the kingdom, [[Sumer]] might describe the non-Semitic annex.

Credit for being first to scientifically treat a bilingual Sumerian-Akkadian text belongs to [[Paul Haupt]], who published ''Die sumerischen Familiengesetze'' (The Sumerian family laws) in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Keilschrift, Transcription und Übersetzung : nebst ausführlichem Commentar und zahlreichen Excursen : eine assyriologische Studie'' (Leipzig : J.C. Hinrichs, 1879)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernest de Sarzec]] began excavating the Sumerian site of [[Girsu|Tello]] (ancient Girsu, capital of the state of [[Lagash]]) in 1877, and published the first part of ''Découvertes en Chaldée'' with transcriptions of Sumerian tablets in 1884. The [[University of Pennsylvania]] began excavating Sumerian [[Nippur]] in 1888.

''A Classified List of Sumerian Ideographs'' by R. Brünnow appeared in 1889.

The bewildering number and variety of phonetic values that signs could have in Sumerian led to an unfortunate detour in understanding the language – a [[Paris]]-based [[oriental studies|orientalist]], [[Joseph Halévy]], argued from 1874 onward that Sumerian was not a natural language, but rather a [[secret code]] (a [[cryptolect]]), and for over a decade the leading Assyriologists battled over this issue. For a dozen years, starting in 1885, even the great [[Friedrich Delitzsch]] accepted Halévy's arguments, not renouncing Halévy until 1897.

[[François Thureau-Dangin]] working at the Louvre in Paris also made significant contributions to deciphering Sumerian with publications from 1898 to 1938, such as his 1905 publication of ''Les inscriptions de Sumer et d'Akkad''. [[Charles Fossey]] at the Collège de France in Paris was another prolific and reliable scholar.  His pioneering ''Contribution au Dictionnaire sumérien–assyrien'', Paris 1905–1907, turns out to provide the foundation for P. Anton Deimel's 1934 ''Sumerisch-Akkadisches Glossar'' (vol. III of Deimel's 4-volume ''Sumerisches Lexikon'').

In 1908, [[Stephen Herbert Langdon]] summarized the rapid expansion in knowledge of Sumerian and Akkadian vocabulary in the pages of ''Babyloniaca'', a journal edited by [[Charles Virolleaud]], in an article "Sumerian-Assyrian Vocabularies", which reviewed a valuable new book on rare logograms by Bruno Meissner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=genpub;cc=genpub;sid=925969e1cdb54224dccf86fdb4bdef76;rgn=full%20text;idno=ACG1616.0002.001;view=image;seq=00000217 |title=Sumerian-Assyrian Vocabularies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent scholars have found Langdon's work, including his tablet transcriptions, to be not entirely reliable.

In 1944, a more careful Sumerologist, [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], provided a detailed and readable summary of the decipherment of Sumerian in his ''Sumerian Mythology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum |title=Sumerian Mythology |first=Samuel Noah |last=Kramer |authorlink=Samuel Noah Kramer |year=1944, 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich Delitzsch published a learned Sumerian dictionary and grammar in the form of his ''Sumerisches Glossar'' and ''Grundzüge der sumerischen Grammatik'', both appearing in 1914. Delitzsch's student, [[Arno Poebel]], published a grammar with the same title, ''Grundzüge der sumerischen Grammatik'', in 1923, and for 50 years it would be the standard for students studying Sumerian. Poebel's grammar was finally superseded in 1984 on the publication of ''The Sumerian Language: An Introduction to its History and Grammatical Structure'', by [[Marie-Louise Thomsen]]. While much of Thomsen's understanding of Sumerian grammar would now be rejected by most or all Sumerologists, Thomsen's grammar (often with express mention of the critiques put forward by Pascal Attinger in his 1993 ''Eléments de linguistique sumérienne: La construction de du&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;/e/di 'dire{{'-}}'') is the starting point of most recent academic discussions of Sumerian grammar.

More recent monograph-length grammars of Sumerian include [[Dietz-Otto Edzard]]'s 2003 ''Sumerian Grammar'' and Bram Jagersma's 2010 ''A Descriptive Grammar of Sumerian'' (currently digital, but soon to be printed in revised form by Oxford University Press). Piotr Michalowski's essay (entitled, simply, "Sumerian") in the 2004 ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages'' has also been recognized as a good modern grammatical sketch.

There is relatively little consensus, even among reasonable Sumerologists, in comparison to the state of most modern or classical languages. Verbal morphology in particular is hotly disputed. In addition to the general grammars, there are many monographs and articles about particular areas of Sumerian grammar, without which a survey of the field could not be considered complete.

The primary institutional lexical effort in Sumerian is the [[Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary]] project, begun in 1974. In 2004, the PSD was released on the Web as the ePSD. The project is currently supervised by Steve Tinney. It has not been updated on-line since 2006, but Tinney and colleagues are working on a new edition of the ePSD, a working draft of which is available on-line.

==Phonology and grammar==
[[Linguistic typology|Typologically]], as mentioned above, Sumerian is classified as an [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]], [[split ergativity|split-ergative]] language. Ever since its decipherment, the research of Sumerian has been made difficult not only by the lack of any native speakers, but also by the relative sparseness of linguistic data, the apparent lack of a closely related language, and the features of the writing system.

Assumed phonological or morphological forms will be between slashes //, with plain text used for the standard Assyriological transcription of Sumerian. Most of the following examples are unattested.

===Phonemic inventory===
Modern knowledge of Sumerian phonology is flawed and incomplete because of the lack of native speakers, the transmission through the filter of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] phonology and the difficulties posed by the cuneiform script. As [[I.M. Diakonoff]] observes, "when we try to find out the morphophonological structure of the Sumerian language, we must constantly bear in mind that we are not dealing with a language directly but are reconstructing it from a very imperfect mnemonic writing system which had not been basically aimed at the rendering of morphophonemics".&lt;ref&gt;[https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/as20.pdf#page=126 Diakonoff 1976:112]&lt;/ref&gt;

* a simple distribution of six [[stop consonant]]s, in three [[place of articulation|places of articulation]] distinguished by [[Aspirated consonant|aspiration]], though later stages may have featured voicing:
** p ([[Voiceless bilabial stop|voiceless aspirated bilabial plosive]]),
** t ([[Voiceless dental and alveolar stops|voiceless aspirated alveolar plosive]]),
** k ([[Voiceless velar stop|voiceless aspirated velar plosive]]),
*** As a rule, {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} did not occur word-finally.&lt;ref&gt;[Keetman, J. 2007. "Gab es ein ''h'' im Sumerischen?" In: ''Babel und Bibel'' 3, p.21]&lt;/ref&gt;
** b ([[Voiced bilabial stop|voiced unaspirated bilabial plosive]]),
** d ([[Voiced dental and alveolar stops|voiced unaspirated alveolar plosive]]),
** g ([[Voiced velar stop|voiced unaspirated velar plosive]]).
* a [[phoneme]] usually represented by /ř/ (sometimes written ''dr'') that was probably a [[Voiceless alveolar affricate|voiceless aspirated alveolar affricate]]. This phoneme later became {{IPA|/d/}} or {{IPA|/r/}} in northern and southern dialects, respectively.
* a simple distribution of three [[nasal stop|nasal consonants]] in similar distribution to the stops:
** m ([[bilabial nasal]]),
** n ([[alveolar nasal]]),
** g̃ (frequently printed ĝ due to typesetting constraints, increasingly transcribed as ŋ) {{IPA|/ŋ/}} (likely a [[velar nasal]], as in ''si'''ng''''', it has also been argued to be a [[Labialization|labiovelar]] nasal or a [[nasalization|nasalized]] [[Labial–velar consonant|labiovelar]]&lt;ref name=michal08/&gt;).
* a set of three [[sibilant consonant|sibilants]]:
** s, likely a [[voiceless alveolar fricative]],
** z, likely a [[Voiceless alveolar affricate|voiceless unaspirated alveolar affricate]], {{IPA|/t͡s/}}, as shown by Akkadian loans from {{IPA|/s/}}={{IPA|[t͡s]}} to Sumerian {{IPA|/z/}}. In early Sumerian, this would have been the unaspirated counterpart to /ř/.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sound change in Sumerian: the so-called /dr/-phoneme|url = https://www.academia.edu/7754980/Sound_change_in_Sumerian_the_so-called_dr_-phoneme|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** š (generally described as a [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]], {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, as in '''''sh'''ip'')
* ḫ (a [[voiceless velar fricative|velar fricative]], {{IPA|/x/}}, sometimes written h)
* two [[liquid consonant]]s:
** l (a [[lateral consonant]])
** r (a [[rhotic consonant]])

The existence of various other consonants has been hypothesized based on graphic alternations and loans, though none have found wide acceptance. For example, [[Igor Diakonoff|Diakonoff]] lists evidence for two l-sounds, two r-sounds, two h-sounds, and two g-sounds (excluding the velar nasal), and assumes a phonemic difference between consonants that are dropped word-finally (such as the ''g'' in zag &gt; za3) and consonants that remain (such as the ''g'' in lag). Other "hidden" consonant phonemes that have been suggested include semivowels such as {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}},&lt;ref name=etcsl2005/&gt; and a [[voiceless glottal fricative|glottal fricative]] {{IPA|/h/}} or a [[glottal stop]] that could explain the absence of [[Contraction (phonology)|vowel contraction]] in some words&lt;ref&gt;Attinger, Pascal, 1993. ''Eléments de linguistique sumérienne''. p. 212 [https://www.webcitation.org/6HAwliaIc?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110103084319/http://doc.rero.ch/lm.php?url=1000%2C40%2C4%2C20080304131832-QE%2Fth_AttingerP.pdf] ([https://www.webcitation.org/6HAwliaIc?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110103084319/http://doc.rero.ch/lm.php?url=1000,40,4,20080304131832-QE/th_AttingerP.pdf Archive])&lt;/ref&gt;—though objections have been raised against that as well.&lt;ref&gt;[Keetman, J. 2007. "Gab es ein ''h'' im Sumerischen?" In: ''Babel und Bibel'' 3, ''passim'']&lt;/ref&gt; A recent descriptive grammar by Bram Jagersma includes {{IPA|/j/}}, {{IPA|/h/}}, and {{IPA|/ʔ/}} as unwritten consonants, with the glottal stop even serving as the first-person pronominal prefix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/16107|title=A descriptive grammar of Sumerian|last=Jagersma|first=Abraham Hendrik|last2=|first2=|date=|website=openaccess.leidenuniv.nl|page=33, 388|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very often, a word-final consonant was not expressed in writing – and was possibly omitted in pronunciation – so it surfaced only when followed by a vowel: for example the /k/ of the [[genitive case]] ending -ak does not appear in e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lugal-la "the king's house", but it becomes obvious in e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lugal-la-kam "(it) is the king's house" (compare [[Liaison (French)|liaison]] in French).

====Vowels====
The vowels that are clearly distinguished by the cuneiform script are {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}}. Various researchers have posited the existence of more vowel phonemes such as {{IPA|/o/}} and even {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, which would have been concealed by the transmission through Akkadian, as that language does not distinguish them.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=keetman2013/&gt; That would explain the seeming existence of numerous homophones in transliterated Sumerian, as well as some details of the phenomena mentioned in the next paragraph.&lt;ref&gt;[https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/51326989.pdf Zólyomi, Gábor. 2016. An introduction to the grammar of Sumerian. P. 12-13]&lt;/ref&gt; These hypotheses are not yet generally accepted.&lt;ref name=michal08/&gt;

There is some evidence for [[vowel harmony]] according to [[vowel height]] or [[advanced tongue root]] in the prefix i&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/e- in inscriptions from pre-[[Sargon the Great|Sargonic]] [[Lagash]]&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Smith, Eric J M. 2007. [-ATR] "Harmony and the Vowel Inventory of Sumerian". ''Journal of Cuneiform Studies'', volume 57&lt;/ref&gt;, and perhaps even more than one vowel harmony rule.&lt;ref name=keetman2009&gt;Keetman, J. 2009. "[http://sepoa.fr/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2009-4.pdf The limits of &lt;nowiki&gt;[ATR]&lt;/nowiki&gt; vowel harmony in Sumerian and some remarks about the need of transparent data]".

Babel und Bibel 7 p.109-154&lt;/ref&gt; There also appear to be many cases of partial or complete [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of the vowel of certain prefixes and suffixes to one in the adjacent syllable reflected in writing in some of the later periods, and there is a noticeable, albeit not absolute, tendency for disyllabic stems to have the same vowel in both syllables.&lt;ref name=michal08p17/&gt; These patterns, too, are interpreted as evidence for a richer vowel inventory by some researchers.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=keetman2013/&gt; What appears to be [[Contraction (phonology)|vowel contraction]] in [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] (*/aa/, */ia/, */ua/ &gt; a, */ae/ &gt; a, */ue/ &gt; u, etc.) is also very common.

Syllables could have any of the following structures: V, CV, VC, CVC. More complex syllables, if Sumerian had them, are not expressed as such by the cuneiform script.

===Grammar===

====Nominal morphology====
The Sumerian [[noun]] is typically a one or two syllable root (''igi'' "eye", ''e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' "house, household", ''nin'' "lady"), although there are also some roots with three syllables like ''šakanka'' "market". There are two [[grammatical gender]]s, usually called [[animacy|human and non-human]] (the first includes gods and the word for "statue" in some instances, but not plants or animals, the latter also includes collective plural nouns), whose assignment is semantically predictable.

The [[adjective]]s and other [[modifiers]] follow the noun (''lugal maḫ'' "great king"). The noun itself is not inflected; rather, grammatical markers attach to the [[noun phrase]] as a whole, in a certain order. Typically, that order would be '''noun''' – '''adjective''' – '''numeral''' – '''genitive phrase''' – '''relative clause''' – '''possessive marker''' – '''plural marker''' – '''case marker''', for example /dig̃ir gal-gal-g̃u-ne-ra/ ("god great ([[Reduplication|reduplicated]])-my-plural-dative" = "for all my great gods").&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.fh-giessen.de/kausen/wordtexte/Sumerisch.doc Kausen, Ernst. 2006. ''Sumerische Sprache''. p.9]&lt;/ref&gt; The possessive, plural and case markers are traditionally referred to as "[[suffixes]]", but have recently also been described as [[enclitic]]s&lt;ref&gt;Zólyomi, Gábor, 1993: ''Voice and Topicalization in Sumerian''. PhD Dissertation [http://www.assziriologia.hu/downloads/gzolyomiphd.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[postpositions]].&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;Johnson, Cale, 2004: ''In the Eye of the Beholder: Quantificational, Pragmatic and Aspectual Features of the *bí- Verbal Formation in Sumerian'', Dissertation. UCLA, Los Angeles [http://cdli.ucla.edu/staff/johnson/Johnson_diss_2004.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622050103/http://cdli.ucla.edu/staff/johnson/Johnson_diss_2004.pdf |date=2013-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plural markers are /-(e)ne/ (optional) for nouns of the human gender. Non-human nouns are not marked by a plural suffix. However, plurality can also be expressed with the adjective ''ḫi-a'' "various", with the plural of the copula /-meš/, by reduplication of the noun (''kur-kur'' "all foreign lands") or of the following adjective (''a gal-gal'' "all the great waters") (reduplication is believed to signify totality) or by the plurality of only the verb form. Plural reference in the verb form occurs only for human nouns. The case markers are /-Ø/ ([[absolutive case|absolutive]]), /-e/ ([[ergative case|ergative]]), /-e/ ([[allative case|allative]] = "to"), /-ak/ ([[genitive case|genitive]]), /-gin/ ([[Equative case|equative]] = "as, like"), /-r(a)/ ([[dative case|dative]] = "to, for" = indirect object), /-(e)š(e)/ (traditionally called [[terminative case]], but means "towards"), /-da/ ([[comitative case|comitative]] = "together with"), /-a/ ([[locative case|locative]] = "in, at"), /-ta/ ([[ablative case|ablative]] = "from, by"). Additional spatial or temporal meanings can be expressed by genitive phrases like "at the head of" = "above", "at the face of" = "in front of", "at the outer side of" = "because of" etc.: ''bar udu ḫad&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ak-a'' = "outer.side sheep white-genitive-locative" = "in the outer side of a white sheep" = "because of a white sheep".

The attested independent [[personal pronoun]]s are written ''g̃e&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;-e'' (1st p. sing.), ''ze&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-e'' (2nd p. sing.), ''a-ne'' or ''e-ne'' (3rd p. sing. human), and ''a/e-ne-ne'' (3rd p. pl. human). The possessive pronominal morphemes are written ''-g̃u&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;'' (1st p. sing.), ''-zu'' (2nd p. sing.), ''-(a)-n(i)'' (3rd p. sing. human), ''-b(i)'' (3rd p. sing./pl. non-human, also demonstrative and collective), ''-me'' (1st pers. pl.), ''-zu-ne-ne'' (2nd p. pl.), and ''-(a)-ne-ne'' (3rd pers.pl. animate). For most of the suffixes, vowels are subject to loss if they are attached to vowel-final words.

The [[center embedding|embedded]] structure of the noun phrase can be illustrated with the phrase ''sipad udu siki-ak-ak-ene'' ("the shepherds of woolly sheep"), where the first genitive morpheme (''-a(k)'') subordinates ''siki'' "wool" to ''udu'' "sheep", and the second subordinates ''udu siki-a(k)'' "sheep of wool" (or "woolly sheep") to ''sipad'' "shepherd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zólyomi|first1=Gábor|editor1-last=Grzegorek|editor1-first=Katarzyna|editor2-last=Borowska|editor2-first=Anna|editor3-last=Kirk|editor3-first=Allison|title=Copular Clauses and Focus Marking in Sumerian|date=2014|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-040169-1|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jQruCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Verbal morphology====

=====General=====
The Sumerian [[finite verb]] distinguishes a number of [[grammatical mood|moods]] and [[agreement (grammar)|agrees]] (more or less consistently) with the subject and the object in person, number and gender. The verb chain may also incorporate pronominal references to the verb's other modifiers, which has also traditionally been described as "agreement", although, in fact, such a reference ''and'' the presence of an actual modifier in the clause need not co-occur: not only '''e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-še'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; i'''b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ši'''-du-un "I'm going to the house", but also '''e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-še'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; i&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-du-un "I'm going to the house" and simply i'''b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ši'''-du-un "I'm going to it" are possible.&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt;

The Sumerian verb also makes a binary distinction according to a category that some regard as tense (past vs present-future), others as [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] (perfective vs imperfective), and that will be designated as '''TA''' (tense/aspect) in the following. The two members of the opposition entail different conjugation patterns and, at least for many verbs, different stems; they are theory-neutrally referred to with the [[Akkadians|Akkadian]] grammatical terms for the two respective forms – ''ḫamṭu'' (quick) and ''marû'' (slow, fat). Finally, opinions differ on whether the verb has a [[passive voice|passive]] or a [[middle voice]] and how it is expressed.

The verbal root is almost always a monosyllable and, together with various [[affix]]es, forms a so-called verbal chain which is described as a sequence of about 15 slots, though the precise models differ.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Rubio 2007, Attinger 1993, Zólyomi 2005 ("Sumerisch". In: ''Sprachen des Alten Orients'', ed. M. Streck), [http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/ppcs/MorphologyTable.html PPCS Morphological model] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025205450/http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/ppcs/MorphologyTable.html |date=October 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[finite verb]] has both [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es, while the [[non-finite verb]] may only have suffixes. Broadly, the prefixes have been divided in three groups that occur in the following order: '''modal prefixes''', "'''conjugation prefixes'''", and '''pronominal and dimensional''' prefixes.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Attinger 1993, Rubio 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The suffixes are a future or imperfective marker /-ed-/, pronominal suffixes, and an /-a/ ending that nominalizes the whole verb chain.

=====Modal prefixes=====
The '''modal prefixes''' are :
* /Ø-/ ([[indicative mood|indicative]]),
* /nu-/ and /la-/, /li-/ ([[negative mood|negative]]; /la/ and /li/ are used before the conjugation prefixes ba- and bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-),
* /ga-/ ([[cohortative mood|cohortative]], "let me/us"),
* /ḫa-/ or /ḫe-/ with further assimilation of the vowel in later periods ([[Precative mood|precative]] or affirmative),
* /u-/ ([[prospective aspect|prospective]] "after/when/if", also used as a mild imperative),
* /na-/ (negative or affirmative),
* /bara-/ (negative or vetitive),
* /nuš-/ (unrealizable wish?) and
* /ša-/ with further assimilation of the vowel in later periods (affirmative?).

Their meaning can depend on the TA.

====="Conjugation prefixes"=====
The meaning, structure, identity and even the number of "'''conjugation prefixes'''" have always been a subject of disagreements. The term "conjugation prefix" simply alludes to the fact that a [[finite verb]] in the [[indicative mood]] must always contain one of them. Some of their most frequent expressions in writing are mu-, i&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;- ([[Early Dynastic Period of Sumer|ED]] [[Lagash|Lagaš]] variant: e-), ba-, bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- (ED Lagaš: bi- or be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), im-, im-ma- (ED Lagaš e-ma-), im-mi- (ED Lagaš i&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-mi or e-me-), mi- (always followed by pronominal-dimensional -ni-) and al-, and to a lesser extent a-, am&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-, am&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-ma-, and am&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-mi-; virtually all analyses attempt to describe many of the above as combinations or allomorphs of each other. The starting point of most analyses are the obvious facts that the 1st person dative always requires mu-, and that the verb in a "passive" clause without an overt [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] tends to have ba-. Proposed explanations usually revolve around the subtleties of spatial grammar, information structure ([[Focus (linguistics)|focus]]&lt;ref&gt;Rubio 2007 and references therein&lt;/ref&gt;), [[verb valency]], and, most recently, [[grammatical voice|voice]].&lt;ref&gt;Zólyomi 1993; Also Woods, Cristopher, 2008: ''The Grammar of Perspective: The Sumerian Conjugation Prefixes as a System of Voice''&lt;/ref&gt; Mu-, im- and am&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;- have been described as [[ventive]] morphemes, while ba- and bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- are sometimes analyzed as actually belonging to the pronominal-dimensional group (inanimate pronominal /-b-/ + dative /-a-/ or directive /-i-/).&lt;ref name="E.g. Zólyomi 1993"&gt;E.g. Zólyomi 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Im-ma-, im-mi-, am&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-ma- and am&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-mi- are then considered by some as a combination of the ventive and /ba-/, /bi-/&lt;ref name="E.g. Zólyomi 1993"/&gt; or otherwise a variety of the ventive.&lt;ref name="Rubio 2007"&gt;Rubio 2007&lt;/ref&gt; I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;- has been argued to be a mere [[prothetic]] vowel, al- a [[stative verb|stative]] prefix, ba- a [[middle voice]] prefix, etcetera.

=====Pronominal and dimensional prefixes=====
The '''dimensional prefixes''' of the verb chain basically correspond to, and often repeat, the case markers of the noun phrase. Like the latter, they are attached to a "head" – a '''pronominal prefix'''. The other place where a pronominal prefix can be placed is immediately before the stem, where it can have a different allomorph and expresses the absolutive or the ergative participant (the transitive subject, the intransitive subject or the direct object), depending on the TA and other factors, as explained below. However, this neat system is obscured by the tendency to drop or merge many of the prefixes in writing and possibly in pronunciation as well. -da-, -ta-, -ši- (early -še&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-), occurring in this order, are the comitative, ablative and terminative verbal prefixes; the dative (occurring before the others) is probably /-a-/, and a directive /-i-/ (occurring after the others) is widely recognized as well. The pronominal prefixes are /-n-/ and /-b-/ for the 3rd person singular animate and inanimate respectively; the 2nd person singular appears as -e- in most contexts, but as /-r-/ before the dative (-ra-), leading some&lt;ref name="Zólyomi 2005"&gt;Zólyomi 2005&lt;/ref&gt; to assume a phonetic /-ir-/ or /-jr-/. The 1st person may appear as -e-, too, but is more commonly not expressed at all (the same may frequently apply to 3rd and 2nd persons); it is, however, cued by the choice of mu- as conjugation prefix&lt;ref name="Rubio 2007"/&gt; (/mu-/ + /-a-/ → ma-). The 1st, 2nd and 3rd plural infixes are -me-,-re?- and -ne- in the dative&lt;ref name="Rubio 2007"/&gt; and perhaps in other contexts as well,&lt;ref name="Zólyomi 2005"/&gt; though not in the pre-stem position (see below). An additional exception from the system is the prefix -ni- which corresponds to a noun phrase in the locative – in which case it doesn't seem to be preceded by a pronominal prefix – and, according to Gábor Zólyomi and others, to an animate one in the directive – in the latter case it is analyzed as pronominal /-n-/ + directive /-i-/. Zólyomi and others also believe that special meanings can be expressed by combinations of non-identical noun case and verb prefix.&lt;ref name="Zólyomi2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zólyomi |year=2000 |title=Structural interference from Akkadian in Old Babylonian Sumerian |journal=Acta Sumerologica |volume=22 |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.assziriologia.hu/downloads/gz_structural_interference.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to some researchers&lt;ref&gt;Zólyomi 1993, Attinger 1993&lt;/ref&gt; /-ni-/ and /bi-/ acquire the forms /-n-/ and /-b-/ (coinciding with the ''absolutive–ergative'' pronominal prefixes) before the stem if there isn't already an absolutive–ergative pronominal prefix in pre-stem position: mu-un-kur&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; = /mu-ni-kur/ "he went in there" (as opposed to mu-ni-kur&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; = mu-ni-in-kur&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; = /mu-ni-n-kur/ "he brought in – caused [something or someone] to go in – there".

=====Pronominal suffixes and conjugation=====
The '''pronominal suffixes''' are /-en/ for the first- and second-person singular, /-e/ for the third singular in ''marû'' TA and /-Ø/ in ''ḫamṭu'' TA, /-enden/ for the first plural, /-enzen/ for the second plural, /-ene/ for the third plural in ''marû'' and /-eš/ in ''ḫamṭu'' (the initial vowel in all of the above suffixes can be assimilated to the root). The general principle for '''pronominal agreement in conjugation''' is that in ''ḫamṭu'' TA, the transitive subject is expressed by the prefix, and the direct object by the suffix, and in the ''marû'' TA it is the other way round; as for the intransitive subject, it is expressed, in both TAs, by the suffixes and is thus treated like the object in ''ḫamṭu'' and like the subject in ''marû'' (except that its third person is expressed, not only in ''ḫamṭu'' but also in ''marû'', by the suffixes used for the ''object'' in the ''ḫamṭu'' TA). A major exception from this generalization are the plural forms – in them, not only the prefix (as in the singular), but also the suffix expresses the transitive subject. Additionally, the prefixes of the plural are identical to those of the singular – /-?-/ or /-e-/, /-e-/, /-n-/, /-b-/ – as opposed to the -me-, -re-?, -ne- that are presumed for non-pre-stem position – and some scholars believe that the prefixes of the 1st and second person are /-en-/ rather than /-e-/ when they stand for the object.&lt;ref&gt;Attinger 1993, Khachikyan 2007: ("Towards the Aspect System in Sumerian". In: ''Babel und Bibel'' 3.)&lt;/ref&gt; Before the pronominal suffixes, a suffix /-e(d)-/ with a [[future tense|future]] or related modal meaning can be inserted, accounting for occurrences of -e in the third-person singular ''marû'' of intransitive forms; because of its meaning, it can also be said to signal ''marû'' in these forms.&lt;ref name="Zólyomi 2005"/&gt;

Examples for TA and pronominal agreement: (''ḫamṭu'' is rendered with past tense, ''marû'' with present): /i-gub-en/ ("I stood" or "I stand"), /i-n-gub-en/ ("he placed me" or "I place him"); /i-sug-enden/ ("we stood/stand"); /i-n-dim-enden/ ("he created us" or "we create him"); /mu-e?-dim-enden/ ("we created [someone or something]"); i&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-gub-be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = /i-gub-ed/ ("he will/must stand"); ib&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-gub-be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = /i-b-gub-e/ ("he places it"); /i-b-dim-ene/ ("they create it"), /i-n-dim-eš/ ("they created [someone or something]" or "he created them"), /i-sug-eš/ ("they stood" or "they stand").

Confusingly, the subject and object prefixes (/-n-/, /-b-/, /-e-/) are not commonly spelled out in early texts, although the "full" spellings do become more usual during the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] (in the Neo-Sumerian period) and especially during the Late Sumerian period. Thus, in earlier texts, one finds mu-ak and i&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-ak (e-ak in early dynastic Lagash) instead of mu-un-ak and in-ak for /mu-n-ak/ and /i-n-ak/ "he/she made", and also mu-ak instead of mu-e-ak "you made". Similarly, pre-Ur III texts also spell the first- and second-person suffix /-en/ as -e, making it coincide with the third person in the ''marû'' form.

=====Stem=====
The verbal '''stem''' itself can also express grammatical distinctions. The plurality of the absolutive participant&lt;ref name="Rubio 2007"/&gt; can be expressed by complete reduplication of the stem or by a [[suppletive]] stem. Reduplication can also express "plurality of the action itself",&lt;ref name="Rubio 2007"/&gt; intensity or [[iterative|iterativity]].&lt;ref name="etcsl2005" /&gt; With respect to TA marking, verbs are divided in 4 types; ''ḫamṭu'' is always the unmarked TA. The stems of the 1st type, regular verbs, do not express TA at all according to most scholars, or, according to M. Yoshikawa and others, express ''marû'' TA by adding an (assimilating) /-e-/ as in gub-be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or gub-bu vs gub (which is, however, nowhere distinguishable from the first vowel of the pronominal suffixes except for intransitive ''marû'' 3rd person singular). The 2nd type express ''marû'' by partial reduplication of the stem as kur&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; vs ku&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-ku&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;; the 3rd type express ''marû'' by adding a consonant (te vs teg̃&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;); and the 4th type use a suppletive stem (dug&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; vs e). Thus, as many as four different suppletive stems can exist, as in the admittedly extreme case of the verb "to go": g̃en ("to go", ''ḫamṭu'' sing.), du (''marû'' sing.), (e-)re&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (''ḫamṭu'' plur.), sub&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (''marû'' plur.)

=====Other issues=====
The '''nominalizing suffix''' /-a/ converts non-finite and finite verbs into participles and relative clauses: sum-ma "given", mu-na-an-sum-ma "which he gave to him", "who gave (something) to him", etc.. Adding /-a/ after the future/modal suffix /-ed/ produces a form with a meaning similar to the [[gerundive#In Latin|Latin gerundive]]: sum-mu-da = "which will/should be given". On the other hand, adding a (locative-terminative?) /-e/ after the /-ed/ yields a form with a meaning similar to the [[Latin conjugation#The gerund|Latin ''ad'' + gerund (acc.) construction]]: sum-mu-de&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = "(in order) to give".

The [[copula verb]] /me/ "to be" is mostly used as an enclitic: -men, -men, -am, -menden, -menzen, -(a)meš.

The '''[[imperative mood]]''' construction is produced with a singular ''ḫamṭu'' stem, but using the ''marû'' agreement pattern, by turning all prefixes into suffixes: mu-na-an-sum "he gave (something) to him", mu-na-e-sum-mu-un-ze&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-en "you (plur.) gave (something) to him" – sum-mu-na-ab "give it to him!", sum-mu-na-ab-ze&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-en "give (plur.) it to him!" Compare the French ''tu le lui donnes'', ''vous le lui donnez'' (present tense) – ''donne-le-lui!'', ''donnez-le-lui!''&lt;ref name="Rubio 2007"/&gt;

====Syntax====
The basic word order is [[subject–object–verb]]; verb finality is only violated in rare instances, in poetry. The moving of a constituent towards the beginning of the phrase may be a way to highlight it,&lt;ref name="Zólyomi 1993"&gt;Zólyomi 1993&lt;/ref&gt; as may the addition of the copula to it. The so-called anticipatory genitive (e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-a lugal-bi "the owner of the house/temple", lit. "of the house, its owner") is common and may signal the possessor's [[topic (linguistics)|topicality]].&lt;ref name="Zólyomi 1993"/&gt; There are various ways to express [[subordinate clause|subordination]], some of which have already been hinted at; they include [[Sumerian language#Other issues|the nominalization of a verb]], which can then be followed by case morphemes and possessive pronouns (kur9-ra-ni "when he entered") and included in [[Sumerian language#Nominal morphology|"prepositional" constructions]] (eg̃er a-ma-ru ba-ur&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-ra-ta "back – flood – conjugation prefix – sweep over – nominalizing suffix – [genitive suffix?] – ablative suffix" = "from the back of the Flood's sweeping-over" = "after the [[Deluge (mythology)|Flood]] had swept over"). [[Subordinating conjunction]]s such as ud-da "when, if", tukum-bi "if" are also used, though the [[coordinating conjunction]] u&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; "and", a Semitic adoption, is rarely used. A specific problem of Sumerian syntax is posed by the numerous so-called [[compound verb]]s, which usually involve a noun immediately before the verb, forming a lexical or [[idiom]]atic unit&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2004:22&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. šu...ti, lit. "hand-approach" = "receive"; igi...du&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, lit. "eye-open" = "see"). Some of them are claimed to have a special agreement pattern that they share with [[causative]] constructions: their logical object, like the causee, receives, in the verb, the directive infix, but in the noun, the dative suffix if animate and the directive if inanimate.&lt;ref name="Zólyomi2000" /&gt;

'''Ullaskar Dutta''' ({{lang-bn|উল্লাসকর দত্ত}}) (16 April 1885 – 17 May 1965) was a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[British India|Indian]] revolutionary associated with [[Anushilan Samiti]] and [[Jugantar]] of Bengal and was a close associate of [[Barin Ghosh|Barindra nath Ghosh]]. 

==Early life==
Ullaskar was born in the village of Kalikachha in the [[Brahmanbaria District|Brahmanbaria]] district of present-day [[Bangladesh]] in a [[Baidya]] family. His father Dwijadas Duttagupta was a member of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] and had a degree in Agriculture from the [[University of London]]. After passing entrance examination in 1903, he took admission in the [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]], [[Kolkata]]. However, he was [[Rustication (academia)|rusticated]] from the college for hitting a British professor, Professor Russell, who made some derogatory comment about [[Bengal]]is.

==Revolutionary activities==
Ullaskar was a member of the [[Jugantar]] party and he became expert in bomb-making. [[Khudiram Bose]] used a bomb manufactured by Ullaskar and [[Hemchandra Kanungo|Hem Chandra Das]] &lt;ref&gt;Government of India, Home Political Department A. [http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/research/show.php?set=doclife&amp;id=14 ''Proceedings, May 1908, Nos. 112-150]''&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to murder brutal magistrate, Kingsford. However, police caught many members of the Jugantar group including Ullaskar Dutta, [[Barindra Ghosh]] and Khudiram.

==Trial and sentence==
In the famous [[Alipore bomb case]], Ullaskar was arrested on 2 May 1908 and he was sentenced to death by hanging in 1909. Later, on appeal, the verdict was reduced to transportation for life and he was deported to the [[Cellular Jail]] in [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]].

==Cellular jail==
Ullaskar was subjected to brutal torture in the Cellular Jail and is said have lost his mental balance. He was set free in 1920 and he returned to Kolkata.

==Later life==
Ullaskar was again arrested in 1931 and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. He returned to his home village Kalikachha when colonial rule ended in 1947. After a lonely life of 10 years, he returned to Kolkata in 1957.
After returning to Kolkata he married a physically challenged woman and went to [[Silchar]], the district town of [[Cachar District]] of [[Assam]] and spent his later life there.  He died on 17 May 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=4N5oTOG_KNP0cN-l-I8F&amp;ct=result&amp;id=IDQgAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=ullaskar+dutta&amp;q=%22ullaskar+dutta%22#search_anchor Official Report, Assam Legislative Assembly]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, two roads in Kolkata and Silchar were named after him.

'''''Vyākaraṇa''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: "explanation, analysis") refers to one of the six ancient [[Vedanga]]s, ancillary science connected with the [[Vedas]], which are scriptures in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca769&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Vyakarana" in ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 769&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=36}} Vyākaraṇa is the study of Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Johnson (2009), ''A Dictionary of Hinduism'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198610250}}, article on Vyākaraṇa&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=105}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lisa Mitchell|title=Language, Emotion, and Politics in South India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fBchTO0NS0EC|year=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-35301-7|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pāṇini]] and [[Yāska]] are the two celebrated ancient scholars of Vyākaraṇa; both are dated to several centuries prior to the start of the common era, with Pāṇini likely from the fifth century BCE.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|pp=13–14}} Pāṇini's ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' is the most important surviving text of the Vyākaraṇa traditions. This text consists of eight chapters, each divided into four padas, cumulatively containing 4000 sutras.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|pp=14, 111}} The text is preceded by abbreviation rules grouping the phonemes of Sanskrit.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=111}} Pāṇini quotes ten ancient authorities whose texts have not survived, but they are believed to have been Vyākaraṇa scholars.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=111}}

Vyākaraṇa is related to the fourth Vedanga called ''[[Nirukta]]''.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=105}}  Vyākaraṇa scholarship has dealt with linguistic analysis to establish the exact form of words to properly express ideas, and ''Nirukta'' scholarship has focussed on linguistic analysis to help establish the proper meaning of the words in context.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=105}}

Vyākaraṇa ({{IPA-sa|ʋjɑːkərəɳə|IPA}}) means "separation, distinction, discrimination, analysis, explanation" of something.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsvyakar/&gt;{{Sfn|Tibor Kiss|2015|pp=74-75}}&lt;ref name=damienkeownvya&gt;Damien Keown (2004), A Dictionary of Buddhism, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198605607}}, [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803120305298 Article on ''Vyakarana'']&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to one of the six Vedangas, or the Vedic field of language analysis, specifically grammatical analysis, grammar, linguistic conventions which creates, polishes, helps a writer express and helps a reader discriminate accurate language.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsvyakar&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA978|year=1923|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=vi, 978}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Harold G.

The word Vyākaraṇa is also found in [[Mahayana sutras]] and first millennium [[Mahayana]] Buddhist texts, but with a different meaning. Vyākaraṇa, in these Buddhist texts, means a prediction or prophecy by a [[buddhahood|buddha]] to a [[bodhisattva]] who has just embarked on the path, that he will achieve enlightenment and be a buddha.&lt;ref name=damienkeownvya/&gt;

==History==
Vyākaraṇa emerged as a distinct auxiliary field of Vedic study in ancient times.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=12-14, 36}}{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|1963|p=458}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joel Peter Brereton|author2=[[Stephanie W. Jamison]]|author3=Madhav M.

Coward|1990|p=36}} Vyākaraṇa helped ensure that the Vedic scriptures of Hinduism and its message of "Sabda Brahman" (explanation of metaphysical truths through words) that Vedic [[Rishi]]s had realized by their efforts, remains available to all in a pristine form.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=36}} In Indian traditions, Vyākaraṇa has been one of the most important sciences, one extensively studied over its history, and that led to major treatises in the philosophy of language.{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|1963|pp=458-459}}

Pāṇini and Yāska, two celebrated ancient scholars of Vyākaraṇa, are both dated to several centuries prior to the start of the common era, likely the 5th-century BCE.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|pp=13-14}} However, both of them cite prior scholars and texts, which though lost to history, imply that the field of Vyākaraṇa was an established and developed science of language before them.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=13}} Between the two, Yaksa may be the older one and more known for ''Nirukta'' (etymology) – the fourth auxiliary field of Vedic studies, but the evidence for him preceding Pāṇini is scanty and uncertain.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=14}} In terms of dedicated treatise on Vyākaraṇa, Pāṇini is the most recognized ancient Hindu scholar, and his ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' ("Eight Chapters") is the most studied extant ancient manuscript on Sanskrit grammar.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=14}} Pāṇini's fame spread outside India, and the reverence for ancient Pāṇini in northwest India is mentioned in Chinese texts of [[Xuanzang]] – the 7th-century traveller and scholar.{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|1963|p=462}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Frits Staal]] (1972), ''A Reader on the Sanskrit Grammarians'', Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, reprint by Motilal Banarsidass (1985), {{ISBN|81-208-0029-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of grammar and the structure of language is traceable to the [[Rigveda]], or 2nd millennium BCE, in hymns attributed to sage Sakalya.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|pp=13-14}}{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|1963|p=459}}{{refn|group=note|In addition to explicit references to Vyākaraṇa, Rigveda has numerous embedded Riddle hymns, a few of which ancient and medieval Hindu scholars interpreted to be referring to linguistics and grammar. For example, the riddle verse 4.58.3 of the Rigveda states,{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|p=476 with footnote 27}}&lt;br/&gt;"Four horns, three feet, two heads and seven hands he has.&lt;br/&gt;The bull is thrice bound and roars.&lt;br/&gt;Great is the god who has entered the man". – [[Rigveda]] 4.58.3&lt;br/&gt;Patañjali interprets this riddle as follows, state Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus: The four horns represent the four parts of speech: nouns, verbs, prefixes and particles. The three feet are the three main tenses: present, future, past; the two heads are the conventional and the etymological meaning of a word; the seven hands are the seven cases in Sanskrit; the three places where the roaring bull is bound are the three resonating spaces - the chest, the neck and the head' and the great god in riddle is the word.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|pp=476-477}}}} Sakalya is acknowledged by Pāṇini's works.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|pp=13-14}} The literary evidence that the science of Vyākaraṇa existed in Vedic times abound in the [[Brahmana]]s, [[Aranyaka]]s and [[Upanishads]], states [[Moriz Winternitz]].{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|1963|pp=459-460}} The extant manuscripts of Pāṇini and Yaksa suggest that the Vedic age had competing schools of grammar. One school, for example, held that all nouns have verbal roots, while another held that not all nouns have verbal roots.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|pp=13-14}} However, it is unclear how, who or when these ancient Vedic theories of grammar originated, because those texts have not survived into the modern era.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|pp=13-14}}

===Pre-Pāṇinian schools===
There were many schools of Sanskrit grammar in ancient India, all established before the mid 1st-millennium BCE.{{Sfn|George Cardona|1997|pp=148-157}} Pāṇini's ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' , which eclipsed all other ancient schools of grammar, mentions the names of ten grammarians.{{Sfn|Harold G.

The [[Unadi-sutras]] are thought by some to be anterior to Pāṇini." Also discusses the differences in opinions on interpreting Vedic texts, as given by Aurnabhava, Aupamanyava, Agrayana, Katthakya, Kautsa and Shakapuni – all mentioned as "anterior to Yāska" on p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' 6.1.92, 6.1.123-130, 5.4.112, 8.4.51-67, etc. (annotated in list)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Satkari Mukhopadhyaya |publisher = in ''Encyclopaedia of Indian literature'' v.2, ed.

Some of these pre-Pāṇinian scholars mentioned by Pāṇini include Apisali, Kasyapa, Gargya, Galava, Cakravarmana, Bharadvaja, Sakatayana, Sakalya, Senaka and Sphoṭayāna.{{Sfn|George Cardona|1997|pp=148-157}}&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;

The works of most these authors are lost but we find reference of their ideas in the commentaries and rebuttals by later authors. [[Yāska]]'s ''[[Nirukta]]'' is one of the earlier surviving texts, and he mentions Śākaṭāyana, Krauṣṭuki, Gārgya among others.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Post-Pāṇinian schools===
Pāṇini's ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' is the most ancient extant manuscript on Vyākaraṇa. It is a complete and descriptive treatise on Sanskrit grammar in aphoristic [[sutra]]s format.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=14}}{{Sfn|George Cardona|1997|pp=182-187}} This text attracted a famous and one of the most ancient [[bhāṣya]] (commentary) called the ''Mahābhāṣya''.{{Sfn|George Cardona|1997|pp=243-259}} The author of the ''Mahābhāṣya'' is named Patañjali, who may or may not be the same person as the one who authored the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]''.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=16}} The ''Mahābhāṣya'', literally "great commentary", is more than a commentary on Aṣṭādhyāyī. It is, states Howard Coward, the earliest known philosophical text of the Hindu Grammarians.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=16}}{{refn|group=note|The earliest secondary literature on the primary text of Pāṇini are by Kātyāyana (~3rd century BCE) and Patañjali (~2nd century BCE).{{Sfn|Tibor Kiss|2015|pp=71-72}}}} Non-Hindu texts and traditions on grammar emerged after Patañjali, some of which include the Sanskrit grammar text of Jainendra of Jainism and the Chandra school of Buddhism.{{Sfn|Harold G.

The 5th-century Hindu scholar [[Bhartṛhari]] has been the next most influential Vyākaraṇa thinker, wherein he presented his philosophy of grammar and how language affects thoughts.{{refn|group=note|Bhartṛhari is now dated to have lived no later than the 5th century CE,{{Sfn|Harold G.

Coward|1990|p=18}} Bhartṛhari is considered to be a major architect of the "[[sphoṭa]] theory" of meaning, in the Hindu traditions.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=18}}

Bhartṛhari ideas were widely studied, but challenged as well in the last half of the first millennium, particularly by the ritual-driven, [[Mīmāṃsā]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]] and by [[Dharmakirti]] of [[Buddhism]].{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=18}} The [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism defended the ideas of Bhartṛhari.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=18}}

About the seventh century, the ''Kāśikāvṛttī'' co-authored by Jayaditya and Vamana, and the tenth century studies of Helaraja on Vyākaraṇa were the next major milestone.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=18}} These Hindu texts were not only commented in Hindu tradition, but were the foundation of works of the Buddhist ''Jinendrabuddhi'' who is known for his grammar insights in Buddhist literature.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=18}}

The most studied Vyākaraṇa scholars of early and mid-second millennium are Ksirasvamin, Haradatta, Maitreya Rakshita, and Kaiyata.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|pp=19-20}} The modern era Vyākaraṇa scholars have included Bhattoji Dikshita, Konda Bhatta and Nagesha Bhatta.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=20}}

===Location===
In terms of the place of Vyākaraṇa scholarship over South Asian history, from ancient to 16th-century, Kashmir, Kerala, Nepal, Andhra Pradesh, Varanasi and Bengal have been influential, but the location of many Vyākaraṇa scholars is unknown.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|pp=22-24}}

==Texts==
Pāṇini's text ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' is in sutras format, has eight chapters, and cumulative total of 4,000 sutras.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=14}} These rules are preceded by a list of fourteen groups of sounds, in three sections called the Shiva-sutra, Pratyahara-sutra and Maheshvara-sutra.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=14}}{{Sfn|George Cardona|1997|pp=160-172}} The ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' groups the rules of language, for clear expression and understanding, into two, the verbal (''Dhatupatha'') and the nominal bases (''Ganapatha'').{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|pp=13-14}}{{Sfn|George Cardona|1997|pp=160-172}} The text consists of an analytical part covered in the first five chapters, and a synthetic part found in the last three chapters.{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|1963|pp=460-461}}

The ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' manuscript has survived with sets of ancillary texts (appendices) whose dates of composition and authors are contested.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|pp=14-15}}{{Sfn|George Cardona|1997|pp=179-182}} The main text is notable for its details and systematic nature, syntactic functions and arranging the sutras in an algorithmic fashion where the grammar rules typically apply in the order of sutras.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=15}}

The ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' sutras were widely studied and a subject of the ''bhāṣya'' (review and commentary) tradition of Hinduism. The oldest emendation and commentary on the ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' is attributed to [[Kātyāyana]] (~3rd century BCE), followed by the famous ''Mahābhāṣya'' of Patañjali (~2nd century BCE) which has survived into the modern age.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=16}} Other commentaries on the ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' likely existed, because they are cited by other Indian scholars, but these texts are believed to be lost to history.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=16}}

===Discussion===
Pāṇini writes that the ''Anjna'' (popular usage of a word) is the superseding authority, and the theoretically derived meaning of a word must be discarded and instead superseded by that which is the popular usage.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=111}} The ''artha'' (meaning) of a ''shabda'' (word) is established by popular usage at the time the text was composed, not by etymological theory nor historical usage nor later usage.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|pp=111-112}}

A sentence is a collection of words, a word is a collection of phonemes, states Pāṇini.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=106}} The meaning of Vedic passages has to be understood through context, the purpose stated, keeping in mind the subject matter being discussed, what is stated, how, where and when.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=106}}

The ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' tradition of Sanskrit language, with some reservations, accepts the premise that all words have verbal roots, and that words are created by affixing fragments to these roots.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=112}} However, Pāṇini asserts that it is impossible to derive all nouns from verbal roots.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=112}}

The ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' is primarily focussed on the study of words, how words are formed, and their correct architecture.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=112}} However, it does not exclude syntax. Pāṇini includes the discussion of sentence structure.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=112}} The text, state Howard and Raja, describes compound word formation based on syntactic and semantic considerations, such as in sutra 2.1.1.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=112}}

====What is a correct sentence?====
Pāṇini asserts that a proper sentence has a single purpose, and is formed from a group of words such that, on analysis, the separate words are found to be mutually expecting each other.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=112}} A sentence, states Pāṇini, must have syntactic unity, which includes mutual expectancy (''Akansha'') of the words and phonetic contiguity (''Sannidhi'') of construction. Pāṇini adds semantic fitness (''Yogayata''), but not tacitly. He accepts that a sentence can be grammatically correct even if it is semantically inappropriate or a deviant.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=112}}

====What does a word mean?====
The ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' describes numerous usage of words, and how the meaning of a word is driven by overall context of the sentences and composition it is found in.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=113}} The popular usage and meaning of a word at the time the text was composed supersedes the historical or etymologically derived meanings of that word.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=111}} A word has the conventional meaning at the time the text was composed, but it is not so when it is quoted (cited or referred to) from another prior art text.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=113}} In the latter case, the Sanskrit word is suffixed with ''iti'' (literally, thus), wherein it means what the prior text meant it to be.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=113}}

Yāska asserted that both the meaning and the etymology of words is always context dependent.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=107}}

====Syntax, verbs and words====
Vyākaraṇa in the Hindu traditions has been a study of both the syntax structure of sentences, as well as the architecture of a word. For instance, Pāṇini asserts that grammar is about the means of semantically connecting a word with other words to express and understand meaning, and words are to be analyzed in the context they are used.{{Sfn|Tibor Kiss|2015|pp=73-77}} Kātyāyana is quoted in Patañjali's ''Mahābhāṣya'' on Vyākaraṇa as asserting the nature of a sentence as follows:{{Sfn|Tibor Kiss|2015|p=73}}
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
A sentence consists of a finite verb together with indeclinables, ''karakas'' and qualifiers. – ''Mahābhāṣya'' 1.367.10
A sentence has one finite verb. – ''Mahābhāṣya'' 1.367.16
&lt;/poem&gt;|Kātyāyana{{Sfn|Tibor Kiss|2015|p=73}}}}

Similarly, Sayana asserts the scope of Vyākaraṇa to be as follows:{{Sfn|Tibor Kiss|2015|p=74}}
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Grammar [Vyākaraṇa] is that process by which division is carried out everywhere, by recognizing:
In this speech, so much is one sentence;
In this sentence then, so much is one word;
In this word then, this is the base and this is the suffix.
&lt;/poem&gt;|Sayana{{Sfn|Tibor Kiss|2015|p=74}}}}

A word that is a verb is concerned with ''bhava'' (to become), while a noun is concerned with ''sattva'' (to be, reality as it is).{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=107}} Sattva and bhava are two aspects of the same existence seen from the static and dynamic points of view. Verbs according to Vyākaraṇa indicate action in a temporal sequence while nouns are static elements, states K Kunjunni Raja.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=108}}

===Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya===
Patañjali's 2nd-century BCE ''Mahābhāṣya'' is another important ancient text in Vyākaraṇa scholarship. It not a full commentary on everything Pāṇini wrote in ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'', but it is more a commentary on Kātyāyana's text on grammar called ''Varttikas'',{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|1963|p=465}} as well as the ideas of Vyadi.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=115}} While Kātyāyana's additions have survived, Vyadi have not.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=115}}

The Kātyāyana's text reflects an admiration for Pāṇini, an analysis of his rules, their simplification and refinement.{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|1963|pp=465-466}} The differences between the grammar rules of Pāṇini and of Kātyāyana may be because of historical changes to Sanskrit language over the centuries, state Howard Coward and K Kunjunni Raja.{{Sfn|Harold G.

The ''Vākyapadīya'' of Bhartṛhari is a treatise on the philosophy of language, building on the insights of prior Vyākaraṇa scholarship.{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|1963|pp=474-475}}&lt;ref name="Scharfstein1993p69"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben-Ami Scharfstein|title=Ineffability: The Failure of Words in Philosophy and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tN0KfFitDncC|year=1993|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1347-0|pages=69–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roots of words===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
In Yāska's time, ''nirukta'' "etymology" was in fact a school which gave information of formation of words, the etymological derivation of words. According to the ''nairuktas'' or "etymologists", all nouns are derived from a verbal root. Yāska defends this view and attributes it to Śākaṭāyana. While others believed that there are some words which are "Rudhi Words". 'Rudhi" means custom. Meaning they are a part of language due to custom, and a correspondence between the word and the thing if it be a noun or correspondence between an act and the word if it be a verb root. Such word can not be derived from verbal roots.
Yāska also reports the view of Gārgya, who opposed Śākaṭāyana who held that certain nominal stems were 'atomic' and not to be derived from verbal roots&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| surname1 = Matilal | given1 = Bimal Krishna | origyear = 1990| year = 2001 | title = The word and the world: India's contribution to the study of language | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-565512-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
{{expand section|date=March 2016}}
The Vyākaraṇa texts have been highly influential on Hindu philosophies. The concept of a sentence (''vakya'') defined by Pāṇini, for instance, influenced and was similar to Jaimini, the later era founder of Mīmāṃsā school of [[Hindu philosophy]].{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=112}} However, ritual-focussed Mimamsa school scholars were generally opposed to central ideas of the Hindu Grammarians, while others Hindu schools such as [[Vedanta]] championed them.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=18}}

Pāṇini's work on Vyākaraṇa has been called by George Cardona as "one of the greatest monuments of human intelligence".{{Sfn|George Cardona|1997|p=243}}

{{Linguistics}}
In [[linguistics]], a '''word''' is the smallest element that can be uttered in isolation with [[semantic|objective]] or [[pragmatics|practical]] [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. 

This contrasts deeply with a [[morpheme]], which is the smallest unit of meaning but will not necessarily stand on its own. A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example: ''oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect''), or several (''rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected''), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just mentioned, these are ''-s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed'').
A complex word will typically include a [[root (linguistics)|root]] and one or more [[affix]]es (''rock-s, red-ness, quick-ly, run-ning, un-expect-ed''), or more than one root in a [[compound word|compound]] (''black-board, sand-box''). Words can be put together to build larger elements of [[language]], such as [[phrase]]s (''a red rock'', ''put up with''), [[clause]]s (''I threw a rock''), and [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] (''He threw a rock too, but he missed'').

The term ''word'' may refer to a spoken word or to a written word, or sometimes to the abstract concept behind either.  [[Spoken words]] are made up of units of sound called [[phoneme]]s, and written words of symbols called [[grapheme]]s, such as the letters of the English alphabet.

==Definitions/meanings==
{{further|Lexeme|Lemma (morphology)}}
===Summary===
The difficulty of deciphering a word depends on the language. [[Dictionaries]] categorize a language's [[lexicon]] (i.e., its vocabulary) into [[Lemma (morphology)|lemmas]]. These can be taken as an indication of what constitutes a "word" in the opinion of the writers of that language. The most appropriate means of measuring the length of a word is by counting its [[Syllable|syllables]] or morphemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=John|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Word|date=2015|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a word has multiple definitions or multiple senses, it may result in confusion in a debate or [[discussion]].&lt;ref&gt;Chodorow, Martin S., Roy J. Byrd, and George E. Heidorn. "[https://aclanthology.info/pdf/P/P85/P85-1037.pdf Extracting semantic hierarchies from a large on-line dictionary]." Proceedings of the 23rd annual meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics. Association for Computational Linguistics, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantic definition===
[[Leonard Bloomfield]] introduced the concept of "Minimal Free Forms" in 1926. Words are thought of as the smallest meaningful unit of [[speech]] that can stand by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Katamba 11&lt;/ref&gt; This correlates phonemes (units of sound) to [[lexeme]]s (units of meaning). However, some written words are not minimal free forms as they make no sense by themselves (for example, ''the'' and ''of'').&lt;ref&gt;Fleming 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Some semanticists have put forward a theory of so-called semantic primitives or [[semantic primes]], indefinable words representing fundamental concepts that are intuitively meaningful. According to this theory, semantic primes serve as the basis for describing the meaning, without circularity, of other words and their associated conceptual denotations.&lt;ref name=wierzbicka96&gt;Wierzbicka 1996; Goddard 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features===
In the [[Minimalist program|Minimalist]] school of [[theoretical syntax]], words (also called ''lexical items'' in the literature) are construed as "bundles" of [[feature (linguistics)|linguistic features]] that are united into a structure with form and meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Adger (2003), pp. 36&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the word "koalas" has semantic features (it denotes real-world objects, [[koala]]s), [[Lexical category|category]] features (it is a noun), [[Grammatical number|number]] features (it is plural and must agree with verbs, pronouns, and demonstratives in its domain), [[phonology|phonological]] features (it is pronounced a certain way), etc.

===Word boundaries===
{{cite-section|date=August 2018}}
The task of defining what constitutes a "word" involves determining where one word ends and another word begins&amp;mdash;in other words, identifying word boundaries. There are several ways to determine where the word boundaries of spoken language should be placed:
* '''Potential pause''': A speaker is told to repeat a given sentence slowly, allowing for pauses. The speaker will tend to insert pauses at the word boundaries. However, this method is not foolproof: the speaker could easily break up polysyllabic words, or fail to separate two or more closely linked words (e.g. "to a" in "He went to a house").
* '''Indivisibility''': A speaker is told to say a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] out loud, and then is told to say the sentence again with extra words added to it. Thus, ''I have lived in this village for ten years'' might become ''My family and I have lived in this little village for about ten or so years''. These extra words will tend to be added in the word boundaries of the original sentence. However, some languages have [[infix]]es, which are put inside a word. Similarly, some have [[separable affix]]es; in the [[German language|German]] sentence "Ich '''komme''' gut zu Hause '''an'''", the verb ''ankommen'' is separated.
* '''Phonetic boundaries''': Some languages have particular rules of [[pronunciation]] that make it easy to spot where a word boundary should be. For example, in a language that regularly [[lexical stress|stresses]] the last syllable of a word, a word boundary is likely to fall after each stressed syllable. Another example can be seen in a language that has [[vowel harmony]] (like [[Turkish language|Turkish]]):&lt;ref&gt;Bauer 9&lt;/ref&gt; the vowels within a given word share the same ''quality'', so a word boundary is likely to occur whenever the vowel quality changes. Nevertheless, not all languages have such convenient phonetic rules, and even those that do present the occasional exceptions.
* '''Orthographic boundaries''': See below.

====Orthography====
In languages with a [[writing|literary tradition]], there is interrelation between [[orthography]] and the question of what is considered a single word. [[Word separator]]s (typically [[space (punctuation)|spaces]]) are common in modern orthography of languages using [[alphabetic script]]s, but these are (excepting isolated precedents) a relatively modern development (see also [[history of writing]]).

In [[English orthography]], [[compound (linguistics)|compound expressions]] may contain spaces. For example, ''ice cream'', ''air raid shelter'' and ''get up'' each are generally considered to consist of more than one word (as each of the components are free forms, with the possible exception of ''get'').

Not all languages delimit words expressly. [[Mandarin Chinese]] is a very [[analytic language]] (with few inflectional affixes), making it unnecessary to delimit words orthographically. However, there are many multiple-morpheme compounds in Mandarin, as well as a variety of bound morphemes that make it difficult to clearly determine what constitutes a word.

Sometimes, languages which are extremely close grammatically will consider the same order of words in different ways. For example, [[reflexive verb]]s in the [[French language|French]] infinitive are separate from their respective particle, e.g. ''se laver'' ("to wash oneself"), whereas in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] they are hyphenated, e.g. ''lavar-se'', and in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] they are joined, e.g. ''lavarse''.&lt;ref&gt;Note that the convention also depends on the tense or mood—the examples given here are in the infinitive, whereas French imperatives, for example, are hyphenated, e.g. ''lavez-vous'', whereas the Spanish present tense is completely separate, e.g. ''me lavo''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Japanese language|Japanese]] uses orthographic cues to delimit words such as switching between [[kanji]] (Chinese characters) and the two [[kana]] syllabaries. This is a fairly soft rule, because [[content word]]s can also be written in [[hiragana]] for effect (though if done extensively spaces are typically added to maintain legibility).

[[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] orthography, although using the [[Latin alphabet]], delimits monosyllabic morphemes rather than words.

In [[character encoding]], [[text segmentation#Word segmentation|word segmentation]] depends on which [[character (computing)|characters]] are defined as word dividers.

==Morphology==
{{main|Morphology (linguistics)}}
{{further|Inflection}}
[[File:Happy Valentines Day.jpg|thumbnail|Letters and words]]
Morphology is the study of word formation and structure. In [[synthetic language]]s, a single [[word stem]] (for example, ''love'') may have a number of different forms (for example, ''loves'', ''loving'', and ''loved''). However, for some purposes these are not usually considered to be different words, but rather different forms of the same word. In these languages, words may be considered to be constructed from a number of [[morpheme]]s.

In [[Indo-European languages]] in particular, the morphemes distinguished are
* The [[root (linguistics)|root]]. 
* Optional [[suffixes]].
* A inflectional [[suffix]].
Thus, the Proto-Indo-European ''{{PIE|*wr̥dhom}}'' would be analyzed as consisting of
# ''{{PIE|*wr̥-}}'', the [[zero grade]] of the root ''{{PIE|*wer-}}''.
# A root-extension ''{{PIE|*-dh-}}'' (diachronically a suffix), resulting in a complex root ''{{PIE|*wr̥dh-}}''.
# The [[thematic suffix]] ''{{PIE|*-o-}}''.
# The [[neuter gender]] nominative or accusative singular suffix ''{{PIE|*-m}}''.

==Philosophy==
Philosophers have found words objects of fascination since at least the 5th century BC, with the foundation of the [[philosophy of language]]. [[Plato]] analyzed words in terms of their origins and the sounds making them up, concluding that there was some connection between sound and meaning, though words change a great deal over time. [[John Locke]] wrote that the use of words "is to be sensible marks of ideas", though they are chosen "not by any natural connexion that there is between particular articulate sounds and certain ideas, for then there would be but one language amongst all men; but by a voluntary imposition, whereby such a word is made arbitrarily the mark of such an idea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/philos/classics/locke/ctb3c02.htm |title=Locke ECHU BOOK III Chapter II Of the Signification of Words |publisher=Rbjones.com |date= |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wittgenstein]]'s thought transitioned from a word as representation of meaning to "the meaning of a word is its use in the language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein |title=Ludwig Wittgenstein (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeology shows that even for centuries prior to this fascination by philosophers in the 5th century BC, many languages had various ways of expressing this verbal unit, which in turn diversified and evolved into a range of expressions with wide philosophical significance.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Ancient manuscripts of the [[Gospel of John]] reveal in its 5th chapter the Rabonni Y'shua chastising the pharisees expecting to find life in writings instead of himself. This perhaps could have led to John's introduction in chapter of a description in the Greek translation as "the logos".{{clarify|date=February 2015}}  A famous early scientist, scholar and priest, [[Thomas Aquinas]], influenced [[Cartesian philosophy]] and mathematics by interpreting such passages consistently with his philosophy of logic.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Classes==
{{main|Lexical category}}
[[Grammar]] classifies a language's lexicon into several groups of words. The basic bipartite division possible for virtually every [[natural language]] is that of [[noun]]s vs. [[verb]]s.

The classification into such classes is in the tradition of [[Dionysius Thrax]], who distinguished eight categories: [[noun]], [[verb]], [[adjective]], [[pronoun]], [[preposition]], [[adverb]], [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] and [[interjection]].

In Indian grammatical tradition, [[Pāṇini]] introduced a similar fundamental classification into a nominal (nāma, suP) and a verbal (ākhyāta, tiN) class, based on the set of [[suffixes]] taken by the word. Some words can be controversial such as slang in formal contexts, misnomers due to them not meaning what they would imply or polysemous words due to the potential confusion of its multiple senses.&lt;ref&gt;De Soto, Clinton B., Margaret M. Hamilton, and Ralph B. Taylor. "Words, people, and implicit personality theory." Social Cognition 3.4 (1985): 369-382&lt;/ref&gt;
