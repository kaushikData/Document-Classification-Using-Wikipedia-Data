'''Aesymnetes''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|αἰσυμνήτης}}, from {{lang|grc|αἶσα}}, ''aisa'', a "just portion", hence "a person who gives everyone their just portion") was the name of an ancient Greek elected office similar to, and sometimes indistinguishable from, [[tyrant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

The title originally signified merely a judge in the heroic games, but afterwards indicated an individual who was occasionally invested voluntarily by his fellow citizens with essentially unlimited power in a Greek state.  [[Aristotle]] called the office an "elective tyranny", and said that the power of the ''aesymnetai'' partook in some degree of the nature "both of kingly and tyrannical authority; since he was appointed legally and ruled over willing subjects, but at the same time was not bound by any laws in his public administration."&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]] iii. 9. § 5, iv. 8. § 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hesych. ''s. v.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence [[Theophrastus]] calls the office {{lang|grc|τυραννίς αιρετή}} ("elective tyranny"), and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] compares it with the [[dictator]]ship at Rome.&lt;ref name="dionysius"&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], v. 73&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not hereditary; but it was sometimes held for life, and at other times only until some object was accomplished, such as the reconciling of the various factions in the state.  There is only one recorded instant of a person expressly receiving the title of ''Aesymnetes'': [[Pittacus of Mytilene|Pittacus]], in [[Mytilene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; who was appointed to this dignity because the state had been long torn asunder by the various factions, and who succeeded in restoring peace and order by his wise regulations and laws.&lt;ref name="dionysius"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], xiii. p. 617&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Solon]]'' 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], i. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plehn, ''Lesbiaca'', pp. 4 6,48&lt;/ref&gt;

There were, however, no doubt many other persons who ruled under this title for a while in the various states of Greece, and those law-givers bore a strong resemblance to the ''aesymnetai'', whom their fellow citizens appointed with supreme power to enact laws, as [[Draco (lawgiver)|Dracon]], [[Solon]], [[Zaleucus]] and [[Charondas]].  In some states, such as [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Cyme]] and [[Chalcedon]], it was the title borne by the regular [[magistrate]]s.

According to Aristotle, the office fell into disuse due to the risk of those who would not willingly relinquish the office, and the Greek States allowed it to disappear altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' 1285a, 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Art of the Umbrella movement''' refers to artistic works created as part of the [[Umbrella movement]] in Hong Kong which demanded democracy in the election of the territory's top leader. Most of the physical works of art are located within the three main protest sites of [[Umbrella Square|Admiralty]], [[Causeway Bay]] and [[Mong Kok]], some concepts have originated from outside Hong Kong.

Art is often held to be an integral part of activism. For the students involved in the "[[2014 Hong Kong protests|Umbrella Revolution]]", their art is a primary vehicle of expression and a method of documenting what occurs.&lt;ref name=JournalSentinel&gt;{{cite news |first=Mary Louise |last=Schumacher |date=6 November 2014 |title=The enchanting art of Hong Kong's Umbrella Revolution |url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/arts/the-enchanting-art-of-hong-kongs-umbrella-revolution-b99385524z1-281848021.html |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |accessdate=7 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the umbrella – an everyday item that protects users against the rain and the sun – by the protesters to deflect pepper spray and tear gas of the police&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://disizart.com/products/wall-prints-black-and-white-art|title=Hong Kong Police Man Stance {{!}} Wall Art Decor {{!}} Taken during the Umbrella Movement Protests in Hong Kong|last=Disizart|website=''Disizart.com''|access-date=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, has given the object iconic status at a political level, symbolising resistance and the underlying social grievances.&lt;ref name=JournalSentinel/&gt;&lt;ref name=20141009fpol&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/10/09/hong_kong_protest_art|title=Hong Kong's Wild Protest Art|work=Foreign Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20141007WaPo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/10/07/photos-the-colorful-world-of-hong-kongs-protest-art/|title=Photos: The colorful world of Hong Kong’s protest art|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The occupied streets of Hong Kong have been transformed into an extended canvas of artistic creativity.&lt;ref name=20141008CNNprotestart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/08/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-art/|title=Street becomes canvas for 'silent protest' in Hong Kong|author=Ivan Watson, Pamela Boykoff and Vivian Kam|date=8 October 2014|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iconography ==
As an everyday item that protects users against the rain and the sun, the umbrella has, in the past, symbolised political weakness. In the context of the Hong Kong protests, it has been used to shield against the pepper spray and tear gas of the police, thus has become a political symbol of resistance.&lt;ref name=JournalSentinel/&gt;&lt;ref name=20141009fpol/&gt;&lt;ref name=20141007WaPo/&gt;&lt;ref name=20141001WSJcrt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/10/01/hong-kong-protests-mark-twist-in-history-of-umbrella-symbolism/?mod=blog_flyover|title=Hong Kong Protests Mark Twist in History of Umbrella Symbolism|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20140930cnn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/30/world/asia/objects-hong-kong-protest/|title=The symbols of Hong Kong's 'Umbrella Revolution' |author=Tim Hume and Madison Park|date=30 September 2014|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical umbrellas in all their guises have been used as subjects or as objects.&lt;ref name=20141116bostonglobe/&gt; The eight-lane expanse of road freed by the occupation has been transformed into an extended canvas for artistic expression.&lt;ref name=bbc29648459/&gt;&lt;ref name=20141115NYTjoyce/&gt;&lt;ref name=quartz279221&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/279221/someone-should-preserve-hong-kongs-protest-art-before-its-too-late/|title=Someone should preserve Hong Kong's protest art before it's too late|author=Heather Timmons|work=Quartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; One artist explained that due to the lack of physical public space in Hong Kong, people's imagination is suppressed. She added that: "When the rules that bind your action are suddenly lifted, you are given the freedom to redefine everything." Artwork featuring the form of umbrellas are in abundance.&lt;ref name=20141006scmp/&gt; Examples of works include umbrellas drawn on or decorated with calligraphy, balloon twisting into umbrellas, and mobiles of origami umbrellas.&lt;ref name=20141116bostonglobe/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc29648459/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/new/20141026/494809/|title=佔中巧手扭出黃雨傘　嚴選「外國勢力」氣球|work=Apple Daily |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colette Gaiter, an Associate Professor of Art at the University of Delaware, praised the quality of the artwork as possessing "an elevated aesthetic sensibility even in the ubiquitous handwritten signs and Post-it notes".&lt;ref name=20141007WaPo/&gt;

''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The competition aims to elevate awareness and generate more concern for the demand for "real universal suffrage" for Hong Kong. Wong said that use of social media such as Facebook allows for the creation of a "safe platform" for universal participation, which in turn generates awareness.&lt;ref name=artnet121249/&gt; Among the entries is one created by international street artist [[Invader (artist)|Invader]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt;

The [[yellow ribbon]], which has been used to represent women's suffrage, was adopted early by the movement.&lt;ref name=20140930cnn/&gt; Activists adorned street railings and barricades with these, pinned them on shirts, and used them on Facebook profiles.&lt;ref name=20140930cnn/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc29407067/&gt; Use of the symbolic yellow crossed over into the umbrellas.&lt;ref name=20141115NYTjoyce/&gt;&lt;ref name=baptistgrad/&gt;

Opening up yellow umbrellas indoors, as well as outdoors, has also become a way of sending in pro-democracy message in silence. [[Paul Zimmerman (politician)|Paul Zimmerman]], a district councillor and member of the [[Civic Party]], was an early proponent.

== Installations ==
A number of installations and sculptures were created at occupation sites, of which one of the largest is a patchwork hanging in the middle of [[Umbrella Square]] made of fabric taken from more than a hundred broken umbrellas which were sewn together.&lt;ref name=20141116bostonglobe/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc29648459&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-29648459|title=In pictures: Hong Kong protest art|work=''BBC News''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, Mary Louise (6 November 2014).

''Journal Sentinel'' (Milwaukee).&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was developed by Baptist University art students, to bolster the movement in the early days. A group of about ten other students stripped the fabric from umbrellas that were broken and had been stained by tear gas in the police bombardment of 28 September, and wove them together and deployed it above what is now referred to as "Umbrella Square". Tse, the project leader, hoped that the umbrellas broken by the police, fashioned into canopy, symbolises an extended physical protection for citizens that also serves as a reminder of the presence of other citizens who are behind to support, in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;See AJ+ video&lt;/ref&gt; At Admiralty, large yellow umbrellas have been installed at many lamp posts; ''Happy Gadfly'' concept by mainland artist Miso Zo inspired by ''The Gadfly'', by [[Ethel Lilian Voynich]].

The [[Lennon Wall Hong Kong|Lennon Wall,]] a namesake of [[Lennon Wall|the one in Prague]], is a stretch of curved staircase in the Central Government Complex that has been covered in multi-coloured handwritten Post-it notes from supporters.&lt;ref name="20141115NYTjoyce" /&gt;&lt;ref name="quartz279221" /&gt;&lt;ref name="channelfour28255" /&gt; The messages, written mainly in Chinese and English but also other languages, include calls for genuine democracy, for [[Leung Chun-ying|CY Leung]] to step down as Chief executive, words of encouragement, and praise for the peacefulness of the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-29479338|title=Hong Kong protests: Pleas from the protest wall|work=''BBC News''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Stand By You: 'Add Oil' Machine" ===
An art collective called "Stand By You: 'Add Oil' Machine" launched a project that aimed to display messages of support to protesters. The name refers to "[[add oil]]", a term of encouragement in Chinese. The project included a website where people from all over the world could send messages, which in turn were projected onto the side of a building.&lt;ref name="20140930chinarealtime"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/09/30/hong-kong-protests-inspire-creations-from-citys-artistic-community/|title=Hong Kong Protests Inspire Creations From City's Artistic Community|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 30,000 messages have been received by the project from 70 countries.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; The "Stand by You" project received messages of support from, among others, [[Pussy riot]] and [[Peter Gabriel]], all of whom were photographed with open umbrellas.

== Vernacular ==
The existence of homophones in Chinese language allows great potential for wordplay that replacing characters with similar tones, or pitch patterns can effect significant changes in meaning.&lt;ref name=gma391168&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/391168/lifestyle/peopleandevents/fun-with-puns-umbrella-terms-a-new-weapon-in-hong-kong-democracy-battle|title=Fun with puns: ‘Umbrella Terms’ a new weapon in Hong Kong democracy battle|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20141128guardian/&gt; Although Chinese is full of idioms, popular sayings, customs, jokes that rely on wordplay, the Beijing leadership has imposed a ban on wordplay in broadcasting as such use ostensibly breaches the law on spoken and written Chinese. Critics believe the ban is aimed at making it illegal to criticise the leadership and/or its policies in veiled manner, whilst avoiding censorship.&lt;ref name=20141128guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/28/china-media-watchdog-bans-wordplay-puns|title=China bans wordplay in attempt at pun control|author=Tania Branigan|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics have noted that the protests have resulted in the unprecedented creation of new Cantonese terms that contain political puns and special idioms. There has also been a resurgence in Cantonese usage, countering the trend imposed by Beijing to expand use of [[Standard Chinese]] (aka Mandarin or Putonghua) in the place of "dialects", which is defined to include [[Cantonese]].&lt;ref name="gma391168" /&gt;

The new lexicon of protest incorporates the term "left plastic" (左膠), a derogative term used by radicals to refer to "leftists/moderates".&lt;ref name=quartz292835&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/292835/hong-kongs-umbrella-movement-is-starting-to-splinter/|title=Hong Kong's Umbrella Movement is starting to splinter|author=Lily Kuo|work=Quartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also "[[gau wu]]" (鳩嗚), a vulgar homophone of a term in Mandarin which means "to shop" (購物) – the character substitution transforms the original meaning into "to occupy the streets in protest".

The encampments are referred to as "villages", road signs have been changed pointing to social change; occupiers' flimsy tents have often been given grandiose addresses such as "Umbrella Court" or "Democracy Gardens", parodying names given to luxury property developments in an increasingly unaffordable city.&lt;ref name="gma391168" /&gt;

A glossary of the terms affiliated with the Umbrella Movement protests was created online, at umbrellaterms.hk.&lt;ref name="gma391168" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1477">'''Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana'''  (price difference payment scheme)  is a scheme of the [[Government of Madhya Pradesh]]   whereby the government pays farmers the difference between official  [[Minimum Support Price]] (MSP) and the rate at which they sell their crops  or Model Price whichever is higher.&lt;ref name="LiveMint"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bera |first1=Sayantan |title=Madhya Pradesh launches new farm scheme to hedge price risks in farming |url=https://www.livemint.com/Politics/uDdclMv4VKUhGvpSEqtmqL/Madhya-Pradesh-launches-new-farm-scheme-to-hedge-price-risks.html |accessdate=12 August 2018 |work=LiveMint |date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of the scheme is to provide the compensation to farmers for agriculture products whenever its price fall below the announced Minimum support price (MSP) and thereby protecting them from losses suffered on account of distress sale.

The scheme was launched by the chief minister [[Shivraj Singh]] on 16 October 2017.The state government in first year introduced the scheme for eight crops mainly in the oilseeds and pulses category. Later in 2018 the scheme was extended to total 13 Kharif crops.

A '''Blue–green alliance''' describes either an [[wiktionary:alliance|alliance]] or [[coalition government|coalition]] between "blue" [[conservatism|conservative parties]] and [[green parties]], or "blue" labor organizations, such as [[labor unions]], and [[environmental organizations]] such as green parties. "Blue-Green" can also refer to a [[Right-wing|right]]-tendency within green parties based around [[green conservatism]].

==Canada==
The [[Green Party of Ontario]] and to a lesser extent, the [[Green Party of Canada]] are considered "blue–green" because they are more economically centrist or agree with part of [[green conservatism]]. They have some cooperation with the [[Conservative Party of Canada]].

==Czech Republic==
The [[Mirek Topolánek's Second Cabinet|Second Cabinet]] of Prime Minister [[Mirek Topolánek]], member of the liberal-conservative [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]], included the Czech [[Green Party (Czech Republic)|Green Party]].

==Finland==
Several governments of Finland have included both the liberal-conservative [[National Coalition Party]] and the [[Green League]], including the [[Jyrki Katainen's cabinet|cabinet]] of Prime Minister [[Jyrki Katainen]].

==Germany==
In Germany, it refers to the conservative [[CDU/CSU]] and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens]]. The two parties have several coalition governments at state levels.

==Ireland==
On 13 June 2007, following the [[Irish general election, 2007|2007 general election]], the Irish [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] became a minor coalition partner to the conservative [[Fianna Fáil]] and the (now-defunct) liberal [[Progressive Democrats]], entering government for the first time in the Greens' history. The Green Party remained a coalition partner until the [[Irish general election, 2011|2011 general election]], when the Greens lost their representation in the [[Dáil Éireann]].

The blue-green alliance also refer to the conservative [[Fianna Fáil]] (green) and the liberal-conservative [[Fine Gael]] (blue), though both parties are rivals and unlikely to form coalitions. After the [[Irish general election, 2016|2016 general election]], Fianna Fáil agreed to support a Fine Gael-led minority government.

==Latvia==
The [[Latvian Green Party]] (LZP) has been a component of centre-right coalition governments in Latvia from 1993–1998 and 2002–present, with LZP member [[Indulis Emsis]] serving as [[Prime Minister of Latvia]] from March to December 2004. Since 2002 the LZP has been part of the [[Union of Greens and Farmers]] political and electoral alliance with the agrarian-conservative [[Latvian Farmers' Union]].

==Mexico==
The conservative [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] ''(Partido Acción Nacional,'' or PAN), and the [[Green Ecological Party of Mexico]] ''(Partido Verde Ecologista de México,'' or PVEM) formed coalition of [[Alliance for Change (Mexico)|Alliance for Change]] in 2000 in order to win the [[Mexican general election, 2000|general elections]]. The coalition dissolved in 2001.

==New Zealand==
The now defunct [[Progressive Green Party (New Zealand)|Progressive Green Party]] was a political group with a strong environmental focus. It was closely aligned with the centre-right [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]. The "blue–green" Progressive Greens were contrasted with the better-known "red–green" [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]], which generally takes a left-wing position. (A third group, the [[Green Society]], rejected both "blue–green" and "red–green" politics.)

==Taiwan==
[[Pan-Blue Coalition]] (led by the [[Kuomintang]], KMT) and [[Pan-Green Coalition]] (led by the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], DPP), which refer to political constellations in [[Taiwan]], the colours here have different meanings and it is unlikely that the two parties would form a coalition in both national and local levels. The two parties formed a [[grand coalition]] government in 2000 during the first 4 months of [[Chen Shui-bian]] presidency, as Chen-led DPP did not have the majority in the [[Legislative Yuan]], which the KMT had majority. After the dissolve of grand coalition, President Chen indeed led a [[minority government]] for the rest of his terms.

==United Kingdom==
In the context of United Kingdom politics, it refers to a possible alliance on certain issues between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and ecologists or environmentalists such as those found in the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]]. This alliance may occur as a result of the Conservative view that [[market economy|market economics]] help preserve the environment and a tendency toward [[Deep England]] views of pastoralism, and the Green view that [[Profit (economics)|profit]] is not anywhere near as much of a threat to natural systems as [[debt]]. However, the UK's various green parties are usually considered to be leftist greens, and coalitions with the Conservatives such as on [[Leeds City Council]] have proved unpopular with the party's membership and voters.

==United States==
In the context of the politics of the United States, as blue refers to the left-leaning [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], the term refers to alliances between [[trade union|organized labor]] and [[environmental movement|environmentalists]], and sometimes specifically to cooperation between [[Green Party (United States)|American Greens]] and [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] labor activists. The core issue of this alliance is opposition to [[globalization]] and to [[free trade]], and it was significant in the candidacy of [[Ralph Nader]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], as Nader was endorsed by some labor organizations (the overwhelming majority of labor unions and environmental organizations are loyal to the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and endorsed [[Al Gore]]).

It also continues to be used more generally to refer to any efforts at coalition-building between environmentalists and labor, as with the famous "teamsters and turtles" politics of the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO Meeting of 1999]] and the continuing [[anti-globalization movement]]. Journalist Sue Ellen White coined the term "turtles and teamsters" in a December 2, 1999 article, "Turtles and Teamsters United Against Patents on Life," written on the scene from the newly formed [[Independent Media Center|Independent Media Center (Indymedia)]].

The BlueGreen Alliance (BGA) is a national nonprofit partnership of environmental groups and labor unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2013/02/issues-and-interest-groups-in-state-of-the-union-spotlight/

Other related organizations include the Alliance for Sustainable Jobs and the Environment and the [[Apollo Alliance]], a subsidiary of the Blue Green Alliance that promotes green jobs based on [[alternative energy]].

==Partner organizations==
The [[Emerald Cities Collaborative]] is a partner organization with the Blue–green alliance.

'''Christians Against the Coup''' (CAC), aka '''Anti-Coup Christians''', is an [[Egypt]]ian Christian [[Political movement|movement]], founded after the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|coup d'état on July 2013]] in support of the presumed legitimacy of the former President of Egypt, [[Mohamed Morsi]].

== Foundation ==

[[File:R4BIA Christian Supporters.svg|thumb|250px|right|Variation of [[Rabia sign]] showing solidarity of Egyptian Christians with the numerous victims of [[August 2013 Cairo sit-ins dispersal|pro-Morsi sit-ins dispersal]], and hence showing their opposition to the recent [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|coup d'état in Egypt]].]]

The Egyptian Christian journalist and activist Ramy Jan founded Christians Against the Coup movement after then-[[General officer|General]] [[El-Sisi]] ([[Field Marshal]] since January 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-28/egypt27s-military-council-meets-to-decide-sisi27s-political-a/5221486|title=Egypt's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi receives a promotion ahead of likely presidency bid|date=18 February 2014|accessdate=27 January 2014|work=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;) declared ouster of President [[Morsi]] on July 3, 2013, claiming that he had taken this critical decision in response to large anti-Morsi protests which were held in many parts of [[Egypt]], June 30, which demanded early presidential elections. Pro-Morsi protests, however, were held as well few days before then. The movement states that its members, who are solely [[Christian]]s, still support Morsi, and that there had been no sectarian violence against the Christian minority in Egypt in the one-year reign of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. The movement adopts the belief that violence against Christians was either individually-based, or rather fabricated. On the other hand, 'June-30' protesters, as being called in the local media, expressed that Morsi encouraged violence against non-[[Muslim]]s; hence the motto of the CAC, ''′The matter is not about the Brotherhood; it is rather about the dishonoured people.′''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/09/30/326792/christians-form-new-movement-against-morsis-ouster/|title=Christians form new movement against Morsi’s ouster|work=Press TV|date=30 September 2013|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accusations were made against the movement, the most common of which is the belonging to the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. The CAC assures that its members do not belong to any political stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=31308|title=Christians Against The Coup: Christians Suffered No Violation During Brotherhood Rule|work=Ikhwan Web|date=14 September 2013|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like many other anti-coup movements, the CAC works alongside the [[Anti-Coup Alliance]], where the latter represents the broadest anti-coup assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rassd.com/7-80264.htm|title=Ramy Jan to Rassd: ′Alongside peacefulness, there must be escalation and sharp tone.′ |work=Rassd News Network|date=10 January 2014|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goal ==

The movement declared the aim of re-establishing the legitimacy awarded to President Morsi through the elections/referendums held in the past two years. The movement also aims to rewind the coup, cancel all its traces, and put [[Field Marshal]] [[El-Sisi]], military officers of the [[SCAF]], senior police officers and others to trial.

Jan, the founder, describes the idea of the movement by comparing it to the role the Coptic leader [[Makram Ebeid]] (1879–1961) played at the time of [[Hassan al-Banna]] (1906–1949), the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood. Ebeid denied accusations of terrorism that were made against al-Banna. He also took part in al-Banna's burial, defying strict measures imposed on taking part in it. Today, the movement plays the same role Ebeid played: defending the Brotherhood against accusations of terrorism, and standing in support of Mohamed Morsi, who is accused of treason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/africa/7562-coptic-activist-large-number-of-christians-refuse-the-coup|title=Coptic activist: Large number of Christians reject the coup|work=Middle East Monitor|date=27 September 2013|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In late 2013, a minor controversy occurred when it was revealed that founder Ramy Jan was also a member of the Egyptian Nazi Party. This disclosure led to the cancellation of Jan's invitation to a conference at [[Georgetown University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/egyptian-nazi-will-no-longer-participate-at-georgetown-conference/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0 Egyptian Nazi Will No Longer Participate at Georgetown Conference] By Liam Stack, ''[[New York Times]]'',  November 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-12-03/florida-jewish-journal/fl-jjps-cohen-1204-20131203_1_nazis-conference-organizers-golden-dawn Egyptian Nazi scandal exposes academic dishonesty] by Ben Cohen, ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'', December 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehoya.com/news/acmcu-event-postponed-after-egyptian-nazi-accidentally-invited-1.3123895 ACMCU Event Postponed After Egyptian Nazi Accidentally Invited] by Kayla Cross, ''[[The Hoya]]'', November 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/georgetown-u-disinvites-egyptian-nazi-from-conference/69469 Georgetown U.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1799">'''Cultured dextrose''' is a [[food additive]] used to inhibit the growth of undesirable bacteria and mold in food. Often used in place of [[Sodium benzoate|benzoates]] and [[Potassium sorbate|sorbates]], it is considered by some consumers to be a more "natural" ingredient, because it is prepared by the fermentation of milk or sugar powders by the supposedly [[probiotic]] bacteria [[Propionibacterium freudenreichii]] and [[Lactococcus lactis]], both of which are extensively used in the production of cheese and other dairy products.&lt;ref name="ntfs"&gt;L. McIntyre et al., in [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xa4KxpujNLUC&amp;pg=PA193#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Novel Technologies in Food Science] (Springer, 2012), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultured dextrose consists of an undefined mixture of fermentation metabolites, including butyric, propionic and lactic acids and small [[peptides]].   As sold, it is an off-white powder.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Mayweather, [http://www.livestrong.com/article/549933-what-is-cultured-dextrose/ "What is Cultured Dextrose"], Livestrong.com, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultured dextrose is marketed under several trade names including bioVONTAGE from Third Wave Bioactives as well as MicroGARD® by [[Danisco]], a unit of [[DuPont]].  These ingredients are used in a range of foods including dairy products, salad dressings, and baked goods.&lt;ref name="ntfs" /&gt;

'''Democratic Malaysian Indian Party''' (DMIP) or {{lang-ms|Parti Demokratik India Malaysia}} was a splinter party of [[Malaysian Indian Congress]] (MIC) formed on 19 Oktober 1985 to represent the minority India community by Datuk V. Govindaraj, an ex-Vice President of MIC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=LclscNCTz9oC&amp;pg=PA797&amp;lpg=PA797&amp;dq=Democratic+Malaysian+Indian+Party&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ym4pWc1b37&amp;sig=A7IneLixCTixMrvVi0E7D8n4mSg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Democratic%20Malaysian%20Indian%20Party&amp;f=false |title=The Far East and Australasia 2003 |page =797 |date =|author=By Eur|work=Google eBookstore|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=D6mFCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA580&amp;lpg=PA580&amp;dq=Democratic+Malaysian+Indian+Party&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TN-e9qgdUJ&amp;sig=qpVq9GaJ8s6MTJsN9TlqNtXUsmc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Democratic%20Malaysian%20Indian%20Party&amp;f=false |title=Political Handbook of the World 1998 |page =580 |date =|author1=Arthur S.

Although the struggle of DMIP for than ten years has failed to join [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) causing it to be disbanded by its founder and president, Datuk V. Govindaraj who went back to be with MIC and was selected again as CWC member of MIC in 1997 but was dropped at last by Datuk Seri [[S. Samy Vellu]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianmalaysian.com/sound/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=172 Govindaray cries foul over sacking as CWC member, 30 Mei 2006, Bernama]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippine '''Department of Agriculture CALABARZON''' (abbreviated as '''DA CALABARZON''') is a Regional Field Office under the [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]] responsible for the promotion of agriculture and fisheries in the region of [[Calabarzon|CALABARZON]]; covering the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon.&lt;ref name="CALABARZON Profile"&gt;{{cite web|title= Regional Profile - CALABARZON|url= http://rfo4a.da.gov.ph/index.php/profile-4a|accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters is currently situated at RMIC Bldg., BPI Compound, Visayas Ave, [[Quezon City]].

The department was created through Executive Order No. 103 in 2002.&lt;ref name="DA CALABARZON Creation"&gt;{{cite web|title= Executive Order No. 103, s. 2002|url= http://www.gov.ph/2002/05/17/executive-order-no-103-s-2002|accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regional Field Unit is currently being led by Regional Executive Director Arnel de Mesa.

==Organizational structure==
The Department is headed by the [[Regional Executive Director]], with the following offices under the regional field unit:
*Office of the Regional Executive Director (ORED)
*Office of the Regional Technical Director for Operations and Extension (ORTDOE)
*Office of the Regional Technical Director for Research and Regulatory
*Administrative Office
*Operations
*Regulatory
*Regional Agricultural Engineering Division (RAED)
*Agribusiness &amp; Marketing Assistance Division (AMAD)
*Regional Agriculture and Fisheries Information Division (RAFID)

==Priority Programs==

The Department of Agriculture - CALABARZON currently has five priority programs for the region.

'''Rice Program''' - The purpose of the Rice Program is to integrate the government interventions and initiatives for rice farming and the agriculture sector, namely: food security and sufficiency, support services from farm to table, sustainable resource management, and broad-based local partnerships. These are achieved through various intervention services like production support; irrigation development; market development; other infrastructure and post harvest development; research and development; regulatory services; and extension support, education and training services.

'''Corn Program''' - Various groups depend on corn as a major source of livelihood. These includes farm households who uses corn for livestock mixed feeds, transport services, traders, processors, and agricultural input suppliers who directly benefit from the corn production, processing, marketing, and distribution. Corn can also be processed into high value products like corn syrup, cornstarch, and snack foods. The Corn Program aims to increase the income of those relying on corn as a major source of livelihood by introducing various initiatives and intervention services.

'''High Value Crops Development Program''' - The HVCDP is a priority program that aims to promote the production processing, marketing, and distribution of high value crops. The program also aims to increase the income of the producers, create livelihood opportunities for the people, and contribute to the country's national agricultural development.

'''Livestock Program''' - With many of the region's top agricultural commodities coming from the livestock sector, the Livestock Program is one of the priority programs of DA CALABARZON. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystat.psa.gov.ph/?cont=16&amp;r=4|title=Regional Profile: CALABARZON |accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program aims to accelerate the development of the poultry and livestock sector by improving its production and increasing the stakeholders' profitability; leading to livestock industry to be seen as an agribusiness venture anchored on food security and farmers profitability.

'''Organic Agriculture Program''' - The program was created to promote organic agriculture by providing various initiatives and interventions such as production support services, like distribution of organic fertilizer and establishment of vermisheds for [[vermicompost]]; and market development services like conducting of market forums, trade fairs, and organic market days, to name a few.

  -- PLEASE DO NOT WANTONLY INSERT THE WORD "CULT" HERE --
"Cult" is a flexible term and should be used with care. Destiny's control of its members, and the concerns raised by this are discussed in the article and in the attached references. Labelling Destiny as a "cult" without supporting evidence is not helpful, we're attempting to write from a NEUTRAL point of view. See WP:POV and WP:Soapbox. The section on the new "Oath of Allegiance" now mentions the Cult label used in the media.

The church advocates strict adherence to [[biblical morality]], and has a reputation for its position against [[homosexuality]], for its [[patriarchal]] views and for its calls for a return to [[Conservative Christianity (disambiguation) | biblical conservative]] [[family values]] and morals. It also teaches [[prosperity theology]].&lt;ref&gt;Grimshaw, Mike (January 2006).

Led by [[Brian Tamaki]], a [[charisma]]tic orator whose actions and rhetoric have attracted criticism from the New Zealand media and from other public figures, Destiny Church has sponsored a nationwide rally against [[civil union]]s, issued a [[DVD]] which labels the [[Government of New Zealand]] as "evil", ordained Tamaki as [[bishop]] over all local Destiny churches, and held a gathering of 700 men who swore a [[covenant (disambiguation) | "covenant"]]&lt;ref name="Covenant Document"&gt;

==Organization==
===Leadership===
[[File:Bishop-Tamaki-Auckland-2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Brian Tamaki at a church conference in [[Auckland]] (22 October 2006)]]
Destiny Church is led by Bishop [[Brian Tamaki]] and his wife Hannah Tamaki, who hold the positions of Visionary and Senior Ministers. Their three adult children Jasmine, Jamie, and Samuel also hold leadership positions in the Auckland church.&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=https://www.destinychurch.org.nz/about-us|publisher=Destiny Church New Zealand|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a unanimous agreement by the 19 other pastors of Destiny Churches throughout New Zealand, Tamaki was ordained as a [[bishop]] during a ceremony performed by [[kaumatua]] and Destiny Pastor&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10424770&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel Renata on 18 June 2005.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10331506"/&gt;

The church's leadership demand strict obedience to its teachings&lt;ref&gt;"Cultism in religion rings the alarm bells", NZ Herald, 13 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and its rhetoric has alienated other churches that have different approaches to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.challengeweekly.co.nz/stories/~d//post/Vol-62-Issue-No-25/id/94/ Enough is Enough]". ''Challenge Weekly'', Vol. 62 Issue 25, July 2004
{{cquote|''VISION Network, which represents a large number of churches, says that although they were supportive of the general message of Destiny Church’s "Enough" campaign, response from its Advisory Board had overwhelmingly indicated that they preferred to see this issue handled differently ... "The difficulty is that when any individual or group calls for unity on a single issue, but operates outside of a wider unity movement that others have committed to, it is more likely to create division rather than the unity which is sought"''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Tamaki, in what he described as a prophetic utterance, predicted that Destiny would be "ruling the nation" within five years.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_451171"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_national_story_skin/451171?format=html |title=Is Destiny destined to rule? |date=3 October 2004 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614123253/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_national_story_skin/451171?format=html |archivedate=14 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VbSE3VKn8c&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministry===
The church provides not only religious guidance but also a range of social services including budget advice, support for drug addicts and provision of food and housing. The church also operates a composite school (catering for both primary and secondary students) which uses the Cambridge system.&lt;ref&gt;{{TKI|1655|Destiny School}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church services have a [[Pentecostal]] worship style, and sermons have a strongly conservative, [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] interpretation of [[Bible|Biblical]] teachings. Its membership is drawn mainly from lower socio-economic sections of New Zealand society and is multicultural, although predominantly [[Māori culture|Māori]] and [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]]. Brian Tamaki is himself Māori, and the church has been identified as part of the Māori cultural renaissance of recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Lineham contextualises Destiny Church as a part of a broader cultural phenomenon in "[http://listener.co.nz/default,2554,2548,0.sm Wanna be in my gang?]". ''The Listener''. '''195''' (3357). 11 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Locations===
Destiny Church started off as "Lake City Church", which had a membership of 20 people. Within two years, it had grown to 300 members. Over the years, Destiny Churches were established in the following locations:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.destinychurch.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=178&lt;/ref&gt;

At its peak in 2003, Destiny Church had a network of 19 churches throughout New Zealand, with a total membership in excess of 5,000. By June 2012 it had 11 remaining churches, with fewer than 3000 regular attendees. Churches have closed in Porirua, Wanganui and Dunedin.&lt;ref name=Hurley201206&gt;{{cite news |title=Destiny family firm: for theirs is the kingdom |first=Bevan |last=Hurley |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10810290 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=4 June 2012 |accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 2013, Destiny Church Wanganui was no longer listed on the main church website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Find Your Local Destiny Church|url=https://www.destinychurch.org.nz/locations|publisher=Destiny Church|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, other branches had [[Kaitaia]], [[Opotiki]], [[Taumaranui]], and [[Hawkes Bay]] had either closed down or merged with other church branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Craig|title=Comment: Uncertain Destiny?|url=http://www.gaynz.com/article/print/31/article_1646.php|accessdate=23 April 2018|publisher=GayNZ.com|date=28 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadcasting===
Destiny TV, a [[televangelism|televangelist]] ministry, launched in 2001 and produced 30-minute programmes that ran every weekday morning on New Zealand's national television broadcaster.  The programmes were funded by donations from Destiny Church members.  TVNZ ceased to broadcast the programme in late 2004 just after the formation of the [[Destiny New Zealand]] political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mather|first1=Mike|title=TVNZ pulls plug on Destiny Church programme|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/rotorua-daily-post/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503438&amp;objectid=10917940|accessdate=23 April 2018|publisher=''[[Rotorua Daily Post]]''; ''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=10 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}}, Destiny TV still operates as the video production arm of Destiny Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Destiny TV|url=https://www.destinychurch.org.nz/copy-of-production|publisher=Destiny Church|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weekly Destiny TV programmes are available for streaming on Destiny Church's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch Live|url=https://www.destinychurch.org.nz/watch|publisher=Destiny Church|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
The Destiny Church movement was founded in 1998&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.destinychurch.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=48:our-history&amp;catid=44:aboutus&amp;Itemid=79 Destiny Church: Our History], destinychurch.org.nz, retrieved 31 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; from 20 members of Lake City Church in [[Rotorua]], initially calling itself City Church Auckland. Destiny Church was founded by Brian Tamaki and his wife Hannah Tamaki, who continue to serve as Visionary and Senior Ministers of Destiny Church.&lt;ref name="About Us" /&gt; Destiny Church had a close relationship with [[New Birth Missionary Baptist Church]] in Atlanta, USA, the church of Bishop [[Eddie Long]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.destinychurch.org.nz/our-church-about-us-103/our-church-about-us-103 |title=Our church |year=2010 |publisher=Destiny Church |location=Auckland |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100820141503/http://www.destinychurch.org.nz/our-church-about-us-103/our-church-about-us-103 |archivedate=20 August 2010 |accessdate=4 June 2012 |quote=The church corporate relates closely with New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Atlanta USA, which is the home of Bishop Eddie L. Long, spiritual father to Bishop Tamaki.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography Tamaki described meeting Long, "my spiritual father", in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tamaki link to US sex-case bishop |first=Vaimoana |last=Tapaleao |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10675732 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=24 September 2010 |accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Peter Lineham has compared Destiny Church to the [[Ratana]] movement and linked with historical [[Māori religion|Christianity in Māoridom]].&lt;ref name=lineham_among&gt;Lineham, Peter (5 April 2006). "[http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/about-massey/news/article.cfm?mnarticle=among-the-believers-05-04-2006 Among the believers]". Massey University.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Destiny is in some ways very different from other Pentecostal churches. The latest Destiny stories have focused on its growing links with Ratana, its presence at Waitangi, its Legacy march down Queen Street and the title of bishop which its founder and leader, Brian Tamaki has taken ...&lt;br/&gt;We must recall that it is Māori at heart, although not tribal Māori. It trains people in Kapa haka (and performed them all too vehemently at Waitangi); it captures the hearts of many Māori women, perhaps appealing particularly to detribalised Māori. And it has a political agenda which places treaty issues high on the agenda ...&lt;br/&gt;Let there be no doubt, there are some deep tensions running through New Zealand society, troubles underneath the optimism, and fundamentally they are cultural differences. Culture and religion walk hand in hand. The issues facing us today involve a deep debate over values. We should never be confident that we know which side will win.|Peter Lineham|Among the believers&lt;ref name=lineham_among/&gt;}}

===Enough is Enough rally===
Destiny Church has campaigned for a return to what it considers to be "Christian [[morality|moral]] values" in New Zealand society, particularly for the "sanctity of [[marriage]] between a husband and wife".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In August 2004, Destiny members marched on Parliament under their "Enough is Enough" rally which drew 5000 protesters against [[Civil unions in New Zealand|civil unions]] legislation. The rally attracted considerable criticism. The black T-shirts and track-pants worn by many of the marchers prompted negative comparisons with [[Nazi]] [[Sturmabteilung|storm-troopers]] in the New Zealand media.&lt;ref&gt;"March arouses Nazi fears". ''The Press''. 24 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Black shirts spark anger". ''Dominion Post''. 24 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; When the rally was in progress, Tamaki indicated that he did not want to be a politician, saying, "I have a higher calling than a politician, I am a man of God."&lt;ref name="TVNZ_451171"/&gt;

A second march occurred in Auckland along with the Christian Life Centre and the City Impact Churches on 5 March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Auckland civil union march noisy but peaceful |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10113730 |agency=NZPA |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=5 March 2005 |accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plans for a "Destiny City"===
On 29 October 2008 it was reported that Destiny Church was planning on building a holy city in South Auckland. The report was based on comments made by Brian Tamaki at the church's 10th birthday celebration, and released on DVD, where he talks about a {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} site the church had procured, with a budget of $2.4m. He said the community would have its own maraes and medical facilities and that "every child of every member of this church will never go to a state school again".&lt;ref name="3_News_77688"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/News/NationalNews/Brian-Tamaki-announces-plans-for-standalone-community-in-South-Auckland/tabid/423/articleID/77688/cat/64/Default.aspx |title=Brian Tamaki announces plans for standalone community in South Auckland |date=29 October 2008 |work=[[3 News]] |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church subsequently denied the report, a spokesperson saying they only intended to build a new headquarters and supply "social help" programmes, despite Rotorua's ''Daily Post'' quoting Tamaki as saying Destiny planned to create a "city within a city" in 2006.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10540119"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10540119 |title=Destiny denies Manukau 'kingdom' plan |author=Eriksen, Alanah |date=30 October 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Church's 2012 annual conference in Rotorua, Tamaki presented plans including a library, bookshop, early childhood centre, three schools and a university and encouraged [[tithing]], saying "I don't care what the media say, I don't care what your relatives say, I don't care what the world says, nobody should be not tithing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='City of God' dream becomes Destiny |first=John |last=Weekes |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10810380 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=3 June 2012 |accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Momentum conference and pledge of allegiance===
In October 2009, about 700 male members of the church attended a conference called "MoMENtum" in which Tamaki likened himself to [[King David]].&lt;ref name="Secret-video"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Secret-video-reveals-the-inner-workings-of-Destiny-Church/tabid/817/articleID/127420/cat/221/Default.aspx |title=Destiny Church's inner workings revealed in secret video |date=29 October 2009 |work=[[3 News]] |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendees swore a "covenant oath" of loyalty and obedience to Tamaki and were given a "covenant ring" to wear on their right hands. A document entitled ''Protocols &amp; Requirements Between Spiritual Father &amp; His Spiritual Sons'' contains the oath:
:{{cquote|Above all, we stand here today in the presence of God to enter into this sacred covenant with our man of God, Bishop Brian Tamaki ...
To you Bishop we pledge our allegiance, our faithfulness and loyalty. We pledge to serve the cause that is in your heart and to finish that work. Success to you and success to those who help you – for God is with you.&lt;ref name="Covenant Document"/&gt;}}
The document asserts Tamaki's authority as "Bishop" and "spiritual father" of the church he founded. Another section, "Conduct Towards Bishop", states that "Bishop is the tangible expression of God", instructs the "sons" to follow numerous protocols, to defer to Tamaki with unquestioning loyalty and obedience, to follow his dress code, and to never tolerate criticism.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10605956"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10605956&amp;pnum=0 |title=Tamaki's 700 'sons' swear oath of loyalty |author=George, Garth |date=29 October 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political activities===
Richard Lewis, a member of Destiny Church Auckland, formed the [[Destiny New Zealand]] political party in 2003. The party first ran candidates in [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005]].  Candidates from four different churches joined with candidates who came from Destiny Church.  Despite Tamaki's prediction that the church would rule New Zealand by 2008, the party's 42 candidates gained only 0.6 percent of the vote. This fell well short of the five percent threshold required to enter [[Parliament of New Zealand|Parliament]] without an electorate MP but proved the best performance of any party that failed to enter Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://2005.electionresults.govt.nz/partystatus.html 2005 election results by Party] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429000000/http://2005.electionresults.govt.nz/partystatus.html |date=29 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, [[City Impact Church New Zealand|City Impact Church]] and Destiny Church collaborated in the establishment of the [[The Family Party|"Family Party"]], but the latter won just 0.35% of the party vote in [[New Zealand general election, 2008|New Zealand's 2008 general election]] and  dissolved in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;

Destiny Church recognises Māori as [[tangata whenua]] ("People of the Land"). It also regards itself as an "iwi-[[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]" or a spiritual tribe of God's people set aside as a chosen raise, citing a scriptural premise from 1 Peter 2:9. In 2008, Destiny Church sought to claim [[Urban Māori|urban Māori]] status so that they could serve Māori congregants who were disconnected from their tribes. Māori broadcaster and urban Māori advocate [[Willie Jackson (politician)|Willie Jackson]] supported Destiny's proposal by arguing that Tamaki and Destiny Church had changed the lives of thousands of former Māori criminals, fraudsters, and drug dealers for the better. Destiny's socially conservative position on gay rights and women drew opposition from various sectors including Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]].{{Sfn|Haami|2018|187-188}} 

In October 2008, Destiny Church was awarded Urban Māori Authority status and [[Te Rūnanga a Iwi o Te Oranga Ake]] was incorporated to serve as the church's service provider arm. In 2011, Destiny Church received funding from the [[Ministry of Social Development (New Zealand)|Ministry of Social Development]] for four Community Max programmes to help 79 youths in Auckland, [[Waikato]], and the [[Bay of Plenty]] transition into full-time employment. However, Destiny Church struggled to receive government funding for other projects including a charter school. As a result, the Church has had to fund its own community services programme including the "Man Up" programme to help men become better fathers, husbands, and leaders in their own families and communities.{{Sfn|Haami|2018|188}}

==Controversies==
===Opposition to homosexuality===
Destiny Church and its leader Brian Tamaki have been known for their vocal opposition to homosexuality. On 23 August 2004, Destiny Church organized a large public rally known as the "Enough is Enough" march in Wellington to oppose the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]]'s proposed [[Civil Union Act 2004|Civil Union Act]]. For the march, Destiny Church members wore black shirts emblazoned with the slogan "Enough is Enough." The march generated considerable media and public attention with critics such as Labour MPs [[Georgina Beyer]] and [[David Benson-Pope]] likening the marchers to Nazis.{{sfn|Lineham|2013|p=12-22}}

Bishop Tamaki attracted controversy when he blamed the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake|2010]] and [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]]s on sinful behavior such as murder and homosexuality during a sermon on 16 November 2016. These statements preceded the [[2016 Kaikoura earthquake]] by a few hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Watch: Brian Tamaki tells followers, 'the weight of human sin' caused the Christchurch earthquake - hours before Kaikoura|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/watch-brian-tamaki-tells-followers-weight-human-sin-caused-christchurch-earthquake-hours-before-kaikoura-disaster?auto=5212114211001|accessdate=17 November 2016|publisher=[[1 News]]|date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strongman|first1=Susan|title=Bishop Brian Tamaki blames gays, murderers and sinners for earthquakes|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11749215|accessdate=17 November 2016|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tamaki's remarks were condemned by several leading New Zealand public figures including the [[Mayor of Christchurch]] [[Bob Parker (mayor)|Bob Parker]], [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[John Key]], and the [[Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia|Anglican]] [[bishop]] of [[Dunedin]], [[Kelvin Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir Bob Parker demands 'off beam' Brian Tamaki apologise to Christchurch, Kaikoura for blaming quake on sins|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/sir-bob-parker-demands-off-beam-brian-tamaki-apologise-christchurch-kaikoura-blaming-quake-sins|accessdate=17 November 2016|publisher=1 News|date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strongman|first1=Susan|title=Shock over Destiny leader Brian Tamaki's homophobic remarks|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11749423|accessdate=17 November 2016|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNeilly|first1=Hamish|title=Bishop of Dunedin on Brian Tamaki: 'He's telling porkies'|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/86576726/bishop-of-dunedin-on-brian-tamaki-hes-telling-porkies|accessdate=17 November 2016|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[Auckland]]-based critic Aaron Smithson also organized a [[Change.org]] petition calling for the revocation of Destiny Church's tax-free status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Akoorie|first1=Natalie|title=Petition to stop Destiny Church having tax-free status gaining support|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11749796|accessdate=17 November 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2018, Tamaki tweeted his support for Australian rugby union player [[Israel Folau]]'s comments condemning homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Focus: 'Cry baby gays' - Brian Tamaki tweets his support for Folau|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/national-video/news/video.cfm?c_id=1503075&amp;gal_cid=1503075&amp;gallery_id=191798|accessdate=23 April 2018|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Destiny Church Brian Tamaki says 'cry baby gays' will go to hell|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/04/destiny-church-brian-tamaki-says-cry-baby-gays-will-go-to-hell.html|accessdate=23 April 2018|publisher=[[Newshub]]|date=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and religious views===
On his website "New Zealand: A Nation Under Siege" (bishoptamaki.org.nz) Tamaki declared the government of New Zealand to be "inherently evil",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bishoptamaki.org.nz/FAQ.htm#A_Government_gone_Evil "A Government gone Evil"]. bishoptamaki.org.nz. Retrieved 2005. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230110751/http://www.bishoptamaki.org.nz/FAQ.htm#A_Government_gone_Evil |date=30 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that some members of Parliament chose not to swear on the Bible, and one ([[Ashraf Choudhary]]) swore on the [[Qur'an]], when being sworn into government. In a June 2005 interview, Tamaki said Destiny was ready to wage war on "secular humanism, liberalism, relativism, pluralism", on "a Government gone evil", on the "modern-day witchcraft" of the media, and on the "radical homosexual agenda".&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10331506"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10331506 |title=Bishop fulfils his destiny |author=Crewdson, Patrick |date=19 June 2005 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cult allegations===
Following this pledge, the church was labelled as a [[cult]] by several New Zealand media outlets&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10605962"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10605962 |title=Tamaki's church becoming a cult |author=George, Garth |date=29 October 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ODT_79898"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odt.co.nz/opinion/opinion/79898/not-brian039s-destiny-be-humble-meek |title=Not Brian's destiny to be humble, meek |date=29 October 2009 |work=[[Otago Daily Times]] |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=covenant_slammed&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/destiny-s-controversial-covenant-slammed-3101294 |title=Destiny's controversial covenant slammed |date=29 October 2009 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other observers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cults.co.nz/d.php#destiny NZ Cults &amp; Religious Groups List], Cults.co.nz&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[TVNZ]],&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_3012558"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/3012558/Destinys-Brian-Tamaki-answers-cult-accusations |title=Destiny's Brian Tamaki answers 'cult' accusations |date=29 October 2009 |agency=[[NZPA]] |newspaper=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Vrankovich of Cultwatch criticised the covenant, saying Mr Tamaki was "taking a kingship position", and
:{{cquote|Within this document we see here the very mechanism by which cults go askew, Christians were sick of being identified with Mr Tamaki and the Destiny Church.
I mean here you have a man who thinks he is a biblical character, in this case King David, and he's building himself an army of mighty men who will do want he wants. I have grave concerns for that, grave concerns.}}

In the same interview&lt;ref name=covenant_slammed/&gt; following the reports of October 2009, Mr Tamaki and Richard Lewis defended the pledge on the basis that it was taken willingly, and simply attempted to set standards and codify established practice within the church. Lewis denied the "cult" claims, noting that church services are open to the public. Tamaki denied the existence of a "[[cult of personality]]", saying that he was simply setting a visible example for men to follow; and that the church helps a lot of people from difficult backgrounds.

''[[Campbell Live]]'', a current affairs programme,&lt;ref name="Secret-video"/&gt; made use of a covert camera and an unidentified witness to critique church practices and the Momentum conference. The church later issued a response,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.destinychurch.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=107:response-to-tv3-campbell-live-item&amp;catid=28:media-releases&amp;Itemid=75 Response to TV3 Campbell Live item]". destinychurch.org.nz, retrieved 1 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "a number of comments made by the individual were grossly inaccurate", that the source was not credible, and the report reflected "poor practice".

In a separate report&lt;ref name="TVNZ_3101249"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/destiny-s-controversial-covenant-slammed-3101294/video?vid=3101249 |title=Destiny's controversial covenant slammed |date=29 October 2009 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Lineham, associate professor at Massey University, expressed similar concerns but stopped short of using the word 'cult':
:{{cquote|I don’t feel very comfortable about this word cult, because we use ‘cult’ as a sort of slang word to mean something really over the top. The fact is, there is no precise point at which you move to a total rejection of other connections.}}

Cult allegations resurfaced in 2010, when Cultwatch accused Tamaki of denying the bodily [[resurrection of Jesus]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cultwatch.com/briantamaki.html&lt;/ref&gt; the claims and Tamaki's denial of the cult status generated substantial media coverage.&lt;ref name="nzherald.co.nz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&amp;objectid=10706749 |title=Garth George: Destiny must be treated as a cult |author=George, Garth |date=17 February 2011 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10706840"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10706840 |title=Destiny, cult-watchers in clash over Christ |date=17 February 2011 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tithing===
Media articles using former Destiny Church members as sources have alleged that Tamaki's has an outspoken autocratic style and highlighted the church's frequent appeals for tithe contributions, and its insular culture.&lt;ref name="SST pretty penny"&gt;"[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-12021380.html Making a pretty penny from heaven]". ''Sunday Star Times'', 20 June 2004. (Link is to Highbeam Research; the first few sentences are provided free, but payment is required for the rest.)&lt;/ref&gt; The Sunday Star Times highlighted Tamaki's visible wealth and personal luxury, questioning its consistency with the church's tithing system.&lt;ref name="SST pretty penny"/&gt; Church pastors agree to a [[restraint of trade]] that applies in the event that they withdraw as pastors.&lt;ref name="NZH walkout"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10629377 |title=Destiny split triggers exodus |last1=Tapaleao |first1=Vaimoana |date=2 March 2010 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church's Brisbane pastor resigned in March 2010 over a difference in doctrine.&lt;ref name="NZH walkout"/&gt; 25 members of the congregation followed him out of the church, some expressed their support for him to the media, saying that the church was a money-making cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10629591&amp;pnum=0 |title=It's a cash cult, say Destiny's walk-outs |last1=Tapaleao |first1=Vaimoana |date=3 March 2010 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 29 August 2017, Destiny Church co-founder and senior pastor Hannah Tamaki attracted media attention for purchasing a new [[Mercedes-Benz]] AMG GLE63 S SUV worth NZ$207,900. This coincided with reports that the Charities Services was considering stripping three of Destiny Church's charities of their charitable status for failing to file returns. Some critics have regarded these expenses as extravagant luxuries that come at the expense of church members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Appleby|first1=Luke|title=Destiny Church's Hannah Tamaki again splashes out on flash Mercedes - and this one's a 577hp beast|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/destiny-churchs-hannah-tamaki-again-splashes-flash-mercedes-and-ones-577hp-beast|accessdate=23 April 2018|publisher=[[1 News]]|date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Destiny Church leader spends large on new car|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11913122|accessdate=23 April 2018|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged sexual assault===
In late March 2010, controversy arose over allegations against two adult children of Destiny Church Taranaki Pastors Robyn and Lee Edmonds, it was alleged that their son had indecently assaulted a thirteen-year-old girl and their daughter had been involved with a sixteen-year-old boy in foster care. Charges were withdrawn by Police with their son as there was no evidence. The Edmonds resigned from Destiny Church Taranaki leadership.&lt;ref name="3_News_148676"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Destiny-Church-abuse-allegations/tabid/817/articleID/148676/Default.aspx |title=Destiny Church abuse allegations |date=29 March 2010 |work=[[3 News]] |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10649992"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10649992 |title=Destiny Church members resign after official inquiry |author=Fisher, David |date=6 June 2010 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revocation of tax-exempt status===
In early October 2017, the [[Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)|Department of Internal Affairs]] issued notice to strip two of Destiny Church's biggest charities, Destiny International Trust and Te Hahi o Nga Matamua Holdings, of their charitable status for failing to file the required annual returns. 15 Destiny-associated charities had repeatedly failed to file their returns in accordance with the Charities Act 2005 for the past two years. This news accompanied reports that more than 100,000 people had signed a petition calling for the New Zealand Government to revoke Destiny Church's tax-free status in response to Tamaki's remarks blaming gays for the [[2010 Christchurch earthquake|2010]] and [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]]s, and church co-founder Hannah Tamaki's extravagant purchase of a brand new Mercedes-Benz in mid-August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plumb|first1=Simon|title=Government moves to strip Destiny Church charities of their tax-exempt status|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/government-moves-strip-destiny-church-charities-their-tax-exempt-status|accessdate=23 April 2018|publisher=[[1 News]]|date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Destiny Church failed to respond to the Department's requests, the Charities Registration Board stripped Destiny International Trust and Te Hari O Nga Matamua Holdings of their charitable status, effective 20 December.

{{History of Ukraine}}

'''The Directorate''', or '''Directory''' ({{Lang-uk|Директорія}}, ''Dyrektoriya'') was a provisional collegiate revolutionary state committee of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], initially formed on November 13–14, 1918 during a session of the [[Ukrainian National Union]] in rebellion against [[Ukrainian State|Skoropadsky's regime]].&lt;ref group="a"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/picturedisplay.asp?linkpath=pic\U\K\Ukrainian_National_Republic_Map.jpg Map]&lt;/ref&gt; During the overthrow of Pavlo Skoropadsky it was named as the ''Executive Council of the State Affairs'' ({{Lang-uk|Рада Завідуючих Державними Справами}}). Its authority was extended by the [[Labor Congress of Ukraine]] on January 23–28, 1919.

After unsuccessful attempts to gather members of the committee, it dissolved on November 10, 1920. On November 12, 1920 by the 'Law on the Temporary Supreme Authority and the Legislative System of the UNR' the executive council was reformed into a single person government position.

==Overview==
The Directory was formed until a new council was to be elected to form the professional government. It was decided not to restore functioning of the [[Central Rada]] which was favored by the [[Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party|SR-centrists]] [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]] and [[Vsevolod Holubovych]]. The new council, the [[Labor Congress]], appointed the Directory as the Extraordinary Government Body in the protection of the republic. It was charged to [[enactment of a bill|enact]] laws in the absence of the [[Labor Congress]] due to the political situation in the country, while the Council of the People's Ministers was invested with the executive powers. The Directory consisted of five delegates from various parties and representation groups.

==Members==
Vynnychenko left the government (10 February 1919) in the hope that the Directory would establish friendly talks with representatives of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]]&lt;ref group="a"&gt;Others speculate that Vynnychenko left because of  political disagreements with Petliura over state affairs .&lt;/ref&gt; while Petliura left the [[Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party|SDPists]], thus demonstrating that the Ukrainian government had changed its political agenda and was not the same one that had signed [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine–Central Powers)|the treaty]] in [[Brest, Belarus|Brest-Litovsk]] on 9 February 1918.  In light of that a new Prime Minister was appointed as well, [[Serhiy Ostapenko]], who headed his non-socialist government from February 11, 1919. When talks failed Ostapenko was replaced by [[Borys Martos]] on April 9, 1919.

# [[Volodymyr Vynnychenko]] ([[Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party|Esdek]], Chairman; November 14, 1918 - February 11, 1919)
# [[Symon Petliura]] ([[Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party|Esdek]], delegate of the [[Sich Riflemen]]. Chairman, February 11, 1919 - November 10, 1920)
# [[Fedir Shvets]] (Non-partisan member, delegate of the Peasant Associations).&lt;ref group="a"&gt;The Peasant Association had close ties with the [[Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party|UPSR]].&lt;/ref&gt; Directorate member, 13 November 1918 to 25 May 1920.
# {{Interlanguage link multi| Andryi Havrylovych Makarenko | uk |3= Макаренко Андрій Гаврилович}} (Non-partisan member, delegate of the railway workers)
# {{Interlanguage link multi| Opanas Mykhailovych Andrievsky | uk |3= Андрієвський Опанас Михайлович}} ([[Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Independists|UPSI]])

* Shvets and Makarenko left the country on state matters on November 15, 1919. When Petliura asked them (21 May 1920) to return they never responded and were excluded from their duties and obligations.
* Andrievsky quit the Directory because of the Otaman [[Volodymyr Oskilko]] Affair (April 29, 1919).
* [[Yevhen Petrushevych]], the dictator of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]], joined the Directory in accordance with a resolution of the [[Labor Congress]] following the unification of the two Ukrainian states (22 January 1919), but he did not actually participate in the Directory's work and eventually resigned{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} from it.

===List of governments===
Over two years (December 1918 to November 1920) there were five governments before the Directorate went into official exile at the end of 1920. Between 15 December and 25 December 1918 a stand-off took place between the Revolutionary Committee in Kiev and the provisional Executive Council of State Affairs (TRZDS) in Vinnytsia. It took couple of weeks before the new government was formed on December 26 headed by [[Volodymyr Chekhivsky]] as President of the [[Council of People's Ministers]] (Prime Minister).

In December 1918 [[Hetman of Ukraine|Hetman]] of the [[Ukrainian State]] [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]] was deposed and the Directorate was established.&lt;ref name=endSkoro&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qmN95fFocsMC&amp;pg=PA849&amp;dq=Ukrainian+State+Hetman+Pavlo&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=b5iaUbfCBefA0QWUloGYDQ&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ukrainian%20State%20Hetman%20Pavlo&amp;f=false Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States: 1999], [[Routledge]], 1999, {{ISBN|1857430581}} (page 849)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Orest&gt;[[Orest Subtelny]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=l5uiWHgRphQC&amp;pg=PA356&amp;dq=Ukrainian+State+Hetman+Pavlo&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=b5iaUbfCBefA0QWUloGYDQ&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ukrainian%20State%20Hetman%20Pavlo&amp;f=false ''Ukraine: A History''], [[Toronto]]: [[University of Toronto Press]], 1988, {{ISBN|0-8020-5808-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Hetmanate recovery===
With the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in World War I, Skoropadsky could no longer rely on Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]]'s support. On November 13, 1918 Skoropadky's opponents set up a rival body known as the Directory, whose forces were headed by the newly reformed [[Sich Rifles]]. Most of Skoropadsky's troops joined with the Directory during a month long the Ukrainian Civil War. Skoropadsky then turned to some of the Russian officers who were fighting alongside [[Denikin]], forming them into a Special Corps, but these troops were not able to face the Directory troops.  On December 19, 1918, the Directory troops took [[Kiev]] and overthrew Skoropadsky's regime.

The Directory re-established the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR).  The new regime was torn between the pro-nationalistic, including the party of peasant-democrats, and the factions for the federal union with Russia. At the end the idea to reestablish the [[Central Rada]] was set aside as well as to recover all its legal acts yet the most important one were preserved. On December 26, 1918 the Directory released its declaration to eliminate the Hetman regime.

By the end of 1918 the Directory began to be dominated by the Ukrainian military leader, [[Symon Petliura]].

Faced by many enemies on all sides the UNR's army was organised to face each threat. To the North-east were the [[Bolsheviks]], to the south-east were the [[White movement|Russian Whites]], to the south-west [[Romania]]ns who had claims on territory in [[Bucovina]] and [[Halychyna]], and the French intervention force took [[Odessa]] in December 1918 to fill the power vacuum left by the withdrawing Austrians and Germans. Coming quickly to some understanding with the French and the Romanians, the UNR's army was able to employ more men on other fronts.

===Change of powers 1919-1920===
{{see also|Ukrainian–Soviet War}}
With major fighting breaking out in January 1919, the Ukrainians were pushed back and Kiev fell in February 1919. The government moved to [[Vinnytsia]] on February 5, 1919. A political trick took place that the Directory tried to play with [[Volodymyr Vynnychenko]] resignation to demonstrate a change of powers in the Ukrainian government and maybe attain a possible acceptance with the Entente. [[Symon Petliura]] has left the party and replaced the Vynnychenko's position who was too well known. Petliura has assumed the position of the Directory's chairman on February 11, 1919, a week after the government moved to [[Podolie|Podillia]]. The talks, alias, were proved to be without results. By May 1919, the Directory's armies had been squeezed into a narrow strip of land around [[Brody]]. Soviets then negotiated with the [[Poles]], who were attacking the Ukrainians from behind, with this ceasefire, the Ukrainians were able to counter-attack and re-take [[Podilia]] and established a new capital in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]]. In June, the UNR's forces were joined by the [[Western Ukrainian Republic]]'s forces, who had been pushed out of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] by the Poles.  During that time (May 1919), General [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and his white army launched an offensive against the Reds, during the summer and autumn of that year. The ''White Guards'' forces pushed the Reds out of the Central and Eastern Ukraine, thus, given the Directory another chance to reclaim [[Kiev]]. But the constant ''Red Guards'' counter-attacks and a deadly typhus epidemic caused the Petliura forces to be pushed out of Ukraine completely into the well established territory of Poland. A political crisis took place inside the Directory members of which were heavily interfered in the affairs of the Council of People's Ministers. Because of that Shvets and Makarenko were sent on the state matters abroad. Later in May 1920 on the request of Petliura to return they did not reply and were dismissed.

In 1920, the Polish Army reorganized with the help from the two new Ukrainian divisions to prepare an offensive against the Denikin's forces. A [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|UNR-Polish Treaty]] in April 1920 provided for combined operations between the two armies under overall Polish command while recognizing the Polish sovereignty over the territory of the former [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] with the border passing along the [[Zbruch river]]. In the [[Polish-Soviet War in 1920|Soviet-Polish war of 1920]], the Poles and Ukrainians advanced side by side, and the UNR was set up again when they re-took Kiev. But less than a month later the Soviet's summer counter-offensive left the Poles and Ukrainians retreating, an armistice was signed in late 1920. With this great disappointment, the UNR forces launched an attack on their own against the Reds from Polish territory, however that was quickly beaten. They were forced back into Galicia. In 1920 Poland concluded a border dispute by the [[Treaty of Riga]] with the Soviet Union, thus, canceling the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)]]. The Treaty of Riga divided [[Western Ukraine]] among Poland, [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]] and gave the [[Soviet Union]] control over the rest of (current) Ukraine (which became the [[Ukrainian SSR]]).&lt;ref name=endSkoro/&gt;

==Normative Acts==
At the first stage the Directory recovered all of the rights of peasants and workers that were established by the laws passed by the [[Central Rada]].

''Until the complete solution of the Land Reform, the Directory of the Ukrainian People's Republic declares that all small peasant's holdings and all worker's holdings to be left for use of their previous owners, while the rest of lands to be transferred to the peasant with little or no land holdings with the priorities to those joined the Republican forces against the struggle with the former [[Pavlo Skoropadsky|Hetman]]. The Supreme subordination over the land carries the Directory of the Ukrainian People's Republic. This statement concerns also the monastery, church, and government land holdings. For introduction of the Reform there was organized the [[People's Land Committee]]...''

The Directory canceled all the codes of the former Hetmanate government concerning workers policies. The eight-hour working day was reestablished as well as the practice of cooperative agreements, the rights on coalition and activist strikes, and various other normative acts.

{{Party politics}}
A '''dominant-party system''', or '''one-party dominant system''', is a system where there is "a category of parties/political organisations that have successively won election victories and whose future defeat cannot be envisaged or is unlikely for the foreseeable future."&lt;ref name=Suttner&gt;Suttner, R. (2006), "Party dominance 'theory': Of what value?", ''Politikon'' 33 (3), pp. 277-297&lt;/ref&gt; Many are ''[[de facto]]'' [[one-party state|one-party systems]], and often devolve into ''[[de jure]]'' [[one-party state|one-party systems]]. Usually, the dominant party consistently holds [[majority government]], without the need for [[Coalitions of parties|coalitions]].

Examples commonly cited include: [[United Russia]] (CP) in [[Russia]], the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) in [[Turkey]], [[Serbian Progressive Party]] (SNS) in [[Serbia]], [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] (DPS) in [[Montenegro]], the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) in [[Singapore]], the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in [[South Africa]], the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] in [[Japan]], [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]] in [[Bangladesh]], [[MPLA]] in [[Angola]] and the [[ZANU-PF]] in [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name=Suttner/&gt;

==Historical overview==
Opponents of the "dominant party" system or theory argue that it views the meaning of [[democracy]] as given, and that it assumes that only a particular conception of [[representative democracy]] (in which different parties alternate frequently in power) is valid.&lt;ref name=Suttner/&gt; One author argues that "the dominant party 'system' is deeply flawed as a mode of analysis and lacks explanatory capacity. But it is also a very conservative approach to politics. Its fundamental political assumptions are restricted to one form of democracy, electoral politics and hostile to popular politics. This is manifest in the obsession with the quality of electoral opposition and its sidelining or ignoring of popular political activity organised in other ways. The assumption in this approach is that other forms of organisation and opposition are of limited importance or a separate matter from the consolidation of their version of democracy."&lt;ref name=Suttner/&gt;

One of the dangers of dominant parties is "the tendency of dominant parties to conflate party and state and to appoint party officials to senior positions irrespective of their having the required qualities."&lt;ref name=Suttner/&gt; However, in some countries this is common practice even when there is no dominant party.&lt;ref name=Suttner/&gt; In contrast to [[One-party state|one-party system]]s, dominant-party systems can occur within a context of a democratic system. In a one-party system other parties are banned, but in dominant-party systems other political parties are tolerated, and (in democratic dominant-party systems) operate without overt legal impediment, but do not have a realistic chance of winning; the dominant party genuinely wins the votes of the vast majority of voters every time (or, in authoritarian systems, claims to). Under authoritarian dominant-party systems, which may be referred to as "[[electoralism]]" or "soft authoritarianism", [[Parliamentary Opposition|opposition]] parties are legally allowed to operate, but are too weak or ineffective to seriously challenge power, perhaps through various forms of [[Political corruption|corruption]], constitutional quirks that intentionally undermine the ability for an effective opposition to thrive, institutional and/or organizational conventions that support the status quo, occasional but not omnipresent [[political repression]], or inherent cultural values averse to change.

In some states opposition parties are subject to varying degrees of official harassment and most often deal with restrictions on free speech (such as press club), lawsuits against the opposition, and rules or electoral systems (such as [[gerrymandering]] of electoral districts) designed to put them at a disadvantage. In some cases outright [[electoral fraud]] keeps the opposition from power. On the other hand, some dominant-party systems occur, at least temporarily, in countries that are widely seen, both by their citizens and outside observers, to be textbook examples of democracy. The reasons why a dominant-party system may form in such a country are often debated: Supporters of the dominant party tend to argue that their party is simply doing a good job in government and the opposition continuously proposes unrealistic or unpopular changes, while supporters of the opposition tend to argue that the electoral system disfavors them (for example because it is based on the principle of [[first past the post]]), or that the dominant party receives a disproportionate amount of funding from various sources and is therefore able to mount more persuasive campaigns. In states with ethnic issues, one party may be seen as being the party for an ethnicity or race with the party for the majority ethnic, racial or religious group dominating, e.g., the [[African National Congress]] in [[South Africa]] (governing since 1994) has strong support amongst Black South Africans, the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] governed [[Northern Ireland]] from its creation in 1921 until 1972 with the support of the [[Protestant]] majority.

Sub-national entities are often dominated by one party due the area's demographic being on one end of the spectrum. For example, the current elected government of the [[District of Columbia]] has been governed by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] since its creation in the 1970s, [[Bavaria]] by the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] since 1957, [[Madeira Islands|Madeira]] by the [[Partido Social Democrata (Portugal)|Social Democrats]] since 1976, and [[Alberta]] by [[Alberta Progressive Conservative Party|Progressive Conservatives]] 1971&amp;ndash;2015. On the other hand, where the dominant party rules nationally on a genuinely democratic basis, the opposition may be strong in one or more subnational areas, possibly even constituting a dominant party locally; an example is South Africa, where although the [[African National Congress]] is dominant at the national level, the opposition [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] is strong to dominant in the Province of [[Western Cape]].

{{flag|Canada}} 

Federally, a [[multi-party system]] exists, although only two federal parties have ever held power, the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] and the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]]. However, in some provinces, a party holds hegemonic status over all other parties.

* {{flag|Alberta}} has voted for the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] or one of its institutional predecessors (the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]], the [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]], or the [[Canadian Alliance]]) in every single federal election since 1957. The [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta]] also won every single provincial election from 1971 through 2015. But in surveys now leads the [[United Conservative Party]] (UCP) again. The 2015 provincial election saw a surprise win by the New Democratic Party, in part due to the [[Wildrose Party]] splitting the conservative vote.
** [[Alberta Senate nominee election, 2012|Senate nominee election, 2012]]: 40.47% and won 3 of 3 seats

===== United States =====
{{flag|United States}}  

As a whole, the nation has a [[two-party system]], with the main parties since the mid-19th century being [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. However, some states and cities have been dominated by one of these parties for up to several decades. Generally, the Democratic Party dominate in the urban metropolitan areas, while the Republican Party dominate in the rural areas. Since 2010, majority of the states are dominated by the Republican Party. With control in both the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and [[Donald Trump]]'s victory in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 elections]], the Republican Party dominate in both federal and state levels. 

Dominated by the Democratic Party:
* {{flag|California}} had [[Arnold Schwarzenegger|a Republican governor]] as late as 2011 but has voted for Democrats in national races and has a legislature dominated by the Democrats since the 1990s.

The republic's constitution added no such proviso, and the Portuguese Republican Party was able to keep the other minor republican parties (monarchic parties had been declared illegal) from winning elections. On the rare occasions when it was ousted from power, it was overthrown by force and was again by the means of a counter-coup that it returned to power, until its final fall, with the republic itself, in 1926.
*'''{{flag|Sweden}}''': The [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] in [[Sweden]] from 1932 to 2006 except only for some months in 1936 (1936–1939 and 1951–1957 in coalition with the [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Farmers' League]], 1939–1945 at the head of a government of national unity), 1976-1982 and 1991-1994. The party is still the largest party in Sweden and has been so in every general election since 1917 (hence the largest party even before the universal suffrage was introduces in 1921). The former Prime minister and party leader [[Tage Erlander]] led the Swedish government for an uninterrupted tenure of 23 years (1946–1969), the longest in any democracy so far. Since 2006 the party support has declined.
*'''{{flag|Turkey}}''': In [[Turkey]]'s single-party period, the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] became the major political organisation of a single-party state.

In the state of [[Florida]], persons convicted of a felony are stripped of their voting rights in addition to other sentencing. This restriction lasts for life, and the right can only be restored through special permissions from both the governor and the state clemency board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?submenu=3#A1S01.|title=Statutes &amp; Constitution : Constitution : Online Sunshine |website=www.leg.state.fl.us|access-date=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is known as [[felony disenfranchisement]], a common punishment across the United States, being law in 48 states (not practiced in Vermont and Maine)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/felony-disenfranchisement-laws-in-the-united-states/|title=Felony Disenfranchisement Laws in The United States|website=The Sentencing Project|language=en-US|access-date=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, Florida is one of only twelve states that bans convicted felons from voting post-sentence and one of only four that maintains that ban for life. 

A referendum held on November 6, 2018, to restore the voting rights of Florida's nonviolent felons passed by nearly 65%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://floridaelectionwatch.gov/Amendments|title=Amendments|website=floridaelectionwatch.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative will go into effect January.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Laws_governing_the_initiative_process_in_Florida|title=Laws governing the initiative process in Florida - Ballotpedia|work=Ballotpedia|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those convicted of murder or sexual abuse, however, remain disenfranchised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/florida-felon-voting-rights.html|title=1.4 Million Floridians With Felonies Win Long-Denied Right to Vote|last=|first=|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Felony disenfranchisement in Florida began with the 1838 ratification of the state constitution. Article VI Section 13 of the original state constitution states, “laws shall be made by the General Assembly, to exclude from office, and from suffrage, those who shall have been or may thereafter be convicted of bribery, perjury, forgery, or other high crime, or misdemeanor.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fall.fsulawrc.com/crc/conhist/1838con.html|title=Florida Constitution of 1838|website=fall.fsulawrc.com|access-date=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law took effect in 1845 when Florida became a [[U.S. state]] and remained largely intact despite notable wording changes in 1868 and 1968 until 2007.

During the 1868 state constitutional convention, Florida largely overhauled its constitution: A small expansion of the felon voting section was changed to say, “nor shall any person convicted of felony be qualified to vote at any election unless restored to civil rights… the Legislature shall have power and shall enact the necessary laws to exclude from every office of honor, power, trust, or profit, civil or military, within the State, and from the right of suffrage, all persons convicted of bribery, perjury, larceny, or of infamous crime.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fall.fsulawrc.com/crc/conhist/1868con.html|title=Florida Constitution of 1868|website=fall.fsulawrc.com|access-date=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although minor, this rewrite marks the first instance of the word “felony” in official documents to describe actions that warrant exclusion from voting rights.

There were no reform efforts of note nor any changes to the felon voting section of the constitution until 1968, where the section was simplified to include only felonies as reasons to ban criminals from voting; bribery, perjury, larceny, and infamous crimes were struck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fall.fsulawrc.com/crc/conhist/1968con.html|title=Florida Constitution of 1968|website=fall.fsulawrc.com|access-date=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the law would stand until 2007.

In 1974, the [[Florida Legislature]] passed a bill that would allow felons to regain the right to vote upon the conclusion of their sentences. However, the [[Supreme Court of Florida]] ruled that the bill was unconstitutional because it bypassed the governor’s [[Pardon|clemency power]]. Though, many spoke out throughout the rest of the 20th century, this remained the only real attempt at reform until the 21st century.

On September 22, 2000, the [[Brennan Center for Justice]] represented eight ex-felons that filed a civil complaint against the state of Florida claiming its implementation of felony disenfranchisement violated the federal [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] as well as the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]], [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]], [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]], and [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth]] amendments of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution.]] The case, ''Johnson v. Bush'', lasted the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] ruled in 2005 that the law would stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/voting-rights-restoration-efforts-florida|title=Voting Rights Restoration Efforts in Florida {{!}} Brennan Center for Justice|website=www.brennancenter.org|language=en|access-date=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 2007, Governor [[Charlie Crist]] was able to pass legislation that allowed ex-felons to regain the right to vote if approved by the Parole Commission. Crist intended this reform to include automatic reinstatement for all ex-felons that were not convicted of murder or violent sex crimes; however, other public officials at the time felt the reform was too lenient on criminals. This reform ultimately allowed over 150,000 ex-felons to regain the right to vote but was reversed in March 2011 under Governor [[Rick Scott]]. Scott also added the additional barrier of a five-year waiting period between the end of a sentence and application for voting reinstatement. This current iteration of the law has remained unchanged through today.

On February 1, 2018, federal judge Mark Walker ruled that Florida’s process of choosing which ex-felons should have their voting rights restored was unconstitutional. Walker argued that Florida’s system for re-enfranchisement is too broad for interpretation. As such, Walker claimed the decision to reinstate voting rights falls within the personal discretion of the governor and the clemency board, potentially allowing for personal bias to influence decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/02/01/federal-judge-strikes-down-floridas-system-for-restoring-felon-voting-rights/.|title=Judge strikes down Florida’s system for restoring felons’ voting rights|last=Bousquet|first=Steve|work=Tampa Bay Times|access-date=April 29, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
According to [[ProCon.org]]:

*10.43% of the Florida population is disenfranchised&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://felonvoting.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000287|title=Number of People by State Who Cannot Vote Due to a Felony Conviction - Felon Voting - ProCon.org|website=felonvoting.procon.org|access-date=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1,686,318 total Floridians are disenfranchised.
* Florida has the most disenfranchised citizens in the United States.
* Florida has the highest disenfranchisement rate in the United States.
* 23.3% of black voters in Florida can’t vote because of felony disenfranchisement.

==Felony classifications==
A [[felony]] is “a crime, typically one involving violence, regarded as more serious than a misdemeanor, and usually punishable by imprisonment for more than one year or by death.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/felony|title=Definition of FELONY|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Florida, there are four categories of felonies: third-degree, second-degree, first-degree, and capital or life felonies. While the severity of sentencing depends on the category the act falls in, all felons are automatically disenfranchised.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/state-felony-laws/florida-felony-class.htm|title=Florida Felony Crimes by Class and Sentences|work=www.criminaldefenselawyer.com|access-date=April 29, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''First Baptist Church of Jacksonville''' is a large [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] church in [[Downtown Jacksonville|Downtown]] [[Jacksonville, Florida]], U.S. As of 2011, First Baptist Church has 28,000 members and an average attendance of around 7,500 for Sunday services, making it the third largest church in the Southern Baptist Convention.&lt;ref name=attendance/&gt;&lt;ref name=churchsize&gt;{{cite news |title= Church size: It's all in the numbers |author= Jeff Brumley|url= http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/063008/lif_296770295.shtml |newspaper= [[The Florida Times-Union]]|date= June 30, 2008 |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main Downtown Campus comprises nine square blocks of property connected by above-ground crosswalks. The campus includes several auditoriums for services, a Sunday school building, and facilities for First Baptist Academy, a private [[K-10 school]]. 

First Baptist Church has its origins in the oldest [[Baptists|Baptist]] congregation in Jacksonville, [[Bethel Baptist Institutional Church|Bethel Baptist Church]], established in 1838. The church experienced a period of considerable growth in the mid-20th century, and now encompasses eleven square blocks of downtown Jacksonville. Several former pastors, including [[Homer G. Lindsay, Jr.]] and [[Jerry Vines]], were widely influential in the Southern Baptist Convention, leading it in both growth and a shift towards [[conservatism]].

==History==
===Early years===
First Baptist Church traces its origins to [[Bethel Baptist Institutional Church|Bethel Baptist Church]] (now Bethel Baptist Institutional Church), the earliest Baptist church to be founded in Jacksonville. Bethel Baptist was established under co-pastors James McDonald and Ryan Frier in July 1838 with only six charter members, four whites and two blacks, the latter of whom were slaves of white members..&lt;ref name=Bartley&gt;Bartley, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosser&gt;Rosser, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership quickly grew, with most early congregants being black slaves who received day passes from their masters to attend.&lt;ref name=Bartley/&gt; The first meetings were held at "Mother Sam's", a local plantation, and in 1861 a permanent meeting hall was erected in [[Downtown Jacksonville]] at Church and Julia Streets.&lt;ref name=Bartley/&gt; The Bethel Baptist Church remained interracial until after the [[American Civil War]], at which point the decision was made to [[racial segregation in the United States|segregate]] the congregation by race. White members attempted to force out the blacks, and took their case to court. However, the court found in favor of the blacks, who were in the majority, determining that they were the rightful owners of the Bethel Baptist name and property.&lt;ref name=Bartley/&gt; As a result the whites left the congregation, forming Tabernacle Baptist Church, which was eventually renamed First Baptist Church.&lt;ref name=Rosser/&gt; Bethel Baptist Institutional Church now numbers its congregation at approximately 10,000 members.

In 1866 Tabernacle Baptist Church purchased the Church Street property from Bethel Baptist Church, as was required by the court.&lt;ref name=Bartley/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosser/&gt; The church went through a number of changes over the next years, and in 1892 it moved to its current location between Church and Hogan Streets, adopting the name First Baptist Church.&lt;ref name=Rosser/&gt; The building was entirely destroyed in the [[Great Fire of 1901]], which ravaged downtown Jacksonville. In 1903 the foundation was laid for a new building, which was completed within a year. This building, now known as Hobson Auditorium, still serves as part of the larger First Baptist complex.&lt;ref name=ourhistory&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fbcjax.com/downtown/about-us/our-history |title= First Baptist Church: Our History|author= |date= 2013 |work= fbcjax.com|publisher= First Baptist Church Jacksonville |accessdate=January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
The church did not fare well in the early 20th century. By 1940, First Baptist had accumulated a debt of $125,000 and saw its educational building repossessed by its creditors. That year, the church hired Homer Lindsay, Sr. as their senior pastor. Under his leadership the church reversed its fortunes, and within a few years it paid off its debt, acquired a new education building, and grew its congregation. In 1969 First Baptist hired Lindsay's son, [[Homer Lindsay, Jr.]], as co-pastor; he took over sole pastoral duties upon his father's retirement in 1975. Under Lindsay, Jr. the church experienced even faster growth, emerging as a [[megachurch]] with thousands of members and many new buildings, including a new 3,500-seat auditorium.&lt;ref name=ourhistory/&gt;

[[Jerry Vines]] joined Lindsay as co-pastor in 1982. First Baptist grew even further, becoming a major power in the Southern Baptist Convention and adding a 10,000-seat auditorium in 1993. Vines became a key leader in the growing Convention and was a major figure in its shift toward strict [[conservatism]].&lt;ref name=Era&gt;{{cite news |title=First Baptist in sunset of an era |author= Jeff Brumley |url= http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/050805/met_18683595.shtml |newspaper= [[The Florida Times-Union]]|date= May 8, 2005 |accessdate=January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vines and First Baptist Church received national attention in June 2002 for Vines' controversial statements regarding [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalrecorder.org/content/news/2002/6_14_2002/ne140602vines.shtml Vines calls founder of Islam a 'demon-possessed pedophile' | Friday, June 14, 2002&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029030348/http://www.biblicalrecorder.org/content/news/2002/6_14_2002/ne140602vines.shtml |date=October 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsay died in 2000 and Vines retired in 2006; [[Mac Brunson]] was hired as senior pastor that year. Recent developments include the establishment of First Baptist Academy and of a satellite campus of the church in neighboring [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. Johns County]].&lt;ref name=ourhistory/&gt; Heath Lambert is the current senior pastor.&lt;ref&gt;"Heath Lambert, Senior Pastor," ''FBC JAX,'' 2018. Retrieved 3 Nov. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satellite Campuses==
First Baptist Church of Jacksonville has two satellite campuses. Their South Campus meets in the [[Ponte Vedra High School]] auditorium in St. Johns County. They recently purchased land in the [[Nocatee, St. Johns County, Florida|Nocatee]] community and will build a full campus on the land. In 2013, the Ortega Campus was opened after FBC JAX acquired Ortega Baptist Church.

The '''Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations''' ('''FAO'''; {{lang-fr|Organisation des Nations unies pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture}}, {{lang-it|Organizzazione delle Nazioni Unite per l'Alimentazione e l'Agricoltura}}) is a [[specialized agency]] of the [[United Nations]] that leads international efforts to defeat hunger. Serving both [[developed country|developed]] and [[developing country|developing countries]], FAO acts as a neutral forum where all nations meet as equals to negotiate arguments and debate policy.

FAO is also a source of knowledge and information, and helps developing countries in transition modernize and improve [[agriculture]], [[forestry]] and [[fishery|fisheries]] practices, ensuring good [[nutrition]] and [[food security]] for all. Its [[Latin]] motto, ''{{lang|la|fiat panis}}'', translates as "let there be bread". {{As of|2018|alt=As of August 2018}}, The FAO has 197 member states, including the [[European Union]] (a "member organization"), [[Niue]] and [[Cook Islands|The Cook Islands]] (States in [[Associated state|free-association]] with [[New Zealand]]), and the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Tokelau]], which are associate members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/legal/home/fao-members/en/ |title=List of FAO members |website=fao.org |date= |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The idea of an [[international]] organization for food and agriculture emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century advanced primarily by the US agriculturalist and activist [[David Lubin]]. In May–June 1905, an international conference was held in [[Rome]], Italy, which led to the creation of the [[International Institute of Agriculture]] by the [[King of Italy]] [[Victor Emmanuel III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1910/17 |title=Text of the 1905 convention, from the website of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office |website=fco.gov.uk |access-date=19 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419013432/http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1910/17 |archive-date=19 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1943, the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt called a United Nations Conference on Food and Agriculture. Representatives from forty-four governments gathered at [[The Homestead (Hot Springs, Virginia)|The Homestead Resort in Hot Springs, Virginia]], US, from 18 May to 3 June. They committed themselves to founding a permanent organization for food and agriculture, which happened in [[Quebec City]], Canada, on 16 October 1945 with the conclusion of the '''Constitution of the Food and Agriculture Organization'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/p4228e/P4228E04.htm |title=its origins, formation and evolution 1945-1981 |publisher=FAO |accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The First Session of the FAO Conference was held in the [[Château Frontenac]] in Quebec City from 16 October to 1 November 1945.

[[World War II]] effectively ended the International Agricultural Institute, though it was only officially dissolved by resolution of its Permanent Committee on 27 February 1948. Its functions were then transferred to the recently established FAO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1948/29 |title=Text of the 1946 convention for the dissolution of the International Agricultural Institute |date= |accessdate=15 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418195812/http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1948/29 |archivedate=18 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1940s on, FAO attempted to make its mark within the emerging UN system, focusing mostly on supporting agricultural and nutrition research and providing technical assistance to member countries to boost production in agriculture, fishery, and forestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corinne A. Pernet and Amalia Ribi Forclaz|first=|date=2018|title=Revisiting the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO): International Histories of Agriculture, Nutrition,and Development|url=|journal=International History Review|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s and 1960s, FAO partnered with many different international organizations in development projects.

October 1945]]

In 1951, FAO's headquarters were moved from [[Washington, DC]], United States, to [[Rome]], Italy. The agency is directed by the Conference of Member Nations, which meets every two years to review the work carried out by the organization and to Work and Budget for the next two-year period. The Conference elects a council of 49 member states (serve three-year rotating terms) that acts as an interim governing body, and the Director-General, that heads the agency.

FAO is composed of eight departments: Agriculture and Consumer Protection, Climate, Biodiversity, Land and Water Department, Economic and Social Development, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Forestry, Corporate Services and Technical Cooperation and Programme Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/about/who-we-are/departments/en/ |title=Home &gt; About FAO &gt; Who we are |date=2016 |website=fao.org |accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1994, FAO underwent the most significant restructuring since its founding, to decentralize operations, streamline procedures and reduce costs. As a result, savings of about US$50 million, €35 million a year were realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Managing FAO in Turbulent Times|last=|first=|publisher=FAO|year=2011|isbn=978-92-5-107096-3|location=http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2500e/i2500e00.pdf|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Budget===
FAO's Regular Programme budget is funded by its members, through contributions set at the FAO Conference. This budget covers core technical work, cooperation and partnerships including the Technical Cooperation Programme, knowledge exchange, policy and advocacy, direction and administration, governance and security.

The total FAO Budget planned for 2016–2017 is USD 2.6 billion. The voluntary contributions provided by members and other partners support mechanical and emergency (including rehabilitation) assistance to governments for clearly defined purposes linked to the results framework, as well as direct support to FAO's core work. The voluntary contributions are expected to reach approximately US$1.6 billion in 2016–2017.

This overall budget covers core technical work, cooperation and partnerships, leading to Food and Agriculture Outcomes at 71 per cent; Core Functions at 11 per cent; the Country Office Network – 5 per cent; Capital and Security Expenditure – 2 per cent; Administration – 6 per cent; and Technical and Cooperation Program – 5 per cent.

==Priority work areas==
FAO has outlined the following priorities in its fight against hunger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What we do|url=http://www.fao.org/about/what-we-do/en/ |publisher=FAO |accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Help eliminate hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition – contribute to the eradication of hunger by facilitating policies and political commitments to support food security and by making sure that up-to-date information about hunger and nutrition challenges and solutions is available and accessible.
* Make agriculture, forestry and fisheries more productive and sustainable – promote evidence-based policies and practices to support highly productive agricultural sectors (crops, livestock, forestry and fisheries), while ensuring that the natural resource base does not suffer in the process.
* Reduce rural poverty – help the rural poor gain access to the resources and services they need – including rural employment and social protection – to forge a path out of poverty.
* Enable inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems – help to build safe and efficient food systems that support smallholder agriculture and reduce poverty and hunger in rural areas.
* Increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises – help countries to prepare for natural and human-caused disasters by reducing their risk and enhancing the resilience of their food and agricultural systems.
Two fundamental areas of work – gender and governance - are fully integrated in the above strategic objective action plans.

==Programmes and achievements==

=== Food ===

==== ''Codex Alimentarius'' ====
FAO and the World Health Organization created the [[Codex Alimentarius Commission]] in 1961 to develop food standards, guidelines and texts such as codes of practice under the Joint FAO/ WHO Food Standards Programme. The main aims of the programme are protecting consumer health, ensuring fair trade and promoting co-ordination of all food standards work undertaken by intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations.

==== World Food Summit ====
{{Main|World Food Summit}}

In 1996, FAO organized the [[World Food Summit]], attended by 112 Heads or Deputy Heads of State and Government. The Summit concluded with the signing of the [[Rome Declaration on World Food Security|Rome Declaration]], which established the goal of halving the number of people who suffer from hunger by the year 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/wfs/index_en.htm |title=World Food Summit archive, FAO |website=fao.org |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, 1,200 civil society organizations (CSOs) from 80 countries participated in an [[NGO]] forum. The forum was critical of the growing industrialization of agriculture and called upon governments – and FAO – to do more to protect the 'Right to Food' of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/pro-cn.htm |title=''Profit for few or food for all'', Final Statement of the NGO Forum |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== TeleFood ====
In 1997, FAO launched TeleFood, a campaign of concerts, sporting events and other activities to harness the power of media, celebrities and concerned citizens to help fight hunger. Since its start, the campaign has generated close to US$28 million, €15 million in donations. Money raised through TeleFood pays for small, sustainable projects that help small-scale farmers produce more food for their families and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/english/newsroom/action/facts_tf_silos.htm |title=About FAO's TeleFood campaign |website=fao.org |access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The projects provide tangible resources, such as fishing equipment, seeds and agricultural implements. They vary enormously, from helping families raise pigs in Venezuela, through creating school gardens in Cape Verde and Mauritania or providing school lunches in Uganda and teaching children to grow food, to raising fish in a leper community in India.

==== FAO Goodwill Ambassadors ====
The [[FAO Goodwill Ambassador]]s Programme was initiated in 1999. The main purpose of the programme is to attract public and media attention to the unacceptable situation that some 1 billion people continue to suffer from chronic hunger and malnutrition in a time of unprecedented plenty. These people lead a life of misery and are denied the most basic of human rights: the right to food.

Governments alone cannot end hunger and undernourishment. Mobilization of the public and private sectors, the involvement of civil society and the pooling of collective and individual resources are all needed if people are to break out of the vicious circle of chronic hunger and undernourishment.

Each of FAO's Goodwill Ambassadors – celebrities from the arts, entertainment, sport and academia such as Nobel Prize winner [[Rita Levi Montalcini]], actress [[Gong Li]], the late singer [[Miriam Makeba]], International Singers [[Ronan Keating]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/getinvolved/ambassadors/ambassadors/ambassadors-ronankeating/en/ |title=Get Involved: Ronan Keating |website=fao.org |accessdate=8 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515054032/http://www.fao.org/getinvolved/ambassadors/ambassadors/ambassadors-ronankeating/en/ |archivedate=15 May 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anggun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/getinvolved/ambassadors/ambassadors/ambassadors-anggun/en/ |title=Get Involved: Anggun |website=fao.org |accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soccer players [[Roberto Baggio]] and [[Raúl González|Raúl]], to name a few – have made a personal and professional commitment to FAO's vision: a food-secure world for present and future generations. Using their talents and influence, the Goodwill Ambassadors draw the old and the young, the rich and the poor into the campaign against world hunger. They aim to make Food for All a reality in the 21st century and beyond.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==== Right to Food Guidelines ====
In 2004 the [[Right to Food Guidelines]] were adopted, offering guidance to states on how to implement their obligations on the [[right to food]].&lt;ref&gt;Olivier de Schutter (2010) "Countries tackling hunger with a right to food approach. Significant progress in implementing the right to food at national scale in Africa, Latin America and South Asia" United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Briefing Note 01, 14 May 2010.

==== Response to food crisis ====
In December 2007, FAO launched its Initiative on Soaring Food Prices to help small producers raise their output and earn more. Under the initiative, FAO contributed to the work of the UN High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis, which produced the Comprehensive Framework for Action. FAO has carried out projects in over 25 countries and inter-agency missions in nearly 60, scaled up its monitoring through the Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture, provided policy advice to governments while supporting their efforts to increase food production, and advocated for more investment in agriculture. s also worked hand-in-hand with the European Union. One example of its work is a US$10.2 million, €7.5 billion scheme to distribute and multiply quality seeds in Haiti,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/haiti's-seed-multiplication-programme-yields-fruits-2009082133773.html |title=Haiti's seed multiplication programme yields fruits |work=Jeune Afrique |date=21 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827021358/http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/haiti's-seed-multiplication-programme-yields-fruits-2009082133773.html |archive-date=27 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has significantly increased food production, thereby providing cheaper food and boosting

==== FAO–EU partnership ====
In May 2009, FAO and the European Union signed an initial aid package worth €125 million to support small farmers in countries hit hard by rising food prices. The aid package falls under the EU's €1 billion Food Facility, set up with the UN Secretary-General's High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis and FAO to focus on programmes that will have a quick but lasting impact on food security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/europeanunion/eu-in-action/eu-food-facility-details/en/ |title=FAO and EU Food Facility |website=fao.org |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; FAO is receiving a total of around €200 million for work in 25 countries, of which €15.4 million goes to Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-09/15/content_12052564.htm |title=UN food agency assists farmers in Zimbabwe |work=Xinhua |date=14 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011222156/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-09/15/content_12052564.htm |archive-date=11 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Food security programmes ====
The Special Programme for Food Security is FAO's flagship initiative for reaching the goal of halving the number of hungry in the world by 2015 (currently estimated at close to 1 billion people), as part of its commitment to the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. Through projects in over 100 countries worldwide, the programme promotes effective, tangible solutions to the elimination of hunger, undernourishment and poverty. Currently 102 countries are engaged in the programme and of these approximately 30 have begun shifting from pilot to national programmes. To maximize the impact of its work, FAO strongly promotes national ownership and local empowerment in the countries in which it operates.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==== Online campaign against hunger ====
The 1billionhungry project became the EndingHunger campaign in April 2011. Spearheaded by FAO in partnership with other UN agencies and private nonprofit groups, the EndingHunger movement pushes the boundaries of conventional public advocacy. It builds on the success in 2010 of The 1billonhungry project and the subsequent chain of public events that led to the collection of over three million signatures on a global petition to end hunger (www.EndingHunger.org). The petition was originally presented to representatives of world governments at a ceremony in Rome on 30 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edu-lib.us/westernfarmpress.com/government/1billionhungry-project-petition-presented-world-leaders |title=1billionhungry project petition presented to world leaders |publisher=Westerfarmpress.com |date=30 November 2010 |accessdate=9 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923233814/http://www.edu-lib.us/westernfarmpress.com/government/1billionhungry-project-petition-presented-world-leaders |archive-date=23 September 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The web and partnerships are two pivotal and dynamic aspects of EndingHunger. The campaign relies on the assistance of organizations and institutions that can facilitate the project's diffusion, by placing banners on their own websites or organizing events aimed to raise awareness of the project. In its 2011 season, the campaign expanded its multimedia content, pursued mutual visibility arrangements with partner organizations, and sharpened its focus on 14- to 25-year-olds, who were encouraged to understand their potential as a social movement to push for the end of hunger.

Moreover, the EndingHunger project is a viral communication campaign, renewing and expanding its efforts to build the movement through Facebook, Twitter and other social networks. Those who sign the petition can spread the link of the EndingHunger website to their friends, via social media or mail, in order to gain awareness and signatures for the petition. The next interim objective is to grow the EndingHunger movement's Facebook community to 1 million members. As with the petition, the more people who get involved, the more powerful the message to governments: "We are no longer willing to accept the fact that hundreds of millions live in chronic hunger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endinghunger.org/ |title=EndingHunger |accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups and individuals can also decide on their own to organize an event about the project, simply by gathering friends, whistles, T-shirts and banners (whistles and T-shirts can be ordered, and petition sign sheets downloaded, on the endinghunger.org website) and thereby alert people about chronic hunger by using the yellow whistle.

The original 1billionhungry campaign borrowed as its slogan the line "I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!", used by [[Peter Finch]] in the 1976 film, ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Chayefsky, Paddy and Lumet, Sidney (Director)|date=1976|title=Network|medium=Motion picture|location=United States|publisher=Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, United Artists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the yellow whistle has been the campaign symbol from the start, from 1billionhungry to Ending Hunger. (The creative concept was provided by the McCann Erickson Italy Communication Agency.) It symbolizes the fact that we are "blowing the whistle" on the silent disaster of hunger. It is both a symbol and – at many live events taking place around the world – a physical means of expressing frustration and making some noise about the hunger situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahgingos.org/documents/.../1BH--background_document.doc |title=The 1billionhungry project |publisher=AD HOC Group of INGOs |format=DOC |accessdate=9 January 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both The 1billionhungry and the EndingHunger campaigns have continued to attract UN Goodwill Ambassadors from the worlds of music and cinema, literature, sport, activism and government. Some of the well known individuals who have become involved include former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, former presidents of Chile Ricardo Lagos and Michelle Bachelet, actress Susan Sarandon, actors Jeremy Irons and Raul Bova, singers [[Céline Dion]] and [[Anggun]], authors Isabelle Allende and Andrea Camilleri, musician Chucho Valdés and Olympic track-and-field legend Carl Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/42158/icode/ |title=FAO launches anti-hunger petition |website=fao.org |date=11 May 2010 |accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== International Plant Protection Convention ====
FAO created the [[International Plant Protection Convention]] or IPPC in 1952. This international treaty organization works to prevent the international spread of pests and plant diseases in both cultivated and wild plants. Among its functions are the maintenance of lists of plant pests, tracking of pest outbreaks, and coordination of technical assistance between member nations. As of July 2018, 183 contracting parties have ratified the treaty.

==== Alliance Against Hunger and Malnutrition ====
{{Redirect|AAHM|the American society dedicated to [[medical history]]|American Association for the History of Medicine}}
The Alliance Against Hunger and Malnutrition (AAHM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaahm.org/ |title=theaahm.org |website=theaahm.org|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to address how countries and organizations can be more effective in advocating and carrying out actions to address hunger and malnutrition. As a global partnership, AAHM creates global connections between local, regional, national and international institutions that share the goals of fighting hunger and malnutrition. The organization works to address food security by enhancing resources and knowledge sharing and strengthening hunger activities within countries and across state lines at the regional and international levels.

Following the World Food Summit, the Alliance was initially created in 2002 as the 'International Alliance Against Hunger (IAAH)' to strengthen and coordinate national efforts in the fight against hunger and malnutrition. The mission of the Alliance originates from the first and eight UN Millennium Development Goals; reducing the number of people that suffer from hunger in half by 2015 (preceded by the "Rome Declaration" in 1996) and developing a global partnership for development. The Alliance was founded by the Rome-based food agencies – the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/ |title=fao.org |accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN World Food Programme (WFP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfp.org/ |title=wfp.org |accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifad.org/ |title=ifad.org |accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and Bioversity International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bioversityinternational.org/ |title=bioversityinternational.org |accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AAHM connects top-down and bottom-up anti-hunger development initiatives, linking governments, UN organizations, and NGOs together in order to increase effectiveness through unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaahm.org/ |title=Alliance Against Hunger and Malnutrition |publisher=theaahm.org |date=17 March 2011 |accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Integrated pest management ====
During the 1990s, FAO took a leading role in the promotion of [[integrated pest management]] for rice production in Asia. Hundreds of thousands of farmers were trained using an approach known as the [[Farmer Field School (FFS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.comunityipm.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312052945/http://www.comunityipm.org/ |archive-date=12 March 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many of the programmes managed by FAO, the funds for Farmer Field Schools came from bilateral Trust Funds, with Australia, Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland acting as the leading donors. FAO's efforts in this area have drawn praise from NGOs that have otherwise criticized much of the work of the organization.

==== Transboundary pests and diseases ====
FAO established an ''Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases'' in 1994, focusing on the control of diseases like [[rinderpest]], [[foot-and-mouth disease]] and [[avian flu]] by helping governments coordinate their responses. One key element is the ''Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme'', which has advanced to a stage where large tracts of Asia and Africa have now been free of the cattle disease rinderpest for an extended period of time. Meanwhile, ''Locust Watch'' monitors the worldwide locust situation and keeps affected countries and donors informed of expected developments.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==== Global Partnership Initiative for Plant Breeding Capacity Building ====
[[File:FAO Food Price Index.png|The Food Price Index (FAO) 1990-2012|thumb|right]]

The Global Partnership Initiative for Plant Breeding Capacity Building (GIPB) is a global partnership dedicated to increasing plant breeding capacity building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://km.fao.org/gipb/about-gipb/who-we-are/en/ |title=About GIPB |publisher=FAO |accessdate=3 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414233309/http://km.fao.org/gipb/about-gipb/who-we-are/en/ |archivedate=14 April 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of GIPB is to enhance the capacity of developing countries to improve crops for food security and sustainable development through better plant breeding and delivery systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://km.fao.org/gipb/about-gipb/objectives/en/ |title=Objectives |publisher=FAO |accessdate=3 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414162813/http://km.fao.org/gipb/about-gipb/objectives/en/ |archivedate=14 April 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal is to ensure that a critical mass of plant breeders, leaders, managers and technicians, donors and partners are linked together through an effective global network.

Increasing capacity building for plant breeding in developing countries is critical for the achievement of meaningful results in poverty and hunger reduction and to reverse the current worrisome trends. Plant breeding is a well recognized science capable of widening the genetic and adaptability base of cropping systems, by combining conventional selection techniques and modern technologies. It is essential to face and prevent the recurrence of crises such as that
of the soaring food prices and to respond to the increasing demands for crop based sources of energy.

==== Investment in agriculture ====
FAO's technical cooperation department hosts an Investment Centre that promotes greater investment in agriculture and rural development by helping developing countries identify and formulate sustainable agricultural policies, programmes and projects. It mobilizes funding from multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, regional development banks and international funds as well as FAO resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/tc/about_en.asp |title=About FAO |publisher=FAO |accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) ====

The Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) Partnership Initiative was conceptualized and presented by Parviz Koohafkan the Task Manager of Chapter 10 of Agenda 21 in Food and Agricultural Organization of United Nations, FAO in 2002 during World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}  This UN Partnership Initiative aims to identify, support and safeguard Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems and their livelihoods, agricultural and associated biodiversity, landscapes, knowledge systems and cultures around the world. The GIAHS Partnership recognizes the crucial importance of the well-being of family farming communities in an integrated approach while directing activities towards sustainable agriculture and rural development.

====Animal Genetic Resources====
FAO has a unit focused on [[Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|Animal Genetic Resources]], which are defined as “those animal species that are used, or may be used, for the production of food and agriculture, and the populations within each of them. These populations within each species can be classified as wild and feral populations, landraces and primary populations, standardised breeds, selected lines, varieties, strains and any conserved genetic material; all of which are currently categorized as Breeds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-y1100m/y1100m03.htm |title=Annex 2: Working Definitions for Use in Developing Country Reports and Providing Supporting Data |journal=Animal Genetics Resources Information: Special Issue State of the World |volume=30 |year=2001 |pages=35–40 |via=Web |access-date=19 May 2016 |publisher=FAO}}&lt;/ref&gt; FAO assists countries in implementation of the [[Global plan of action for animal genetic resources|Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources]]. FAO supports a variety of ''[[ex situ conservation|ex situ]]'' and ''[[in situ conservation|in situ]]'' conservation strategies including [[cryoconservation of animal genetic resources]].

=== Forestry ===
{{See also|Forestry Information Centre}}

One of FAO's strategic goals is the sustainable management of the world's forests. The ''Forestry Department'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/en/ |title=Forestry |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |website=www.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; works to balance social and environmental considerations with the economic needs of rural populations living in forest areas. FAO serves as a neutral forum for policy dialogue, as a reliable source of information on forests and trees and as a provider of expert technical assistance and advice to help countries develop and implement effective national forest programmes.

FAO is both a global clearinghouse for information on [[forest]]s and forest resources and a facilitator that helps build countries' local capacity to provide their own national forest data. In collaboration with member countries, FAO carries out periodic global assessments of forest resources, which are made available through reports, publications and the FAO's Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/index_en.htm |title=Home |website=www.fao.org |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA)|Global Forest Resources Assessment]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/forest-resources-assessment/en/|title=Global Forest Resources Assessments |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |website=www.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides comprehensive reporting on forests worldwide every five years. FRA 2015 is the most recent global assessment. The results, data and analyses are available online in different formats, including the FAO synthesis report ''Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015: How are forests changing?'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4793e.pdf FAO synthesis report ''Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015: How are forests changing?'']&lt;/ref&gt; the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 Desk Reference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4808e.pdf |title=Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 Desk Reference |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing summary tables, 234 country reports&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/forest-resources-assessment/current-assessment/country-reports/en/ |title=Country reports - Global Forest Resources Assessments |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |website=www.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the FRA 2015 Infographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4868e.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006232648/http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4868e.pdf |archive-date=6 October 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in 2015, the journal ''Forest Ecology and Management'' published a special issue, ''Changes in Global Forest Resources from 1990 to 2015''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/3/be7b339c-dbe9-4d48-ac73-2a8ba1ae7ee2/i4895e.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007025857/http://www.fao.org/3/be7b339c-dbe9-4d48-ac73-2a8ba1ae7ee2/i4895e.pdf |archive-date=7 October 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Changes in Global Forest Resources from 1990 to 2015 |url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4895e/index.html |publisher=Elsevier |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; reporting forest change over the period 1990–2015.

Every two years, FAO publishes the ''State of the World's Forests'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/sofo/en/ |title=Forestry |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |website=www.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3710e.html |title=State of the World's Forests |year=2014 |location=Rome, Italy |publisher=FAO |website=fao.org |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a major report covering current and emerging issues facing the forestry sector.

Since 1947, FAO has published the FAO Yearbook of Forest Products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FAO Yearbook of Forest Products |url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/statistics/80570/en/ |website=FAO Yearbook of Forest Products |publisher=FAO}}&lt;/ref&gt; a compilation of statistical data on basic forest products from over 100 countries and territories of the world. It contains data on the volume of production; and the volume, value and direction of trade in forest products.

''[[Unasylva]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/unasylva/en/ |title=Unasylva |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |website=www.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; FAO's peer-reviewed journal on forestry, has been published in English, French and Spanish on a regular basis since 1947, the longest-running multilingual forestry journal in the world.

The FAO is an official sponsor of [[International Day of Forests]], on 21 March each year, as proclaimed by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 28 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/forestry/36014-063ec88fa19cab1dfe473d7813290b32.pdf "International Day of Forests,"] United Nations General Assembly, 28 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every 6 years since 1926, FAO and a host member state hold the [[World Forestry Congress]]. It is a forum for the sharing of knowledge and experience regarding the conservation, management and use of the world's forests, and covers such issues as international dialogue, socio-economic and institutional aspects, and forest policies.
 
The Forestry Department is also organized geographically in several groups covering the whole world's forest ecosystems. One of them is the Silva mediterranea workgroup, covering the pan-mediterranean region.

=== Fisheries ===
[[File:ER Kvaran being filmed, Sri Lanka, Ca. 1956.jpeg|thumb|right|FAO fisheries expert, [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], 1950s]]
The FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department is defined through its vision and mission statements:
* ''Vision'': A world in which responsible and sustainable use of fisheries and aquaculture resources makes an appreciable contribution to human well-being, food security and poverty alleviation.
* ''Mission'': To strengthen global governance and the managerial and technical capacities of members and to lead consensus-building towards improved conservation and utilization of aquatic resources.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The work of the Fisheries and Aquaculture Department centers on the "Sustainable management and use of fisheries and aquaculture resource," embracing normative as well as operational activities, whether implemented from headquarters or from the field.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The UN member state that is a non-member of the FAO is [[Liechtenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/Legal/member-e.htm |title=FAO members list |website=fao.org |accessdate=15 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61m1XJgRL?url=http://www.fao.org/Legal/member-e.htm |archivedate=17 September 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2107.html |title=CIA World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries may denote specific representatives to the FAO, for instance the [[United States Ambassador to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], who has ambassador rank and is also part of the [[United States Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome]].

==Criticism==

===1970s, 80s, 90s===
There has been public criticism of FAO for at least 30 years. Dissatisfaction with the organization's performance was among the reasons for the creation of two new organizations after the World Food Conference in 1974, namely the [[World Food Council]] and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]]; by the early eighties there was intense rivalry among these organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9507E1DA1E39F93AA35752C1A967948260 |title=Critics Say Rivalries Hurt Work of Food Groups |work=The New York Times |year=1981 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the [[World Food Programme]], which started as an experimental three-year programme under FAO, was growing in size and independence, with the Directors of FAO and WFP struggling for power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.unhistory.org/pdf/ingram_cover.pdf |title=Bread and Stones: Leadership and the Struggle to Reform the United Nations World Food Programme |author=James Ingram |publisher=Booksurge |year=2006 |isbn=1-4196-2595-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1989, the organization came under attack from [[The Heritage Foundation]], a conservative think tank based in Washington, DC. The Foundation wrote that "The sad fact is that the FAO has become essentially irrelevant in combating hunger. A bloated bureaucracy known for the mediocrity of its work and the inefficiency of its staff the FAO in recent years has become increasingly politicised".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/InternationalOrganizations/bg626.cfm |title=The U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization: Becoming Part of the Problem |author=Juliana Geran Pilon |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |date=4 January 1988 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612122734/http://www.heritage.org/Research/InternationalOrganizations/bg626.cfm |archivedate=12 June 2008 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September of the same year, the journal ''[[Society (journal)|Society]]'' published a series of articles about FAO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g13418201246/?p=44d8e35f45444d2e9e8fef258ed2a942&amp;pi=0 |title=Society, Volume 25, Number 6, September 1988 |publisher=Springerlink.com |date=5 April 2002 |accessdate=15 October 2010}}{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that included a contribution from the Heritage Foundation and a response by FAO staff member, Richard Lydiker, who was later described by the Danish Minister for Agriculture (who had herself resigned from the organization) as "FAO's chief spokesman for non-transparency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webzoom.freewebs.com/shequality/6th%20100%20Questions%20on%20Democracy.doc |title=A Sixth 100 Questions on Democracy |publisher=Council for Parity Democracy |date=22 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edouard Saouma]], the Director-General of FAO, was also criticized in [[Graham Hancock]]'s book ''Lords of Poverty'', published in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0871134691/|title=The Lords of Poverty: The Power, Prestige, and Corruption of the International Aid Business|first=Graham|last=Hancock|date=10 January 1994|publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.centeronfic.org/v2/equip/publications/articles/LordsPovertyServantsPoor.pdf | title=Lords of Poverty and Servants of the Poor | author=Amy Sherman | journal=Stewardship Journal | year=Winter 1991 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102171657/http://www.centeronfic.org/v2/equip/publications/articles/LordsPovertyServantsPoor.pdf |archive-date=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mention is made of Saouma's "fat pay packet", his "autocratic" management style, and his "control over the flow of public information". Hancock concluded that "One gets the sense from all of this of an institution that has lost its way, departed from its purely humanitarian and developmental mandate, become confused about its place in the world – about exactly what it is doing, and why." Despite the criticism, Edouard Saouma served as DG for three consecutive terms from 1976 to 1993.

In 1990, the US State Department expressed the view that "The Food and Agriculture Organization has lagged behind other UN organizations in responding to US desires for improvements in program and budget processes to enhance value for money spent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/briefing/dispatch/1990/html/Dispatchv1no05.html |magazine=Dispatch |volume=1 |issue=5 |date=October 1, 1990 |title=US Support for Additional UN Action Against Iraq |publisher=US Department of State |via=dosfan.lib.uic.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, in 1991, ''[[The Ecologist]]'' magazine produced a special issue under the heading "The UN Food and Agriculture Organization: Promoting World Hunger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The UN Food and Agriculture Organization: Promoting World Hunger |url=http://exacteditions.theecologist.org/exact/browse/307/308/5643/1/1 |journal=The Ecologist |volume=21 |issue=2 |date=March–April 1991 |accessdate=15 October 2010 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728094656/http://exacteditions.theecologist.org/exact/browse/307/308/5643/1/1 |archive-date=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine included articles that questioned FAO's policies and practices in forestry, [[fisheries]], [[aquaculture]], and [[pest control]]. The articles were written by experts such as [[Helena Norberg-Hodge]], [[Vandana Shiva]], [[Edward Goldsmith]], [[Miguel Altieri|Miguel A. Altieri]] and [[Barbara Dinham]].

=== 2000s ===
The 2002 Food Summit organized by FAO was considered to be a waste of time by many of the official participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2042664.stm|title=Food summit waste of time|publisher=BBC News|date=13 June 2002 |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social movements, farmers, fisherfolk, pastoralists, indigenous peoples, environmentalists, women's organizations, trade unions and NGOs expressed their "collective disappointment in, and rejection of the official Declaration of the&amp;nbsp;... Summit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://practicalaction.org/?id=wfs_statements |title=NGO/CSO Forum for Food Sovereignty, final statement |publisher=Practicalaction.org |date=12 June 2002 |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, FAO produced a controversial report called 'Agricultural Biotechnology: meeting the needs of the poor?'. The report claimed that "agricultural [[biotechnology]] has real potential as a new tool in the war on hunger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/focus/2004/41655/index.html |title=Biotechnology: meeting the needs of the poor? |website=www.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the report, more than 650 organizations from around the world signed an open letter in which they said "FAO has broken its commitment to civil society and peasants' organisations". The letter complained that organizations representing the interests of farmers had not been consulted, that FAO was siding with the biotechnology industry and, consequently, that the report "raises serious questions about the independence and intellectual integrity of an important United Nations agency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grain.org/front/?id=24 |title=FAO declare war on farmers not hunger |publisher=Grain.org |date=16 June 2004 |accessdate=15 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208111517/http://www.grain.org/front/?id=24 |archivedate=8 February 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Director General of FAO responded immediately, stating that decisions on biotechnology must "be taken at the international level by competent bodies" (in other words, not by [[non-governmental organization]]s). He acknowledged, however, that "biotechnology research is essentially driven by the world's top ten [[multinational corporations|transnational corporations]]" and "the private sector protects its results with [[patents]] in order to earn from its investment and it concentrates on products that have no relevance to food in developing countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2004/46429/index.html |title=Statement by FAO Director General |website=fao.org |date=16 June 2004 |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, a British newspaper published the resignation letter of [[Louise Fresco]], one of eight Assistant Directors-General of FAO. In her letter, Fresco stated that "the Organization has been unable to adapt to a new era", that "our contribution and reputation have declined steadily" and "its leadership has not proposed bold options to overcome this crisis".&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1774156,00.html "Resignation letter of Louise Fresco, ADG, FAO", ''Guardian'', 14 May 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 32nd Session of FAO's Committee on World Food Security in 2006, attended by 120 countries, was widely criticized by non-governmental organizations, but largely ignored by the mainstream media. [[Oxfam]] called for an end to the talk-fests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.oxfam.org/en/news/pressreleases2006/pr061030_hunger |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211155210/http://www.oxfam.org/en/news/pressreleases2006/pr061030_hunger |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 February 2007 |title=Global hunger: act now or go home |date=30 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Via Campesina]] issued a statement that criticised FAO's policy of Food Security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=La Via Campesina |url=http://www.viacampesina.org/main_en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=233&amp;Itemid=27 |title=World Food Summit: 10 years of empty promises. Time for food sovereignty! |date=22 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210055905/http://www.viacampesina.org/main_en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=233&amp;Itemid=27 |archive-date=10 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 October 2007, the final report of an Independent External Evaluation of FAO was published. More than 400 pages in length, the evaluation was the first of its kind in the history of the Organization. It had been commissioned by decision of the 33rd Session of the FAO Conference in November 2005. The report concluded that "The Organization is today in a financial and programme crisis" but "the problems affecting the Organization today can all be solved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/pbe/pbee/en/219/index.html |title=Evaluation at FAO |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |website=www.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the problems noted by the IEE were: "The Organization has been conservative and slow to adapt"; "FAO currently has a heavy and costly bureaucracy", and "The capacity of the Organization is declining and many of its core competencies are now imperilled". Among the solutions offered were: "A new Strategic Framework", "institutional culture change and reform of administrative and management systems". In conclusion the IEE stated that, "If FAO did not exist it would need to be invented".

The official response from FAO came on 29 October 2007. It indicated that management supported the principal conclusion in the report of the IEE on the need for "reform with growth" so as to have an FAO "fit for this century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2007/1000692/index.html |title=Official FAO response to evaluation report |website=fao.org |date=29 October 2007 |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, hundreds of FAO staff signed a petition in support of the IEE recommendations, calling for "a radical shift in management culture and spirit, depoliticization of appointments, restoration of trust between staff and management, [and] setting strategic priorities of the organization".&lt;ref&gt;''For a Renewal of FAO'', on-line petition, November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, a Special Conference of FAO member countries agreed a US$42.6 million (€38.6 million), three-year Immediate Plan of Action for "reform with growth", as recommended by the IEE. Under the plan US$21.8 million would be spent on overhauling the financial procedures, hierarchies and human resources management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/International_Business/UN_food_agency_approves_426_million_reform_plan/articleshow/3745635.cms|title=UN food agency approves US$42.6 million, €38.6 million reform plan|work=Times of India|date=22 November 2008|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 FAO was criticized by ''[[The Economist]]'' for giving a diploma to Venezuela for being one of 72 countries that had “reached the UN Millennium Development Goal of halving the percentage of their populations suffering from hunger”. It argued that the positive conclusion reached by FAO about the performance of a country experiencing major economic difficulties was based on false statistics and that the percentage of the Venezuelan population suffering from hunger had actually increased. It quoted FAO as saying that it had no reason to doubt the Venezuelan statistics.

In 2016/17 FAO was heavily criticized for recruiting [[Nadine Heredia|Nadine Heredia Alarcón de Humala]], wife of the former president of Peru, [[Ollanta Humala]], to a senior position, at a time when she was being investigated by Peru following corruption allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nikolau |first1=Lisa |title=U.N. job for former Peru first lady held up by inquiry back home |url=http://www.humanosphere.org/world-politics/2016/12/u-n-job-for-former-peru-first-lady-held-up-by-inquiry-back-home/|website=Humanosphere|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nadine 'still on FAO payroll,' agency quoted saying |url=http://www.italianinsider.it/?q=node/5310 |website=The Italian Insider |accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics included [[Transparency International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=José Ugaz |title=Nadine Heredia debió postergar cargo en la FAO |url=http://larepublica.pe/politica/825313-jose-ugaz-nadine-heredia-debio-postergar-cargo-en-la-fao |website=La República |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of April 2017, FAO staff unions addressed the organization’s Governing Council to complain about the practice of issuing short-term contracts that "exploit employees without providing job security, social security and paid leave".  Other complaints included the increasing centralization of management processes, despite claims that FAO was being decentralized, and the failure to follow [[United Nations]] recommendations regarding increasing the retirement age. The staff representative also complained about the high percentage of unfilled positions, increasing the workload for others who were under pressure to deliver more with less. She also noted that contacts between Management and the staff bodies were becoming less and less frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Filipowicz |first1=Jan |title=FAO 'exploiting employees' without job security, unions say |url=http://www.italianinsider.it/?q=node/5323 |website=Italian Insider |accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World food crisis ===
In May 2008, while talking about the ongoing [[2007–2008 world food price crisis|world food crisis]], President [[Abdoulaye Wade]] of [[Senegal]] expressed the opinion that FAO was "a waste of money" and that "we must scrap it". Wade said that FAO was itself largely to blame for the price rises, and that the organization's work was duplicated by other bodies that operated more efficiently, like the UN's [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7383628.stm|title=UN food body should be scrapped|publisher=BBC News|date=5 May 2008|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this criticism may have had more to do with personal animosity between the President and the Director-General, himself a Senegalese, particularly in light of the significant differences in the work carried out by the two organizations.

In 2008, the FAO sponsored the [[High-Level Conference on World Food Security]]. The summit was notable for the lack of agreement over the issue of [[biofuels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/06/food.biofuels|title=Food summit fails to agree on biofuels, Guardian 06 June 2008|work=Guardian|date= 6 June 2008|accessdate=15 October 2010|location=London|first=Julian|last=Borger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The response to the summit among [[non-governmental organization]]s was mixed, with [[Oxfam]] stating that "the summit in Rome was an important first step in tackling the food crisis but greater action is now needed",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.oxfam.org/en/news/2008/pr080506_un_summit_rome_food_crisis_oxfam |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612122515/http://www.oxfam.org/en/news/2008/pr080506_un_summit_rome_food_crisis_oxfam |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 June 2008 |title=Rome summit 'important first step' but much more needed says Oxfam |date=5 June 2008 |publisher=Oxfam }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Maryam Rahmanian of Iran's Centre for Sustainable Development said "We are dismayed and disgusted to see the food crisis used to further the policies that have led us to the food crisis in the first place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=210194 |title=Farmers 'disgusted' with food summit |work=Daily Despatch Online |date=7 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with previous food summits, civil society organizations held a parallel meeting and issued their own declaration to "reject the corporate industrial and energy-intensive model of production and consumption that is the basis of continuing crises."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.viacampesina.org/main_en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=556&amp;Itemid=38 |title=Civil Society Declaration of the Terra Preta Forum |website=La Via Campesina |date=5 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210060535/http://www.viacampesina.org/main_en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=556&amp;Itemid=38 |archive-date=10 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== FAO renewal ==
The FAO Conference in November 2007 unanimously welcomed the IEE report and established a Conference Committee for the Follow-up to the Independent External Evaluation of FAO (CoC-IEE) to be chaired by the Independent Chairperson of Council, and open to full participation by all Members. The CoC-IEE was charged to review the IEE report and its recommendations and develop an Immediate Plan of Action (IPA) for their implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Conference Committee for the Follow-up to the Independent External Evaluation of FAO |url=http://www.fao.org/iee-follow-up-committee/en/ |publisher=FAO |website=fao.org|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive programme of organizational reform and culture change began in 2008 after the release of an Independent External Evaluation. Headquarters restructuring and delegation of decision making created a flatter more responsive structure and reduced costs. Modernizing and streamlining of administrative and operational processes took place. Improved internal teamwork and closer external partnerships coupled with upgrading of IT infrastructure and greater autonomy of FAO's decentralized offices now allows the Organization to respond quickly where needs are greatest. As FAO is primarily a knowledge based organization, investing in human resources is a top priority. Capacity building including a leadership programme, employee rotation and a new junior professional programme were established. Individual performance management, an ethics and ombudsman officer and an independent office of evaluation were designed to improve performance through learning and strengthened oversight.

In January 2012, the Director-General [[José Graziano da Silva]] acted upon the commitment made during his campaign to bring the FAO reform to a successful and anticipated completion. In addition, the new Director-General shifted the focus of the reform process to realization of its benefits and mainstreaming the reform into the work of the Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/mg881e/mg881e.pdf |title=FAO Reform |website=fao.org |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1861">The '''Friends of Garrity Creek''' (FGC) is a political organization in Contra Costa County, California which promote the preservation of [[Garrity Creek]].

== Overview ==

The Friends was formed in 2001 when development on steep slopes near the creek's artesian spring source threatened its existence and quality.  The friends were eventually successful in preventing the later determined illegal development which was in violation of grade limits for steepness.

The FGC fund-raise money and work to create awareness of the watershed and its importance to the area.  The creek passes through [[Hilltop Green, Richmond, California|Hilltop Green]], under Interstate 80 via pipes, down a small canyon alongside [[Hilltop Plaza Shopping Center]], and then through culverts to a gorge where it has been dammed to create [[Hilltop Lake]]. At that point the creek appears as a small lake, surrounded by [[Hilltop Lake Park]]. The creek then continues through undeveloped land to its mouth at the shoreline of [[San Pablo Bay]].  The friends occasionally have organized volunteer events to clean up trash and to remove invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/article.cfm?archiveDate=06-15-04&amp;storyID=19068 Berkeley Is Not Alone in Saving Creeks, Natural Habitat], by Barbara A.

The '''General Service Unit''' ('''GSU''') is a [[paramilitary]] wing in the [[National Police Service of Kenya]], consisting of highly trained police officers, transported by seven dedicated [[Cessna]]s and three [[Bell Helicopter Textron|Bell helicopters]]&lt;ref&gt;Kenya Security [http://www.iss.co.za/Af/profiles/Kenya/SecInfo.html Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616083427/http://www.iss.co.za/Af/profiles/Kenya/SecInfo.html |date=16 June 2008 }} –  [http://www.iss.co.za/ Institute for Security Studies] retrieved on 28 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Having been in existence since the late 1940s, the GSU has fought in a number of conflicts in and around Kenya, including the 1963 – 1969 [[Shifta War]] and the [[1982 Kenyan coup]].&lt;ref&gt;Sabar p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; The Kenyan police outlines the objectives of the GSU as follows: to deal with situations affecting internal security throughout the Republic, to be an operational force that is not intended for use on duties of a permanent static nature, and primarily, to be a reserve force to deal with special operations and civil disorders.&lt;ref name="Police"/&gt;

==History==

Initially created as the Emergency Company or Regular Police Reserve in 1948, the GSU began as a unit of 50 men armed with Bren guns carriers and armoured cars&lt;ref name="Police"&gt;Kenyan Police [http://www.kenyapolice.go.ke/general%20service%20unit.asp page] retrieved on 24 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and was involved in a number of uprisings including the [[Mau Mau Uprising]] before being renamed the General Service Unit in September 1953.&lt;ref name="Police"/&gt; The newly designated GSU consisted of 47 European officers and 1058 Africans divided into 5 regional companies each consisting of a number of 39-man platoons.&lt;ref name="Police"/&gt; In 1957 further reorganisations took place and the GSU was brought under one commander, a Mr. S. G. Thomson. In 1961 the unit left Kenya for the first time to deal with civil unrest in [[Zanzibar]], and then from 1963 until 1969 the GSU fought the secessionists during the [[Shifta War]].

During the 1990s the GSU worked in central Kenya to quell socialist political unrest and demonstrations against the Kenyan government, such as the [[Saba Saba Day]] (7 July) celebrations of 1990, where 30 people were killed as the police and General Service Units took action.&lt;ref&gt;Barkan p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in July 2005, troops of the GSU were sent to northern Kenya to seek out those responsible for the deaths of 76 people, 22 of them children, at a school in the area.&lt;ref name="news1"&gt;BBC News article [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4685461.stm ''Crack troops seek Kenya killers'']&lt;/ref&gt; The GSU helped prevent further friction between feuding [[Gabra people|Gabra]] and [[Borana Oromo|Borana]] communities when they were transported to the region by two police and two military helicopters, as well as two ministers from the Kenyan government.&lt;ref name="news1"/&gt; Currently, the GSU has around 5,000 paramilitary troops, of which 2000 are the [[Israel]]i trained and battle hardened 'Recce group'. It is regulated under chapter nine of the Kenya Police Force Standing Orders.&lt;ref name="Police"/&gt;

==Personnel==

Originally, GSU members were drawn from the existing ranks of the Kenyan Police force, were from a number of ethnic backgrounds, and were trained in the Kenya Police College and placed on a two-year tour of duty.&lt;ref name="Police"/&gt; However, with the increase of Africanisation in 1963, the majority of members were by 1967 from native Kenyan tribes such as the [[Luo (family of ethnic groups)|Luo]] or the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]]&lt;ref name="Provizer p. 343"&gt;Provizer p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; who total 5.9 million, equal to about 13% and 7.4 million, equal to about 22% of [[Demographics of Kenya|Kenya's total population]], respectively&lt;ref&gt;CIA World Factbook [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ke.html#People figures] retrieved on 28 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, all GSU members have been trained at the GSU-specific Training School in [[Embakasi]] and its Field Training Camp in [[Magadi]], on 10-month-long courses, with further 5-month long courses required for promotion.&lt;ref name="Police"/&gt; As with various branches of the Kenyan armed forces,&lt;ref name="Provizer p. 343"/&gt; the GSU also sends its officers to Great Britain to be trained in such facilities as the [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] and [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]].&lt;ref&gt;Provizer p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisational Structure==

The GSU is organised in companies each under a company commander. Four of these companies have commanding officers and they are regarded as the 'big four'
These are 
* The GSU Training School at Embakasi
* The Recce Company based at Ruiru
* The Headquarters Company based at Ruaraka Nairobi, and
* The (Presidential) Guard Company 'G' coy whose officers are solely charged with the duties of protecting the various state houses and lodges.

The other companies are listed in alphabetical order starting from 'A' company to 'Q' company. There is no 'o' company.
Each company consists of three platoons and the company headquarters personnel. Originally a platoon consisted of 30 personnel but nowadays a platoon can have as many as 60 members.

The '''State Planning Committee''', commonly known as '''Gosplan''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|Госпла́н}}, {{IPA-ru|ɡɐsˈpɫan|pron}}),&lt;ref&gt;
The word "Gosplan" is an abbreviation of '''''Gos'''udarstvenniy Komitet po '''Plan'''irovaniyu'' (Государственный комитет по планированию, "State Committee for Planning".)
&lt;/ref&gt;
was the agency responsible for [[economic planning|central economic planning]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. Established in 1921 and remaining in existence until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Gosplan had as its main task the creation  and administration of a series of [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plans]] governing the [[economy of the Soviet Union|economy of the USSR]].

==History==

===Economic background===

The time of the [[October Revolution]] and the [[Russian Civil War]] which followed was a period of virtual economic collapse. Production and distribution of necessary commodities were severely tested as factories were shuttered and major cities such as [[Petrograd]] were depopulated, with urban residents returning to the countryside to claim a place in land redistribution and in order to avoid the unemployment, lack of food, and lack of fuel which had become endemic. By 1919 [[hyperinflation in early Soviet Russia|hyperinflation]] had emerged, further pushing the struggling economic system of [[Soviet Russia]] towards total collapse.

An ''ad hoc'' system remembered to history as [[War Communism|Military Communism]] emerged. The Soviet government's [[Council of Labor and Defense|Council of Workers' and Peasants' Defense]] rushed from economic bottleneck to economic bottleneck in a frenzied effort to sustain what remained of Russian industry on behalf of the [[Red Army]], locked in a life or death struggle with the anti-Bolshevik [[White movement]], backed by the foreign military intervention of [[Great Britain]], [[France]], [[Japan]], the [[United States of America]], and other countries. In the countryside [[Prodrazvyorstka|food requisitions]], often backed by brute force, took place under the nominal auspices of the [[People's Commissariat of Agriculture]].

In the midst of such chaos the mere idea of long-term economic planning remained a utopian dream during these first years of existence of Soviet Russia. It was not until the Civil War had drawn to a successful conclusion for the [[Bolshevik]]s in 1920 that serious attention was paid to the question of systematic planning for the Soviet economy. In March 1920 the Council of Workers' and Peasants' Defense was given a new name — the Council of Labor and Defense (STO) — and a broader planning mission.&lt;ref&gt;Alec &gt;Nove, ''An Economic History of the USSR.'' New Edition. London: Penguin Books, 1989; pg. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

STO was established as a commission of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Sovnarkom), to be headed by the leading People's Commissars themselves, a representative of the Russian trade unions, and the chief of the Central Statistical Agency.&lt;ref name=Carr2-375&gt;E.H. Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia: The Bolshevik Revolution, 1917-1923: Volume 2.'' London: Macmillan, 1952; pg. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; STO was directed to establish a single economic plan for Soviet Russia and to direct the work of the individual People's Commissariats toward this plan's fulfillment, so that "for the first time the RSFSR had a general planning organ with clearly defined functions," as historian [[E. H. Carr]] has observed.&lt;ref name=Carr2-375 /&gt;

The State Committee for Planning, commonly known as "Gosplan," was launched as a permanent advisory subcommittee of STO, assigned with the task of conducting detailed economic investigations and providing expert recommendations to the decision-making STO.&lt;ref name=Dobb241&gt;Maurice Dobb, ''Russian Economic Development Since the Revolution.'' New York: E.P. Dutton, 1928; pg. 241; fn. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment===

[[File:The Soviet Union 1972 CPA 4087 stamp (Gleb Krzhizhanovsky (1872-1959), Scientist and Co-worker with Lenin (Birth Centenary)).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gleb Krzhizhanovsky, first head of Gosplan, as he appeared on a 1972 Soviet postage stamp.]]

Gosplan was formally established by a Sovnarkom decree, dated 22 February 1921.&lt;ref name=Carr2-376&gt;Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia,'' vol. 2, pg. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, the decree was passed on the same day that an article by Soviet leader [[V. I. Lenin]] was published in ''[[Pravda]]'' criticizing advocates of a "single economic plan" for their "idle talk" and "boring pedantry" and arguing that the [[GOELRO plan]] for national electrification was the "one serious work on the question of the single economic plan."&lt;ref name=Carr2-376 /&gt; Other members of Sovnarkom were more optimistic, however, and Lenin sustained a defeat on the establishment of another planning entity, Gosplan.&lt;ref name=Carr2-376 /&gt; As a compromise measure uniting the mission of the two planning entities, head of [[State Commission for the Electrification of Russia|GOELRO]] [[Gleb Krzhizhanovsky]] was tapped to head Gosplan.&lt;ref name=Carr2-376 /&gt;

Initially Gosplan had an advisory function,&lt;ref name=Dobb241 /&gt; with its entire staff consisting of just 34 people at the time of its April 1921 launch.&lt;ref name=Carr2-377&gt;Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia,'' vol. 2, pg. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; These were selected on the basis of academic expertise in specialized aspects of industry; just 7 were members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks)]].&lt;ref name=Carr2-377 /&gt; With the ongoing turn to a market-based system of production as part of the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), very real constraints existed on the possible extent of central planning during the initial phase of Gosplan's institutional life.

Gosplan quickly became a leading bureaucratic advocate for central planning and expanded investment in heavy industry, with Leon Trotsky one of the leading political patrons of the agency.&lt;ref name=Carr2-379&gt;Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia,'' vol. 2, pg. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1922 a new decree further expanded Gosplan's purview, with the agency directed to compose both "long-term" and "immediate" plans of production.&lt;ref name=Carr2-379 /&gt; Gosplan was to be consulted regarding proposed economic and financial decrees submitted to the Council of People's Commissars by the various economic People's Commissariats.&lt;ref name=Carr2-379 /&gt; An administrative rivalry ensued between Gosplan and the [[People's Commissariat of Finance]] (Narkomfin), the latter the agency most in favor of currency stabilization and expansion of the general economy through the regulated market.&lt;ref name=Carr2-379 /&gt;

Gosplan had no power of compulsion in this early interval, but was forced to work through Sovnarkom, STO, or the People's Commissariats to have its suggestions implemented by decree.&lt;ref name="Carr, pg. 381"&gt;Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia,'' vol. 2, pg. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; The agency's economic calculations and policy suggestions remained largely abstract throughout the first half of the 1920s, with Gosplan's desires and actual policy largely disjointed.&lt;ref name="Carr, pg. 381"/&gt;

===Emergence===

Tension continued between Narkomfin and Gosplan throughout the NEP period, with Narkomfin advocating for increased grain exports as a means of bolstering the currency by balancing imports and exports while simultaneously bolstering [[peasant]] prosperity, while Gosplan emerged as the chief advocate of cheap food and planned development of industry.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''The Interregnum,'' pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1925 Gosplan started creating annual economic plans, known as "control numbers" ({{lang|ru|контрольные цифры}}).

Its work was coordinated with the [[USSR Central Statistical Directorate]], the People's Commissariat of Finance, and the [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy]] (Vesenkha), and later with the [[Gosbank|State Bank (Gosbank)]] and [[Gossnab|State Supply Committee (Gossnab)]].

===Five-year plan===

With the introduction of [[Five-Year Plan (USSR)|five-year plan]]s in 1928, Gosplan became responsible for their creation and supervision according to the objectives declared by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|All-Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks)]].

During 1930 the Statistical Directorate was merged into Gosplan, and on 3 February 1931 Gosplan was resubordinated to the [[Sovnarkom]].

During May 1955 Gosplan was divided into two commissions: the USSR Council of Ministers State Commission for Advanced Planning and the USSR Council of Ministers Economic Commission on Current Planning. These were, respectively, tasked with predictive and immediate planning. The work of the latter was based on the five-year plans delivered by Gosplan, with Gosplan planning 10–15 years ahead.

Gosplan was headquartered at the building now occupied by the State Duma, in [[Moscow]].

==Method of material balances==
{{Soviet-type economics |}}

The introduction of the first five-year plan in 1928 led to a re-examination of the roles of Gosplan and VSNKh, the supreme state organization for management of the economy at this time. This re-examination of roles was required because [[VSNKh]] itself also had responsibility for planning through the Industrial Planning Commission (Promplan). Re-examination of roles was also required as the introduction of the first five-year plan meant that Gosplan's role was no longer one of prognosis and drafting of 'control figures' since plans had now become orders to act.

In order to ensure the success of the plan it was necessary to ensure that inputs from one part of the economy matched outputs from another part of the economy. Gosplan achieved this using a methodology called the system of '[[material balances]]'. For a plan period (in detail for one year and in lesser detail for a five-year plan) Gosplan drew up a balance sheet in terms of units of material (i.e. money was not used as part of the accounting process).

The first step in the process was to assess how much steel, cement, wool cloth, etc. would be available for the next year. This calculation was based on the following formula: production minus exports plus imports plus or minus changes in stocks. 
{{Quotation| The planning system as such was fairly simple. Gosplan calculated the sum of the country's resources and facilities, established priorities for their use, and handed down output targets and supply allocations to the various economic ministries and through them to every branch and enterprise in the entire economy. To be sure, the system had its limitations, including the absence of meaningful price and cost information and the difficulty of extending planning to all the special commodities and enterprises in a modern economy. More serious difficulties stemmed from the attitudes and priorities built into the Stalinist planning system. "From the start," write the Soviet economists Nikolai Shmelev and Vladimir Popov, "the administrative system was distinguished by economic romanticism, profound economic illiteracy, and incredible exaggeration of the real effect that the 'administrative factor' had on economic processes and on the motivations of the public." |R.V.Daniels &lt;ref name="daniels"/&gt;}}

The second step was to identify where there were mismatches between levels of outputs of one material that was used as an input in another part of the economy i.e. where there were differences between supply and demand within the economy. If mismatches between supply and demand were identified then, for the one-year plan, utilization plans for a particular input material could be cut or alternatively effort was made to increase supply. For the five-year plan mismatches between supply and demand could be mitigated by modifying long terms plans to increase productive capacity.

{{Quotation | Wages and pensions were leveled upwards, and skilled and manual work began to exceed much mental and professional work in remuneration. The Italian economic historian Rita Di Leo found "a compression of differentials" and a bias for so-called "productive" work (i.e., yielding measurable physical output) over "unproductive" work (services, trade, etc.). "Such a wage policy calls into question the modernization of society, its efficiency, its competitiveness." | R.V.Daniels &lt;ref name="daniels"/&gt;}}

Using this method any changes in the plan to remove mismatches between inputs and outputs would result in hundreds, even thousands, of changes to material balances. This meant that, without the aid of information technology, Gosplan could only deal with the economy in very general terms.

Ideological bias resulted in unrealistic plans that were impossible to execute. Pressure to execute them anyway resulted in widespread falsification of statistics on all levels of reporting. Falsified plan realization feedback further resulted in Gosplan preparing plans even more detached from reality:

{{Quotation | The second economy engulfed a significant fraction of the GDP. Not only individuals but state enterprises as well engaged in these practices, often out of necessity, when extra-legal influence or illegal operations appeared to be the only way to fulfill the demands of the plan. Claims of plan fulfillment that were passed up the hierarchy became as impossible to believe as the targets in the next plan. | R.V.Daniels &lt;ref name="daniels"&gt;Robert V. Daniels, ''The End of Communist Revolution.'' 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Indecent Exposure''''' is a satirical novel by British writer [[Tom Sharpe]], originally published in 1973. The sequel to ''[[Riotous Assembly]]'', the author’s [[debut novel]], this story also successfully lampoons the South African police under apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58514.Indecent_Exposure&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

Set in the fictional South African town of Piemburg, where local police, headed by Kommandant van Heerden, Luitenant Verkramp and Konstabel Els, are determined to maintain the government policy of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.groveatlantic.com/?title=Indecent+Exposure&lt;/ref&gt; While the Kommandant is absent at the country home of a snobbish upper class English couple, Luitenant Verkramp enlists the help of a female psychiatrist to provide the police garrison with aversion therapy, with the aim of stopping them from fraternising with black girls.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-87113-142-3&lt;/ref&gt; However, this goes horribly awry and turns the town’s entire police force into homosexuals. Called back from his holiday, Kommandant van Heerden attempts to restore some order.

The '''International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties (IMCWP)''' is an annual conference attended by [[communist party|communist]] and workers' [[political party|parties]] from several nations.  It originated in 1998 when the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE) invited communist and workers' parties to participate in an annual conference where parties could gather to share their experiences and issue a joint declaration.

The meetings are held annually, with participants from all around the globe. Additionally there are occasionally extraordinary meetings such as the meeting in [[Damascus]] 28–30 September 2009 on "Solidarity with the heroic struggle of the Palestinian people and the other people in Middle East". In December 2009, the communist and workers parties agreed to the creation of the ''International Communist Review'', which is published annually in English and Spanish and has a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iccr.gr/ | title=International Communist Review | accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Working Group ==
The participants of the meeting have created a working group to address all aspects of organizing the meetings. As of May 2018, the working group is composed by communist and worker's parties of  [[Brazilian Communist Party|Brazil]], [[Communist Party of China|China]], [[Communist Party of Cuba|Cuba]], [[Progressive Party of Working People|Cyprus]], [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Czech Republic]], [[Communist Party of Greece|Greece]], [[Hungarian Workers' Party|Hungary]],  India ([[Communist Party of India|CPI]] and [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|CPI(Marxist)]]), [[Tudeh Party of Iran|Iran]], [[Socialist Resistance of Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]], [[Workers' Party of Korea|Korea]] (DPRK), [[Lebanese Communist Party|Lebanon]], [[Mexican Communist Party|Mexico]], [[Communist Party of Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Palestinian People's Party|Palestine]], [[Portuguese Communist Party|Portugal]], Russian Federation ([[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|CP of the Russian Federation]] and [[Russian Communist Workers' Party of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Communist Worker's Party]]), [[Syrian Communist Party (Unified)|Syria]], [[South African Communist Party|South Africa]], Spain ([[Communist Party of Spain|CP of Spain]] and [[Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain|CP of the Peoples of Spain]]), Turkey, [[Communist Party of Venezuela|Venezuela]], [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Vietnam]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.solidnet.org/article/CP-of-Greece-In-Athens-on-23-25-November-2018-the-20th-International-Meeting-of-Communist-and-Workers-Parties-hosted-by-the-KKE/|title=Solidnet {{!}} CP of Greece, In Athens on 23–25 November 2018 the 20th International Meeting of Communist and Worker’s Parties, hosted by the KKE|website=www.solidnet.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The working group is in charge of defining the agenda for each meeting, as well as general organization.

The party was founded 2002 by [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]  [[Member of Parliament]] [[Salkhan Murmu]]. The party works for the rights of the [[Adivasi]] peoples. For example the party works for more quotas and reservations for Adivasis.

In 2003, JDP launched the ''Jharkhand Front'' together with four other parties, namely [[Jharkhand People's Party]], [[Jharkhand Party (Naren)]], [[Jharkhand Party (Horo)]] and [[Jharkhand Vikas Dal]]. 

In the [[Lok Sabha]] elections in 2004, the JDP launched four candidates from [[West Bengal]], two from [[Bihar (India)|Bihar]] and one from [[Jharkhand]].

The '''''Journal for the Study of Antisemitism''''' is a biannual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] which covers anthropological, sociological, psychological, legal, historical, philosophical, and political aspects of contemporary [[antisemitism]].

== History and format ==
The journal was established in 2009. Its founding editors were [[Steven K. Baum]] and [[Neal E. Rosenberg]]. An issue of the journal typically features five or six major articles, several essays and reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/24888/Locally_Produced_Journal_Addresses/ Locally Produced Journal Addresses Anti-Semitism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712212530/http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/24888/Locally_Produced_Journal_Addresses |date=2012-07-12 }}, ''[[Jewish Exponent]]'', December 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvoicesnj.org/news/2010-05-05/PDF/Page_003.pdf Attorney has made the study of antisemitism his passion], ''Jewish Community Voice'', May 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
The inaugural issue of the journal edited by Michael Berenbaum was mired in politics when an article critical of the Berlin Centre for Antisemitism Research led to the temporary dismissal of [[editorial board]] member Clemens Heni. Several other board members resigned, but returned when Heni was reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=170355 German center dismisses pro-Israel scholar], ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', March 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''King Mob''' was an [[England|English]] radical group based in [[London]] during the late 1960s/early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/mob-who-shouldnt-really-be-here&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a cultural mutation of the [[Situationist International|Situationists]] and the anarchist group [[UAW/MF]]. It sought to emphasise the cultural anarchy and disorder being ignored in [[UK|Britain]], with the ultimate aim of promoting [[proletarian]] revolution. It derived its name from [[Christopher Hibbert]]'s 1958 book on the [[Gordon Riots]] of June 1780, in which rioters daubed the [[slogan]] "His Majesty King Mob" on the walls of [[Newgate Prison]], after gutting the building.

==Actions==
King Mob appreciated pop culture and distributed its ideas and [[politics|political]] ideas through various posters and through its publication ''King Mob Echo'', which provoked reaction by celebrating killers like [[Jack the Ripper]], [[Mary Bell]] and [[John Christie (murderer)|John Christie]]. One flyer in particular celebrated [[Valerie Solanas]]' 1968 shooting of [[Andy Warhol]] and included a hit-list of [[Yoko Ono]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Mario Amaya]] (who was also shot by Solanas), [[David Hockney]], [[Mary Quant]], [[Twiggy]], [[Marianne Faithfull]] and the ''[[International Times|IT]]'' editor [[Barry Miles]].

The King Mob group allegedly planned a series of audacious actions, including blowing up a waterfall in the [[Lake District]], painting the poet [[Wordsworth]]'s house with the words "[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] Lives", and hanging peacocks in [[Holland Park]],  London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Sam|date=2013-03-01|title=The Peculiar Romanticism of the English Situationists|url=http://camqtly.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/1/20|journal=The Cambridge Quarterly|language=en|volume=42|issue=1|pages=20–37|doi=10.1093/camqtly/bft010|issn=0008-199X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of the aforementioned plans were executed. An action that was carried out, inspired by the New York-based [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]]'s "mill-in at [[Macy's]]", involved King Mob appearing at the [[Selfridges]] store in London, with one member, dressed as [[Father Christmas]], attempting to distribute all of the store's toys to children. Police subsequently forced the children to return the toys. This action involved [[Malcolm McLaren]] who reputedly applied the group's situationist ideas in the promotion of the [[Sex Pistols]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ass/punk.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

King Mob was also responsible for attacks on art galleries and for organising a battle between local [[skinhead]]s (whom they considered to be "the working class avant-garde") and [[Greaser (subculture)|greasers]] in central London.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Graffiti==
Graffiti attributed to King Mob was observed in many places particularly in the [[Notting Hill]] area, including, "''I don't believe in nothing - I feel like they ought to burn down the world - just let it burn down baby.''"

The most celebrated graffiti attributed to King Mob was the slogan which was painted along a half-mile section of the wall beside the tube (railway) commuter route into London between [[Ladbroke Grove tube station|Ladbroke Grove]] and [[Westbourne Park tube station]]s in west London:

:"''Same thing day after day- tube - work - dinner - work - tube - armchair - TV - sleep - tube - work - how much more can you take? - one in ten go mad, one in five cracks up.''"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.revoltagainstplenty.com/index.php/archive-local/128-a-hidden-history-of-king-mob-posterscartoons.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in popular culture==
The "Mask of King Mob" can be seen in the background of the comic book ''[[Watchmen]]'', written by [[Alan Moore]]. It is in what appears to be a trophy room of the Minutemen, noticeable during the infamous scene where The Comedian tries to rape the original Silk Specter.

A protagonist in the comic book series ''[[The Invisibles]]'' (authored by [[Grant Morrison]]) is codenamed "[[King Mob (comics)|King Mob]]". The Invisibles is organized anti-hierarchically, and is dedicated to defeating a global conspiracy which deceives and preys upon the world's population. The character "King Mob" describes himself as an anarchist.

Graffiti referencing King Mob appears in season 2 episode 7 of Stranger Things.

She brought a case against her attacker to be condemned, first in the [[Federal courts of Brazil|Federal Court of Brazil]] and later in the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]].

On August 7, 2006, the president of Brazil [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] put the Federal Brazilian Law 11340 into practice. Now known as the [[Lei Maria da Penha|Law Maria da Penha]], it increased the severity of punishment for [[domestic violence]] against women, whenever it occurred in a domestic or family environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2004-2006/2006/lei/l11340.htm|title = LEI Nº 11.340, DE 7 DE AGOSTO DE 2006.|date = 7 August 2006|accessdate = 7 August 2014|website = Presidência da República-Casa Civil-Subchefia para Assuntos Jurídicos|publisher = Brazilian Federal Government|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1983, her husband, Colombian schoolteacher [[Marco Antonio Heredia Viveros]],  attempted to kill her twice. The first time he  shot her in her sleep, but she survived, the second time he tried to electrocute her while she showered. Penha was left paraplegic due to these attacks.&lt;ref name=un/&gt; In the following year Maria da Penha began a legal process against Viveros. Seven years later, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The defense appealed the sentence and the conviction was overturned. A new trial was held in 1996 and a sentence of 10 years was applied. In 2001, Viveros was sentenced to eight years in prison. Through legal resources, he was jailed for two years. Viveiros was released in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lei Maria da Penha completa 6 anos|url=http://www.folhadecampinas.com.br/portal/2012/08/lei-maria-da-penha-completa-6-anos/|accessdate=7 August 2014|work=Folha de Campinas|date=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the episode came to the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) and for the first time in history it was considered a crime of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RELEVANT CASES:Maria da Penha/Brazil|url=http://cejil.org/en/cases/maria-da-penha|website=Center for Justice and International Law|accessdate=7 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808055250/http://cejil.org/en/cases/maria-da-penha|archivedate=8 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission published a report blaming the Brazilian government for negligence and omission regarding domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RELATÓRIO N° 54/01* CASO 12.051|url=https://www.cidh.oas.org/annualrep/2000port/12051.htm|website=International Commission of Human Rights|publisher=Organization of American States|date=4 April 2001|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 7, 2001 the Brazilian government sanctioned the law against domestic violence toward women, entering into force on September 22 of that year.

Today, Penha is coordinator of studies of the [[Associação de Parentes e Amigos de Vítimas de Violência (APAVV)]], in the Brazilian state of Ceará. She attended the ceremony of the sanction of Brazilian law that bears her name, together with other ministers and representatives of the Brazilian feminist movement.

Rev. '''Michael Bray''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Lutheran]] minister who was convicted in 1985 of two counts of conspiracy and one count of possessing unregistered explosive devices in relation to ten bombings of women's health clinics and offices of liberal advocacy groups in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;''News in Brief'' [[The Times]] 23 May 1985&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered "the intellectual father of the extreme radical fringe of the [[pro-life|antiabortion]] movement which engages in terrorism."&lt;ref name=stern&gt;{{cite book|last=Stern|first=Jessica|title=Terror in the name of God: why religious militants kill|year=2003|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|location=New York|isbn=0-06-050533-8|pages=148|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13iAVXvu6jQC&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;dq=michael%20bray%20terrorist&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|authorlink=Jessica Stern|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Initially sentenced to ten years in prison, he agreed to a [[plea bargain]] and served 46 months from 1985 to 1989.

A '''military budget''' (or '''military expenditure'''), also known as a '''defense [[budget]]''', is the amount of [[finances|financial resources]] dedicated by a [[Sovereign state|state]] to raising and maintaining an [[armed forces]] or other methods essential for defense purposes.

Military budgets often reflect how strongly a country perceives the likelihood of threats against it, or the amount of aggression it wishes to conjure. It also gives an idea of how much financing should be provided for the upcoming fiscal year. The size of a budget also reflects the country's ability to fund military activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/203090/defense-expenditures-of-the-us-per-capita/ Statistics on Defense Expenditures in the U.S. per Capita, 1990-2011], NATO, April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Factors include the size of that country's economy, other financial demands on that entity, and the willingness of that entity's government or people to fund such military activity. Generally excluded from military expenditures is spending on [[Law enforcement|internal law enforcement]] and disabled veteran rehabilitation. The effects of military expenditure on a nation's economy and society, and what determines military expenditure, are notable issues in [[political science]] and [[economics]]. There are controversial findings and theories regarding these topics. Generally, some suggest military expenditure is a boost to local economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hicks|first=Louis|author2=Curt Raney|title=The Social Impact of Military Growth in St. Mary's County, Maryland, 1940-1995|journal=[[Armed Forces &amp; Society]]|year=2003|volume=29|issue=3|pages=353–371|doi=10.1177/0095327x0302900303|url=http://afs.sagepub.com/content/29/3/353.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, others maintain military expenditure is a drag on development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nef|first=J.U.|title=War and Human Progress|year=1950|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year in April is the [[Global Day of Action on Military Spending]] (GDAMS), which aims to gather people and create a global movement that persuades governments to reallocate their military spending to essential human needs such as food, education, health care, social services and environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdams.org|title=Global Campaign on Military Spending - Cut Military Spending - Fund Human Needs|website=Global Campaign on Military Spending|access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the countries maintaining some of the world's largest military budgets, [[China]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] are frequently recognized to be [[great power]]s.&lt;ref name="Joshua Baron"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baron|first1=Joshua|title=Great Power Peace and American Primacy: The Origins and Future of a New International Order|date=22 January 2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=United States|isbn=1137299487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]], in 2014, total world military expenditure amounted to 1.8 trillion [[United States dollar|US$]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US military spending falls, increases in eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia|url=http://www.sipri.org/media/pressreleases/2015/milex-april-2015|website=www.sipri.org|publisher=SIPRI|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic expenditure==
{{Main|List of countries by past military expenditure}}
The ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'' magazine in February 1898 outlined the levels of military expenditure as a percentage of ''tax revenue'' spent by the then [[great powers]] for the year 1897:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frank Harris (editor)|title=[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]] Magazine|date=February 1898}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[United States]]: 17%. The United States has fluctuated for decades, depending on the  conflict of the time. The first spike in defense spending, and in turn taxes, came during the very beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Borch, Casey, and Michael Wallace. “Military Spending and Economic Well-Being in the            American States: The Post-Vietnam War Era.” Social Forces, vol. 88, no. 4, 2010, pp. 1727–1752. Oxford University Press, doi: 10.1353/sof.0.0268. Accessed 15 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; During World War I, the United States spent 22% of Gross Domestic Product, while during peacetime, the government spent on as little as 1% Gross Domestic Product (GDP).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Chantrill, Christopher. “What Is the Total US Defense Spending?” US Government Defense Spending History with Charts - a Www.usgovernmentspending.com Briefing, American Thinkers, 17 July 2011, www.usgovernmentspending.com/defense_spending&lt;/ref&gt; This changed following World War II as the United States and its citizens were experiencing an immense fear of the expansion of Communism and therefore heightened security on all fronts. This was supported by Americans as it brought upon them a sense of security and the 3.6% GDP they were contributing to was a large decrease from the whopping amounts of capital being spent during WWII that exceeded 41%, before decreasing to 10% during the Cold War and for about two more decades after, including the Vietnam War, before beginning to decrease in the 1970s down to 6%, then 5.5% in 1979 before beginning to steadily incline once again.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After 2001, though, and the September 11 terrorist attacks, defense spending spiked again, peaking at 5.7% in 2010.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* [[Russian Empire]]: 21%
* [[French Third Republic]]: 27%
* [[British Empire]]: 39%
* [[German Empire]]: 43%
* [[Empire of Japan]]: 55%

==Projected expenditure==

'''NKVD troika''' or '''Special troika''' ({{lang-ru|особая тройка}}), in [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet history]], were the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs ([[NKVD]] which would later be the beginning of the [[KGB]]) of three persons who issued [[sentence (law)|sentence]]s to people after simplified, speedy investigations and without a public and fair [[trial]].&lt;ref name="nkvd00487" /&gt; The three members were judge and jury, though they themselves did not carry out the sentences they dealt. These commissions were employed as instruments of [[extrajudicial punishment]] introduced to supplement the Soviet legal system with a means for quick and secret execution or imprisonment.&lt;ref name="applebaum" /&gt; It began as an institution of the [[Cheka]], then later became prominent again in the NKVD, when it was used during the [[Great Purge]] to execute many hundreds of thousands of Soviet citizens.&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt; Defendants in the Troika’s proceeding were typically not entitled to legal aid or the presumption of innocence.  Convictions usually did not include information about actual incriminating evidence and basically contained only information about indictment and sentencing. The outcome of such trials was often determined before it even began due to targeted numbers of citizens to be executed or imprisoned in [[gulag]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stalin and Stalinism, Revised third edition|last=McCauley|first=Martin|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Troika'' means "a group of three" or "triad" in Russian.

== Background ==
[[File:Приговор тройки УНКВД.jpg|thumb|Sentence by the [[Tver Oblast|Kalinin Oblast]] NKVD troika condemning priest Peter Zinoviev to [[execution by shooting]].]]

The first troika was instituted in 1918, the members being [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], [[Yakov Peters]], and [[Left Eser|Left SR]] [[V. Aleksandrovich]].

The first "operational troikas" (оперативная тройка) were introduced in the "centre", in the Moscow military [[okrug]] in 1929.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The qualifier "operational" denotes they were based on the ''operational departments'' of the state police ([[OGPU]]).  The troikas were tasked with administering quick punishment of anti-Soviet elements, without public trial or investigation. The sentences that were doled out, executions, were to be held in secret.

In January 1930, as part of the [[collectivization]] program, the Soviet [[Politburo]] authorized the state police to screen the [[peasant]] population of the entire Soviet Union. Normal legal procedures were suspended and the corresponding OGPU order of the 2nd of February, specified the measures needed for "the liquidation of the [[kulaks]] as a class". This instituted a regional based system for these troikas to work, so that the operations could be handed locally and with a quicker result.  In each region, the troikas would decide the fate of the peasants branded as "kulaks". The troika, composed of a member of the [[OGPU|state police]], a local [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|communist party]] secretary, and a [[public procurator|state procurator]], had the authority to issue rapid and severe verdicts (death or exile) without the right to [[appeal]]. In effect they served as [[judge]]s, [[juries]], and [[executioner]]s.&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt;

The secret police troikas became an execution machine, implementing persecutions and torture of priests or other "anti-Soviet elements."  This was done in secret and the victims of these trials often stood no chance at fighting the claims placed before them.  They were often forced to give evidence against themselves and watch as the members of the troika sentenced them, often times to death.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Gradually, troikas were introduced to other parts of the Soviet Union for various and different purposes: "court troikas" (судебная тройка), "extraordinary troikas" (чрезвычайная тройка), and "special troikas" (специальная тройка).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}
At the beginning of the [[Great Patriotic War]] the NKVD was tasked with deporting thousands of Germans from the [[Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]].  This decree issued from Moscow in 1941 was the responsibility of the Troika and all measures of decrees execution were left in the hands of the so-called three who made up this particular Troika.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{McCauley, Martin. Stalin and Stalinism. Pearson Education Limited, 2008.
Revised 3rd Edition. P. 68}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war responsibilities within the government began to shift and in 1952 two special Troikas were crested.  The first Troika consisted of [[Georgy Malenkov]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]] (who was also heavily involved with the [[Great Purge]] and [[Show trial]]), and [[Nikolai Bulganin]].  The second consisted of [[Lavrentiy Beria]], [[Mikhail Pervukhin]], and [[Maksim Saburov]].  These troikas were created to make sure there were clear duties between party and state, although it was common to be involved on both party and state committees this blurred the lines between party and state functions.&lt;ref&gt;Zubkova, Elena.

== Secret Order № 00447 — the "Kulak Operations" ==
{{Main|NKVD Order No. 00447}} On June 28, 1937, the Politburo issued a decree to set up a troika in West Siberia. While the original intent was to discover if there was a plot stemming from the ROVS, a group of white officers based in Paris, this can be seen as the first step in the creation of order NKVD Order no. 00447.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellman|first=Michael|date=2010|title=Regional influences on the Formulation and Implementation of NKVD Order 00447|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09668136.2010.489254|journal=Europe-Asia Studies|volume=62:6|pages=915–931|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Kucherenko shoot.jpeg|thumb|right|[[NKVD]] document issued sentencing blind "Ukrainian pensioner [[bandurist]]" [[Ivan Kuchuhura Kucherenko|Ivan Kucherenko]] to [[execution by shooting]]. The title of the signatory (in {{lang-ru|Секретарь Тройки}} — "Secretary of the Troika") can be seen.]]

The [[NKVD Order no. 00447]] by July 30, 1937 ''О репрессировании бывших кулаков, уголовников и других антисоветских элементов'' ("Concerning the repression of former [[kulak]]s, criminals, and other [[Anti-Soviet agitation|anti-Soviet element]]s") undersigned by [[Nikolai Yezhov]]. By this order, troikas were created on the levels of republic, [[krai]] and [[oblast]].&lt;ref name="alexanderyakovlev1" /&gt; Investigation was to be performed by 'operative groups' "in a speedy and simplified way" and the results were to be delivered to troikas for trials.&lt;ref name="nkvd00487" /&gt;  The regional troikas had the power and of choice of the target groups, the size of the initial limits, the extension of the deadline for completing the operation, the relationship between the initial limits and the final number of victims"&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Initially, the target groups were limited to only Kulaks and criminals.  After some time it broaden to enemies of the Motherland.

The chairman of a troika was the chief of the corresponding territorial subdivision of NKVD ([[People's Commissar]] of a republican NKVD, etc.).&lt;ref name="alexanderyakovlev1" /&gt; Usually a troika included the prosecutor of the republic/krai/oblast in question; if not, he was allowed to be present at the session of a troika. The third person was usually the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) secretary of the corresponding regional level.&lt;ref name="applebaum" /&gt; The staff of these troikas were personally specified in the Order № 00447.&lt;ref name="nkvd00487" /&gt; While Order 00447 decreed the personal constitution of all ''troikas'', in the course of the Purge many members of ''troikas'' were repressed themselves, so the staff of ''troikas'' varied over time.&lt;ref name="alexanderyakovlev2" /&gt;

Protocols of a troika session were passed to the corresponding operative group for executions of sentences. Times and places of executions of death sentences were ordered to be held in secret.&lt;ref name="nkvd00487" /&gt; Troikas of this purpose were established for a period of 4 months,&lt;ref name="nkvd00487" /&gt; but functioned for about a year. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

When Operation № 00447 was finally stopped, on November 17, 1938, by the [[Decree about Arrests, Prosecutor Supervision and Course of Investigation]], issued jointly by the [[Sovnarkom]] and [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the CPSU]], it is estimated that up to 767,000 persons had been condemned, of whom 387,000 had been [[Execution by shooting|executed by shooting]].&lt;ref name="Werth1" /&gt;

== The "National Operations" ==
{{Main|Mass operations of the NKVD}}

On August 11, 1937, following a Politburo top-secret resolution taken two days earlier, Nikolai Ezhov issued another secret directive, Order № 00485, aimed at "the complete liquidation of local branches of the Polish Military Organization (POW) and its networks of spies, wreckers and terrorists in industry, transport and agriculture".&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Werth2" /&gt;

Due to a backlog of people being processed by "dvoikas" (two person extrajudicial commissions) as part of the Polish Operations, on September 15, 1938 the [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo]] issued the resolution (# П64/22) about the creation of special troikas (Особая тройка) for the period of the [[Polish operation of the NKVD]].&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt;

Order № 00485 served as a model for a series of similar [[Mass operations of the NKVD|NKVD "National Operations"]] targeting a number of the Soviet Union's diaspora nationalities and ethnic groups: the German, Finnish, Latvian, Estonian, Romanian, Greek, and Chinese. The NKVD referred to these decrees collectively as "the National Operations" directed against "nationalities of foreign governments".&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Werth2" /&gt;

According to NKVD statistics, from July 1937 to November 1938, 335,513 persons were sentenced by troikas in the course of the implementation of the National Operations. Among them, 247,157 (or 73.6%) were executed by shooting.&lt;ref name="Werth2" /&gt;

== The American Jewish Joint Agricultural Cooperation and Birobidzhan (JAR) ==
The American Jewish Joint Agricultural Cooperation, 1924-1938 (Agro-Joint) worked to permanently resettle Jews from Shtelts (small Jewish settlements) into new agriculture based settlements across Southern Ukraine and Crimea.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Farming the red land Jewish agricultural colonization and local Soviet power, 1924-1941|last=Dekel-Chen|first=Jonathan L.|publisher=New Haven: Yale University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agro-Joint had aided in the resettlement of German-Jewish doctors to help grow the living standards of the communities. Germans were among the top nationalities being repressed and eliminated in Soviet Russia during the thirties while Stalin prepared for war with Hitler. During the [[Great Purge]], 1937–38, there was a directive to rid the Soviet lands of all those with outside (non-Soviet) ties or connections. Members of the Agro-Joint, as well as foreign colonies and national diasporas such as the settlements they established, fell squarely within those parameters.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitsel|first=Mikhael|date=2009|title=The Final Chapter: Agro-Joint workers - victims of the Great Terror in the USSR, 1937-40|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/13501670902750303|journal=East European Jewish Affairs|volume=39:1|pages=79–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Agro-Joint was never intended as a permanent program the swiftness and fierceness with which it was dismantled by the Soviet Regime shocked those involved, in particular, its leader Joseph Rosen whose network of internal Soviet connections fell to the purges.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In total around 60 high ranking members of the Agro-Joint staff were arrested, the bulk of which were tried and sentenced by NKVD Troikas on the grounds of being counter-revolutionaries, nationalists, or spies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Happening in conjunction with the resettlements by the Agro-Joint was the Soviet Union's attempt at giving the Jewish population a homeland. This was the Jewish Autonomous Region commonly referred to by its central city [[Birobidzhan Oblast|Birobidzhan]] established in 1928,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dreams of Nationhood: American Jewish Communists and the Soviet Birobidzhan Project, 1924-1951|last=Srebrnik|first=Henry Felix|publisher=Academic Studies Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though not officially recognized as an Autonomous Region by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of USSR until May 1934.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Where the Jews Aren't: The Sad and Absurd Tale of Birobidzhan, Russia's Jewish Autonomous Region.|last=Gessen|first=Masha|publisher=Schocken Books|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though conditions were tough and approximately 2/3rds of the original settlers left upon seeing that things were not as promised, those that remained founded Birofeld, the first Jewish collective farm in 1928.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In 1936, barely a year after the official recognition as an Autonomous Region, The Great Terror began and the Jewish Party leadership both in Moscow and Birobidzhan was decimated by arrests and fast trials (by troika), resulting either imprisonment or execution on charges such as "bourgeois nationalism" or being spies for the Germans. Prominent Jewish writer Moyshe Litvakov confessed to being an agent for the gestapo.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== The Katyn Massacre ==
The Katyn Massacre was a mass execution of around 15,000 Polish military officers carried out by the NKVD during the spring of 1940. The killings took place in the Katyn forest in Russia and other cites. After a request from Polish general, Władysław Anders, on the whereabouts of the 15,000 Polish POWs in 1941, the Soviet Union replied that the soldiers had fled and were not able to be located.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life|last=Brackman|first=Roman|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-7146-5050-0|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whereabouts of these prisoners remained unknown until 1943. Approximately 4,000 bodies of the victims were found by German soldiers at the Katyn location. Physical evidence suggested that the soldiers were shot in the back of the head and then buried in large piles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Soviet Union went on to deny these killings until 1990 when Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev acknowledged that the Soviet Union was, in fact, responsible for the deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/04/14/kremlin-admits-massacre-of-poles/246d81d9-75c5-44f3-b348-245525f2bba1/|title=Kremlin Admits Massacre of Poles|last=Remnick|first=David|date=1990|work=The Washington Post|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the documents surrounding the massacre were destroyed, and others were not made public until 2010.

According to the released documents, the executions were authorized by a troika consisting of Vsevolod Merkulov, Bogdan Kobulov, and Leonid Bashtakov.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wasilewski|first=Witold|date=2012|title=The Birth and Persistence of the Katlyn Lie|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1077&amp;context=jil|journal=Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law|volume=|pages=671–693|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, 2010, a commemoration ceremony was held marking the 70th anniversary of the massacre. Russian Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, and Polish Prime Minister took part, making it the first time the leaders of Russia and Poland held a joint ceremony honoring the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/08/world/europe/08putin.html|title=Putin Marks Soviet Massacre of Polish Officers|last=Schwirtz|first=Michael|date=April 7, 2010|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National communism''' refers to the various forms in which [[communism]] has been adopted and/or implemented by leaders in different countries. In each independent state, empire, or dependency, the relationship between class and nation had its own particularities. The Ukrainian communists Shakhrai and Mazlakh and then Muslim [[Sultan Galiyev]] considered the interests of the Bolshevik Russian state at odds with those of their countries. This was followed after 1945 by the Yugoslav communist leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] when he attempted to pursue an independent foreign policy.

Communism as [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] envisioned it was meant to be very [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] as [[proletarian internationalism]] was expected to place [[class conflict]] well ahead of [[nationalism]] as a priority for the [[working class]]. Nationalism was seen as a tool that the bourgeoisie used to [[divide and rule]] the proletariat ([[bourgeois nationalism]]). Whereas the influence of [[World communism|international communism]] was very strong from the late 19th century through the 1920s, the decades after that—beginning with [[socialism in one country]] and progressing into the [[Cold War]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]—made national communism a larger political reality.

== ''The Communist Manifesto'' (1848) ==
During the decade of the 1840s, the word "communist" came into general use to describe those who hailed the left-wing of the [[Jacobin Club]] of the [[French Revolution]] as their ideological forefathers.&lt;ref name=Fern23&gt;David Fernbach, "Introduction" to Karl Marx, ''The Revolutions of 1848.'' New York: Random House, 1973; pg. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, the [[Communist League]] was founded in [[London]]. The League asked [[Karl Marx]] and [[Frederick Engels]] to draft ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', which was adopted by the league and published in 1848. The ''Communist Manifesto'' included a number of views of the role of the nation in the implementation of the manifesto. The [[preamble]] notes that ''The Communist Manifesto'' arose from [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] from various nations coming together in London to publish their shared views, aims and tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm | title=Manifesto of the Communist Party | accessdate=August 16, 2012 | author=Marx K. &amp; Engels F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter one then discusses how the rise of the [[bourgeoisie]] has led to [[globalisation]] and the place of national issues:
:In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations.

:Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois, the East on the West. [...] Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle. The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie.

[[Maxime Rodinson]] wrote in ''Marxism and the Muslim World'' the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Marxism and the Muslim world | publisher=[[Zed Books]] | author=Rodinson, Maxime | year=1981 | isbn=0-85345-586-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Classical Marxism, for once faithful to Marx himself, postulates that a socialist state cannot be imperialist. But no proof is provided to support this thesis.

According to Roman Rozdolsky: "When the Manifesto says that the workers 'have no country', this refers to the bourgeois national state, not to nationality in the ethnical sense. The workers 'have no country' because according to Marx and Engels, they must regard the bourgeois national  state as a machinery for their oppression[19]-and after they have achieved power they will likewise have 'no country' in the political sense, inasmuch as the separate socialist national states will be only a transitional stage on the way to the classless and stateless society of the future, since the construction of such a society is possibly only on the international scale".

== Later use ==
Milovan Djilas popularized the term in his ''New Class'' (1957): “No single form of communism [...] exists in any other way than as national communism. In order to maintain itself it must become national". A few years earlier, ex communist Manabendra Roy noted: “Communism in Asia is essentially nationalism painted Red". The Dutch Social Democrat Anton Pannakoek and Russian monarchists Nicholas Ustrialov and Vasilii Shulgin pointed out in 1920 that Russians first "nationalized" communism. They thus drew attention to how far the Bolsheviks differed from all other European social democratic parties in terms of structure and ideology and to the fact  [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolshevik Party]] (formed from the left-wing of the [[Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party]]) can be considered the first national communist party. In March 1918, Lenin renamed his party the Russian Communist Party. National communism also refers to non-Russian communist currents that arose in the former tsarist empire after Lenin seized power in [[October Revolution|October 1917]] and to the various communist regimes that emerged after 1945 in other parts of the world.

In the wake of their Russian counterparts, left-wing socialists in [[Ukraine]] and the [[Muslim]] areas of the former tsarist empire also developed distinct variants of communism that continued in the Soviet Union until 1928. Ukrainian and Muslim variants differed from each other on two points in particular. The Muslims believed the fate of world revolution depended on events in Asia and not Europe. They also argued alliances with the national bourgeoisie were necessary for the duration of the liberation struggle. Class divisions had to be ignored, otherwise the national bourgeoisie would turn away from national liberation, ally with their imperial counterparts and thus ensure the ultimate collapse of any revolutionary struggle and national liberation. In its Muslim variant, it was a synthesis of nationalism, communism and anarchism as well as religion. Muslim communists included people from both left and right-wing groups which predated the [[Russian Revolution]], joining the Russian Bolshevik Party between 1917 and 1920—some of whom later were [[Narkomnats]] under the [[People's Commissar]] [[Joseph Stalin]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== In Ukraine ==
In 1918, the book ''Do Khvyli'' (translated into English as ''On The Current Situation in the Ukraine'', P. Potichnyj ed. [1970]), written by the Ukrainian communists Serhii Mazlakh and [[Vasyl' Shakhrai]], challenged what they saw as Russian domination over Ukraine under Bolshevik rule. The precursors of the Ukrainian communists, the Ukrainian left-social democrats in March 1919 tried to direct the mass anti-Bolshevik uprising that began then in Ukraine, but failed to win control over a sizable territory. Their main military force under Danylo Zeleny was defeated by July 1919. Faced with [[Anton Denikin]]'s successful offensive, they decided to stop further military activity and ally with the Bolsheviks as the lesser evil. In January 1920, they formed the [[Ukrainian Communist Party]] which recognized Russian communist rule over Soviet Ukraine, but criticized Bolshevik administrative, cultural, political, party and economic centralization. In a letter submitted to the [[Third International]] that year, they extended the analysis of Shakhrai and Mazlakh.&lt;ref&gt;"Letter from the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party to the Executive of the Comintern," ''Debatte''  no. 2 (2009) http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09651560903172282&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Muslim regions of the former Russian Empire ==
{{see also|Islamic communism}}
Open conflict between prominent Muslim theorists such as [[Mirsäyet Soltanğäliev]] and Lenin and Stalin broke out in 1919 at the [[Second Congress of the Communist International]] over the autonomy of the Muslim Communist Party as well as at the [[Congress of the Peoples of the East]] and the First Conference of the Turkic Peoples' Communists of Soviet Russia and significantly at the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|Tenth Congress of the Bolshevik Party]] (April 1921). The crisis resulted in the purge of the [[Communist Party of Turkestan]] in December 1922 and the arrest of [[Mirsäyet Soltanğäliev|Sultan Galiev]] in 1923. Galiev was the first Bolshevik Party member to be arrested by Stalin. The immediate cause of his arrest were his comments on the 12th Congress resolutions regarding concessions to non-Russians. Stalin was infuriated that Galiev rejected his juxtaposition of "great power chauvinism" with "local nationalism". Reaction to great-power chauvinism, Galiev explained, was not "nationalism" and it was simply reaction to great power chauvinism. Nine days later, he was arrested.

During this time, Soltanğäliev, [[Turar Ryskulov]], [[Nariman Narimanov]] and [[Ahmet Baytursunov]] were very influential especially through the [[Communist University of the Toilers of the East]] which opened in 1921 and was very active until its staff was purged in 1924. Communists from outside the Soviet Union such as [[Manabendra Nath Roy]], [[Henk Sneevliet]] and [[Sultan Zade]] also taught there, formulating similar political positions. Students of the university included [[Sen Katayama]], [[Tan Malaka]], [[Liu Shaoqi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh]].

The great purge in the Muslim republics began in 1928 with executions of Veli Ibrahimov of the Tatar Communist Party and [[Milli Firka]] followed by the leaders of [[Hummet]], Tatar Communist Party and even the [[Tatar Union of the Godless]]. It also happened in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and the Young Bukharians.

[[Image:Nick Xenophon.jpg|right|thumb|[[Nick Xenophon]] in September 2008.]]
'''No Pokies''' was an independent [[South Australian Legislative Council]] ticket that ran upper house candidates at the [[South Australian state election, 1997|1997]], [[South Australian state election, 2002|2002]] and [[South Australian state election, 2006|2006]] state elections. Poker machines or "pokies" are the Australian version of [[slot machines]]. It was replaced by the [[Nick Xenophon Team]] in 2013.

Independents elected from this ticket consist of: 

* [[Nick Xenophon]], barrister and anti-gambling campaigner, elected in 1997 on 2.9 percent with preferences and again in 2006 on 20.5 percent
* [[Ann Bressington]], anti-drugs campaigner, elected in 2006 as Xenophon's first of two running mates
* [[John Darley (Australian politician)|John Darley]], former valuer-general, third running mate in 2006 was appointed on 21 November 2007 to replace outgoing MP Nick Xenophon, re-elected in 2014

Xenophon's vote at the election came approximately equally from Labor and Liberal party voters.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/fearful-of-xenophon-in-senate/2007/10/11/1191696082652.html |title=Fearful of Xenophon in Senate |publisher=theage.com.au |date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal politics==
Xenophon resigned from the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] in early October 2007 to stand for the [[Australian Senate]] as an independent at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]] in which he was successful, on a primary vote of 14.78 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefs-13745-SA.htm |title=Senate State First Preferences By Candidate |publisher=Results.aec.gov.au |date=2007-12-20 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABC election analyst [[Antony Green]] had stated prior to the election that Xenophon would win a seat, while [[Centrebet]] speculated his odds would start on a favourable $1.50 for and $2.70 against. [[Nick Minchin]] "urged people not to vote for Mr Xenophon",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nance Haxton |url=http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/12/2057774.htm |title=No Pokies MP odds-on for Senate seat |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Liberal Party's 2006 upper house vote only 5.5 percent higher, and polled lower than Xenophon in some booths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/weblog/200603/s1595132.htm |title=South Australia State Election 2006.

Xenophon's federal platform consists of anti-gambling, pro-[[consumer protection]], attention to the water crisis, ratifying [[Kyoto protocol|Kyoto]], opposition against what he calls a decrease in state rights, and opposition to [[WorkChoices]].&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; Xenophon shared the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] with the [[Australian Greens|Greens]] and [[Family First Party|Family First]] during the 2008–11 Senate parliamentary session, with the Greens holding the sole balance of power since July 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5972">The '''North–South model''', developed largely by [[Columbia University]] economics professor [[Ronald Findlay]], is a model in [[Development economics|developmental economics]] that explains the growth of a less developed "[[Global South|South]]" or "periphery" economy that interacts through trade with a more developed "[[Global North|North]]" or "core" economy. The North–South model is used by dependencia theorists as a theoretical economic justification for [[dependency theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Abdenur, Adriana [http://www.tc.columbia.edu/cice/Issues/04.02/42abdenur.pdf "Tilting the North South Axis"], ''Princeton University'', 2002, accessed June 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions==
The model makes a few critical assumptions about the North and the South, as well as the relationship between the two.&lt;ref&gt;Molana, H. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2234035 "North South Growth and the Terms of Trade"], ''The Economic Journal'', 1989, accessed June 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Northern economy is operating under [[Exogenous growth model|Solow-Swan assumptions]] while the Southern economy is operating under [[Dual sector model|Lewis growth assumptions]]. However, for the purposes of simplicity of this model, the output of the traditional sector of the Lewis model is ignored, and we equate output in the modern sector of the South to total output of the South.
* The more developed North produces [[final goods|manufactured goods]] while the less developed South produces [[primary sector of the economy|primary goods]]. These are the only two goods.
* Both economies undergo complete [[division of labor|specialization]]
* There are no barriers to trade, and only two trading partners
* [[Income elasticity of demand]] equals unity in both countries, so economic growth results in a proportionate growth in demand.
* The South depends on the imported goods from the North in order to produce its own goods. This is because the heavy machinery required for production of primary products comes only from the North. The relationship is nonreciprocal, however; the North does not depend on the South, since it can use its own heavy machinery to produce manufactured goods.

==Theory==
The North–South model begins by defining the relevant equations for the economies of each country, and concludes that the growth rate of the South is locked by the growth rate of the North.&lt;ref&gt;Findlay, Ronald. ''Growth and Development in Trade Model''.Handbook of International Economics, 1984, p. 185-236.&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion relies heavily on an analysis of the [[terms of trade]] between the two countries; i.e., the price ratio between manufactures and primary products. The terms of trade, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, are defined as

&lt;math&gt;\theta = \frac{price\,of\,primary\,products}{price\,of\,manufactures} &lt;/math&gt;

To determine equilibrium, we need only to look at the market for one of the goods, as per [[Walras' law]]. We consider the market for the South's goods: primary products. The demand for imports, M, from the South is a positive function of per capita consumption in the North and a negative function of the terms of trade, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, (higher &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; means relative price of primary products is high and less will be demanded). The supply side comes from export of primary products by the South, X, and is a positive function of the terms of trade and the South’s aggregate consumption of primary products.

[[File:Terms of Trade in North-South Model.png|Screen shot 2000-06-24 at 11.23.41 AM]]

This graph makes it clear that the real terms of trade decreases when the growth rate is higher in the South than in the North (because, thanks to unity in elasticity of demand, the export line would shift to the right faster than the import line). The resultant decrease in the terms of trade, however, means a lower growth rate for the South. This creates a [[negative feedback]] cycle in which the growth rate of the South is exogenously determined by that of the North. Note that the growth rate of the north, g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, is equal to n + m, where n is population growth and m is growth of [[technological change|labor-augmenting technical progress]], as per the [[Exogenous growth model|Solow-Swan model]].

[[File:Growth in the North South Model.png|Growth in the North South Model]]

The conclusion, which fits in with dependency theory, is that the South can never grow faster than the North, and thus will never catch up.

==Relationship to import substitution theories==

Economic theories such as the North–South model have been used to justify arguments for [[import substitution industrialization|import substitution]]. Under this theory, less developed countries should use barriers to trade such as [[protective tariff]]s to shelter their industries from foreign competition and allow them to grow to the point where they will be able to compete globally.&lt;ref&gt;Whalley, John. ''The North South Debate and the Terms of Trade''. A Review of Economics and Statistics, 1984, Vol. 66 No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note, however, that the North–South model only applies to countries that are completely specialized; that is, they are not competing with foreign markets – they are the only ones producing whichever good they are producing. The way around the terms of trade trap predicted by the North–South model is to produce goods that do compete with foreign goods. For example, the [[four asian tigers|Asian Tigers]] are famous for pursuing development strategies that involved using their [[comparative advantage]] in labor to produce [[labor intensity|labor-intensive]] goods like textiles more efficiently than the United States and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, Anne. ''Trade Policy as an Input to Development''. NBER Working Paper No. 466&lt;/ref&gt;

The Provisional IRA emerged in December 1969, following a split in the republican movement. It was so-called to mirror the 1916 [[Provisional Government of the Irish Republic]], and also to designate it as temporary pending reorganisation of the movement. Although this eventually happened in 1970, the name "Provisional" stuck with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=m8_pM7Ncij8C&amp;pg=PA200&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=the+mission+was+proclaimed+accomplished+in+september+1970+ira#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20mission%20was%20proclaimed%20accomplished%20in%20september%201970%20ira&amp;f=false | title=Terror, Insurgency, and the State: Ending Protracted Conflicts| isbn=978-0812239744| last1=Heiberg| first1=Marianne| last2=O'Leary| first2=Brendan| last3=O'Leary| first3=Lauder Professor of Political Science and Director of the Solomon Asch Center for the Study of Ethnopolitical Conflict Brendan| last4=Tirman| first4=John| year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Troubles [[The Troubles#Late 1960s|had begun]] shortly before when a largely Catholic, nonviolent [[Northern Ireland civil-rights movement (1960s)|civil rights campaign]] was met with violence from both [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster loyalists]] and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC), culminating in the [[1969 Northern Ireland riots|August 1969 riots]] and [[Operation Banner|deployment of British troops]].&lt;ref name="The Provisional IRA' p. 117"&gt;''The Provisional IRA'' by Patrick Bishop and Eamonn Mallie ({{ISBN|0-552-13337-X}}), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The IRA initially focused on defence of Catholic areas, but it began [[Provisional Irish Republican Army campaign 1969–97|an offensive campaign in 1971]] (see [[List of chronologies of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions|timeline]]). The IRA's primary goal was to force the United Kingdom to negotiate a withdrawal from Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=I.R.A.

It also carried out a bombing campaign in Northern Ireland and England against what it saw as political and economic targets.

The IRA called a final ceasefire in July 1997, after its political wing [[Sinn Féin]] was re-admitted into the [[Northern Ireland peace process|Northern Ireland peace talks]]. It supported the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]] and in 2005 it disarmed under [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning|international supervision]]. An internal British Army document (released in 2007 under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]]) examining its 37 years of deployment in Northern Ireland, describes the IRA as "a professional, dedicated, highly skilled and resilient force", while loyalist paramilitaries and other republican groups are described as "little more than a collection of gangsters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6276416.stm|title=Army paper says IRA not defeated|date=6 July 2007|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; American media usually described the IRA as "activists" and "guerillas", while the British press widely dubbed them "terrorists". Several splinter groups have been formed as a result of splits within the IRA, including the [[Continuity IRA]] which emerged from a split in 1986 but did not become active until the Provisional IRA ceasefire of 1994, and the [[Real IRA]] after the final 1997 ceasefire, both of which are still active in the low-level [[dissident Irish republican campaign]].

==Overview of strategies==
The IRA's initial strategy was to use guerrilla tactics to cause the collapse of the [[government of Northern Ireland]] and to inflict enough casualties on British forces that the British government would be forced by public opinion in Britain to withdraw from the region.&lt;ref name="O'Brien The Long War, p. 119"&gt;O'Brien The Long War, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy involved recruitment of [[Volunteer (Irish republican)|volunteers]], increasing after the 1972 [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] incident in which the British armed forces killed unarmed protesters, and launching attacks against British military and economic targets.&lt;ref name="O'Brien, Long War, p. 107"&gt;O'Brien, Long War, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Prevention of Terrorism in British Law'' by Clive Walker ({{ISBN|978-0719022036}}), page 9&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was supported by arms and funding from [[Libya]]&lt;ref name="Bowyer Bell 1997 pp. 556"&gt;Bowyer Bell, J.

This saw them conduct a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] against the British and increased emphasis on political activity, via the political party [[Sinn Féin]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Troubles: A Generation of Violence 1967–1992'' by John Bowyer Bell ({{ISBN|0-7171-2201-8}}), page 555&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The preceding reference is only for the "war of attrition" part of the sentence --&gt;

The success of the [[1981 Irish hunger strike]] in mobilising support and winning elections led to the [[Armalite and ballot box strategy]], with more time and resources devoted to political activity. The abortive attempt at an escalation of the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997#Libyan arms and the "Tet Offensive"|military part of that strategy]] led republican leaders increasingly to look for a political compromise to end the conflict, with a broadening dissociation of Sinn Féin from the IRA. Following negotiations with the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) and secret talks with representatives of both the Irish and British governments, the IRA ultimately called a ceasefire in 1994 on the understanding that Sinn Féin would be included in political negotiations for a settlement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite book| last = Tonge | first = Johnathan | authorlink = Jonathan Tonge | title = Northern Ireland: Conflict and Change | publisher = [[Longman]] | year = 1996 | page = 168 | isbn = 978-0-582-42400-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the British government, dependent on [[Ulster Unionist Party]] votes at Westminster, then demanded the disarmament of the IRA before it allowed Sinn Féin into multiparty talks, the IRA called off its ceasefire in February 1996. The British demand was quickly dropped after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|May 1997 general election]] in the UK. The IRA ceasefire was then reinstated in July 1997 and Sinn Féin was admitted into all-party talks, which produced the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998.

The IRA's armed campaign, primarily in Northern Ireland but also in England and mainland Europe, caused the deaths of approximately 1,800 people. The dead included around 1,100 members of the British security forces, and about 640 civilians.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;1969–2001: 1,821 deaths, including 621 civilians.

On 28 July 2005, the [[IRA Army Council]] announced an end to [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997|its armed campaign]], stating that it would work to achieve its aims using "purely political and democratic programmes through exclusively peaceful means",&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Full text: IRA statement | url = https://www.theguardian.com/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,,1537996,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London | date = 28 July 2005 | accessdate =17 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly afterwards completed [[Decommissioning in Northern Ireland|decommissioning]].

==Organisation==
The Provisional IRA was organised hierarchically. At the top of the organisation was the IRA Army Council, headed by the [[IRA Chief of Staff]].

===Leadership===
All levels of the organisation were entitled to send delegates to IRA General Army Conventions (GACs). The GAC was the IRA's supreme decision-making authority. Before 1969, GACs met regularly. Since 1969, there have only been three, in 1970, 1986, and 2005, owing to the difficulty in organising such a large gathering of an illegal organisation in secret.&lt;ref name="structure"&gt;{{Cite book| last = O'Brien | first = Brendan | authorlink = Brendan O'Brien (Irish journalist) | title = The Long War: The IRA and Sinn Féin | publisher = O'Brien Press |year=1999 | page = 158 | isbn = 978-0-86278-606-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAC in turn elected a 12-member IRA Executive, which selected seven volunteers to form the IRA Army Council.&lt;ref name="structure"/&gt; For day-to-day purposes, authority was vested in the Army Council which, as well as directing policy and taking major tactical decisions, appointed a Chief of Staff from one of its number or, less often, from outside its ranks.&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;
The Chief of Staff would appoint an adjutant general as well as a General Headquarters (GHQ), which consisted of heads of the following departments:
* [[IRA Quartermaster General|Armoury]]
* Finance
* Engineering
* Training
* Intelligence
* Publicity
* Operations
* Security

===Regional command===
[[File:PIRAcolourpartyDublin.JPG|thumb|right|Republican colour party in Dublin, March 2009. The blue flag being carried at the front is that of "Dublin Brigade IRA".]]

The IRA was divided into a [[IRA Northern Command|Northern Command]], which operated in the nine [[Ulster]] counties as well as the [[Irish border|border]] counties of [[County Leitrim|Leitrim]] and [[County Louth|Louth]], and a Southern Command, operating in the rest of Ireland. The Provisional IRA was originally commanded by a leadership based in [[Dublin]]. However, in 1977, parallel to the introduction of cell structures at local level, command of the "war-zone" was given to the Northern Command. According to [[Ed Moloney]], these moves at re-organisation were the idea of [[Ivor Bell]], [[Gerry Adams]] and [[Brian Keenan (Irish republican)|Brian Keenan]].&lt;ref&gt;Moloney, pp. 155–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brigades===
The IRA referred to its ordinary members as volunteers (or ''óglaigh'' in Irish). Until the late 1970s, IRA volunteers were organised in units based on conventional military structures. Volunteers living in one area formed a [[Company (military unit)|company]] as part of a [[battalion]], which could be part of a [[brigade]], although many battalions were not attached to a brigade.

IRA brigades usually followed [[Counties of Ireland|county]] lines, which were sometimes subdivided (especially when they included major urban areas).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.anphoblacht.com/roll-of-honour|title=Roll of Honour – An Phoblacht|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade|Belfast Brigade]] had three battalions, in the west, north and east of the city. In the early years of [[the Troubles]], the IRA in Belfast expanded rapidly; in August 1969, the Belfast Brigade had just 50 active members – by the end of 1971, it had 1,200 members, giving it a large but loosely controlled structure.&lt;ref&gt;Moloney, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Derry Battalion became the [[Provisional IRA Derry Brigade]] in 1972 after a rapid increase in membership following [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] when [[1 PARA]] killed 13 unarmed demonstrators at a civil rights march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/18/newsid_4627000/4627967.stm |title=1974: Compensation for Bloody Sunday victims |publisher=BBC News |date= 18 December 1974|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Derry Brigade also controlled parts of northern [[County Londonderry]] and northeast [[County Donegal]].

County Armagh had four battalions, two very active ones in South Armagh and two less active unit in North Armagh. For this reason the Armagh IRA unit is often referred to as the [[Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade|South Armagh Brigade]]. Tyrone in particular had a large I.R.A. presence with three Brigades formed in the county, the West, Mid and notorious East Tyrone Brigades. The East Tyrone Brigade also drew in volunteers from nearby county Monaghan. The leadership structure at battalion and company level was the same: each had its own commanding officer, quartermaster, explosives officer and intelligence officer. There was sometimes a training officer or finance officer.

===Active service units===
From 1973, the IRA started to move away from the larger conventional military organisational principle owing to its security vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;Hoggart, Simon ''IRA may cut middle men to reduce arrests'', The Guardian 18 August 1973&lt;/ref&gt; A system of two parallel types of unit within an IRA brigade was introduced in place of the battalion structures. Firstly, the old "company" structures were used for tasks such as "policing" nationalist areas, intelligence-gathering, and hiding weapons. These were essential support activities. However, the bulk of actual attacks were the responsibility of a second type of unit, the [[active service unit]] (ASU). To improve security and operational capacity, these ASUs were smaller, tight-knit cells, usually consisting of five to eight members. The ASU's weapons were controlled by a brigade's [[quartermaster]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, page 158&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that in the late 1980s the IRA had roughly 300 members in ASUs and about another 450 serving in supporting roles.&lt;ref name="O'Brien, p. 161"&gt;O'Brien, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exception to this reorganisation was the [[Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade|South Armagh Brigade]], which retained its traditional hierarchy and battalion structure and used relatively large numbers of volunteers in its actions.&lt;ref&gt;Moloney, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; South Armagh did not have the same problems with security that other brigades had.

The IRA's Southern Command, located in the Republic of Ireland, consists of a [[Dublin]] Brigade and a number of smaller units in rural areas. These were charged mainly with the importation and storage of arms for the Northern units and with raising finances through robberies and other means.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:ProvisionalIRAbadge.JPG|thumb|right|An IRA badge – the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] is frequently used to symbolise the origins of the Provisional IRA.]]

In August 1969, a confrontation between [[Catholic]] residents of the [[Bogside]] and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) in [[Derry]] following an [[Apprentice Boys of Derry]] march led to a large communal riot now referred to as the [[Battle of the Bogside]] – three days of fighting between rioters throwing stones and petrol bombs on one side, and police who saturated the area with [[CS gas]] and other [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] on the other.

Protests organised by the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] in support of the Bogsiders were held elsewhere in the region, sparking retaliation by [[Protestant]] mobs; the subsequent burning, damage to property and intimidation, largely against the minority community, forced 1,800 people (mostly Catholics) from their homes in Belfast in what became known as the [[Northern Ireland riots of August 1969]], with over 200 Catholic homes being destroyed or requiring major repairs.&lt;ref name="The Provisional IRA' p. 117" /&gt; A number of people were killed on both sides, some by the police. The [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|Irish Republican Army]] had been poorly armed and its defence of Catholic-majority areas from [[Ulster loyalist]]s, which had been considered one of its traditional roles since the 1920s, was seen by many as inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;''The Provisional IRA'' by Patrick Bishop and Eamonn Mallie ({{ISBN|0-552-13337-X}}), pp. 108–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Veteran republicans were critical of the IRA's [[Dublin]] leadership which, for political reasons, had refused to prepare for aggressive action in advance of the violence.&lt;ref&gt;''Provos, the IRA and Sinn Féin'', page 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bishop and Mallie, pages 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 August [[Joe Cahill]], [[Seamus Twomey]], [[Dáithí Ó Conaill]], [[Billy McKee]] and several other future Provisional leaders came together in Belfast intending to remove the Belfast leadership and turn back to traditional militant republicanism.&lt;ref name="mb125"&gt;Bishop and Mallie, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Although the pro-[[Cathal Goulding|Goulding]] commander [[Billy McMillen]] stayed in command, he was told it was only for three months and he was not to have any communication with the IRA's Dublin based leadership.&lt;ref name="mb125"/&gt;

Traditional republicans formed the "Provisional" Army Council in December 1969, after an IRA convention was held at Knockvicar House in [[Boyle, County Roscommon]].&lt;ref&gt;''God and the Gun: The Church and Irish Terrorism'' by Martin Dillon ({{ISBN|978-0415923637}}), page 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Political Parties in the Republic of Ireland'' by Michael Gallagher ({{ISBN|978-0719017421}}), page 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Workers' Party' pg 145"&gt;''The Lost Revolution – the story of the Official IRA and the Workers' Party'' by Brian Hanley and Scott Millar pg 145&lt;/ref&gt; The two main issues were the acceptance of the "National Liberation Strategy" and a motion to end [[abstentionism]] and to recognise the British, Irish and Northern Ireland parliaments. While the motion on the "National Liberation Strategy" was passed unanimously&lt;ref name="Workers' Party' pg 145"/&gt; the motion on abstentionism was only passed by 28 votes to 12. Opponents of this change argued strongly against the ending of abstentionism, and when the vote took place, [[Seán Mac Stíofáin]], present as IRA Director of Intelligence, announced that he no longer considered that the IRA leadership represented republican goals.&lt;ref&gt;Mallie, Bishop p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was no walkout. Those opposed, who included Mac Stíofáin and [[Ruairí Ó Brádaigh]], refused to go forward for election to the new IRA Executive.&lt;ref&gt;Robert White, Ruairi O Bradaigh, the Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary, 2006, Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

While others canvassed support throughout Ireland, Mac Stíofáin was a key person making a connection with the Belfast IRA under Billy McKee and Joe Cahill, who had refused to take orders from the IRA's Dublin leadership since September 1969, in protest at their failure to defend Catholic areas in August.&lt;ref&gt;''Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA'' by Richard English ({{ISBN|0-330-49388-4}}), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Provos, the IRA and Sinn Féin'', page 65&lt;/ref&gt; Nine out of thirteen IRA units in Belfast sided with the Provisionals in December 1969, roughly 120 activists and 500 supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Mallie, Bishop p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The first "Provisional" Army Council was composed of Seán Mac Stíofáin, Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, Paddy Mulcahy, Sean Tracey, Leo Martin, and Joe Cahill.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Bishop and Eamonn Mallie, The Provisional IRA, page 137&lt;/ref&gt; They issued their first public statement on 28 December 1969, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We declare our allegiance to the 32 county Irish republic, proclaimed at [[Easter Rising|Easter 1916]], established by the [[First Dáil|first Dáil Éireann]] in 1919, overthrown by forces of arms in 1922 and suppressed to this day by the existing British-imposed six-county and twenty-six-county partition states.&lt;ref&gt;''Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA'' by Richard English ({{ISBN|0-330-49388-4}}), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Provisional IRA issued all its public statements under the pseudonym "P. O'Neill" of the "Irish Republican Publicity Bureau, Dublin".&lt;ref name=poneill&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4290212.stm Who is P O'Neill?]&amp;nbsp;– [[BBC News]] article, 22 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, it was Seán Mac Stiofáin, as chief of staff of the IRA, who invented the name. However, under his usage, the name was written and pronounced according to [[Irish orthography]] and pronunciation as "P. Ó Néill". According to [[Danny Morrison (Irish republican)|Danny Morrison]], the pseudonym "S. O'Neill" was used during the 1940s.&lt;ref name=poneill/&gt;

The [[Sinn Féin]] party split along the same lines on 11 January 1970, when a third of the delegates walked out of the [[Ard Fheis]] in protest at the party leadership's attempt to force through the ending of abstentionism, despite its failure to achieve a two-thirds majority vote of delegates required to change the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Taylor | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Taylor (Journalist) | title = Provos The IRA &amp; Sinn Féin | publisher = [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] |year=1997 | page = 67 | isbn = 978-0-7475-3818-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the declared support of that faction of Sinn Féin, the early Provisional IRA was extremely suspicious of political activity, arguing rather for the primacy of armed struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

What would become the Provisional IRA received arms and funding from the [[Fianna Fáil]]-led [[Irish government]] in 1969, resulting in the 1970 [[Arms Crisis]] in which criminal charges were pursued against two former government ministers and others. Roughly £100,000 was donated by the Irish government to "Defence Committees" in Catholic areas and, according to historian [[Richard English]], "there is now no doubt that some money did go from the Dublin government to the proto-Provisionals".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = English | first = Richard | title = Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA | publisher = [[Pan Books]] |year=2003 | page = 119 | isbn = 978-0-330-49388-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Provisionals maintained the principles of the pre-1969 IRA; they considered both British rule in Northern Ireland and the government of the Republic of Ireland to be illegitimate, insisting that the Provisional IRA's Army Council was the only valid government, as head of an all-island [[Irish Republic]]. This belief was based on a series of perceived political inheritances which constructed a legal continuity from the [[Second Dáil]] (see also [[Irish republican legitimatism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, pp. 289–291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Northern Ireland: The SDLP and the House of Lords | author = Robin Sheeran | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/4628112.stm |publisher=BBC News| date = 21 January 2006 | accessdate =27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1971, the Provisionals had inherited most of the existing IRA organisation in the north, as well as the more militant IRA members in the rest of Ireland. In addition, they recruited many young nationalists from the north, who had not been involved in the IRA before but had been radicalised by the violence that broke out in 1969. These people were known in republican parlance as "sixty niners", having joined after 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Moloney, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisional IRA adopted the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] as symbol of the Irish republican rebirth in 1969. One of its slogans was "out of the ashes rose the Provisionals".&lt;ref&gt;Nordstrom, Caroline and Martin, Joann (1992) ''The Paths to domination, resistance, and terror''. University of California Press, p. 199. {{ISBN|0-520-07316-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial phase===
Following the violence of August 1969, the IRA began to arm and train to protect nationalist areas from further attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Civil Rights to Armalites |last=Ó Dochartaigh |first=Niall |year=2005 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |isbn=978-1-4039-4431-3 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Provisionals' split from the [[Official Irish Republican Army|Official IRA]], the Provisional IRA began planning for offensive action against what it viewed as British occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionary |last=MacStiofáin |first=Seán |year=1979 |publisher=Free Ireland Book Club |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Official IRA were opposed to such a campaign because they felt it would lead to sectarian conflict, which would defeat their strategy of uniting the workers from both sides of the sectarian divide. The IRA [[Border Campaign (IRA)|Border Campaign]] in the 1950s had avoided actions in urban centres of Northern Ireland to avoid civilian casualties and probable resulting sectarian violence.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Bishop, Eamon Mallie, The Provisional IRA, p. 40, "It aimed at destroying people rather than property and all units were under instruction to avoid civilian bloodshed. For this reason and because there were doubts about the Belfast IRA, which GHQ in Dublin to contain a traitor, there would be no action in the city".&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisional IRA, by contrast, was primarily an urban organisation, based originally in Belfast and Derry.

The Provisional IRA's strategy was to use force to cause the collapse of the [[government of Northern Ireland]] and to inflict such casualties on the British forces that the British government would be forced by public opinion to withdraw from Ireland. According to journalist Brendan O'Brien, "the thinking was that the war would be short and successful. Chief of Staff Seán Mac Stíofáin decided they would 'escalate, escalate and escalate' until the British agreed to go".&lt;ref name="O'Brien The Long War, p. 119"/&gt; This policy involved recruitment of volunteers and carrying out attacks on British forces, as well as mounting a bombing campaign against economic targets. In the early years of the conflict, IRA slogans spoke of, "Victory 1972" and then "Victory 1974".&lt;ref name="O'Brien, Long War, p. 107"/&gt; Its inspiration was the success of the "[[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Old IRA]]" in the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1922), which also relied on British public opinion to achieve its aims. In their assessment of the IRA campaign, the British Army would describe the years 1970–72 as the "insurgency phase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patfinucanecentre.org/misc/opbanner.pdf |title=AC 71842 Operation BANNER |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926091152/http://www.patfinucanecentre.org/misc/opbanner.pdf |archivedate=26 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British government held secret talks with the IRA leadership in 1972 to try and secure a ceasefire based on a compromise settlement, after the events of [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] led to an increase in IRA recruitment and support. The IRA agreed to a temporary ceasefire from 26 June to 9 July. In July 1972, Seán Mac Stíofáin, [[Dáithí Ó Conaill]], [[Ivor Bell]], [[Seamus Twomey]], [[Gerry Adams]] and [[Martin McGuinness]] met a British delegation led by [[William Whitelaw]]. The republicans refused to consider a peace settlement that did not include a commitment to British withdrawal, a retreat of the British Army to its barracks, and a release of republican prisoners. The British refused and the talks broke up.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time the IRA brought out the ''[[Éire Nua]]'' (New Ireland) policy, which advocated an all-Ireland [[Federation|federal]] republic, with decentralised governments and parliaments for each of the four historic [[provinces of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Moloney, page ?&lt;/ref&gt;

===1975 ceasefire===

By the mid-1970s, the hopes of the IRA leadership for a quick military victory were receding and the British military was unsure of when it would see any substantial success against the IRA. Secret meetings between Provisional IRA leaders Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and [[Billy McKee]] with British [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] [[Merlyn Rees]] secured an IRA ceasefire which began in February 1975. The IRA initially believed that this was the start of a long-term process of British withdrawal, but later came to the conclusion that the British were unwilling and/or unable to make concessions in areas they deemed crucial.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2001 184–185"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-dwdBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=ira%201975%20ceasefire%20breakdown#v=onepage&amp;q=ira%201975%20ceasefire%20breakdown&amp;f=false|title=Field Day Review 7|first1=James|last1=Chandler|first2=Kevin|last2=Honan|first3=Luke|last3=Gibbons|first4=Seamus|last4=Deane|first5=Niall|last5=Meehan|first6=Kerby|last6=Miller|first7=Lucy|last7=Cotter|first8=Tony|last8=Crowley|date=15 October 2011|publisher=Field Day Publications|via=Google Books|isbn=9780946755516}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the IRA leadership, most notably Gerry Adams, felt that the ceasefire was disastrous for the IRA, leading to infiltration by British informers, the arrest of many activists and a breakdown in IRA discipline resulting in [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997#Accusations of sectarian attacks|sectarian killings]] and a feud with fellow republicans in the Official IRA. At this time, the IRA leadership, short of money, weapons and members, was on the brink of calling off the campaign. However, the ceasefire was ended in January 1976 instead.&lt;ref name="Taylorp156"&gt;Taylor, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:IRA Resistance Poster.jpg|thumb|right|250px|IRA political poster from the 1980s, featuring a quote from [[Bobby Sands]] – "There can never be peace in Ireland until the foreign, oppressive British presence is removed, leaving all the Irish people as a unit to control their own affairs and determine their own destinies as a sovereign people, free in mind and body, separate and distinct physically, culturally and economically".]]

Thereafter, the IRA evolved a new strategy which they called the "Long War". This underpinned IRA strategy for the rest of the Troubles and involved the re-organisation of the IRA into small [[Clandestine cell system|cells]], an acceptance that their campaign would last many years before being successful and an increased emphasis on political activity through Sinn Féin. A republican document of the early 1980s states: "Both Sinn Féin and the IRA play different but converging roles in the war of national liberation. The Irish Republican Army wages an armed campaign... Sinn Féin maintains the propaganda war and is the public and political voice of the movement".&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1977 edition of the [[The Green Book (IRA training manual)|Green Book]], an induction and training manual used by the IRA, describes the strategy of the "Long War" in these terms:
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Gadams.jpg|left|frame|Gerry Adams, who helped to formulate the IRA's "Long War" strategy in the late 1970s and who was the main driving force behind republican peace initiatives since the late 1980s.]] --&gt;
# A [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] against enemy personnel [British Army] based on causing as many deaths as possible so as to create a demand from their [the British] people at home for their withdrawal.
# A bombing campaign aimed at making the enemy's financial interests in our country unprofitable while at the same time curbing long term investment in our country.
# To make the Six Counties... ungovernable except by colonial military rule.
# To sustain the war and gain support for its ends by National and International propaganda and publicity campaigns.
# By defending the war of liberation by punishing criminals, [[Collaborationism|collaborators]] and [[informant|informers]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confidential documents released on 30 December 2008 from the British state archives show that the IRA leadership proposed a ceasefire and peace talks to the British government in 1978. The British refused the offer. Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]] decided that there should be "positive rejection" of the approach on the basis that the republicans were not serious and "see their campaign as a long haul". Republic of Ireland state documents from the same period say that the IRA had made a similar offer to the British the previous year. An [[Irish Defence Forces]] document, dated 15 February 1977, states that "It is now known that feelers were sent out at Christmas by the top IRA leadership to interest the British authorities in another long ceasefire."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Irish Times]]'', 30 December 2008, [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2008/1230/1230581469072.html?via=mr Britain rejected secret IRA peace talks offer, 1978 archives reveal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023174605/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2008/1230/1230581469072.html?via=mr |date=23 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Éire Nua'' policy was discontinued by the Army Council in 1979&lt;ref&gt;Moloney, page 182&lt;/ref&gt; but remained Sinn Féin policy until 1982,&lt;ref&gt;Moloney, page 194&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the sequence in which the old leadership of the republican movement were being sidelined.

[[File:Ira funeral1981.jpg|thumb|right|IRA funeral, 1981]]

IRA prisoners convicted after March 1976 did not have [[Special Category Status]] applied in prison. In response, more than 500 prisoners refused to [[Blanket protest|wear prison clothes]]. This activity culminated in the [[1981 Irish hunger strike]], when seven IRA and three [[Irish National Liberation Army]] members starved themselves to death in pursuit of political status. The hunger strike leader [[Bobby Sands]] and [[Anti H-Block]] activist [[Owen Carron]] were elected to the [[British Parliament]], and two other protesting prisoners were elected to the [[Dáil]]. In addition, there were work stoppages and large demonstrations all over Ireland in sympathy with the hunger strikers. More than 100,000 people attended the funeral of Sands, the first hunger striker to die.&lt;ref&gt;Richard English, ''Armed struggle: the history of the IRA'', p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success of IRA hunger strikers in mobilising support and winning elections on an Anti H-Block platform in 1981, republicans increasingly devoted time and resources to electoral politics, through the Sinn Féin party. [[Danny Morrison (Irish republican)|Danny Morrison]] summed up this policy at a 1981 Sinn Féin [[Ard Fheis]] (annual meeting) as a "ballot paper in this hand and an Armalite in the other".&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace process===
The success of the [[1981 Irish hunger strike]] in mobilising support and winning elections led to what was referred to by [[Danny Morrison (writer)|Danny Morrison]] as, "the [[Armalite and ballot box strategy]]" with more time and resources devoted to political activity. The perceived stalemate along with British government's hints of a compromise&lt;ref name=comp&gt;O'Brien, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; and secret approaches in the early 1990s led republican leaders increasingly to look for a political agreement to end the conflict,&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Taylor (journalist)|Taylor, Peter]], ''Behind the mask: The IRA and Sinn Féin'', Chapter 21: ''Stalemate'', pp. 246–261&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brooken&gt;O'Brien, pp. 293–294&lt;/ref&gt; with a broadening dissociation of Sinn Féin from the IRA. Following negotiations with the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) and secret talks with British civil servants, the IRA ultimately called a ceasefire in 1994 on the understanding that Sinn Féin would be included in political talks for a settlement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; When the British government then demanded the disarmament of the IRA before it allowed Sinn Féin into multiparty talks, the organisation called off its ceasefire in February 1996. The renewed bombings caused severe economic damage, with the [[1996 Manchester bombing|Manchester bombing]] and the [[Docklands bombing]] causing approximately £800 million in combined damage. After the ceasefire was reinstated in July 1997, Sinn Féin was admitted into all-party talks, which produced the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998. The IRA's armed campaign, primarily in Northern Ireland but also in England and mainland Europe, caused the deaths of approximately 1,800 people. The dead included around 1,100 members of the British security forces, and about 630 civilians.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; The IRA itself lost 275–300 members,&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; of an estimated 10,000 total over the 30-year period.&lt;ref name=Moloneyxiv&gt;{{Cite book| last = Moloney |first = Ed | authorlink = Ed Moloney | title = A Secret History of the IRA | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] |year=2002 | pages = xiv | isbn = 978-0-14-101041-0 | nopp = true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1970 and 2005, the IRA had detonated 19,000 [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs) in the United Kingdom, an average of one every 17 hours for three and a half decades, arguably making it "the biggest terrorist bombing campaign in history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.ipcprintservices.com/display_article.php?id=177490|title=IRA TECHNOLOGY|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to author [[Ed Moloney]], the IRA made an attempt to escalate the conflict with the so-called "[[Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997#Libyan arms and the "Tet Offensive"|Tet Offensive]]" in the 1980s, which was reluctantly approved by the Army Council and did not prove successful. On the other hand, public speeches from two [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland Secretaries of State]], [[Peter Brooke]]&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, pp. 209–212&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Patrick Mayhew]]&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; hint that, given the cessation of violence, a political compromise with the IRA was possible. Gerry Adams entered talks with [[John Hume]], the leader of the moderate nationalist [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) in 1993, and secret talks were also conducted since 1991 between Martin McGuinness and a senior [[MI6]] officer, [[Michael Oatley]].&lt;ref name=comp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brooken/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Adams increasingly tried to disassociate Sinn Féin from the IRA, claiming they were separate organisations and refusing to speak on behalf of the IRA.&lt;ref&gt;Moloney p345. "Adams was frustrated but nevertheless later managed to put some formal distance between Sinn Féin and the IRA. Sinn Féin let it be known in January 1991 that the party would no longer act as 'proxy spokespersons' for the IRA. A Sinn Féin source told the Irish Times, 'The IRA can speak for itself'.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[Republican Movement (Ireland)|Republican Movement]] (the IRA and Sinn Féin), the new strategy was described by the acronym "TUAS", meaning either "Tactical Use of Armed Struggle" or "Totally Unarmed Strategy".&lt;ref&gt;Moloney, p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRA [[ceasefire]] in 1997 formed part of a process that led to the 1998 Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement. One aim of the Agreement is that all paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland cease their activities and disarm by May 2000. In October 1997, the US stopped designating the IRA as a terrorist organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch97.htm|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1997|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calls from Sinn Féin led the IRA to commence disarming in a process that was monitored by Canadian General [[John de Chastelain]]'s [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning|decommissioning body]] in October 2001. However, following the collapse of the Stormont power-sharing government in 2002, which was partly triggered by allegations that republican spies were operating within Parliament Buildings and the Civil Service, the IRA temporarily broke off contact with General de Chastelain.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In December 2004, attempts to persuade the IRA to disarm entirely collapsed when the Democratic Unionist Party, under [[Ian Paisley]], insisted on photographic evidence. Justice Minister Michael McDowell (in public, and often) insisted that there would need to be a complete end to IRA activity.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

At the beginning of February 2005, the IRA declared that it was withdrawing from the disarmament process, but in July 2005 it declared that its campaign of violence was over, and that transparent mechanisms would be used, under the de Chastelain process, to satisfy the Northern Ireland communities that it was disarming totally.

===End of the armed campaign===
On 28 July 2005, the [[IRA Army Council]] announced an end to [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997|the armed campaign]], stating that it would work to achieve its aims solely by peaceful political means. The Army Council stated that it had ordered volunteers to dump all weapons and to end all paramilitary activity. It also announced that the IRA would complete the process of disarmament as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk" /&gt;

This was not the first time that an organisation calling itself the IRA had issued orders to dump arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/john-horgan/arms-dumps-and-ira-1923-32|title=Arms Dumps and the IRA, 1923–32 – History Today|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its defeat in the [[Irish Civil War]] in 1924 and at the end of its unsuccessful [[Border Campaign (Irish Republican Army)|Border Campaign]] in 1962, the IRA Army Council issued similar orders. However, this was the first time that an IRA had voluntarily decided to dispose of its arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/northern_ireland/1604301.stm |title=IRA in arms breakthrough |publisher=BBC News |date=23 October 2001 |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors, like Patrick McCarthy, Peter Taylor and Brendan O'Brien concluded that, unlike previous IRA campaigns, the provisionals were not defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Patrick (2002).

In September 2005, international weapons inspectors supervised the full disarmament of the IRA. On 26 September, the [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning]] (IICD) announced that "the totality of the IRA's arsenal" had been decommissioned. The IRA invited two independent witnesses to view the secret disarmament work: Catholic priest Father [[Alec Reid]] and Protestant minister Reverend Harold Good.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Kevin (27 September 2005). [http://www.boston.com/news/world/articles/2005/09/27/maintaining_belief_in_peace_aided_n_ireland_transformation Maintaining belief in peace aided N. Ireland transformation] ''Boston Globe''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Paisley]], leader of the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP), complained that the witnesses were not unbiased, because they were appointed by the IRA itself. Nationalists saw his comments as reflecting his opposition to nationalists in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Weapons witnesses 'IRA-nominated' | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4286266.stm |publisher=BBC News| date = 27 September 2005 | accessdate =17 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, there have been occasional claims in the media that the IRA had not decommissioned all of its weaponry. In response to such claims, the [[Independent Monitoring Commission]] (IMC) stated in its tenth report that the IRA had decommissioned all weaponry "under its control". It said that if any weapons had been kept, they would have been kept by individuals and against IRA orders.&lt;ref&gt;Independent Monitoring Commission (26 April 2006).

There have also been claims that the IRA is still active and has carried out punishment shootings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4ni.co.uk/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=109172 |title=Provos 'Have Not Gone Away', 30&amp;nbsp;March&amp;nbsp;2010, Northern Ireland Newspapers |publisher=4ni.co.uk |date=30 March 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londonderrysentinel.co.uk/news/Were-Provos-behind-shooting-incident.6558729.jp |title=Were Provos behind shooting incident in Gobnascale?

In September 2008, the Independent Monitoring Commission stated in its nineteenth report that the IRA was "committed to the political path" and was no longer "a threat to peace or to democratic politics". It concluded that the IRA as an organisation was being allowed to wither away and was "beyond recall": it had disbanded its military departments, stopped recruiting or training members, lost its military capability, and the Army Council was "no longer operational". The report also said that the IRA is not involved in any criminal activity, but that some members have engaged in criminal activity without the sanction or support of the organisation.&lt;ref name="IMC12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said in 2011: "The war is over. The IRA is gone. The IRA embraced, facilitated and supported the peace process. When a democratic and peaceful alternative to armed struggle was created the IRA left the stage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/adams-condemns-violent-dissidents-15140406.html| title=Adams condemns violent dissidents}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Adams said: "The IRA is gone.

In February 2015, the [[Garda Commissioner]] stated that [[Gardaí]] have no evidence that the IRA's military structure remains or that the IRA is engaged in crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/regionals/argus/news/no-info-provos-involved-in-crimes-31018052.html "'No info' provos involved in crimes"]. ''Irish Independent'', 28 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland|PSNI]] Chief Constable stated that the IRA no longer exists as a paramilitary organisation. He said that some of its structure remains, but that the group is committed to following a peaceful political path and is not engaged in criminal activity or directing violence.&lt;ref name=psni-aug15&gt;[http://webarchive.proni.gov.uk/20160201232459/http://www.psni.police.uk/index/news%2Darchive/newpage%2D4/august%2D2015/chief_constable_s_statement___psni_s_assessment_of_the_current_status_of_the_provisional_ira. "Chief Constable's statement – PSNI's assessment of the current status of the Provisional IRA"]. [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI). 22 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he added that some members have engaged in criminal activity or violence for their own ends.&lt;ref name=psni-aug15/&gt; The statement was in response to the recent killings of two former IRA members. In May, former IRA commander [[Gerard Davison]] was shot dead in Belfast. He had been involved in [[Direct Action Against Drugs]] and it is believed he was killed by an organized crime gang. Three months later, former IRA member Kevin McGuigan was also shot dead in Belfast. It is believed he was killed by the group Action Against Drugs, in revenge for the Davison killing. The Chief Constable believed that IRA members collaborated with Action Against Drugs, but without the sanction of the IRA.&lt;ref name=psni-aug15/&gt; In response, the UK government commissioned the [[Independent Assessment of Paramilitary Organisations]].

The organisation remains classified as a proscribed terrorist group in the UK and as an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref name="Proscribed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"/&gt; Two small groups split from the IRA, the [[Continuity IRA]] in 1986, and the [[Real IRA]] in 1997. Both reject the Good Friday Agreement and continue to engage in paramilitary activity.

In the early days of [[the Troubles]] the IRA was very poorly armed, mainly with old World War II weaponry such as [[M1 Garand]]s and [[Thompson submachine gun]]s, but starting in the early 1970s it procured large amounts of modern weaponry from such sources as supporters in the United States, Libyan leader Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]],&lt;ref name="Taylorp156"/&gt; and arms dealers in Europe, America, the Middle East and elsewhere. The Libyans supplied the IRA with the RPG-7.

[[File:RPG-7 detached.jpg|thumb|The [[RPG-7]]]]

In the first years of the conflict, the IRA's main activities were providing firepower to support nationalist rioters and defending nationalist areas from attacks. The IRA gained much of its support from these activities, as they were widely perceived within the nationalist community as being defenders of [[Irish nationalist]] and Roman Catholic people against aggression.&lt;ref&gt;English, pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grand-Hotel-Following-Bomb-Attack-1984-10-12.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of the [[Brighton hotel bombing]]]]

From 1971–1994, the IRA launched a sustained offensive armed campaign that mainly targeted the British Army, the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC), the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR), and economic targets in Northern Ireland.&lt;!--The first half of the 1970s was the most intense period of the IRA campaign.---&gt; In addition, some IRA members carried out attacks against Protestant civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-13857495 Kingsmills families demand full inquiry into massacre] [[BBC News]] 21 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRA was chiefly active in Northern Ireland, although it took its campaign to England and mainland Europe. The IRA also targeted certain British government officials, politicians, judges, establishment figures, British Army and police officers in England, and in other areas such as the Republic of Ireland, West Germany and the Netherlands. By the early 1990s, the bulk of the IRA activity was carried out by the South Armagh Brigade,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} well known through its [[South Armagh Sniper (1990-1997)|sniping operations]] and attacks on British Army helicopters. The bombing campaign principally targeted political, economic and military targets, and approximately 60 civilians were killed by the IRA in England during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Crosstabulations (two-way tables) | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/crosstabs.html |publisher=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] | accessdate =17 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that this bombing campaign helped convince the British government (who had hoped to contain the conflict to Northern Ireland with its [[Ulsterisation]] policy) to negotiate with [[Sinn Féin]] after the IRA ceasefires of August 1994 and July 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maillot Agnès (2005). ''New Sinn Féin: Irish republicanism in the twenty-first century''. Routledge, p. 32. {{ISBN|0-415-32197-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s the IRA had become skilled in using mortars and were on a level that was comparable to military models. Seven IRA mortar attacks resulted in fatalities or serious injuries. The IRA's development of mortar tactics was a response to the heavy fortifications on RUC and British Army bases. Mortars were useful to the IRA as they could hit targets at short range, which could lead to effective attacks in built-up urban areas. The mortars used by the IRA were often self made and developed by the Engineering Department of the Army General Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ackerman|first=Gary. A|date=Spring 2016|title=The Provisional Irish Republican Army and the Development of Mortars|url=http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1501&amp;context=jss|journal=Journal of Strategic Security|volume=9|pages=12–34|via=Scholar Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 1994, the IRA declared an indefinite ceasefire. However, from February 1996 until July 1997, the IRA called off its 1994 ceasefire because of its dissatisfaction with the state of negotiations. They re-instated the ceasefire in July 1997, and it has been in operation since then.&lt;ref&gt;Moloney, p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRA decommissioned all of its remaining arms between July and September 2005. The decommissioning of its weaponry was supervised by the [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning]] (IICD). Among the weaponry, estimated by [[Jane's Information Group]], to have been destroyed as part of this process were:
* 1,000 rifles
* 2 tonnes of [[Semtex]]
* 20–30 [[heavy machine gun]]s
* 7 [[Man-portable air-defense systems|surface-to-air missiles]] (unused)
* 7 [[flamethrower]]s
* 1,200 [[detonator]]s
* 11 [[rocket-propelled grenade]] launchers
* 90 [[handgun]]s
* 100+ [[hand grenade]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = IRA guns: The list of weapons | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4284048.stm |publisher=BBC News | date = 26 September 2005 | accessdate =26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sniperatwork.jpg|thumbnail|A "Sniper at Work" sign in Crossmaglen. The IRA used snipers as a tactic in south Armagh to disrupt foot patrols]]
Having compared the weapons destroyed with the British security forces' estimates of the IRA weaponry, and because of the IRA's full involvement in the process of destroying the weapons, the IICD arrived at their conclusion that all IRA weaponry has been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Colonel Gaddafi is known to have given the British Government a detailed inventory of weapons he gave to the IRA in the 1970s and 1980s, this list was handed to British intelligence in 1995. See Bowyer Bell Page 578&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the process of decommissioning was completed, unnamed sources in [[MI5]] and the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI) have reported to the press that not all IRA arms were destroyed during the process. This claim remains unsubstantiated so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 8&amp;nbsp;February&amp;nbsp;2006 (pt 26) |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/debtext/60208-26.htm |publisher=House of Commons |date=8 February 2006 |accessdate=18 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021172806/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/debtext/60208-26.htm |archivedate=21 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its report dated April 2006 the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) stated that it had no reason to disbelieve the IRA or to suspect that it had not fully decommissioned.

In mid-July 2013, the Gardaí displayed arms and explosives (Semtex) recently recovered from dissident republicans in the Dublin area. The Gardaí believe this Semtex to have come from the Libyan connection back in the 1980s and therefore should have been decommissioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/regional/call-for-ira-weapons-probe-1-5282822 Belfast Newsletter], 14 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0711/461949-weapons-seized/ Dublin arms find included Provisional IRA weapons], RTÉ News, 11 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/arms-explosives-semtex-dublin Arms and explosives – including semtex – seized by police in Dublin], ''The Guardian'', 11 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
Apart from its armed campaign, the IRA has also been involved in many other activities.

===Sectarian attacks===
The IRA publicly condemned sectarianism and sectarian attacks.&lt;ref name=english173&gt;English, Richard. ''Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA''. Oxford University Press, 2004. p.173&lt;/ref&gt; However, some IRA members did carry out sectarian attacks.&lt;ref name=english173/&gt; Of those killed by the IRA, Sutton classifies 130 (about 7%) of them as sectarian killings of Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Malcolm. [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/book/ Revised and Updated Extracts from Sutton's Book]. [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike loyalists, the IRA denied responsibility for sectarian attacks and the members involved used covernames, such as "[[South Armagh Republican Action Force|Republican Action Force]]".&lt;ref&gt;David McKittrick &amp; David McVea.

Some unionists allege that the IRA took part in "ethnic cleansing" of the Protestant minority in rural border areas, such as [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/regional/ira-border-campaign-was-ethnic-cleansing-1-4909522 "IRA border campaign 'was ethnic cleansing'"].

''[[Irish Independent]]''. 24 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Many local Protestants allegedly believed that the IRA tried to force them into leaving. However, most Protestants killed by the IRA in these areas were members of the security forces, and there was no exodus of Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ulster.ac.uk/releases/2006/2223.html "Border Killings – Liberation Struggle or Ethnic Cleansing?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195508/http://news.ulster.ac.uk/releases/2006/2223.html |date=3 March 2016 }}.

===Alleged involvement in crime===
To fund its campaign, the IRA was allegedly involved in criminal activities such as robberies, [[counterfeit]]ing, [[protection racket]]s, kidnapping for ransom, [[fuel laundering]] and [[cigarette smuggling]].&lt;ref name=connelly204&gt;Connelly, Mark.

It is estimated that, by the 1990s, the IRA needed £10.5 million a year to operate.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Phil. "Chapter 6: Terrorist financing and organized crime". ''Countering the Financing of Terrorism''. Routledge, 2007. p.137&lt;/ref&gt;

IRA supporters argue that the IRA's "securing of funds by extralegal methods is justified as a means to achieve a political goal. Unlike crimes committed for personal gain, IRA operations are considered strategic attacks against an oppressive state".&lt;ref name=connelly204/&gt; However, this activity allowed the British Government to portray the IRA as no more than a criminal gang.&lt;ref name=connelly204/&gt;

It was estimated that the IRA carried out 1,000 armed robberies in Northern Ireland, mostly of banks and post offices.&lt;ref name=connelly204/&gt; It was accused of involvement in the biggest bank raid in Irish history—the 2004 [[Northern Bank robbery]]—when £26.5 million was stolen from the Northern Bank in Belfast city centre. The PSNI, the Independent Monitoring Commission and the British and Irish governments all accused the IRA of involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Bank heist blame 'led to IRA ending arms deal' | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1482679/Bank-heist-blame-led-to-IRA-ending-arms-deal.html |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 3 February 2005 | accessdate =23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Fourth Report of the Independent Monitoring Commission |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/imc/imc100205.pdf |author= Independent Monitoring Commission |year=2005 |publisher=The Stationery Office |accessdate=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that the IRA needed the money to pay pensions to its volunteers, and to ensure that hardliners stuck with the peace strategy.&lt;ref name=connelly204/&gt; The IRA denied involvement, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gang threatened to kill abductees and families |author=Alan Erwin |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2005/02/18/story359672846.asp |website=[[Irish Examiner]] |date=18 February 2005 |accessdate=11 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623133141/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2005/02/18/story359672846.asp |archivedate=23 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the IRA was against drug dealing and prostitution, "both for 'moral' reasons and because it would be unpopular within its own communities".&lt;ref&gt;Dingley, James. ''The IRA''. ABC-CLIO, 2012. p.180&lt;/ref&gt; The Chief of the RUC's Drugs Squad, Kevin Sheehy, said "the Provisional IRA did its best to stop volunteers from becoming directly involved [in drugs]" and noted one occasion when an IRA member caught with a small amount of cannabis was "disowned and humiliated" in his local area.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Sheehy (2008), ''More Questions than Answers – Reflections on a Life in the RUC'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; The IRA often targeted drug dealers. Many were given punishment shootings or banished, and some were killed. However, there are claims the IRA "licensed" certain dealers to operate and forced them to pay protection money.&lt;ref name="David Lister and Sean O'Neill"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|title=Playing the 'Green Card' – Financing the Provisional IRA: Part 1 |url=http://www.apgml.org/frameworks/docs/7/IRA%20financing%20models.pdf |author=[[John Horgan (political psychologist)|John Horgan]] and Max Taylor |publisher=Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering |accessdate=25 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911211621/http://www.apgml.org/frameworks/docs/7/IRA%20financing%20models.pdf |archivedate=11 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hidden Agenda To IRA Hits on Drug Dealers |author=Vincent Kearney |newspaper=The Sunday Times |date=15 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in 2005, Gerry Adams said "There is no place in republicanism for anyone involved in criminality". However, he went on to say "we refuse to criminalise those who break the law in pursuit of legitimate political objectives".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sinn Fein Leader Reasserts Rejection of Criminal Activity |first=Brian |last=Laverty |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=6 March 2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/06/world/sinn-fein-leader-reasserts-rejection-of-criminal-activity.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Independent Monitoring Commission stated that the IRA was no longer involved in criminality, but that some members have engaged in criminality for their own ends, without the sanction or support of the IRA.&lt;ref name="IMC12"/&gt;

===Vigilantism===
[[File:Provo-landOmagh.jpg|200px|thumb|An IRA signpost with the word "Provoland" underneath in Strathroy, Omagh, County Tyrone.]]
During the conflict, the IRA took on the role of policing in some Catholic/nationalist areas of Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name=weitzer157&gt;Weitzer, Ronald John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=67hoMfy4kTsC&amp;pg=PA158#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Policing Under Fire: Ethnic Conflict and Police-Community Relations in Northern Ireland'']. SUNY Press, 1995, pp.157-158&lt;/ref&gt; Many Catholics/nationalists did not trust the official police force—the Royal Ulster Constabulary—and saw it as biased against their community.&lt;ref name=weitzer157/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, Robert. ''In Time of War''. Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1983. p.189&lt;/ref&gt; The RUC found it difficult to operate in certain nationalist neighbourhoods and only entered in armoured convoys, due to the threat of attack from rioters and the IRA. In these neighbourhoods, many residents expected the IRA to act as a policing force,&lt;ref name=weitzer157/&gt;&lt;ref name=eriksson&gt;Eriksson, Anna. ''Justice in Transition: Community restorative justice in Northern Ireland.'' Routledge, 2013. pp.39-40&lt;/ref&gt; and such policing "provided the IRA a certain propaganda value".&lt;ref&gt;Goodspeed, Michael. ''When Reason Fails: Portraits of Armies at War''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002. p.80&lt;/ref&gt; The IRA also sought to minimize contact between residents and the RUC, because residents might pass on information or be forced to become a police informer.&lt;ref name=weitzer157/&gt; The IRA set up [[arbitration]] panels that would adjudicate and investigate complaints from locals about criminal or 'anti-social' activities.&lt;ref&gt;Hamill, Heather. ''The Hoods: Crime and Punishment in Belfast''. Princeton University Press, 2010. pp.33-34&lt;/ref&gt; Those responsible for minor offences would be given a warning, be made to compensate the offendee, or be made to do community work. Those responsible for more serious and repeat offences could be given a punishment beating or [[kneecapping]], or be banished from the community.

The IRA's vigilantism has been repeatedly condemned as "[[Extrajudicial punishment|summary justice]]". However, on several occasions the British authorities have recognized the IRA's policing role.&lt;ref name=findlay&gt;Findlay, Mark. ''Alternative policing styles: cross-cultural perspectives''. United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, 1993. p.146&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1971, the IRA and British Army held secret talks aimed at stopping persistent rioting in Ballymurphy. It was agreed that the IRA would be responsible for policing there, but the agreement was short-lived.&lt;ref name=reed158&gt;Reed, David. ''Ireland: The Key to the British Revolution''. Larkin Publications, 1984. pp.158-159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moloney, Ed. ''A Secret History of the IRA''. Penguin, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1975 ceasefire, the government agreed to the setting up of 'incident centres' in nationalist areas. They were staffed by Sinn Féin members and were to deal with incidents that might endanger the truce. Residents went there to report crime as well as to make complaints about the security forces. The incident centres were seen by locals as 'IRA police stations' and gave some legitimacy to the IRA as a policing force.&lt;ref name=findlay/&gt;

Political opponents accused the IRA and Sinn Féin of a coverup. The Sinn Féin leader apologized to victims who were "let down" by the IRA and admitted it "was ill-equipped to deal with such matters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/paramilitaries-shot-and-exiled-many-alleged-sex-abusers-1.1981260 "Paramilitaries shot and exiled many alleged sex abusers"].

===Killing of alleged informers===
The IRA took a hard line against anyone believed to be an [[informant|informer]] – i.e. secretly passing information about IRA activity to British forces. The IRA regarded them as traitors and a threat to the organisation and lives of its members. Suspected informers were dealt with by the IRA's [[Internal Security Unit]] (ISU). It carried out an investigation, interrogated the suspect and passed judgement. IRA members who confessed to being informers were killed with a shot to the head. Civilian informers were regarded as [[Collaborationism|collaborators]] and were usually either killed or exiled. The IRA killed 59 alleged informers, about half of them IRA members and half of them Catholic civilians. The bodies of alleged informers were usually left in public as a warning to others. Twelve, however, were secretly buried and became known as "[[Disappeared (Northern Ireland)|the Disappeared]]".

One particularly controversial killing of an alleged informer was that of [[Murder of Jean McConville|Jean McConville]]. A Catholic civilian and widowed mother-of-ten, her body was secretly buried and not found until thirty years later. The IRA has since issued a general apology, saying it "regrets the suffering of all the families whose loved ones were killed and buried by the IRA".

The [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|original IRA]], as well as loyalist paramilitaries, also had a policy of killing alleged informers.&lt;ref&gt;Melaugh, Martin. [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/victims/gis/maps/gismaps-20.html Killings of Alleged Informers], [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN); accessed 5 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with other republican paramilitaries===
The IRA has also feuded with other republican paramilitary groups such as the [[Official IRA]] in the 1970s and the [[Irish People's Liberation Organisation]] in the 1990s.

Leading [[Real Irish Republican Army]] (RIRA) member Joseph O'Connor was shot dead in [[Ballymurphy Massacre|Ballymurphy]], west Belfast on 11 October 2000. Claims have been made by O'Connor's family and people associated with the RIRA that he was killed by the IRA as the result of a feud between the organisations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Controversy over republican's murder | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/975322.stm |publisher=BBC News| date = 17 October 2000 | accessdate =17 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Sinn Féin denied the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = IRA denies murdering dissident | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/977201.stm |publisher=BBC News| date = 18 October 2000 | accessdate =17 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; No-one has been charged with his killing.

The IRA was responsible for more deaths than any other organisation during the Troubles.&lt;ref&gt;Richard English (2003), ''Armed Struggle – The History of the IRA'', p.378&lt;/ref&gt; Two detailed studies of deaths in the Troubles, the [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN), and the book ''Lost Lives'',&lt;ref&gt;''Lost Lives'' (2004. Ed's David McKitrick, Seamus Kelters, Brian Feeney, Chris Thornton, David McVea)&lt;/ref&gt; differ slightly on the numbers killed by the IRA and the total number of conflict deaths. According to CAIN, the IRA was responsible for at least 1,707 deaths, about 48% of the total conflict deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/tables/Organisation_Responsible.html |title=Sutton Index of Deaths: Organisation responsible for the death |publisher=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN) |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, at least 1,009 (about 59%) were members or former members of the British security forces, while at least 508 (about 29%) were civilians.&lt;ref name=cain-crosstabs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/crosstabs.html|title=Sutton Index of Deaths: Crosstabulations (two-way tables)|publisher=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN)|accessdate=1 March 2016}} (choose "organization" and "status summary" as the variables)&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Lost Lives'' (2006 edition), the IRA was responsible for 1,768 deaths, about 47% of the total conflict deaths. Of these, 934 (about 52%) were members of the British security forces, while 639 (about 36%) were civilians (including 61 former members of the security forces).&lt;ref name=lostlives-stats&gt;[[David McKittrick]] et al. ''Lost Lives: The Stories of the Men, Women and Children who Died as a Result of the Northern Ireland Troubles''. Random House, 2006. pp. 1551-55&lt;/ref&gt; The civilian figure also includes civilians employed by British forces, politicians, members of the judiciary, and alleged criminals and [[informant|informers]]. Most of the remainder were loyalist or republican paramilitary members; including over 100 IRA members accidentally killed by their own bombs or shot for being security force agents or informers. Overall, the IRA was responsible for 87–90% of the total British security force deaths, and 27–30% of the total civilian deaths in the conflict.&lt;ref name=cain-crosstabs/&gt;&lt;ref name=lostlives-stats/&gt;

A little under 300 IRA members were killed in the Troubles.&lt;ref&gt;Lost Lives, p. 1531.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, roughly 50–60 members of [[Sinn Féin]] were killed.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Long War, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many more IRA volunteers were imprisoned than killed. Journalists Eamonn Mallie and Patrick Bishop estimate in their book ''The Provisional IRA'' that roughly 8,000 people passed through the ranks of the IRA in the first 20 years of its existence, many of them leaving after arrest (senior officers are required to surrender their post after being arrested), retiring from the armed campaign or "disillusionment". They give 10,000 as the total number of past and present IRA members at that time.&lt;ref name="Mallie, Bishop p12"&gt;Mallie, Bishop, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinn Féin is widely regarded as the political wing of the IRA, but the party insists that the two organisations are separate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

American media tended to describe the Provisional IRA as "activists" and "guerillas", while the British counterpart commonly used the term "terrorists", particularly the BBC as part of its official guidelines, published in 1989.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3Hy7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=%22American+media%22+described+guerrillas+IRA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22American%20media%22%20described%20guerrillas%20IRA&amp;f=false|title=Controlling Broadcasting: Access Policy and Practice in North America and Europe|last=Aldridge|first=Meryl|last2=Hewitt|first2=Nicholas|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0719042775|location=|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Mandelson]], a former [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], contrasted the post-1997 activities of the IRA with those of [[Al-Qaeda]], describing the latter as "terrorists" and the former as "freedom fighters" (though Mandelson subsequently denied this sentiment).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = MP denies 'IRA freedom fighters' claim | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1734383.stm |publisher=BBC News| date = 30 December 2001 | accessdate =24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRA prefer the terms [[freedom fighter]], soldier, [[Activism|activist]], or [[Volunteer (Irish republican)|volunteer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Critical Terrorism Studies: A New Research Agenda'' by Richard Jackson, Marie Breen Smyth and Jeroen Gunning ({{ISBN|978-0415455077}}), page 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Terrorists and Freedom Fighters (People, politics and powers)'' by David Hayes ({{ISBN|978-0853406525}}), page 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Terrorism, Ideology, and Revolution/the Origins of Modern Political Violence'' by Noel O'Sullivan ({{ISBN|978-0813303451}}), page 104&lt;/ref&gt; The [[US Department of State]] lists them in the category 'other selected terrorist groups also deemed of

The IRA described its actions throughout "The Troubles" as a military campaign waged against the British Army, the RUC, other security forces, judiciary, loyalist politicians and loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland, England and Europe. The IRA considers these groups to be all part of the same apparatus. As noted above, the IRA seeks to draw a direct descendancy from the original IRA and those who engaged in the [[Irish War of Independence]]. The IRA sees the previous conflict as a [[guerrilla war]] which accomplished some of its aims, with some remaining "unfinished business".&lt;ref&gt;Gerry Adam's 2006 Easter Message was that "unfinished business" remains, available here [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/sf/ga160406.htm]. "But in truth The Proclamation is also unfinished business. It is unfinished business which the vast majority of the Irish people want to see brought to completion."&lt;/ref&gt;

A process called "Criminalisation" was begun in the mid-1970s as part of a British strategy of "Criminalisation, Ulsterisation, and Normalisation". The policy was outlined in a 1975 British strategy paper titled "The Way Ahead", which was not published but was referred to by Labour's first Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Merlyn Rees, and came to be the dominant British political theme in the conflict as it raged into the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Another categorisation avoids the terms "guerrilla" or "terrorist" but does view the conflict in military terms. The phrase originated with the British military strategist [[Frank Kitson]] who was active in Northern Ireland during the early 1970s. In Kitson's view, the violence of the IRA represented an "insurrection", with the enveloping atmosphere of belligerence representing a "[[low intensity conflict]]" – a conflict where the forces involved in fighting operate at a greatly reduced tempo, with fewer combatants, at a reduced range of tactical equipment and limited scope to operate in a military manner.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Membership of the IRA remains illegal in both the UK and the Republic of Ireland, but IRA prisoners convicted of offences committed before 1998 have been granted conditional early release as part of the [[Good Friday Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://centreforforeignpolicystudies.dal.ca/pdf/gradsymp11/Vocisano.pdf Transitional Justice in Northern Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/67zkZiNwE?url=http://centreforforeignpolicystudies.dal.ca/pdf/gradsymp11/Vocisano.pdf |date=28 May 2012 }} Submitted for the 6th Annual Dalhousie University Graduate Symposium, 10 and 11 March 2011 in Halifax, Nova Scotia&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom a person convicted of membership of a "proscribed organisation", such as the IRA, still nominally faces imprisonment for up to 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = House of Commons Hansard Debates for 30&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;2002 (pt 8) | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo021030/debtext/21030-08.htm | publisher = House of Commons | date = 30 October 2002 | accessdate =17 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strength and support==

===Numerical strength===
It is unclear how many people joined the IRA during the troubles, however in the early to mid-1970s, the numbers recruited by the IRA may have reached several thousand. Official membership reduction coincided with the adoption by the IRA in 1979 of a 'cell structure' in an attempt to counter security force penetration through the use of informers.&lt;ref name="cain.ulst.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/violence/paramilitary2.htm|title=CAIN: Issues: Violence – Paramilitary Groups, Membership and Arsenals|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|publisher=Conflict Archive on the Internet}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to members in Ireland the IRA also had one or two 'active service units' in Britain and mainland Europe.&lt;ref name="cain.ulst.ac.uk"/&gt;

An [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] report of 1986 estimated that the IRA had 300 or so members in Active Service Units and up to 750 active members in total in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="O'Brien, p. 161"/&gt; This does not take into consideration the IRA units in the Republic of Ireland or those in Britain, continental Europe, and throughout the world. In 2005, the then [[Minister for Justice and Equality|Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform]], [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]] told the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] that the organisation had "between 1,000 and 1,500" active members.&lt;ref name="debates.oireachtas.ie"&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20050623.xml&amp;Node=H10-1#H10-1 Parliamentary Debates (Official Report – Unrevised) Dáil Éireann Thursday, 23 June 2005 – Page 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217045724/http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20050623.xml&amp;Node=H10-1 |date=17 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the book ''The Provisional IRA'' (by Eamon Mallie and Patrick Bishop), roughly 8,000 people passed through the ranks of the IRA in the first 20 years of its existence, many of them leaving after arrest, "retirement" or disillusionment.&lt;ref name="Mallie, Bishop p12"/&gt; In later years, the IRA's strength has been somewhat weakened by members leaving the organisation to join hardline splinter groups such as the [[Continuity IRA]] and the [[Real IRA]]. According to former Irish Minister for Justice Michael McDowell, these organisations have little more than 150 members each.&lt;ref name="debates.oireachtas.ie"/&gt;

According to Sinn Féin MLA [[Gerry Kelly]] speaking in an interview with Rowan Hand in October 2013 he said about 30,000 members passed through the ranks of the IRA between 1969 and 1997 with most leaving after a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opZuQbCv7Fg|title=MLA Gerry Kelly – 10th October 2013|first=|last=Vadio IE|date=26 June 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electoral and popular support===
Popular support for the IRA's campaign in the Troubles is hard to gauge, given that Sinn Féin, the IRA's political wing, did not stand in elections until the early 1980s. Most nationalists in Northern Ireland voted for the moderate [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) until 2001. After the [[1981 Irish hunger strike|1981 hunger strike]], Sinn Féin mobilised large electoral support and won 105,000 votes, or 43% of the nationalist vote in Northern Ireland, in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 UK general election]], only 34,000 votes behind the SDLP.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]], the SDLP won 184,445 votes and four seats to Sinn Féin's 78,291 votes and no seats.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Northern Ireland local elections, 1993|1993 Local District Council Elections in Northern Ireland]], the SDLP won 136,760 votes to Sinn Féin's 77,600 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/flg93.htm|title=Local Government Elections 1993|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few Protestant voters voted for Sinn Féin. In 1992, many of them voted for SDLP [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|West Belfast]] candidate [[Joe Hendron]] rather than a [[unionist (Ireland)|unionist]] candidate to make sure Gerry Adams of Sinn Féin lost his seat in the constituency.&lt;ref&gt;(Coogan p284)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Coalisland.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An IRA wall mural in Coalisland, County Tyrone]]

The IRA enjoyed some popular support in the Republic of Ireland in the early 1970s. However, the movement's appeal was hurt badly by bombings such as the killing of civilians attending a [[Remembrance Day massacre|Remembrance Day]] ceremony at the [[cenotaph]] in [[Enniskillen]] in 1987 ([[Remembrance Day bombing]]), and the [[Warrington bomb attacks|death of two children]] when a bomb exploded in [[Warrington]], which led to tens of thousands of people demonstrating on [[O'Connell Street]] in Dublin to call for an end to the IRA's campaign. In the [[1987 Irish General Election]], they won only 1.7% of the votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; They did not make significant electoral gains in the Republic until after the IRA ceasefires and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. By the [[Irish general election, 2011|2011 Irish general election]] Sinn Féin's proportion of the popular vote had reached 9.9 percent.

Sinn Féin now has 29 members of the Northern Ireland Assembly (out of 108), 7 [[British House of Commons|Westminster]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MPs]] (out of 18 from Northern Ireland) and 23 Republic of Ireland [[Teachta Dála|TDs]] (out of 166).

===Support from other countries and organisations===
{{See also|Provisional IRA arms importation|NORAID}}
The IRA have had contacts with foreign governments and other illegal armed organisations.

Libya had been the biggest single supplier of arms and funds to the IRA, donating large amounts: three shipments of arms in the early 1970s and another three in the mid-1980s, the latter reputedly enough to arm two regular infantry battalions.&lt;ref name="Bowyer Bell 1997 pp. 556" /&gt;

The IRA has also received weapons and logistical support from [[Irish Americans]] in the United States. Apart from the Libyan aid, this has been the main source of overseas IRA support. American support has been weakened by the "[[War on Terror]]", and the fallout from the [[11 September 2001 attacks|events of 11 September 2001]].&lt;ref name="John O'Sullivan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="John Lloyd" /&gt;

In the United States in November 1982, five men were acquitted of smuggling arms to the IRA after they claimed the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) had approved the shipment, although the CIA denied this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = A Chronology of the Conflict – 1982 | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch82.htm |publisher=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] | accessdate =17 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are allegations of contact with the East German [[Stasi]], based on the testimony of a Soviet defector to British intelligence [[Vasili Mitrokhin]]. Mitrokhin revealed that although the Soviet [[KGB]] gave some weapons to the Marxist [[Official IRA]], it had little sympathy with the Provisionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Mitrokhin | first = Vasili | authorlink = Vasili Mitrokhin | title = The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB | publisher = [[Basic Books]] |year=2000 | page = 384 | isbn = 978-0-465-00312-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There was tight contact between the IRA and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) and specifically the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) starting from the mid-1970s which included the intensive training of IRA volunteers. In 1977, the Provisionals received a 'sizeable' arms shipment from the PLO, including arms, rocket launchers and explosives, but this was intercepted at [[Antwerp]] after the Israeli intelligence alerted its European counterparts. Afterwards, they declined on the grounds that it was impossible to smuggle arms out of the [[Levant|Levant region]] without alerting Israeli intelligence. Tim Pat Coogan wrote that assistance from the PLO has dried up in the late-1980s after the PLO had forged stronger links with the government of the Republic of Ireland.
&lt;ref&gt;Mallie, Bishop, the Provisional IRA, p 307&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mir Ali Montazam, one-time first secretary at the Iranian embassy, [[Iran]] played a key part in funding the IRA during the 1980s. Iranian officials deposited £4 million into a secret [[Jersey]] bank account, funded by the sale of artwork from the [[Iranian Embassy in London]]. [[Hadi Ghaffari]], the "machinegun mullah", was sent to Belfast and organised the distribution of the money via sympathetic Irish businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;''Iran paid millions to fund IRA'' Adrian Levy and Anna Pukas. [[The Times]], 21 August 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Falls Road, west Belfast 1981.jpg|thumbnail|Falls Road in 1981]]
It has been alleged that the IRA had a co-operative relationship with Basque militant group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] since the early 1970s. In 1973 it was accused of providing explosives for the assassination of [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1973-12-27-04-013&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1973-12-27-04 |work=The Times |location=London | title=IRA provided explosives for Madrid assassination | date=27 December 1973 | accessdate=22 May 2010 | first=Fiona | last=Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, ETA also exchanged a quantity of handguns for training in explosives with the IRA.&lt;ref&gt;Mallie, Bishop, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the leaders of the political wings of the respective Irish republican and Basque separatist movements have exchanged visits on several occasions to express solidarity with each other's cause.&lt;ref&gt;for example http://www.anphoblacht.com/news/detail/17845&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent former IRA prisoners such as [[Brendan McFarlane]] and [[Brendan Hughes]] have campaigned for the release of ETA prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noticiasdegipuzkoa.com/ediciones/2006/06/17/politica/euskadi/d17eus17.225155.php |title=Las excarcelaciones provocaron momentos difíciles para las víctimas, pero prevaleció la paz |accessdate=11 June 2008 |date=17 June 2006 |website=NOTICIAS DE GIPUZKOA |language=Spanish }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Basque bombers top up IRA's terror arsenal | author = David Bamber | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/06/30/nira30.xml |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London | date = 4 March 2000 | accessdate =27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1990s after the IRA ceasefire, Basque media outlets followed the process carefully, sending a team to follow the families of those killed on Bloody Sunday as they campaigned for apology.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In May 1996, the [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB), Russia's internal security service, publicly accused [[Estonia]] of arms smuggling, and claimed that the IRA had contacted representatives of Estonia's volunteer defence force, [[Kaitseliit]], and some non-government groups to buy weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Russia Reform Monitor No. 137 | author = J.

The US House of Representatives Committee on International Relations in its report of 24 April 2002 concluded "Neither committee investigators nor the Colombians can find credible explanations for the increased, more sophisticated capacity for these specific terror tactics now being employed by the FARC, other than IRA training".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives House International Relations Committee |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.house.gov/archives/107/findings.htm |date=24 April 2002 |accessdate=17 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228212525/http://www.foreignaffairs.house.gov/archives/107/findings.htm |archivedate=28 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013 the report of the [[Smithwick Tribunal]] concluded that "on the balance of probability" collusion took place between the IRA and members of the [[Garda Síochána]] in the 1989 [[1989 Jonesborough ambush|killing of two RUC officers]]; however, the report could not conclusively prove this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/04/ireland-pm-ira-garda-murders-ruc-shocking-enda-kenny|title=Ireland PM: IRA-Garda collusion in murders of RUC officers is 'shocking'|first=Henry McDonald Ireland|last=correspondent|date=4 December 2013|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informers==
Throughout the Troubles, some members of the IRA passed information to the security forces. Members of the IRA suspected of being informants were usually killed. In the 1980s, many more IRA members were imprisoned on the testimony of former IRA members known as "[[Supergrass (informer)|supergrasses]]" such as [[Raymond Gilmour]]. A Belfast newspaper has claimed that secret documents show that half of the IRA's top men were also British informers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/half-of-all-top-ira-men-worked-for-security-services-16093721.html| title=Half of all top IRA men 'worked for security services'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been some high-profile allegations of senior IRA figures having been British informers. In May 2003, a number of newspapers named [[Freddie Scappaticci]] as the alleged identity of the British [[Force Research Unit]]'s most senior informer within the IRA, code-named ''[[Stakeknife]]'', who is thought to have been head of the IRA's internal security force, charged with rooting out and executing informers. Scappaticci denies that this is the case and, in 2003, failed in a legal bid to force the then NIO Minister, [[Jane Kennedy (politician)|Jane Kennedy]], to state he was not an informer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = 'Stakeknife' loses bid to quash spy claim | author = Ted Oliver | url = https://www.theguardian.com/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,,1021579,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London | date = 19 August 2003 | accessdate =17 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has refused to do so, and since then Scappaticci has not launched any libel actions against the media making the allegations.

On 16 December 2005, senior Sinn Féin member [[Denis Donaldson]] appeared before TV cameras in Dublin and confessed to being a British spy for twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Sinn Féin man admits he was agent | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4536826.stm |publisher=BBC News| date = 16 December 2005 | accessdate =26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was expelled from Sinn Féin and was said to have been debriefed by the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Denis Donaldson&amp;nbsp;– squalid living after a life of lies | author = Suzanne Breen | url = http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/Sunday_Tribune/arts2006/mar26_Donaldson_squalid_life__SBreen.php |website=[[Sunday Tribune]] | date = 26 March 2006 | accessdate =26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donaldson was a former IRA volunteer and subsequently highly placed Sinn Féin party member. Donaldson had been entrusted by Gerry Adams with the running of Sinn Féin's operations in the US in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = No tears over Denis Donaldson | author = Suzanne Breen | url = http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/Sunday_Tribune/arts2006/apr9_no_tears_Donaldson__SBreen.php |website=Sunday Tribune | date = 9 April 2006 | accessdate =26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 April 2006, Donaldson was found shot dead at his retreat near [[Glenties]] in [[County Donegal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Sinn Féin British agent shot dead | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4877516.stm |publisher=BBC News| date = 4 April 2006 | accessdate =26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked whether he felt Donaldson's role as an informer in Sinn Féin was significant, the IRA double agent using the pseudonym "[[Kevin Fulton]]" described Donaldson's role as a spy within Sinn Féin as "the tip of the iceberg".&lt;ref&gt;"Kevin Fulton" (not his real name) made the comments on a BBC News 24 interview 10 April 2006, RealMedia available here [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/4896772.stm] or available on googlevideo here [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6059990750930681049&amp;q=kevin+fulton] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111221030/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/4896772.stm|date=11 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Real IRA claimed responsibility for his assassination on 12 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2009/apr/12/how-real-ira-killed-denis-donaldson/ Real IRA killed Dennis Donaldson] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214230959/http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2009/apr/12/how-real-ira-killed-denis-donaldson/ |date=14 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 February 2008, Roy McShane was taken into police protection after being unmasked as an [[informant]]. McShane, a former IRA member, had been Gerry Adams' personal driver for many years. Adams said he was "too philosophical" to feel betrayed.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Irish Times]]'', 11 February 2008, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public consultation''', or simply '''consultation''', is a regulatory process by which the public's input on matters affecting them is sought. Its main goals are in improving the efficiency, transparency&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/4/43/36785341.pdf Background Document on Public Consultation] (from the [[OECD]] Code, 10-Mar-2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and public involvement in large-scale projects or laws and policies. It usually involves ''notification'' (to publicise the matter to be consulted on), ''consultation'' (a two-way flow of information and opinion exchange) as well as ''participation'' (involving interest groups in the drafting of policy or legislation).&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; A frequently used tool for understanding different levels of community participation in consultation is known as [[Arnstein's ladder]].

The process is typical of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shannon|first=Moneo|title=Everyone Has An Opinion: The Art of Community Consultation|url=http://cityspaces.ca/art-community-consultation/|accessdate=April 8, 2014|newspaper=Douglas Magazine|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand]] or [[Australia]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} though most [[democracy|democratic]] countries have similar systems. In the [[United States]], for example, this process is called "public notice and comment" (see [[Rulemaking]]). Some organisations such as the [[OECD]] also use such processes.&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; In Canada, the word "consultation" has a special meaning among some First Nations Groups: "it is the duty of the Crown and third parties to consult with First Nations who have asserted, but not proved, [[Indigenous peoples#Indigenous rights, issues and concerns|aboriginal rights]] or title."&lt;ref&gt;Billy Garton and Sandra Carter, "First Nations Consultation: Higher, Wider, Deeper and Sooner", Bull, Housser &amp; Tupper, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is great variation of public consultations. In some countries there is a list of all consultations, or consultations are mentioned in normal news feed. Depending on the country there can be national or regional public consultations.

Ineffective consultations are considered to be cosmetic consultations that were done due to obligation or show and not true participatory decision making.

In 1991, he became part of the defense lawyer team defending the case of the arrested leaders of the [[Islamic Salvation Front]], [[Abbassi Madani]] and [[Ali Belhadj]]. On 31 July 1996, he was abducted at gunpoint from his car by four assailants who turned out to be members of the security forces. He was then detained secretly for over a week, repeatedly beaten and threatened with death,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport.php?id=C31D660257EB53E080256A0F005BEA9E&amp;c=DZA |title=AI REPORT 1997: ALGERIA |access-date=2007-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714003231/http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport.php?id=C31D660257EB53E080256A0F005BEA9E&amp;c=DZA |archive-date=2007-07-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually charged with belonging to a terrorist group.  In July 1997, he was acquitted of this charge and instead convicted of having "encouraged terrorism", a charge that had not been brought against him in the trial and against which he had no opportunity to defend himself. [[Amnesty International]] said the trial had "clearly violated international standards for fair trial".&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/appeals/index/dza-010998-wwa-eng ALGERIA: Rachid Mesli - update] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20041031232806/http://web.amnesty.org/appeals/index/dza-010998-wwa-eng |date=2004-10-31 }}, Amnesty International Sept. 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1998, his conviction was quashed by the Supreme Court; he was kept in prison while awaiting retrial, contrary to Algerian law.  In June 1999, he was found guilty of belonging to a terrorist group and sentenced to three years' imprisonment.  He was released in July 1999, one and a half weeks before his sentence was to end, as part of a presidential pardon.  In 2000, fearing for his and his family's safety, he left the country to live in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algeria-watch.org/en/hr/torture/ai_facouli.htm Torture of Tahar Facouli], Amnesty International Index: MDE 28/021/2002 16 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Since moving to Geneva, he has continued his human rights activism.  In 2001, he co-founded [[Justitia Universalis]], a non-governmental organisation dedicated to fighting impunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justitia-universalis.net/go_en/?About_us:Presentation Justitia Universalis - Presentation]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, he submitted the cases of [[Abbassi Madani]] and [[Ali Belhadj]], the detained leaders of the banned [[Islamic Salvation Front]], to the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in Geneva, which ruled that both were being detained arbitrarily, since their 1992 trial had failed to comply with international standards.  This verdict greatly displeased the Algerian government, which subsequently charged Rachid Mesli with belonging to an "armed terrorist group" operating abroad, issuing an unenforceable arrest warrant. According to [[Amnesty International]], several Algerians ([[Tahar Facouli]], [[Brahim Ladada]], and [[Abdelkrim Khider]]) have been arrested and tortured mainly for being in contact with him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engMDE280202002?OpenDocument&amp;of=COUNTRIES%5CALGERIA  Appeal Case - Algeria: Torture of Brahim Ladada and Abdelkrim Khider]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Amnesty International 14 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, he co-founded [[Rachad]], an organisation dedicated to overthrowing the Algerian government through mass nonviolent resistance.

{{Segregation}}
{{Discrimination sidebar}}

'''Racial segregation''' is the separation of people into [[race (human classification)|racial]] or other [[Ethnicity|ethnic groups]] in daily life. It may apply to activities such as eating in a restaurant, drinking from a water fountain, using a public toilet, attending school, going to the movies, riding on a bus, or in the rental or purchase of a home&lt;ref&gt;''Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium'', Michael Schill &amp; Susan Wachter, [[Cityscape]]&lt;/ref&gt; or of hotel rooms. Segregation is defined by the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] as "the act by which a (natural or legal) person separates other persons on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds without an objective and reasonable justification, in conformity with the proposed definition of discrimination. As a result, the voluntary act of separating oneself from other people on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds does not constitute segregation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/activities/GPR/EN/Recommendation_N7/Recommendation_7_en.asp ECRI General Policy Recommendation N°7: National legislation to combat racism and racial discrimination] — Explanatory memorandum, Para. 16&lt;/ref&gt; According to the UN Forum on Minority Issues, "The creation and development of classes and schools providing education in minority languages should not be considered impermissible segregation, if the assignment to such classes and schools is of a voluntary nature".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/10session/A.HRC.10.11.Add.1.pdf Recommendations of the Forum on Minority Issues A/HRC/10/11/Add.1] — para. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial segregation is generally outlawed, but may exist ''[[de facto]]'' through social norms, even when there is no strong individual preference for it, as suggested by [[Thomas Schelling]]'s models of segregation and subsequent work.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas C. Schelling (1969) "Models of segregation", ''American Economic Review'', 1969, 59(2), [http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic185351.files/shelling1.pdf 488–493].&lt;/ref&gt;  Segregation may be maintained by means ranging from discrimination in hiring and in the rental and sale of housing to certain races to [[vigilante]] violence (such as [[lynching]]s). Generally, a situation that arises when members of different races mutually prefer to associate and do business with members of their own race would usually be described as ''separation'' or ''[[de facto]] separation'' of the races rather than ''segregation''. In the United States, segregation was mandated by law in some states and came with [[anti-miscegenation laws]] (prohibitions against [[interracial marriage]]).&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Virginia [[Racial Integrity Act]], Virginia Code § 20–58 and § 20–59&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation, however, often allowed close contact in [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]] situations, such as allowing a person of one race to work as a servant for a member of another race. Segregation can involve [[wikt:spatial|spatial]] separation of the races, and mandatory use of different institutions, such as schools and hospitals by people of different races.

== History==
Wherever there have been multiracial communities, there has been racial segregation. Only areas with extensive [[miscegenation]], or mixing, such as Hawaii and Brazil, despite some social stratification, seem to be exempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/488135/racial-segregation Racial segregation]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Algeria===
Following its conquest of [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] controlled [[Algeria]] in 1830, for well over a century France maintained [[French colonial empires|colonial rule]] in the territory which has been described as "quasi-[[apartheid]]".&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;"Algeria was in fact a colony but constitutionally was a part of France and not thought of in the 1950s (even by many on the left) as a colony. It was a society of nine million or so 'Muslim' Algerians who were dominated by the million settlers of diverse origins (but fiercely French) who maintained a quasi-apartheid regime." Bell, David Scott. ''Presidential Power in Fifth Republic France'', Berg Publishers, 2000, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The colonial law of 1865 allowed Arab and Berber Algerians to apply for French citizenship only if they abandoned their Muslim identity; Azzedine Haddour argues that this established "the formal structures of a political apartheid".&lt;ref&gt;"[the] ''senatus-consulte'' of 1865 stipulated that all the colonised indigenous were under French jurisdiction, i.e., French nationals subjected to French laws, but it restricted citizenship only to those who renounced their Muslim religion and culture. There was an obvious split in French legal discourse: a split between nationality and citizenship which established the formal structures of a political apartheid encouraging the existence of 'French subjects' disenfranchised, without any rights to citizenship, treated as objects of French law and not citizens". Debra Kelly. ''Autobiography And Independence: Selfhood and Creativity in North African Postcolonial Writing in French'', Liverpool University Press, 2005, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Camille Bonora-Waisman writes that, "[i]n contrast with the Moroccan and Tunisian protectorates", this "colonial apartheid society" was unique to Algeria.&lt;ref name=Bonora-Waisman&gt;"In contrast with the Moroccan and Tunisian protectorates, Algeria was made an integral part of France and became a colony of settlement for more than one million Europeans... under colonial rule, Algerians encountered France's 'civilising mission' only through the plundering of lands and colonial apartheid society..." Bonora-Waisman, Camille. ''France and the Algerian Conflict: Issues in Democracy and Political Stability, 1988–1995'', Ashgate Publishing, 2003, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

This "internal system of apartheid" met with considerable resistance from the Muslims affected by it, and is cited as one of the causes of the [[Algerian War|1954 insurrection]] and ensuing independence war.&lt;ref name=Wall&gt;"As a settler colony with an internal system of apartheid, administered under the fiction that it was part of metropolitan France, and endowed with a powerful colonial lobby that virtually determined the course of French politics with respect to its internal affairs, it experienced insurrection in 1954 on the part of its Muslim population." Wall, Irwin M. ''France, the United States, and the Algerian War'', University of California Press, 2001, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fifteenth-century north-east Germany, people of [[Wends|Wend]]ish, i.e. [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]], origin were not allowed to join some [[guild]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ifl-leipzig.com/fileadmin/daten/downloads/DOWNLOADCENTER/Publikationen/internationale%20Zusammenfassungen%20Europa%20Regional/2002/Heft2/en.pdf The Situation with the Sorbs in the Past and Present] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713003632/http://www.ifl-leipzig.com/fileadmin/daten/downloads/DOWNLOADCENTER/Publikationen/internationale%20Zusammenfassungen%20Europa%20Regional/2002/Heft2/en.pdf |date=13 July 2011 }}" (pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilhelm Raabe, "down into the eighteenth century no German guild accepted a Wend."&lt;ref&gt;Raabe, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

German praise for America's institutional racism, previously found in Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'', was continuous throughout the early 1930s, and radical Nazi lawyers were advocates of the use of American models.&lt;ref name="Whitman"/&gt; Race based U.S. citizenship laws and [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|anti-miscegenation laws]] directly inspired the two principal [[Nuremberg Laws]]—the Citizenship Law and the Blood Law.&lt;ref name="Whitman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Q. Whitman|first1=James|title=Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law|date=2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=37–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban on interracial marriage (anti-miscegenation) prohibited sexual relations and marriages between people classified as "Aryan" and "non-Aryan." Such relationships were called ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (race defilement). At first the laws were aimed primarily at Jews but were later extended to "Gypsies, Negroes and their bastard offspring".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = S. H.

Rupp]], ''Mobilizing Women for War'', p 125, {{ISBN|0-691-04649-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; To preserve the so-called purity of the German blood, after the war began, the Nazis extended the race defilement law to include all foreigners (non-Germans).&lt;ref name="Majer2003"&gt;{{cite book|author = Diemut Majer | title = "Non-Germans" Under the Third Reich: The Nazi Judicial and Administrative System in Germany and Occupied Eastern Europe with Special Regard to Occupied Poland, 1939–1945 | year = 2003|publisher = JHU Press | isbn=978-0-8018-6493-3 | page = 180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the General Government of occupied [[Poland]] in 1940, the Nazis divided the population into different groups, each with different rights, food rations, allowed housing strips in the cities, public transportation, etc. In an effort to split Polish identity they attempted to establish ethnic divisions of [[Kashubians]] and [[Gorals]] ([[Goralenvolk]]), based on these groups' alleged "Germanic component."

During the 1930s and 1940s, Jews in Nazi-controlled states were made to wear yellow ribbons or stars of David, and were, along with [[Romani people|Romas]] (Gypsies), discriminated against by the racial laws. Jewish doctors were not allowed to treat Aryan patients nor were Jewish professors permitted to teach Aryan pupils. In addition, Jews were not allowed to use any public transportation, besides the ferry, and were able to shop only from 3–5 pm in Jewish stores. After ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' ("The Night of Broken Glass"), the Jews were fined 1,000,000 [[German reichsmark|marks]] for damages done by the Nazi troops and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members.

[[File:Lwow Ghetto (spring 1942).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Women behind the barbed wire fence of the [[Lvov Ghetto]] in occupied Poland. Spring 1942]]

Jews and Roma were subjected to [[genocide]] as "undesirable" racial groups in the [[Holocaust]]. The Nazis established [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939–1944|ghettos]] to confine Jews and sometimes Romas into tightly packed areas of the cities of Eastern Europe, turning them into ''de facto'' [[concentration camp]]s. The [[Warsaw Ghetto]] was the largest of these ghettos, with 400,000 people. The [[Łódź Ghetto]] was the second largest, holding about 160,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fcit.usf.edu/HOLOCAUST/timeline/ghettos.htm |title=Holocaust Timeline: The Ghettos |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date=23 November 1939 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;



Between 1939 and 1945, at least 1.5 million [[Poland|Polish]] citizens were transported to the Reich for [[forced labour]] (in all, about 12 million forced laborers were employed in the German war economy inside [[Nazi Germany]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Marek (nda) |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1757323,00.html |title=Final Compensation Pending for Former Nazi Forced Laborers |publisher=Dw-world.de |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |title=Forced Labor at Ford Werke AG during the Second World War |publisher=Summeroftruth.org |accessdate=18 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014235036/http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |archivedate=14 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Nazi Germany also used forced laborers from Western Europe, [[Poles]], along with other Eastern Europeans viewed as racially inferior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |title=Hitler's Plans |publisher=Dac.neu.edu |accessdate=5 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401234751/http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |archivedate=1 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  were subject to deeper discriminatory measures. They were forced to wear a yellow with purple border and letter "[[P (symbol)|P]]" (for Polen/Polish) cloth identifying tag sewn to their clothing, subjected to a [[curfew]], and banned from [[public transportation]].

While the treatment of factory workers or farm hands often varied depending on the individual employer, Polish laborers as a rule were compelled to work longer hours for lower wages than Western Europeans – in many cities, they were forced to live in segregated barracks behind barbed wire. Social relations with [[Germans]] outside work were forbidden, and sexual relations (''[[Rassenschande]]'' or "racial defilement") were punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaust-trc.org/poles.htm |title=Poles: Victims of the Nazi Era |publisher=Holocaust-trc.org |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial China===
====Tang dynasty====
Several laws enforcing racial segregation of foreigners from Chinese were passed by the [[Han chinese]] during the [[Tang dynasty]]. In 779 the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced [[Uyghur people|Uighurs]] to wear their ethnic dress, stopped them from marrying Chinese females, and banned them from pretending to be Chinese. Chinese disliked Uighurs because they practiced [[usury]]. The magistrate who issued the orders may have wanted to protect "purity" in Chinese custom. In 836, when Lu Chun was appointed as governor of Canton, he was disgusted to find Chinese living with foreigners and intermarriage between Chinese and foreigners. Lu enforced separation, banning interracial marriages, and made it illegal for foreigners to own property.

====Qing dynasty====
{{main article|Eight Banners}}
The [[Qing Dynasty]] was founded not by the Han Chinese who form the majority of the Chinese population, but the Manchus, who are today an ethnic minority of China. The [[Manchu people|Manchus]] were keenly aware of their minority status, however, it was only later in the dynasty that they banned intermarriage.

Han defectors played a massive role in the Qing conquest of China. Han Chinese Generals who defected to the Manchu were often [[Heqin#Qing dynasty|given women from the Imperial Aisin Gioro family in marriage]] while the ordinary soldiers who defected were given non-royal Manchu women as wives. The Manchu leader [[Nurhaci]] married one of his granddaughters to the Ming General [[Li Yongfang]] after he surrendered [[Fushun]] in [[Liaoning]] to the Manchu in 1618.&lt;ref name="ed.

A mass marriage of Han Chinese officers and officials to Manchu women numbering 1,000 couples was arranged by Prince Yoto and [[Hongtaiji]] in 1632 to promote harmony between the two ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="ed. Walthall 2008"/&gt;

Geng Zhongming, a Han bannerman, was awarded the title of Prince Jingnan, and his son Geng Jingmao managed to have both his sons Geng Jingzhong and Geng Zhaozhong become court attendants under Shunzhi and get married to Aisin Gioro women, with Haoge's (a son of Hong Taiji) daughter marrying Geng Jingzhong and Prince Abatai's (Hong Taiji) granddaughter marrying Geng Zhaozhong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&amp;pg=PA1017#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China|first=FREDERIC WAKEMAN|last=JR|date=1 January 1985|publisher=University of California Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qing differentiated between Han Bannermen and ordinary Han civilians. Han Bannermen were made out of Han Chinese who defected to the Qing up to 1644 and joined the Eight Banners, giving them social and legal privileges in addition to being acculturated to Manchu culture. So many Han defected to the Qing and swelled up the ranks of the Eight Banners that ethnic Manchus became a minority within the Banners, making up only 16% in 1648, with Han Bannermen dominating at 75%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cpfgQNWXpyoC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=16+percent+manchu+bannermen+1648&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XV-XVKWhDcm_ggSs2oPQBw&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=16%20percent%20manchu%20bannermen%201648&amp;f=false Naquin 1987], p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sZt0TgTAgPoC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=16+percent+manchu+bannermen+1648&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XV-XVKWhDcm_ggSs2oPQBw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=16%20percent%20manchu%20bannermen%201648&amp;f=false Fairbank, Goldman 2006], p. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/inaasim/Mingqing04/Qing3.htm|title=Summing up Naquin/Rawski|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this multi-ethnic force in which Manchus were only a minority, which conquered China for the Qing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gAIcwz3V_JsC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=The+conquest+of+China+was+achieved+by+these+combined+banner+forces,+in+which+less+than+16+percent+of+the+soldiers+by+1648+were+actually+of+Manchu+origin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7l-XVJnbGIe-ggT4oYGIDQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20conquest%20of%20China%20was%20achieved%20by%20these%20combined%20banner%20forces%2C%20in%20which%20less%20than%2016%20percent%20of%20the%20soldiers%20by%201648%20were%20actually%20of%20Manchu%20origin&amp;f=false eds.

It was Han Chinese Bannermen who were responsible for the successful Qing conquest of China, they made up the majority of governors in the early Qing and were the ones who governed and administered China after the conquest, stabilizing Qing rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vI1RRslLNSwC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=fifteen+governors+chinese+manchus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nEwFVN_IHtOxggSco4LwDQ&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=fifteen%20governors%20chinese%20manchus&amp;f=false Spencer 1990], p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Han Bannermen dominated the post of governor-general in the time of the Shunzhi and Kangxi Emperors, and also the post of governors, largely excluding ordinary Han civilians from the posts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rXiSxh1oGe0C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=fifteen+governors+chinese+manchus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WksFVJPAAcPGggSk4oHAAw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=fifteen%20governors%20chinese%20manchus&amp;f=false Spence 1988], pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

To promote ethnic harmony, a 1648 decree from the Manchu [[Shunzhi Emperor]] allowed Han Chinese civilian men to marry Manchu women from the Banners with the permission of the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners, it was only later in the dynasty that these policies allowing intermarriage were done away with.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140111230216/http://www.chss.iup.edu/chr/CHR-2004Fall-11-WANG-research%20notes-final.pdf Wang 2004, pp. 215–216 &amp; 219–221.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXHbhsfaJAYC&amp;pg=PA140#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Servants of the Dynasty: Palace Women in World History|first=Anne|last=Walthall|date=1 January 2008|publisher=University of California Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qing implemented a policy of segregation between the Bannermen of the [[Eight Banners]] (Manchu Bannermen, Mongol Bannermen, Han Bannermen) and Han Chinese civilians{{when|date=July 2015}}. This ethnic segregation had cultural and economic reasons: intermarriage was forbidden to keep up the Manchu heritage and minimize [[sinicization]]. Han Chinese civilians and Mongol civilians [[Willow Palisade|were banned]] from settling in Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~inaasim/Mingqing04/Qing2.htm |title=From Ming to Qing |publisher=Darkwing.uoregon.edu |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Han civilians and Mongol civilians were banned from crossing into each other's lands. Ordinary Mongol civilians in Inner Mongolia were banned from even crossing into other [[Banners of Inner Mongolia|Mongol Banners]]. (A banner in Inner Mongolia was an administrative division and not related to the Mongol Bannermen in the Eight Banners)

These restrictions did not apply [[Eight Banners|Han Bannermen]], who were settled in Manchuria by the Qing. Han bannermen were differentiated from Han civilians by the Qing and treated differently.

The Qing Dynasty started [[Chuang Guandong|colonizing Manchuria with Han Chinese]] later on in the dynasty's rule, but the Manchu area was still separated from modern-day Inner Mongolia by the [[Willow Palisade|Outer Willow Palisade]], which kept the Manchu and the Mongols in the area separate.

The policy of segregation applied directly to the [[Eight Banners|banner]] garrisons, most of which occupied a separate walled zone within the cities in which they were stationed. Manchu Bannermen, Han Bannermen, and Mongol Bannermen were separated from the Han civilian population. While the Manchus followed the governmental structure of the preceding [[Ming dynasty]], their ethnic policy dictated that appointments were split between Manchu noblemen and Han Chinese civilian officials who had passed the highest levels of the [[Imperial examinations|state examinations]], and because of the small number of Manchus, this insured that a large fraction of them would be government officials.

===Italy===
In 1938, the [[Italian Fascism|fascist regime]] led by [[Benito Mussolini]], under pressure from the Nazis, introduced a series of [[Italian Racial Laws]] instituting an official segregationist policy in the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italian Empire]], especially aimed against Jews. This policy enforced various segregationist norms, like the prohibition for Jews to teach or study in ordinary schools and universities, to own industries reputed of major national interest, to work as journalists, to enter the military, and to wed non-Jews.
Some of the immediate consequences of the introduction of the 'provvedimenti per la difesa della razza' (norms for the defence of the race) included many of the best Italian scientists leaving their job, or even Italy. Amongst these, world-renowned physicists [[Emilio Segrè]], [[Enrico Fermi]] (whose wife was Jewish), [[Bruno Pontecorvo]], [[Bruno Rossi]], [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], mathematicians [[Federigo Enriques]] and [[Guido Fubini]] and even the fascist propaganda director, art critic and journalist [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who was one of Mussolini's mistresses. [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]], who would successively win the [[Nobel Prize for Medicine]], was forbidden to work at the university. [[Albert Einstein]], upon approval of the racial law, resigned from honorary membership of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]].

After 1943, when Northern Italy was [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|occupied by the Nazis]], Italian Jews were rounded up for the Holocaust.

===Jewish segregation===
Jews in Europe generally were forced, by decree or by informal pressure, to live in highly segregated [[ghettos]] and [[shtetls]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wirth, Louis]]. ''The Ghetto''. Transaction Publishers (1997), pp. 29–40. {{ISBN|1-56000-983-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1204 the [[papacy]] required Jews to segregate themselves from Christians and to wear distinctive clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/projects/margin/jew.htm |title=A Short History of the Jewish Tradition |publisher=.kenyon.edu |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced segregation of Jews spread throughout Europe during the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/232679/ghetto Ghetto]. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Russian Empire]], Jews were restricted to the so-called [[Pale of Settlement]], the Western frontier of the Russian Empire corresponding roughly to the modern-day countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-215022/anti-Semitism |title=Anti-Semitism in modern Europe |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century, the majority of European Jews lived in the Pale of Settlement.

Jewish population were confined to [[mellah]]s in [[Morocco]] beginning from the 15th century. In cities, a ''mellah'' was surrounded by a wall with a fortified gateway. In contrast, rural ''mellahs'' were separate villages inhabited solely by the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sefarad.org/publication/lm/017/morocco.html |title=The Jews of Morocco, by Ralph G. Bennettett |publisher=Sefarad.org |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, [[J. J. Benjamin]] wrote about the life of [[History of Jews in Iran|Persian Jews]]:
{{quote|…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town…; for they are considered as unclean creatures…  Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt…  For the same reason, they are prohibited to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmans…  If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults. The passers-by spit in his face, and sometimes beat him… unmercifully…  If a Jew enters a shop for anything, he is forbidden to inspect the goods… Should his hand incautiously touch the goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them... Sometimes the Persians intrude into the dwellings of the Jews and take possession of whatever please them. Should the owner make the least opposition in defense of his property, he incurs the danger of atoning for it with his life... If... a Jew shows himself in the street during the three days of the Katel (Muharram)…, he is sure to be murdered.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp. 181–183&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Latin America===
Spanish colonists created [[casta|caste systems]] in [[Latin American]] countries based on classification by race and race mixture. An extensive nomenclature developed, including the familiar terms "[[mulatto]]", "[[mestizo]]", and "[[zambo]]" (the latter the origin of "[[sambo (racial term)|sambo]]"). The Spanish had practiced a form of caste system in [[Hispania]] before their expulsion of the Jews and Muslims. While many Latin American countries have long since rendered the system officially illegal through legislation, usually at the time of independence, [[prejudice]] based on degrees of perceived racial distance from European ancestry combined with one's socioeconomic status remain, an echo of the colonial caste system.&lt;ref&gt;Soong, Roland. [http://www.zonalatina.com/Zldata55.htm "Racial Classifications in Latin America"], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Howard F., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1870658 "Review"], ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 76, No. 5 (Dec. 1971), 1626–1628.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
On 16 May 1940 the ''[[Administrasjonsrådet]]'' asked [[Rikskommisariatet]] why radio receivers had been confiscated from Jews in Norway.&lt;ref name="Folk, fører og frifinnelse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/Folk-frer-og-frifinnelse-6730068.html|title=Folk, fører og frifinnelse|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That ''Administrasjonsrådet'' thereafter "quietly" accepted&lt;ref name="Folk, fører og frifinnelse"/&gt; racial segregation between Norwegian citizens, has been claimed by [[Tor Bomann-Larsen]]. Furthermore, he claimed that this segregation "created a [[precedent]]. 2 years later (with ''NS-styret'' in the ministries of Norway) Norwegian police [[Jewish deportees from Norway during World War II|arrested citizens at the addresses]] where radios had previously been confiscated from Jews.&lt;ref name="Folk, fører og frifinnelse"/&gt;

===Rhodesia===
Following a dispute over the terms for the granting of full independence, the British [[self-governing colony]] of [[Rhodesia]], governed by a predominantly white minority government, [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] in 1965. Led by Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]], it endured as an [[list of historical unrecognized states|unrecognized state]] under white rule for the next 14 years, with majority rule coming in 1979 with the [[Internal Settlement]] between Smith's government and moderate black nationalists, the associated [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia general election, 1979|multiracial]] elections and the reconstitution of the country as [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]], with Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]] at the helm of a [[Government of Zimbabwe Rhodesia|coalition cabinet]] comprising 12 blacks and five whites. This new order also failed to win legitimacy in the eyes of the world, and British control returned to the country in December 1979, following the [[Lancaster House Agreement]]. New elections were held [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980|in 1980]], and Zimbabwe gained recognized independence in April 1980, with [[Robert Mugabe]] as prime minister.

Laws enforcing segregation had been around before 1965, although many institutions simply ignored them. One highly publicized legal battle occurred in 1960 involving the opening of a new theatre that was to be open to all races; the proposed unsegregated [[public toilet]]s at the newly built [[Reps Theatre]] in 1959 caused an argument called "The Battle of the Toilets".

===South Africa===
{{Main article|Apartheid}}
[[File:DurbanSign1989.jpg|thumb|upright|right|"[[Apartheid]]": sign on Durban beach in English, [[Afrikaans]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]]]]
The [[apartheid]] system carried out by [[Afrikaner]] minority rule enacted a nationwide social policy "separate development" with the National Party victory in 1948, following the "colour bar"-discriminatory legislation dating back to the beginning of the [[Union of South Africa]] and the Boer republics before which, while repressive to black South Africans along with other minorities, had not gone nearly so far.

Apartheid laws can be generally divided into following acts. Firstly, the Population Registration Act in 1950 classified residents in South Africa into four racial groups: "black", "white", "[[Coloured]]", and "Indian" and noted their racial identities on their identifications. Secondly, the [[Group Areas Act]] in 1950 assigned different regions according to different races. People were forced to live in their corresponding regions and the action of passing the boundaries without a permit was made illegal, extending pass laws that had already curtailed black movement. Thirdly, under the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act in 1953, amenities in public areas, like hospitals, universities and parks, were labeled separately according to particular races. In addition, the Bantu Education Act in 1953 segregated national education in South Africa as well. Additionally, the government of the time enforced the [[pass laws]], which deprived black South Africans of their right to travel freely within their own country. Under this system black people were severely restricted from urban areas, requiring authorisation from a white employer to enter.

Uprisings and protests against apartheid appeared immediately when apartheid arose. As early as 1949, the youth wing of the African National Congress (ANC) advocated the ending of apartheid and suggested fighting against racial segregation by various methods. During the following decades, hundreds of anti-apartheid actions occurred, including those of the Black Consciousness Movement, students' protests, labor strikes, and church group activism etc. In 1991, the [[Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991|Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act]] was passed, repealing laws enforcing racial segregation, including the Group Areas Act.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard Zimmermann (1996). "Southern Cross: Civil Law and Common Law in South Africa". p. 90. Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Nelson Mandela won in the first multiracial democratic election in South Africa. His success fulfilled the ending of apartheid in South African history.

===United States===

[[File:Segregation 1938b.jpg|thumb|An African-American youth at a segregated drinking fountain in [[Halifax, North Carolina]], in 1938.]]

After [[Jim Crow]] laws were passed that segregated [[African Americans]] and Whites, the lives of those who were negatively affected saw no progress in their quest for equality. Racial segregation was not a new phenomenon, as almost four million blacks had been [[slavery in the United States|slave]]s before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How the end of slavery led to starvation and death for millions of black Americans|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/16/slavery-starvation-civil-war|publisher=The Guardian|date=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leon Litwack 2004"&gt;Leon Litwack, ''Jim Crow Blues'', Magazine of History (OAH Publications, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The laws passed segregated African Americans from Whites.

BBC. Retrieved August 9, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] abolished [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in America, [[Racism in the United States|racial discrimination]] became regulated by the so-called [[Jim Crow laws]], which mandated strict segregation of the races. Though many such laws were instituted shortly after fighting ended, they only became formalized after the 1877 end of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction period]]. The period that followed is known as the [[nadir of American race relations]]. The legislation (or in some states, such as Florida, the state constitutions) that mandated segregation lasted at least until [[Brown v. Board of Education]] (1954).

While the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] majority in the 1896 ''[[Plessy v.

Feelings between whites and blacks were so tense, even the jails were segregated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20040503/fonerkennedy |title=Brown at 50 |publisher=Thenation.com |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Eric Foner and Randall Kennedy, "Brown at 50", ''The Nation'', posted 15 April 2004 (3 May 2004 issue)--&gt;

Many U.S. states banned [[Interracial marriage in the United States|interracial marriage]]. While opposed to slavery in the U.S, in a speech in Charleston, Illinois in 1858, [[Abraham Lincoln]] stated, "I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people.

Institutionalized racial segregation was ended as an official practice during the [[civil rights movement]] by the efforts of such civil rights activists as [[Clarence M. Mitchell Jr.]], [[Rosa Parks]], and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], working for social and political freedom during the period from the end of World War II through the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] in 1964 and the [[Voting Rights Act]] in 1965 supported by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Many of their efforts were acts of [[Nonviolence|non-violent]] [[civil disobedience]] aimed at disrupting the enforcement of racial segregation rules and laws, such as refusing to give up a seat in the black part of the bus to a white person (Rosa Parks), or holding [[sit-in]]s at all-white [[wikt:diner|diners]].

By 1968 all forms of segregation had been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, and by 1970 support for formal legal segregation had dissolved. ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' of Topeka, [[Kansas]] in 1954 outlawed segregation in public schools. The [[Fair Housing Act]] of 1968, administered and enforced by the [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]], prohibited discrimination in the sale and rental of housing on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. Formal racial discrimination became illegal in school systems, businesses, the American military, other civil services and the government.

On 28 April 2007, the [[Council of Representatives of Bahrain|lower house]] of [[National Assembly of Bahrain|Bahraini Parliament]] passed a law banning unmarried migrant workers from living in residential areas. To justify the law MP Nasser Fadhala, a close ally of the government said "bachelors also use these houses to make alcohol, run prostitute rings or to rape children and housemaids".&lt;ref name="migrantworkers3"/&gt;

Sadiq Rahma, technical committee head, who is a member of [[Al Wefaq]] said: "The rules we are drawing up are designed to protect the rights of both the families and the Asian bachelors (..) these labourers often have habits which are difficult for families living nearby to tolerate (..) they come out of their homes half dressed, brew alcohol illegally in their homes, use prostitutes and make the neighbourhood dirty (..) these are poor people who often live in groups of 50 or more, crammed into one house or apartment," said Mr Rahma. "The rules also state that there must be at least one bathroom for every five people (..) there have also been cases in which young children have been sexually molested."&lt;ref name="GDN 23.1.2006"&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Tariq Kkonji]] | url = http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=133367 | title = 'No go' rule for bachelor labourers | publisher = [[Gulf Daily News]] | date=23 January 2006 | accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Since the 1970s, there has been a concern expressed by some academics that major Canadian cities are becoming more segregated on income and ethnic lines. Reports have indicated that the inner suburbs of post-merger Toronto&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost1&gt;{{cite news|last=Mendelson|first=Rachel|title=Vancouver Income Inequality Study Shows City Segregating Along Racial, Income Lines|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/03/12/vancouver-income-inequality-study_n_1334796.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=12 March 2012|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the southern bedroom communities of Greater Vancouver&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; have become steadily more immigrant and [[visible minority]] dominated communities and have lagged behind other neighbourhoods in average income. A CBC panel in Vancouver in 2012 discussed the growing public fear that the proliferation of [[ethnic enclaves]] in Greater Vancouver (such as Han Chinese in [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] and Punjabis in [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]]) amounted to a type of [[self-segregation]]. In response to these fears, many minority activists have pointed out that most Canadian neighbourhoods remain predominately White, and yet Whites are never accused of "self-segregation".

A long-standing practice of national segregation has also been imposed upon the commercial salmon fishery in British Columbia since 1992 when separate commercial fisheries were created for select aboriginal groups on three B.C. river systems.

[[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] proclaims equal rights to all citizens regardless of ethnicity, denomination or race. Israel has a substantial list of laws that demand racial equality (such as prohibition of [[Prohibition of Discrimination in Products, Services and Entry into Places of Entertainment and Public Places Law, 2000|discrimination]], [[Employment (Equal Opportunities) Law, 1988|equality in Employment]], libel based on race or ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:חוק איסור לשון הרע]]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Due to many cultural differences, and animosity towards a minority perceived to wish to annihilate Israel, a system of passively co-existing communities, segregated along ethnic lines has emerged in Israel, with Arab-Israeli minority communities being left "marooned outside the mainstream". This de facto segregation also exists between different Jewish ethnic groups ("''edot''")  such as [[Sepharadim]], [[Ashkenazim]] and [[Beta Israel]] (Jews of Ethiopian descent),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethiopian Jewish Immigrants in Israel: The Homeland Postponed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EwgJDV8Ho0cC&amp;pg=9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=9|year=2001|first=Tanya|last=Schwartz|isbn=9780700712380}}&lt;/ref&gt; which   leads to de facto segregated schools, housing and public policy.

=== Kenya ===
The end of British colonial rule in Kenya in 1964 led to an inadvertent increase in ethnic segregation. Through private purchases and government schemes, farm land previously held by European farmers was transferred to African owners. These farms were further sub-divided into smaller localities, and, due to joint migration, many adjacent localities were occupied by members of different ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Undercurrents of Ethnic Conflicts in Kenya |last=Oucho |first=John |publisher=Brill |year=2002 |isbn=90-04-12459-4 |location=Leiden |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pages needed|date=April 2017}} This separation along these boundaries persists today.

The number of slaves in the country was not known exactly, but it was estimated to be up to 600,000 men, women and children, or 20% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mauritania made slavery illegal last month|author=Corrigan, T.|url=http://www.saiia.org.za/governance-and-aprm-opinion/mauritania-made-slavery-illegal-last-month|newspaper=The East African|date=6 September 2007|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1458_abolition/page4.shtml|title=BBC World Service - The Abolition season on BBC World Service|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries, the so-called [[Haratin]] lower class, mostly poor black Africans living in rural areas, have been considered natural slaves by white Moors of Arab/Berber ancestry. Many descendants of the [[Arab]] and [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes today still adhere to the [[supremacist]] ideology of their ancestors. This ideology has led to oppression, discrimination and even enslavement of other groups in the region of [[Sudan]] and Western [[Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=70522 |title=Fair elections haunted by racial imbalance |publisher=Irinnews.org |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iabolish.org/slavery_today/in_depth/sudan-genocide.html |title=War and Genocide in Sudan |publisher=Iabolish.org |accessdate=18 January 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927031133/http://www.iabolish.org/slavery_today/in_depth/sudan-genocide.html |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=75756 |title=Mauritania: The real beginning of the end of slavery? |publisher=Irinnews.org |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom has no legally sanctioned system of racial segregation and has a substantial list of laws that demand racial equality.&lt;ref name="gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1976/74|title=Race Relations Act 1976 (Repealed)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, due to many cultural differences between the pre-existing system of passively co-existing communities, segregation along racial lines has emerged in parts of the United Kingdom, with minority communities being left "marooned outside the mainstream".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4273414.stm |work=BBC News | title=Britons warned over 'segregation' | date=22 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The affected and 'ghettoised' communities are often largely representative of [[Pakistanis]], Indians and other Sub-Continentals, and has been thought to be the basis of ethnic tensions, and a deterioration of the standard of living and levels of education and employment among ethnic minorities in poorer areas. These factors are considered by some to have been a cause of the 2001 race riots in Bradford, Oldham and Burnley in the north of England which have large Asian communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1702799.stm |work=BBC News | title=Race 'segregation' caused riots | date=11 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ccsr.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccsr.ac.uk/staff/Ludi/documents/UrbS_41_3_2004.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609214608/http://www.ccsr.ac.uk/staff/Ludi/documents/UrbS_41_3_2004.pdf |archivedate=9 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may be some indication that such segregation, particularly in residential terms, seems to be the result of the unilateral 'steering' of ethnic groups into particular areas as well as a culture of vendor discrimination and distrust of ethnic minority clients by some estate agents and other property professionals.&lt;ref&gt;PHILLIPS, D. (2002) Movement to opportunity? South Asian relocation in northern cities. End of Award report, ESRC R000238038. School of Geography, University of Leeds. Pg.7.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be indicative of a market preference amongst the more wealthy to reside in areas of less ethnic mixture; less ethnic mixture being perceived as increasing the value and desirability of a residential area. This is likely as other theories such as "ethnic [[Auto-segregation|self segregation]]" have sometimes been shown to be baseless, and a majority of ethnic respondents to a few surveys on the matter have been in favour of wider social and residential integration.&lt;ref name="ccsr.ac.uk"/&gt;

=== {{anchor|RS-US}} United States===
[[De facto#Segregation (during the Civil Rights Era in the United States)|De facto segregation]] in the United States has increased since the [[civil rights movement]].&lt;ref name=Kozol2005&gt;{{cite book|last=Kozol|first=Jonathan|title=The Shame of the Nation|year=2005|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4000-5245-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court ruled in [[Milliken v. Bradley]] (1974) that de facto racial segregation was acceptable, as long as schools were not actively making policies for racial exclusion; since then, schools have been segregated due to myriad indirect factors.&lt;ref name=Kozol2005/&gt;

[[Redlining]] is the practice of denying or increasing the cost of services, such as banking, insurance, access to jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/services/psfiles/dp99/dp9913.pdf |title=Racial Discrimination and Redlining in Cities |format=PDF |accessdate=18 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513204845/http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/services/psfiles/dp99/dp9913.pdf |archivedate=13 May 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; access to health care,&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Race and health]]&lt;/ref&gt;  or even supermarkets&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/ptc5hvexthe7wrye/ In poor health: Supermarket redlining and urban nutrition], Elizabeth Eisenhauer, [[GeoJournal]]  Volume 53, Number 2 / February 2001&lt;/ref&gt; to residents in certain, often racially determined,&lt;ref name="eastny"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TWo8OFJpFtAC How East New York Became a Ghetto] by Walter Thabit. {{ISBN|0-8147-8267-1}}. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; areas. The most devastating form of redlining, and the most common use of the term, refers to [[Mortgage Discrimination|mortgage discrimination]]. Over the next twenty years, a succession of further court decisions and federal laws, including the ''[[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]]'' and measure to end [[Mortgage Discrimination|mortgage discrimination]] in 1975, would completely invalidate ''[[de jure]]'' racial segregation and discrimination in the U.S., although ''de facto'' segregation and discrimination have proven more resilient. According to the Civil Rights Project at [[Harvard University]], the actual de facto desegregation of U.S. public schools peaked in the late 1980s; since that time, the schools have, in fact, become more segregated mainly due to the ethnic segregation of the nation with whites dominating the suburbs and minorities the urban centers. According to Rajiv Sethi, an economist at Columbia University, black-white segregation in housing is slowly declining for most metropolitan areas in the US.&lt;ref&gt;''Inequality and Segregation''

The desire of many whites to avoid having their children attend integrated schools has been a factor in [[white flight]] to the suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580651_3/Segregation_in_the_United_States.html#s15 |title=VI De Facto Segregation |accessdate=9 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430211002/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580651_3/Segregation_in_the_United_States.html#s15 |archivedate=30 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study in San Francisco showed that groups of homeowners of all races tended to self-segregate in order to be with people of the same education level and race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bayer|first=Patrick|author2=Fernando Ferreira |author3=Robert McMillan |title=A Unified Framework for Measuring Preferences for Schools and Neighborhoods|journal=Journal of Political Economy|date=August 2007|volume=115|issue=4|pages=588–638|doi=10.1086/522381|ssrn=466280|url=http://real.wharton.upenn.edu/~fferreir/documents/522381.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, the legal barriers enforcing segregation had been mostly replaced by decentralized racism, where whites pay more than blacks to live in predominantly white areas.&lt;ref name="vigdor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cutler|first=David M.|author2=Edward L.

Regulations ensure that all housing units are expensive enough to prevent access by undesirable groups. By bidding up the price of housing, many white neighborhoods effectively shut out blacks, because blacks are unwilling, or unable, to pay the premium to buy entry into these expensive neighborhoods. Conversely, equivalent housing in black neighborhoods is far more affordable to those who are unable or unwilling to pay a premium to live in white neighborhoods. Through the 1990s, residential segregation remained at its extreme and has been called "[[hypersegregation]]" by some sociologists or "American Apartheid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Massey D.S., Denton N. A. |title=American Apartheid. |place=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''Johnson v. California'' {{ussc|543|499|2005}} that the [[California Department of Corrections]]' unwritten practice of racially segregating prisoners in its prison reception centers—which California claimed was for inmate safety (gangs in California, as throughout the U.S., usually organize on racial lines)—is to be subject to [[strict scrutiny]], the highest level of constitutional review.

[[File:Briefoeffner mit kuvert und hand fcm.jpg|thumb|Someone opening a letter before it has been delivered commits a crime]]
The '''secrecy of correspondence''' ({{lang-de|Briefgeheimnis}}, {{lang-fr|secret de la correspondance}}) or literally translated as '''secrecy of letters''', is a fundamental [[legal principle]] enshrined in the [[constitution]]s of several European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Legal Protection of the Secrecy of Correspondence |author=Roxana Maria |journal=Curentul ”Juridic” |year=2009 |number=1 |location=Tîrgu-Mureş, România |url=http://revcurentjur.ro/arhiva/attachments_200901/recjurid091_10F.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=1936 Constitution of the USSR |chapter=Chapter X, Fundamental Rights and Duties of Citizens, Article 128 |url=http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/russian/const/36cons04.html#chap10 |quote=The inviolability of the homes of citizens and privacy of correspondence are protected by law.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

It is thus the main legal basis for the assumption of '''privacy of correspondence'''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The principle has been naturally extended to other forms of [[telecommunication|communication]], including [[telephony]] and [[electronic communication]]s on the [[Internet]] as the constitutional guarantees are generally thought to cover also these forms of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Constitution to extend protection to e-mails |date=11 July 2014 |publisher=Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations - Government of the Netherlands |url=http://www.government.nl/ministries/bzk/news/2014/07/16/constitution-to-extend-protection-to-e-mails.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, national telecommunications privacy laws may allow [[lawful interception]], i.e. [[wiretapping]] and monitoring of electronic communications in cases of [[Suspect|suspicion of crime]]. Paper letters have in most jurisdictions remained outside the legal scope of law enforcement [[surveillance]], even in cases of ''"reasonable searches and seizures"''.

When applied to electronic communication, the principle protects not only the content of the communication, but also the information on when and to whom any messages (if any) have been sent (see: [[Call detail record]]s), and in the case of [[Mobile phone|mobile communication]], the [[location information]] of the mobile units. As a consequence, in jurisdictions with a safeguard on secrecy of letters, location data collected from mobile phone networks has a higher level of protection than data collected by [[vehicle telematics]] or transport tickets.

==United States==
{{See also|Third-party doctrine}}
In the [[United States]] there is no specific constitutional guarantee on the privacy of correspondence. The secrecy of letters and correspondence is derived through [[litigation]] from the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. In an 1877 case the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No law of [[United States Congress|Congress]] can place in the hands of officials connected with the [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] any authority to invade the '''secrecy of letters''' and such sealed packages in the mail; and all regulations adopted as to mail matter of this kind must be in subordination to the great principle embodied in the fourth amendment of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Jackson'', {{ussc| source=f |96|727|1877| pin=733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The protection of the Fourth Amendment has been extended beyond the home in other instances. A protection similar to that of correspondence has [[California v. Greenwood|even been argued]] to extend to the contents of [[trash can]]s outside one's house, although unsuccessfully. Like all rights derived through litigation, the secrecy of correspondence is subject to interpretations.  By Supreme Court precedent, rights derived from the Fourth Amendment are limited by the legal test of a "[[reasonable expectation of privacy]]".

The '''Special Frontier Force (SFF)''' is a [[Paramilitary forces of India|paramilitary special force]] of [[India]] created on 14 November 1962. Its main goal originally was to conduct covert operations behind Chinese lines in the event of another [[Sino-Indian War]].

The SFF is also known as 'Establishment 22' or just '22' due to its first Inspector General, Major General Sujan Singh Uban (Retd.) of Indian Army,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/ColumnsOthers/The-curious-case-of-establishment-22/Article1-476533.aspx |title=The curious case of establishment 22 |publisher=hindustantimes.com |date=14 November 2009 |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who used to be commander of 22 Mountain Regiment during World War II,&lt;ref name="bharat-rakshak1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/SFF.html |title=Land Forces Site – SFF |publisher=Bharat Rakshak |date= |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Military Cross]] holder and a legendary figure in the [[British India Army]].

==History==
Ethnic [[Tibetans]] have been a part and parcel of the modern [[Indian Army]] for as long as it has existed. Independent formations of Tibetan (including [[Ladakh]]i, [[Bön]], and [[Sikkim]]ese) units were to patrol and police the lands they were native to. During the time of the [[Great Game]], the British Indian Army began to employ Tibetans as spies, intelligence agents, and even covert militia in [[northern India]] and Tibet proper.

At the time of [[Partition of India|Indian independence]], the Northern Mountain covered region of India remained the most isolated and strategically overlooked territory of the subcontinent. During the 1950s, the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Indian Intelligence Bureau]] established Mustang Base in [[Mustang (kingdom)|Mustang]] in Nepal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/jan/08spec.htm|title=The Phantoms of Chittagong|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which trained Tibetans in [[guerilla warfare]]. The Mustang rebels brought the [[14th Dalai Lama]] to India during the [[1959 Tibetan Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/archive/index.php/index.php/t-37833.html|title=Militaryphotos.net|website=www.militaryphotos.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
[[File:Special Frontier Forces troops (Indian Army) training in jungle warfare.jpg|thumb|Special Frontier Force training]]
After the [[Sino-Indian war]] and towards the end of 1962, after hectic lobbying by Intelligence Bureau (IB), the [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru government]] ordered the raising of an elite [[commando]] unit and specialised mountain divisions primarily composed of [[Tibetan resistance]] fighters. [[Chushi Gangdruk]] leaders were contacted for recruitment of [[Kham]]pas into this new unit. An initial strength of 5000 men, mostly Khampas were recruited at its new Mountain Training Facility at [[Chakrata]], [[Dehradun]].

The SFF made its home base at Chakrata, 100&amp;nbsp;km from the city of Dehra Dun. Chakrata was home to the large Tibetan refugee population and was a mountain town in the foothills of the Himalayas. Starting with a force of 12,000 men, the SFF commenced six months of training in rock climbing and guerrilla warfare. The Intelligence agencies from India and the US also helped in raising the force; namely CIA &amp; RAW. The SFF's weapons were all provided by the US and consisted mainly of M-1, M-2 and M-3 machine guns. Heavy weapons were not provided.&lt;ref name="bharat-rakshak1"/&gt;

Established under the direct supervision of the Prime Minister and on the advice of [[Bhola Nath Mullik]], the then director of the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau of India]] and [[Biju Patnaik]], a [[World War II]] veteran and the then chief minister of [[Odisha]],&lt;ref name="The curious case of establishment 22"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/the-curious-case-of-establishment-22/story-eiDenZvNioffJFupLzNGOI.html |title=The curious case of establishment 22 |last=Sanyal |first=Amitava |date=2009-11-14 |access-date=2018-05-26 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the unit under the operational command of IB and later [[R&amp;AW]], was designated the Special Frontier Force (SFF), and was primarily used for conducting [[clandestine operation|clandestine]] [[intelligence]] gathering and commando operations along the Chinese Theatre. Initial training was conducted by the CIA paramilitary officers and the IB's own [[special operations]] unit. In 1968 SFF, with the help of the [[Aviation Research Centre]] which provided airlift facilities, became fully airborne-qualified and a dedicated [[Mountain warfare|mountain]] and [[jungle warfare]] unit.

During this period, the Indian government also formed the [[Ladakh Scouts]] and the Nubra Guards paramilitary force on similar lines. Many SFF members are Gorkha Rifles members due to their bodies being able to perform much better in high altitudes against others. SFF was later incorporated in the Special Services Bureau (SSB) of R&amp;AW. By late 1963, inter-service rivalry led to severe criticism by the Indian Army. To prove that the SFF's worth, the Inspector General sent 120 men from the SFF for a field exercise, codenamed Garuda, with the Army. The exercise proved to be a dramatic success for the SFF and the Army was now less inclined to criticise the force. In 1964, the SFF led by the Inspector General, began its airborne training at Agra. The SFF then began its own airborne training program at [[Sarsawa Air Force Station|Sarsawa airbase near Saharanpur]]. By the late 1960s, the SFF was organised into six battalions for administrative purposes. Each battalion, consisting of six companies, was commanded by Tibetan who had a rank equivalent to a lieutenant colonel in the Army. A Tibetan major or captain commanded each company, which was the primary unit used in operations. Females also participated in the force and they were in the signal and medical companies. During this time, the SFF was never used against its intended enemy, China. However, the unit did conduct limited cross-border reconnaissance operations, as well as highly classified raids to place sensors in the Himalayas to detect Chinese nuclear and missile tests.&lt;ref name="bharat-rakshak1"/&gt;

==SFF operations==
SFF was raised with covert operations in mind, mainly along the Indo-China border, however SFF has been fielded by R&amp;AW and the Indian government in various covert and overt operation theatres.&lt;ref name="bharat-rakshak1"/&gt;

===China===
In 1964 intelligence reports kept indicating that China was preparing to test a nuclear bomb at its [[Lop Nor]] nuclear installation in [[Xinjiang]]. On 16 October 1964 China tested a nuclear weapon in Xinjiang. It was expected but not enough details were known. Later in November 1964, the CIA launched a [[Lockheed U-2|U2]] flight out of [[Aviation Research Centre]] (ARC)'s [[Charbatia Air Base]] in Orissa, but its return turned out to be a bit of a mishap.&lt;ref name=ht16a13&gt;{{cite news|title=India used US spy planes to map Chinese incursion in Sino-Indian war|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Americas/India-used-US-spy-planes-to-map-Chinese-incursion-in-1962-war/Article1-1108481.aspx|accessdate=16 August 2013|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nehru permitted CIA spy planes to use Indian air base|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/nehru-permitted-cia-spy-planes-to-use-indian-air-base-113081600225_1.html|accessdate=16 August 2013|newspaper=Business Standard|date=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U2 overshot the runway and got stuck in slushy ground caused by heavy rain in the [[monsoons]]. Following the normalization of Sino-Indian Relations after Deng Xiaoping's market reform the SFF ceased most of their operations within the [[PRC]].

Getting it unstuck and out of India without being noticed by the Indian press, then even much more subject to leftist influences and hence antagonistic to the USA, was another clandestine operation. This gave all concerned quite a scare and it was decided to rely on other technical means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiadefence.com/himalayas.htm |title=WHAT |publisher=Indiadefence.com |date= |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; So [[CIA]] decided to launch an [[ELINT]] operation along with R&amp;AW and [[Aviation Research Centre|ARC]] to track China's nuclear tests and monitor its missile launches.

The operation, in the garb of a mountaineering expedition to [[Nanda Devi]] involved celebrated Indian climber [[M S Kohli]] who along with operatives of Special Frontier Force and CIA (most notably Jim Rhyne, a veteran [[STOL]] pilot), was to place a permanent ELINT device, a transceiver powered by a [[plutonium battery]], that could detect and report data on future nuclear tests carried out by China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vayu-sena.tripod.com/other-spies-in-the-himalayas.html|title=Book Extract - Spies in the Himalayas - Vayu Sena|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan to install a snooping device was hatched far away in Washington D.C., in the offices of the [[National Geographic Society]]. [[Barry Bishop (mountaineer)|Barry Bishop]], a photographer with the magazine, interested Gen. [[Curtis LeMay]] of the [[US Air Force]] in the idea.

The actual efforts called for to place a permanent [[electronic intelligence]] (ELINT) device powered by a nuclear SNAP 19C power pack fuel cell. The first attempt to place this device on the Nanda Devi, by a Kohli-led SFF team under the cover of a mountaineering expedition failed as the team had to retreat in the face of adverse conditions and left the device in a small unmarked mountain cave after having hauled the device to just short of the 25,645 feet peak. When another Kohli-led expedition returned the following year to recover the device, it was found to be missing.&lt;ref name=ht16a13/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harish Kapadia, "Nanda Devi", in ''World Mountaineering'', Audrey Salkeld, editor, Bulfinch Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8212-2502-2}}, pp. 254–257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There are many theories about what happened. Most of likely ones are that the device rolled off the mountain and is now lodged at the bottom of the glacier. More imaginative theories speculate that the supposedly indestructible nuclear power pack with a highly toxic [[plutonium]] isotope in its core, with a half-life of many thousand years is inching its way into the [[Ganges]]. Another plausible theory is that another team of Indian mountaineers came up furtively early the next season and spirited away the device for Indian nuclear scientists to study. Many Americans lean towards this, and with the legendary spymaster, [[R. N. Kao|RN Kao]] in the picture anything was possible.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime the Chinese not only kept testing nuclear weapons at regular intervals but also ballistic missiles. The urgency to gather information was never greater. Another mission was launched in 1967 to place a similar device on the [[Nanda Kot]]. This mission was successful but a couple of years later another problem cropped up; snow would pile up over the antenna and render it blind. So Kohli and a SFF team were sent once again to bring it down, this time they retrieved it successfully.

In October 1967 the Chinese began testing an [[ICBM]] capable of reaching targets 6000 miles away. There was renewed urgency to find out more. So SFF [[mountaineers]] went off on one more mission in December 1969 to successfully place a gas powered device on an undisclosed mountain supposedly in Chinese controlled areas. But by the following year, the US had the first generation of the TRW [[spy satellites]] in place and did not have to rely on the old ELINT devices.

===Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971===
[[File:Bangladesh 1971 Liberation.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Illustration showing military units and troop movements during the war]]
SFF was extremely successful against Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistan Military Conflict of 1971. Elements of the force were sent to [[Mizoram]] in late November 1971. A strong Task Force was deployed and conducted [[pre-emptive strike]] operations in support of the Indian army formations along the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]].

1971 saw the SFF being used in major combat in the Indo-Pak war. Elements of the force were sent to Mizoram in late October. By November 1971, around 3000 SFF members were deployed next to the Chittagong Hill Tracts. With cross-border attacks becoming more frequent, the SFF was then ordered to attack the Chittagong Hill Tracts. For this operation, code-named 'Eagle', the SFF members were given Bulgarian AK-47s and US carbines. This operation saw the first Dapon, Tibetan equivalent of a Brigadier, to command part of the SFF task force.

With war right around the corner, the SFF was given several mission plans, including the destruction of the Kaptai Dam and other bridges. The Inspector General urged that the SFF be used to capture Chittagong, but this was found not favourable, since SFF members did not have artillery or airlift support to conduct a mission of that magnitude. After three weeks of border fighting, the SFF divided its six battalions into three columns and moved into East Pakistan on 3 December 1971. After capturing several villages in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the Tibetans were given mortars and recoilless rifles and also two Indian Air Force Mi-4 helicopters.

With the Pakistani Lt. General A.A.K. Niazi surrendering on 16 December, the SFF had lost 56 men and nearly 190 wounded. The SFF was able to block a potential escape route for East Pakistani forces into Burma. They also halted members of Pakistan's 97 Independent Brigade and 2 Commando Battalion in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. For their bravery and courage in battle, 580 SFF members were awarded cash prizes by the Indian Govt. In 1973, the original Inspector General of the SFF was replaced and in 1975 a new rule pertaining to the SFF was issued. This prohibited the SFF from being deployed within 10&amp;nbsp;km of the Indo-Chinese border. This came about after several incidents in which SFF commandos had crossed the border and conducted unsanctioned cross-border operations.

They trained the Bangladeshi underground unit, [[Mujib Bahini]] for their secret missions. For the Bangladeshi campaign, designated ''Operation Mountain Eagle'', the SFF members were issued Bulgarian [[AK-47]]'s and US carbines. SFF conducted several mission, including the destruction of the [[Kaptai Dam]] and other bridges.

===Internal operations===
SFF was used in combating communal riots in mid 1970s. During the [[Operation Blue Star]] in 1984 the force was used to clear up [[Akal Takht]] of the [[Golden Temple]].&lt;ref name="Katoch"&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview Lt Gen PC Katoch |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxitMTQK-GE?t=8m59s |publisher=Operation Blue Star - The Untold Story by Kanwar Sandhu - 4 |accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used briefly for VIP security in late 1984 around the Prime Minister following the assassination of [[Indira Gandhi]]. Later this role fell upon the [[Special Protection Group]].

In 1975 a new rule pertaining to the SFF was issued, this prohibited the SFF from being deployed to within 10&amp;nbsp;km of the Indo-Chinese border unless under explicit instructions. This came about after several incidents in which SFF was found to be conducting unsanctioned cross-border raids and intelligence operations.

'''Stand Up for Europe''' is a [[Pan-European identity|pan-European]] [[political movement|citizens' movement]] that campaigns for a more democratic and [[Federalisation of the European Union|federal Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170131133632/http://standupforeurope.eu/about/ | Self-description on Stand Up For Europe's website.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grassroots"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dw.com/en/the-pro-europe-grassroots-movements-aimed-at-saving-the-eu/a-38252439 |title=The pro-Europe grassroots movements aimed at saving the EU |work=Deutsche Welle |date=1 April 2017 |accessdate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Stand Up For Europe was launched at the 6th European Federalist Convention in [[Brussels]] on 3 December 2016, through the integration of three eurofederalist movements: Stand up for the United States of Europe, the [[European Federalist Party]], and United States of Europe Now. It was one of several new pro-European civil movements that sprang up in response to the anti-European outcome of the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit referendum]] and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|election of Donald Trump as U.S. President]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.liberation.fr/debats/2017/05/09/emmanuel-macron-une-opportunite-pour-reinventer-l-europe_1568379 |title=Emmanuel Macron, une opportunité pour réinventer l’Europe |work=[[Libération]] |date=9 May 2017 |accessdate=12 May 2017 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 May 2017, Stand Up For Europe was one of the co-sponsors of a day-long debate in Brussels, led by the [[European Committee of the Regions]]'s chair [[Markku Markkula]], on the future of the European Union, and how to advance European integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.ansa.it/europa/notizie/rubriche/europa_delle_regioni/2017/05/04/regioni-europee-convocano-i-movimenti-pro-ue-a-bruxelles_6b130e71-3b4c-4706-be7b-f23916099c84.html |title=Regioni europee convocano i movimenti pro-Ue a Bruxelles |work=Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata |date=4 May 2017 |accessdate=12 May 2017 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==

Stand Up For Europe is set up as a [[nonprofit organisation]] (''[[Association sans but lucratif]]'', ASBL) under Belgian law.&lt;ref&gt;Statutes of Stand Up For Europe (22 February 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grassroots"/&gt; Richard Laub, Georgios Kostakos, Olivier Boruchowitch, and Pietro De Matteis are listed as its founders. The organisation has the following bodies: (i) General Meeting, (ii) Executive Board, (iii) Group of Advisors, (iv) Dispute Committee, (v) Auditor, and (vi) Ombudsman. The General Meeting is convened at least once per calendar year between November and February. It appoints the members of the Executive Board by simple majority vote for a renewable period of one year. Among others, the Board comprises the following positions, which are filled by the following persons:
* President: Alain Deneef
* Vice-President: Luca Polidori
* General Secretary: Benjamin de Vanssay
* Treasurer: Faedran Bourhani

As an urban civil movement, Stand Up For Europe's activities are organised around 20 "city teams" and seven university groups (February 2017).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standupforeurope.eu/|Stand Up For Europe website; retrieved February 22nd, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; It participates in pro-European rallies in various cities with like-minded groups, to help the process of Europeanisation in people's minds and actions.&lt;ref name="grassroots"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.ilmattino.it/napoli/cronaca/giovani_piazza_la_festa_europa_primo_caffe_europeo-2427123.html |title=Giovani in piazza per la Festa dell'Europa: il primo caffè europeo |author=Delia Paciello |work=Il Mattino |date=9 May 2017 |accessdate=12 May 2017 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The agency was established in 1975 by the four public universities in [[Western Australia]];  [[Curtin University of Technology]], [[Edith Cowan University]], [[Murdoch University]] and The [[University of Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adcet.edu.au/View.aspx?id=3419 |title=Weblink |publisher=ADCET |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of TISC is to process university enrollment applications by assessing applicants and ranking eligible applicants in order of merit for each programme following the rules and criteria given by the individual universities. TISC does not approve who will be enrolled into a programme or university but coordinates the process as an intermediary between the applicant and the university. They also relay offers on behalf of participating universities to the applicants.

It is not a statutory or government body and is funded both by the participating universities and the processing fees charged to applicants.

'''''The Great Illusion''''' is a book by [[Norman Angell]], first published in the United Kingdom in 1909 under the title ''Europe's Optical Illusion''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Angell |first=Norman |title=Europe's Optical Illusion|edition=1|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent &amp; Co.|publication-date=1909|publication-place=London|page=|url=https://archive.org/stream/europesopticalil00angeuoft#page/n7/mode/2up |accessdate=15 June 2016|via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and republished in 1910 and subsequently in various enlarged and revised editions under the title ''The Great Illusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Angell |first=Norman |title=The Great Illusion: A Study of the Relation of Military Power in Nations to their Economic and Social Advantage|edition=3|publisher=G.P. Putnam's &amp; Sons|publication-date=1911|publication-place=New York and London|page=|url=https://archive.org/details/greatillusion00angeiala|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

In ''The Great Illusion'', Angell's primary thesis was, in the words of historian [[James Joll]], that "the economic cost of war was so great that no one could possibly hope to gain by starting a war the consequences of which would be so disastrous."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Joll|Joll, James]] (1992) ''The Origins of the First World War''. London and New York: Longman. p.202 {{ISBN|0-582-08920-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For that reason, a general European war was very unlikely to start, and if it did, it would not last long.&lt;ref name=keegan&gt;[[John Keegan|Keegan, John]] (1999) ''The First World War'' New York: Knopf. p.10. {{ISBN|0-375-40052-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that war was economically and socially irrational&lt;ref name=pity&gt;[[Niall Ferguson|Ferguson, Niall]] (1999) ''The Pity of War'' New York: Basic Books. pp.21-23 {{ISBN|0-465-05712-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that war between industrial countries was futile because conquest did not pay. J. D. B. Miller writes: "The 'Great Illusion' was that nations gained by armed confrontation, militarism, war, or conquest."&lt;ref name=miller1985&gt;Miller (1995), p.105.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Angell, the economic interdependence between industrial countries would be "the real guarantor of the good behavior of one state to another",&lt;ref name=pity /&gt; as it meant that war would be economically harmful to all the countries involved. Moreover, if a conquering power confiscated property in the territory it seized, "the incentive [of the local population] to produce would be sapped and the conquered area be rendered worthless. Thus, the conquering power had to leave property in the hands of the local population while incurring the costs of conquest and occupation."&lt;ref name=miller1985 /&gt;

Further, the nature of modern capitalism was such that nationalist sentiment did not motivate capitalists, because "the capitalist has no country, and he knows, if he be of the modern type, that arms and conquests and jugglery with frontiers serve no ends of his, and may very well defeat them."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[James Joll|Joll, James]] (1992) ''The Origins of the First World War''. London and New York: Longman. p.161 {{ISBN|0-582-08920-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angell said that arms build-up, for example the naval race between England and Germany that was happening as he wrote the book in the 1900s, was not going to secure peace. Instead, it would lead to increased insecurity and thus ratchet up the likelihood of war. The only viable route to peace would be respect for international law, implemented in a world court, in which issues would be dealt with rationally and peacefully.

==Critical reception==

''The Great Illusion'' was a best-selling popular success and was quickly translated into eleven languages, becoming something of a "cult", spawning study groups at British universities "devoted to propagating its dogma." The book was taken up by [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Viscount Esher]], a courtier who was charged with remodeling the British Army after the [[Boer War]].&lt;ref name=guns&gt;[[Barbara Tuchman|Tuchman, Barbara]] (1962) ''[[The Guns of August]]'' New York: Macmillan. p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Also enamored of the book was [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral John Fisher]], the [[First Sea Lord]], who called it "heavenly manna".&lt;ref name=pity /&gt; Historian [[Niall Ferguson]] uses the receptiveness to the book of these paragons of the British military and naval establishments as evidence that it was not the pacifist work it superficially seemed to be, but instead a "Liberal imperialist tract directed at German opinion", with the aim of discouraging Germany from continuing its bid to become a great naval power, a program which had begun the fierce, and expensive, naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany.  The fact that Angell was employed as editor of the ''Continental Daily Mail'' by [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]], a press baron whom Ferguson refers to as an "arch-scaremonger", is to Ferguson further evidence of a deeper, non-pacifist purpose to the book.&lt;ref name=pity /&gt;

It is sometimes said that the outbreak of [[World War I]] disproved Angell's argument in ''The Great Illusion,'' but Angell had not maintained that a war was impossible, rather that it would be futile. Although some aspects of Angell's argument have dated, his discussion of economic interdependence "was important and innovative."&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1986), p.106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interwar edition==
A new edition of ''The Great Illusion'' was published in 1933; it added "the theme of collective defence."&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1986) p.120 n.9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Angell was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1933.

==In popular culture  ==
*''The Great Illusion'' is mentioned in the 1929 novel ''[[Death of a Hero]]'' by [[Richard Aldington]]. It was used as evidence by the main character that the coming world war would not happen.

*One of the characters in the [[D. K. Broster]] story "The Window" (1929), set in pre-World War I France, mentions having read Angell's book, and uses it to argue that "it is impossible that there should be a great war nowadays".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Andrew J. (2014) ''France, Britain and the United States in the twentieth century, 1900-1940: a reappraisal''. London: Palgrave Macmillan. p.48.  {{ISBN|9780230282308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The book lent its name to [[Jean Renoir]]'s 1937 anti-war film ''[[La Grande Illusion]]''.

'''Valerie Anita Aurora'''&lt;ref name="tricks" /&gt; is a software engineer and feminist activist. She was the co-founder of the [[Ada Initiative]],&lt;ref name=lwn&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aurora|first1=Valerie|title=The Ada Initiative launches|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/426842/|accessdate=July 3, 2014|work=LWN|date=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit organization that sought to increase women's participation in the [[free culture movement]], [[open source technology]], and open source culture.  Aurora is also known within the Linux community for advocating new developments in filesystems in Linux, including [[ChunkFS]] and the [[Union mount|Union file system]].&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;  Her birth name was Val Henson, but she changed it shortly before 2009, choosing her middle name after the computer scientist [[Anita Borg]].&lt;ref name="tricks" /&gt; In 2012, Aurora, and Ada Initiative co-founder [[Mary Gardiner]], were named two of the most influential people in [[computer security]] by ''[[SC Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="Earls" /&gt; In 2013, she won the [[O'Reilly Open Source Award]].&lt;ref name="oscon-award" /&gt;

== History ==

Aurora was raised in [[New Mexico]], and was home-schooled.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; She became involved in [[computer programming]] when she attended [[DEF CON]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=Earls /&gt; She studied computer science and mathematics at the [[New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology]].

== Programming ==

She first became involved with file systems when she worked with [[ZFS]] in 2002 at [[Sun Microsystems]].  She later moved to [[IBM]] where she worked in the group of [[Theodore Ts'o]], where they considered extensions to the [[ext2]] and [[ext3]] Linux file systems. While working at [[Intel]], she implemented the ext2 [[dirty bit]]&lt;ref&gt;This feature lets the user to skip [[fsck|file system checks]] after a crash (for example after a power fail), but only if the file system was idle at the time of crash.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[stat (system call)#Criticism of atime|relative atime]].  Along with Arjan van de Ven, she came up with the idea for ChunkFS, which simplifies [[fsck|file system checks]] by dividing the file system into independent pieces.  She also co-organized the first Linux File Systems Workshop in order to figure out how to spread awareness of and raise funding for file system development.  As of 2009, she worked for [[Red Hat]] as a file systems developer as well as a part-time science writer and Linux consultant.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;

== Ada Initiative ==

Already an activist for women in open source, she joined [[Mary Gardiner]] and members of the Geek Feminism blog to develop anti-harassment policies for conferences&lt;ref name="MarieClaire" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skud" /&gt; after Noirin Shirley was sexually assaulted at ApacheCon 2010.&lt;ref name="MarieClaire" /&gt; Aurora quit her job as a [[Linux kernel]] developer at Red Hat and, with Gardiner, founded the [[Ada Initiative]] in February 2011.&lt;ref name="ada-anon" /&gt; The organization was named after [[Ada Lovelace]], who worked with [[Charles Babbage]] and is considered to be the world's first computer programmer.&lt;ref name="MarieClaire" /&gt; Two years later, Aurora founded [[Double Union]], a [[hackerspace]] for women, with [[Amelia Greenhall]] and [[Liz Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/08/sexism-silicon-valley-women|title=Silicon Valley is cool and powerful. But where are the women?|first=Zoë|last=Corbyn|publisher=The Guardian|date=March 8, 2015|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ada Initiative was shut down in October 2015.&lt;ref name=shutdown&gt;[http://adainitiative.org/2015/08/04/announcing-the-shutdown-of-the-ada-initiative/ Announcing the shutdown of the Ada Initiative] August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing ==

Maintaining a blog since 2007, Aurora has written extensively about coding and the experiences of women in open source. This has included descriptions of [[DEF CON]] and the harassment that took place there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bust.com/girl-geeks-bust-creeps-for-sexual-harassment-at-defcon.html|title=Girl geeks bust creeps for sexual harassment at DEF CON|first=Amy|last=Bucknam|publisher=Bust|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Aurora provided a comment to ''[[The Verge]]'' about the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|Electronic Frontier Foundation's]] involvement in the legal defense of [[Andrew Auernheimer]], who was in prison for hacking and had previously harassed [[Kathy Sierra]]. Aurora said "This is another case where they're saying, 'The cases we care about are the ones white men are interested in. We’re less interested in protecting women on the web.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/12/4693710/the-end-of-kindness-weev-and-the-cult-of-the-angry-young-man|title=The end of kindness: Weev and the cult of the angry young man|first=Greg|last=Sandoval|publisher=The Verge|date=September 12, 2013|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comment was received negatively by the EFF's Director of International Freedom of Expression, [[Jillian York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@jilliancyork/harassment-hurts-us-all-so-does-censorship-6e1babd61a9b|title=Harassment hurts us all. So does censorship.|first=Jillian|last=York|publisher=Medium|date=September 13, 2013|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another 2013 controversy that received commentary from Aurora was [[Donglegate]] in which [[Python Conference|PyCon]] attendee Adria Richards faced backlash for reporting a conversation overheard between two men sitting near her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/03/25/adria_richards_her_firing_online_harassment_show_how_sexual_harassment_endures.html|title=Adria Richards' story shows how sexual harassment endures in tech community|first=Valerie|last=Aurora|publisher=Slate|date=March 25, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aurora condemned the threats sent to Richards and stated that [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], by using large numbers of computers, was "distorting social pressure". When asked if firing one of the males was an appropriate response, she said "I don't have enough information to know that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/society/adria-richards-ada-initiative-women-in-tech/|title=The Ada Initiative sounds off on the Adria Richards backlash|first=Aja|last=Romano|publisher=The Daily Dot|date=March 22, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Aurora praised the gender ratio at PyCon and called [[Guido van Rossum]] and the Python community "the biggest success story for women in open source." In the same interview, she approved of the culture of the website [[Tumblr]] and stated that [[Linus Torvalds|Linus Torvalds']] daughter Patricia was a positive role-model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linux.com/news/ally-skills-training-linuxcon-2015-uniting-all-worlds-geeks-no-exceptions|title=Ally Skills Training at LinuxCon2015: Uniting All the World’s Geeks, No Exceptions|first=Kim|last=Grob|date=October 6, 2015|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
