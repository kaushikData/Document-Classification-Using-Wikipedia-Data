In 2001, the [[eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality|eThekwini]] Municipality, which governs Durban and [[Pinetown]], embarked on a '[[slum clearance]] programme' that meant  the steady demolition of shack settlements and a refusal to provide basic services (e.g. electricity, sanitation etc.) to existing settlements on the grounds that all shack settlements were now 'temporary'. In these demolitions some shack dwellers were simply being left homeless and others subjected to unlawful forced evictions to the rural periphery of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cohre.org/southafrica |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219072803/http://www.cohre.org/southafrica |archivedate=19 December 2008 }} 'Business As Usual', Centre on Housing Rights &amp; Evictions (Geneva), 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session1/ZA/COHRE_ZAF_UPR_S1_2008_CentreonHousingRightsandEvictions_uprsubmission.pdf] COHRE report to the United Nations, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2008, the United Nations expressed serious concern about the treatment of shack dwellers in Durban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/7session/reports.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315175004/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/7session/reports.htm |archivedate=15 March 2008 }} United Nations Statement on Housing Rights Violations in South Africa&lt;/ref&gt; In the run up to 2010 there was also concern about the possibility of [[eviction]]s linked to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] across South Africa&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/12/south-africa-world-cup-2010] ''The Guardian'' World Cup 2010: football brings defining moment for South Africa, 12 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sundayherald.com"&gt;[http://www.sundayherald.com/international/shinternational/display.var.2524562.0.0.php The real winners and losers: of the beautiful game] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810233106/http://www.sundayherald.com/international/shinternational/display.var.2524562.0.0.php |date=10 August 2009 }}, ''Sunday Herald'' 9 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/12/south-africa-world-cup-2010 World Cup 2010: football brings defining moment for South Africa], 12 June 2009.

==History==

Abahlali's original work was primarily committed to opposing demolitions and forced removals and to struggling for good land and quality housing in the cities.&lt;ref name="How People Face Evictions"&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dpu/k_s/publications/how_ppl_face_evictions How People Face Evictions]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Prof. Yves Cabannes, Development Planning Unit, University College of London (DPU/UCL), May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In most instances this takes the form of a demand for shack settlements to be upgraded with formal housing and services where they are or for new houses to be built close to where the existing settlements are. However the movement has also argued that basic services such as water, electricity and toilets should be immediately provided to shack settlements while land and housing in the city are negotiated. The movement has also engaged in the mass popular appropriation of access to water and electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historymatters.co.za/2008/09/22/a-big-devil-in-the-shacks-the-politics-of-fire/ A big devil in the shacks: The politics of fire]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metamute.org/en/A-Short-History-of-Abahlali-baseMjondolo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013024804/http://www.metamute.org/en/A-Short-History-of-Abahlali-baseMjondolo |archivedate=13 October 2006 }} A-Short-History-of-Abahlali-baseMjondolo&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement quickly had a considerable degree of success in stopping evictions and forced removals, winning the right for new shacks to be built as settlements expand and in winning access to basic services,&lt;ref name="thoughtleader.co.za"&gt;[http://www.thoughtleader.co.za/imraanbuccus/2009/03/12/durban-breaks-new-ground-in-participatory-democracy/ Durban breaks new ground in participatory democracy, Imraan Buccus].

== Philosophy ==

The movement describes itself as "a homemade politics that everyone can understand and find a home in"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metamute.org/en/Thinking-Resistance-in-the-Shanty-Town Richard Pithouse' Thinking Resistance in the Shantytown', [[Mute Magazine]], August 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025005905/http://www.metamute.org/en/Thinking-Resistance-in-the-Shanty-Town |date=25 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and stresses that it moves from the lived experience of the poor to create a politics that is both intellectual and actional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spatialagency.net/database/abahlali.basemjondolo Abahlali baseMjondolo, Spatial Agency]. Spatialagency.net. Retrieved on 4 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its philosophy has been sketched out in a number of articles and interviews. The key ideas are those of a politics of the poor, a living politics and a people's politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jas.sagepub.com/content/47/5/498.abstract Abahlali’s Vocal Politics of Proximity: Speaking, Suffering and Political Subjectivization], Anna Selmeczi, ''Journal of Asian and African Studies'', October 2012 vol. 47 no. 5 498-515&lt;/ref&gt; A politics of the poor is understood to mean a politics that is conducted by the poor and for the poor in a manner that enables the poor to be active participants in the struggles conducted in their name. Practically, it means that such a politics must be conducted where poor people live or in places that they can easily access, at the times when they are free, in the languages that they speak. It does not mean that middle-class people and organisations are excluded but that they are expected to come to these spaces and to undertake their politics there in a dialogical and democratic manner. There are two key aspects to the idea of a living politics. The first is that it is understood as a politics that begins not from external theory but from the experience of the people that shape it. It is argued that political education usually operates to create new elites who mediate relationships of [[patronage]] upwards and who impose ideas on others and to exclude ordinary people from thinking politically. This politics is not anti-theory – it just asserts the need to begin from lived experience and to move on from there rather than to begin from theory (usually imported from the [[Global North]]) and to impose theory on the lived experience of suffering and resistance in the shacks. The second key aspect, of a living politics, is that political thinking is always undertaken democratically and in common. People's politics is opposed to party politics or politicians' politics (as well as to top down undemocratic forms of NGO politics) and it is argued that the former is a popular democratic project undertaken without financial reward and with an explicit refusal of representative roles and personal power while the latter is a top down, professionalised representative project driven by personal power.&lt;ref&gt;The movement's philosophy is clearly articulated in a number of statements on its website – see, especially, the statements at http://abahlali.org/node/3208 It is also usefully summarised in the academic work by Nigel Gibson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpp.org.za/main.php?include=publications/critical_dialogue/vol2no1_2006/main.html&amp;menu=_menu/about.html&amp;title=Search] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328104242/http://www.cpp.org.za/main.php?include=publications%2Fcritical_dialogue%2Fvol2no1_2006%2Fmain.html&amp;menu=_menu%2Fabout.html&amp;title=Search |date=28 March 2012 }} Also see 'Taking poverty seriously: What the poor are saying and why it matters' by Xin Wei Ngiam in  Critical Dialogue, Vol.2, No.1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://davidharvey.org/2010/06/interface-journal-debates-david-harvey/] Educating resistance by Anna Anna Selmeczi in Debating David Harvey in Interface Journal (pp. 309 – 314), Volume 2 issue 1 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/ftinterface~content=a915734169~fulltext=713240930~frm=content] We are being left to burn because we do not count: Biopolitics, Abandonment, and Resistance by Anna Selmeczi in Global Society, Volume 23, Issue 4 October 2009 , pages 519 – 538&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that "Nearly 75% of South Africans aged 20-29 did not vote in the 2011 [local government] elections" and that "South Africans in that age group were more likely to have taken part in violent street protests against the local ANC than to have voted for the ruling party".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2013-01-29-deep-read-anc-risks-losing-born-free-voters Deep Read: 'Born free' voters may not choose ANC], JON HERSKOVITZ, ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 29 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy of Abahlali baseMjondolo with regards to elections can be summarised by the following statement from its elected president [[S'bu Zikode]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2010/09/07/slums-underground-economy-2020-opinions-contributors-robert-neuwirth.html Economies Go Underground][[Robert Neuwirth]], [[Forbes]], 09.09.10,&lt;/ref&gt; "The government and academics speak about the poor all the time, but so few want to speak to the poor...It becomes clear that our job is just to vote and then watch the rich speak about us as we get poorer".&lt;ref name="sundayherald.com"/&gt;

The movement's Deputy President, Lindela Figlan has argued that “Voting someone into government just gives them power to oppress and exploit us.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/opinion/be-angry-with-government-not-cops-1.1651036#.Uwh0-mKSx1V Be angry with government, not cops], Lee Rondganger, Lyse Comins and Nosipho Mngoma, ''The Daily News'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this sentiment, at the Abahlali baseMjondolo "Unfreedom Day" rally held in Kwa-Mashu on 27 April 2014, the movement's President Sbu Zikode announced that they "would abandon their No Land, No House, No Vote campaign and cast a “strategic vote” in the May 7 elections".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/we-will-vote-but-not-anc-abahlali-1.1681690#.U2PHX3V52Dc We will vote, but not ANC: Abahali], Nosipho Mngoma, ''The Daily News'', 29 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later Zikode signed a pact with the centrist [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA), stating that "We encourage our comrades and our membership to vote for the Democratic Alliance so that we can get rid of corruption".&lt;ref name="dailynews_02052014" /&gt; Zikode clarified that "Abahlali are not joining DA or any political party. We will remain independent from all kinds of mainstream political parties. But this time around it's a tactical partnership where the aim is to really get rid of the party that has become a threat to the society".&lt;ref name="ecn_02052014" /&gt; The DA welcomed Abahali's endorsement, stating that this had come after two years of engagement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.da.org.za/newsroom.htm?action=view-news-item&amp;id=13729 Abahlali Basemjondolo publicly endorse the DA for the elections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503000409/http://www.da.org.za/newsroom.htm?action=view-news-item&amp;id=13729 |date=3 May 2014 }} Sizwe Mchunu, DA Leader in KwaZulu-Natal, 2 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repression ==

In the early days of the movement, individuals in the ruling party often accused Abahlali of being criminals manipulated by a malevolent white man, a '[[Third Force (South Africa)|third force]]', or a foreign intelligence agency.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ncg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abahlali.org/node/17] Article by S'bu Zikode written in response to Third Force allegations&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church support==

The movement has received strong support from some key church leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiantoday.com/article/a.bishops.pursuit.of.justice.for.south.africas.shack.dwellers/26028.htm] A bishop's pursuit of justice for South Africa's shack dwellers, Emma Pomfret ''Christian Today''&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech at the AbM [[UnFreedom Day]] event on 27 April 2008 [[Anglican]] Bishop [[Rubin Phillip]] said that:

"The courage, dignity and gentle determination of Abahlali baseMjodolo has been a light that has shone ever more
brightly over the last three years. You have faced fires, sickness, evictions, arrest, beatings, slander, and still you stand bravely for what is true. Your principle that everyone matters, that every life is precious, is very simple but it is also utterly profound. Many of us who hold dear the most noble traditions of our country take hope from your courage and your dignity."&lt;ref&gt;The speech was printed in the May issue of 'Anglican News' and it can be downloaded at http://www.anglican.co.za/archives.htm{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

According to eThekwini City Manager Dr. Michael Sutcliffe, the essence of the tensions between Abahlali baseMjondolo and the City lie in the fact that the movement "rejects the authority of the city." When the Durban High Court ruled that his attempts to ban marches by Abahlali baseMjondolo were unlawful he stated that: "We will be asking serious questions of the court because we cannot allow anarchy having anyone marching at any time and any place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/munadmin/media/press/abmsa?searchterm=abahlali |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726122850/http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/munadmin/media/press/abmsa?searchterm=abahlali |archivedate=26 July 2011 }}, Press Statement by Sutcliffe&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lennox Mabaso, spokesperson for the Provincial Department of Housing, the movement is "under the sway of an agent provocateur" who is "engaged in clandestine operations" and who has been "assigned to provoke unrest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southafrica.indymedia.org/news/2006/10/11358.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319004325/http://southafrica.indymedia.org/news/2006/10/11358.php |archivedate=19 March 2009 }}, Sunday Tribune article by Mabaso&lt;/ref&gt; City Officials continue to argue that the movement is a [[Third force (South Africa)|Third Force]] seeking to undermine the ruling [[African National Congress]] for nefarious purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&amp;global&amp;#91;_id&amp;#93;=108219 ANC: ‘Abahlali and opposition a third force’], Mhlabunzima Memela, ''The Witness, 17 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1589">'''Central National Committee''' (Polish: ''Komitet Centralny Narodowy (KCN)'') was the underground coordinating committee of the [[Poland|Polish]] independence movement in 1860s [[Congress Poland]] which was responsible for preparing a general uprising against [[Russian Empire|Tsarist]] rule in order to reestablish Polish independence, lost after the [[Partitions of Poland]]. It represented the "Red", left wing, faction in the independence movement, which emphasized an end to [[serfdom]] without compensation to landlords as a necessary component of the Polish national struggle, as opposed to the "White" faction which advocated more moderate social reforms, while also supporting Polish independence.

The committee was organized in June 1862, in [[Warsaw]]. After establishing underground cells, levying a national [[tax]] to fund the upcoming insurrection and appointing a Polish police, it issued a manifesto for the beginning of what became the [[January Uprising]] against the [[Russian Empire]]. Thereafter it transformed itself into the [[Polish National Government (January Uprising)|Provisional National Government/Polish National Government]] of Poland (on January 22, 1863).

Its main leaders included [[Stefan Bobrowski]], [[Jarosław Dąbrowski]], [[Zygmunt Padlewski]], [[Agaton Giller]], and [[Bronisław Szwarce]]. The official publication of the committee was the newspaper ''"Ruch"''.

'''FDX''', short for '''Fast Data eXchange''' is a proprietary maritime communication protocol by Nexus Marine AB.

It describes how data points from sensors are to be sent across an RS485 serial bus to displays. FDX was originally developed in the 1990s, and is now mostly seen as a legacy protocol. The GND10 gateway from Garmin translates FDX into [[NMEA 2000]], to be able to continue using Nexus sensors on more recent [[NMEA 2000]] networks.

'''Gerulata''' was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[military camp]] located near today's [[Rusovce]], a borough of [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]. It was part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Pannonia]] and was built in the 2nd century as a part of the [[Limes Romanus|frontier defence]] system. It was abandoned in the 4th century, when Roman legions withdrew from [[Pannonia]].

Today there is a museum, which is part of the [[Bratislava City Museum]].

Archaeologists have unearthed its remnants and their discoveries are on exhibition in the hall of the museum, which is open in summer and can be near the Church of St Mary Magdalene in the town.
Beyond the remains of the Roman forum, fragments of structures and gravestones, bronze, iron, ceramic and stone pieces are on show in a museum showing daily life.

The best preserved object is a quadrilateral building 30 metres long and 30 metres wide, with 2.4 metre thick walls.

'''Ghazni Airport''' ({{lang-ps|د غزني هوايي ډګر}}; {{airport codes|GZI|OAGN|p=n}}) is located in [[Ghazni]], Afghanistan, next to the main [[Kabul–Kandahar Highway|Ghazni-Kandahar Highway]].&lt;ref&gt;http://goo.gl/maps/1IgrN&lt;/ref&gt; It serves the population of [[Ghazni Province|Ghazni]] and other nearby [[Provinces of Afghanistan|Afghan provinces]]. The airport is mainly used for civilian flights and is still being developed as of late 2013.&lt;ref name=PAN&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2013/12/28/7m-ghazni-civil-airport-inaugurated | title = $7m Ghazni civil airport inaugurated | publisher = [[Pajhwok Afghan News]] | date = 28 December 2013|accessdate = 28 December 2013|first = Saifullah |last = Maftoon }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was formerly a [[military airfield]] until the [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan government]] recently decided to turn it into an international airport. It currently has one [[runway]] designated 15/33 with a length of {{convert|1000|ft|0}}.&lt;ref name="MOTCA" /&gt;

The government plans to add two runways in the near future. The overall project is expected to be completed in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2013/07/02/work-ghazni-airport-launched | title = Work on Ghazni airport launched | publisher = Pajhwok Afghan News | date = 2 July 2013|accessdate = 5 July 2013|first = Saifullah |last = Maftoon }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase of the project was inaugurated in late December 2013 after a smaller private aircraft landed at the runway of Ghazni Airport.&lt;ref name=PAN/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2718">The International Centre for Migration, Health and Development (ICMHD) is a Swiss-based non-profit organization based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. It is a research, training and policy centre founded in 1995 with the purpose of improving, protecting and advocating for the health and welfare of people on the move. ICMHD is a [[WHO]] Collaborating Centre for Health-Related Issues Among People Displaced by Disasters and a [[UNFPA]] Implementing Partner. It also works with other UN agencies as well as with universities and research and training institutions throughout the world.

ICMHD’s mandate is to provide governments, UN agencies, NGOs and other parties with information and technical support on how the movement of people affects, and is affected by health and social conditions, and how this dynamic can be best managed to the benefit of everyone concerned. 
The work of ICMHD is predicated on the fact that the right to health must apply to all people, including migrants, refugees and others who find themselves on the move for political, environmental, social and economic reasons. ICMHD believes that in protecting the health and welfare of people on the move, the public health and security of the larger society is also strengthened. 
The work of ICMHD covers all types of population movement, including economically motivated migration (documented and undocumented), forced migration (environmental and political), nomadic migration, and the movement of uniformed service groups such as peacekeepers and military personnel. From the perspective of health, health care and health systems, ICMHD addresses non-communicable, communicable and parasitic diseases. ICMHD is currently working on research, training and policy options in the areas of HIV/AIDS, TB, viral hepatitis, diabetes, malaria, reproductive health and psycho-social impacts of uprooting. It is also addressing the question of health care worker migration and alternative approaches to preventing excess brain drain from developing countries.

&lt;br /&gt;The Executive Committee is composed of Dr. Eamon Kelly (president), Dr Mohamed-Lardi Abdelmoumene (vice-president), Professor [[Monique Bégin]] (treasurer), and [[Manuel Carballo (Epidemiologist)|Dr. Manuel Carballo]] (executive director).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2324">'''Kastrup Glasværk''' was a Danish glasworks located in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. Kastrup Glasværk was also the parent company of Hellerup Glasværk, De forenede Glasværker in [[Odense]] and Aarhus Glasværk in [[Aarhus]].

==History==
Kastrup Glasværk was founded on 12 October 1847 by Christian Conrad Sophus Danneskiold-Samsøe. He has inherited [[Holmegård]] glasworks at [[Næstved]] after his mother in 1943. The company was converted into an [[aktieselskab]] in 1873. In 1881, the company acquired Tuborg Fabrikers Glasværk whouse name was subsequently changed to Hellerup Glasværk. In 1883, the company also took over Godthaab Glasværk in [[Helsingør]]. In 1907, Kastrup Glasværk acquired A/S De forenede Glasværker in [[Odense]] and Frederiksberg Glasværk. A/S De forenede Glasværker comprised Fyns Glasværk in Odense (founded on 11 June 1874) and Aarhus Glasværk in [[Aarhus]] (founded 1898). In 1918, Aalborg Glasværk in [[Aalborg]] (founded in 1853) was acquired. 

In 1865, Kastrup Glasværk merged with Holmegaard under the nameKastrup og Holmegaards Glasværker A/S. The principal shareholders were [[Carlsberg Group]], [[De forende Bryggerier]] and Elisabeth Lassen who had inherited Holmegaard after her father (count Aage Danneskiold-Samsøe( in 1945. The merged company had about 1,935 employeesThe and a total production of about 102,000 tonnes. The production ceased in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardernet.dk/Glasswork/Kastrup_Glasvaerk_1847-1979.htm|title=KKastrup Glasværk, 1847-1879|language=Danish|website=hardernet.dk|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Headquarters==
Kastrup Glasværk was from 1892 headquartered at [[Nørre Voldgade]] 12 in central Copenhagen. The Historicist building was designed by the architect [[Philip Smidth]]. The company name is still seen on the facade. The building is now home to Teknisk Landsforbund.

Kastrup Glasværk was initially a manufacturer of bottles. The production was automatized in 1912. The company later also began to manufacture other products such as drinking glass, tableware, flasks, bell jars and light fictures.

Their spread straddles both the [[equator]] and the [[180th meridian]], although the [[International Date Line]] goes round Kiribati and swings far to the east, almost reaching the [[150th meridian west|150°W meridian]]. This brings the [[Line Islands]] into the same day as the Kiribati Islands. Kiribati's easternmost islands, the southern Line Islands, south of [[Hawaii]], have the most advanced time on Earth: [[UTC+14:00|UTC+14]] hours.

Kiribati became independent from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1979. The capital and now most populated area, [[South Tarawa]], consists of a number of islets, connected by a series of [[causeway]]s. These comprise about half the area of [[Tarawa]] Atoll.

Kiribati is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and the [[World Bank]], and became a full member of the [[United Nations]] in 1999.

==Etymology&lt;!--linked--&gt;==
The name ''Kiribati'' was adopted at independence. It is the local enunciation of ''Gilberts''. This name derives from the main archipelago that forms the nation. It was named the [[Gilbert Islands]] after the British explorer [[Thomas Gilbert (sea captain)|Thomas Gilbert]]. He sighted many of the islands in 1788 while mapping out the Outer Passage route from [[Port Jackson]] to [[Guangzhou|Canton]].&lt;ref name=LifeMagazine1944-05-22&gt;

The Kiribati archipelago was named ''Îles Gilbert'' (''Gilbert Islands'' in English), in about 1820, by Russian admiral [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|Adam von Krusenstern]] and French captain [[Louis Isidore Duperrey|Louis Duperrey]]. Both their maps, published in 1820, were written in French. In English, the archipelago was often referred to as the Kingsmills in the 19th century, although the name Gilbert Islands was used increasingly, including in the

The name Gilbert was incorporated into the name of the entire [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony]] from 1916, and was retained after the Ellice Islands became the separate nation of [[Tuvalu]] in 1976. The spelling of ''Gilberts'' in the [[Gilbertese language]] as Kiribati may be found in books in Gilbertese prepared by missionaries and others (see e.g. Hawaiian Board of Missionaries, 1895).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hawaiian board of missions, publishers|title=Te Rikitianere ni baibara, ae te boki ni kaoti nanon taeka ianena aika 376 aika n te baibara ni kiribati: ma te kankaotanti ae karako.

It is often suggested that the indigenous name for the Gilbert Islands proper is ''Tungaru'' (see e.g. [[Arthur Grimble]], 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Grimble| first = Arthur| authorlink = Arthur Grimble| title = Tungaru traditions: writings on the atoll culture of the Gilbert Islands|publisher = University of Hawaii Press|series = Penguin Travel Library| year = 1989 | url = | isbn = 978-0-8248-1217-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, the name Kiribati was chosen as the name of the new independent nation by local consensus, on such grounds that it was modern{{clarify|date=November 2017}},&lt;ref name=cind/&gt; and to acknowledge the inclusion of islands (e.g. [[Phoenix Islands|the Phoenix Group]] and [[Line Islands]]), which were never considered part of the Tungaru (or Gilberts) chain.&lt;ref&gt;Sabatier, Ernest. ''Dictionnaire gilbertin-français'' Tabuiroa, 1954 says that ''Kiribati'' is already the meaning for all the Gilberts District of GEIC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The pronunciation differs: ''Kiribas'' is the official pronunciation as ''ti'' in the Gilbertese language makes an ''s'' sound.

===Early history===
The area now called Kiribati has been inhabited by [[Micronesia]]ns speaking the same [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic language]] since sometime between 3000 BC&lt;ref name=cind&gt;Macdonald, Barrie (2001) ''Cinderellas of the Empire: towards a history of Kiribati and Tuvalu'', Institute of Pacific Studies, [[University of the South Pacific]], Suva, Fiji, {{ISBN|982-02-0335-X}}, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and AD 1300.&lt;ref name=t5&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], 5&lt;/ref&gt; The area was not isolated; invaders from [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], and [[Fiji]], later introduced [[Polynesia]]n and [[Melanesia]]n cultural aspects, respectively. Intermarriage tended to blur cultural differences and resulted in a significant degree of cultural homogenisation.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091014051525/http://www.mfep.gov.ki/Facts%20and%20Background.htm Background Note: Kiribati]. mfep.gov.ki&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial era===
Chance visits by European ships occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Maude, H. E.|author2= Heyen, G. H. |year=1959|title= Spanish Discoveries in the Central Pacific: A Study in Identification|journal= The Journal of the Polynesian Society|volume =68|issue=4 |pages= 285–326|url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document//Volume_68_1959/Volume_68,_No._4/Spanish_discoveries_in_the_Pacific,_by_H._E._Maude,_p_285-326/p1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Maude, H.

A passing trade, whaling the On-The-Line grounds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Best, P. B. |year=1983|title=Sperm whale stock assessments and the relevance of historical whaling records|journal=Report of the International Whaling Commission |volume=Special Issue 5|pages= 41–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and labour trade ships visited the islands in large numbers during the 19th century with social, economic, political, religious and cultural consequences, good, bad and indifferent.&lt;ref name=cind/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geddes, W.

Atoll economy: Social change in Kiribati and Tuvalu, No. 1, Canberra: Australian National University, Development Studies Centre.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passing trade gave rise to European, Chinese, Samoan and other residents from the 1830s: they included beachcombers, castaways, traders and missionaries. In 1892 local authorities (uea, atun te boti) on each of the Gilbert Islands agreed to Captain Davis RN declaring them part of a [[British Empire|British]] protectorate with the nearby [[Ellice Islands]]. They were administered by a resident commissioner based in [[Butaritari]] (1893–95), [[Tarawa]] (1896–1908) and [[Banaba Island|Banaba]] (1908–1941), who was under the Western Pacific High Commission based in Fiji.&lt;ref name=BBCtimeline&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/country_profiles/2944816.stm |title = BBC Timeline:Kiribati |accessdate = 29 July 2008 |publisher = BBC |date = 15 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Banaba Island|Banaba]], known to Europeans as Ocean Island, was added to the protectorate in 1900.

The conduct of W. Telfer Campbell, the resident commissioner of the Gilberts of 1896 to 1908, was criticised as to his legislative, judicial and administrative management (including allegations of forced labour exacted from islanders) and became the subject of the 1909 report by Arthur Mahaffy.&lt;ref name="AM1909"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Mahaffy |first1= Arthur |authorlink1= |title= Report by Mr. Arthur Mahaffy on a visit to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands |accessdate=  |year=1910|publisher= Great Britain, Colonial Office, High Commission for Western Pacific Islands (London: His Majesty's Stationery Office)|location= |language= |isbn=|oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=|chapter=(CO 225/86/26804)|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2367/ |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 an anonymous correspondent to the New Age journal described the mis-administration of W. Telfer Campbell and questioned the partiality of Arthur Mahaffy as he was a former colonial official in the Gilberts.&lt;ref name="AN"&gt;{{cite journal|first=|last= Correspondent |title = Modern buccaneers in the West Pacific |url= http://dl.lib.brown.edu/pdfs/1140814207532014.pdf |date= 5 June 1913|volume=  |issue=|journal= New Age |pages=136–140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The anonymous correspondent also criticised the operations of the Pacific Phosphate Company on Ocean Island.&lt;ref name="AN"/&gt;

The islands became the [[crown colony]] of the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] in 1916.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; The Line Islands, including Christmas Island (later spelled [[Kiritimati]]) and [[Fanning Island]] (Tabuaeran), were added to the colony in 1919 and the [[Phoenix Islands]] were added in 1937.

[[File:Flag of Gilbert and Ellice Islands.svg|thumb|left|Colonial flag of [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]]]]
Sir [[Arthur Grimble]] was a cadet administrative officer based at [[Tarawa]] (1913–1919) and became Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony in 1926.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite book |last = Grimble |first = Sir Arthur |title = A Pattern of Islands |year = 1952 |publisher = [[Early New Zealand Books]] (NZETC) |url = http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-GriPatt.html |accessdate = 16 October 2011 |isbn = 978-1-906011-45-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, the Pacific Cable Board laid the first trans-Pacific telegraph cable from [[Bamfield]], British Columbia to [[Fanning Island]] (Tabuaeran) in the Line Islands and from Fiji to Fanning Island, thus completing the [[All Red Line]], a series of telegraph lines circumnavigating the globe completely within the British Empire. The location of Fanning Island, one of the closest formations to Hawaii, led to its annexation by the British Empire in 1888. Nearby candidates including Palmyra Island were disfavored due to the lack of adequate landing sites.

The United States eventually incorporated the Northern Line into its territories and did the same with the Phoenix Islands which lie between Kiribati and the Line Islands including Howland, Jarvis, and Baker islands, thus, bringing about a territorial dispute. This was eventually resolved and they became part of Kiribati as part of the [[Treaty of Tarawa]]. This was signed shortly after independence and ratified in 1983, the United States relinquishing all claims to the sparsely inhabited Phoenix Islands and those of the Line Islands that are part of Kiribati territory.

[[File:Tarawa.jpg|thumb|American Marines assault a Japanese bunker during the [[Battle of Tarawa]], November 1943.]]
[[Tarawa Atoll]] and others of the Gilbert group were occupied by Japan from 1941 to 1943 during World War II. Betio became an airfield and supply base. The expulsion of the Japanese military in late 1943 involved one of the bloodiest battles in US Marine Corps history. Marines landed in November 1943 and the [[Battle of Tarawa]] ensued.

Further military operations in the colony occurred in the late 1950s and early 1960s when [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] was used by the United States and United Kingdom for [[nuclear weapons testing]] including [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bombs]].

Institutions of internal self-rule were established on Tarawa from about 1967. The Ellice Islands were separated from the rest of the colony in 1975 and granted their own internal self-rule institutions. In 1978 the Ellice Islands became the independent nation of [[Tuvalu]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Ridgell, Reilly (1995) ''Pacific Nations and Territories: The Islands of Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia''. 3rd Edition.

===Independence===
The Gilbert Islands gained independence as the Republic of Kiribati on 12 July 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/oceania/ki.htm|title=Kiribati Map and Information, Map of Kiribati, Facts, Figures and Geography of Kiribati -Worldatlas.com - WorldAtlas.com|website=www.worldatlas.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States gave up most of the [[Line Islands]] and recognised Kiribati in [[Treaty of Tarawa|1983]]. Kiribati received Canton Island, Enderbury Island, Birnie Island, Mckean Island, Rawaki, Manra, Orona, and Nikumaroro from the Phoenix Islands; and Teraina, Tabuaeran, Kiritimati, Malden Island, Starbuck Island, Caroline Islands, Vostok Islands and Flint Island from the Line Islands.

Although the indigenous [[Gilbertese language]] name for the Gilbert Islands proper is "Tungaru", the new state chose the name "Kiribati", the I-Kiribati enunciation of "Gilberts", as an equivalent of the former colony to acknowledge the inclusion of [[Banaba Island|Banaba]], the [[Line Islands]], and the [[Phoenix Islands]]. The last two of these were never occupied by I-Kiribati{{clarify|date=March 2018}} until the British authorities, and later the Republic Government, resettled I-Kiribati there under resettlement schemes.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In the post-independence era, [[overcrowding]] has been a problem, at least in British and aid organisations' eyes. In 1988, an announcement was made that 4,700 residents of the main island group would be resettled onto less-populated islands.
 
[[Teburoro Tito]] was elected president in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/kiribati/history|title=Kiribati : History {{!}} The Commonwealth|last=(http://www.hydrant.co.uk)|first=Site designed and built by Hydrant|website=thecommonwealth.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Kiribati unilaterally moved the [[international date line]] far to the east to encompass the Line Islands group, so that the nation would no longer be divided by the date line. The move, which fulfilled one of President Tito's campaign promises, was intended to allow businesses across the expansive nation to keep the same business week. This also enabled Kiribati to become the first country to see the dawn of the [[third millennium]], an event of significance for tourism. Tito was re-elected in 1998. Kiribati gained UN membership in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.un.org/webcast/ga/58/statements/kirieng031001.htm |title = Kiribati |publisher = United Nations |date = 1 October 2003 |accessdate = 14 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Kiribati passed a controversial law that enabled the government to shut down newspapers. The legislation followed the launching of Kiribati's first successful non-government-run newspaper. President Tito was re-elected in 2003 but was removed from office in March 2003 by a no-confidence vote and replaced by a Council of State. [[Anote Tong]] of the opposition party [[Boutokaan Te Koaua]] was elected to succeed Tito in July 2003. He was re-elected in 2007 and in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.electionguide.org/country.php?ID=113 |title = IFES Election Guide – Country Profile: Kiribati |publisher = Electionguide.org |accessdate = 14 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, Kiribati officials asked Australia and New Zealand to accept Kiribati citizens as permanent refugees. Kiribati is expected to be the first country to lose all its land territory to [[global warming]]. In June 2008, the Kiribati President Anote Tong said that the country has reached "the point of no return." He added, "To plan for the day when you no longer have a country is indeed painful but I think we have to do that."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080605183737/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/06/05/asia/AS-GEN-New-Zealand-World-Environment-Day.php "Leader of disappearing island nation says climate change an issue of survival, not economics"], the Associated Press, 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=3002001&amp;page=1 "Kiribati's President: 'Our Lives Are At Stake': For the Islands of Kiribati, Global Warming Poses Immediate Dangers"], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 2 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Kathy (6 June 2008) [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/paradise-lost-climate-change-forces-south-sea-islanders-to-seek-sanctuary-abroad-841409.html "Paradise lost: climate change forces South Sea islanders to seek sanctuary abroad"], ''The Independent''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nair, Suchit (6 June 2008) [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-06-06/us/27767721_1_climate-change-achim-steiner-r-k-pachauri "Tiny atoll in Pacific cries out for help"], ''The Times of India''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kiribati Constitution, promulgated 12 July 1979, provides for free and open elections. The executive branch consists of a president (''te Beretitenti''), a vice-president and a cabinet. The president, who is also chief of the cabinet, is elected from the legislature and is limited to three four-year terms. He remains a member of the Assembly while serving as president. The cabinet is composed of the president, vice-president, and 10 ministers (appointed by the president) who are also members of the House of Assembly.

The legislative branch is the unicameral ''Maneaba Ni Maungatabu'' (House of Assembly). It has elected members, including by constitutional mandate a representative of the Banaban people in [[Fiji]] (Banaba Island, former Ocean Island), in addition to the attorney general, who serves as an ''ex-officio'' member. Legislators serve for a four-year term.

The constitutional provisions governing administration of justice are similar to those in other former British possessions in that the judiciary is free from governmental interference. The judicial branch is made up of the High Court (in Betio) and the Court of Appeal. The president appoints the presiding judges.

Local government is through island councils with elected members. Local affairs are handled in a manner similar to town meetings in colonial America. Island councils make their own estimates of revenue and expenditure and generally are free from central government controls. There are a total of 21 inhabited islands in Kiribati. Each inhabited island has its own council. Since independence, Kiribati is no longer divided into districts (see [[Districts of Kiribati|Subdivisions of Kiribati]]).

Kiribati has formal political parties but their organisation is quite informal. Ad&amp;nbsp;hoc opposition groups tend to coalesce around specific issues. Today the only recognisable parties are the ''Boutokaan te Koaua'' Party, ''Maneaban te Mauri'' Party, ''Maurin Kiribati'' Party and ''Tabomoa'' Party. There is universal suffrage at age 18.

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Kiribati}}

Kiribati maintains close relations with its Pacific neighbours, Australia, New Zealand, Republic of China (Taiwan), Japan and Fiji. The first three of these provide the majority of the country's foreign aid. [[Taiwan]] and Japan also have specified-period licences to fish in Kiribati's waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Background Notes: Kiribati, May 1996|url=https://1997-2001.state.gov/background_notes/kiribati_0596_bgn.html|publisher=U.S. State Department|year=1996|accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four resident diplomatic missions headquartered in Kiribati: the Embassies of the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) and Cuba and the High Commissions of [[List of Australian High Commissioners to Kiribati|Australia]] and New Zealand.

In November 1999 Kiribati agreed to allow Japan's [[National Space Development Agency]] to lease land on Christmas Island for 20 years, on which to build a [[spaceport]].&lt;ref name=SpaceDaily2000&gt;{{cite news |title=Kiribati Gives Okay to Christmas Island Spaceport |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/japan-hopex-00d.html |newspaper=Space Daily News |date=11 May 2000 |accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement stipulated that Japan was to pay US$840,000 per year and would also pay for any damage to roads and the environment.&lt;ref name=SpaceDaily2000 /&gt; A Japanese-built downrange [[tracking station]] operates on Kiritimati&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fdsn.org/station_book/IU/XMAS/xmas.html |title=FDSN Station Info – XMAS |publisher = Fdsn.org |date=22 August 1997 |accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an abandoned airfield on the island was designated as the landing strip for a proposed reusable unmanned [[space shuttle]] called [[HOPE-X]]. HOPE-X, however, was eventually cancelled by Japan in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceindustry.com.au/Documents/nb2016-06.pdf |title=Cancelled Projects: HOPE and HOPE-X |last=Herman |first=Jos |date=June 2016 |newspaper=Tiros Space Information News Bulletin |volume=41 |number=9 |page=2 |location=Australia |accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the world's most vulnerable nations to the [[effects of global warming]], Kiribati has been an active participant in international diplomatic efforts relating to climate change, most importantly the [[UNFCCC]] conferences of the parties (COP). Kiribati is a member of the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS), an intergovernmental organisation of low-lying coastal and small island countries. Established in 1990, the main purpose of the alliance is to consolidate the voices of [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDS) to address global warming. AOSIS has been very active from its inception, putting forward the first draft text in the [[Kyoto Protocol]] negotiations as early as 1994.

In 2009, President Tong attended the [[Climate Vulnerable Forum]] ([[Climate Vulnerable Forum|V11]]) in the [[Maldives]], with 10 other countries that are vulnerable to climate change, and signed the Bandos Island declaration on 10 November 2009, pledging to show moral leadership and commence greening their economies by voluntarily committing to achieving [[carbon neutrality]].

In November 2010, Kiribati hosted the [[Tarawa Climate Change Conference]] (TCCC) to support the president of Kiribati's initiative to hold a consultative forum between vulnerable states and their partners. The conference strove to create an enabling environment for multi-party negotiations under the auspices of the UNFCCC. The conference was a successor event to the Climate Vulnerable Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climate.gov.ki/tarawa_climate_change_conference.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202030155/http://www.climate.gov.ki/tarawa_climate_change_conference.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 February 2012 |title=Climate Change in Kiribati, Tarawa Climate Change Conference Issues Ambo Declaration |publisher=Office of the President of Kiribati |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate objective of TCCC was to reduce the number and intensity of fault lines between parties to the COP process, explore elements of agreement between the parties and thereby to support Kiribati's and other parties' contribution to [[COP16]] held in [[Cancun]], [[Mexico]], from 29 November to 10 December 2010.

In 2013, President Tong has spoken of climate-change induced sea level rise as "inevitable". "For our people to survive, then they will have to migrate. Either we can wait for the time when we have to move people en masse or we can prepare them—beginning from now ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Lagan |first = Bernard |title = Australia urged to formally recognise climate change refugee status |url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/16/australia-climate-change-refugee-status |accessdate = 29 April 2013 |newspaper = The Guardian |date = 16 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York in 2014, per ''[[The New Yorker]]'', President Tong told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "according to the projections, within this century, the water will be higher than the highest point in our lands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/president-tong-and-his-disappearing-islands|title=President Tong and His Disappearing Islands|author=Betsy Morais|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=June 8, 2014|accessdate=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, President Tong finalized the purchase of a 20&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; stretch of land on Vanua Levu, one of the larger Fiji islands, 2,000&amp;nbsp;km away. A move described by Tong as an "absolute necessity" should the nation be completely submerged under water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/01/kiribati-climate-change-fiji-vanua-levu|title=Besieged by the rising tides of climate change, Kiribati buys land in Fiji|last=Caramel|first=Laurence|date=2014-06-30|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 attention was drawn to a claim of a Kiribati man of being a [[Environmental migrant#In Asia &amp; the Pacific|"climate change refugee"]] under the [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] (1951).&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web| title= Pacific Islander Ioane Teitiota fails in bid to be first climate change refugee| publisher= ABC News|date=27 November 2013|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-26/kiribati-ioane-teitoa-refugee-new-zealand-climate-change/5117848|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this claim was determined by the New Zealand High Court to be untenable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vernonrive.co.nz/PointSource/Climate_refugees_revisited_a_closer_look_at_the_Tuvalu_deci.aspx |title='Climate refugees' revisited: a closer look at the Tuvalu decision |publisher=Point Source |date=14 August 2014 |quote= |author=Vernon Rive |accessdate=11 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211073607/http://www.vernonrive.co.nz/PointSource/Climate_refugees_revisited_a_closer_look_at_the_Tuvalu_deci.aspx |archivedate=11 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand Court of Appeal also rejected the claim in a [[Teitiota v Chief Executive Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment|2014 decision]]. On further appeal the New Zealand Supreme Court confirmed the earlier adverse rulings against the application for refugee status, but rejected the proposition “that environmental degradation resulting from climate change or other natural disasters could never create a pathway into the Refugee Convention or protected person jurisdiction.”&lt;ref name="TSC"&gt;{{cite web| work= NZLII |title= Teitiota v Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment [2015] NZSC 107 (20 July 2015) [13]|url= http://www.nzlii.org/nz/cases/NZSC/2015/107.html| accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law enforcement and military===
[[Law enforcement in Kiribati]] is carried out by the Kiribati Police Service which is responsible for all law enforcement and paramilitary duties for the island nation. There are police posts located on all of the islands. The police have one patrol boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.hazegray.org/worldnav/asiapac/asiapac.htm#5 |title = Pacific Forum class patrol boat |publisher = Hazegray.org |date = 25 March 2002 |accessdate = 14 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiribati has no military and relies on both [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] for its defence.

The main prison in Kiribati is located in [[Betio]], named the Walter Betio Prison. There is also a prison in Ronton (London) on Kiritimati Island.

=== Administrative divisions ===
[[File:CarolinePic-Kepler-Long.JPG|thumb|[[Line Islands]]: [[Caroline Atoll]] channel between west side of Long Island and Nake Island.]]
[[File:Marakei Atoll.jpg|thumb|[[Marakei]] Atoll, North Gilbert Islands]]
{{Main|Districts of Kiribati}}
There are a total of 21 inhabited islands in Kiribati. Kiribati is divided geographically into three island groups, including a group that unites the [[Line Islands]] and the [[Phoenix Islands]] (ministry at [[London, Kiribati|London]], [[Kiritimati]] Island). The groups have no administrative function.  They are:
* [[Gilbert Islands]]
* [[Phoenix Islands]], in one of the [[List of largest protected areas in the world|largest marine protected areas]] on Earth (was largest from 2008 to 2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSSP231103 |title = Kiribati creates world's largest marine reserve |agency = Reuters |date = 14 February 2008 |accessdate = 14 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Line Islands]].

The original districts before independence were:
* [[Banaba Island|Banaba]]
* [[Tarawa Atoll]]
* [[Northern Gilbert Islands]]
* [[Central Gilbert Island]]
* [[South Gilbert Islands|Southern Gilbert Islands]]
* [[Line Islands]]

Four of the former districts (including Tarawa) lie in the Gilbert Islands, where most of the country's population lives. Five of the Line Islands are uninhabited ([[Malden Island]], [[Starbuck Island]], [[Caroline Island]], [[Vostok Island]] and [[Flint Island]]). The Phoenix Islands are uninhabited except for [[Kanton Island|Kanton]], and have no representation. Banaba itself is sparsely inhabited now. There is also a non-elected representative of the Banabans on [[Rabi Island]] in Fiji.

Each of the 21 inhabited islands&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; has its own local council that takes care of daily affairs. There is one council for each inhabited island, with two exceptions: Tarawa Atoll has three councils: [[Betio]] Town Council, Te Inainano Urban Council (for the rest of [[South Tarawa]]) and Eutan Tarawa Council (for North Tarawa); and [[Tabiteuea]] has two councils.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Kiribati}}
[[File:Kiribati map LOC.jpg|right|thumb|A map of Kiribati.]]
[[File:Abaiang top view.jpg|right|thumb|Coconut palms in Abaiang]]

Kiribati consists of [[List of islands of Kiribati|32]] atolls and one solitary island ([[Banaba Island|Banaba]]), extending into the eastern and western hemispheres, as well as the northern and southern hemispheres. It is the only country that is situated within all four hemispheres.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; The groups of islands are:
* [[Banaba Island|Banaba]]: an isolated island between [[Nauru]] and the Gilbert Islands
* [[Gilbert Islands]]: 16 atolls located some {{convert|1500|km|mi|0}} north of [[Fiji]]
* [[Phoenix Islands]]: 8 atolls and coral islands located some {{convert|1800|km|mi|0}} southeast of the Gilberts
* [[Line Islands]]: 8 atolls and one reef, located about {{convert|3300|km|mi|0}} east of the Gilberts

Banaba (or Ocean Island) is a [[Raised coral atoll|raised-coral island]]. It was once a rich source of [[phosphate]]s, but was exhausted in mining before independence.&lt;ref name="WM1985"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Maslyn Williams &amp; Barrie Macdonald|title= The Phosphateers |year=1985|publisher= Melbourne University Press  |isbn=0-522-84302-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis 1935"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Ellis |first1= Albert F. |authorlink1= Albert Fuller Ellis |title= Ocean Island and Nauru; Their Story |url= |accessdate=  |year= 1935 |publisher= Angus and Robertson, limited|location= Sydney, Australia |language= |isbn= |oclc= 3444055 |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the land in Kiribati consists of the sand and reef rock islets of atolls or coral islands, which rise only one or two metres above sea level.

The soil is thin and [[calcareous]]. It has a low water-holding capacity and low organic matter and nutrient content—except for calcium, sodium, and magnesium. Banaba is one of the least suitable places for agriculture in the world.&lt;ref name=t3/&gt;

[[Kiritimati]] (Christmas Island) in the Line Islands is the world's largest atoll. Based on a 1995 realignment of the [[International Date Line]], the Line Islands were the first area to enter into a new year, including year 2000. For that reason, [[Caroline Island]] has been renamed [[Millennium Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Harris, Aimee |date = April 1999 |title = Millennium: Date Line Politics |work = Honolulu Magazine |url = http://www.trussel.com/kir/dateline.htm |accessdate = 14 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Kiribati, including the capital, is not first, for example New Zealand (UTC+13 in January) has an earlier new year.

=== Environmental issues ===

According to the [[Pacific Regional Environment Programme]] (previously South Pacific Regional Environment Programme), two small uninhabited Kiribati islets, [[Tebua Tarawa]] and [[Abanuea]], disappeared underwater in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/368892.stm |title = Islands disappear under rising seas |publisher = BBC News |date = 14 June 1999 |access-date = 14 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] predicts that sea levels will rise by about 50&amp;nbsp;cm (20&amp;nbsp;in) by 2100 due to [[global warming]] and a further rise would be inevitable. It is thus likely that within a century the nation's arable land will become subject to increased [[soil salination]] and will be largely submerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/28/AR2006012801021.html |work = The Washington Post |title = Debate on Climate Shifts to Issue of Irreparable Change |first = Juliet |last = Eilperin |date = 29 January 2006 |access-date = 7 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exposure of Kiribati to changes in sea levels is exacerbated by the [[Pacific decadal oscillation]], which is a climate switch phenomenon that results in changes from periods of [[La Niña]] to periods of [[El Niño]]. This has an effect on sea levels. For example, in 2000 there was a switch from periods of downward pressure of El Niño on sea levels to an upward pressure of La Niña on sea levels, which upward pressure causes more frequent and higher high tide levels. The [[Perigean spring tide]] (often called a [[king tide]]) can result in seawater flooding low-lying areas of the islands of Kiribati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Packard | first =Aaron | title= The Unfolding Crisis in Kiribati and the Urgency of Response| publisher= HuffPostGreen|date=12 March 2015 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/aaron-packard/the-unfolding-crisis-in-kiribati-and-the-urgency-of-response_b_6854386.html |accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Onotoa.png|thumb|South of [[Onotoa]] Atoll]]
[[File:South Tarawa from the air.jpg|thumb|[[Tarawa Atoll]]]]

The [[atolls]] and [[reef]] islands can respond to changes in sea-level. Paul Kench at the [[University of Auckland]] in New Zealand and Arthur Webb at the [[South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission]] in Fiji released a study in 2010 on the dynamic response of atolls and reef islands in the central Pacific. Kiribati was mentioned in the study, and Webb and Kench found that the three major urbanised islands in Kiribati—Betio, Bairiki and Nanikai—increased by 30% (36 hectares), 16.3% (5.8 hectares) and 12.5% (0.8 hectares), respectively.&lt;ref name="WZ"&gt;{{cite book |author = Zukerman, Wendy |title = Shape-shifting islands defy sea-level rise |date = 2 June 2010 |publisher = New Scientist Magazine; issue 2763 |url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20627633.700-shapeshifting-islands-defy-sealevel-rise.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsevier"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Webb |first1 = A.P. |last2 = Kench |first2 = P.S. |year = 2010 |title = The dynamic response of reef islands to sea-level rise: Evidence from multi-decadal analysis of island change in the Central Pacific |journal = Global and Planetary Change |publisher = Elsevier |doi = 10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.05.003 |url = http://www.pacificdisaster.net/pdnadmin/data/original/SOPAC_2010_The_dynamic_response.pdf |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121222070018/http://www.pacificdisaster.net/pdnadmin/data/original/SOPAC_2010_The_dynamic_response.pdf |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 22 December 2012 |access-date = 22 July 2013 |bibcode = 2010GPC....72..234W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PSK2014"&gt;{{cite web| last = Kench | first =Paul |title= Dynamic atolls give hope that Pacific Islands can defy sea rise | publisher= The Conversation|chapter=|date =|url= http://theconversation.com/dynamic-atolls-give-hope-that-pacific-islands-can-defy-sea-rise-25436 | access-date=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AWPK"&gt;{{cite journal|first= |last= Arthur P.

The study by Paul Kench and Arthur Webb recognises that the islands are extremely vulnerable to sea level rise, and concluded that: "This study did not measure vertical growth of the island surface nor does it suggest there is any change in the height of the islands. Since land height has not changed the vulnerability of the greater part of the land area of each island to submergence due to sea level rise is also unchanged and these low-lying atolls remain immediately and extremely vulnerable to inundation or sea water flooding."&lt;ref name="Elsevier"/&gt;

The Climate Change in the Pacific Report of 2011 describes Kiribati as having a low risk of [[cyclones]];&lt;ref name="CCP2ch6"&gt;{{cite book|title= Climate Change in the Pacific: Volume 2: Country Reports|year=2011 |publisher= Pacific Climate Change Science Program|location=Australia Government|chapter= Ch.6 Kiribati |chapterurl=http://www.pacificclimatechangescience.org/publications/reports/climate-variability-extremes-and-change-in-the-western-tropical-pacific-2014/}}&lt;/ref&gt; however in March 2015 Kiribati experienced flooding and destruction of seawalls and coastal infrastructure as the result of [[Cyclone Pam]], a Category 5 cyclone that devastated [[Vanuatu]].&lt;ref name="SBS15"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | work= SBS Australia |title= Flooding in Vanuatu, Kiribati and Tuvalu as Cyclone Pam strengthens |date =13 March 2015|url= http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2015/03/13/flooding-vanuatu-kiribati-and-tuvalu-cyclone-pam-strengthens | access-date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiribati remains exposed to the risk that cyclones can strip the low-lying islands of their vegetation and soil.

Gradual sea-level rise also allows for coral [[polyp]] activity to raise the atolls with the sea level. However, if the increase in sea level occurs at a rate faster than coral growth, or if polyp activity is damaged by [[ocean acidification]], then the resilience of the atolls and reef islands is less certain.&lt;ref name="PK14"&gt;{{cite web| last = Kench | first =Paul |title= Dynamic atolls give hope that Pacific Islands can defy sea rise (Comments) | publisher= The Conversation|chapter=|date =|url= http://theconversation.com/dynamic-atolls-give-hope-that-pacific-islands-can-defy-sea-rise-25436 | access-date=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[coral bleaching]] has led to the death of up to 80% of the coral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/08/more-than-60-of-maldives-coral-reefs-hit-by-bleaching?|title=More than 60% of Maldives' coral reefs hit by bleaching|last=Association|first=Press|date=2016-08-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kiribati Adaptation Program]] (KAP), started in 2003, is a US $5.5 million initiative that was originally enacted by the national government of Kiribati with the support of the [[Global Environment Facility]] (GEF), the [[World Bank]], the [[United Nations Development Program]], and the Japanese government. Australia later joined the coalition, donating US $1.5 million to the effort. The program aims to take place over six years, supporting measures that reduce Kiribati's vulnerability to the effects of [[climate change]] and sea level rise by raising awareness of climate change, assessing and protecting available water resources, and managing inundation. At the start of the Adaptation Program, representatives from each of the inhabited atolls identified key climatic changes that had taken place over the past 20–40 years and proposed coping mechanisms to deal with these changes under four categories of urgency of need. The program is now focusing on the country's most vulnerable sectors in the most highly populated areas. Initiatives include improving water supply management in and around Tarawa; coastal management protection measures such as mangrove re-plantation and protection of public infrastructure; strengthening laws to reduce coastal erosion; and population settlement planning to reduce personal risks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120202030155/http://www.climate.gov.ki/Kiribati_climate_change_strategies.html Government of Kiribati Climate Change Strategies]. climate.gov.ki&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:Line5304 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|A tropical islet with palm fronds oriented in the direction of the prevailing winds.]]
The climate is pleasant from April to October, with predominant northeastern winds and stable temperatures close to {{convert|30|C}}.

Because of the young geological age of the islands and atolls and high level of [[soil salination]] the flora of Kiribati is relatively poor. It contains about 83 indigenous and 306 introduced plants on Gilbert Islands, whereas the corresponding numbers for Line and Phoenix Islands are 67 and 283. None of these species are [[Endemism|endemic]], and about half of the indigenous ones have a limited distribution and became endangered or nearly extinct due to human activities such as phosphate mining.&lt;ref name=t22&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], 22&lt;/ref&gt; Coconut and pandanus palms and breadfruit trees are most common wild plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kiribati|title=Kiribati {{!}} Culture, History, &amp; People|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-07-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brit&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/319111/Kiribati Kiribati].

[[Seaweed]] farming is an important part of the economy {{why?|date=February 2017}}, with two major species ''[[Eucheuma alcarezii]]'' and ''[[Eucheuma spinosium]]'' introduced to the local lagoons from the Philippines in 1977. It competes with collection of the black-lipped pearl oyster (''[[Pinctada margaritifera]]'') and shellfish,&lt;ref name=t17&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], 17&lt;/ref&gt; which are dominated by the strombid gastropod (''[[Strombus luhuanus]]'') and Anadara cockles (''[[Anadara uropigimelana]]''), whereas the stocks of the giant clam (''[[Tridacna gigas]]'') have been largely exhausted.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiribati has a few land mammals, none being indigenous or endemic. They include the Polynesian rat (''[[Rattus exulans]]''), dogs and pigs. Among the 75 bird species, the [[Bokikokiko]] (''Acrocephalus aequinoctialis'') is endemic to [[Kiritimati]].&lt;ref name=t22/&gt;

There are 600–800 species of inshore and pelagic finfish, some 200 species of corals and about 1000 species of shellfish.&lt;ref name=t23&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], 23&lt;/ref&gt; Fishing mostly targets the family [[Scombridae]], particularly the [[skipjack tuna]] and [[yellowfin tuna]] as well as [[flying fish]] (''Cypselurus'' spp.).

[[File:Kiribati Abaiang Store.jpg|thumb|left|Goods in a shop on the outer islands.]]
[[File:Kiribati Exports Treemap (2013).png|thumb|Exports of Kiribati]]
Kiribati has few natural resources. Commercially viable [[phosphate]] deposits on [[Banaba Island|Banaba]] were exhausted at the time of independence. [[Copra]] and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. Kiribati is considered one of the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] in the world.

In one form or another, Kiribati gets a large portion of its income from abroad. Examples include fishing licenses, development assistance, worker [[remittance]]s, and tourism. Given Kiribati's limited domestic production ability, it must import nearly all of its essential foodstuffs and manufactured items; it depends on these external sources of income for financing.

The economy of Kiribati benefits from international development assistance programs. The multilateral donors providing development assistance in 2009 were the [[European Union]] (A$9 million), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (A$3.7 million), UNICEF, and the [[World Health Organization]] (A$100,000).&lt;ref name="IMF 2011 SA"/&gt; The bilateral donors providing development assistance in 2009 were Australia (A$11 million), Japan (A$2 million), [[New Zealand]] (A$6.6 million), [[Taiwan]] (A$10.6 million), and other donors providing A$16.2 million, including technical assistance grants from the [[Asian Development Bank]].&lt;ref name="IMF 2011 SA"&gt;{{cite web |title = Kiribati: Statistical Appendix |url = https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=24872.0 |publisher = International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 11/114 |date = 24 May 2011 |accessdate = 10 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |title = Kiribati: 2011 Article IV Consultation-Staff Report, Informational Annexes, Debt Sustainability Analysis, Public Information Notice on the Executive Board Discussion, and Statement by the Executive Director for Kiribati |url = https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=24871.0 |publisher = International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 11/113 |date = 24 May 2011 |accessdate = 10 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major donors in 2010/2011 were Australia (A$15 million), Taiwan (A$11 million); New Zealand (A$6 million), the [[World Bank]] (A$4 million) and the [[Asian Development Bank]].&lt;ref name=mfat&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Countries/Pacific/Kiribati.php |title = New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) |accessdate = 10 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Kiribati established a [[sovereign wealth fund]] to act as a store of wealth for the country's earnings from [[phosphate]] mining.
In 2008, the [[Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund]] was valued at US$400 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swfinstitute.org/fund/kiribati.php Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute]. Swfinstitute.org. Retrieved 2 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The RERF assets declined from A$637 million (420% of GDP) in 2007 to A$570.5 million (350% of GDP) in 2009&lt;ref name="IMF 2011 SA" /&gt; as the result of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global financial crisis]] and exposure to failed Icelandic banks. In addition, draw downs were made by the government of Kiribati to finance budgetary shortfalls during this period.&lt;ref name="IMF 2011"/&gt;

In May 2011, the IMF country report assessment of the economy of Kiribati is that “After two years of contraction, the economy recovered in the second half of 2010 and inflation pressure dissipated. It is estimated to have grown by 1.75% for the year. Despite a weather-related drop in copra production, private sector activity appears to have picked up, especially in retail. Tourist arrivals rebounded by 20% compared to 2009, although from a very low base. Despite the rise in world food and fuel prices, inflation has bounced from 2008 crisis-highs into negative territory, reflecting the strong appreciation of the Australian dollar, which is used as the domestic currency, and a decline in the world price of rice. Credit growth in the overall economy declined in 2009 as economic activity stalled. But it started to pick up in the second half of 2010 as the recovery gained traction.”&lt;ref name="IMF 2011"/&gt;

A major Australian bank, [[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group|ANZ]], maintains a presence on Kiribati&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.anz.com/kiribati/en/personal/ Personal – Online Banking | ANZ Kiribati].

===Transport===
[[File:Bonriki International Airport2.jpg|thumb|[[Bonriki International Airport]].]]
{{main|Transport in Kiribati}}

Beginning in January 2009, Kiribati has two domestic airlines: [[Air Kiribati]] and [[Coral Sun Airways]]. Both airlines are based in Tarawa's [[Bonriki International Airport]] and serve destinations across the Gilbert Islands only&lt;!-- source in [[Air Kiribati]] and [[Coral Sun Airways]]--&gt;.

Neither the Phoenix nor Line Islands are served by the domestic carriers. The only served airport by any airline is [[Cassidy International Airport]] on [[Kiritimati]]. [[Fiji]]'s national carrier [[Fiji Airways]] provides an international service from Fiji's main airport, [[Nadi International Airport]] to Cassidy Airport as well as to Bonriki Airport.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Kiribati}}
[[File:Children in Bairiki Square, Tarawa, Kiribati.JPG|thumb|[[I-Kiribati]] children in [[South Tarawa]].]]
The November 2015 census showed a population of 110,136.  About 90% of that population lived in the Gilbert Islands, with about 40% of them on South Tarawa.  If nearby Betio is included with South Tarawa, the percentage rises to more than 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Population and Housing Census, Volume 1: Management Report and Basic Tables |publisher=National Statistics Office (Ministry of Finance, Kiribati) |date=September 2016 |url=http://www.mfed.gov.ki/statistics/documents/2015_Population_Census_Report_Volume_1final_211016.pdf}}  The populations of Kiribati and of South Tarawa appear in Table 1b ("Population and No. of Households by Island, Ethnicity and Land Area: 2015") on page 32.  The population of South Tarawa is 39,058.  If the population of nearby Betio is included, the figure increases to 56,388.  The population located in the Gilbert Islands is 99,633 and is given in Table A3 ("Population Summary by Island: 1931–2015") on page 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, the people of Kiribati mostly lived in villages with populations between 50 and 3,000 on the outer islands. Most houses are made of materials obtained from coconut and pandanus trees. Frequent droughts and infertile soil hinder reliable large-scale agriculture, so the islanders have largely turned to the sea for livelihood and subsistence. Most are outrigger sailors and fishermen. Copra plantations serve as a second source of employment. In recent years large numbers of citizens have moved to the more urban island capital of Tarawa. Increasing urbanisation has raised the population of South Tarawa to 50,182.&lt;ref name="IMF 2011"/&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2017}}

=== Ethnic groups ===
The native people of Kiribati are called [[I-Kiribati]]. Ethnically, the I-Kiribati are [[Micronesia]]ns. Recent archaeological evidence indicates that [[Austronesians]] originally settled the islands thousands of years ago. Around the 14th century, Fijians, Samoans, and Tongans invaded the islands, thus diversifying the ethnic range and introducing [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] linguistic traits. Intermarriage among all ancestral groups, however, has led to a population reasonably homogeneous in appearance and traditions.

=== Languages ===
The people of Kiribati speak an [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic language]] called [[Gilbertese language|Gilbertese]]. Although English is also an [[official language]], it is not used very often outside the island capital of Tarawa. It is more likely that English is mixed in its use with Gilbertese. Older generations of I-Kiribati tend to use more complicated versions of the language. Several words in Gilbertese have been adopted from European settlers, for instance, ''kamea'' is the Gilbertese word for dog,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trussel.com/kir/glossary.htm Te taetae ni Kiribati – Kiribati Language Lessons – Glossary]. Trussel.com. Retrieved on 2016-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt; which has its origins in the I-Kiribati people hearing the European settlers saying "come here" to their dogs, and adopting that as ''kamea''.

=== Religion ===
{{Further|Religion in Kiribati}}
[[File:Kiribati(008).JPG|thumb|Christian Church in Kiribati]]
[[Christianity]] is the major religion in Kiribati, having been introduced by [[Missionary|missionaries]] in the 19th century. The population is predominantly Roman Catholic (56%), although a substantial portion of the population belongs to the [[Kiribati Uniting Church]] (34%). Many other Protestant denominations, including  [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] churches, are also represented. The [[Bahá'í Faith]] religion also exists in Kiribati (2.2%), along with Jehovah's Witnesses.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfed.gov.ki/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Census-Report-2010-Volume-1.pdf |title=2010 Kiribati census, Table 6 |publisher=Government of Kiribati |accessdate=June 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RiBPOvsM?url=http://www.mfed.gov.ki/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Census-Report-2010-Volume-1.pdf |archivedate=10 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] self-reports a membership of 19,690 (16.7%) with 30 congregations at the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics/country/kiribati|title=LDS Statistics and Church Facts - Total Church Membership|website=Mormonnewsroom.org|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kiribati Uniting Church and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints maintain large physical presences in Kiribati; both churches have a large number of church buildings, predominantly in Betio and Bonriki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/kiribatischoolfordisabled/livinginkiribati|title=Google Sites|website=Sites.google.com|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
The population of Kiribati has a life expectancy at birth of 60 years (57 for males, and 63 for females) and an infant mortality rate of 54 deaths per 1,000 live births.&lt;ref name="IMF 2011"/&gt; [[Tuberculosis]] has a small presence in the country, with 365 cases of 100,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100713063006/http://apps.who.int/globalatlas/predefinedReports/TB/PDF_Files/kir.pdf Kiribati].

Most health problems are related to consumption of semi-raw seafood, limited amount of food storage facilities, and bacterial contamination of fresh water supplies. In the early 2000s, between 1 and 7% of the population, depending on the island, were annually treated for food poisoning in a hospital. Modernization and cross-cultural exchange of the late 20th century brought new issues of unhealthy diet and lifestyle; heavy smoking, especially among the young population; and external infections, including HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=t8&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiribati is the country with the third highest prevalence of smoking, with 54% of the population reported as smokers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2014-01-08/india/45990577_1_smokeless-tobacco-smokers-tobacco-use "Number of smokers up by 35 million in 30 years, study finds"]. ''The Times of India'' (2014-01-08).&lt;/ref&gt;

Fresh water remains a concern of Kiribati – during the dry season (Aumaiaki), water has been drilled for instead of using rain water tanks. In recent years, there has been a longer than usual Aumaikai season resulting in additional water having to be drilled from beneath the water table. This has introduced water-borne illnesses, compounding the health problems within Kiribati.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climate.gov.ki/effects/fresh-water-supply/ Fresh water supply | Climate Change].

===Education===
{{Further|Education in Kiribati}}

[[File:University of South Pacific, Kiribati Campus.jpg|thumb|The [[University of South Pacific]], Kiribati Campus.]]
Primary education is free and compulsory for the first six years, now being extended to nine years. Mission schools are slowly being absorbed into the government primary school system. Higher education is expanding; students may seek technical, teacher or marine training, or study in other countries. To date, most choosing to do the latter have gone to Fiji to attend [[University of South Pacific]], and those wishing to complete medical training have been sent to Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-172788770.html Pacific Magazine: I-Kiribati Students Perform Well In Cuba], Pacific Islands Broadcasting Association, 24 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kiribati Ministry of Education]] is the education ministry. The government high schools are [[King George V and Elaine Bernacchi School]], [[Tabiteuea North Senior Secondary School]], and [[Melaengi Tabai Secondary School]]. 13 high schools are operated by Christian churches.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://vsa.org.nz/assets/Volunteer/ADSW8/41041-KIR-Eng-Language-Trainer.pdf VSA Assignment Description Assignment title English Language Trainer (of Trainers/ Teachers) Country Kiribati]."

[[University of South Pacific]] has a campus in Kiribati for distant/flexible learning, but also to provide preparatory studies towards obtaining certificates, diplomas and degrees at other campus sites.

The other prominent school in Kiribati is the Kiribati Institute of Technology.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Kiribati}}
Songs (''te anene'') and above all, dances (''te mwaie''), are held in high regard.

===Music===
{{main|Music of Kiribati}}
Kiribati folk music is generally based on [[chanting]] or other forms of vocalising, accompanied by [[body percussion]]. Public performances in modern Kiribati are generally performed by a seated chorus, accompanied by a guitar. However, during formal performances of the standing dance (''Te Kaimatoa'') or the hip dance (''Te Buki''), a wooden box is used as a percussion instrument. This box is constructed to give a hollow and reverberating tone when struck simultaneously by a chorus of men sitting around it. Traditional songs are often love-themed, but there are also competitive, religious, children's, patriotic, war and wedding songs. There are also [[tirere|stick dance]]s which accompany legends and semi-historical stories {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. These stick dances or "tirere" (pronounced seerere) are performed only during major festivals.

===Dance===
{{main|Dance in Kiribati}}
[[File:Bonriki International Airportwelcomejpg.jpg|thumb|A welcome display.]]
The uniqueness of Kiribati when compared with other forms of Pacific island dance is its emphasis on the outstretched arms of the dancer and the sudden birdlike movement of the head. The Frigate bird (''Fregata minor'') on the Kiribati flag refers to this bird-like style of Kiribati dancing. Most dances are in the standing or sitting position with movement limited and staggered. Smiling whilst dancing is generally considered vulgar within the context of Kiribati dancing. This is due to its origin of not being solely as a form of entertainment but as a form of storytelling and a display of the skill, beauty and endurance of the dancer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''In the South Seas'' and the [[Montana New Zealand Book Awards]] winner ''Akekeia!'' by Tony &amp; Joan Whincup, Wellington, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liberal internationalism''' is a [[foreign policy]] doctrine that argues that liberal states should intervene in other sovereign states in order to pursue [[Liberalism|liberal]] objectives. Such intervention can include both military [[invasion]] and [[humanitarian aid]]. This view is contrasted to [[Isolationism|isolationist]], [[Realism in international relations|realist]], or [[Non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] foreign policy doctrines; these critics characterize it as '''liberal interventionism'''. 

==History==
Liberal Internationalism emerged during the nineteenth century, notably under the auspices of British Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], and was developed in the second decade of the 20th century under U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. In this form it became known as [[Wilsonianism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Stanley Hoffmann, "The Crisis of Liberal Internationalism, ''Foreign Policy'', No. 98 (Spring, 1995), pp. 159–177.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The goal of liberal internationalism is to achieve global structures within the international system that are inclined towards promoting a liberal world order. To that extent, global free trade, liberal economics and liberal political systems are all encouraged. In addition, liberal internationalists are dedicated towards encouraging democracy to emerge globally. Once realized, it will result in a 'peace dividend', as liberal states have relations that are characterized by non-violence, and that relations between democracies is characterized by the [[democratic peace theory]].

Liberal internationalism states that, through [[multilateralism|multilateral]] organizations such as the [[United Nations]], it is possible to avoid the worst excesses of "[[power politics]]" in relations between nations.

==Examples==
Examples of liberal internationalists include former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Timothy Garton Ash |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/26/comment.labour |title=Timothy Garton Ash: After 10 years Blair knows exactly what he stands for &amp;#124; Comment is free |publisher=The Guardian |date=2010-01-08 |accessdate=2011-09-19 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, it is often associated with the American [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://prospect.org/article/debating-liberal-internationalism|title=Debating Liberal Internationalism|work=The American Prospect|access-date=2017-05-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, many [[neo-conservative]] thinkers in the United States have begun using similar arguments as liberal internationalists and, to the extent that the two ideologies have become more similar, it may show liberal internationalist thinking is spreading within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Washington Monthly Online |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0605.chotiner.html |title="The Neo-Neo-Conservative" by Isaac Chotiner |publisher=Washingtonmonthly.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329133036/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0605.chotiner.html |archivedate=2012-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that neoconservatism and liberal internationalism are distinctly different foreign policy philosophies and neoconservatives may only employ rhetoric similar to a liberal internationalist but with far different goals and methods of foreign policy intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/isec.2007.32.2.7 |title=International Security - Abstract |publisher=MIT Press Journals |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly cited examples of liberal interventionism in action include [[NATO]]'s [[NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina|intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]; their 1999 [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]]; [[British military intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War]]; and the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ash|first=Timothy Garton|title=Libya's escalating drama reopens the case for liberal intervention|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/03/libya-escalating-drama-case-liberal-intervention|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=14 June 2013|location=London|date=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ghana Local Content and Local Participation Bill 2013''' is a bill passed in November 2013 by the [[government of Ghana|Ghanaian government]] that stipulates that Ghanaians should be prioritised in terms of employment in the [[petroleum industry]], and should benefit from the country’s resources. The law is expected to ensure that Ghana’s [[natural resources]] benefit Ghanaians, while also allowing foreign [[oil]] companies to reap fair returns on their investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

| title= Local content bill now law in Ghana
| year = 2013
| publisher = SpyGhana.com
| publication-place = Ghana
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
The bill – Legislative Instrument (LI) 2204 – seeks to “promote the maximisation of [[Value added|value-addition]] and job creation through the use of local expertise, goods and services, business and financing in the petroleum industry [[value chain]] and their retention in the country; [[Capacity building|develop local capacities]] in the petroleum industry value chain through education, skills transfer and expertise development, [[transfer of technology]] and know-how and active research and development programmes; achieve the minimum local employment level and in-country spend for the provision of the goods and services in the petroleum industry value chain; increase the capability and international competitiveness of domestic businesses; and achieve and attain a degree of control for Ghanaians over development initiatives for local stakeholders”.&lt;ref name=GWeb&gt;{{Citation

| title= Local content law …engine of growth for Ghanaian enterprises
| year = 2014
| publisher = GhanaWeb.com
| publication-place = Ghana
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law also requires that a “[[General contractor|contractor]], [[sub-contractor]], [[licensee]], the corporation or other allied entity carrying out a petroleum activity shall ensure that local content is a component of the [[petroleum]] activities engaged in by that contractor, sub-contractor and licensee, the corporation or allied entity”; and that “an indigenous Ghanaian company shall be given first preference in the grant of a petroleum agreement or a licence with respect to petroleum activities subject to the fulfilment of the conditions specified in the regulations”.&lt;ref name=GWeb /&gt;

The bill also requires that “there shall be at least a five percent [[Equity (finance)|equity]] participation of an indigenous Ghanaian company other than the corporation to be qualified to enter into petroleum agreement or a petroleum licence”.&lt;ref name=GWeb /&gt;

==Reception==
The law marks one of the first steps that an [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|African]] country has taken in taking control of [[Oil reserves in Ghana|its own natural resources]] from an industry usually dominated by foreign companies. Despite this, international oil firms have broadly endorsed the bill as it fits in with many of their respective [[corporate social responsibility]] schemes. Ghana’s [[Parliament]] hailed the bill as the country’s “best hope of effectively integrating the sector into the rest of the national economy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="849">The '''Matigan-i Hazar Datistan''' was the judicial code of the ''Magistan'', the imperial parliament of the [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid Dynasty]] of the [[Parthian Empire]] (150 BCE–226 CE) and, for a while, of the [[Sassanid Empire]] (226–650 CE).

The ''Matigan-i Hazar Datistan'' was a compilation of the social, moral, civil and criminal laws of the time. Although the name suggests a thousand chapters or laws (''Hazar'': thousand), it is not known whether the code really had that many, and may simply mean 'a significant number'. 

A considerable portion of the code has been lost.

'''''Nigeria’s Top Model''''' was a television event in [[Nigeria]]. Originally the show was planned to be a multi-episode reality competition such as the original format of ''America's Next Top Model''. However, after an unsuccessful attempt to gain the rights for the 
franchise it was modeled as a competition that only lasted one evening. It took place on April 27, 2007. The event was held in [[London]] with prizes such as a contract with acclaimed agency Select Models and immediate booking for shows in [[Johannesburg]], [[Cape Town]], [[Durban]] and others. Girls between 18 and 28 and who were at least 5'8 were allowed to compete.&lt;ref&gt;http://bellanaija.blogspot.de/2007/04/nigerias-next-top-model-event.html&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;br&gt;''
In a pageant-style contest with fourteen chosen girls competing in order to win the title of ''Nigeria's Top Model''. In the first round the girls were narrowed down to six and with a second round resulting in the top 3 placements where Olabimitan Adeyinka took home victory.

==History==

===Foundation===
The creation of RT was a part of a larger [[public relations]] effort by the [[Russian Government]] in 2005 that was intended to improve the image of [[Russia]] abroad.&lt;ref name="ForeignPolicy" /&gt; RT was conceived by former media minister [[Mikhail Lesin]],&lt;ref name="Osborn"&gt;Andrew Osborn, [http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/russias-cnn-wants-to-tell-it-like-it-is/2005/08/15/1123958007022.html Russia's 'CNN' wants to tell it like it is], ''[[The Age]]'', 16 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]]'s press spokesperson Aleksei Gromov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1063693.html |title=Russia: New International Channel Ready To Begin Broadcasting |date=9 December 2005 |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of RT's founding, [[RIA Novosti]] director [[Svetlana Mironyuk]] stated: "Unfortunately, at the level of mass consciousness in the West, Russia is associated with three words: communism, snow and poverty," and added "we would like to present a more complete picture of life in our country."&lt;ref name="Osborn" /&gt; It is registered as an [[Nonprofit organization#Russia|autonomous nonprofit organization]]&lt;ref name="RT Contact info"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/about-us/contact-info/|title=Contact info|website=RT International|language=en-EN|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RN-2012"/&gt; funded by the [[federal budget of Russia]] through the [[Federal Agency on Press and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sptnkne.ws/dDaw|title=Russia Today TV to make unique contribution to global information - German expert|work=[[Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik News]]|date=6 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, RIA Novosti helped establish ANO TV-Novosti (or "[[Nonprofit organization#Russia|Autonomous Non-profit Organization]] TV-News") to serve as the parent organization for the planned channel. ANO TV-Novosti was registered on 6 April 2005.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; ANO TV-Novosti appointed Sergey Frolov as its [[chief executive officer|CEO]] position;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fapmc.ru/rospechat/newsandevents/media/2007/08/item3356.html|title=29 августа на пресс-конференции в РИА Новости генеральный директор АНО "ТВ-Новости" Сергей Фролов расскажет о планах телеканала "Русия аль-Яум" ("Россия Сегодня") на сезон 2007-2008 гг.|language=ru|trans-title=On August 29, at a press conference in RIA Novosti, Sergei Frolov, general director of the ANO TV-News, will talk about the plans of the Rusiya al-Yaum channel (Russia Today) for the 2007-2008 season.|work=[[Federal Agency on Press and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation|Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications]]|date=29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Medvedev - Russia Today 3.jpg|left|thumb|Former [[President of Russia]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] visits RT offices with Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan]]
The channel was launched as Russia Today on 10 December 2005. At its launch, the channel employed 300 journalists, including approximately 70 from outside Russia.&lt;ref name="ForeignPolicy"&gt;Julian Evans, [https://foreignpolicy.com/2005/12/01/spinning-russia/ Spinning Russia], [[Foreign Policy]], 1 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Russia Today appointed [[Margarita Simonyan]] as its [[editor-in-chief]], who recruited foreign journalists as presenters and consultants.&lt;ref name="Osborn" /&gt; Simonyan stated that the channel's intent was to have a "professional format" akin to the [[BBC]] and [[Euronews]] that would "reflect Russia's opinion of the world" and present a "more balanced picture" of Russia.&lt;ref name="RNannounce"&gt;[http://sputniknews.com/russia/20050607/40484511.html RIA Novosti launches a TV channel, Russia Today], [[RIA Novosti]], 7 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simonyan, who was only 25 years old at the time of her hiring by the channel, was a former [[Kremlin]] pool reporter and had worked in journalism since she was 18. She told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], many new young journalists were hired, resulting in a much younger pool of staffers than other news organizations.&lt;ref name="Heyman"&gt;Stephen Heyman, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/arts/television/18heym.html?_r=0 A Voice of Mother Russia, in English], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 18 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Danny Schechter]] (who has appeared as a guest on RT)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ir0Fg4JWOw Danny Schechter] interview on RT website.&lt;/ref&gt; has stated that having been part of the launch staff at [[CNN]], he saw RT as another "channel of young people who are inexperienced, but very enthusiastic about what they are doing."&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Shaun Walker, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-today-tomorrow--the-world-2083869.html Russia Today, Tomorrow the World], [[The Independent]], 20 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the channel was launched, James Painter wrote that RT and similar news channels such as [[France 24]] and [[TeleSUR]] saw themselves as "counter-hegemonic", offering a differing vision and news content from that of [[Western media]] like the [[CNN]] and the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name="Painter"&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|author=James Painter|url=http://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/documents/James_Painter.pdf |title=The boom in counter-hegemonic news channels: a case study of TeleSUR|date=2007|work=[[Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism]] at [[Oxford University]]|dead-url=y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708070119/http://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/documents/James_Painter.pdf|archive-date=8 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vladimir Putin - Visit to Russia Today television channel 2.jpg|thumb|Vladimir Putin during a visit to the new RT broadcasting centre]]
RT launched several new channels in ensuing years: the Arabic language channel [[Rusiya Al-Yaum]] in 2007, the Spanish language channel RT Actualidad in 2009, RT America – which focuses on the United States – in 2010, and the [[RT Documentary]] channel in 2011.&lt;ref name="vonTwickel"&gt;Nikolaus von Twickel, [https://rbth.com/articles/2010/03/23/230310_rt.html Russia Today courts viewers with controversy], ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', 23 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, Russia Today became the first television channel to report live from the [[North Pole]] (with the report lasting five minutes and 41 seconds). An RT crew participated in the [[Arktika 2007]] Russian polar expedition, led by [[Artur Chilingarov]] on the ''[[Akademik Fyodorov]]'' [[icebreaker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/news/russias-landmark-events-of-2007/|title=Russia's landmark events of 2007|work=RT International|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zagorodnov"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zagorodnov|first=Artem|title=Today's woman who needs to be heard|url=http://rbth.com/articles/2008/09/25/250908_rt.html|newspaper=The Moscow Times|date=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 2007, RT's broadcasts of [[New Year's Eve]] celebrations in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] were broadcast in the hours prior to the New Year's Eve event at [[New York City]]'s [[Times Square]].&lt;ref name="Zagorodnov"/&gt;

RT drew particular attention worldwide for its coverage of the [[2008 South Ossetia war]].&lt;ref name="Zagorodnov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rowland"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rowland|first=Kara|title=Russia Today: Youth served|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/oct/27/russia-today-youth-served/?page=all|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weigel"&gt;David Weigel, [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/06/pravda_will_set_you_free.single.html Pravda Will Set You Free; Russia's answer to Fox News and MSNBC.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 27 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; RT named [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] as the aggressor&lt;ref name="Weigel"/&gt; against the [[separatism|separatist]] governments of [[South Ossetia]] and [[Abkhazia]], which were protected by Russian troops.&lt;ref&gt;Charles King, [https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2009-10-11/clarity-caucasus Clarity in the Caucasus?], ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', 11 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; RT saw this as the incident that showcased its newsgathering abilities to the world.&lt;ref name=Ioffe/&gt; Margarita Simonyan stated, "we were the only ones among the English-language media who were giving the other side of the story – the South Ossetian side of the story."&lt;ref name="Rowland"/&gt;

In 2009, Russia Today rebranded itself to simply the "RT" initials.&lt;ref name="Lucas"&gt;Douglas Lucas, [http://www.salon.com/2012/02/23/julian_assange_prepares_his_next_move/ Julian Assange prepares his next move], ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', 23 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Simonyan denied that the name change was an attempt to hide its Russian origins, stating the corporate logo was changed to attract more viewers and commenting, "who is interested in watching news from Russia all day long?"&lt;ref name="vonTwickel" /&gt;

In early 2010, RT unveiled a highly controversial advertising campaign called "Question More", which was created for the channel by [[United Kingdom|Britain]]-based [[McCann Erickson]].&lt;ref name="Guardian_Harding_RT"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/18/russia-today-propaganda-ad-blitz|title=Russia Today launches first UK ad blitz|author=Luke Harding|date=18 December 2009|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the advertisements featured as part of the campaign showed [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] "morphing" into Iranian leader [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] and asked: "Who poses the greatest nuclear threat?" The ad was banned in American airports. Another showed a Western soldier "merging" into a [[Taliban]] fighter and asks: "Is terror only inflicted by terrorists?"&lt;ref name=Burrell&gt;Ian Burrell, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/from-russia-with-news-1869324.html From Russia with news], ''[[The Independent]]'', 15 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; One of RT's 2010 billboard advertisements won the British Awards for National Newspaper Advertising "Ad of the Month".&lt;ref name="Advertising"&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/entertainment-media-latest-news/rts-advertising-declared-ad-of-the-month-in-uk-154998855.html RT's Advertising Declared Ad of the Month in UK], RT.com website, 5 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vladimir Putin visited the new RT broadcasting centre in June 2013 and stated "When we designed this project back in 2005 we intended introducing another strong player on the international scene, a player that wouldn't just provide an unbiased coverage of the events in Russia but also try, let me stress, I mean – try to break the Anglo-Saxon monopoly on the global information streams. ...

Certainly the channel is funded by the government, so it cannot help but reflect the Russian government's official position on the events in our country and in the rest of the world one way or another.

In December 2012, RT moved its production studios and headquarters to a new facility in Moscow. The move coincided with RT's upgrade of all of its English-language news programming to [[high-definition television|high-definition]].&lt;ref name="Bullough" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/about-us/press-releases/rt-begins-broadcasting-in-hd-worldwide-from-new-state-of-the-art-studio/|title=RT BEGINS BROADCASTING IN HD WORLDWIDE FROM NEW, STATE OF THE ART STUDIO|work=RT International|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/about-us/history/|title=History|website=RT International|language=en-EN|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin America is the second most significant area of influence for internet RT (rt.com). In 2013, RT ascended to the ranks of the 100 most watched websites in seven Latin American countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cervantes.es/imagenes/el_espa%C3%B1ol_federaci%C3%B3n_rusa.pdf] Sagarra Ángel, Josep María de; Soler Herreros, Chimo "El español en la Federación de Rusia: factor determinante en las relaciones con los países hispanohablantes".

A [[Pew Research]] survey of the most popular news videos on [[YouTube]] in 2011-12, found RT to be the top source with 8.5 percent of posts. However of these, 68 percent consisted of first-person video accounts of dramatic worldwide events, likely acquired by the network rather than created by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=YouTube Video Creation–A Shared Process |url=http://www.journalism.org/2012/07/16/youtube-video-creationa-shared-process/ |website=journalism.org |publisher=Pew Research Center |date=16 July 2012 |accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Martinez, [http://thehill.com/policy/technology/238157-pew-rt-fox-news-are-top-sources-of-popular-news-videos Pew: Russia Today], [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]], 16 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, RT became the first television news channel to reach 1 billion views on YouTube.&lt;ref name="SpiegelBidder"/&gt; In 2014 its main (English) channel was reported have 1.4 million subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Sullivan |first=John |author-link=John O'Sullivan (columnist) |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9390782/the-truth-about-russia-today-is-that-it-is-putins-mouthpiece/ |title=The difference between real journalism and Russia Today |publisher=[[The Spectator]] |date=6 December 2014 |accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' reported that RT hugely exaggerated its global viewership and that its most-watched segments were on apolitical subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Putin's Propaganda TV Lies About Its Popularity|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/17/putin-s-propaganda-tv-lies-about-ratings.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2013 and 2015, more than 80% of RT's viewership was for videos of accidents, crime, disasters, and natural phenomena, such as the 2013 [[Chelyabinsk meteor|Chelyabinsk meteor event]], with less than 1% of viewership for political videos.&lt;ref name=Zavaski17Sept/&gt; In late 2015, all of the 20 most watched videos on its main channel, totaling 300 million views were described as "disaster/novelty".

A study involving Professor Robert Orttung at [[George Washington University]] states that RT uses human interest stories without ideological content to attract viewers to its channels. Also between January and May 2015, the Russian-language channel actually had the most viewers, with approximately double the number of the main channel, despite only having around one third the number of subscribers.&lt;ref name=Orttung&gt;{{citation |last1=Nelson |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Orttung |first2=Robert |last3=Livshen |first3=Anthony |title=Measuring RT's Impact on YouTube |url=http://www.css.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/cis/center-for-securities-studies/pdfs/RussianAnalyticalDigest177.pdf |publisher=Forschungsstelle Osteuropa Bremen, Germany, Center for Security Studies (CSS), ETH Zurich, Switzerland, Institute of History, University of Basel |journal=Russian Analytical Digest |number=177 |date=8 December 2015 |accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Heidi Brown wrote in ''[[Forbes]]'' that "the Kremlin is using charm, good photography and a healthy dose of sex appeal to appeal to a diverse, skeptical audience.

=== ''The Alyona Show'' ===

''[[The Alyona Show]]'', hosted by [[Alyona Minkovski]], ran from 2009 to 2012 (when Minkovski left RT to join ''[[The Huffington Post]]''). ''[[The Daily Beast|Daily Beast]]'' writer [[Tracy Quan]] described ''The Alyona Show'' as "one of RT's most popular vehicles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tracy Quan |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/03/i-love-the-julian-assange-show.html |title=I Love the Julian Assange Show! |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=3 July 2012 |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Republic]]'' columnist Jesse Zwick wrote that one journalist told him that Minkovski is "probably the best interviewer on cable news."&lt;ref name="Zwick" /&gt; Benjamin R.

And the fact that my channel is more honest with the American people is something you should be ashamed of.", ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' writer [[Julia Ioffe]] asked "since when does Russia Today defend the policies of any American president? Or the informational needs of the American public, for that matter?"&lt;ref name="Ioffe"/&gt;

=== ''Adam vs. the Man'' ===

From April to August 2011, RT ran a half-hour primetime show ''Adam vs. the Man'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110418204433/http://www.adamvstheman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/AVTM-Press-Release-110403.pdf RT America Launches New Show, Hosted by Former US Marine, Adam Kokesh], press release on [http://www.adamvstheman.com/ Adam vs The Man] web site, 4 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamvstheman.com/blog/episodes/final-episode-east-coast-quake-libya-rebellion-you-the-viewer-teachers-social-media-net-neutrality-media-blackout-on-ron-paul/|title=FINAL EPISODE: East Coast Quake, Libya Rebellion, You The Viewer, Teachers &amp; Social Media, Net Neutrality, Media Blackout on Ron Paul?|date=25 August 2011|publisher=RT|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924074939/http://www.adamvstheman.com/blog/episodes/final-episode-east-coast-quake-libya-rebellion-you-the-viewer-teachers-social-media-net-neutrality-media-blackout-on-ron-paul|archivedate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Politico"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ron Paul booster's show cancelled after FEC complaint|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/onmedia/0811/Ron_Paul_boosters_show_cancelled_after_FEC_complaint.html|newspaper=Politico|date=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted by former [[Iraq War]] Marine veteran and high-profile anti-war activist [[Adam Kokesh]]. David Weigel writes that Kokesh defended RT's "propaganda" function, saying "We're putting out the truth that no one else wants to say. I mean, if you want to put it in the worst possible abstract, it's the Russian government, which is a competing protection racket against the other governments of the world, going against the United States and calling them on their bullshit."&lt;ref name="Weigel" /&gt; The conservative media watchdog [[Accuracy in Media]] criticized Kokesh's appearance on RT, writing RT uses Americans like Kokesh to make propaganda points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.org/aim-column/kgb-tv-to-air-show-hosted-by-anti-war-marine-vet/|title=KGB TV to Air Show Hosted by Anti-war Marine Vet|date=5 April 2011|publisher=Accuracy in Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''World Tomorrow'' ===

Reviewing Julian Assange's show ''World Tomorrow'', ''[[The Independent]]'' noted that Assange, who was under [[house arrest]], was "largely deferential" in asking some questions of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who himself was in hiding. However, he also asked tough questions such as why Nasrallah had not supported Arab revolts against Syrian leaders, when he had supported them in Tunisia, Yemen, Egypt, and other countries.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; ''The New York Times'' journalist Allesandra Stanley wrote that "practically speaking, Mr. Assange is in bed with the Kremlin, but on Tuesday's show he didn't put out" and that he "behaved surprisingly like a standard network interviewer."&lt;ref name="Stanley" /&gt; Douglas Lucas in [[Salon (website)|Salon]] wrote that the RT deal "may just be a profitable way for him to get a gigantic retweet."&lt;ref name="Lucas" /&gt; Glenn Greenwald, who has been a guest on RT,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD1oWvfRcAU Glenn Greenwald ] interview on RT website.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that RT presenting the Julian Assange show led to "a predictable wave of snide, smug attacks from American media figures".&lt;ref name="Greenwald"&gt;[[Glenn Greenwald]], [http://www.salon.com/2012/04/18/attacks_on_rt_and_assange_reveal_much_about_the_critics/ Attacks on RT and Assange reveal much about the critics], ''Salon'', 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Adomanis rebuts some of the "fevered denunciations" against RT and Julian Assange in an article in ''[[Forbes]]''.&lt;ref name="Adomanis" /&gt; A ''[[Moscow Times]]'' writer noted that RT has received "considerable" criticism in general.&lt;ref name="Zagorodnov" /&gt;

The English language RT International, RT America and RT UK channels carry similar programming, with the latter channels focusing more on news from the United States and the United Kingdom. RT Arabic and Actualidad RT in Spanish feature their own news presenters, as well as translated versions of RT's English programming.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Marcin Maczka writes that RT's ample financing has allowed RT to attract experienced journalists and use the latest technology.&lt;ref name="Maczka" /&gt; RT anchors and correspondents tend to concentrate on controversial world issues such as the financial and banking scandals, corporate impact on the global economy, and western demonstrations. It has also aired views by various conspiracy theorists, including neo-Nazis, White Supremacists, and Holocaust deniers (presented as "human rights activists").&lt;ref name="Scherr"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sonia Scherr|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2010/russian-tv-channel-pushes-patriot-conspiracy-theories|title=Russian TV Channel Pushes 'Patriot' Conspiracy Theories|work=Intelligence Report, Southern Poverty Law Center|date=1 August 2010|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; News from Russia is of secondary importance and such reports emphasize Russian modernisation and economic achievements, as well as Russian culture and natural landscapes, while downplaying Russia's social problems or corruption.&lt;ref name="Heyman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maczka" /&gt;

==Guests==
[[File:Vladimir Putin interview to RT 6 September 2012.ogv|thumb|Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] RT interview, 6 September 2012]]
According to Jesse Zwick, RT persuades "legitimate experts and journalists" to appear as guests by allowing them to speak at length on issues ignored by larger news outlets. It frequently interviews [[progressivism|progressive]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] academics, intellectuals and writers from organisations like ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason magazine]]'', [[Human Events]], [[Center for American Progress]]&lt;ref name="Zwick" /&gt; and the [[Cato Institute]]&lt;ref name="Weigel"/&gt; who are critical of [[United States]] foreign and civil liberties policies.&lt;ref name="Zwick" /&gt; RT also features little known commentators, including anarchists, anti-globalists and left-wing activists.&lt;ref name="Maczka" /&gt; Journalist [[Danny Schechter]] holds that a primary reason for RT's success in the United States is that RT is "a force for diversity" which gives voice to people "who rarely get heard in current mainstream US media."&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt;

Notable guests have included think tank intellectuals like [[Jared Bernstein]],&lt;ref name="Weigel" /&gt; [[John Feffer]] and [[Lawrence Korb]]; journalists and writers [[Jacob Sullum]], [[Pepe Escobar]],&lt;ref name="Zwick" /&gt; and [[Brian Doherty (journalist)|Brian Doherty]],&lt;ref name="Quan" /&gt; and heads of state, including Ecuador's [[Rafael Correa]],&lt;ref name="Quan"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tracy Quan |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/03/i-love-the-julian-assange-show.html |title=I Love the Julian Assange Show! |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=3 July 2012 |accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Syria's [[Bashar al-Assad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/11/syrias-assad-does-not-see-civil-war-blames-the-west.html Syria's Assad denies civil war, blames the West], [[Los Angeles Times]], 9 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nigel Farage]], the leader of [[UK Independence Party]] from 2010 to 2016, appeared on RT eighteen times from 2010 to 2014.&lt;ref name=BuzzFeedPSmith/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/31/farage-i-admire-putin|title=Nigel Farage: I admire Vladimir Putin|publisher=The Guardian|date=31 March 2014|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 journalist and blogger [[Julia Ioffe]] described RT as being "provocative just for the sake of being provocative" in its choice of guests and issue topics, featuring a Russian historian who predicted that the United States would soon be dissolved, showing speeches by [[Venezuela]]n President [[Hugo Chávez]], reporting on [[homelessness]] in America, and interviewing the chairman of the [[New Black Panther Party]]. She wrote that in attempting to offer "an alternate point of view, it is forced to talk to marginal, offensive, and often irrelevant figures".&lt;ref name="Ioffe"/&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine noted that RT's programming, while sometimes interesting and unobjectionable, and sometimes "hard-edged", also presents "wild conspiracy theories" that can be regarded as "kooky".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2010/07/russia_today_goes_mad Airwaves wobbly], [[The Economist]], 6 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] report stated that RT extensively covered the "[[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|birther]]" and the "[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]" conspiracy theories and interviewed militia organizer [[Jim Stachowiak]] and [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] [[Jared Taylor]].&lt;ref name="Scherr"/&gt; An [[Al Jazeera English]] article stated that RT has a penchant "for off-beat stories and conspiracy theories."&lt;ref name="Sousa"/&gt; The news channel has also been criticized for its lack of objectivity in its coverage of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia Today Continues its Anti-Israel Propaganda, Going Even Further Than Arab TV|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/11/22/russia-today-continues-its-anti-israel-propaganda-going-even-further-than-arab-tv/#|website=the algemeiner|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miko Peled]], the Israeli peace activist who has called the peace process "a process of apartheid &amp; colonization" is a frequent guest on RT.

[[Margarita Simonyan]] told [[Nikolaus von Twickel]] of ''[[The Moscow Times]]'' that RT started to grow once it became provocative and that controversy was vital to the channel. She said that RT's task was not to polish Moscow's reputation.&lt;ref name="vonTwickel"/&gt;.

[[Manuel Ochsenreiter]], a [[neo-Nazi]], has repeatedly appeared on RT to represent the German point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/rts-regular-air-german-host-manuel-ochsenreiter-exposed-neo-nazi-editor-1441605|title=RT Host Manuel Ochsenreiter Exposed as Neo-Nazi Editor|last=Mezzofiore|first=Gianluca|date=24 March 2014|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; RT News has also frequently hosted [[Richard B.

[[Steve Bannon]] has stated that he has appeared on RT "probably 100 times or more".&lt;ref name="Stone_Gordon_3/20/2017"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Peter|last2=Gordon|first2=Greg|title=FBI's Russian-influence probe includes a look at Breitbart, InfoWars news sites|website=[[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy DC Bureau]]|date=March 20, 2017|url=https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article139695453.html|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propaganda claims and related issues===
Critics regard RT as a [[propaganda]] outlet for the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]] and [[Foreign relations of Russia|its foreign policy]].&lt;ref name=Ioffe/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knobel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SpiegelBidder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian_Harding_RT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kramer"/&gt;

==== Watchdogs and NGOs ====
Pascal Bonnamour, the head of the European department of [[Reporters Without Borders]], called the newly announced network "another step of the state to control information."&lt;ref name="kommersant.com"&gt;[http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?idr=530&amp;id=619775 Reporters Without Borders Don't Fancy Russia Today] ''[[Kommersant]]'' 21 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliff Kincaid, the director of [[Accuracy in Media]]'s Center for Investigative Journalism, called RT "the well-known disinformation outlet for Russian propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aim.org/aim-column/why-wont-putin-help-middle-east-christians/|title=Why Won’t Putin Help Middle East Christians?|last=Kincaid|first=Cliff|date=22 August 2014|work=[[Accuracy in Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of 2015, graduate students at [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|Columbia School of Journalism]] took part in the RT Watch project, monitoring RT's (US) output. Casey Michel, who worked on the project, wrote "RT ignores the inherent traits of journalism—checking sources, relaying facts, attempting honest reportage" and "you’ll find 'experts' lacking in expertise, conspiracy theories without backing, and, from time to time, outright fabrication for the sake of pushing a pro-Kremlin line".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/putin-rt-soviet-propaganda-121734|title=Putin's Magnificent Messaging Machine|last=Michel|first=Casey|date=25 August 2015|work=Politico|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/rt-propaganda-columbia-journalism-students-blog-coverage/26869048.html|title='Propaganda Bullhorn' Or 'Alternative Perspective'?

==== Commentators ====
In a 2005 interview with U.S. government-owned external broadcaster Voice of America, the Russian-Israeli blogger [[Anton Nosik]] said the creation of RT "smacks of [[Soviet propaganda|Soviet-style propaganda]] campaigns."&lt;ref name="VOANew"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-2005-07-06-voa33-66930727/377326.html|title=New Global TV Venture to Promote Russia|date=6 July 2005|newspaper=VOANews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Luke Harding]] (then Moscow correspondent for ''[[The Guardian]]'') described RT's advertising campaign in the United Kingdom as an "ambitious attempt to create a new post-Soviet global propaganda empire."&lt;ref name="Guardian_Harding_RT" /&gt;

Former [[KGB]] officer turned [[political refugee]], [[Konstantin Preobrazhensky]], criticized RT as "a part of the Russian industry of misinformation and manipulation".&lt;ref name="Preobraz" /&gt; RT presents itself as a liberal alternative in the United States, but in Europe it appears to have become the flagship of resurgent nationalist parties.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seattleglobalist.com/2015/05/06/russia-today-rt-putin-holocaust-ultra-right/35844|title=Have you been watching Russian government propaganda?|last=Hilsman|first=Patrick|website=The Seattle Globalist|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, [[Andrey Illarionov]], former advisor to Vladimir Putin, has called the channel "the best Russian propaganda machine targeted at the outside world".&lt;ref name="Heyman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maczka" /&gt; Media analyst Vasily Gatov wrote in a 2014 ''[[The Moscow Times|Moscow Times]]'' article that sharp ethical and reporting skills are not required for Russian media employees, including RT.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/russian-journalism-is-crippled-by-its-cynicism/502735.html|title=Russian Journalism is Crippled by Its Cynicism|last=Gatov|first=Vasily|date=1 July 2014|work=The Moscow Times|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== States ====
{{flag|Lithuania}} – [[Linas Antanas Linkevičius]], Lithuania's Minister of Foreign Affairs, posted on Twitter on 9 March 2014 amid the [[2014 Crimean crisis|Crimean crisis]], "Russia Today propaganda machine is no less destructive than military marching in Crimea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/LinkeviciusL/status/442607548303425536|title=Linas Linkevicius on Twitter|work=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flag|United States}} – The [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]] compelled RT to file paperwork under the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] in the United States in September 2017.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/350226-russian-network-rt-must-register-as-foreign-agent-in|title=Russian network RT must register as foreign agent in US|last=Balluck|first=Kyle|date=2017-09-12|work=TheHill|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the [[United States Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]] had referred to RT as a state-sponsored "propaganda bullhorn" and he continued by saying, "{{sic|Russia Today}} network has deployed to promote president Putin's fantasy about what is playing out on the ground. They almost spend full-time devoted to this effort, to propagandize, and to distort what is happening or not happening in Ukraine."&lt;ref name="JKerry"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Secretary Kerry on Ukraine|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?319014-1/secretary-kerry-ukraine|publisher=CSPAN|date=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; RT responded that they wanted "an official response from the U.S. Department of State substantiating Mr. Kerry's claims."&lt;ref name="BI RTupset"&gt;{{citation|title=RT Is Very Upset With John Kerry For Blasting Them As Putin's 'Propaganda Bullhorn'|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/john-kerry-rt-propaganda-bullhorn-russia-today-2014-4|publisher=Business Insider|date=26 April 2014|author=Logiurato, Brett}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Stengel]] from the U.S. [[Department of State]] responded.&lt;ref name="BI State Department"&gt;{{citation|title=Russia's Propaganda Channel Just Got A Journalism Lesson From The US State Department|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/state-department-responds-rt-russia-today-john-kerry-2014-4#!HDahV|publisher=Business Insider|date=29 April 2014|author=Logiurato}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stengel stated in his response, "RT is a distortion machine, not a news organization," concluding that "the network and its editors should not pretend that RT is anything other than another player in Russia's global disinformation campaign against the people of Ukraine and their supporters". However, Stengel supports RT's right to broadcast in the United States.&lt;ref name="Stengel"&gt;{{citation|title=Russia Today's Disinformation Campaign|url=http://2007-2017-blogs.state.gov/stories/2014/04/29/russia-today-s-disinformation-campaign2679.html?page=1|publisher=U.S. Department of State|date=29 April 2014|author=Stengel, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Political involvement ====
In April 2017, during his successful run for President of France, [[Emmanuel Macron]]'s [[French presidential election, 2017|campaign team]] banned both RT and the [[Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik news agency]] from campaign events. A Macron spokesperson said the two outlets showed a "systematic desire to issue fake news and false information".&lt;ref name="Emmanuel Macron’s campaign team bans Russian news outlets from events"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/27/russia-emmanuel-macron-banned-news-outlets-discrimination|title=Emmanuel Macron’s campaign team bans Russian news outlets from events|date=27 April 2017|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 May 2017|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macron later said during a press conference that RT and Sputnik were "agencies of influence and propaganda, lying propaganda—no more, no less".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/welcome-to-the-machine-inside-the-secretive-world-of-rt-58132|title=Welcome to The Machine: Inside the Secretive World of RT|access-date=2017-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, [[Twitter]] banned both RT and Sputnik from advertising on their social networking service amid accusations of [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], sparking an angry response from the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian foreign ministry]].&lt;ref name="Twitter bans RT and Sputnik ads amid election interference fears"&gt;{{cite|title = Twitter bans RT and Sputnik ads amid election interference fears|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41766991|publisher = BBC News|date = 26 October 2017|accessdate = 4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet]] chairman [[Eric Schmidt]] announced that [[Google]] will be "deranking" stories from RT and Sputnik in response to allegations about election meddling by President Putin's government, provoking an accusation of [[censorship]] from both outlets.&lt;ref name="Google to 'derank' Russia Today and Sputnik"&gt;{{cite|title = Google to 'derank' Russia Today and Sputnik|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42065644|publisher = BBC News|date = 21 November 2017|accessdate = 22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, [[John McDonnell]], the [[Shadow Chancellor]] of the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], advised fellow Labour MPs to boycott RT and said he would no longer appear on the channel. He said: "We tried to be fair with them and as long as they abide by journalistic standards that are objective that's fine but it looks as if they have gone beyond that line". However, a party representative said: "We are keeping the issue under review".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=John McDonnell urges Labour MPs to stop appearing on Russia Today|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43363165|publisher = BBC News|date = 11 March 2018|accessdate = 11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment of Putin and Medvedev====

A 2007 article in the Christian Science Monitor wrote that RT reported on the good job Putin was doing in the world and next to nothing on things like the conflict in Chechnya or the murder of government critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0308/p07s02-woeu.html|title=Russian bid to counter Western criticism|author=The Christian Science Monitor|work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2010 report by ''The Independent'', RT journalists have said that coverage of sensitive issues in Russia is allowed, but direct criticism of Vladimir Putin or President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] was not.&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt; Masha Karp wrote in ''[[Standpoint (magazine)|Standpoint]]'' magazine that contemporary Russian issues "such as the suppression of free speech and peaceful demonstrations, or the economic inefficiency and corrupt judiciary, are either ignored or their significance played down".&lt;ref&gt;Masha Karp [http://standpointmag.co.uk/node/2709 "Counterpoints: KGB TV"], ''Standpoint'', March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Stephen Heyman wrote in ''The New York Times'' that in RT's Russia, "corruption is not quite a scourge but a symptom of a developing economy."&lt;ref name="Heyman" /&gt; Speaking after the launch of RT America, [[Garry Kasparov]] said "Russia Today is an extension of the methods and approach of the state-controlled media inside Russia, applied in a bid to influence the American cable audience".&lt;ref name="Kramer"/&gt;

====Anti-Americanism and anti-Westernism====
''[[The New Republic]]'' writer [[James Kirchick]] accused the network of "often virulent [[anti-Americanism]], worshipful portrayal of Russian leaders."&lt;ref name="Kirchick"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirchick|first=James|title=Pravda on the Potomac (page 2)|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/pravda-the-potomac|newspaper=The New Republic|date=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Lucas (journalist)|Edward Lucas]] wrote in ''[[The Economist]]'' (quoted in [[Al Jazeera English]]) that the core of RT was "anti-Westernism."&lt;ref name="Sousa"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sousa|first=Ann De|title=News channel or propaganda tool?|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2011/03/201132714649315858.html|newspaper=Al-Jazeera|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julia Ioffe wrote "Often, it seemed that Russia Today was just a way to stick it to the U.S. from behind the façade of legitimate newsgathering."&lt;ref name="Ioffe"/&gt; Shaun Walker wrote in ''[[The Independent]]'' that RT "has made a name for itself as a strident critic of US policy."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Shaun|title=Assange takes chat-show job with state-funded Russian TV|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/assange-takes-chatshow-job-with-statefunded-russian-tv-6294553.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allesandra Stanley wrote in ''The New York Times'' that RT is "like the Voice of America, only with more money and a zesty anti-American slant."&lt;ref name="Stanley"/&gt; [[David Weigel]] writes that RT goes further than merely creating distrust of the United States government, to saying, in effect: "You can trust the Russians more than you can trust those bastards."&lt;ref name="Weigel"/&gt;

Russian studies professor [[Stephen F. Cohen]] stated in 2012 that RT does a lot of stories that "reflect badly" on the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and much of Western Europe and that they are "particularly aggrieved by American sermonizing abroad." Citing that RT compares stories about Russia allowing mass protests of the [[2011–2012 Russian protests|2011–2012 Russian election protests]] with those of U.S. authorities nationwide arresting members of the [[Occupy movement]]. Cohen states that despite the pro-Kremlin slant, "any intelligent viewer can sort this out. I doubt that many idiots find their way to RT."&lt;ref name="Zwick"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zwick|first=Jesse|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/world/magazine/101703/russia-tv-rtv-cohen-alyona|title=Pravda Lite|work=[[The New Republic]]|date=14 March 2012|accessdate=14 February 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt; RT also have proliferated stories such as the [[police brutality]] in the US, the crack cocaine usage of Toronto mayor [[Rob Ford]], and the poverty among people of Arab descent in Western Europe.

According to Lithuania's STRATCOM Colonel, "RT rarely takes a single, anti-Western media line on any given story. That would be too obvious. Instead, RT journalists present gaggles of competing and contradicting narratives which together create the impression that the truth is indecipherable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Colonel in Charge of Countering Russian Propaganda in Lithuania|url=https://news.vice.com/article/meet-the-colonel-in-charge-of-countering-russian-propaganda-in-lithuania|website=Vice News|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Feffer]], co-director of [[Foreign Policy in Focus]] says he appears on RT as well as the U.S.-funded Voice of America and [[Radio Free Asia]], commented "I’ve been given the opportunity to talk about military expenditures in a way I haven’t been given in U.S. outlets". On the fairness issue, he said: "You're going to find blind spots in the coverage for any news organization".&lt;ref name="Zwick"/&gt;

====Airing conspiracy theories====
A 2013 article in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' noted that RT "uses a chaotic mixture of conspiracy theories and crude propaganda", pointing to a program that "mutated" the [[Boston Marathon bombings]] into a U.S. government conspiracy.&lt;ref name="SpiegelBidder"&gt;{{cite news|author=Benjamin Bidder|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/putin-fights-war-of-images-and-propaganda-with-russia-today-channel-a-916162.html|title=Putin's Weapon in the War of Images|work=Spiegel Online|date=13 August 2013|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of RT UK was the subject of much comment in the British press. In ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Nick Cohen]] accused the channel of spreading conspiracy theories and being a "prostitution of journalism" and in ''[[The Times]]'', [[Oliver Kamm]] called on broadcast regulator [[Ofcom]] to act against this "den of deceivers".&lt;ref name=BBCMonitoring&gt;{{cite news|last=Ennis|first=Stephen|title=Russia's global media operation under the spotlight|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30040363|work=[[BBC News]]|date=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Peter Pomerantsev]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' accused RT of disinformation and of spreading conspiracy theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/apr/09/kremlin-hall-of-mirrors-military-information-psychology|title=Inside the Kremlin's hall of mirrors|last=Pomerantsev|first=Peter|date=9 April 2015|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008–2012====
During the [[2008 South Ossetia War]], RT correspondent William Dunbar resigned after the network refused to let him report on Russian airstrikes of civilian targets, stating, "any issue where there is a Kremlin line, RT is sure to toe it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/william-dunbar-they-forced-me-out-for-telling-the-truth-about-georgia-2083870.html|title=They forced me out for telling the truth about Georgia|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=20 September 2010|author=William Dunbar}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', sources at RT confirmed that Dunbar had resigned, but rejected that it was over bias. One senior RT journalist told the magazine, "the Russian coverage I have seen has been much better than much of the Western coverage... When you look at the Western media, there is a lot of genuflection towards the powers that be. Russian news coverage is largely pro-Russia, but that is to be expected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2008/scene/markets-festivals/russia-claims-media-bias-1117990468/|title=Russia claims media bias; Foreign minister blasts coverage of conflict|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=12 August 2008|author=Nick Holdsworth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaun Walker, the Moscow correspondent for ''[[The Independent]]'', said that RT had "instructed reporters not to report from Georgian villages within [[South Ossetia]] that had been [[ethnic cleansing|ethnically cleansed]]."&lt;ref name=Burrell/&gt; Julia Ioffe wrote that an RT journalist whose reporting deviated from "the Kremlin line that Georgians were slaughtering unarmed Ossetians" was reprimanded.&lt;ref name="Ioffe"/&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] said that RT's claim of 2,000 South Ossetian casualties was exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/Top_News/2008-08-10/Death_toll_in_South_Ossetia_reaches_2000.html|title=Death toll in South Ossetia reaches 2,000|newspaper=Russia Today|date=10 August 2008|deadurl=y|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202163115/http://rt.com/Top_News/2008-08-10/Death_toll_in_South_Ossetia_reaches_2000.html|archivedate=2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/13/georgia|title=Russia exaggerating South Ossetian death toll, says human rights group|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 August 2008|author=Tom Parfitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RT covering protests in Moscow on 1012.JPG|left|thumb|RT team covering protests in [[Bolotnaya Square]] in Moscow on 10 December 2011]]
In 2012, Jesse Zwick of ''[[The New Republic]]'' criticized RT, stating it held that "civilian casualties in Syria are minimal, foreign intervention would be disastrous, and any humanitarian appeals from Western nations are a thin veil for a NATO-backed move to isolate Iran, China, and Russia." He wrote that RT wants to "make the United States look out of line for lecturing Russia."&lt;ref name="Zwick" /&gt; Zwick also wrote that RT provided a "disproportionate amount of time" to covering [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Ron Paul]] during [[Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2012|his 2012 presidential campaign]]. Writing after her 2014 on-air resignation, [[Liz Wahl]] suggested the reason for this "wasn't his message of freedom and liberty but his non-interventionist stance and consistent criticism of U.S. foreign policy. His message fit RT's narrative that the United States is a huge bully."&lt;ref name=Wahl/&gt; In a June 2011 broadcast of ''Adam vs. the Man'', host [[Adam Kokesh]] had endorsed fundraising for Paul, leading to a complaint to the [[Federal Election Commission]] charging a political contribution had been made by a foreign corporation.

In September 2012, [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] broadcast regulator [[Ofcom]] found that two [[Libya]]n dispatches broadcast by RT's [[Lizzie Phelan]] in a year earlier were in breach of its code on accuracy and impartiality. The following November, RT was again found in breach of impartiality rules in relation to its coverage of the Syrian conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb217/obb217.pdf Ofcom Broadcast Bulletin - Syrian news coverage], 5 November 2012, pp 15-27.&lt;/ref&gt; An August 2013 story concerning unverified reports of the killing of 450 [[Kurds|Kurdish]] civilians near the Turkey-Syria border was also found to have breached Ofcom's rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb2402/obb241.pdf Ofcom Broadcast Bulletin - Graphic footage], 4 November 2013, pp 14-17.&lt;/ref&gt; That December, Ofcom found RT in breach of its standards in relation to the impartiality of a documentary entitled "Syrian Diary" broadcast the previous March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/2431/obb244.pdf Ofcom Broadcast Bulletin - Syrian Diary], 16 December 2013, pp 6-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in 2014 former RT reporter Sara Firth said that there had previously been examples of senior editorial interference, and that she had been pulled out of Syria after some "very heated discussions" about the channel's coverage.&lt;ref name=sarafirth/&gt;

On 4 March 2014, ''Breaking The Set'' host [[Abby Martin (journalist)|Abby Martin]], speaking directly to her viewing audience during the show's closing statement, said that even though she works for RT, she is against Russia's intervention in Ukraine.

On 5 March 2014, RT Washington, D.C. bureau anchor Liz Wahl resigned on air, blaming RT for propaganda. Wahl stated that what "broke" her was that RT censored a question from her interview with Ron Paul about "Russia's ''intervention'' in Ukraine". In response, RT released a statement: "When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional. But when someone makes a big public show of a personal decision, it is nothing more than a self-promotional stunt. We wish Liz the best of luck on her chosen path".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/usa/rt-reacts-liz-wahl-042/|title=RT reacts to anchor Liz Wahl quitting on air|work=RT International|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a March 2014 ''Politico'' article, Wahl stated "For about two and a half years.

[[File:Liz Wahl on RT America.png|thumb|200px|RT America broadcast with former anchor [[Liz Wahl]]]]
When asked about a clip of her interviewing a guest on RT by [[Brian Stelter]], host of CNN's ''[[Reliable Sources]]'', Wahl responded,
{{cquote|They get these extreme voices on that have this kind of hostile toward the West viewpoints towards the world, very extremist. These are the people that they have on. And when I was on the anchor desk, they would instruct you to egg on these guests and try to get them, you know, rallied up, to really fire off their anti-American talking points. Listen, I'm all about exposing government corruption. I'm all about being critical of the government. But this is different. This is promoting the foreign policy of somebody that has just invaded a country, has invaded the country and is then lying about it, is using the media as a tool to fulfill his foreign policy interests. And RT is part of Putin's propaganda network and it's very, very troubling in the wake of what is going on in Ukraine today.&lt;ref name="Reliable Sources"&gt;{{cite news|title=Putin TV in Chaos|url=http://edition.cnn.com/videos/bestoftv/2014/03/23/rs-putin-tv-in-chaos.cnn|&lt;!--http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1403/23/rs.01.html--&gt;|publisher=CNN|date=24 March 2014|author=Brian Stelter}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The New York Times'' [[op-ed]] columnist [[Nicholas Kristof]] commented on CNN's ''[[Piers Morgan Live]]'' about Wahl's and Martin's initial actions, "admire their outspokenness but, you know, at the end of the day, RT is a Russian propaganda arm, and I don't think its going to matter very much to the geopolitical consequences here."&lt;ref name="Piers"&gt;{{cite video|title=New Cold War?|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1403/05/pmt.01.html|publisher=CNN|author=Piers Morgan|date=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former RT Moscow anchor Stacy Bivens, and other former RT journalists speaking under anonymity according to [[BuzzFeed]], said they regretted working for the network, citing their dislike of the network's use of propaganda. Bivens, for example, was explicitly asked to go to Germany and procure a story proving that "Germany is a [[failed state]]". When she rejected, other reporters were sent instead.&lt;ref name="Bivens"&gt;{{cite news|title=How the Truth is Made at Russia Today|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/how-the-truth-is-made-at-russia-today|date=13 March 2014|publisher=BuzzFeed|author=Gray, Rosie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Bloomfield, the foreign editor of ''[[Monocle (lifestyle magazine)|Monocle]]'' wrote that RT's "coverage of Ukraine could not have been kinder to Moscow if Vladimir Putin had chosen the running order himself. While Putin kept up the pretence that there were no Russian troops in Crimea, so too did RT. The storming of government buildings across eastern Ukraine has been portrayed as the understandable actions of peace-loving protesters who fear "chaos" in Kiev".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ofcom should be looking again at Putin's TV news channel|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/24/ukraine-russia-putin-news-reporting|date=24 April 2014|publisher=The Guardian|author=Bloomfield, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sara Firth, a London-based correspondent with RT resigned in protest over the network's coverage of the MH17 disaster. Shortly before resigning, she [[tweeted]], "RT style guide Rule 1: It is ALWAYS * Ukraine's fault (* add name as applicable)". She told the Guardian "I walked into the newsroom and there was an eyewitness account making allegations [against Ukraine] and analysis, if you can call it, from our correspondent in the studio. It was just appalling, in a situation like that where there are families waiting to be informed and a devastating loss of life." She also noted that "There is bias against Russia but you don’t counter wrong by doing even more wrong" and stated "I have always said it's better to have RT than to not have that perspective, but actually with a story like this and the way they misreport it, it's quite dangerous, I don’t want to be party to it."&lt;ref name="sarafirth"&gt;{{cite news |author=John Plunkett |title=Russia Today reporter resigns in protest at MH17 coverage |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/18/mh17-russia-today-reporter-resigns-sara-firth-kremlin-malaysia |date=18 July 2014 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In follow-up interview she said "In Ukraine, you’re taking a very small part of a much wider story, totally omitted the context of the story, and so what you wind up with on air is outright misinformation." Calling RT "mass information manipulation" Firth said "they have a very clear idea in their mind of what they’re trying to prove." She also stated that "The worst-kept secret is that RT is blatant propaganda. I’m one in a very long line of people who have left for the same reason."&lt;ref name=TIME2114/&gt;

The following November, RT was again found in breach of Ofcom's impartiality rules.

In an episode of ''The Truthseeker'', named ''Genocide of Eastern Ukraine'', they claimed that the Ukrainian government was deliberately bombing civilians, had murdered and tortured journalists, as well as crucifying babies. Ukrainian army forces were accused of "ethnic cleansing" and were compared to the Nazis in World War Two. The only response to the allegations in the broadcast was in the form of a caption saying "Kiev claims it is not committing genocide, denies casualty reports", which appeared on screen for six seconds. According to Ofcom the broadcast had "little or no counterbalance or objectivity".&lt;ref name=BBC-21Sept/&gt;

A spokesperson for the media regulator said: "Ofcom found that RT broadcast content that was either materially misleading or not duly impartial.

A report released by the US think-tank the [[RAND Corporation]] in 2016 called RT part of "a wider Russian propaganda operation" named the "Firehose of Falsehood". The paper called "Russian faux-news propaganda channels, such as RT" insidious and that "they look like news programs, and the persons appearing on them are represented as journalists and experts, making audience members much more likely to ascribe credibility to the misinformation these sources are disseminating".&lt;ref name=RAND&gt;{{citation |last1=Paul |first1=Christopher |last2=Matthews |first2= Mirriam |year=2016 |title=The Russian "Firehose of Falsehood" Propaganda Model |url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE198.html |publisher=The RAND Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Ofcom again found RT in breach of its impartiality rules, this time over coverage of the Turkish government's treatment of [[Kurds|Kurdish people]]. Two episodes of ''Going Underground'' originally broadcast in March, included claims of attacks, atrocities and [[genocide]] against the Kurds, and that "Turkey supports ISIS" without offering adequate counterbalance. RT's representatives stated the network "finds it especially difficult to obtain pro-Turkey views for its programming" because of "political tensions between Russia and Turkey following the downing of a Russian military aircraft by Turkish warplanes in November 2015".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Plunkett|first=John |title=Russia-backed channel RT censured for lack of impartiality in Turkish coverage |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/04/russia-rt-impartiality-turkey-genocidal-war-kurds |date=4 July 2016 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ofcom Broadcast Bulletin |url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/46621/issue_308.pdf |issue=308 |publisher=[[Ofcom]] |date=4 July 2016 |pp=5–30 |accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, after the [[United States presidential election, 2016|US Presidential Election]], ''The Washington Post'' reported that RT and [[Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik]] were "state-funded Russian information services that mimic the style and tone of independent news organizations yet sometimes include false and misleading stories in their reports" and also that "RT, Sputnik and other Russian sites used social-media accounts to amplify misleading stories already circulating online".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/russian-propaganda-effort-helped-spread-fake-news-during-election-experts-say/2016/11/24/793903b6-8a40-4ca9-b712-716af66098fe_story.html|title=Russian propaganda effort helped spread ‘fake news’ during election, experts say|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Post was criticized by ''[[The Intercept]]'', ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' for relying in part on an analysis by [[PropOrNot]], an anonymous organization with no reputation for fact-checking.&lt;ref name="skeptic1"&gt;{{citation|title=Washington Post Disgracefully Promotes a McCarthyite Blacklist From a New, Hidden, and Very Shady Group|date=26 November 2016|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/11/26/washington-post-disgracefully-promotes-a-mccarthyite-blacklist-from-a-new-hidden-and-very-shady-group/|author1=Ben Norton|author2=Glenn Greenwald|work=[[The Intercept]]|accessdate=27 November 2016|author-link2=Glenn Greenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skeptic2"&gt;{{citation|last=Ingram|first=Matthew|title=No, Russian Agents Are Not Behind Every Piece of Fake News You See|date=25 November 2016|url=http://fortune.com/2016/11/25/russian-fake-news/|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune magazine]]|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skeptic3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/washington-post-blacklist-story-is-shameful-disgusting-w452543|title=The 'Washington Post' 'Blacklist' Story Is Shameful and Disgusting|last=Taibbi|first=Matt|date=28 November 2016|website=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Ofcom found RT in breach of its impartiality rules for the 10th time since the English-language channel launched. A ''Crosstalk'' episode broadcast the previous July, contained a [[debate]] about the [[NATO]] [[2016 Warsaw summit]] in which all members of the panel expressed critical views. RT's representatives again stated that they couldn't find anybody with alternative opinions willing to take part, and that captions with pro-NATO comments should have been added before broadcast, but the wrong text was accidentally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams |first=Christopher |title=Media watchdog calls in Kremlin-backed news channel RT over impartiality breach on Nato |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/02/07/media-watchdog-calls-kremlin-backed-news-channel-rt-impartiality/ |date=7 February 2017 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ofcom Broadcast Bulletin |url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/96012/Issue-319-of-Ofcoms-Broadcast-and-On-Demand-Bulletin,-to-be-published-on-19-December-2016.pdf |issue=319 |publisher=[[Ofcom]] |date=19 December 2016 |pp=18–26 |accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017====
On 12 January 2017, RT was accidentally broadcast for around 10 minutes on a web stream of U.S. public affairs service [[C-SPAN]]. RT stated that while it was testing its systems in preparation for the [[inauguration of Donald Trump]], its signal was "mistakenly routed onto the primary encoder feeding C-SPAN1's signal to the internet, rather than to an unused backup."&lt;ref name="variety-rtblockfb"/&gt;

On 19 January 2017, RT stated that it had been temporarily restricted from posting media on its [[Facebook]] page until 21 January, after the service claimed that RT had infringed on the copyrights of [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Liberty]]'s Current Now TV when broadcasting a live stream of [[Barack Obama]]'s final press conference as president of the United States. Current Time TV denied that it had sent any specific complaints to Facebook, and both RT and Current Now TV stated that they had obtained their feed from the [[Associated Press]]. The restriction was removed after about 20 hours, but Facebook did not say officially if this was because of a technical error or a policy issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wong|first=Julia Carrie|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/19/facebook-russia-rt-censorship-temporary-ban|title=Russia threatens retaliation over Facebook 'censorship' of RT|work=The Guardian|date=20 January 2017|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="variety-rtblockfb"&gt;{{cite web|last=Spangler|first=Todd|title=Facebook Restores Kremlin-Funded RT Posting Privileges After Temporary Block|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/facebook-blocks-rt-posting-trump-inauguration-1201963757/|work=Variety|date=19 January 2017|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] informed RT America that it must register as a [[Foreign Agents Registration Act|foreign agent]] of the Russian government. Margarita Simonyan, RT’s editor-in-chief, condemned the action as an assault on [[freedom of speech]]. A spokesperson for the [[Russian foreign ministry]] threatened retaliatory measures against American journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia considering US media restrictions as retaliation|url=http://thehill.com/policy/international/354450-russia-considering-us-media-restrictions-as-retaliation-report|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian network RT must register as foreign agent in US|url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/350226-russian-network-rt-must-register-as-foreign-agent-in|website=The Hill|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2017, RT America officially registered as a "foreign agent" in the United States with the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] under the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]]. Under the act, RT will be required to disclose financial information.&lt;ref name=Reuters-13Nov2017&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-usa-media-restrictions-rt/russias-rt-registers-as-foreign-agent-in-usa-editor-idUSKBN1DD25B|title=Russia's RT America registers as 'foreign agent' in U.S.|date=13 November 2017|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radio Moscow''' ({{lang-rus|Pадио Москва|r=Radio Moskva}}), also known as '''Radio Moscow World Service''', was the official [[international broadcasting]] station of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] until 1993. It was reorganized with a new name: [[Voice of Russia]].,&lt;ref name="innovbusiness.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovbusiness.ru/pravo/DocumShow_DocumID_65277.html|title=Boris Yeltsin’s decree in Russian language|language=Russian|date=December 22, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has also since been reorganized and renamed [[Sputnik (news agency)|Radio Sputnik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Voice of Russia becomes Sputnik|url=http://uk.sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/news/2014_11_10/Voice-of-Russia-becomes-Sputnik-8149/|accessdate=18 November 2014|newspaper=Voice of Russia|date=10 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129050431/http://uk.sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/news/2014_11_10/Voice-of-Russia-becomes-Sputnik-8149/|archivedate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak, Radio Moscow broadcast in over 70 [[language]]s using transmitters in the Soviet Union, [[Eastern Europe]], and [[Cuba]].

Radio Moscow's [[interval signal]] was '[[Wide Is My Motherland]]' ({{lang-rus|Широка́ страна́ моя́ родна́я|r=Shiroká straná moyá rodnáya}}).

==History==

===Early years===
Its first emission in a foreign language was in [[German language|German]] on 29 October 1929, and later in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=James|title=History of International Broadcasting, Volume 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g5s_uDDZSjoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2000|publisher=Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)|location=[[United Kingdom]]|isbn=0-85296-920-1|pages=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Radio Moscow broadcast in 1922 with a transmitter station RV-1 in the [[Moscow Oblast|Moscow region]], and a second broadcasting centre came on air at [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] in 1925.&lt;ref name="wood"/&gt; By 1939, Radio Moscow was broadcasting (on [[mediumwave]] and [[shortwave]]) in English, French, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], German, [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Radio Moscow did express concern over the rise of German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] during the 1930s, and its Italian mediumwave service specifically was [[radio jamming|jammed]] by an order of Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] during the late 1930s.

===The Cold War years===
The U.S. was first targeted by Radio Moscow during the early 1950s, with transmitters in the Moscow region. Later Western North America was targeted by the newly constructed [[Vladivostok]] and [[Magadan]] relay stations.

The first broadcasts to [[Africa]] went on the air in the late 1950s in English and French.

In 1961 Radio Moscow for the first time spoke in three African languages: [[Amharic language|Amharic]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]]. Over time, listeners in Africa got a chance to tune into Radio Moscow in another eight African languages.

The first centralized news bulletin went on the air in August 1963 and reached out to listeners all over the world. In the years of the Cold War most news reports and commentaries focused on the relations between the United States and Soviet Union.

In the 1970s the cream of Radio Moscow's commentator teams united in a radio journal, called "News and Views". Taking part in the ambitious project were Viktor Glazunov, Leonid Rassadin, Yuri Shalygin, Alexander Kushnir, Yuri Solton and Vladislav Chernukha. Over the years the journal grew into a major information and analytical program of the Radio Moscow foreign service.

=== Changes late 1970s–1980s ===
In the late 1970s its English language service was renamed ''Radio Moscow World Service''. The project was launched and supervised by a long-time Radio Moscow journalist and manager Alexander Evstafiev. Later a North American service, African service and even a "UK &amp; Ireland" service (all in English) operated for a few hours per day alongside the regular (24 Hour) English World Service.

At one time in 1980, Radio Moscow had transmissions on the [[Medium Wave]] broadcast on 600&amp;nbsp;kHz (later 1040&amp;nbsp;kHz) from [[Havana, Cuba]] which reached the Caribbean islands and US State of Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1798&amp;dat=19810407&amp;id=myQeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0Y4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6705,934468&amp;hl=en|title=Radio Moscow comes in loud and clear from Cuba|date=April 7, 1981|newspaper=Sarasota Journal|first=Tom|last=Tiede|location=[[Jacksonville, Florida]]|page=8|volume=29|issue=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Moscow's shortwave (SW) transmission network has never been equalled in its transmission power, directivity and reach. During the station's peak in the 1980s the same programmes could often be heard on anything up to forty frequencies on the (heavily overcrowded) shortwave bands although the station never published its complete time/frequency schedule as radio frequencies were regarded as state secrets by the Soviet government. {{dubious|date=September 2015}}

One of the most popular programmes on air in the 1980s, due to its informal presentation that contrasted with most other shows, was the 'Listeners’ Request Club' hosted by prominent radio presenter [[Vasily Strelnikov]]. Another popular feature which began on Radio Moscow was ''Moscow Mailbag'', which answered listeners' questions in English about the Soviet Union. Since 1957, the programme was presented by [[Joe Adamov]], who was known for his command of the English language and his good humour.

=== End ===
On 22 December 1993, the [[President of Russia|Russian president]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] issued a decree which reorganized Radio Moscow with a new name: [[Voice of Russia]].&lt;ref name="innovbusiness.ru"/&gt;

== Languages ==
=== Languages of Radio Moscow ===
By 1931, when Radio Moscow came under the control of the newly established [[Radio in the Soviet Union|''Gostelradio'']], the service comprised eight languages: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|TMFDAQAAIAAJ|''СССР в мировом информационном пространстве (1917-1945 гг.)''|page=73}} (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1 language to Latin America: [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]]

==== Russian language services ====
Until 1988 there was no Russian service of Radio Moscow. Instead there were several other services for Russians abroad like the ''Fifth programme'' of the [[Radio in the Soviet Union|All-Union Radio]] (since 1960), ''Radio Motherland'' (Радиостанция Родина) of the ''Soviet Committee for Cultural Relations with Fellow-Countrymen Abroad'' or for fishermen ''Radio Pacific Ocean'' (Радиостанция Тихий Океан, 1963–2001) from [[Vladivostok]] and ''Radio Atlantic'' (Радиостанция Атлантика, 1965–2004) from [[Murmansk]].

== USSR Shortwave broadcasting innovations ==
The USSR pioneered the use of [[HRS antenna|HRS]] 8/8/1 [[antenna (radio)|antennas]] (horizontal dipole curtain, eight columns, eight rows, with electrically steerable pattern) for highly targeted shortwave broadcasting long before HRS 12/6/1 technology became available in the west. HRS 8/8/1 curtain arrays create a 10-degree beam of shortwave energy, and can provide a highly audible signal to a target area some 7,000&amp;nbsp;km away.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:RSDinar.jpg|thumb|300px|Obverse of a five thousand-dinar note of Republika Srpska of [[1993]]]] --&gt;
The '''dinar''' was the currency of the [[Republika Srpska]] between 1992 and 1994, during and following the [[Bosnian War]]. There were two distinct currencies issued by the National Bank of the Republika Srpska. The first was introduced in 1992 in conjunction with the [[Yugoslav dinar]] of that year, to which it was equal. The second was introduced on October 1, 1993, replacing the first at a rate of one million to one and matching the revaluation of the Yugoslav currency. Following this, the Republika Srpska used [[Yugoslav dinar|Yugoslav currency]] (first the "1994 dinar" and then "novi dinar") until 1998, when the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark|convertible mark]] was introduced.

The two currencies were only issued in note form, with the first issued in denominations of 10 dinars up to 10 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] dinars and the second in denominations of 5000 dinars up to 50 billion dinars. The designs of the banknotes varied very little within the issues of the two currencies. The "1992 dinar" notes featured the arms of the republic on both sides, whilst the "1993 dinar" notes had a portrait of [[Petar Kočić]] on the obverse. Some of the issues in 1993 were overprints on 1992 banknotes.

The term '''royal city''' denotes a [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] that some cities in [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] enjoyed during the [[Middle Ages]].  It meant the city was an inalienable part of the royal estate; the king could not sell or pledge the city.  At the beginning of the 16th Century, about 40 cities enjoyed this privilege.  The citizens of these cities had a higher position in the [[estates of the realm]] than any other subjects.

A similar status was the {{lang|de|Lehnstadt}} (plural {{lang|de|Lehnstädte}}); these were a source of income for the Queen.  Another source of income for the king were cities with the status of {{lang|de|Kammerstadt}} (plural {{lang|de|Kammerstädte}}), but these were not inalienable and had a lesser status.  These cities had a duty of [[socage]].  Originally, this meant that each citizen had to work the kings land a certain number of days each year, but this was soon replaced by a cash payment.

== Citizens of the royal cities ==
Citizens of the royal cities had a special social status.  It took a legal deed to become citizen.  If the applicant purchased a home, or lived in the city for a long time, or could prove "good" ancestry and a decent family life and, if he had been a subject, could show a release certificate, then the applicant had a chance to be admitted to this privileged class. There were other ways to obtain this status: one could purchase it, or marry into it.  Sometimes a city would offer citizenship, especially to educated inhabitants.

The precise rights and duties of the citizens differed considerably from city to city.  They depended on the status of the city.  Even among the citizens, there was a hierarchy, which was reflected in income, the order at the Last Supper and the seat in the church, but also at the location of the house.

'''SANAE''' is the '''South African National Antarctic Expedition'''. The name refers both to the overwintering bases (numbered in [[Roman numerals]], e.g. [[SANAE IV]]), and the team spending the winter (numbered in [[Arabic numerals]], e.g. SANAE 47). The current base, SANAE IV, is located at [[Vesleskarvet]] in [[Queen Maud Land]], [[Antarctica]]. Summer teams comprise administrative and maintenance personnel, helicopter crew and scientists from various countries and can be up to 100 people. Overwintering teams consist of scientists and support personnel from [[South Africa]], typically totalling 10 members in recent years.

The research programme at the SANAE IV base is carried out under the auspices of the [[South African National Antarctic Programme]] (SANAP).

[[File:SANAE IV from above the northern buttress.jpg|thumb|SANAE IV]]

==History==
The first expedition, SANAE 1, overwintered at [[Norway Station]], taken over by South Africa from [[Norway]] after the end of the [[International Geophysical Year|IGY]]. Later teams overwintered at SANAE I, SANAE II and SANAE III, built on the [[Fimbul Ice Shelf]] near the [[Blåskimen Island]]. Built on the moving ice shelf, these stations inevitably got buried, and eventually broke off as part of [[icebergs]] drifting away. Successive stations were always repositioned at the same geographical position of S 70º18 W 2º22. [[SANAE IV]] was built on the [[nunatak]] [[Vesleskarvet]] in the hope of having a base with a longer lifetime. The first team to overwinter at SANAE IV was SANAE 36 in 1997. The base has been manned uninterruptedly since then.

'''SES Americom''' was a major commercial [[communications satellite|satellite]] operator of North American geosynchronous satellites based in the [[United States]]. The company started as '''RCA Americom''' in 1975 before being bought by [[General Electric]] in 1986 and then later acquired by [[SES S.A.]] in 2001. In September 2009,  SES Americom and SES New Skies merged into SES World Skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/200909074652/ses-re-brands-international-divisions.html|title=SES re-brands international divisions|publisher=Rapidtvnews.com|date=7 September 2009|accessdate=10 September 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720000323/http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/200909074652/ses-re-brands-international-divisions.html|archivedate=20 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
RCA American Communications (RCA Americom) was founded in 1975 as an operator of [[RCA Astro Electronics]]-built satellites. The company's first satellite; [[Satcom (satellite)|Satcom 1]], was launched on December 12, 1975. Satcom 1 was one of the earliest geostationary satellites.

Satcom 1 was instrumental in helping early cable TV channels (such as [[Superstation TBS]] and [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]]) to become initially successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local cable TV [[Cable television headend|headends]] using the satellite.  Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast TV networks in the United States, like [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], and [[CBS]], to distribute their programming to all of their local affiliate stations. Satcom 1 was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing [[Westar 1]] (24 transponders as opposed to Westar 1’s 12), which resulted in lower transponder usage costs.

14 more (increasingly sophisticated) Satcom satellites would enter service from 1976 to 1992. In 1986 [[General Electric]] acquired RCA and renamed the Americom unit to GE American Communications (GE Americom). From 1996 new satellites were named in the GE-# series, i.e. GE-1 in 1996, GE-2 in 1997 etc.

===SES purchase===
In November 2001, GE sold its GE Americom unit to SES for $5 billion in cash and stock. As a result of the sale, GE Americom was renamed SES Americom and SES Global was formed as the parent company. SES's existing operations were moved to the newly created SES Astra subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Satellite Unit Of GE Capital Is Being Sold|date=November 12, 2001|publisher=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/29/business/technology-satellite-unit-of-ge-capital-is-being-sold.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SES Global completes acquisition of GE Americom|date=November 12, 2001|publisher=telecompaper|url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/ses-global-completes-acquisition-of-ge-americom--284723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the acquisition of GE Americom by SES, all the satellites previously named with the GE-# prefix were renamed AMC-# (i.e., GE-1 renamed AMC-1, and so on).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE 7, 8 / AMC 7, 8, 10, 11, 18 (Aurora 3)|date=July 21, 2015|publisher=Gunter's space page|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/ge-7.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
