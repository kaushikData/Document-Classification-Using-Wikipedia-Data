'''Barker–Lane Stadium''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Buies Creek, North Carolina]]. The stadium is located on the campus of [[Campbell University]] and hosts the school's [[American football]] program.  The stadium was scheduled to be completed in stages with the first stage to include the field, the field house, the main entrance, the bowl, seating for 5,000 spectators and necessary road realignment. Barker-Lane received a major expansion in 2013 with the construction of the West stand that increased capacity to 5,500. The newly constructed West stand includes seating for 3,000, with 867 chair back seats plus additional bleacher back seats, an 80-foot tall press box, new restrooms, and new concession facilities. In 2016, a state-of-the-art high-definition Daktronics video board was added to the North endzone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gocamels.com/sports/2017/7/14/facilities-Barker-LaneStadium.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, new field turf was installed with a completely revamped midfield logo just in time for the 2018 Campbell Fighting Camels season kickoff. The first scoring play in Barker–Lane Stadium was a field goal kicked by Adam Willets. Barker-Lane Stadium is considered by many to have one of the best gameday atmospheres in all of Division I FCS football. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gocamels.com/news/2016/1/6/1_6_2016_1826.aspx?path=football}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their six home games last fall, the Fighting Camels averaged a sellout crowd with 5,523 fans per game. By drawing 101 percent over its capacity of 5,500, Barker-Lane Stadium ranked in the Top 10 in all Division I football — both the FCS and FBS — in attendance over capacity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://magazine.campbell.edu/articles/the-big-time/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3330">The '''Best Soccer Player''' category of the [[ESPY Award]] was presented in 2000, 2001, 2005, and 2006 to the [[football (soccer)|soccer]] ([[association football]]) player adjudged to be the best in a given [[calendar year]] amongst those contesting the sport on the [[professional sports|professional]] or [[FIFA|international]] level, irrespective of gender or nation represented. The award was bifurcated in [[2002 ESPY Awards|2002]], but the resulting [[Best Male Soccer Player ESPY Award|Best Male]] and [[Best Female Soccer Player ESPY Award]]s were joined once more in 2005.  The award was effectively discontinued in 2005 and replaced by the [[Best MLS Player ESPY Award]] (which was first awarded in 2006), as the 2006 award went to a worlwide star not to an American as in the previous years.

During the award's three years, the voting panel comprised variously [[fan (aficionado)|fans]], who participated through [[Internet]] balloting; [[sports journalism|sportswriter]]s and [[Sports presenter|broadcaster]]s, sports [[general manager#Sports teams|executives]], and retired [[sportsperson]]s, termed collectively ''experts''; and [[List of ESPN personalities|ESPN personalities]]. The [[ESPY Awards#Ceremonies|ESPY Awards ceremony]] was conducted in February and awards conferred reflected performance and achievement over the twelve months previous to presentation. Since 2005, voting was undertaken exclusively by fans over the Internet from amongst nominees selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee, and awards have been presented in July to reflect performance and achievement over the twelve months previous to presentation.

Chandrasekharan Nair]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keralapolicehistory.com/sprts1.html keralapolicehistory] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031071841/http://www.keralapolicehistory.com/sprts1.html |date=31 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It hosts both national and international level matches.

'''Charterhouse''' is an [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent]] day and [[boarding school]] in [[Godalming]], [[Surrey]]. Founded by [[Thomas Sutton]] in 1611 on the site of the old [[Carthusian]] monastery in [[Charterhouse Square]], [[Smithfield, London]], it educates over 800 pupils, aged 13 to 18 years, and is one of the original Great Nine English [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]s. Today pupils are still referred to as Carthusians, and ex-pupils as [[List of Old Carthusians|Old Carthusians]].

Charterhouse charges full boarders up to £39,165 per annum (2018/19)&lt;ref&gt;Charterhouse.

The school has admitted girls to the Specialists (Sixth Form) since 1971. In 2017, it announced that it is to move to full co-education from the age of 13, and will admit girls into Year 9 from September 2021. There will be girls in every year group from September 2023.&lt;ref name="charterhouse.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.charterhouse.org.uk/news/news-detail/~board/general/post/full-coeducation-at-charterhouse|title=Full coeducation at Charterhouse|publisher=|access-date=12 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012214511/https://www.charterhouse.org.uk/news/news-detail/~board/general/post/full-coeducation-at-charterhouse|archive-date=12 October 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Update|section|date=November 2018}}
[[File:Thomas Sutton statue.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Thomas Sutton]] on Founder's Court]]
In May 1611, the London Charterhouse came into the hands of [[Thomas Sutton]] (1532–1611) of [[Knaith]], Lincolnshire. He acquired a fortune by the discovery of coal on two estates which he had leased near [[Newcastle-on-Tyne]], and afterwards, removing to London, he carried on a commercial career. In 1611, the year of his death, he endowed a hospital on the site of the Charterhouse, calling it the hospital of King James, and in his will he bequeathed moneys to maintain a chapel, hospital ([[almshouse]]) and school.  He died on 12 December and subsequently the will was hotly contested but upheld in court, and the foundation was finally constituted to afford a home for eighty male pensioners (gentlemen by descent and in poverty, soldiers that have borne arms by sea or land, merchants decayed by piracy or shipwreck, or servants in household to the King or Queens Majesty), and to educate forty boys.

[[File:London Charterhouse 26.jpg|thumb|right|Brooke Hall at Charterhouse]]
Charterhouse established a reputation for excellence in hospital care and treatment, thanks in part to [[Henry Levett]], an Oxford graduate who joined the school as a physician in 1712. Levett was widely esteemed for his medical writings, including an early tract on the treatment of smallpox. Levett was buried in Charterhouse Chapel and his widow married Andrew Tooke, the master of Charterhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9RIJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=%22henry+levett%22+charterhouse&amp;source=web&amp;ots=UrPwCJ6g8h&amp;sig=cogs9fe5CtuDXMAqlNwFVg6rRms&amp;hl=en#PPA21,M1 |title=The Roll of the Royal College of Physicians of London – Royal College of Physicians of London – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ga8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22henry+levett%22+charterhouse&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JGUi-Dn7ID&amp;sig=OXXcDHCNT_LjnmI50BrZH0E3R4A&amp;hl=en |title=The Roll of the Royal College of Physicians of London: 1701 to 1800 – William Munk, G. H. Brown – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was moved to its present site in 1872 by the then headmaster, the Reverend [[William Haig Brown]] – a decision influenced by the findings of the [[Clarendon Commission]] of 1864.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charterhouse.org.uk/about/history/charterhouse_history.asp] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225070050/http://www.charterhouse.org.uk/about/history/charterhouse_history.asp |date=25 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school bought a 68-acre (270,000&amp;nbsp;m²) site atop a hill just outside Godalming. In addition to the main school buildings (designed by architect [[Philip Charles Hardwick]]), they constructed three boarding houses, known as Saunderites (once the headmaster's house, pronounced "sarnderites" rather than "sornderites"), Verites and Gownboys (for scholars, who were entitled to wear gowns). The school was built by [[Lucas Brothers (company)|Lucas Brothers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/49439 |title=Charles Lucas |publisher=Oxforddnb.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also built the Royal Albert Hall and Covent Garden.

As pupil numbers grew, other houses were built alongside the approach road, now known as Charterhouse Hill. Each was titled with an adaptation of the name of their first housemaster, such as Weekites, Daviesites and Girdlestoneites. The last of these is still referred to as Duckites, reflecting the unusual gait of its original housemaster, even though he retired well over 100 years ago. There are now the original four 'old' houses plus eight 'new' houses, making twelve boarding houses in total. The twelve [[House system|Houses]] have preserved a unique identity (each with its own tie and colours) and pupils compete against each other in both sports and the arts.

The school continued to expand over the 20th century. Further land was bought to the north and west, increasing the grounds to over 200 acres (809,000&amp;nbsp;m²), and a new school chapel was designed by Sir [[Giles Gilbert Scott]] (perhaps best known for designing the [[red telephone box]]) and consecrated in 1927 to commemorate almost 700 pupils who died in the [[First World War]], making it the largest war memorial in England. Around 350 names have been subsequently added to commemorate those who died in the [[Second World War]] and other more recent conflicts. Most still attend a short chapel service there six times a week. The school also keeps a small archives library opposite the History block, where it is traditional for Fourths (Year 9) to do an archives project about a particular Old Carthusian killed in the First World War.

An addition to the campus was seven new Houses, built in the 1970s, replacing late Victorian boarding houses which were demolished in 1977. Other newer buildings include the Art Studio, the [[John Derry]] Technology Centre, the [[Ben Travers]] Theatre, the [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] Music Centre, the Halford Hewitt Golf Course, the Queen's Sports Centre, the Sir Greville Spratt athletics track and Chetwynd, a hall of residence for girls. In 2003, the School renovated its onsite Library. 2006 saw the opening of The Beveridge Centre for the Social Sciences. In 2007, a £3m Modern Languages building was completed.

The school has a top 60 placing in the [[A level]] league tables, and in 2011 over 80% of pupils are awarded an A* or A grade at [[GCSE]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} In 2009, the school announced its decision to switch from [[A Level]]s to the [[International Baccalaureate]] and [[Cambridge Pre-U]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/s/2043836_schools_ditching_alevels_for_diploma_programme?related_link |title=Schools ditching A-levels for diploma programme |publisher=Getsurrey.co.uk |date=2009-01-28 |accessdate=2015-04-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224004420/http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/s/2043836_schools_ditching_alevels_for_diploma_programme?related_link |archive-date=24 February 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Charterhouse had its best set of Cambridge Pre-U results with 96% of examinations taken awarded Distinction or Merit grades. Seventy-eight pupils achieved Distinctions (or their A level equivalent) in all subjects taken and twenty-one achieved the equivalent of A level A* grades in all their subjects. Twenty pupils were offered places at Oxford or Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charterhouse.org.uk/ExaminationResults |title=Examination REsults |publisher=Charterhouse.org.uk |accessdate=2015-04-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004223908/http://www.charterhouse.org.uk/ExaminationResults |archive-date=4 October 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Roy Hattersley]], former Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and minister, reported on a visit to Charterhouse in the Guardian newspaper. After describing his impression that "[The chapel]'s geometric spires and minarets proclaim complete confidence that Charterhouse educates men who are destined to rule the universe", he said: "Academically and pastorally, it is near to beyond criticism. And after only a brief glimpse of the school, I have no doubt that I would have been ecstatically happy there. But its existence allows the rich and the powerful to ignore the world beyond its boundaries." He therefore concluded that his aspiration to abolish private education in the 1970s was "totally justified".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jul/17/publicschools.schools | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Roy | last=Hattersley | title=Roy Hattersley visits Charterhouse | date=17 July 2007 | access-date=11 December 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230163845/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jul/17/publicschools.schools | archive-date=30 December 2016 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 Ofsted Social Care Inspection Report noted that 'The provision for "Helping children achieve well and enjoy what they do" is rated as outstanding.' and 'This is a good school, in which boarders' welfare is promoted by a strong approach to countering bullying and child protection. Boarding staff have good relationships with the boarders, and boarders can list a range of people who they can talk to if they are worried or have concerns.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/files/1301557/urn/SC013907.pdf |format=PDF |title=Charterhouse : Inspection report for boarding school|publisher=Ofsted.gov.uk |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 Independent Schools Inspectorate Report noted that 'The quality of pupils' achievements is excellent. Pupils are extremely well educated. They attain extremely high standards in external examinations and make exceptional progress in their learning because of their positive attitudes to study, dedicated and often inspiring teaching, and an academically challenging curriculum that is adapted to suit all needs. The curriculum is enriched by an outstanding range of activities'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isi.net/schools/6319/ |title=Charterhouse – ISI – Independent Schools Inspectorate |publisher=ISI.net |date= |accessdate=2015-04-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515231551/http://www.isi.net/schools/6319/ |archive-date=15 May 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 ISI Educational Quality Inspection Report noted that ‘Pupils' academic and other achievements are high and often exceptional. Pupils' successes in external competitions, in academic distinctions and in sport, music and the creative and aesthetic arts are exceptional. Pupils' social development is outstanding. Pupils are polite, courteous and respectful of one another and of the adults who care for them. Relationships between pupils and staff are excellent. Pupils mature into independent and self-motivated pupils over the course of their time at school and are extremely well prepared, not only for the next stage of their lives, but also to contribute to society at large.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.charterhouse.org.uk/about-us/isi-inspection-reports|title=ISI Inspection Reports – Charterhouse|website=www.charterhouse.org.uk|access-date=12 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012214522/https://www.charterhouse.org.uk/about-us/isi-inspection-reports|archive-date=12 October 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the school announced that it is moving to full co-education from the age of 13, and will welcome the first girls into Year 9 in September 2021. There will be girls in every year group from September 2023.&lt;ref name="charterhouse.org.uk"/&gt;

== School terms ==
There are three academic terms (known as '''Quarters''') in the year,
* The '''Oration Quarter (OQ)''', from early September to mid December.
* The '''Long Quarter (LQ)''', from mid January to late March. Therefore, it traditionally had the distinction of being the shortest third of the school year, despite its name.
* The '''Cricket Quarter (CQ)''', from late April to late June or early July.

== Houses ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
There are four old [[House system|boarding houses]] and eight new houses in White List (a directory of names) order. In Charterhouse vocabulary an ''old'' house is one which was founded in the early years of the school, as opposed to the ''new'' houses which were created later and are situated away from the main school. They are all distinguished by the colour of the pupils' ties, umbrellas and football team's stripes.

[[File:Charterhouse Cloisters.JPG|thumb|right|Cloisters]]
The newest house, Fletcherites, named after Frank Fletcher, a former headmaster, was opened in autumn 2010 for sixth-form pupils.  The house moved into the old Great Comp building, now renovated.
Verites, Saunderites and Gownboys houses predate the move to Godalming in 1872 and are known as the "block" houses. However, Girdlestoneites is now treated as one of the "old houses" because it, along with Verites, Saunderites and Gownboys, are the only houses still in their 1870s buildings, while all the rest are in their 1970s replacements. Saunderites is named after its first Housemaster Dr. Saunders (Headmaster 1832–53) and it was the Headmaster's house, in that the headmaster would not only run the school but one of the houses. Unfortunately, the dramatic increase in the size of the school and the increasing difficulties in running such a school have meant that the Headmaster can no longer do this. Gownboys was named not after their original housemaster, but because it was the scholars' house, although scholars were distributed across all the houses after the transfer to Godalming. As was tradition, scholars wore gowns with their uniform and were treated as superior to other boys. There is no longer such a tradition and the scholars are now distributed throughout the various houses, on a random but numerically equal basis. There are still scholars in Gownboys, but in no greater proportion than any other house.

Verites is a contraction of Oliverites (Oliver Walford, School Usher 1838–55) and hence 'Verites' is pronounced as if the 'Ver' is from Oliver not as from 'very'. The records of the house run back to the start of the last century, but previously it was just called 'Boarders House No.2'. Girdlestonites' first housemaster was Frederick Girdlestone, who was said to walk like a duck. Girdlestonites has therefore been unofficially known as 'Duckites' ever since, but since this was 'insulting' slang it was never written down or used officially. This latter restriction has now largely fallen by the wayside and even the school magazine uses ''Duckites'' in print occasionally.

All new Houses apart from Bodeites are named after their founders (although Robinites was originally Robinsonites). Bodeites was originally Buissonites, named after the Head of Languages at the time. He ran off with the matron, and so the house was renamed Bodeites after the replacement, Mr Bode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodeites.com/article.aspx?id=64]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This did lead to some confusion at the time of naming the houses because some housemasters moved to houses named after their colleagues.

Robinites was a 'back passage house' when the school first moved to Godalming and boys stayed there for no more than two years until they could be transferred to one of the other houses. It now has normal status. There was also another passage house known as Laleham, but this has ceased to exist.

All pupils belong to one of the 12 houses, and boarding boys will sleep in the boarding house; their housemaster will live in "private side" attached to the house. Charterhouse has traditionally had very few day boys. In the 1870s the statutes of the school limited them to 10 (excluding sons of masters) and even in the late 1980s the number was only around 25 (some of whom were the sons of masters). Boarding girls are assigned a House and are fully involved in House life but at night, they sleep in halls of residence (e.g. Chetwynd) which are not treated as houses.  These halls of residence are more modern than the 'new' Houses.

Teachers belong to ''Brooke Hall'' (the teachers' common room building).

''Uskites'' was a temporary house opened in 1872 by Mr Stewart, the writing and chemistry instructor from the old Charterhouse. It was closed in 1878 and the pupils redistributed. The building itself (on Peperharow Road) was bought by a schoolmaster, and later used by the School as a sanatorium. It is now masters' accommodation. Mr Stewart named the house because he likened the valley of the River Wey (where the house lies) with the valley of the River Usk.

== Memorial Chapel ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}

[[File:Charterhouse Chapel DSC 2148.jpg|thumb|275px|The Memorial Chapel]]
Memorial Chapel, designed by Sir [[Giles Gilbert Scott]] and consecrated in 1927, commemorates the Carthusians who died in action: 700 in [[World War I]] and 350 in [[World War II]]. The whole School meets here three days each week for a short service at 8:30 am, and on Sundays for Evensong, Matins, or a School Eucharist. On Sundays, when there is an Evening service, [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] pupils may instead attend Mass in the Founder's Chapel. Parents are welcome at Sunday services, but tickets are required for Remembrance Sunday and the Carol Service.

Friday morning chapel is reserved for congregational singing practice. Attendance at all chapel services is compulsory, except where individual exemptions are granted on religious grounds.

Chapel provides a variety of worship experience: hymn-singing; Psalm chanting; the choir performs a repertoire of Church Music; Candle-lit Carols; Eucharists in Millennium Chapel; [[Remembrance Sunday]] with the sounding of The Last Post and The Silence.

Each year there is a Confirmation Service in late January and pupils from any year group except the Fourths (who hadn't been at the school when it was open to sign up) can be prepared for this.

The school retains the old chapel used by the school prior to 1927. However, when the school first moved to Godalming even this was not built, and the pupils walked the 2 miles to Shackleford Church. Pupils ever since have benefited, because the time taken for the walk ruled out the continuance of Sunday school, which ran from 10am to 10:30 on Sundays, which has remained a non-teaching day ever since.

* '''Under School'''
The Lower School consists of the first three years of attendance at Charterhouse, being the Fourth Form, the Removes and the Fifth Form (GCSE year). Pupils in Lower School wear a weekday uniform consisting of a white or blue shirt, house tie, grey trousers, blue jumper, tweed jacket and leather shoes. Sunday dress consists of a dark suit of pinstriped or plain design. A waistcoat is optional. Variations include various society and school honours' ties.

Transition from the Lower School to the Upper School occurs upon successful completion of the GCSE exams.

* '''Specialists ('The Upper School')'''
The Specialists (Lower and Upper Sixth Forms) constitute the last two years of attendance at Charterhouse, and form the Upper School. Having completed the GCSE exams successfully, 'First &amp; Second Year Specialists' (as they are colloquially referred) spend two years studying for their 'A-Level' examinations, usually in three subjects, although some students will read for four or five.

Specialists have their own variations on School Dress. Instead of a tweed jacket, Specialists wear a navy blue blazer with gold or blue buttons on the sleeves. Sunday dress remains the same as in the Lowerer School. Historically, those in Gownboys were permitted to wear gowns as a mark of their scholarly status, but this is no longer permitted, as Gownboys is not the only house in which scholars reside. Specialists may also wear pink shirts and silver or nickel cuff-links.

Whether in Lower or Upper School, any pupil who has been awarded his House or School 'Colours' for sport or culture, may wear his 'Colours' tie in place of his house tie. School monitors may also wear their monitor tie instead of a house tie, if they so choose. For further on this, please see below, under "School Honours".

* '''Summer dresses'''
During Cricket Quarter, the school uniform can vary slightly from that of the two preceding terms. Boys may wear cravats in house colours instead of ties and are permitted to wear straw Boaters similar to the 'Harrow Hat' found at [[Harrow School]], but these are almost never worn by the majority of pupils. Boys in the Under School may also wear navy blazers similar to those worn by the Specialists. As well as these variations, boys may roll up their sleeves in hashes unless asked not to by a beak.

*''Members of the 1st XI Cricket Team have their own variation on summer dress which is described later in the article.''
* '''School Honours'''
School Honours is the Colours system rewarding pupils in various fields with variations on school dress. They are as follows:

'''House colours''' – House colours are a variation on the house tie. Colours awarded for house sport prowess have thicker stripes in the House colour, whereas those awarded for cultural prowess have thin doubled striped.

'''School colours''' – School colours are awarded for services to School sport, culture and other areas deemed worthy. They all have a similar design and are covered in Sutton's Crests (The crest of Thomas Sutton). However, they come in varying colours:
''The Head of School'' – The Head of School (head boy) is permitted to wear a Pink tie adorned with Sutton Crests, sometimes reversed.
''1st XI Major Sports'' – Members of the 1st Team in major school sports (football, hockey and cricket) are permitted to wear maroon ties.
''Minor Sports'' – Holders of colours in Minor Sports are permitted to wear a silver tie covered in Sutton Hospital Crests.
''Academic/Scholars'' – Holders of Academic or Scholars colours are permitted to wear a [[Cambridge Blue]] tie or bow tie with Sutton Crests.
''Culture'' – Those deemed worthy enough in cultural fields are permitted to wear a purple tie.
''Service'' – Brown ties are awarded for commendable service to the school community. Most frequently they are awarded by the [[Combined Cadet Force|CCF]].

'''1st XI Cricket''' – Members of the 1st XI Cricket team are permitted to wear pink blazers with Sutton's Crest on the front pocket to Hashes on match days (usually Saturdays).

'''Greyhounds''' – Every year a few Carthusians are given Greyhound awards for outstanding service to the school. Those awarded the prize are permitted to wear a navy blue tie with rampant gold greyhounds.

'''Academic – '''Pupils who have gained distinctive academic achievements are awarded the Academic Tie and are referred as Scholars of the school. They are permitted to wear a Cambridge Blue tie with the Sutton Crest.

'''Culture''' – Pupils who have contributed to the school distinctively in terms of culture (music, drama etc.) are awarded the Culture Tie, which has a deep purple colour with the Sutton Crest.

== Events ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
[[Image:chousegreen.jpg|thumb|250px|March around Green at the end of CQ]]
[[Image:chousebagpipes.jpg|thumb|Bagpipe Players on Leavers Day]]

Carthusian Day is the main social event of the school calendar. It is held on day preceding the [[Exeat]] in CQ and Sunday dress is worn. The day is intended for the parents and families of Carthusians to visit the school. Speeches are made and Sports events played: including the annual Cricket and Golf matches between Carthusians and Old Carthusians. It also gives parents the chance to see their sons' and daughters' work (such as the traditional Archives project done by Fourths on old Carthusians killed in World War I).

Founder's Day is celebrated every year to commemorate the founding of the school and to thank the founder and benefactor Thomas Sutton. It is considered one of the most important days of the year and is held on the last day of OQ. The day consists of 'clearing up' in houses before 'Founders Feast', a large feast for the whole school where [[Black Tie]] is worn. The feast is followed by games and activities.

St. Andrew's Day is celebrated by an annual ball hosted by the historical 'Scottish Dancing society. On St. Andrews Day pupils are permitted to wear traditional Scottish dress including a [[Kilt]], [[Ghillie suit|Ghillies]] and a [[Sporran]].

'The 50 Mile Walk' is an annual event for the 1st Year specialists held at the end of CQ. It consists of walking a {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch from Brighton to the Brooke Hall arch and taking regular Hashes the next day. The March originates from the 1950s when the American Navy SEALs challenged the School, saying that only they could walk {{convert|50|mi|km}} and go to work the next day. Those who complete the walk in less than 24 Hours are awarded a special '50' tie, which until 2006 consisted of a navy blue tie with the school crest that has a '50' written below it. The current tie is a thickly striped affair in Pink (for the school), Green (for the countryside) and Blue (for the night)

Leavers' Day is the last day of CQ when the Second Year Specialists come to the end of their school careers. After the Leavers Chapel, the entire school does 2 lap around 'Green' while several men dressed in Scottish traditional Scottish dress play the bagpipes. The leaving Second Year Specialists do an extra lap signifying their loyalty to the school.

'Lack of Talent' is an annual show of Carthusian musical talent and sketches run entirely by pupils and held in the BTT during the start of OQ. It is usually hosted by two second year Specialists and acts are selected by a panel of pupils in the Second Year Specialists. Such acts are predominantly music based, however comedy sketches have become increasingly popular (as they were a large part of the original Lack of Talent in 2000) with many of the staff looking forward to the Brooke Hall parody sketch that has become a regular feature. It is one of the few productions in the school's theatre that students and visitors have to pay a fee to see, originally with the concept this would go to global, less obvious charities and raise peoples awareness of their causes.

== Monitors ==
Monitors are chosen pupils who are deemed to have the best qualities in leadership and achievement. Each house has at least one monitor, who is appointed Head of House (the most senior pupil in house). On a school-wide level one monitor is appointed the Head of School, and a deputy is appointed to assist. Monitors may wear Navy blue ties and Navy scarves with an embroidered crest. Monitors are also permitted to ride bikes to and from hashes as well as out of Hash time.

== House Apostles ==
The Headmaster's Essay Society, also known as the 'House Apostles' is a historical society of twelve Carthusians deemed to be the most intellectual in the school. It is the most exclusive club to get into at Charterhouse. The students are invited by the Headmaster to present papers on chosen subjects on Monday evenings and meetings are held in the Headmaster's House. All members are allowed to wear [[Cambridge Blue]] Academic ties or scarfs.

== Sports ==

Today, pupils take part in a range of sporting activities. The former England [[batsman]] and captain [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]] was educated at Charterhouse. [[Martin Bicknell]], the former [[Surrey]] and England seam bowler joined the school as head of cricket following his retirement from the sport in 2006.

In 1999–2000, the Charterhouse first XI reached the final of the [[Independent Schools Football Association|ISFA]] Cup, after winning all their previous rounds away from home, but were narrowly beaten 0–1 in the final at the Leicester City ground by [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]].  The school first XI of the year 2006–7 again reached the ISFA cup final, losing on penalties after a one-all draw with [[Hampton School|Hampton]]. One year later, the school first XI again qualified for the ISFA cup final against Millfield. Because of poor weather conditions, it was decided that the match would be played on one of Charterhouse's pitches instead of the usual [[Walkers Stadium]] or the replacement at Woking F.C. stadium. The team won this match on penalties. In March 2011, the school reached another ISFA final, a fixture with [[Eton College|Eton]] after knocking out Repton and Millfield in the quarter and semi-final respectively. They ran out comfortable 2–0 winners on the day.

=== Origins of football ===
Charterhouse has an historic joint claim to having founded Association Football, which remains the main Winter sport at the school. During the 1840s at both Charterhouse and [[Westminster School]] pupils' surroundings meant they were confined to playing their football in the [[cloisters]], making the rough and tumble of the handling game that was developing at other schools such as [[Rugby School|Rugby]] impossible, and necessitating a new code of rules. During the formulation of the rules of the Association Football in the 1860s representatives of Charterhouse and Westminster School pushed for a passing game, in particular rules that allowed forward passing ("passing on"). Other schools (in particular [[Eton College]], [[Shrewsbury School]] and [[Harrow School|Harrow]]) favoured a dribbling game with a tight off-side rule. It is claimed that [[History of Stoke City F.C.|Stoke Ramblers]] was formed in 1863 when former pupils of Charterhouse School formed a football club while apprentices at the [[North Staffordshire Railway]] works in [[Stoke-on-Trent]].&lt;ref name="1863-1888"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stokecityfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10310~401090,00.html|title=1863–1888 in the Beginning|publisher=[[Stoke City F.C.]]|accessdate=22 June 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019231021/http://www.stokecityfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10310~401090%2C00.html|archivedate=19 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1867 [[the Football Association]] had chosen in favour of the Charterhouse and Westminster game and adopted a "loose" off-side rule that permitted forward passing.&lt;ref&gt;Marples, Morris. A History of Football, Secker and Warburg, London 1954, page 150&lt;/ref&gt; The modern forward-passing game was a direct consequence of Charterhouse and Westminster football.

In the early years of the [[FA Cup]], teams formed of ex-pupils from these schools dominated the competition. The [[Old Carthusians F.C.]] (the name for the team composed of Charterhouse alumni) won the cup in the 1880–81 season, beating the Old Etonians in the final, and were semi-finalists in the two years that followed. The public school system also provided many of the first England internationals. They included [[Charles Wreford-Brown]], who is often credited for inventing the word "soccer". He was a pupil at Charterhouse in the early 1880s, and played football for the Old Carthusians and for the national side in the 1890s, including several appearances as captain.

During the past few years, Charterhouse has performed well in the [[Independent Schools Football Association]] cup. In 2007, Charterhouse were runners-up but in 2008 they were able to beat Millfield and win the cup. They had another success in 2010 with a 2–0 victory in the final over Eton College.

===Cricket ground===
The first recorded match on the school [[cricket]] ground came in 1859, when the school played [[Marlborough College]]. From its inception, the school has used the ground to take on a number of colleges in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/498_misc.html|title=OTHER MATCHES PLAYED ON CHARTERHOUSE SCHOOL, GODALMING (287)|publisher=Cricketarchive.com|date=|accessdate=2015-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528052534/https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/498_misc.html|archive-date=28 May 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cricket ground has held a single [[List-A cricket|List-A]] match, which was played between [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] and [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] in the 1972 [[John Player League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/498_a.html |title=LIST A MATCHES PLAYED ON CHARTERHOUSE SCHOOL, GODALMING (1) |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date=1972-05-28 |accessdate=2015-04-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528052607/https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/498_a.html |archive-date=28 May 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2006, the ground has held a number of Surrey Second XI fixtures in the [[Second XI Championship]] and Second XI Trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/498_sec.html |title=SECOND XI CHAMPIONSHIP MATCHES PLAYED ON CHARTERHOUSE SCHOOL, GODALMING (3) |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528052322/https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/498_sec.html |archive-date=28 May 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/498_set.html|title=SECOND XI TROPHY MATCHES PLAYED ON CHARTERHOUSE SCHOOL, GODALMING (5)|publisher=Cricketarchive.com|date=|accessdate=2015-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528052303/https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/498_set.html|archive-date=28 May 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herbarium==
The School's [[Herbarium]] carries the Index Herbariorum designation GOD and is maintained as The Charterhouse School Herbarium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/god/ |title=University and Jepson Herbaria |publisher=Ucjeps.berkeley.edu |date=2007-08-10 |accessdate=2015-04-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607151323/http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/god/ |archive-date=7 June 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[University and Jepson Herbaria]], [[University of California, Berkeley]].

The scope of the collections is mainly the British Isles, although some plants are from Europe, South Africa and eastern North America. The principal collectors were James Edward Moxon, Rev. George Brown Moxon, Rev. Tullie Cornthwaite, Rev. Samuel Titmas (first curator of Charterhouse Museum), Frederick Yorke Brocas, [[Andrew Bloxam]], William Gardiner, [[James Buckman]] and [[John Drew Salmon]].

== Fees ==
In any given year, there is some contention about which is the most expensive public school in England, depending on whether one compares day fees or boarding fees. In December 2012 Charterhouse was reported to be the fifth most expensive for boarding pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geraldinehackett.com/the-schools-that-charge-30000-plus-a-year/ |title=The top ten most expensive schools in the UK |publisher=Geraldinehackett.com |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2015-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401015249/http://www.geraldinehackett.com/the-schools-that-charge-30000-plus-a-year/ |archivedate=1 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charging up to £11,415 per term in 2014/15, Charterhouse is the 7th most expensive [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference|HMC]] boarding school in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.privateschoolfees.co.uk |title=About us |publisher=Privateschoolfees.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-04-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010123134/http://www.privateschoolfees.co.uk/ |archive-date=10 October 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2016/17 academic year, boarding fees are £39,165 and day boarding is £32,364.

== Controversy ==

=== School fees cartel (2005) ===
{{Main|Independent school fee fixing scandal}}
In November 2005, the school was one of fifty of the country's leading independent schools which were found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing [[cartel]], exposed by ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, although the schools made clear that they had not realised that the change to the law (which had happened only a few months earlier) about the sharing of information had subsequently made it an offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article588559.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Tony | last=Halpin | title=Independent schools face huge fines over cartel to fix fees | date=10 November 2005 | access-date=25 July 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007080058/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article588559.ece | archive-date=7 October 2008 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2006/182-06 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610055129/http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2006/182-06 |date=10 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs Jean Scott, the head of the [[Independent Schools Council]], said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the director-general of the [[Office of Fair Trading]] saying: "They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1455730/Private-schools-send-papers-to-fee-fixing-inquiry.html | title = Private schools send papers to fee-fixing inquiry | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph | location = London | date = 1 March 2004 | accessdate = 15 March 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130625070958/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1455730/Private-schools-send-papers-to-fee-fixing-inquiry.html | archive-date = 25 June 2013 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Richard Pleming (2015) ===

In September 2015, it was reported that the school had seen a "revolt" against Richard Pleming, the headmaster, from pupils and parents who accused him of using "draconian methods".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3246084/Headmaster-Charterhouse-faces-protest-parents.html|title=Headmaster of Charterhouse faces revolt from parents who claim his 'draconian' regime has led to scenes of 'anarchy' at the £12,000-a-term public school|date=23 September 2015|work=The Daily Mail|author=Richard Spillett|access-date=24 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925132538/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3246084/Headmaster-Charterhouse-faces-protest-parents.html|archive-date=25 September 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11883937/Pleming-Out-Revolt-over-draconian-Charterhouse-head.html|title=‘Pleming Out’: Revolt over 'draconian' Charterhouse head|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=23 September 2015|author=Javier Espinoza|access-date=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528062053/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11883937/Pleming-Out-Revolt-over-draconian-Charterhouse-head.html|archive-date=28 May 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016 it was announced that Pleming would step down from his position as Headmaster in January, after three years. The move attracted particular attention given that the unusual decision was taken for Pleming to step down during Long Quarter, and before the end of his contract. The school's Second Master, Andrew Turner, assumed the position of headmaster until the end of the academic year, with Pleming continuing to work at the school fulfilling his teaching duties until the end of the academic year.

=== Proposed development of playing fields (2018) ===
Protests from the local community were triggered by a plan to sell off playing fields in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eagleradio.co.uk/news/local-news/2677974/charterhouse-school-to-sell-off-playing-fields/|title=Charterhouse school to sell off playing fields|date=2018-09-06|work=Eagle Radio|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917034328/https://www.eagleradio.co.uk/news/local-news/2677974/charterhouse-school-to-sell-off-playing-fields/|archive-date=17 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historic sexual abuse ===

Eindhoven ice hockey began in the 1970s with the construction of a hockey arena.  Eindhoven Kemphanen (Kemphanen, "fighting roosters" in English, is a play on words using the name of the "[[Campine|Kempen]]" region) first played in the Eredivisie in 1981-82 and played intermittently in the Eredivisie in the 1980s and 1990s.  The highlight of this period was winning the Netherlands cup competition in 1986.  The team returned to the Eredivisie in 2008-09 for the first time since 1996-97.

'''Football Weekly''' is a [[podcast]] about [[football (soccer)|football]], hosted by ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper in the [[United Kingdom]]. Originally provided weekly (as its name suggests), its popularity led to a mid-weekly spinoff, ''Football Weekly Extra''. ''Football Weekly'' airs on Mondays during the European football season, after the weekend's fixtures, while ''Football Weekly Extra'' airs on Thursdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=James Richardson and his pod-mates return to preview the new Premier League season |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/08/10/football_weekly_39.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=10 August 2007 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Euro 2008]], [[World Cup 2010]], [[Euro 2012]], [[World Cup 2014]] and [[Euro 2016]] tournaments the podcast aired daily.

It was presented by [[James Richardson (television presenter)|James Richardson]], with contributions by various [[The Guardian|Guardian]] journalists and freelance correspondents, most regularly [[Barry Glendenning]]. Despite being an [[England|English]] production, the show takes a notably [[Eurocentric]] view of world [[Association football|football]] matters. Particular emphasis is placed on the [[Premier League]], [[La Liga]], [[Serie A]] and the [[Bundesliga]]. Richardson left his position in July 2017 to become the presenter of rival podcast, ''[[The Totally Football Show]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.football365.com/news/exclusive-james-richardson-to-leave-guardian-football-weekly |title=Exclusive: James Richardson to leave Guardian Football Weekly – Football365 |last=Storey |first=Daniel |date=2017-07-31 |work=Football365 |access-date=2017-08-02 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by [[Max Rushden]].

== Origin and listening figures ==
The podcast began on 11 May 2006 as '''The World Cup Show''', produced daily throughout the [[FIFA World Cup 2006|2006 World Cup]], and returned during the season under its new name on 29 August 2006, due to popular demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epltalk.com/battle-of-the-pods-the-guardian-vs-the-times |title=Battle of the Pods |publisher=Epltalk.com |date=2007-02-01 |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest recorded number of listeners to the pod is 378,000; though the number is often quoted at 150,000 listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/04/10/football_weekly_extra_32.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Football Weekly Extra |date=10 April 2008 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in the wake of the 2018 World Cup, the Guardian's head of sport called the podcast “a brand leader despite plenty of opposition including from the BBC. It is one of our greatest multimedia successes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/15/world-cup-joy-challenge-digital-age-journalistic-challenge|work=The Guardian |location=London |title=The joys and challenges of covering the World Cup in the digital age |date=16 July 2018 |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
In April 2008 Football Weekly was nominated for Sports Programme of the Year in the annual [[Sony Radio Academy Awards]] – the UK's main national radio awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/inside/2008/04/radio_guardian_our_sony_award.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Radio Guardian: our Sony award nominations |first=Matt |last=Wells |date=10 April 2008 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7739">The '''GOAT''' Index ("Greatest of All Time") is a system used in sports to rank the best performers in any given role. The concept/name was created by author and analyst Ben Hinson and first used in a 2016 study Hinson created to rank the best [[NBA]] players from the mid 1970s - early 2000s. In 2017, [[ESPN]] published their first GOAT Index, ranking the best quarterbacks in the [[NFL]] from 1978 to 2017.

== Hinson's GOAT Index ==
Hinson's GOAT Index, first published in December 2016 was designed to rank the best [[NBA]] players based on calculated "GT Scores."&lt;ref name="The G.O.A.T (GT) Basketball Index: Mid 1970s – Early 2000s"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hickamsdictum.com/the-g-o-a-t-who-is-the-best-basketball-player-of-all-time-e43c7e53a9a7|title= The G.O.A.T (GT) Basketball Index: Mid 1970s – Early 2000s |last=Hinson|first=Ben|date=December 18, 2016|work=[[Hickam’s Dictum]]|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hinson's GOAT (GT) Scores account for pacing and rotation minutes as each metric used is assessed on a per 36 minute basis (the only exception being Win Shares, which is assessed on a per 48 minute basis). Unlike Hollinger's [[Player Efficiency Rating]] and Game Scores, GT scores apply equal weight to each metric used, the idea being that no basketball performance metric is more important (or less) than others. By evenly applying defensive, offensive and contribution metrics, no particular player profile is favored. Metrics in the GT index are a combination of general stats like PPG and advanced stats like Win Shares and Usage Rates. Also, the GT Index is not based on a league average, but rather indexes the selected players against themselves, creating an "elite" and holistic way to evaluate performance. As it adjusts for rotation minutes, the GT Index rewards players who make the best use of their time on the court across all facets of the game. The GT Index also factors in effective shooting rates (eFG%), turnovers and personal fouls as weighted metrics, a key difference from Hollinger's PER and Game Scores. Hinson also maintains that traits like a players heart, ability to motivate teammates and other "soft/unmeasurable" traits factor into the Win Share metric.&lt;ref name="G.O.A.T Scoring FAQs"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://hickamsdictum.com/g-o-a-t-scoring-faqs-basketball-3cc519585ee1|title= G.O.A.T Scoring FAQs |last=Hinson|first=Ben|date=June 16, 2017|work=[[Hickam’s Dictum]]|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GOAT Score (GTS) Calculation (Basketball) ==

The formula for Hinson's basketball GT (GOAT) Scores is as follows:

'''Total GTS''',&lt;ref name="The G.O.A.T Basketball Index (All Star Edition vol.1)"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://hickamsdictum.com/the-g-o-a-t-basketball-index-all-star-edition-vol-1-d86c57575da|title= The G.O.A.T Basketball Index (All Star Edition vol.1)|last=Hinson|first=Ben|date=June 25, 2018|work=[[Hickam’s Dictum]]|accessdate=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which represents the full performance rating for an NBA player. This score combines selected regular season and playoff paced metrics and applies weights to reflect the difference in importance between regular season and playoff games:

[[File:GT Score Formula (Total GTS).jpg|1100x600px|alt=Example alt text]]

'''Playoffs GTS''', which focuses on the performance rating for an NBA player over the playoffs (can also be applied to regular season):

[[File:GT Score Formula (Playoffs GTS).jpg|1100x600px|alt=Example alt text]]

Legend:
* PTS/36 = Points per 36 mins
* eFG = Effective Field Goal %
* FT/36 = Free Throw % per 36 mins
* TRB/36 = Total Rebounds % per 36 mins
* AST/36 = Assist % per 36 mins
* STL/36 = Steals % per 36 mins
* BLK/36 = Block % per 36 mins
* TOV/36 = Turnovers per 36 mins
* USG = Usage Rate
* PF/36 = Personal Fouls per 36 mins
* WS/48 = Win Shares per 48 mins

''Note: For Total GTS, 6.05 equates to 0.06045455 rounded to one decimal place.''

''Note: For Total GTS, 3.05 equates to 0.03045455 rounded to one decimal place.''

''Note: For Playoffs GTS, 9.1 equates to 9.090909 rounded to one decimal place.''

''Note: totals in denominators refer to the selected player pool totals/averages, not league''

From Hinson's [https://hickamsdictum.com/the-g-o-a-t-who-is-the-best-basketball-player-of-all-time-e43c7e53a9a7 2016 GOAT Index], Hakeem Olajuwon edged out Michael Jordan by a fraction of a point to be the "GOAT" from the eras used in the study.

== ESPN GOAT Index ==

In July 2017, [[ESPN]] published [http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20096209/nfl-coaches-execs-rank-best-quarterbacks-modern-era-2017 their first GOAT Index] aimed at ranking the top [[Quarterback|NFL quarterbacks]] in modern history. The ESPN GOAT Index like Hinson's earlier study also considered players from the 1970s, and utilized a voting panel consisting of NFL coaches and executives (all Super Bowl winners), each of whom voted on their top ten quarterbacks.&lt;ref name=" The GOAT Index: NFL coaches, execs rank best QBs since 1978"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20096209/nfl-coaches-execs-rank-best-quarterbacks-modern-era-2017|title= The GOAT Index: NFL coaches, execs rank best QBs since 1978|last=Sando|first=Mike|date=July 19, 2017|work=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final quarterback rankings were determined based on how frequently any quarterback outranked his peers across all voting ballots. The ESPN voting panel consisted of Pete Carroll, [[Tony Dungy]], Mike Holmgren, Howard Mudd, Wade Phillips, Mike Reinfeldt, Ray Rhodes, Mike Shanahan, Al Saunders and Norv Turner.

[[Tom Brady]] emerged as the GOAT from the [[ESPN]] survey with 86.7% coverage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6022">The '''World [[Bowling]] Writers (WBW) International Bowling [[Hall of Fame]]''' was established in 1993 and is located in the [[International Bowling Museum]] and Hall of Fame, on the International Bowling Campus in [[Arlington, Texas]].

==History==
The International Bowling Museum and Hall of Fame was located at 11 Stadium Plaza, [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], [[United States of America|USA]], and shared the same building with the [[St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum]], until November 8, 2008.  It moved to Arlington and reopened in early 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bowlingmuseum.com/Home.aspx |title=International Bowling Museum and Hall of Fame homepage. |accessdate=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria for election==
WBW Hall of Famers are chosen strictly in the basis of athletic performance, to even qualify for consideration, a player must be an amateur and accumulate a minimum of 15 points in any combination of four specifically designated international competitions;
*the [[Fédération Internationale des Quilleurs]] (FIQ) adult World Championships
* the [[AMF World Cup|Bowling World Cup]]
* the [[Fédération Internationale des Quilleurs]] (FIQ) adult Zone Masters Championships
* and the [[Olympic Games]]

with gold medals occurring in an event other than five-person team. Five points are credited for a gold medal, three points for silver, and one for bronze.

Each summer, the WBW Administrator scans a database to determine eligible candidates and sends ballots with those players’ names and resumes to current officers of the World Bowling Writers, which formed the Hall’s Board.

==Election process==
There are two categories: “Men” and “Women.” Voters can cast one vote in each category for every three names listed there, and one vote for any group of “leftovers” names in each category that totals less than three. The man and woman who receive the most votes are elected.

In the case of ties, more than one man or one woman can be elected, provided that each candidate in the tie receives at least two-thirds of the total votes cast in that category that year. If that standard is not met, no one is elected in that category that year.

'''Kamp Staaldraad''' ([[Afrikaans]] words, translated idiomatically as ''Camp Barbed Wire'') was a military-style "boot camp" organized as a "[[team building]]" exercise for the [[South Africa]]n national [[rugby union]] team, the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] (or Boks), during their preparation for the [[2003 Rugby Union World Cup|2003 Rugby World Cup]] (RWC). Details of the camp emerged in the South African media, resulting in protest from the upper administrative levels of South African rugby.

Soon after the naming of the Springboks World Cup team in September 2003, Boks coach [[Rudolf Straeuli]] arranged for the team to go to a police camp in the South African bush, near the town of [[Thabazimbi]]. He delegated the responsibility for running the team camp. Several members of staff proclaimed the intention was to banish a sense of individuality from players.

Soon after the Boks were eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Rugby World Cup, a South African newspaper reported that before the RWC, the Boks had been sent to a boot camp where players had allegedly been ordered into a freezing lake naked to pump up rugby balls underwater. The story also alleged that players who tried to get out of the lake, including Boks captain [[Corné Krige]], were forced back in at gunpoint. Within days, several South African newspapers ran pictures leaked from the camp, showing players standing naked in the lake and holding rugby balls in front of their private parts, and shivering Boks players huddled naked in a pit. The [[whistleblower]] emerged as Boks video analyst Dale McDermott.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/News24/Columnists/Keo/0,,2-1630-1634_1578345,00.html How 'Judas' saved the Boks: Columnists: Keo: News24&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days that followed, the media reported other details from the camp:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SPORT/11/16/safrica.rugby.tactics/index.html | work=CNN | title=Springbok rugby secrets laid bare | date=2003-11-15 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The team was ordered to climb into a [[Defensive fighting position|foxhole]] naked and sing the [[National anthem of South Africa|national anthem]] while ice-cold water were being poured over their heads. During their time in the hole, recordings of ''[[God Save the Queen]]'' (used as [[England]]'s national anthem) and the [[New Zealand]] [[All Blacks]] [[Ka Mate haka|haka]] were played at full volume.
*It was confirmed that firearms were present at the camp, although reports varied as to whether they were ever pointed at anyone.
*The players were forced to crawl naked across gravel.
*They also were ordered to spend a night in the bush, during which they were to kill and cook chickens, but not eat them.

Most South Africans condemned Kamp Staaldraad, including the South African military forces; a spokesman for the [[South African National Defence Force]] pointedly told the ''[[Cape Times]]'' newspaper that the force never trained its recruits naked, and he knew of no military organization in the world that did so. Many rugby observers also pointed out that trying to eliminate all individuality from a team could be counterproductive, as there are many times during a rugby match when individual initiative can make the difference between victory and defeat.

Straeuli defended the camp as more details became public, but eventually resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/international/3291925.stm | work=BBC News | title=Straeuli quits Springboks | date=2003-12-04 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-ups in the country's rugby establishment initially refused to distance themselves from Kamp Staaldraad; many of them were purged at the same time as Straeuli. The Boks' disappointing results in 2003 (early exit from the RWC; record losses to [[France national rugby union team|France]], [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]], and [[All Blacks|New Zealand]]; a last-minute win over [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]]) were enough by themselves to threaten the jobs of Straeuli and many rugby executives. However, their attempts to defend Kamp Staaldraad apparently were the last straw for many South African rugby supporters, and for many within the rugby establishment who saw the need for dramatic change.

In a tragic postscript to the story, McDermott was found dead from a bullet wound to the head at his home in [[Durban]] on 9 January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/international/4164237.stm | work=BBC News | title=South Africa video analyst dies | date=2005-01-11 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death was eventually determined to be a [[suicide]]; no foul play had been suspected. McDermott's mother reported that he had suffered extreme [[clinical depression]] in the months leading to his death. After supplying the images that led to the controversy, he was forced to leave his job at the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (from which he had been contracted out to the Boks) and returned to teaching at  [[Durban High School]]. [[Jake White]], who took over as Boks coach after the forced resignation of Straeuli, tried to bring McDermott back into the Boks staff, but [[South African Rugby Union|SA Rugby]] vetoed the re-appointment.

'''Kentucky Horse Park''' is a working horse farm and an educational [[theme park]] opened in 1978 in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. It is located off Kentucky State Highway 1973 (Iron Works Pike) and [[Interstate 75]], at Exit 120, in northern [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]] in the United States. The [[equestrianism|equestrian]] facility is a {{convert|1224|acre|km2|sing=on}} park dedicated to "man's relationship with the horse." Open to the public, the park has a twice daily Horses of the World Show, showcasing both common and rare horses from around the globe. The horses are ridden in authentic costume. Each year the park is host to a number of special events and horse shows.

Additionally, the park contains the International Museum of the Horse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://imh.org/ | title=International Museum of the Horse | accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Smithsonian Affiliate, which has a permanent collection of horse history and memorabilia, along with a rotating historical collection focused on a particular theme. Past themes include A Gift from the Desert (Arabia), Imperial China, and All the Queen's Horses (Britain).

Beginning with the 1979 arrival of [[Forego]], one of the leading handicap horses of the 1970s, the Kentucky Horse Park has been home to some of the world's greatest competition horses, including [[John Henry (horse)|John Henry]], Horse of the Decade for the 1980s and the top money-winning [[Thoroughbred]] gelding in racing history. With the exception of a few months in 1986, John Henry lived at the park from 1985 until his death in 2007, alongside other racing greats such as Forego and his fellow 1970s champion [[Bold Forbes]], and more recent residents [[Cigar (horse)|Cigar]], voted Horse of the Decade for the 1990s, and [[Da Hoss]], the first horse to win [[Breeders' Cup]] races in non-consecutive years.  In late 2008, the champions [[Alysheba]] and [[Funny Cide]] became residents, but Alysheba died at the park in March 2009. 1994 Kentucky Derby winner, Go For Gin, became a resident of the barn in 2011, while Cigar died at the park in 2014.

Besides Thoroughbred horses, [[Standardbred]] pacing greats such as Staying Together and [[Western Dreamer]], [[Cam Fella]] (deceased) and [[Rambling Willie]] (deceased), and Standardbred trotting champion Mr. Muscleman have made the Kentucky Horse Park their home, as well as 5-gaited [[American Saddlebred]] geldings CH Gypsy Supreme, CH Imperator and CH Sky Watch (all deceased).

[[File:Secretariat KY Horse Park.jpg|thumb|Secretariat, winner of the Triple Crown in 1973.]]
A number of horse sculptures stand in the Kentucky Horse Park, including a [[Man o' War]] statue on a pedestal near the entrance, over the horse's grave, which was moved here from Faraway Farm during the establishment of the park in the 1970s. There is also a life-size statue of the 1973 [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|U.S. Triple Crown]] winner [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] with jockey [[Ron Turcotte]] aboard being led by groom [[Eddie Sweat]], sculpted by [[Jim Reno]]. From [[harness racing]], there is a statue of [[Bret Hanover]].

==Kentucky Horse Park's National Horse Center==

The Kentucky Horse Park also contains the National Horse Center, headquarters for more than 30 national, regional and state equine organizations and associations including: 
*[[American Association of Equine Practitioners]]
*[[American Farrier's Association]]
*[[American Hackney Horse Society]]
*[[American Hanoverian Society]]
*[[American Saddlebred Horse Association]]
*[[Carriage Association of America]]
*[[Kentucky Horse Racing Authority]]
*[[Equestrian Events, Inc.]]
*[[United States Hunter/Jumper Association]]
*[[United States Dressage Federation]]
*[[United States Equestrian Federation]]
*[[United States Pony Clubs]], Inc.

For a list of all 30+ organizations in one place, with contacts, see the Kentucky Horse Park website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyhorsepark.com/about-us/national-horse-center|title=National Horse Center - Kentucky Horse Park|website=Kentucky Horse Park}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rolex Stadium==
Rolex Stadium is the primary outdoor event venue in the complex.  The stadium seats {{formatnum:7338}} in its main grandstand but can accommodate up to {{formatnum:37338}} total capacity when bleachers seating up to {{formatnum:30000}} are used, primarily for larger outdoor horse shows, [[concerts]], and other sporting events.  Its show ring measures 306 feet by 406 feet, with the flooring made of sand and fiber; however, [[artificial turf]] has been brought into the stadium for [[soccer]] and [[American football|football]] games on occasion, among other events.  It is the largest outdoor concert venue in Central Kentucky with a capacity of up to nearly {{formatnum:52000}}.  There are six concession stands at the stadium and six restrooms, meaning that concession and restroom facilities may be limited for events that require larger capacity; however Rolex Stadium features an 18-by-33-foot [[Daktronics]] ProStar LED videoscreen.

==Alltech Arena==
[[Alltech Arena]] is Kentucky Horse Park's {{formatnum:5520}}-seat indoor arena, expandable to {{formatnum:8500}} for concerts.  The arena floor and championship ring measures 135 feet by 300 feet; in addition in indoor horse shows, Alltech Arena can also be used for [[indoor American football|indoor football]], [[ice hockey]], [[basketball]], [[circus]]es, [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], concerts, and other special events.  The arena contains nine luxury suites, 222 VIP box seats and a {{formatnum:4000}}-square-foot club lounge seating up to 80 patrons.  The arena floor is below street level; the arena concourse, with {{formatnum:50000}} square feet of space, overlooks the arena floor and contains six concession stands.  There are also two box offices at the arena.

==Events==

The Kentucky Horse Park hosts diverse educational events and competitions. Past examples include:
*The annual [[Rolex Kentucky Three-Day Event]] held at the park since hosting the 1978 World Three-Day Championships
*The annual High Hope Steeplechase since 1974
*The annual Southern Lights holiday festival since 1993
*The National Pony Club Championships every 3 years
*North American Junior and Young Rider Championships, a prestigious event for talented horseback riders ages 14–21, since 2009
*The USEF Pony Finals, the pony hunter/jumper national championships since 2008

Also, in 2015 the park became the new home of the [[Ichthus Music Festival]], a major Christian music festival originally held in nearby [[Wilmore, Kentucky|Wilmore]] until its temporary demise following its 2012 edition.

On December 6, 2005, it was announced that Lexington and the Kentucky Horse Park would host the [[2010 FEI World Equestrian Games]] in September and October. The 2010 games marked the first time the games were held outside of [[Europe]]; additionally, the eight [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-level world championships had never been held together in a single location within Europe.

As part of the games, several improvements to the park were slated:
* The $36 million Alltech Arena was approved in 2006 by the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] (legislature).&lt;ref name="HL_020207"&gt;Jordan, Jim. "$38 million urged for Horse Park." Herald-Leader [Lexington] 2 February 2007. 2 February 2007 [http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/news/local/16603769.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Enhancements to the arena's sound system.
* A resort hotel was planned to be constructed near the park.

On February 1, 2007, Governor [[Ernie Fletcher]] announced that he would seek an additional $38.3 million in improvements to the park in preparation for the games and other major horse events.&lt;ref name="HL_020207"/&gt; In his address to the 2007 General Assembly the governor suggested:
* $24 million for a new outdoor stadium that would feature 10,075 permanent seats but could be expanded to 30,325 temporarily for major events.
* $4 million for an additional {{convert|21000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of exhibition space for vendors.
* $10.3 million for roadway improvements inside the park that would give the facility a second entrance via the campground. A wide loop road would be constructed so that events could be held on both sides of the horse park.

===Funding===

The new indoor stadium and additional exhibition space, costing $28 million, would be financed with 20-year bonds.&lt;ref name="HL_020207"/&gt; The roadway improvements, at $10.3 million within the park would come from the [[Kentucky Transportation Cabinet|state highway fund]]. The resort hotel would be constructed and financed without state funds.

==Administration==

Although the park is owned by the state government, it is administered separately from the [[list of Kentucky state parks|state park system]].

The '''''Miracle at the Met''''' refers to the [[Minnesota Vikings]]' comeback win over the [[Cleveland Browns]] in Week 15 of the [[1980 NFL season|1980 NFL season]]. The Vikings trailed 23–9 in the fourth quarter, but won after Vikings quarterback [[Tommy Kramer]] passed for two touchdowns to wide receiver [[Ahmad Rashād|Ahmad Rashad]] in the last two minutes, including a 46-yard [[Hail Mary pass]] caught with one hand on the last play of the game. The final play is also known as the "Miracle Catch."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title=Notable NFL game-ending Hail Mary plays|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/nfl/la-sp-nfl-hail-mary-chart-20141226-story.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 25, 2014|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vikings won, 28–23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Looking back at past memorable Vikings stadium moments|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/looking-back-at-past-memorable-vikings-stadium-moments-091616|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=September 16, 2016|accessdate=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Game summary ==
The Vikings came into the game with an 8–6 record. The Browns, nicknamed the Kardiac Kids for their many close games, were 10–4. A win for the Browns would clinch them a playoff berth, while a win for the Vikings would clinch them the [[NFC North|NFC Central]] and a playoff appearance. The Browns were favored by 3 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198012140min.htm|title=Cleveland Browns  at  Minnesota Vikings - December 14th, 1980 {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First half ===
The Browns opened up the scoring in the first quarter when their quarterback, eventual league MVP [[Brian Sipe]], threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to [[Calvin Hill]], giving Cleveland a 7–0 lead. In the second quarter, the Browns added to their lead when Sipe ran for a two-yard touchdown, but kicker [[Don Cockroft]] failed to convert the [[extra point]], so the score was 13–0 going into halftime.

=== Early second half ===
In the second half, the Vikings offense came alive, led by [[Tommy Kramer]]. Kramer threw a 31-yard touchdown to Joe Senser at the beginning of the quarter. Vikings kicker [[Rick Danmeier]] then missed an extra point of his own, making the score 13–6 in favor of the Browns. Cockroft and Danmeier both made short field goals for their teams later in the third quarter, and the score grew to 16–9. Early in the fourth quarter, [[Cleo Miller]] ran for a two-yard Browns touchdown, making the score 23–9 with the extra point and seemingly putting the game away.

=== Vikings comeback ===
Kramer led a drive for the Vikings in response that resulted in a second touchdown pass, this time to [[running back]] [[Ted Brown (American football)|Ted Brown]], with 5:01 remaining in the game. Danmeier then missed another extra point, meaning the Vikings still trailed by two scores, 23–15. The Browns received the ensuing kickoff and began trying to run out the clock with repeated handoffs to running back [[Mike Pruitt]]. Then, on second and 8 with 2:18 left, Browns coach [[Sam Rutigliano]] called a surprise pass play, but Sipe's throw was [[Interception|intercepted]] by [[Bobby Bryant]], giving the Vikings a chance to come back.

After the interception, Kramer led the Vikings down the field, completing 4 of 5 passes for 47 yards and a touchdown to [[Ahmad Rashād]]. The drive took only 37 seconds. The Vikings still trailed by 1 point after Danmeier kicked the extra point, and had to kick off with 1:35 left.

After the Vikings failed to recover an [[onside kick]], the Browns regained the ball at the Minnesota 44-yard line. They again tried to run out the clock, but on second down, Browns tackle [[Cody Risien]] was called for [[illegal motion]], negating a five-yard run by Mike Pruitt and backing the Browns up five yards. This would be the difference in the success of the drive, as Pruitt was tackled by [[Scott Studwell]] a yard short of the line to gain on third down. The Browns punted with 23 seconds left, giving the Vikings one last chance.

=== The Miracle ===
After a touchback on the punt, the Vikings got the ball with 14 seconds left and no timeouts on their own 20-yard line. Vikings coach [[Bud Grant]] called a hook and lateral on the drive's first play. Kramer passed to Senser, who immediately lateraled to Ted Brown. Brown ran out of bounds after a 39-yard gain with only five seconds remaining in the game. TheVikingAge called this play the "greatest trick play in Vikings history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thevikingage.com/2016/07/13/nfl-network-forgets-greatest-trick-play-in-vikings-history/|title=NFL Network forgets greatest trick play in Vikings history|date=2016-07-13|website=The Viking Age|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Things still looked bleak for the Vikings; NBC broadcaster [[Len Dawson]] predicted, "they're gonna throw that ball up in the air and hope for a miracle."{{cn|date=January 2018}}

On the game's final snap, Bud Grant called the play "Squadron Right",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in which three wide receivers line up on the right side of the Vikings formation and all run [[go route]]s to the end zone. Kramer dropped back and threw a Hail Mary pass to the right side into a crowd of players. The pass was tipped by  Browns defensive back [[Thom Darden]] at the 5-yard line and then caught one-handed by Rashad at the 1-yard line. Rashad went into the end zone for a game-winning touchdown with no time left. Danmeier's extra point was blocked, so the final score was 28–23.

== Aftermath ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=March 2017}}
Kramer finished with one of the best games of his career, compiling 456 passing yards, 4 touchdowns, and no interceptions. To date, he is the only Vikings quarterback to pass for over 450 yards in a single game. (He topped this total in 1986, passing for 490 yards against the [[Washington Redskins]].)

By winning this game, the Vikings clinched the NFC Central division title and a spot in the [[1980–81 NFL playoffs|playoffs]]. As the #3 seed, they traveled to [[Philadelphia]] to face the [[1980 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]]. Despite holding a 14–7 lead at halftime, the Vikings lost 31–16, and the Eagles went on to win the [[NFC Championship Game|NFC Championship]] and appear in [[Super Bowl XV]].

The Browns overcame their loss and defeated the [[1980 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] in the season's final game to win the AFC Central division, but then lost in devastating fashion to the eventual [[Super Bowl XV|Super Bowl champion]] [[1980 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] in the "[[Red Right 88]]" game.

[[File:Redux R043 fat.jpg|thumb]]
'''Paintball pistols''' are a type of [[paintball marker]] used in [[paintball]], which loosely resemble [[pistol]]s. There are two main types of pistols: [[Paintball marker#Pump action|pump]] and [[Paintball marker#Semi-automatic|semi-automatic]].

== Uses of a pistol and basic use==

===Speedball===
Paintball pistols are not used in tournament level speedball games. Due to one marker per person rules, a player may not carry two markers onto the field. A pistol has a lower shot capacity, leaving the player at a severe disadvantage against an opponent. Sometimes in recreational settings a player will agree to play with a pistol to put themselves at a severe disadvantage to attempt to prove superior skill over an opponent. Playing in such a situation has many similarities to [[stock paintball]].
Despite these apparent disadvantages there are a growing number of players who choose to play with a pistol as their primary marker.

===Scenario===
Paintball pistols are primarily used as a sidearm. The use of a paintball pistol is often as a last resort situation. In scenario games often drivers of [[paintball tank]]s will utilize a paintball pistol as a backup marker.

Some players use them as their primary weapons, such as this player from the paintball team Reaper's Black Hearts from the Woodsball Tournament League.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.woodsballtournament.com/pics/reaper.jpg{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bush===
Paintball pistols are often used as sidearms. Some players have learned diversionary tactics with pistols, pretending to fumble or reload the main marker, only to pull up a close range shot with a pistol. Many players find this kind of action unsportsmanlike, and some fields ban the use of sidearms.

==Manufacturers==
Paintball pistols are manufactured by a number of companies in a few main calibers.  The three main ones are 11&amp;nbsp;mm, 43&amp;nbsp;mm, .68 cal .  The main manufacturers of paintball pistols are Tippmann, Tiberius Arms, and Kingman.  The price points on the pistols range from approximately $100–$400.

== Accessories ==
Many accessories are available for paintball pistols including holsters, mock silencers, scopes, flashlights, laser lights, and high performance part kits.

Another new development from paintball manufacturers is First Strike Rounds.  First strike rounds are designed to replace the .68 caliber paintball and are being introduced into the market.  They can be very useful in paintball pistols where accuracy can be an issue.  The advantage to using first strike rounds is their uniform shape.  Most regular paint balls can easily become malformed causing the paintball to veer off course and resulting in numerous misses.   When you only have a few rounds as is the case with paintball pistols this can end up in your elimination from the game.  First Strike Rounds allow consistency and accuracy even in pistols.

== Pros and Cons ==
As compared to a standard paintball marker:{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Pros ===
*Extremely light
*Can be carried in holster or in a harness
*Smaller profile / no hopper
*More maneuverable / portable
*Can be a [[Ancillary weapon|back-up]] to main "weapon"
*Less exposure while blind firing (a practice banned on most fields)
*Easier reload
*Lesser [[Firearm_malfunction#Mechanical_malfunctions|jam]] frequency
*Quick change of the tank or rubber grips&lt;ref&gt;Paintball Pistol Pros {{cite web| url=http://www.grippaintball.com/best-paintball-guns/| title=Grip Paintball| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219030953/http://www.grippaintball.com/best-paintball-guns/| archivedate=2017-02-19| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cons ===
*Smaller ammunition capacity
*Smaller air capacity (usually 12 gram [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[powerlet]]s to fire 20-50 shots, sometimes 3–4 oz tanks)
*Specialty equipment needed to carry the smaller tubes/magazines and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; powerlets.

'''Rugby union match officials''' are responsible for enforcing the [[rugby union]] laws of the game during a match and imposing sanctions on individuals who do not follow the rules. "Every match is under the control of match officials who consist of the [[referee]] and two touch judges or assistant referees."&lt;ref&gt;''Laws'', page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Further officials can be authorised depending on the level and form of the game.&lt;ref name="Law 6.C"&gt;''Law'' 6.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:WWEstatue 700.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Statue of [[William Webb Ellis]] believed to be the creator of rugby union, outside [[Rugby School]]]]
{{See also|History of rugby union}}
When the game of [[rugby union]] was developed at [[Rugby School|Rugby school]], there were no official rugby referees. It was not until many years later when the game began to spread internationally that an official was included.

Before the creation of rugby referees, the captains from both teams would set the rules down before the [[Rugby union gameplay|game]] began. The two captains would arbitrate the game together as it went on. This is where the ‘advantage’ law comes from in rugby union. This was because a team’s captain was not likely to complain or stop play if his side benefited from the other team’s infringement.

In 1892, the [[International Rugby Board]] was created as a result of a disputed try that the captains could not agree on whether it had been scored. The rugby laws were changed to require one referee and two touch judges at each game to make the arbitration easier and more consistent.&lt;ref&gt;RugbyRugby.com. (2008). ''History of the referee in rugby.'' Retrieved April 5, 2010, from http://guide.rugbyrugby.com/Rugby%20Sections/History/Referee.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then the match official’s job has remained constant. The main change has been in the uniform and since 2000 the use of communication equipment and the television match official has greatly increased.&lt;ref&gt;Heaven's Game. (2009). ''Time to do away with the television match official.'' Retrieved April 5, 2010, from http://bloggers.heavensgame.com/Main/?p=47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==

===Compulsory equipment===
[[File:Metal whistle.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Metal [[whistle]] similar to that used by most referees]]
[[Rugby union]] match officials must use the following equipment:
;Coin
:The referee organises a coin toss with the team captains to decide who kicks off and what end each team takes initially.&lt;ref name="Law 6.A.3"&gt;''Law'' 6.A.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Whistle
:Referees must carry a [[whistle]] to indicate certain occurrences in the game.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.A.7.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Red card
:A red card is used to signal that a player is being sent from the field, or "sent off", for the rest of a match. The referee signals this by holding it aloft in the direction of the player. In International matches, a red card must be used to send a player off unlike [[rugby league]] where a player can simply be pointed to the touchline by the referee.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 10.6(b).&lt;/ref&gt; (Red cards are not required at lower level matches but most referees carry them.)
;Yellow card [[File:Yellow Card.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Referee giving a player a yellow card]]
:A yellow card is used to signal that a player is being temporarily suspended from the game. The player is sent to the "sin bin" for 10 minutes, after which time they are allowed to return to carry on playing. Similarly to the red card, in International matches a yellow card must be used to temporarily suspend a player unlike [[Rugby league]] where the referee, while facing the player being disciplined, will hold out both hands with fingers and thumbs spread to represent 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 10.6(a).&lt;/ref&gt;
;Flag
:The touch judges or assistant referees must each carry a flag, which is used to signal certain things to the referee, players and spectators. The things that a touch judge can indicate with the flag are slightly different from that of an assistant referee. A touch judge must indicate a successful kick at goal (unlike [[Rugby league]] the flag is simply kept down for an unsuccessful kick), when the ball or player holding the ball has gone out of bounds and which team is to throw in. They must also leave the flag up if the wrong team has thrown the ball in, the wrong ball is used at a quick throw, the ball has been touched by any other person than the player throwing the ball at a quick throw and if the foot or part of the foot of the player throwing in is in the field of play.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.B.5(a).&lt;/ref&gt;
;Watch
:The referee is required to have a watch or timekeeping device as the referee is solely responsible for keeping the time.&lt;ref name="Law 6.A.4b"&gt;''Law'' 6.A.4(b).&lt;/ref&gt; In some situations such as professional games time keepers may be appointed and signal the ends of halves but referees are still required to keep the time themselves.&lt;ref name="law_6_a_6"&gt;''Law'' 6.A.6.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Score card
:Referees are required to carry a scorecard as they are solely responsible for keeping the score.&lt;ref name="Law 6.A.4c"&gt;''Law'' 6.A.4(c).&lt;/ref&gt; Once again often this job is given to others but the referee is responsible for the score and must keep it in case there is a complaint about the correctness of the score.&lt;ref name="law_6_a_6"/&gt;

===Other common equipment===
[[Rugby union]] match officials may use the following equipment:
;Uniform
:Many rugby unions require referees to wear a specific uniform to make them easily identifiable and to support the relevant sponsor. These uniforms are usually picked so that they stand out from the teams playing so the ball is not passed to a referee. Uniforms usually consist of a jersey, shorts and socks. In high level games, other officials will also be required to wear a uniform.
;Boots
:Many rugby unions also require their referees to wear rugby boots so they can move quickly and easily around the field. Some unions do permit the use of running shoes as an alternative.
;Microphone and earpiece
:Communication equipment can be used to communicate between officials. This is also often used in televised games to allow viewers to hear what is happening.&lt;ref name="law_6_a_6"/&gt;

==Positions and responsibilities==
[[File:Checking boots.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Referee checking studs]]

===Referee===

====Pre-match====
Before the game, a referee must:
*Check the field to ensure it is safe to play on and meets all regulations. This includes checking the flags, posts, lines and pads.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Check the player's clothing and studs on their boots to ensure they comply with the regulations. A referee may delegate this responsibility to an assistant referee. In some unions, this includes checking mouth guards.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the law which made mouth guards compulsory for rugby union players has led to a 43 percent drop in dental injuries in New Zealand club rugby.&lt;ref&gt;Quarriel, K., Gianotti, S., Chalmers, D., &amp; Hopkins, W. (2005). An evaluation of mouthguard requirements and dental injuries in New Zealand rugby union. ''British Journal of Sports Medicine, 39''(2), 650-651. {{doi|10.1136/bjsm.2004.016022}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Have a discussion with the front row players of both teams to ensure they are aware of how to perform the scrum safely and to outline the referee’s calls in this area.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the inception of this requirement coupled with the Rugby Smart program there has been a dramatic decline in spinal related injuries caused by rugby. In New Zealand alone (the first to try this scheme) there has been a reduction from around four serious spinal injuries per 100 000 players to 0.7 per 100 000 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Quarrie, K., Gianotti, S., Hopkins, W., &amp; Hume, P. (2007). Effect of nationwide injury prevention programme on serious spinal injuries in New Zealand rugby union: Ecological study. ''British Medical Journal, 334''(7604),1150. {{doi|10.1136/bmj.39185.605914.AE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Organise a toss with the two captains. A coin must be used. The team who wins the toss can choose to kick or choose a direction to play for the first half.  If they choose a direction, the other team kicks off.&lt;ref name="Law 6.A.3"/&gt;
*Inform touch judges or assistant referees what their duties are.&lt;ref name="Law 6.B.3"&gt;''Law'' 6.B.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====During the match====
[[File:Australia - Ireland 15-11-2006-3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Refereeing the scrum is an important part of safety in the game]]
The duties of the referee during the game are:
*To be the sole judge of fact and law. The referee must apply fairly all the laws of the game in every match.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.A.4(a).&lt;/ref&gt;
*To keep the time.&lt;ref name="Law 6.A.4b"/&gt;
*To keep the score.&lt;ref name="Law 6.A.4c"/&gt;
*Give permission for players to leave the playing area.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.A.4(d).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Give permission for replacements or substitutes to enter the playing area.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.A.4(e).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Give permission for doctors, medically trained persons or their assistants to enter the playing area, as and when permitted by the law.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.A.4(f).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Give permission for coaches to enter the field at half time.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.A.4(g).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Respond to touch judges or assistant referees signalling with the flag.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.A.5.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ensure safety of players by monitoring blood and injuries as well as ensuring mouth guards are worn and clothing maintains compliant with the regulations.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====After the match====
After the game a referee is required to:
*Communicate score to both teams and to the match organiser. This often includes signing a form with the score on it that is sent to the rugby union in charge of that fixture&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.A.11.&lt;/ref&gt;
*If a player has been sent off or temporarily suspended the referee must give a report to the union in charge of the fixture.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.A.12.&lt;/ref&gt; (Temporary suspension is commonly not reportable at lower level games.)

====Referee's signals====
[[File:Referee penalty.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Referee awarding a penalty]]
The referee having made a decision is required to indicate the decision by blowing the whistle and signalling. 
Primary signals relate to what decision is being awarded. For example, whether a scrum or penalty is awarded. 
Secondary signals relate to why the decision is being awarded. For example, a knock-on (scrum) or a high tackle (penalty).
There are also signals for stoppages in time, replacement and scoring to ensure everyone knows what is happening.&lt;ref&gt;''Laws'' p. 173 - 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Touch judge and assistant referee===
Assistant referees are appointed by the union in charge of the fixture. They are either themselves qualified referees or qualified assistant referees. Assistant referees may be asked to help with duties that touch judges cannot. Touch judges are normally supplied by the teams playing, one from each team.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.B.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pre-match====
*Before the match an assistant referee may be asked to check the studs and clothing of the players. A touch judge is not permitted to do this.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 4.5(a).&lt;/ref&gt;

====During the match====
During the game touch judges and assistant referees must:
*Stand one on each side of the field except for kicks at goal.&lt;ref name="Law 6.B.4a"&gt;''Law'' 6.B.4(a).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Indicate when the ball or player carrying the ball is out and what team can throw it in.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.B.5(c).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Indicate if the ball has re-entered the playing field illegally.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.B.5(d).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Indicate if a kick at goal has been successful. Unsuccessful kicks at goal should not be signalled as they are in Rugby league by waving the flag low towards the ground.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.B.5(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional responsibilities of assistant referees:
*Must report foul play to the referee and give an opinion on the sanction for the incident.&lt;ref name="Law 6.B.4a"/&gt;
*Rule on the scoring of a try if asked.&lt;ref name="Law 6.B.3"/&gt;
*Give referee information on any other aspect of the game if asked and using communication gear.&lt;ref name="Law 6.B.3"/&gt;
*May be asked to keep score and time. Although responsibility is still with the referee to do this.&lt;ref name="Law 6.B.3"/&gt;
*May be asked to control substitutions.&lt;ref name="Law 6.B.3"/&gt;

====After the match====
A touch judge has no responsibilities after a match. The only responsibility an assistant referee has is to complete a written report to send to the referee that is then sent to the union in charge of the game. The report is only required if a player has been sent off or temporarily suspended because of their report on foul play.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.B.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Touch judge and assistant referees signals====
[[File:Touch judge.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Touch judge with flag, who appears to be a reserve of one of the teams.]]
The touch judges and assistant referees cannot stop play, but can signal the referee to enable them to assist him.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.B.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television match official (TMO)===
Often referred to as ''TMO'' or ''[[video referee]]'', a television match official may be appointed to assist the referee in determining whether points have been scored. A television match official can only rule on exactly what the referee asks them (and in most unions they can only be asked about events in-goal or immediately before entering in-goal). Television match officials are commonly used in first class and international televised games.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.A.6(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

In lower level games, where no TMO has been appointed, the referee cannot use video equipment in supporting any decision.  (Local or junior matches are often recorded by coaches or parents, these videos cannot be used by the referee in supporting a decision due to the possibility of bias.  Such videos may though be acceptable as evidence in any post-match discipline hearing.)

===Substitution controller===
At higher levels of rugby, some games have appointed substitution controllers (sometimes called the ''fourth official''). These officials liaise with the teams and ensure they only use their permitted number of substitutions. They also indicate to the referee when a substitute is ready to come on. They often use signs with the number of the player coming off and the player going on the field. This means it is one less thing for the referee to worry about. The substitution controller is also usually the reserve assistant referee. This means that if a referee is injured, one of the assistant referees will take over and the substitution controller will become an assistant referee. If an assistant referee is injured the substitution controller will take the place of the assistant referee.&lt;ref name="Law 6.C"/&gt;

===Timekeeper===
A timekeeper may also be appointed to indicate to the referee when they believe a half should end. Ultimately, it is up to the referee to decide.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.A.6(c)&lt;/ref&gt;

===In-goal judge===
In-goal judges are used in the [[Rugby sevens|seven-a-side]] variation of rugby union to assist the referee in awarding a try and signalling kicks at goal instead of the assistant referees.&lt;ref&gt;''Law'' 6.B.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Referee assaults==

Assaults on rugby referees are being reported more and more in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Mairs. (2009, October 8) Coventry escape punishment over claims of referee assault by fan after Moseley defeat. ''Telegraph'' Retrieved April 5, 2010, from https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/club/6272153/Coventry-escape-punishment-over-claims-of-referee-assault-by-fan-after-Moseley-defeat.html&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that around six percent of United Kingdom referees surveyed had been physically assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;Rainey, D., &amp;  Hardy, L. (1999). Assaults on rugby union referees: A three union survey. Journal of Sport Behaviour, 22(1), 105-113.&lt;/ref&gt; A further examination of the study found that rugby union referees' fear of being assaulted was a significant factor for increased stress.&lt;ref&gt;Rainey, D., &amp; Hardy, L. (1999). Sources of stress, burnout and intention to terminate among rugby union referees.  Journal of Sports Sciences, 17(10), 797 — 806.&lt;/ref&gt; The same study found that rugby referees were most concerned about being assaulted by a spectator or coach. A study by Rainey and Hardy found that it was in fact players who committed assaults on referees the most, contributing to seventy-nine percent of all assaults on referees.&lt;ref&gt;Rainey, D., &amp; Hardy, L. (1999). Assaults on rugby union referees: A three union survey. Journal of Sport Behaviour, 22(1), 105-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reaction to this rugby unions have begun handing out long bans and large fines to individuals who physically assault a referee&lt;ref&gt;Waikato Rugby Union. (2009). ''Waikato Club Player Banned for Life for Punching a Referee.'' Retrieved April 5, 2010 from http://www.mooloo.co.nz/News/Waikato-Club-Player-Banned-for-Life-for-Punching-a-Referee/&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently verbal assault of referees has also received severe punishments.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Hewett. (2010, January 6). Venter faces long ban today for referee outburst. ''The Independent'' Retrieved April 5, 2010 from https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/club-rugby/venter-faces-long-ban-today-for-referee-outburst-1858822.html&lt;/ref&gt; Now the common punishment for a player punching a referee or anything similar is a lifetime ban.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_3010879"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/3010879/Referee-hit-by-baby-holding-spectator |title=Referee hit by baby-holding spectator |author=Fox, Michael |date=October 29, 2009 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws of the game have also been changed to help this by making it compulsory for any official to report any abuse on them or another official to the union in charge of the fixture.&lt;ref&gt;International Rugby Board. (2010). ''Laws of the game: Rugby Union 2010.'' Dublin, Ireland. Law 10.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appointments==
Appointments of officials to games are usually done by the Union in charge of the fixture. The appointment of referees to international games comes from the [[IRB International Referees Panel]]. This ensures that the best officials are adjudicating international matches. Other major competitions such as [[Super Rugby]], [[Heineken Cup]] and age group world cups use a similar system.&lt;ref&gt;International Rugby Board. (2010). ''IRB announces match official appointments.'' Retrieved April 5, 2010, from http://www.irb.com/jwc/news/newsid=2036867.html#irb+announces+match+official+appointments&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Singapore Sports Museum''' was a sports [[museum]] in [[Singapore]], located in the West Entrance of the [[National Stadium, Singapore|National Stadium]].

The Singapore Sports Museum was established in 1983 to preserve and showcase Singapore's sporting heritage. It was opened to the public in May 1983 to coincide with the staging of the 12th [[SEA Games]] in [[Singapore]].

The museum was closed with the official closure of National Stadium on 30 June 2007.

The '''Squash Rackets Federation of India''' or '''SRFI''' is the [[India]]n governmental apex body for the game of [[squash (sport)|squash]]. It conducts the National Squash Championship, and promotes the game through the different state level squash bodies, and provides training facilities and selects the squad for the Indian team.  It also chooses coaches for the national team (presently [[Cyrus Poncha]] and Major S. Maniam). The rise of squash worldwide with many players in the top 100 worldwide and India's higher rankings worldwide are a testament to the hard work put in by the administrators and players over the last decade.

Among the major facilities created by the SRFI is the [[ICL-TNSRA squash academy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://coachcyrus.wordpress.com/2006/10/14/srfi-taking-squash-to-the-masses/ Cyrus Poncha blog]&lt;/ref&gt; which hosted the World Team Championship in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://wmt2007.com/press.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflict between the SRFI and squash athletes came to a fore in 2005, when the government was conferring the [[Dronacharya award]] on SRFI affiliated squash coach Cyrus Poncha. India's number one squash player [[Joshna Chinappa]] wrote a letter to the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs that she never trained under Poncha, and that he had misused her name to get the Dronacharya award.&lt;ref&gt;

|title = SRFI rally behind Poncha

|date = 2005-09-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The SRFI chairman Ramachandran then produced testimonials from Joshna where she acknowledges the support of SRFI and Poncha.

In 2008, the SRFI chose a woman's squad for the Asian championships without [[Dipika Pallikal]], who was then training in Egypt, after having recently won the under-17 British Open.  The federation cited irregularities in the paperwork in informing the group about her absence due to training,&lt;ref&gt;

The SRFI maintains the website indiasquash.com,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiasquash.com/ SRFI website]&lt;/ref&gt; which announces the national squash calendar and other details.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3519">'''Stické''', also called '''stické tennis''', is an indoor [[List of sports#Racket sports|racquet sport]] invented in the late 19th century merging aspects of [[real tennis]], [[racquets (sport)|racquets]] and [[tennis|lawn tennis]].  It derives from {{lang|grc-Latn|[[wiktionary:sphairistikè|sphairistikè]]}} ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] meaning "the art of playing ball"), the term originally given to lawn tennis by [[Walter Clopton Wingfield]].

==Manner of play==
Stické is played with standard lawn tennis [[racquet]]s and low pressure balls in an enclosed court.  The court is somewhat similar to a real tennis court in shape, but is smaller (about 78 feet by 27 feet) and different in construction.  Play takes place using all the basics of lawn tennis and the same scoring system, with the addition of side and back walls.  Players face each other over the net in pairs. 

As in real tennis, there is a ''penthouse,'' used throughout the game as a playing surface and on which the service has to land to start each point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sarah Jones|title=Forget tennis, anyone for Stické?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/wiltshire/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8320000/8320586.stm|publisher=BBC|date=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some courts have a penthouse only down the side, while others have a penthouse at both ends as well. 

==History==
There were over 50 courts built throughout the [[British Empire]] since 1875. The dimensions of the [[Taplow Court]] built by [[William Grenfell, 1st Baron Desborough|Lord Desborough]] in 1892 became the standard. In the early 20th century, stické was a popular recreation at many country houses. At the time it was one of the few games that was played by both men and women.

As of 2005 there are only three playable courts remaining:

* [[Hartham Park]] in [[Corsham]], [[Wiltshire]] ([[England]]). Built in 1904 out of wood.
* [[Knightshayes Court]] in [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]], [[Devon]] (England). Built in 1907 out of wood.
* Viceregal Lodge complex, [[Indian Institute of Advanced Study]], [[Shimla]], [[Himachal Pradesh]] ([[India]]).

Both English courts have active player groups, with an exception of Knightshayes during August to November 2015. During this time, the court was used to present an exhibition on the First World War, as the stické court was used throughout both the world wars as wards for wounded soldiers when the estate was used as a military hospital. The Indian court is primarily used for [[badminton]].

A book about the sport, ''Sticke Tennis'' by Graham Tomkinson, was published in 2004.

A book ''The Rise and Fall of Sticke Tennis 1874-1939'' by Nigel Courtenay à Brassard, was published by Ronaldson Publications in 2017.

'''''The Basketball Diaries''''' is a 1995 American [[coming of age|coming-of-age]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Scott Kalvert]], starring [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Lorraine Bracco]], [[James Madio]], and [[Mark Wahlberg]]. The film is an adaptation of [[Jim Carroll]]'s autobiographical work of [[The Basketball Diaries|the same name]], telling the story of Carroll's teenage years as a promising high school basketball player and writer who developed an addiction to [[heroin]] with his misguided friends.

==Plot==
The film is an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of poet and memoirist [[Jim Carroll]]'s juvenile diaries chronicling his kaleidoscopic free-fall into the harrowing world of drug addiction. The role of Jim is played by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]. As a member of a seemingly unbeatable high school basketball squad, Jim's life centers on his friends and the basketball court; the court becomes a metaphor for the world in his mind. Bobby ([[Michael Imperioli]]), a best friend who is dying of [[leukemia]]; a coach ("Swifty", played by [[Bruno Kirby]]) who makes sexual advances to Jim; and an appetite for [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]] begin to encroach on young Jim's dream of becoming a basketball star. After Bobby succumbs to his illness, Jim tries [[heroin]] for the first time and [[addiction|quickly becomes hooked]].

After Jim is [[suspension (punishment)|suspended from school]] due to playing a basketball game while under the influence of drugs, he drops out. Soon, the dark streets of [[New York City|New York]] become a refuge from Jim's mother's mounting concern for her son. It is revealed that Jim’s mother threw him out of their [[apartment]] for cursing her out over his drug usage. The only escape that Jim has from the reality of the streets is heroin, for which he steals, robs, and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie ([[Ernie Hudson]]), an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim "picked up a game" now and then, he is able to begin the long journey back to sanity. Ultimately, Jim's mother has him arrested when he shows up at her home high and demands money. The journey ends with Jim's incarceration in [[Riker's Island]] for four crimes: [[assault]], [[robbery]], resistance of arrest, and possession of narcotics. After Jim spends months in prison and ceases his drug use, he gets released, changes his life, and performs poetry drawn from his diaries.

==Reception==
The film currently holds a 46% "Rotten" rating at the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/basketball_diaries "The Basketball Diaries"]. ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]''. [[Flixter]]. Retrieved 2011-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Ebert gave two stars out of four, concluding, "At the end, Jim is seen going in through a "stage door," and then we hear him telling the story of his descent and recovery. We can't tell if this is supposed to be genuine testimony or a performance. That's the problem with the whole movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ebert, Roger |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950421/REVIEWS/504210301/1023 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |title=The Basketball Diaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
After the 1997 [[Heath High School shooting]], activist [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] brought this film into a $33 million lawsuit in 1999 claiming that the film's plot (along with two internet [[pornography]] sites, several computer game companies, and makers and distributors of the 1994 film ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'') caused 14-year-old [[Michael Carneal]] to shoot members of a prayer group. The case was dismissed in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/the-needles/792-Legally-Insane-A-History-of-Jack-Thompsons-Antics |title=Legally Insane: A History of Jack Thompson's Antics |date=2007-07-07 |accessdate=August 8, 2009 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |last=Chalk |first=Andy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Media Companies Are Sued in Kentucky Shooting |author=AP |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 13, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film became controversial in the aftermath of the [[Columbine High School massacre]] and the [[Heath High School shooting]], when critics noted similarities between these shooting attacks and a dream sequence in the film in which the protagonist wears a black trenchcoat and shoots six classmates in his school classroom. The film has been specifically named in lawsuits brought by the relatives of murder victims.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Nick (1999-05-06).

'''''The Great American Pastime''''' is a 1956 film. A comedy about [[Little League]] baseball, it stars [[Tom Ewell]].

==Plot==
In a small New York town called Willow Falls, a new manager is needed for the Panthers, a local [[Little League]] baseball team. Bruce Hallerton, a lawyer by trade, volunteers for the job, deciding it would be a way to spend more time with his son, Dennis.

When it turns out Dennis is instead assigned to play for another team, the Tigers, wife Betty assumes that Bruce will quit the coaching job, but he feels a commitment has been made and needs to be kept. Bruce sets about advising his Panther players that trying is more important than winning, but many parents disagree, and Tigers coach Ed Ryder in particular will do anything necessary to win a game.

One parent, widow Doris Patterson, appears to flirt with Bruce in coaxing him to let her son Herbie be his team's pitcher. Another, the wealthy banker George Carruthers, invites the Hallertons over for dinner, only to pitch his own son Foster to the coach.

Particularly inept at first, the Panthers are mocked by everyone, even Bruce's own son. Betty, too, criticizes her husband's inability to make the team improve on the field. She also becomes so jealous at Doris's perceived romantic interest in Bruce that she studies baseball from a manual so she can become the team's official scorekeeper and keep an eye on him at the same time.

Bruce tells the widow he is happily married and discourages her personal interest in him, offending Doris, who had no such interest at all. After a brawl breaks out between the Panthers and Tigers and continued criticism of his methods, Bruce goes to a bar with a buddy, O'Keefe, and gets tipsy. He comes home to find the door bolted by his wife. At the next game, Bruce decides to use O'Keefe's surprisingly fast son, nicknamed "Man Mountain", and he becomes a hero in a Panther victory.

No one congratulates Bruce, so he goes home vowing never to volunteer again, but when all the parents and kids show up later to thank him, Bruce volunteers to become a scoutmaster for the boys.

==Cast==
* [[Tom Ewell]] as Bruce Hallerton
* [[Anne Francis]] as Betty
* [[Ann Miller]] as Doris Patterson
* [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] as Buck Rivers
* [[Judson Pratt]] as Ed Ryder
* [[Raymond Bailey]] as Carruthers

==Reception==
According to MGM records the movie earned $390,000 in the US and Canada and $130,000 elsewhere, making a loss to the studio of $332,000.&lt;ref name="Mannix"/&gt;

The '''University of Charleston Stadium/Laidley Field''' is an 18,500-capacity [[stadium]] located in downtown [[Charleston, West Virginia]], near the state Capitol complex. It features a [[FieldTurf]] playing field for [[American football|football]] and facilities for [[track and field]] competitions.  The turf field is no longer suitable for soccer and lacrosse due to alterations to the track facilities.    

The stadium was finished in 1979, as a complete rebuild of a previous facility. It is owned by [[Kanawha County Schools]].  In 2003, because the school board lacked funds to maintain the stadium, it entered into a joint venture with the private [[University of Charleston]]. UC invested over $1.5 million to replace the turf, add locker rooms and a skybox, and make other improvements in exchange for access and naming rights.  Originally the home field of Capital High School football after the consolidation Stonewall High School and Charleston High School.  Multiple [[middle school]] and community teams also play at the location. It hosts the state high school track and field championships. The field has also played host to multiple high school playoff games as well as being host to the State Championships before their move to [[Wheeling, WV|Wheeling]] in the 90's. It also hosts the [[Gazette-Mail Kanawha County Majorette and Band Festival]] at the end of September of each year. 

Record attendance for this stadium was set at a local high school contest, Charleston High School vs. Stonewall Jackson High School in the latter part of the 1980s, later to be locally called "The Game" of the century. Record attendance was set at over 21,000. Later, when Capital High and Riverside High met when both were undefeated and ranked 1 and 2 in the state, there again were over 20,000 in attendance.

'''Vertical Blue''' is a [[freediving]] competition which has been held annually in [[The Bahamas]] at [[Dean's Blue Hole]] since April 2008 by freediving world record holder [[William Trubridge]].  It is an [[AIDA International]] judged competition  and has been the venue for multiple world and national records for athletes coming from countries all over the world.

On November 17, 2013, American freediver [[Nicholas Mevoli]] died after attempting to set an American record during a Vertical Blue competition at Dean's Blue Hole.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/sports/deep-water-diver-from-brooklyn-dies-after-trying-for-a-record.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&amp;ref=international-home|title=A Deep-Water Diver From Brooklyn Dies After Trying for a Record|journal=[[The New York Times]]|first=Adam|last=Skolnick|date=November 17, 2013|accessdate=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertical Blue is also the name of the freediving school operated by  William Trubridge at Dean's Blue Hole.&lt;ref name="VBschool"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freediving School |url=http://school.verticalblue.net/ |website=Vertical Blue |publisher=Vertical Blue |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4486">'''Win probability''' is a statistical tool which suggests a sports team's chances of winning at any given point in a game, based on the performance of historical teams in the same situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109184250/http://www.fangraphs.com/library/misc/we/ |date=November 9, 2014 |title=FanGraphs: Win Expectancy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The art of estimating win probability involves choosing which pieces of context matter. [[Baseball]] win probability estimates often include whether a team is home or away, inning, number of outs, which bases are occupied, and the score difference. Because baseball proceeds batter by batter, each new batter introduces a discrete state. There are a limited number of possible states, and so baseball win probability tools usually have enough data to make an informed estimate.

[[American football]] win probability estimates often include whether a team is home or away, the down and distance, score difference, time remaining, and field position. American football has many more possible states than baseball with far fewer games, so football estimates have a greater margin of error. The first win probability analysis was done in 1971 by [[Robert E. Machol]] and former [[NFL]] [[quarterback]] [[Virgil Carter]].

As a brief example, guessing that each team playing at home will win is based on [[home advantage]]. This guess uses a single contextual factor and involves a very large number of games. But with only one factor, the accuracy of this guess is limited to home advantage itself (about 55–70% across sports) and does not change within the game based on in-game factors.

[[Win probability added]] is the change in win probability, often how a play or team member affected the probable outcome of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215025201/http://www.advancedfootballanalytics.com/index.php/home/stats/stats-explained/win-probability-and-wpa |date=December 15, 2014 |title=Win Probability and Win Probability Added Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==
Current research work involves measuring the accuracy of win probability estimates, as well as quantifying the uncertainty in individual estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethebook.com/ee/index.php/site/article/misunderstanding_win_expectancy/|last=Tango|first=Tom|date=October 2, 2006|title= Misunderstanding Win Expectancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TangoLichtman2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tango|first1=Tom|authorlink1=Tom Tango|last2=Lichtman|first2=Mitchel|last3=Dolphin|first3=Andrew|title=The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FrUYdXKZFZwC|year=2007|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|isbn=978-1-59797-129-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, if a tool estimates a 24% win probability because 24% of previous teams in that situation won their games, do future teams win at the same 24% rate? Estimating from hidden data uses testing tools like [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]].

While many models involve frequency analysis of past events, other models use Bayesian processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121095618/http://www.footballcommentary.com/dynamicprogramming.htm |date=November 21, 2014 |title=Football Commentary: Description of the Dynamic Programming Model }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some models include a measure of teams' strength coming into the game, while others assume every team is average. Including strength estimates increases the number of possible states, and therefore decreases an estimate's power while possibly increasing its accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411193355/http://www.lookoutlanding.com/2010/2/14/1310724/sabremetrics-101-the-game-state |date=April 11, 2014 |title=Sabermetrics 101: The Game State, Run Expectancy, and Win Expectancy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
