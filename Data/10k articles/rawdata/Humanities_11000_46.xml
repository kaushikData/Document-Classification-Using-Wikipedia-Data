      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15442">The '''2007 tuberculosis scare''' occurred when [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] [[personal injury lawyer|personal-injury lawyer]] '''Andrew "Drew" Speaker''' flew from Atlanta, Georgia to Paris, France and on to Greece and then Italy before returning on a flight from Prague, Czech Republic to Montreal, Canada, where he crossed over the border and back into the United States while infected with [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/05/31/tb.flight/index.html Border security scrutinized after TB patient slips in] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308192527/http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/05/31/tb.flight/index.html |date=2008-03-08 }}, CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Emily Brown and Jeff Bliss, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=ajze0qn17uXM&amp;refer=home "Border Agents Failed to Stop Man With Tuberculosis" (Update4)].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] believed at the time that Speaker was suffering from [[extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis]] (XDR-TB). The incident sparked a debate in [[United States Congress|Congress]] on the failure of [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|federal customs agents]] to stop him.&lt;ref name = Brown /&gt; Upon Speaker's return to the United States, the CDC placed him under involuntary isolation (similar to [[quarantine]]) using a provision of the [[Public Health Service Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/isolationquarantine.htm|title=Fact Sheet on Isolation and Quarantine|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Check the cite - Speaker is NOT under quarantine --&gt; With this action, Speaker became the first individual subjected to a CDC isolation order since 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/other/news/may3107tb.html|title=Odd twist in TB alert: Patient is TB researcher's son-in-law|publisher=CIDRAP|accessdate=2007-06-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070603154608/http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/other/news/may3107tb.html| archivedate= 3 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In January 2007, Speaker suffered a fall and went to the doctor, concerned that he had bruised a rib. Doctors X-rayed his chest and found an abnormality that required further testing.&lt;ref name=NPRTimeline&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/news/specials/tb/ |accessdate=16 April 2016 |title=A Timeline of Andrew Speaker's Infection, June, 2007 |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Speaker was suspected of having TB when a positive [[Mantoux test|PPD test]] came back on March 2, 2007. His third CT scan was done on March 3 and a bronchoscopy was done on March 8. After 18 days of incubation the isolate was sent to CDC for confirmation of his susceptibility results that were done by the Georgia Department of Human Resources (DHR).

On March 28, 2007 his doctors and the health department believed the TB strain Speaker had was a resistant one and communicated this to the CDC. On May 1 the apparent MDR TB infection was discussed with the CDC lab by his doctors and they discussed discontinuing the treatment he was on at that time. On May 9 the suspicion of MDR TB was confirmed. A meeting was held with [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] Health Officials, his doctors, his fiancée and his father and father-in-law on May 10, 2007. At this time he was told that he was not contagious and not a threat to anyone but that he would need to go to Denver for treatment.&lt;ref name=NPRTimeline/&gt; It would take a few weeks to arrange this. He was advised, or according to some accounts strongly recommended, not to travel.&lt;ref name=NPRTimeline/&gt;

==Travel sequence==
On May 12, 2007, Speaker [[transatlantic flight|flew from the U.S.]] to [[Paris]]. On May 14, he flew on to [[Athens]] and, two days later, flew to the [[Aegean Islands|Aegean]] holiday island of [[Santorini]] for his wedding (Santorini's Mayor [[Angelos Roussos]] stated that Speaker lacked the necessary paperwork for the civil ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/06/01/tb.flight/index.html?xid=rss-world |title=CNN story on wedding |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071212013325/http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/06/01/tb.flight/index.html?xid=rss-world |archivedate = 2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Speaker then flew to [[Rome]] for his honeymoon.

Doctors say that only after Speaker left the United States did they realize he likely had [[extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis|XDR-TB]]. Speaker says that he was informed of MDR TB before leaving the country, and that while officials preferred him not to fly, they said that he was not a threat and was not required to wear a mask.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthnewsdigest.com/news/Disease_420/Diagnosed_with_a_Rare_Form_of_Tuberculosis_-.shtml Andrew Speaker Says He's Being Unfairly Attacked] by Eve Conant, Newsweek, 2 Jun 2007.

July 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC informed him that there were no options for the CDC to get him home, and that he would have to arrange private transportation. Speaker instead flew by commercial jet to [[Prague]] and then on to [[Montréal]].&lt;ref name=Park&gt;Park, Alice. [http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1627159,00.html "The TB Scare: A Broken System?"] ''Time''.

[https://www.webcitation.org/5gwsOTpNW?url=http://www.denverpost.com/sportscolumnists/ci_6037621 Archived] 2009-05-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaker has also said that the CDC told him they were going to send officials to put him in Italian quarantine for up to two years, and that he was not told special transportation was arranged.&lt;ref name = McPhee /&gt;

Once in Montréal, Speaker rented a car and drove across the [[Canada–United States border]]. A Customs and Border Protection Officer failed to detain him at the frontier, disregarding a warning after he had passed Speaker's passport through the [[Treasury Enforcement Communications System]] (TECS)&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; to hold the traveler, wear a protective mask when dealing with him, and call health authorities because he "did not look sick".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.9news.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=71772 | publisher=Fox News | accessdate=2007-06-11 | title= Border agent fired after allowing TB patient into country}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flight itinerary==
According to the CDC, Speaker flew on the following flights:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tb/xdrtb/caseflighthistory.htm |title=Flight Itinerary of U.S. Traveler with Extensively Drug–Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR TB) (May 30, 2007) |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2008-11-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081012223701/http://www.cdc.gov/tb/xdrtb/caseflighthistory.htm| archivedate= 12 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tuberculosis case notes==
{{wikinewspar2|US tuberculosis patient moved to Denver hospital|US places man with TB under quarantine, launches search for contactees}}
On May 31, 2007, Speaker was moved from [[Grady Memorial Hospital]] in [[Atlanta]] to the [[National Jewish Medical and Research Center]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]], for further treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,276613,00.html |title=Foxnews.com: TB Patient moved to Denver hospital, May 31, 2007 |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=May 31, 2007 |accessdate=2008-11-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002135315/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C276613%2C00.html |archivedate=2 October 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that Speaker's father-in-law, Robert C. Cooksey, works for the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and is a [[Microbiology|microbiologist]] who has conducted research on [[tuberculosis]], according to his CDC biography posted on the agency's Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/05/31/tb.flight/index.html |title=CNN web site: TB patient's name released; father-in-law works at CDC |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080308192527/http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/05/31/tb.flight/index.html |archivedate = 2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wearing a medical mask, Speaker was interviewed by [[Diane Sawyer]] on the June 1 edition of the American talk show ''[[Good Morning America]]'' on ABC and apologized to all passengers, explaining that he had not intended to endanger them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=3231184&amp;page=1 |title=ABCNews.com: TB Patient: "I Really Believed I Wasn't Putting People at Risk" June 1, 2007 |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080929161834/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=3231184&amp;page=1| archivedate= 29 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an interview on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', Speaker said that he had not been told that there was any risk of transmitting the disease to others, nor did the May 10 letter recommending against his travel state this, which Speaker in any case had not received before leaving May 14. His wife, with whom he lived for five months without precautions, remained uninfected.

==New diagnosis==
On July 4, 2007 the National Jewish Medical and Research Center announced, and the CDC confirmed, that Mr. Speaker's earlier diagnosis was incorrect and that he instead had [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]] (MDR-TB), a more treatable form of tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/07/03/tb.speaker/index.html | publisher=CNN | accessdate=2007-07-04 | title=Doctors: TB traveler's diagnosis more treatable than thought | date=2007-07-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070712192138/http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/07/03/tb.speaker/index.html#cnnSTCVideo| archivedate= 12 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isolation and law==
Before a Congressional hearing, Speaker and his father played audio recordings from CDC and Fulton County health officials which say he was not a danger to others. He asked such questions on five recordings repeatedly and was given the same answers even after stating on two recordings that he was going out of the country and the CDC later admitted they were aware and waited until he had already left before taking further actions.

Speaker was in New York when the CDC served him with an isolation order but CDC director Julie Gerberding stated that the government was legally constrained prior to that order. The federal statute granting quarantine authority allows isolation or quarantine but only for individuals coming into the country from a foreign country or territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1181207137498 | publisher=Law.com | accessdate=2007-06-08 | title=The Legal Questions Behind the TB Case}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia TB law may have required Speaker to be confined for two weeks and only allowed travel for medical appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.physorg.com/news103981421.html | publisher=Physorg.com | accessdate=2007-07-18 | title=TB patient travel may have been illegal| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070826171751/http://www.physorg.com/news103981421.html| archivedate= 26 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A court confinement order can isolate a patient only after the infected patient ignores medical advice. This method can be overridden by a declaration of public health emergency by the governor of Georgia.

In 2007, seven Canadians and two Czechs sued Speaker in Montreal [[Quebec Superior Court|Superior Court]]; eight of the plaintiffs were on the same flight as Andrew Speaker and one was related to one of the passengers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/07/12/tb.suit/ Plane passengers sue TB patient], CNN (July 13, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1855_Damascus_map_byPorter.png|thumb|Map of Damascus in 1855]]
The '''Ancient City of Damascus''' is the historic city centre of [[Damascus]], [[Syria]]. The old city which is one of the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously inhabited cities]] in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite concrete|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains numerous archaeological sites, including some historical churches and mosques. Many cultures have left their mark, especially Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine and Islamic. In 1979, the historical center of the city, surrounded by walls of [[Roman Syria|Roman]] era, was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]. In June 2013, UNESCO included all Syrian sites on the list of [[World Heritage in Danger]] to warn of the risks to which they are exposed because of the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/20  |title=Ancient City of Damascus |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and founding==
Lying on the south bank of [[Barada River]], the ancient city was founded in the 3rd millennium B.C. The horizontal diameter of the oval is about 1.5&amp;nbsp;km (0.9&amp;nbsp;mi) which is known as [[Damascus Straight Street]], while the vertical diameter ({{lang-la|Cardus Maximus}}) is about 1&amp;nbsp;km (0.6&amp;nbsp;mi). With an approximate area of 86.12 hectares (212.8 acres; 0.86 km2), the ancient city was enclosed within a historic wall of 4.5&amp;nbsp;km (2.8&amp;nbsp;mi) in circuit that was mainly built by the Romans, then fortified by the [[Ayyubids]] and [[Mamluks]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt;

The first mentioning of Damascus was as "Ta-ms-qu" in the second millennium BC, it was situated in an [[Amorite]] region in the middle of a conflict zone between the [[Hittites]] and [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egyptians]]. The city exercised tributary until the emergence of the [[Sea Peoples]] in 1200 BC whose raids helped in weakening the arch rivals. Consequently, the Semitic [[Arameans]] managed to establish the independent state of [[Aram-Damascus]] (11th century – 733 BC), naming the main city as ‘Dimashqu’ or ‘Darmeseq’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ross Burns|title=Damascus: A History|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|pages=4–8|isbn=0-203-93995-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main sights==
[[File:Damasco via rectaHPIM3222.JPG|thumb|left|Typical ancient Damascene street]]
Damascus has a wealth of historical sites dating back to many different periods of the city's history. Since the city has been built up with every passing occupation, it has become almost impossible to excavate all the ruins of Damascus that lie up to {{convert|8|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} below the modern level. The [[Citadel of Damascus]] is located in the northwest corner of the Old City. The ''[[Damascus Straight Street]]'' (referred to in the [[Conversion of Saint Paul|conversion]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 9:11), also known as the ''[[Via Recta]]'', was the [[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]] (east–west main street) of Roman Damascus, and extended for over {{convert|1500|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}}. Today, it consists of the street of Bab Sharqi and the Souk Medhat Pasha, a covered market. The [[Bab Sharqi]] street is filled with small shops and leads to the old Christian quarter of [[Bab Tuma]] (St. Thomas's Gate). [[Medhat Pasha Souq]] is also a main market in Damascus and was named after [[Midhat Pasha]], the Ottoman governor of Syria who renovated the Souk. At the end of the Bab Sharqi street, one reaches the [[House of Saint Ananias|House of Ananias]], an underground chapel that was the cellar of [[Ananias of Damascus|Ananias]]'s house. The [[Umayyad Mosque]], also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus, is one of the largest mosques in the world and also one of the oldest sites of continuous prayer since the rise of Islam. A shrine in the mosque is said to contain the body of [[St. John the Baptist]]. The [[Mausoleum of Saladin|mausoleum]] where [[Saladin]] was buried is located in the gardens just outside the mosque. [[Sayyidah Ruqayya Mosque]], the shrine of the youngest daughter of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], can also be found near the Umayyad Mosque. The ancient district of [[Amara District|Amara]] is also within a walking distance from these sites. Another heavily visited site is [[Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque]], where the tomb of [[Zaynab bint Ali]] is located.

===Hammams===
The presence of public baths ([[Turkish bath|ḥammāms]]) in Damascus started during the [[Umayyad]] era, while some historians date them back to the [[Roman Syria|Roman]] era. The Damascene baths were mentioned by a number of Damascus historians, such as [[Ibn 'Asakir]] (1106–1175 AD) in his famous book "The History of Damascus". In his book, Ibn 'Asakir named 77 of baths working at that time within the city. The historian [[Izz al-Din ibn Shaddad|Ibn Shaddad]] counted 114 baths located in Damascus in 1250 AD.

The number of these baths increased to 365 during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era, then decreased drastically to reached 60 baths in the late nineteenth century AD. Today, however, the number of baths in full operation is barely 20, the most famous of them is the "Nour al-Din al-Shahid" bath in the [[Al-Buzuriyah Souq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/sami-moubayed/hammams-of-old-damascus-b_b_10413190.html|title=Hammams of Old Damascus: Back from the Dead|work=Huffington Post|date=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation of the ancient city==
===Threats to the future of the old City===
[[File:Damascusalley.JPG|upright|thumb|Narrow alley in old Damascus]]
Due to the rapid decline of the population of Old Damascus (between 1995 and 2009 about 30,000 people moved out of the old city for more modern accommodation),&lt;ref name="Hendawi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hendawi|first1=Hamza|title=Old Damascus struggles to cope in the new Syria|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-ml-syria-saving-old-city-020109-2009feb01-story.html|accessdate=13 August 2017|agency=The Associated Press|publisher=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; a growing number of buildings are being abandoned or are falling into disrepair. In March 2007, the local government announced that it would be demolishing Old City buildings along a {{convert|1400|m|ft|abbr=on}} stretch of rampart walls as part of a redevelopment scheme. These factors resulted in the Old City being placed by the [[World Monuments Fund]] on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world.&lt;ref name=press_release&gt;{{cite web|author1=World Monuments Fund |title=2008 World Monuments Watch List Of 100 Most Endangered Sites |url=http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_publication/Watch_2008_site_descriptions_0.pdf |website=World Monuments Fund |publisher=World Monuments Fund |accessdate=27 July 2015 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320161546/http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_publication/Watch_2008_site_descriptions_0.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Panelists Bios |publisher=World Monuments Fund |url=http://www.wmf.org/pdf/Watch_2008_panel.pdf |accessdate=3 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513042550/http://wmf.org/pdf/Watch_2008_panel.pdf |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped that its inclusion on the list will draw more public awareness to these significant threats to the future of the historic Old City of Damascus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4280">[[File:Apachenträne.jpg|thumb|an Apache tear]]'''"Apache tears"''' is the popular term for rounded [[pebble]]s of [[obsidian]] or "obsidianites" composed of black or dark-colored natural volcanic glass, usually of rhyolite composition and bearing conchoidal fracture.  Also known by the lithologic term "marekanite", this variety of obsidian occurs as subrounded to subangular bodies up to about 2 inches in diameter, often bearing indented surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;American Geological Institute, Gary, Margaret, McAfee, Robert, Jr., Wolf, Carol L., eds., 1972, Glossary of geology: Washington, D.C&lt;/ref&gt;  Internally the pebbles sometimes contain fine bands or microlites and though in reflected light they appear black and opaque, they may be translucent in transmitted light.  Apache tears fall between 5 and 5.5 in hardness on the [[Mohs scale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gemtradenet.com/Education/apachetears.aspx Apache Tears Obsidian Education and Information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603160904/http://www.gemtradenet.com/Education/apachetears.aspx |date=June 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology ==
Apache tears originate from siliceous lava flows, lava domes or ash-flow tuffs, often in close association with or embedded in, gray [[perlite]].  The spherules occur as cores within perlite masses that typically exhibit texture of concentrically curved, onion-skin fractures.  Formation is apparently related to differential cooling and various alkali and water contents.  Excessive water present during cooling and quenching of rhyolitic lava causes obsidian to hydrate (i.e., water entering the obsidian glass converts it to perlite).  Where perlite is incompletely hydrated, fresh obsidian cores remain as pebbles of marekanite or Apache tears; this origin has been occasionally described in the geologic literature (for example,&lt;ref&gt;Mrazova, Stepanka &amp; Gadas, Petr, 2011, Obsidian balls (marekanite) from Cerro Tijerina, central Nicaragua: petrographic investigations: Jour. Geosci., v. 56, p. 43-49&lt;/ref&gt;).

Apache tears are well known from Tertiary volcanic terrain in numerous localities throughout the western United States, particularly Arizona, from where specimens were widely collected and sold in the [[lapidary]] and specimen trade.&lt;ref&gt;Sinkankas, John, 1959, Gemstones of North America: Van Nostrand; p. 503-508&lt;/ref&gt;  Several districts in western Nevada also have yielded abundant Apache tears eroding from tuff beds; such areas have been popularized in the lapidary trade through guides for rockhounds.&lt;ref&gt;Kappele, William A., 1998, Rockhounding Nevada: A guide to the state’s best rockhounding sites: Falcon Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Specimens from many of these sites have been avidly collected by rockhounds and lapidary enthusiasts, are often tumbled and may be considered [[Gemstone|semi-precious gemstones]]; locations are noted in the section "Gemstones of Nevada" by Rose &amp; Ferdock.&lt;ref&gt;Castor, Stephen B. &amp; Ferdock, Gregory C., 2004, Minerals of Nevada: Univ. of Nevada Press, NV Bur. Mines &amp; Geol. Special Publication 31, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
The name "Apache tear" comes from a legend of the [[Apache]] tribe: about 75 Apaches and the US Cavalry fought on a mountain overlooking what is now [[Superior, Arizona]] in the 1870s. Facing defeat, the outnumbered Apache warriors rode their horses off the mountain to their deaths rather than be killed. The wives and families of the warriors cried when they heard of the tragedy; their tears turned into stone upon hitting the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ideal.azed.gov/p/system/files/GR8_ApacheTears.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209140634/https://www.ideal.azed.gov/p/system/files/GR8_ApacheTears.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=legend1&gt;[http://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Legends/Apache_Tear_Drop-Apache.html Native American Legends]&lt;/ref&gt;

American singer songwriter [[Johnny Cash]] wrote a song entitled "Apache Tears" for his 1964 album ''[[Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian]]''.

'''Augustus De Morgan''' (27 June 1806 – 18 March 1871) was a British mathematician and [[logician]]. He formulated [[De Morgan's laws]] and introduced the term [[mathematical induction]], making its idea rigorous.&lt;ref&gt;De Morgan, (1838) ''Induction (mathematics)'', ''[[The Penny Cyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Childhood===
Augustus De Morgan was born in [[Madurai]], India in 1806.{{efn|The year of his birth may be found by solving a conundrum proposed by himself, "I was {{mvar|x}} years of age in the year {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (He was 43 in 1849). The problem is indeterminate, but it is made strictly determinate by the century of its utterance and the limit to a man's life. Those born in 1722 (1764–42), 1892 (1936–44) and 1980 (2025–45) are similarly privileged.}} His father was Lieut.-Colonel John De Morgan (1772–1816), who held various appointments in the service of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]]. His mother, Elizabeth Dodson (1776–1856), was a descendant of [[James Dodson (mathematician)|James Dodson]], who computed a table of anti-logarithms, that is, the numbers corresponding to exact [[logarithm]]s. Augustus De Morgan became blind in one eye a month or two after he was born. The family moved to England when Augustus was seven months old. As his father and grandfather had both been born in India, De Morgan used to say that he was neither English, nor Scottish, nor Irish, but a Briton "unattached", using the technical term applied to an undergraduate of [[Oxford]] or [[Cambridge]] who is not a member of any one of the Colleges.

When De Morgan was ten years old his father died. Mrs De Morgan resided at various places in the southwest of England, and her son received his elementary education at various schools of no great account. His mathematical talents went unnoticed until he was fourteen, when a family-friend discovered him making an elaborate drawing of a figure in [[Euclid]] with [[ruler and compasses]]. She explained the aim of Euclid to Augustus, and gave him an initiation into demonstration.

He received his secondary education from Mr Parsons, a fellow of [[Oriel College, Oxford]], who appreciated classics better than mathematics. His mother was an active and ardent member of the [[Church of England]], and desired that her son should become a clergyman, but by this time De Morgan had begun to show his [[Nonconformism|non-conforming]] disposition. He became an atheist.{{sfn |Beloff|1997|p=47}}{{sfn|De Morgan|De Morgan|1882|p=393}}

===University education===
In 1823, at the age of sixteen, he entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=D823A|name=De Morgan, Augustus}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he came under the influence of [[George Peacock]] and [[William Whewell]], who became his lifelong friends; from the former he derived an interest in the renovation of algebra, and from the latter an interest in the renovation of logic—the two subjects of his future life work. His college tutor was [[John Philips Higman]], FRS (1793–1855).

At college he played the [[flute]] for recreation and was prominent in the musical clubs. His love of knowledge for its own sake interfered with training for the great mathematical race; as a consequence he came out fourth [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]]. This entitled him to the degree of Bachelor of Arts; but to take the higher degree of [[Master of Arts]] and thereby become eligible for a fellowship it was then necessary to pass a theological test. To the signing of any such test De Morgan felt a strong objection, although he had been brought up in the Church of England. In about 1875 theological tests for academic degrees were abolished in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.

===London University===
As no career was open to him at his own university, he decided to go to the Bar, and took up residence in London; but he much preferred teaching mathematics to reading law. About this time the movement for founding London University (now [[University College London]]) took shape. The two ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge were so guarded by theological tests that no Jew or Dissenter outside the Church of England could enter as a student, still less be appointed to any office. A body of liberal-minded men resolved to meet the difficulty by establishing in London a University on the principle of religious neutrality. De Morgan, then 22 years of age, was appointed professor of mathematics. His introductory lecture "On the study of mathematics" is a discourse upon mental education of permanent value, and has been recently reprinted in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The London University was a new institution, and the relations of the Council of management, the Senate of professors and the body of students were not well defined. A dispute arose between the professor of anatomy and his students, and in consequence of the action taken by the Council, several professors resigned, headed by De Morgan. Another professor of mathematics was appointed, who then drowned a few years later. De Morgan had shown himself a prince of teachers: he was invited to return to his chair, which thereafter became the continuous centre of his labours for thirty years.

The same body of reformers—headed by [[Henry Peter Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Lord Brougham]], a Scotsman eminent both in science and politics who had instituted the London University—founded about the same time a [[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]]. Its object was to spread scientific and other knowledge by means of cheap and clearly written treatises by the best writers of the time. One of its most voluminous and effective writers was De Morgan. He wrote a great work on ''The Differential and Integral Calculus'' which was published by the Society; and he wrote one-sixth of the articles in the ''[[Penny Cyclopedia]]'', published by the Society, and issued in penny numbers. When De Morgan came to reside in London he found a congenial friend in [[William Frend (social reformer)|William Frend]], notwithstanding his mathematical heresy about negative quantities. Both were arithmeticians and actuaries, and their religious views were somewhat similar. Frend lived in what was then a suburb of London, in a country-house formerly occupied by [[Daniel Defoe]] and [[Isaac Watts]]. De Morgan with his flute was a welcome visitor.

The London University of which De Morgan was a professor was a different institution from the [[University of London]]. The University of London was founded about ten years later by the Government for the purpose of granting degrees after examination, without any qualification as to residence. The London University was affiliated as a teaching college with the University of London, and its name was changed to University College. The University of London was not a success as an examining body; a teaching University was demanded. De Morgan was a highly successful teacher of mathematics. It was his plan to lecture for an hour, and at the close of each lecture to give out a number of problems and examples illustrative of the subject lectured on; his students were required to sit down to them and bring him the results, which he looked over and returned revised before the next lecture. In De Morgan's opinion, a thorough comprehension and mental assimilation of great principles far outweighed in importance any merely analytical dexterity in the application of half-understood principles to particular cases.

During this period, he also promoted the work of the self-taught Indian mathematician [[Ramchundra]], who has been called De Morgan's [[S. Ramanujan|Ramanujan]]. He supervised the publication in London of Ramchundra's book ''Treatise on Problems of Maxima and Minima'' in 1859. In the introduction to this book, he acknowledged being aware of the Indian tradition of logic, although it is not known whether this had any influence on his own work.

===Family===
Augustus was one of seven children, four of whom survived to adulthood.
* Eliza (1801–1836) married Lewis Hensley, a surgeon, living in Bath.
* Augustus (1806–1871)
* George (1808–1890), a barrister-at-law who married Josephine, daughter of Vice Admiral Josiah Coghill, 3rd Baronet Coghill
* [[Campbell De Morgan|Campbell Greig]] (1811–1876), a surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital

In the autumn of 1837, he married [[Sophia Elizabeth Frend]] (1809–1892), eldest daughter of [[William Frend (social reformer)|William Frend]] (1757–1841) and Sarah Blackburne (1779–?), a granddaughter of [[Francis Blackburne (priest)|Francis Blackburne]] (1705–1787), Archdeacon of Cleveland.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Frend, William|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Morgan had three sons and four daughters, including fairytale author [[Mary de Morgan]]. His eldest son was the potter [[William De Morgan]]. His second son [[George de Morgan|George]] acquired distinction in mathematics at University College and the University of London. He and another like-minded alumnus conceived the idea of founding a mathematical society in London, where mathematical papers would be not only received (as by the [[Royal Society]]) but actually read and discussed. The first meeting was held in University College; De Morgan was the first president, his son the first secretary. It was the beginning of the [[London Mathematical Society]].

===Retirement and death===
[[File:Augustus De Morgan.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustus De Morgan.]]
In 1866 the chair of mental philosophy in University College fell vacant. [[James Martineau]], a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] clergyman and professor of mental philosophy, was recommended formally by the Senate to the Council; but in the Council there were some who objected to a Unitarian clergyman, and others who objected to theistic philosophy. A layman of the school of [[Alexander Bain|Bain]] and [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]] was appointed. De Morgan considered that the old standard of religious neutrality had been hauled down, and forthwith resigned. He was now 60 years of age. His pupils secured him a pension of £500 p.a., but misfortunes followed. Two years later his son George—the "younger Bernoulli", as Augustus loved to hear him called, in allusion to the eminent father-and-son mathematicians of that name—died. This blow was followed by the death of a daughter. Five years after his resignation from University College De Morgan died of [[nervous prostration]] on 18 March 1871.

==Mathematical work==
De Morgan was a brilliant and witty writer, whether as a controversialist or as a correspondent. In his time there flourished two Sir William Hamiltons who have often been conflated. One was [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet]] (that is, his title was inherited), a Scotsman, professor of logic and metaphysics at the [[University of Edinburgh]]; the other was a knight (that is, won the title), an Irishman, professor at astronomy in the University of Dublin. The baronet contributed to logic, especially the doctrine of the quantification of the predicate; the knight, whose full name was [[William Rowan Hamilton]], contributed to mathematics, especially [[geometric algebra]], and first described the [[Quaternion]]s. De Morgan was interested in the work of both, and corresponded with both; but the correspondence with the Scotsman ended in a public controversy, whereas that with the Irishman was marked by friendship and terminated only by death. In one of his letters to Rowan, De Morgan says,
:Be it known unto you that I have discovered that you and the other Sir W. H. are reciprocal polars with respect to me (intellectually and morally, for the Scottish baronet is a polar bear, and you, I was going to say, are a polar gentleman). When I send a bit of investigation to Edinburgh, the W. H. of that ilk says I took it from him. When I send you one, you take it from me, generalize it at a glance, bestow it thus generalized upon society at large, and make me the second discoverer of a known theorem.

The correspondence of De Morgan with Hamilton the mathematician extended over twenty-four years; it contains discussions not only of mathematical matters, but also of subjects of general interest. It is marked by geniality on the part of Hamilton and by wit on the part of De Morgan. The following is a specimen:
Hamilton wrote,
:My copy of Berkeley's work is not mine; like Berkeley, you know, I am an Irishman.
De Morgan replied,
:Your phrase 'my copy is not mine' is not a bull. It is perfectly good English to use the same word in two different senses in one sentence, particularly when there is usage. Incongruity of language is no bull, for it expresses meaning. But incongruity of ideas (as in the case of the Irishman who was pulling up the rope, and finding it did not finish, cried out that somebody had cut off the other end of it) is the genuine bull.

De Morgan was full of personal peculiarities. On the occasion of the installation of his friend, Lord Brougham, as Rector of the University of Edinburgh, the Senate offered to confer on him the honorary degree of LL. D.; he declined the honour as a misnomer. He once printed his name: Augustus De Morgan, ''H – O – M – O – P – A – U – C – A – R – U – M – L – I – T – E – R – A – R – U – M'' (Latin for "man of few letters").{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

He disliked the provinces outside London, and while his family enjoyed the seaside, and men of science were having a good time at a meeting of the [[British Association]] in the country, he remained in the hot and dusty libraries of the metropolis. He said that he felt like [[Socrates]], who declared that the farther he was from [[Athens]] the farther was he from happiness. He never sought to become a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]], and he never attended a meeting of the Society; he said that he had no ideas or sympathies in common with the physical philosopher. His attitude was possibly due to his physical infirmity, which prevented him from being either an observer or an experimenter. He never voted at an election, and he never visited the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], the [[Tower of London]] or [[Westminster Abbey]].

Were the writings of De Morgan, such as his contributions to the Useful Knowledge Society, published in the form of collected works, they would form a small library Mainly through the efforts of Peacock and Whewell, a Philosophical Society had been inaugurated at Cambridge, and De Morgan contributed four memoirs to its transactions on the foundations of algebra, and an equal number on formal logic. The best presentation of his view of algebra is found in a volume, entitled ''Trigonometry and Double Algebra'', published in 1849; and his earlier view of formal logic is found in a volume published in 1847. His most distinctive work is styled ''[[A Budget of Paradoxes]]''; it originally appeared as letters in the columns of the ''Athenæum'' journal; it was revised and extended by De Morgan in the last years of his life, and was published posthumously by his widow.

George Peacock's theory of algebra was much improved by [[D. F. Gregory]], a younger member of the Cambridge School, who laid stress not on the permanence of equivalent forms, but on the permanence of certain formal laws. This new theory of algebra as the science of symbols and of their laws of combination was carried to its logical issue by De Morgan; and his doctrine on the subject is still followed by English algebraists in general. Thus [[George Chrystal]] founds his ''Textbook of Algebra'' on De Morgan's theory; although an attentive reader may remark that he practically abandons it when he takes up the subject of infinite series. De Morgan's theory is stated in his volume on ''Trigonometry and Double Algebra'', where in Book II, Chapter II, headed "On symbolic algebra", he writes:

:In abandoning the meanings of symbols, we also abandon those of the words which describe them. Thus ''&gt;addition'' is to be, for the present, a sound void of sense. It is a mode of combination represented by &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;; when &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; receives its meaning, so also will the word ''addition''. It is most important that the student should bear in mind that, ''with one exception'', no word nor sign of arithmetic or algebra has one atom of meaning throughout this chapter, the object of which is ''symbols, and their laws of combination,'' giving a ''symbolic algebra'' which may hereafter become the grammar of a hundred distinct ''significant algebras''. If any one were to assert that &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt; might mean reward and punishment, and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, etc. might stand for virtues and vices, the reader might believe him, or contradict him, as he pleases—but not out of ''this'' chapter.

:The one exception above noted, which has some share of meaning, is the sign &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; placed between two symbols, as in &lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt;. It indicates that the two symbols have the same resulting meaning, by whatever different steps attained. That &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, if quantities, are the same amount of quantity; that if operations, they are of the same effect, etc.

===''Trigonometry and Double Algebra''===
De Morgan's work entitled ''Trigonometry and Double Algebra''{{sfn|De Morgan|1849}} consists of two parts; the former of which is a treatise on [[trigonometry]], and the latter a treatise on generalized algebra which he called "double algebra". The first stage in the development of algebra is ''arithmetic'', where only natural numbers and symbols of operations such as {{math|+}}, {{math|×}}, etc. are used. The next stage is ''universal arithmetic'', where letters appear instead of numbers, so as to denote numbers universally, and the processes are conducted without knowing the values of the symbols. Let {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} denote any natural numbers. An expression such as {{math|''a'' − ''b''}} may still be impossible, so in universal arithmetic there is always a proviso, ''provided the operation is possible''. The third stage is ''single algebra'', where the symbol may denote a quantity forwards or a quantity backwards, and is adequately represented by segments on a straight line passing through an origin. Negative quantities are then no longer impossible; they are represented by the backward segment. But an impossibility still remains in the latter part of such an expression as {{math|''a'' + ''b''{{sqrt|−1}}}} which arises in the solution of the quadratic equation. The fourth stage is ''double algebra''. The algebraic symbol denotes in general a segment of a line in a given plane. It is a double symbol because it involves two specifications, namely, length, and direction; and {{math|{{sqrt|−1}}}} is interpreted as denoting a quadrant. The expression {{math|''a'' + ''b''{{sqrt|−1}}}} then represents a line in the plane having an abscissa {{mvar|a}} and an ordinate {{mvar|b}}. Argand and Warren carried double algebra so far but they were unable to interpret on this theory such an expression as {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''a''{{sqrt|−1}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}. De Morgan attempted it by ''reducing'' such an expression to the form {{math|''b'' + ''q''{{sqrt|−1}}}}, and he considered that he had shown that it could be always so reduced. The remarkable fact is that this double algebra satisfies all the fundamental laws above enumerated, and as every apparently impossible combination of symbols has been interpreted it looks like the complete form of algebra. In chapter&amp;nbsp;6 he introduced [[hyperbolic function]]s and discussed the connection of common and hyperbolic trigonometry.

If the above theory is true, the next stage of development ought to be ''triple'' algebra and if {{math|''a'' + ''b''{{sqrt|−1}}}} truly represents a line in a given plane, it ought to be possible to find a third term which added to the above would represent a line in space. Argand and some others guessed that it was {{math|''a'' + ''b''{{sqrt|−1}} + ''c''{{sqrt|−1}}&lt;sup&gt;{{sqrt|−1}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} although this contradicts the truth established by Euler that {{math|{{sqrt|−1}}&lt;sup&gt;{{sqrt|−1}}&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−π/2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. De Morgan and many others worked hard at the problem, but nothing came of it until the problem was taken up by Hamilton. We now see the reason clearly: The symbol of double algebra denotes not a length and a direction; but a multiplier and ''an angle''. In it the angles are confined to one plane. Hence the next stage will be a ''quadruple algebra'', when the axis of the plane is made variable. And this gives the answer to the first question; double algebra is nothing but analytical plane trigonometry, and this is why it has been found to be the natural analysis for alternating currents. But De Morgan never got this far. He died with the belief that “double algebra must remain as the full development of the conceptions of arithmetic, so far as those symbols are concerned which arithmetic immediately suggests”.

In Book II, Chapter II, following the above quoted passage about the theory of symbolic algebra, De Morgan proceeds to give an inventory of the fundamental symbols of algebra, and also an inventory of the laws of algebra. The symbols are &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\div&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;()&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;()&lt;/sup&gt;, and letters; these only, all others are derived.  As De Morgan explains, the last of these symbols represents writing a latter expression in superscript over and after a former.  His inventory of the fundamental laws is expressed under fourteen heads, but some of them are merely definitions.  The preceding list of symbols is the matter under the first of these heads.  The laws proper may be reduced to the following, which, as he admits, are not all independent of one another, "but the unsymmetrical character of the exponential operation, and the want of the connecting process of &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; ... renders it necessary to state them separately":

#Identity laws.  &lt;math&gt;a = 0+a&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= +a&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= a+0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= a-0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= 1 \times a &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= \times a&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= a \times 1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= a \div 1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= 0 + 1 \times a&lt;/math&gt;
#Law of signs.  &lt;math&gt;+(+a) = +a,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+(-a) = -a,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;-(+a) = -a,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;-(-a) = +a,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times (\times a) = \times a,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times (\div a) = \div a,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\div (\times a) = \div a,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\div (\div a) = \times a&lt;/math&gt;
#Commutative law.  &lt;math&gt; a + b = b + a,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;a \times b = b \times a&lt;/math&gt;
#Distributive law.  &lt;math&gt;a(b + c) = ab + ac,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;a(b - c) = ab - ac,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(b + c) \div a = (b \div a) + (c \div a),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(b - c) \div a = (b \div a) - (c \div a)&lt;/math&gt;
#Index laws.  &lt;math&gt;a^0=1,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;a^1=a,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(a \times b)^c = a^c \times b^c,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;a^b \times a^c = a^{b+c},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(a^b)^c = a^ {b \times c}&lt;/math&gt;

De Morgan professes to give a complete inventory of the laws which the symbols of algebra must obey, for he says, "Any system of symbols which obeys these rules and no others—except they be formed by combination of these rules—and which uses the preceding symbols and no others—except they be new symbols invented in abbreviation of combinations of these symbols—is ''symbolic algebra''." From his point of view, none of the above principles are rules; they are formal laws, that is, arbitrarily chosen relations to which the algebraic symbols must be subject. He does not mention the law, which had already been pointed out by Gregory, namely, &lt;math&gt;(a+b)+c = a+(b+c), (ab)c = a(bc)&lt;/math&gt; and to which was afterwards given the name ''Law of association''. If the commutative law fails, the associative may hold good; but not ''vice versa''. It is an unfortunate thing for the symbolist or formalist that in universal arithmetic &lt;math&gt;m^n&lt;/math&gt; is not equal to &lt;math&gt;n^m&lt;/math&gt;; for then the commutative law would have full scope. Why does he not give it full scope? Because the foundations of algebra are, after all, real not formal, material not symbolic. To the formalists the index operations are exceedingly refractory, in consequence of which some take no account of them, but relegate them to applied mathematics.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} To give an inventory of the laws which the symbols of algebra must obey is an impossible task, and reminds one not a little of the task of those philosophers who attempt to give an inventory of the ''a priori'' knowledge of the mind.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}{{or|The end of this paragraph reads like editorial commentary, it does not appear necessarily to be a published opinion, and its relevance specifically to the subject of the mathematician De Morgan is also questionable.|date=July 2015}}

===''Formal Logic''===
{{further|De Morgan's laws}}

When the study of mathematics revived at the University of Cambridge, so did the study of logic. The moving spirit was Whewell, the Master of Trinity College, whose principal writings were a ''History of the Inductive Sciences'', and ''Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences''. Doubtless De Morgan was influenced in his logical investigations by Whewell; but other influential contemporaries were Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]] at Dublin, and [[George Boole]] at Cork. De Morgan's work, ''Formal Logic'', published in 1847, is principally remarkable for his development of the numerically definite [[syllogism]]. The followers of [[Aristotle]] say that from two particular propositions such as ''Some M's are A's'', and ''Some M's are B's'' nothing follows of necessity about the relation of the A's and B's. But they go further and say in order that any relation about the A's and B's may follow of necessity, the middle term must be taken universally in one of the premises. De Morgan pointed out that from ''Most M's are A's and Most M's are B's'' it follows of necessity that ''some A's are B's'' and he formulated the numerically definite syllogism which puts this principle in exact quantitative form. Suppose that the number of the M's is &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, of the M's that are A's is &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and of the M's that are B's is &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;; then there are at least &lt;math&gt;(a + b - m)&lt;/math&gt; A's that are B's. Suppose that the number of souls on board a steamer was 1000, that 500 were in the saloon, and 700 were lost. It follows of necessity, that at least 700 + 500 – 1000, that is, 200, saloon passengers were lost. This single principle suffices to prove the validity of all the Aristotelian moods. It is therefore a fundamental principle in necessary reasoning.

Here then De Morgan had made a great advance by introducing ''quantification of the terms''. At that time [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]] was teaching in [[Edinburgh]] a doctrine of the quantification of the predicate, and a correspondence sprang up. However, De Morgan soon perceived that Hamilton's quantification was of a different character; that it meant for example, substituting the two forms ''The whole of A is the whole of B'', and ''The whole of A is a part of B'' for the Aristotelian form ''All A's are B's''. Hamilton thought that he had placed the keystone in the Aristotelian arch, as he phrased it. Although it must have been a curious arch which could stand 2000 years without a keystone. As a consequence he had no room for De Morgan's innovations. He accused De Morgan of plagiarism, and the controversy raged for years in the columns of the ''Athenæum'', and in the publications of the two writers.

The memoirs on logic which De Morgan contributed to the ''Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society'' subsequent to the publication of his book ''Formal Logic'' are by far the most important contributions which he made to the science, especially his fourth memoir, in which he begins work in the broad field of the "logic of relatives".

===''Budget of Paradoxes''===
In the introduction to the ''Budget of Paradoxes'' De Morgan explains what he means by the word.
:A great many individuals, ever since the rise of the mathematical method, have, each for himself, attacked its direct and indirect consequences. I shall call each of these persons a ''paradoxer'', and his system a ''paradox''. I use the word in the old sense: a paradox is something which is apart from general opinion, either in subject matter, method, or conclusion. Many of the things brought forward would now be called ''crotchets'', which is the nearest word we have to old ''paradox''. But there is this difference, that by calling a thing a crotchet we mean to speak lightly of it; which was not the necessary sense of paradox. Thus in the 16th century many spoke of the earth's motion as the ''paradox of Copernicus'' and held the ingenuity of that theory in very high esteem, and some I think who even inclined towards it. In the seventeenth century the deprivation of meaning took place, in England at least.

How can the sound paradoxer be distinguished from the false paradoxer? De Morgan supplies the following test:
:The manner in which a paradoxer will show himself, as to sense or nonsense, will not depend upon what he maintains, but upon whether he has or has not made a sufficient knowledge of what has been done by others, especially as to the mode of doing it, a preliminary to inventing knowledge for himself&amp;nbsp;... New knowledge, when to any purpose, must come by contemplation of old knowledge, in every matter which concerns thought; mechanical contrivance sometimes, not very often, escapes this rule. All the men who are now called discoverers, in every matter ruled by thought, have been men versed in the minds of their predecessors and learned in what had been before them. There is not one exception.

The ''Budget'' consists of a review of a large collection of paradoxical books which De Morgan had accumulated in his own library, partly by purchase at bookstands, partly from books sent to him for review, partly from books sent to him by the authors. He gives the following classification: squarers of the circle, trisectors of the angle, duplicators of the cube, constructors of perpetual motion, subverters of gravitation, stagnators of the earth, builders of the universe. You will still find specimens of all these classes in the New World and in the new century. De Morgan gives his personal knowledge of paradoxers.
{{quote|I suspect that I know more of the English class than any man in Britain. I never kept any reckoning: but I know that one year with another?&amp;nbsp; and less of late years than in earlier time?&amp;nbsp;– I have talked to more than five in each year, giving more than a hundred and fifty specimens. Of this I am sure, that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they naturally resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is ''bona fide'', the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many&amp;nbsp;– the mass, indeed&amp;nbsp;– are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.}}

A paradoxer to whom De Morgan paid the compliment which Achilles paid Hector — to drag him round the walls again and again — was James Smith, a successful merchant of Liverpool. He found &lt;math&gt;\pi = 3 \tfrac{1}{8}&lt;/math&gt;. His mode of reasoning was a curious caricature of the ''reductio ad absurdum'' of Euclid. He said let &lt;math&gt;\pi = 3 \tfrac{1}{8}&lt;/math&gt;, and then showed that on that supposition, every other value of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; must be absurd. Consequently, &lt;math&gt;\pi = 3\tfrac{1}{8}&lt;/math&gt; is the true value. The following is a specimen of De Morgan's dragging round the walls of Troy:

{{quote|Mr. Smith continues to write me long letters, to which he hints that I am to answer. In his last of 31 closely written sides of note paper, he informs me, with reference to my obstinate silence, that though I think myself and am thought by others to be a mathematical Goliath, I have resolved to play the mathematical snail, and keep within my shell. A mathematical ''snail''! This cannot be the thing so called which regulates the striking of a clock; for it would mean that I am to make Mr. Smith sound the true time of day, which I would by no means undertake upon a clock that gains 19 seconds odd in every hour by false quadrative value of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. But he ventures to tell me that pebbles from the sling of simple truth and common sense will ultimately crack my shell, and put me ''hors de combat''. The confusion of images is amusing: Goliath turning himself into a snail to avoid &lt;math&gt;\pi = 3\tfrac{1}{8}&lt;/math&gt; and James Smith, Esq., of the Mersey Dock Board: and put ''hors de combat'' by pebbles from a sling. If Goliath had crept into a snail shell, David would have cracked the Philistine with his foot. There is something like modesty in the implication that the crack-shell pebble has not yet taken effect; it might have been thought that the slinger would by this time have been singing — And thrice [and one-eighth] I routed all my foes, And thrice [and one-eighth] I slew the slain.}}

In the region of pure mathematics, De Morgan could detect easily the false from the true paradox; but he was not so proficient in the field of physics. His father-in-law was a paradoxer, and his wife a paradoxer; and in the opinion of the physical philosophers De Morgan himself scarcely escaped. His wife wrote a book describing the phenomena of spiritualism, table-rapping, [[table-turning]], etc.; and De Morgan wrote a preface in which he said that he knew some of the asserted facts, believed others on testimony, but did not pretend to know ''whether'' they were caused by spirits, or had some unknown and unimagined origin. From this alternative he left out ordinary material causes. Faraday delivered a lecture on ''Spiritualism'', in which he laid it down that in the investigation we ought to set out with the idea of what is physically possible, or impossible; De Morgan did not believe this.

===Relations===
De Morgan developed the [[calculus of relations]] in his ''Syllabus of a Proposed System of Logic'' (1966: 208–46), first published in 1860. De Morgan was able to show that reasoning with [[syllogism]]s could be replaced with [[composition of relations]].{{sfn|Merrill|2012|p=49}} The calculus was described as the [[logic of relatives]] by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who admired De Morgan and met him shortly before his death. The calculus was further extended in the third volume of [[Ernst Schröder]]'s ''Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik''. [[Binary relation]]s, especially [[order theory]], proved critical to the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' of [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. In turn, this calculus became the subject of much further work, starting in 1940, by [[Alfred Tarski]] and his colleagues and students at the [[University of California]].

==Spiritualism==
De Morgan later in his life became interested in the phenomena of [[spiritualism]]. In 1849 he had investigated [[clairvoyance]] and was impressed by the subject. He later carried out paranormal investigations in his own home with the medium Maria Hayden. The result of these investigations was later published by his wife Sophia. De Morgan believed that his career as a scientist might have been affected if he had revealed his interest in the study of spiritualism so he helped to publish the book anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Geoffrey K. |last=Nelson |title=Spiritualism and Society |location= |publisher= |year=1969 |page=90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVBAAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published in 1863 titled ''From Matter to Spirit: The Result of Ten Years Experience in Spirit Manifestations''.

According to historian [[Janet Oppenheim]], De Morgan's wife Sophia was a convinced spiritualist but De Morgan shared a third way position on spiritualist phenomena which she defined as a "wait-and-see position", he was neither a believer nor a skeptic, instead his viewpoint was that the methodology of the physical sciences does not automatically exclude [[psychic phenomena]] and that such phenomena may be explainable in time by the possible existence of natural forces which as yet physicists had not identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Janet |last=Oppenheim |title=The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850–1914 |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-521-34767-X |page=335 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcBs8enYCCcC&amp;pg=PA335 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the preface of ''From Matter to Spirit'' (1863) De Morgan stated:
{{quote|Thinking it very likely that the universe may contain a few agencies&amp;nbsp;– say half a million&amp;nbsp;– about which no man knows anything, I can not but suspect that a small proportion of these agencies&amp;nbsp;– say five thousand&amp;nbsp;– may be severally competent to the production of all the [spiritualist] phenomena, or may be quite up to the task among them. The physical explanations which I have seen are easy, but miserably insufficient: the spiritualist hypothesis is sufficient, but ponderously difficult. Time and thought will decide, the second asking the first for more results of trial.}}

Psychical researcher [[John Beloff]] wrote that De Morgan was the first notable scientist in Britain to take an interest in the study of spiritualism and his studies had influenced the decision of [[William Crookes]] to also study spiritualism. He also claims that De Morgan was an [[atheist]] and that this debarred him from a position at Oxford or Cambridge.{{sfn |Beloff|1997|pp=46–47}}

==Legacy==
Beyond his great mathematical legacy, the headquarters of the London Mathematical Society is called ''De Morgan House'' and the student society of the Mathematics Department of University College London is called the Augustus De Morgan Society.

The crater [[De Morgan (crater)|De Morgan]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.

'''The British Scholar Society''' is a [[scholarly society]] focusing on Britain's role in the world from the seventeenth century to the present. It puts out a bi-annual [[academic journal]] published by [[Edinburgh University Press]] entitled ''Britain and the World: Historical Journal of The British Scholar Society'', as well as a "Britain and the World" book series with [[Palgrave Macmillan]]. The British Scholar Society also organizes a yearly academic conference, which has been held in both US and UK locations. Launched in 2006, the British Scholar Society is currently chaired by Martin Farr of [[Newcastle University]]. The chair of its advisory board is [[Linda Colley]] of [[Princeton University]]. The British Scholar Society describes its membership as "people from around the world who share a common interest in Britain, its history, and its interactions with the wider world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishscholar.org/aboutus.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708193640/http://www.britishscholar.org/aboutus.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-07-08 |title=British Scholar Journal |work= |accessdate=2009-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cittadella of Alessandria''' ({{lang-it|Cittadella di Alessandria}}) is a [[star fort]] and [[citadel]] in the city of [[Alessandria]], [[Italy]]. It was built in the 18th century by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], and today it is one of the best preserved fortifications of that era. It is one of the few fortifications in Europe still in their original environment, since there are no buildings blocking the views of the [[Defensive wall|ramparts]], or a road that surrounds the [[Ditch (fortification)|ditches]].

On 10 March 1821, during the [[Italian unification#Piedmont insurrection|Piedmont insurrection]], the blue, red and black [[Tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] of the [[Carbonari]] was raised on the Cittadella's bastions by Colonel Ansaldi. This was the first use of a tricolour flag in the history of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giovanni Spadolini]], preface to ''La Cittadella di Alessandria, una fortezza per il territorio dal settecento all'unità'' by Anna Marotta . SO.G.ED. 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cittadella has been Italy's tentative list of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citadel of Alessandria|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5013|website=UNESCO Tentative List|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The fortress lies across the river [[Tanaro (river)|Tanaro]] in the north-west side of the city of [[Alessandria]]. The site is one of the lowest in the [[Piedmont]] region with an altitude of about {{convert|90|m}} above sea-level.

==History==

===Social, historical and geopolitical context===
[[File:Western Europe Utrecht Treaty.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Map of Europe according to the Treaty of Utrecht]]

Since its foundation, 1168, the town of [[Alessandria]] was always meant to be a border town with a strategic-military vocation. From the 14th century has joined the [[House of Visconti|Visconti]] of [[Milan]] against [[Monferrato]] and [[Asti]], with the Sforza then in the 15th century, and consequently under the [[Spaniards]] rule after, throughout the 17th century.

The construction of the fortress began immediately after the signing of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713. The treaty handed ownership of the Citadel from the Spaniards to the [[House of Savoy]]. A massive fortification project followed, during which much of Alessandria's town-planning were changed to bolster the fortress's defenses.

In order to meet the needs of defense of the new state of Savoy, it was decided to build a massive fortress designed to function as a barrier of military transits traveling along the "Road of [[Flanders]]", the ancient Spanish military road that connected the harbors of [[Genova]], [[Savona]] and [[Finale Ligure]] with the [[Netherlands]].

===18th century===

====Construction====
The Citadel plan was commissioned by King [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Vittorio Amedeo II]] and effectively built, in 1732, by King [[Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia|Charles Emmanuel III]]. The project's architect was [[Ignazio Bertola]]. The fortress is a six-star hexagon shaped structure.

The Citadel was built entirely at the expense of the ancient quarter of Borgoglio (or Bergoglio) provoking strong urban revolution. It was completed in its main components in the forties of the 18th century while inside the fortified hexagon the buildings of the civilians were gradually demolished to make way for new military quarters and the inhabitants were forced to relocate, replaced by a garrison ever more numerous.

The result is an immense fortress which extends over {{convert|74|ha}} whose longer side is parallel to the axis of the river. The Citadel is a perfect example of modern fortress composed of six bastioned fronts supplied with ''cavalieri'' crossed by [[tunnels]] and [[casemates]]. The fortress is surrounded by a wide [[moat]], in connection with the Tanaro river through flooding tunnels, scheduled to be flooded by the waters of the river, and protected by ''tenaglioni'', [[ravelin]]s, [[counterguard]]s and ''ridottes''.

The entrance is by a long stone bridge that leads to a large area surrounded by multi-storey buildings arranged along the axis of the ancient quarter, all protected by resistant [[Levee|embankments]] constructed between 1749 and 1831.

====The War of the Austrian Succession====
The Citadel was tested by fire the first time between 1745 and 1746 when it resisted the French-Spanish army for seven months, during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The Citadel was still incomplete and not well armed.

====First Italian Campaign====
At the end of the [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars#Bonaparte's war|First Italian Campaign]], the Citadel was in the hands of the French: in July 1799 it was under siege by the Austro-Russian Army led by [[Aleksandr Vasilyevich Suvorov]]. After three days of bombing were inflicted serious damage to the fortified structures and the French were forced to surrender.

===19th century===

====French occupation====
Following the [[Battle of Marengo]] and the proclamation of the [[First French Empire]], [[Napoleon]] expanded and renovated the fort to support the operations of the [[Army of Italy (France)|French army in Italy]]. During the French occupation, the citadel became one of the most important fortresses in the French Empire, since it was intended to be the "eastern gateway" of France.

====European restoration====
In 1814 the Austrian army captured the fort and transferred it to the restored [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. The fort was renovated, and by the mid-19th century it became an important bulwark against the Austrian Empire.

====Risorgimento====
On 10 March 1821, the Cittadella's garrison mutinied, marking the beginning of the [[Italian unification#Piedmont insurrection|Piedmont insurrection]], and Colonel Ansaldi raised the blue, red and black [[Tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] of the [[Carbonari]] on the bastions. The insurrection spread quickly throughout Piedmont, but it was suppressed by the Austrians at the end of April. The Austrians subsequently took over the fort and occupied it until 1823. Various [[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]] affiliates were imprisoned in the fort, and five were executed by firing squad in 1833.

After the Austrians defeated the Kingdom of Sardinia during the [[Battle of Novara (1849)|Battle of Novara]] in 1849, the fort was again occupied by Austrian forces for three months. After the Alessandria was back in Sardinian hands, the number of guns within the Cittadella was increased, and three nearby Napoleonic forts ([[Forte Ferrovia]], [[Forte Bormida]] and [[Forte Acqui]]) were strengthened. The fort saw use during the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] of 1859, and [[Napoleon III]] spent some time there during the war.

====Kingdom of Italy====
Following the [[Italian unification]] and the proclamation of the [[Kingdom of Italy]], Alessandria became a defensive centre of the kingdom's western border. In 1889, the Cittadella's status changed to command headquarters and barracks. Nonetheless, it remained a key site for the [[Royal Italian Army]].

===20th century===
In 1901 the Army Corps of Engineers decommissioned the citadel's ''cinta magistrale''. The Forte di Acqui, the Opera di Valenza and the citadel's [[outwork]]s were decommissioned in 1904.

Several regiments were stationed in the Cittadella, including the 37th and 38th Infantry Regiments, which formed part of the [[3rd Mountain Infantry Division Ravenna]].

====World War II====
The Governor's Palace in the Cittadella was declared a National Monument by [[royal charter]] dated 17 May 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Summario - Leggi e Decreti|url=http://www.monumentinazionali.it/leggi_e_decreti/1943151_P1.pdf|accessdate=20 August 2015|work=Gazzetta Ufficiale del Regno d'Italia|date=2 July 1943|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 1943, the Germans entered Alessandria and captured the Cittadella after a short bombardment. The Italian garrison surrendered and were deported to Germany.
The city of Alessandria was heavily bombed on 5 September 1944, but the Cittadella did not suffer a lot of damage. However, a bomb shelter located near the fort was hit, killing 39 civilians.

The Cittadella was captured by [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]] in 1945, and it subsequently became the seat of the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]].

====Post-war era====
From 1953 to 1962, the citadel was home to the 52nd Artillery Regiment "Torino". It was then used for logistics functions and as a magazine.

In 1994, the citadel was flooded by the river, and many buildings were severely damaged. Today, some areas are still filled with mud from the flood.

===21st century===
The Cittadella was officially decommissioned in 2007, when the [[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Ministry of Defence]] handed it over to the Italian Public Property Agency.

On 18 June 2010, a permanent exhibition of about 1500 uniforms, weapons and memorabilia of the [[Royal Italian Army]] was established within the fort.

In 2014, the Cittadella was listed as one of "The 7 Most Endangered" sites by [[Europa Nostra]], mainly due to the spread of weeds which threatens the fortification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citadel of Alessandria|url=http://www.europanostra.org/read--amp--share/173/|website=[[Europa Nostra]]|accessdate=20 August 2015|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''order''' in architecture is a certain assemblage of parts subject to uniform established proportions, regulated by the office that each part has to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=6-1LAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=%22An%20order%20in%20architecture%20is%20a%20certain%20assemblage%20of%20parts%20subject%20to%20uniform%20established%20proportions,%20regulated%20by%20the%20office%20that%20each%20part%20has%20to%20perform%22&amp;f=false|title=An Encyclopædia of Architecture: Historical, Theoretical, and Practical|last=Gwilt|first=Joseph|date=1842|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans|year=|isbn=|location=London|pages=680|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Coming down to the present from [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman]] civilization, the '''architectural orders''' are the styles of [[classical architecture]], each distinguished by its proportions and characteristic profiles and details, and most readily recognizable by the type of [[column]] employed. The three orders of architecture—the [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]—originated in Greece. To these the Romans added, in practice if not in name, the [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], which they made simpler than Doric, and the [[Composite order|Composite]], which was more ornamental than the Corinthian.  The architectural order of a classical building is akin to the [[Musical mode|mode]] or [[Key (music)|key]] of [[classical music]], the [[grammar]] or [[rhetoric]] of a written composition.  It is established by certain ''modules'' like the [[Interval (music)|intervals]] of music, and it raises certain expectations in an audience attuned to its language.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 7-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the orders were essentially structural in [[Ancient Greek architecture]], which made little use of the arch until its late period, in [[Roman architecture]] where the arch was often dominant, the orders became increasingly decorative elements except in [[portico]]s and similar uses.  Columns shrank into half-columns emerging from walls or turned into [[pilaster]]s.  This treatment continued after the conscious and "correct" use of the orders, initially following exclusively Roman models, returned in the [[Italian Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Greek Revival architecture]], inspired by increasing knowledge of Greek originals, returned to more authentic models, including ones from relatively early periods.

== Elements ==
[[File:Table of architecture, Cyclopaedia, 1728, volume 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Table of architecture, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', 1728]]

Each style has distinctive [[capital (architecture)|capital]]s at the top of columns and horizontal [[entablature]]s which it supports, while the rest of the building does not in itself vary between the orders.  The column shaft and base also varies with the order, and is sometimes articulated with vertical hollow grooves known as [[Fluting (architecture)|fluting]].  The shaft is wider at the bottom than at the top, because its [[entasis]], beginning a third of the way up, imperceptibly makes the column slightly more slender at the top, although some Doric columns, especially early Greek ones, are visibly "flared", with straight profiles that narrow going up the shaft.

The capital rests on the shaft. It has a load-bearing function, which concentrates the weight of the entablature on the supportive column, but it primarily serves an aesthetic purpose.  The necking is the continuation of the shaft, but is visually separated by one or many grooves. The [[Molding (decorative)|echinus]] lies atop the necking.  It is a circular block that bulges outwards towards the top to support the [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]], which is a square or shaped block that in turn supports the entablature.  The entablature consists of three horizontal layers, all of which are visually separated from each other using moldings or bands.  In Roman and post-Renaissance work, the entablature may be carried from column to column in the form of an [[arch]] that springs from the column that bears its weight, retaining its divisions and sculptural enrichment, if any.  There are names for all the many parts of the orders.

== Measurement ==
[[File:Schema Saeulenordnungen.jpg|thumb|left|Greek orders with full height]] 
The height of columns are calculated in terms of a ratio between the diameter of the shaft at its base and the height of the column. A Doric column can be described as seven diameters high, an Ionic column as eight diameters high and a Corinthian column nine diameters high, although the actual ratios used vary considerably in both ancient and revived examples, but keeping to the trend of increasing slimness between the orders. Sometimes this is phrased as "lower diameters high", to establish which part of the shaft has been measured.

== Greek orders ==
There are three distinct orders in Ancient Greek architecture: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. These three were adopted by the Romans, who modified their capitals. The Roman adoption of the Greek orders took place in the 1st century BC. The three Ancient Greek orders have since been consistently used in neo-classical European architecture.

Sometimes the Doric order is considered the earliest order, but there is no evidence to support this.  Rather, the Doric and Ionic orders seem to have appeared at around the same time, the Ionic in eastern Greece and the Doric in the west and mainland.

Both the Doric and the Ionic order appear to have originated in wood. The [[Temple of Hera (Olympia)|Temple of Hera]] in Olympia is the oldest well-preserved temple of Doric architecture. It was built just after 600 BC. The Doric order later spread across Greece and into [[Sicily]] where it was the chief order for [[monumental architecture]] for 800 years.  Early Greeks were no doubt aware of the use of stone columns with bases and capitals in [[Ancient Egyptian architecture]], and that of other Near Eastern cultures, although there they were mostly used in interiors, rather than as a dominant feature of all or part of exteriors, in the Greek style.  
[[File:DoricParthenon.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Doric order of the [[Parthenon]]]]

=== Doric order===
{{Main|Doric order}}
The Doric order originated on the mainland and western [[Greece]]. It is the simplest of the orders, characterized by short, organized, heavy columns with plain, round [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s (tops) and no base. With a height that is only four to eight times its diameter, the columns are the most squat of all orders. The shaft of the Doric order is channeled with 16 flutes. The capital consists of a necking or Annulet which is a simple ring. The echinus is convex, or circular cushion like stone, and the abacus is square slab of stone.

Above the capital is a square [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]] connecting the capital to the entablature.  The Entablature is divided into three horizontal registers, the lower part of which is either smooth or divided by horizontal lines.  The upper half is distinctive for the Doric order. The frieze of the Doric entablature is divided into [[triglyph]]s and [[metope (architecture)|metopes]]. A triglyph is a unit consisting of three vertical bands which are separated by grooves. Metopes are the plain or carved reliefs between two triglyphs.

The Greek forms of the Doric order come without an individual base. They instead are placed directly on the [[stylobate]]. Later forms, however, came with the conventional base consisting of a plinth and a torus. The Roman versions of the Doric order have smaller proportions. As a result, they appear lighter than the Greek orders.

[[File:IonicCapitalPriene.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Ionic order]]

=== Ionic order ===
{{Main|Ionic order}}
The Ionic order came from eastern Greece, where its origins are entwined with the similar but little known [[Aeolic order]]. It is distinguished by slender, fluted [[column|pillar]]s with a large base and two opposed ''volutes'' (also called ''scrolls'') in the echinus of the capital. The echinus itself is decorated with an [[egg-and-dart]] [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]. The Ionic shaft comes with four more flutes than the Doric counterpart (totalling 24). The Ionic base has two convex moldings called ''tori'' which are separated by a scotia.

The Ionic order is also marked by an [[entasis]], a curved tapering in the column shaft. A column of the ionic order is nine times its lower diameter. The shaft itself is eight diameters high. The architrave of the entablature commonly consists of three stepped bands (''fasciae''). The frieze comes without the Doric ''triglyph'' and ''metope''. The frieze sometimes comes with a continuous ornament such as carved figures instead.

[[File:CorinthianOrderPantheon.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Corinthian order]]

=== Corinthian order ===
{{Main|Corinthian order}}
The Corinthian order is the most ornate of the Greek orders, characterized by a slender fluted column having an ornate capital decorated with two rows of acanthus leaves and four scrolls. It is commonly regarded as the most elegant of the three orders.  The shaft of the Corinthian order has 24 flutes. The column is commonly ten diameters high.

The Roman writer [[Vitruvius]] [[Callimachus (sculptor)#Architecture|credited]] the invention of the Corinthian order to [[Callimachus (sculptor)|Callimachus]], a Greek [[sculpture|sculptor]] of the 5th century BC. The oldest known building built according to this order is the [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates]] in Athens, constructed from 335 to 334 BC. The Corinthian order was raised to rank by the writings of Vitruvius in the 1st century BC.

== Roman orders ==
The Romans adapted all the Greek orders and also developed two orders of their own, basically modifications of Greek orders. However, it was not until the Renaissance that these were named and formalized as the [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] and [[Composite order|Composite]], respectively the plainest and most ornate of the orders.  The Romans also invented the [[superposed order]]. A superposed order is when successive stories of a building have different orders. The heaviest orders were at the bottom, whilst the lightest came at the top. This means that the Doric order was the order of the ground floor, the Ionic order was used for the middle story, while the Corinthian or the Composite order was used for the top story.

The [[Colossal order]] was invented by [[Renaissance architecture|architects in the Renaissance]]. The Colossal order is characterized by columns that extend the height of two or more stories.
[[File:PalladioTuscan.jpg|thumb|150px|The Tuscan order in [[Andrea Palladio]], ''Quattro Libri di Architettura,'' 1570]]

=== Tuscan order ===
{{Main|Tuscan order}}
The Tuscan order has a very plain design, with a plain shaft, and a simple capital, base, and frieze. It is a simplified adaptation of the Doric order by the Greeks. The Tuscan order is characterized by an unfluted shaft and a capital that only consists of an echinus and an abacus. In proportions it is similar to the Doric order, but overall it is significantly plainer. The column is normally seven diameters high. Compared to the other orders, the Tuscan order looks the most solid.

[[File:Komposita1.png|right|thumb|150px|Composite order]]

=== Composite order ===
{{Main|Composite order}}
The Composite order is a mixed order, combining the volutes of the Ionic with the leaves of the Corinthian order. Until the [[Renaissance]] it was not ranked as a separate order. Instead it was considered as a late Roman form of the Corinthian order. The column of the Composite order is typically ten diameters high.

== Historical development of the orders ==
[[File:StGervais Fassade.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais Church]] in Paris presents columns of the three orders : Doric at the ground floor, Ionic at the second floor, Corinthian at the third floor]]
[[File:Bodleian Library 2 (5650412310).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Tower of The Five Orders at the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]], completed in 1619, includes Tuscan through Composite orders.]]
The [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] period saw renewed interest in the literary sources of the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome, and the fertile development of a new architecture based on classical principles. The treatise ''[[De architectura]]'' by Roman theoretician, architect and engineer [[Vitruvius]], is the only architectural writing that survived from Antiquity. Rediscovered in the 15th century, Vitruvius was instantly hailed as the authority on architecture. However, in his text the word ''order'' is not to be found. To describe the four species of columns (he only mentions: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic and Corinthian) he uses, in fact, various words such as: ''genus'' (gender), ''mos'' (habit, fashion, manner), ''opera'' (work).

The term ''order'', as well as the idea of redefining the ''canon'' started circulating in Rome, at the beginning of the 16th century, probably during the studies of Vitruvius' text conducted and shared by Peruzzi, Raphael and Sangallo.&lt;ref&gt;H. Burns and H. Gunthers, ''24éme Colloque International d'Etude Humanistes'', Tours 1981&lt;/ref&gt;
Ever since, the definition of the ''canon'' has been a collective endeavor that involved several generations of European architects, from Renaissance and Baroque periods, basing their theories both on the study of Vitruvius' writings and the observation of Roman ruins (the Greek ruins became available only after Greek Independence, 1821–23). What was added were rules for the use of the Architectural Orders, and the exact proportions of them down to the most minute detail. Commentary on the appropriateness of the orders for temples devoted to particular deities (Vitruvius I.2.5) were elaborated by Renaissance theorists, with Doric characterized as bold and manly, Ionic as matronly, and Corinthian as maidenly.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Small, [http://sites.scran.ac.uk/ada/documents/general/orders/classical_orders.htm "The five orders of classical architecture"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vignola defining the concept of "order" ==
{{Main|The Five Orders of Architecture}}
 
Following the examples of Vitruvius and the five books of the ''Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici'' by [[Sebastiano Serlio]], published from 1537 onwards, [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]] produced an architecture rule book that was not only more practical than the previous two treatises, but also was systematically and consistently adopting, for the first time,  the term '''order''' to define each of the five different species of columns inherited from Antiquity. A first publication of the various plates, as separate sheets, appeared in Rome in 1562, with the title: ''Regola delli Cinque Ordini di Architettura'' (''Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture ''&lt;ref&gt;The most recent English translation is the one, with an introduction and commentary by Branko Mitrovic, N.Y. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;). As David Watkin has pointed out, Vignola's book "was to have an astonishing publishing history of over 500 editions in 400 years in ten languages, Italian, Dutch, English, Flemish, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, during which it became perhaps the most influential book of all times".&lt;ref&gt;David Watkin, Introduction to the ''Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture'', translated by John Leeke, reprint of the 1699 edition, N.Y., 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
The book consisted simply of an introduction followed by 32 annotated plates, highlighting the proportional system with all the minute details of the Five Architectural Orders. According to Christof Thoenes, the main expert of Renaissance architectural treatises,  "in accordance with Vitruvius’s example, Vignola chose a “module” equal to a half-diameter which is the base of the system. All the other measurements are expressed in fractions or in multiples of this module. The result is an arithmetical model, and with its help each order, harmoniously proportioned, can easily be adapted to any given height, of a façade or an interior. From this point of view, Vignola's Regola is a remarkable intellectual achievement".[http://architectura.cesr.univ-tours.fr/traite/Notice/ENSBA_LES64.asp?param=en]

In America, ''The American Builder's Companion'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Benjamin| first = Asher| title = The American Builder's Companion: Or, a System of Architecture Particularly Adapted to the Present Style of Building| year = 1827| publisher = Dover Publications| isbn = 978-0-486-22236-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; written in the early 19th century by the architect [[Asher Benjamin]], influenced many builders in the eastern states, particularly those who developed what became known as the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]]. The last American re-interpretation of Vignola's ''Regola'', was edited in 1904 by William Robert Ware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ware| first = William R.| title = The American Vignola: a guide to the making of classical architecture| url = https://books.google.com/?id=nV3eiQFnwyAC| year = 1994| publisher = Courier Dover Publications| isbn = 978-0-486-28310-4| pages = 160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The break from the classical mode came first with the [[Gothic revival]], then the development of modernism during the 19th century. The [[Bauhaus]] promoted pure functionalism, stripped of superfluous ornament, and that has become one of the defining characteristics of modern architecture. There are some exceptions. [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodernism]] introduced an ironic use of the orders as a cultural reference, divorced from the strict rules of composition. On the other hand, a few practitioners e.g. [[Quinlan Terry]] and Stuart Martin still work in a traditional classical idiom.

== Nonce orders ==
Several orders, usually based upon the composite order and only varying in the design of the capitals, have been invented under the inspiration of specific occasions, but have not been used again. They are termed "''nonce orders''" by analogy to ''[[nonce word]]s''; several examples follow below. 
These nonce orders all express the “speaking architecture” (''[[architecture parlante]]'') that was taught in the Paris courses, most explicitly by [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]], in which sculptural details of classical architecture could be enlisted to speak symbolically, the better to express the purpose of the structure and enrich its visual meaning with specific appropriateness. This idea was taken up strongly in the training of [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], ca 1875–1915. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

;British Order
[[Robert Adam]]'s brother [[James Adam (architect)|James]] was in Rome in 1762, drawing antiquities under the direction of [[Charles-Louis Clérisseau|Clérisseau]]; he invented a '''British Order''' and published an engraving of it. Its capital the heraldic lion and unicorn take the place of the Composite's volutes, a Byzantine or Romanesque conception, but expressed in terms of neoclassical realism. Adam's ink-and-wash rendering with red highlighting is at the [[Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library|Avery Library]], [[Columbia University]].

;Ammonite order and Agricultural order
In 1789 [[George Dance the Elder|George Dance]] invented an '''[[Ammonite Order]]''', a variant of Ionic substituting volutes in the form of [[fossil]] [[ammonite]]s for [[John Boydell]]'s [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery|Shakespeare Gallery]] in [[Pall Mall, London]].&lt;ref name="oxford22"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Curl |first1=James Stevens |last2=Wilson |first2=Susan |title=Oxford Dictionary of Architecture |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-967499-2 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adaptation of the Corinthian order by [[William Donthorne]] that used turnip leaves and [[mangelwurzel]] is termed the '''Agricultural order'''.&lt;ref&gt;Curl, p.&amp;nbsp;238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curl, p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Corn-capital-litchfield.jpg|thumb|upright|Corn capital at the [[Litchfield Villa]] [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)]] ([[Alexander Jackson Davis|A.J. Davis]], architect)]]
;American orders
In the United States [[Benjamin Latrobe]], the architect of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]] in Washington&amp;nbsp;DC, designed a series of botanically '''American orders'''. Most famous is the order substituting corncobs and their husks, which was executed by [[Giuseppe Franzoni]] and employed in the small domed Vestibule of the Supreme Court. Only the Supreme Court survived the fire of 24&amp;nbsp;August 1814, nearly intact. With peace restored, Latrobe designed an American order that substituted for the acanthus tobacco leaves, of which he sent a sketch to [[Thomas Jefferson]] in a letter, 5&amp;nbsp;November 1816. He was encouraged to send a model of it, which remains at [[Monticello]]. In the 1830s [[Alexander Jackson Davis]] admired it enough to make a drawing of it. In 1809 Latrobe invented a second American order, employing [[magnolia]] flowers constrained within the profile of classical mouldings, as his drawing demonstrates. It was intended for "the Upper Columns in the Gallery of the Entrance of the Chamber of the Senate" ({{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/us.capitol/s4.html |title=United States Capitol exhibit}}).

Collection maintenance is a form of [[collections care]] that consists of the day-to-day hands on care of collections and cultural heritage. The primary goal of '''collections maintenance''' is to prevent further decay of cultural heritage by ensuring proper storage and upkeep including performing regular housekeeping of the spaces and objects and monitoring and controlling storage environments. Collections maintenance is closely linked to [[collections care]] and [[collections management (museum)|collections management]]. The professionals most influenced by collections maintenance include [[collection manager]]s, [[registrar (museum)|registrars]], and [[archivist]]s.

==Environmental Control==
There are four main environmental agents of deterioration which should be monitored on a regular basis as part of maintenance. These are temperature, relative humidity, light and dust. It is important to recognize the type of damage each agent may present as well as ways to mitigate any harm.

===Temperature===
Temperature as an agent of deterioration acts primarily in conjunction with relative humidity but can trigger damage in its own right. At the extremes, temperature can cause structural damage to some materials; paint may become brittle in excessive heat and some plastics may soften or melt in the heat.&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp4"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 4: Museum Collections Environment|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAPTER4.pdf|accessdate= April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; “High temperatures also accelerate chemical and biological processes.” &lt;ref name="Historic House chp 5"&gt;{{cite book|last =Staniforth|first =Sarah|title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =5: Agents of Deterioration|page =51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative Humidity===
[[File:Termoigrografo 01.jpg|thumbnail|A thermo-hygrograph]]

[[Relative Humidity]] (RH) is the amount of water held in the air as related to how much could be held in fully saturated air. The possible amount of moisture held at a given time is directly related to temperature; warm air holds more humidity than cold. Collecting institutions aim to keep the RH constant in exhibitions and storage areas because many organic objects expand and contract as both temperature and RH change.&lt;ref name="Basics ch3"&gt;{{cite book|last =Ambrose|first =Timothy|last2 =Paine|first2 =Crispin |title =Museum Basics|place =London|publisher =Routledge|year =2006|edition =2|chapter =3: The Development and Care of the Museum’s Collections}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furniture will swell and stick with high moisture, but may crack or shrink if there is too little. “Rapidly fluctuating temperature and relative humidity compound all of these effects.” &lt;ref name="Concerns pg15"&gt;{{cite book|last =Bachmann|first =Konstanze|title =Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =Smithsonian Books|year =1992|chapter =Control of Temperature and Humidity in Small Collections|page =15}}&lt;/ref&gt; High humidity may accelerate mold growth and some chemical changes, like metal corrosion, if not properly maintained.&lt;ref name="Housekeeping chp10"&gt;{{cite book|last =Staniforth|first =Sarah|title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =10: Relative Humidity as an Agent of Deterioration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some changes undergone by objects are reversible by adjusting the RH, but damage like cracks are more permanent. Keeping the RH within a reasonable span for the type of object and as consistent as possible will prevent most RH based damage. It is important to measure the RH of spaces regularly by using a number of tools including humidity strips, [[thermo-hygrograph]]s, [[hygrometer]]s, psychrometer and [[data logger]]s. Once the per cent humidity identified, there are a number of ways to adjust it by using humidifiers, dehumidifiers, improve heating and air conditioning systems and adjust the temperature of the space.

===Light===
Light, as it relates to collections maintenance, consists of visual and [[ultraviolet]] light (UV). Both types of light can cause damage as “light radiation falling on a surface provides energy to induce chemical changes in the molecules of the material.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Bullock|first =Linda|title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =9: Light as an Agent of Deterioration|page =93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage from light, including loss of color and strength, is cumulative and irreversible. It is therefore crucial that light levels are monitored.

Preventing light damage is difficult because it is necessary for visitors as well as people who are working with the objects. Exposure, however, can be diminished by ensuring lights are only on when people are present, either by vigilant staff members turning on and off lights, timer switches or with motion sensors.  Natural light from windows should be reduced or eliminated in all spaces by covering them with curtains, shades or UV absorbing filters.&lt;ref name="Concerns"&gt;{{cite book|last =Bachmann|first =Konstanze|title =Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =Smithsonian Books|year =1992|chapter =Principles of Storage}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where lights frequently on, like in galleries and office areas, a [[light meter]] should be used to determine how much exposure the collections are getting at least once a year and adjustments should be made accordingly.&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp4"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 4: Museum Collections Environment|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAPTER4.pdf|accessdate= April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dust and Dirt===
Dust can contain a number of materials including skin, mold and inorganic fragments like silica or sulfur. It is important to keep collections free of dust whenever possible because it can become bound to a surface over time, making it that significantly more difficult to remove.&lt;ref name="Housekeeping chp6"&gt;{{cite book|last =Lloyd|first =Helen| last2 =Lithgow|first2 =Katy |title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =6: Physical Agents of Deterioration|page =62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dust is [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]], meaning it is able to attract and hold water molecules creating an ideal climate for [[mold]] spores to grow and cause biological damage.&lt;ref name="Winterthur chp1"&gt;{{cite book|last =Landrey|first =Gregory|last2=Hoag|first2=Robert|title =The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collections|place =Hanover|publisher =University Press of New England|year =2000|chapter =1:General Care|page =13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hygroscopic trait can also prompt chemical reactions on a surface, especially upon metals. Inorganic dust particles may have tough sharp edges which can cause a number of types of damage from tearing fibers to [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrading]] softer surfaces if not properly removed. Wiping a clean cloth over a surface dusty with these inorganic particles may result in irreversible abrasions.

The best way to prevent damage from dust is to control and prevent substantial buildup of dust in the first place. This can be done by using air filters in the heating and air conditioning systems as well as using vacuum cleaners equipped with [[HEPA]] filters when possible. Limiting the amount of exposed surface areas of collections can also prevent dust from settling on objects. This can be done by storing objects in acid-free boxes, object specific enclosures, in drawers or covering open shelves with a [[polyethylene]] sheet.&lt;ref name="Concerns"&gt;{{cite book|last =Bachmann|first =Konstanze|title =Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =Smithsonian Books|year =1992|chapter =Principles of Storage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winterthur chp1"/&gt;

==Storage and Upkeep==
Maintaining a clean and orderly spaces ensures not only ease of accessibility but also the safety of the collections and those who work with them.

===Organization===
[[File:Archival collection.JPG|thumbnail|Example of two "layers;" the boxes and the shelves they rest upon]]
It is essential that collections have an organizational system to store and house objects. The system may be grounded in relations to size, material, cultural or historical grouping as it makes sense to the collection.&lt;ref name="Concerns"&gt;{{cite book|last =Bachmann|first =Konstanze|title =Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =Smithsonian Books|year =1992|chapter =Principles of Storage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp7"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 7: Museum Collections Storage|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP7.pdf|accessdate= April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structured organizational systems make identifying object locations straightforward and consistent which will help locating and returning an object to its proper space.

Part of a system is the use of “successive layers of protective envelopes and enclosures.” &lt;ref name="NPS,Chp7"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 7: Museum Collections Storage|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP7.pdf|accessdate= April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of “layers” include nearly everything from storage spaces, padded shelves, non-acidic archival boxes and individual packaging. Each new layer should provide further protection by creating a microclimate buffer between an object and environmental fluctuations, light, dust and pollutants.

===Housekeeping===
Keeping spaces clean and clear of debris is crucial to the preservation of object in several ways. Primarily it ensures that objects don’t become over exposed to detrimental agents like dust, but it also ensures that the areas are safe for people and objects to move within, unobstructed by potential hazards. Tasks that fall under this purview include routine inspection and dusting of work areas and objects, and general cleaning of work areas. Spaces and objects should be monitored and inspected regularly to ensure that any problem is caught and resolved quickly or note any condition change.&lt;ref name="Housekeeping chp12"&gt;{{cite book|last =Lloyd|first =Helen| last2 =Lithgow|first2 =Katy |title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =12: Housekeeping Tasks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regularity of dusting and cleaning will differ institution to institution, and will depend upon factors like foot-traffic, how well the space is sealed off from the outside, and how long it takes for dust to build up. As a general rule, work areas should be cleaned frequently, storage areas and furniture less so, and objects dusted occasionally and only after consulting a conservator.&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp13"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 13: Museum Housekeeping|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP13.pdf |accessdate= April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inside work areas, floors should be swept or vacuumed and work surfaces should be cleared off and dusted. Storage areas probably need less frequent attention, but should still have the floors cleaned and exposed surfaces of storage furniture like shelves wiped down. Objects themselves may sometimes need dusting if they are not boxed or wrapped up. Prior to dusting an object, the condition and stability needs to be considered, and a conservator should be consulted before any attempt is made. Research should also be done into how best to clean a particular type of medium or object.&lt;ref name="Housekeeping chp12"&gt;{{cite book|last =Lloyd|first =Helen| last2 =Lithgow|first2 =Katy |title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =12: Housekeeping Tasks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Comedy]] may be divided into multiple [[genres]] based on the source of humor, the method of delivery, and the context in which it is delivered.

These classifications overlap, and most [[comedians]] can fit into multiple genres. For example, [[deadpan]] comics often fall into observational boom comedy, or into black comedy or blue comedy to contrast the morbidity, or offensiveness of the joke with a lack of emotion.

This article contains a list with [[Gratis versus Libre|gratis]] (but not necessarily [[Open-source software|open source]]) [[satellite navigation]] (or "[[Global Positioning System|GPS]]") software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgpsmapper.com/buy.htm |title=Welcome cgpsmapper.com - Hostmonster.com |website=Cgpsmapper.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chaeron.com/gps.html#software |title=Chaeron Corporation - GPS (Global Position System) Solutions |website=Chaeron.com |date=2006-05-03 |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a range of devices (PC, laptop, tablet PC, mobile phone, handheld PC (Pocket PC, Palm)). Some of the free software mentioned here does not have detailed maps (or maps at all) or the ability to follow streets or type in street names (no [[geocoding]]). However, in many cases, it is also that which makes the program free (and sometimes open source&lt;ref&gt;Having open-source GPS programs available for different devices also allows people to expand on this software for certain projects, like automated or semi-automated steering systems for vehicles&lt;/ref&gt;), avoid the need of an Internet connection,&lt;ref&gt;Programs like Google maps require an internet connection as the maps are not available offline, in part because this would also make the program very large in filesize&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/591/how-to-use-gps-maps-without-an-internet-connection |title=offline - How to use GPS/Maps without an Internet connection? - Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange |website=Android.stackexchange.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Levi |url=http://pocketnow.com/2013/07/22/google-maps-offline |title=Here's how to take your Google Maps offline after the v7 update |website=Pocketnow.com |date=2013-07-22 |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and make it very lightweight (allowing use on small portable devices, including smartphones). Very basic programs like this may not be suitable for road navigation in cars, but serve their purpose for navigation while walking or trekking, and for use at sea. To determine the GPS coordinates of a destination, one can use sites such as [https://www.gpscoordinates.eu/ GPScoordinates.eu] and [http://www.gpsvisualizer.com GPS visualizer].

Some software presented here is free, but maps may need to be paid for. In this instance, and in the instance that some maps (of specific countries) are not standardly available, Mobile Atlas Creator (MOBAC) can be used (e.g. on OruxMaps, Maverick, Sports Tracker, Maplorer).

Some of the software mentioned can also be run on different devices than what they are intended for. A particular case-in-point is the Android software which can often [[Android (operating system)#Platform usage|be run on laptops or PCs]] (running [[Linux]], [[Windows]] or [[Mac OS X]]) as well. This can be done using emulators.

Some of the software mentioned here may run only on devices that are no longer commercially sold (such as the PalmPilot and PocketPC devices). However, these devices are often still obtainable via second-hand websites.

== Navigation software ==

=== Free maps ===
Navigation software with free maps often uses maps from the [[OpenStreetMap]] project.

[[File:Los Millares recreacion cuadro.jpg|thumb|Painting of a Copper Age walled settlement, [[Los Millares]], [[Iberia]]]]
The [[Chalcolithic]] or Copper Age is the transitional period between the [[Neolithic]] and the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name="OED-Chalcolithic"&gt;The New Oxford Dictionary of English (1998) {{ISBN|0-19-861263-X}}, p. 301: "'''Chalcolithic''' /,kælkəl'lɪθɪk/ '''adjective''' ''Archaeology'' of, relating to, or denoting a period in the 4th and 3rd millennium BCE, chiefly in the Near East and SE Europe, during which some weapons and tools were made of copper. This period was still largely Neolithic in character. Also called '''Eneolithic'''... Also called '''Copper Age''' - ''Origin'' early 20th cent.: from Greek ''khalkos'' 'copper' + ''lithos'' 'stone' + '''-ic'''".&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is taken to begin around the mid-[[5th millennium BC]], and ends with the beginning of the Bronze Age proper, in the late 4th to 3rd millennium BC, depending on the region.

The Chalcolithic is part of [[prehistory]], but based on archaeological evidence, the emergence of the first [[state (polity)|state societies]] can be inferred, notably in the [[Fertile Crescent]] ([[Sumer]], [[predynastic Egypt]], [[Minoan chronology|Protominoan Crete]]), with late Neolithic societies of comparable complexity emerging in the [[Indus Valley]] ([[Mehrgarh]]) and in [[Neolithic China|China]].

The development of [[state (polity)|states]]—large-scale, populous, politically centralized, and socially stratified polities/societies governed by powerful rulers—marks one of the major milestones in the evolution of human societies. Archaeologists often distinguish between primary (or pristine) states and secondary states. Primary states evolved independently through largely internal developmental processes rather than through the influence of any other pre-existing state. 

The earliest known [[State formation#Early state formation|primary states]] appeared in [[Mesopotamia]] c. 3700 BC,{{cn|date=October 2018}} in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] c. 3300 BC,{{cn|date=October 2018}} 
in the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] c. 3300 BC,{{cn|date=October 2018}}
and in [[Ancient China|China]] c. 1600 BC.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

&lt;!-- [[Image:Dajare love.jpg|thumb|[[East Japan Railway Company|JR East]] using ''dajare'' in a winter promotion]]--&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Dajare'''|[[wikt:駄洒落|駄洒落]]||"wordplay"}} is a kind of comic [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[word play]], similar in spirit to a [[pun]] that relies on similarities in the pronunciation of words to create a simple [[joke]].

''Dajare'' are popular in advertising. ''Dajare'' are also associated with {{nihongo|'''oyaji gags'''|親父ギャグ|oyaji gyagu}}, ''oyaji'' meaning "old man", as an "old man" would be considered by the younger generation most likely to attempt ''dajare'', making them a near equivalent of what would be called "[[dad joke]]s" in English.

==Examples==

===With one speaker===
'''Example one:'''
* アルミ缶の上にあるみかん ('''''arumi kan''' no ue ni '''aru mikan''''')
: '''Translation:'''
: A tangerine on an aluminum can.
: '''Explanation:'''
: アルミ (''arumi'') means "aluminum", 缶 (''kan'') means "a can", so ''arumi kan'' means "an aluminum can". Also ある (aru) means "exists" and みかん (''[[mikan]]'') means "a tangerine (mandarin orange)".

'''Example two:'''
* ウランは売らん ('''''uran''' wa '''uran''''')
: '''Translation:'''
: I never sell uranium.
: '''Explanation:'''
: ウラン (''uran'') means uranium, and the second 売らん (''uran'') means "never sell".

'''Example three:'''
* ニューヨークで入浴 ('''''nyūyōku''' de '''nyūyoku''''')
: '''Translation:'''
: Taking a bath in New York.
: '''Explanation:'''
: ニューヨーク (''nyūyōku'') means [[New York City|New York]], 入浴 (''nyūyoku'') means taking a bath.

'''Example four:'''
* レモンの入れもん ('''''remon''' no i'''remon''''')
: '''Translation:'''
: A container for a lemon
: '''Explanation:'''
: レモン (''remon'') means "a lemon", 入れもん (''iremon'') means "a container".

===With two speakers===
'''Example one:'''
: A: 大食いのたけし君も、宇宙ではあまり物を食べられないよ。 (''ōgui no takeshi kun mo, uchū dewa amari mono o taberarenaiyo'')
: B: なぜ? (''naze'')
: A: 宇宙には空気(食う気)がない。 (''uchū niwa kūki ga nai'')
: '''Translation:'''
: A: In space, even a glutton like Takeshi can't eat anything.
: B: Why's that?
: A: In space, he has no appetite.
: '''Explanation:'''
: ''Kūki'' (くうき) can mean either "air" (空気) or "will to eat" (食う気), thus what sounds like a perfectly reasonable statement &amp;ndash; "in space there is no air"  &amp;ndash; takes on a much stronger meaning when said in context.

'''Example two:'''&lt;br&gt;
: A: 向こうの通りにヘイができたんだってね。(''mukou no tōri ni '''hei''' ga dekitan datte ne'')
: B: へぇー。(''hee...'')
: '''Translation:'''
: A: I hear they finished the wall on the street over there.
: B: Well!
: '''Explanation:'''
: The word for "fence" or "wall" here (塀, ''hei'') sounds very similar to the Japanese [[interjection]] ''hee'' (へえ, similar in usage to the phrases "oh yeah?" and "well!"), thus the answer sounds like a repeat of the information in the initial statement.
: Another version of this same joke replaces ''hei'' with ''kakoi'' (囲い), which sounds similar to a word meaning something like "cool" or "looks good" (かっこいい).

===Children's dajare (with one speaker)===
There are also some jokes mostly used by children that resemble ''dajare''. These are also considered jokes that "everybody knows" in most parts of Japan.  These are examples of ''ginatayomi'' (ぎなた読み), which relies on ambiguity in where one word ends and another begins.

'''Example one:'''&lt;br&gt;
: A: パンつくった事ある？ (''pan tsukutta koto aru?'')
: '''Translation:'''
: A: Have you ever made bread before?
: '''Can also be interpreted as:'''
: A: Have you ever eaten underpants before? (パンツ食った事ある？, ''pantsu kutta koto aru?'')

'''Example two:'''&lt;br&gt;
: A: ねぇ、ちゃんとお風呂入ってる？ (''nee, chanto ofuro haitteru?'')
: '''Translation:'''
: A: Hey, have you been taking a bath (regularly)?
'''Can also be interpreted as:'''&lt;br&gt;
: A: Do you take baths with your (older) sister? (姉ちゃんとお風呂入ってる？, ''nee-chan to ofuro haitteru?''; the casual ''nee'' combined with the adverb ''chanto'' sounds the same as ''nee-chan to'' meaning "with your (older) sister".)

'''''Dogzilla''''' is a children's [[picture book]] created by [[Dav Pilkey]] that parodies ''[[Godzilla]]'' with a [[Cardigan Welsh Corgi]]. Harcourt, Inc. published this title in 1993. “The illustrations in this book are manipulated photographic collage, heavily retouched with acrylic paint.”&lt;ref name="Pilkey, Dav 1993"&gt;Pilkey, Dav. Dogzilla. 1st. San Diego, CA: Harcourt, Inc., 1993. Print. {{ISBN|0-15-204948-7}}, 0-15-204949-5 (pb).&lt;/ref&gt; The photographs of the animals are of Pilkey’s own pets: Flash starring as the Big Cheese, Rabies as Professor Scarlett O’Hairy, Dwayne as the Soldier Guy, and Leia as the Monster. Dogzilla is dedicated to John “The Rapper” Wills and the book has been [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rated EG]], meaning “Extremely Goofy.” A companion title is Dav Pilkey’s ''[[Kat Kong]]'' which spoofs [[King Kong]].

==Plot summary==
“It’s time for Mousopolis’s First Annual Barbecue Cook-Off. But just when the fun is about to begin, the irresistible aroma of barbecue sauce awakens the most frightening creature known to mousekind: the dreaded Dogzilla. As her horrible doggy breath fills the streets, the residents of Mousopolis must run for their lives. Can they get rid of that big stinky dog before it’s too late?” &lt;ref name="Pilkey, Dav 1993"/&gt;

==Inspiration for Dogzilla==
"The inspiration for ''Dogzilla'' came one day when I was at a friend's house watching one of my favorite movies, ''[[Godzilla vs. Megalon]]''. My friend's son, Nate, was sitting on the floor building a castle out of [[Lego]]. Everything was fine until Nate let his dog, Leia, into the house. Leia came charging into the room and smashed right through the Lego castle. With the mass of little Lego blocks and action figures scattered around her, Leia looked like a silly monster who had just rampaged a city. 'I should write a book about that,' I said. So I did." — Dav Pilkey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pilkey.com/bookview.php?id%3D2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103143650/http://pilkey.com/bookview.php?id=2 |archivedate=2010-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Elgin Marbles''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|l|ɡ|ɪ|n}}), also known as the '''Parthenon Marbles''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Γλυπτά του Παρθενώνα), are a collection of [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] [[marble sculpture]]s made under the supervision of the architect and sculptor [[Phidias]] and his assistants. They were originally part of the [[Parthenon|temple of the Parthenon]] and other buildings on the [[Acropolis of Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/w/what_are_the_elgin_marbles.aspx|title=What are the 'Elgin Marbles'?|publisher=britishmuseum.org|accessdate=2009-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420232511/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/w/what_are_the_elgin_marbles.aspx|archive-date=20 April 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Elgin-Marbles|title=Elgin Marbles&amp;nbsp;– Greek sculpture |work= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | accessdate = 2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1801 to 1812, agents of [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin]] removed about half of the surviving sculptures of the Parthenon, as well as sculptures from the [[Propylaea]] and [[Erechtheum]].&lt;ref name=BritB&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Elgin Marbles, 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; The Marbles were transported by sea to Britain.

After [[Greek War of Independence|gaining its independence]] from the Ottoman Empire in 1832, the newly found Greek state began a series of projects to restore its monuments and retrieve looted art. It has expressed its disapproval of Elgin's removal of the Marbles from the Acropolis and the Parthenon,&lt;ref name="Ministry of Culture: The Background of the Removal"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://odysseus.culture.gr/a/1/12/ga125.html |title=The Background of the Removal |publisher=Greek Ministry of Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is regarded as one of the world's greatest cultural monuments.&lt;ref name="UNESCO: Acropolis, Athens"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/404 |title=Acropolis, Athens |publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; International efforts to repatriate the Marbles to Greece were intensified in the 1980s by then Greek Minister of Culture [[Melina Mercouri]], and there are now many organisations actively campaigning for the Marbles' return, several united as part of the [[International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]]. The [[Greek government]] itself continues to urge the return of the marbles to [[Athens]] so as to be unified with the remaining marbles and for the complete [[Parthenon Frieze|Parthenon frieze sequence]] to be restored, through diplomatic, political and legal means.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-greece-marbles/greece-wants-parthenon-marbles-back-tsipras-tells-may-idUSKBN1JM2T6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[UNESCO]] offered to mediate between Greece and the [[United Kingdom]] to resolve the dispute, although this was later turned down by the British Museum on the basis that UNESCO works with government bodies, not trustees of museums.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Letter to British Government for the return of Parthenon's Marbles"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iemc-unesco.org/unesco-letter-to-british-government-for-the-return-of-parthenons-marbles/ |title=UNESCO Letter to British Government for the return of Parthenon's Marbles |publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK has not written back to UNESCO Letter"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CLT/19_ICPRCP_Recommendations_en_final.pdf |title=UK has not written back to UNESCO Letter |publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elgin Marbles: UK declines mediation over Parthenon sculptures|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32204548|website=BBC News|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1798 the Earl of Elgin was appointed as "Ambassador Extraordinary and [[Plenipotentiary|Minister Plenipotentiary]] of His Britannic Majesty to the Sublime Porte of [[Selim III]], Sultan of Turkey" (Greece was then [[Ottoman Greece|part of the Ottoman Empire]]). Before his departure to take up the post he had approached officials of the British government to inquire if they would be interested in employing artists to take casts and drawings of the sculptured portions of the Parthenon. According to Lord Elgin, "the answer of the Government&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;was entirely negative."&lt;ref name="Casey" /&gt;

Lord Elgin decided to carry out the work himself, and employed artists to take casts and drawings under the supervision of the [[Parthenopaean Republic|Neapolitan]] court painter, [[Giovanni Battista Lusieri|Giovani Lusieri]].&lt;ref name="Casey" /&gt; According to a Turkish local, [[marble]] sculptures that fell were being burned to obtain [[lime (material)|lime]] for building.&lt;ref name="Casey" /&gt; Although his original intention was only to document the sculptures, in 1801 Lord Elgin began to remove material from the Parthenon and its surrounding structures&lt;ref name="guardian faq"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/jul/21/highereducation.parthenon |title=Elgin Marbles: fact or fiction? |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2004-07-21|accessdate=2009-06-25 | location=London | first=Dorothy | last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the supervision of Lusieri. Pieces were also removed from the [[Erechtheion]], the [[Propylaia]], and the [[Temple of Athena Nike]], all inside the [[Acropolis]].

The excavation and removal was completed in 1812 at a personal cost to Elgin of around £70,000.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/184554/Elgin-Marbles |title=Elgin Marbles |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date= |accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elgin intended to use the marbles to decorate [[Broomhall House]], his private home near [[Dunfermline]] in Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/19/books/books-of-the-times-refueling-the-elgin-marbles-debate.html&lt;/ref&gt; but a costly divorce suit forced him to sell them to settle his debts.&lt;ref&gt;As reported by John E. Simmons in: [https://web.archive.org/web/20170109104920/https://books.google.com/books?id=wCFsDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT167&amp;lpg=PT167&amp;dq= Museums: A History], chapter 7, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 07.07.2016 - 326 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Elgin sold the Parthenon Marbles to the British government for less than it cost him to procure them, declining higher offers from other potential buyers, including [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt;

==Description==
{{Main article|Parthenon Frieze|Metopes of the Parthenon}}
The Parthenon Marbles acquired by Elgin include some 21 figures from the statuary from the east and west [[pediment]]s, 15 of an original 92 [[Metope (architecture)|metope]] panels depicting battles between the [[Lapiths]] and the [[Centaur]]s, as well as 75 meters of the [[Parthenon Frieze]] which decorated the horizontal course set above the interior architrave of the temple. As such, they represent more than half of what now remains of the surviving sculptural decoration of the Parthenon.

Elgin's acquisitions also included objects from other buildings on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Athenian Acropolis]]: a [[Caryatid]] from [[Erechtheum]]; four slabs from the parapet frieze of the [[Temple of Athena Nike]]; and a number of other [[Architecture|architectural]] fragments of the Parthenon, Propylaia, Erechtheum, the Temple of Athene Nike, and the [[Treasury of Atreus]].

==Legality of the removal from Athens==
The Acropolis was at that time an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] military fort, so Elgin required special permission to enter the site, the Parthenon, and the surrounding buildings. He stated that he had obtained a [[firman (decree)|firman]] from the [[Sultan]] which allowed his artists to access the site, but he was unable to produce the original documentation. However, Elgin presented a document claimed to be an English translation of an [[Italian language|Italian]] copy made at the time. This document is now kept in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;St Clair, William: Lord Elgin and the Marbles. Oxford University Press, USA, 3 edition (17 July 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Its authenticity has been questioned, as it lacked the formalities characterising edicts from the sultan. Vassilis Demetriades, Professor of Turkish Studies at the University of Crete, has argued that "any expert in Ottoman diplomatic language can easily ascertain that the original of the document which has survived was not a firman".&lt;ref name=firman/&gt; The document was recorded in an appendix of an 1816 parliamentary committee report. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NwUFAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PR1&amp;ots=GiMElOqrbf&amp;dq=lord%20elgin%20testified%201816%20british%20parliamentary%20committee&amp;hl=el&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q=lord%20elgin%20testified%201816%20british%20parliamentary%20committee&amp;f=false  'The committee permission'] had convened to examine a request by Elgin asking the British government to purchase the Marbles. The report said that the document&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parthenon.newmentor.net/firman.htm|title=firman|work=newmentor.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the appendix was an accurate translation, in English, of an Ottoman firman dated July 1801. In Elgin's view it amounted to an Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles. The committee was told that the original document was given to Ottoman officials in Athens in 1801. Researchers have so far failed to locate it despite the fact that the Ottoman archives in Istanbul still hold a number of similar documents dating from the same period.&lt;ref name=Nation/&gt;

The parliamentary record shows that the Italian copy of the firman was not presented to the committee by Elgin himself but by one of his associates, the clergyman Rev. [[Philip Hunt (priest)|Philip Hunt]]. Hunt, who at the time resided in Bedford, was the last witness to appear before the committee and stated that he had in his possession an Italian translation of the Ottoman original. He went on to explain that he had not brought the document, because, upon leaving Bedford, he was not aware that he was to testify as a witness. The English document in the parliamentary report was filed by Hunt, but the committee was not presented with the Italian translation in Hunt's possession. William St. Clair, a contemporary biographer of Lord Elgin, said he possessed Hunt's Italian document and "vouches for the accuracy of the English translation". The committee report states on page 69 "(Signed with a signet.) Seged Abdullah Kaimacan" - however, the document presented to the committee was "an English translation of this purported translation into Italian of the original ''firman''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kate Fitz |last=Gibbon |title=Who Owns the Past?: Cultural Policy, Cultural Property, and the Law |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2005 |pages=115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had neither signet nor signature on it, a fact corroborated by St. Clair.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Rudenstine |title=Did Elgin cheat the Marbles? |journal=[[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1967 study by British historian William St. Clair, ''Lord Elgin and the Marbles,'' stated the sultan did not allow the removal of statues and reliefs from the Parthenon. The study judged a clause authorizing the British to take stones “with old inscriptions and figures” probably meant items in the excavations the site, not the art decorating the temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2017/03-04/parthenon-sculptures-british-museum-controversy/?sf72336468=1|title=How the Parthenon Lost Its Marbles|date=2017-03-28|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document allowed Elgin and his team to erect scaffolding so as to make drawings and mouldings in [[chalk]] or [[gypsum]], as well as to measure the remains of the ruined buildings and excavate the foundations which may have become covered in the [''ghiaja'' (meaning gravel, debris)]; and "...that when they wish to take away [''qualche'' (meaning 'some' or 'a few')] pieces of stone with old inscriptions or figures thereon, that no opposition be made thereto". The interpretation of these lines has been questioned even by non-restitutionalists,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal |first=John Henry |last=Merryman |title=Thinking about the Elgin Marbles |journal=[[Michigan Law Review]] |volume=83 |issue=8 |year=1985 |pages=1898–1899 |doi=10.2307/1288954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;English translation of the firman {{cite web|url=http://www.greece.org/parthenon/marbles/firman.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510201851/http://www.greece.org/parthenon/marbles/firman.htm |archivedate=10 May 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the word ''qualche'', which in modern language should be translated as ''a few'' but can also mean ''any''. According to non-restitutionalists, further evidence that the removal of the sculptures by Elgin was approved by the Ottoman authorities is shown by a second firman which was required for the shipping of the marbles from the Piraeus.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite book |first=John Henry |last=Merryman |chapter=Whither the Elgin Marbles? |title=Imperialism, Art And Restitution |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have questioned the legality of Elgin's actions, including the legitimacy of the documentation purportedly authorising them. A study by Professor [[David Rudenstine]] of the [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]] concluded that the premise that Elgin obtained legal title to the marbles, which he then transferred to the British government, "is certainly not established and may well be false".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rudenstine |first=David |title=The Legality of Elgin's Taking: A Review Essay of Four Books on the Parthenon Marbles |journal=International Journal of Cultural Property |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=356–376 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudenstine's argumentation is partly based on a translation discrepancy he noticed between the surviving Italian document and the English text submitted by Hunt to the parliamentary committee. The text from the committee report reads "We therefore have written this Letter to you, and expedited it by Mr. Philip Hunt, an English Gentleman, Secretary of the aforesaid Ambassador" but according to the St. Clair Italian document the actual wording is "We therefore have written this letter to you and expedited it by N.N.". In Rudenstine's view, this substitution of "Mr. Philip Hunt" with the initials "N.N." can hardly be a simple mistake. He further argues that the document was presented after the committee's insistence that some form of Ottoman written authorisation for the removal of the marbles be provided, a fact known to Hunt by the time he testified. Thus, according to Rudenstine, "Hunt put himself in a position in which he could simultaneously vouch for the authenticity of the document and explain why he alone had a copy of it fifteen years after he surrendered the original to Ottoman officials in Athens". On two earlier occasions, Elgin stated that the Ottomans gave him written permissions more than once, but that he had "retained none of them." Hunt testified on March 13, and one of the questions asked was "Did you ever see any of the written permissions which were granted to [Lord Elgin] for removing the Marbles from the Temple of Minerva?" to which Hunt answered "yes", adding that he possessed an Italian translation of the original firman. Nonetheless, he did not explain why he had retained the translation for 15 years, whereas Elgin, who had testified two weeks earlier, knew nothing about the existence of any such document.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt;

English travel writer [[Edward Daniel Clarke]], an eyewitness, wrote that the [[Dizdar]], the Ottoman fortress commander on the scene, attempted to stop the removal of the metopes but was bribed to allow it to continue.&lt;ref name="Edward Daniel Clarke 1818 223ff"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Edward Daniel Clarke |title= Travels in various Countries of Europe, Asia and Africa Part the Second Greece Egypt and the Holy Land Section the Second Fourth Edition Volume the Sixth |publisher=T. Cadell |location=London |year=1818 |page= 223ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In contrast, John Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law at [[Stanford Law School]] and also Professor of Art at [[Stanford University]], putting aside the discrepancy presented by Rudenstine, argues that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognisable. The Ottoman [[sultan]] was grateful to the British for repelling [[Napoleon]]ic expansion, and the Parthenon marbles had no sentimental value to him.&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt; Further, that written permission exists in the form of the firman, which is the most formal kind of permission available from that government, and that Elgin had further permission to export the marbles, legalises his (and therefore the British Museum's) claim to the Marbles.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt; He does note, though, that the clause concerning the extent of Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles "is at best ambiguous", adding that the document "provides slender authority for the massive removals from the Parthenon&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;The reference to 'taking away any pieces of stone' seems incidental, intended to apply to objects found while excavating. That was certainly the interpretation privately placed on the firman by several of the Elgin party, including Lady Elgin. Publicly, however, a different attitude was taken, and the work of dismantling the sculptures on the Parthenon and packing them for shipment to England began in earnest. In the process, Elgin's party damaged the structure, leaving the Parthenon not only denuded of its sculptures but further ruined by the process of removal. It is certainly arguable that Elgin exceeded the authority granted in the firman in both respects".&lt;ref name="NafzigerPaterson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James A. R.

The issue of firmans of this nature, along with universally required bribes, was not unusual at this time: In 1801 for example, [[Edward Daniel Clarke|Edward Clarke]] and his assistant Cripps, obtained an authorisation from the governor of Athens for the removal of a statue of the goddess [[Demeter]] which was at [[Eleusis]], with the intervention of Italian artist [[Giovanni Battista Lusieri]] who was Lord Elgin's assistant at the time.&lt;ref name="Fagan2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Fagan|title=From Stonehenge to Samarkand: An Anthology of Archaeological Travel Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-f-24-8negC&amp;pg=PA54|date=20 July 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-516091-8|page=54|quote=Clarke and Cripps greatly admired the statue, which weighed over 2 tons (1.8 tonnes) and decided to take it to England.

==Contemporary reaction{{anchor | Criticism by Elgin's contemporaries}}==
[[File:Temporary Elgin Room at the Museum in 1819.jpg|thumb|300px|A portrait depicting the Elgin Marbles in a temporary Elgin Room at the [[British Museum]] surrounded by museum staff, a trustee and visitors, 1819]]
When the marbles were shipped to England, they were "an instant success among many"&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt; who admired the sculptures and supported their arrival, but both the sculptures and Elgin also received criticism from detractors. Lord Elgin began negotiations for the sale of the collection to the British Museum in 1811, but negotiations failed despite the support of British artists&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt; after the government showed little interest. Many Britons opposed purchase of the statues because they were in bad condition and therefore did not display the "ideal beauty" found in other sculpture collections.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;  The following years marked an increased interest in classical Greece, and in June 1816, after parliamentary hearings, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] offered £35,000 in exchange for the sculptures. Even at the time the acquisition inspired much debate, although it was supported by "many persuasive calls" for the purchase.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;

[[Lord Byron]] strongly objected to the removal of the marbles from [[Greece]], denouncing Elgin as a vandal.&lt;ref name=BritA/&gt; His point of view about the removal of the Marbles from Athens is also mentioned in his narrative poem ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'', published in 1812, which itself was largely inspired by Byron's travels around the Mediterranean and the [[Aegean Sea]] between 1809 and 1811:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elginism.com/20040720/90/ |title=The story of the Elgin Marbles
|publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=2004-07-14 |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Dull is the eye that will not weep to see
:Thy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed
:By British hands, which it had best behoved
:To guard those relics ne'er to be restored.
:Curst be the hour when from their isle they roved,
:And once again thy hapless bosom gored,
:And snatch'd thy shrinking gods to northern climes abhorred!

Byron was not the only one to protest against the removal at the time:
:"The Honourable Lord has taken advantage of the most unjustifiable means and has committed the most flagrant pillages. It was, it seems, fatal that a representative of our country loot those objects that the Turks and other barbarians had considered sacred," said [[Sir John Newport, 1st Baronet|Sir John Newport]].&lt;ref name="newsweek stones"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/200852 |title=Romancing the Stones |publisher=Newsweek |date= |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Daniel Clarke]] witnessed the removal of the metopes and called the action a "spoliation", writing that "thus the form of the temple has sustained a greater injury than it had already experienced from the Venetian artillery," and that "neither was there a workman employed in the undertaking ... who did not express his concern that such havoc should be deemed necessary, after moulds and casts had been already made of all the sculpture which it was designed to remove."&lt;ref name="Edward Daniel Clarke 1818 223ff"/&gt; When Sir [[Francis Ronalds]] visited Athens and [[Giovanni Battista Lusieri]] in 1820, he wrote that "If Lord Elgin had possessed real taste in lieu of a covetous spirit he would have done just the reverse of what he has, he would have removed the rubbish and left the antiquities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sirfrancisronalds.co.uk/athens.html|title=Sir Francis Ronalds' Travel Journal: Athens|website=Sir Francis Ronalds and his Family|access-date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A parliamentary committee investigating the situation concluded that the monuments were best given "asylum" under a "free government" such as the British one.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt; In 1810, Elgin published a defence of his actions,&lt;ref name=BritB/&gt; but the subject remained controversial.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}&lt;!-- Obviously they're controversial now, but citation needed that they remained controversial in Britain at that time.--&gt; [[John Keats]] viewed them in 1817 when they were exhibited in the British Museum, hence his famous [[sonnet]] about the marbles titled "On Seeing the Elgin Marbles". Notable supporters of Elgin included the painter [[Benjamin Robert Haydon]].&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;

A public debate in Parliament followed Elgin's publication, and Parliament again exonerated Elgin's actions. Parliament decided to purchase the marbles for the "British nation" in 1816 by a vote of 82–30 for £35,000.&lt;ref name=BritA/&gt; They were deposited in the British Museum, where they were displayed in the Elgin Saloon (constructed in 1832), until the [[Duveen Gallery]] was completed in 1939. Crowds packed the British Museum to view the sculptures, setting attendance records for the museum.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt; [[William Wordsworth]] viewed the marbles at the museum and commented favourably on their aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=William Wordsworth |title=The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth |publisher=W.

==Damage==

===Morosini===
[[File:Elgin Marbles east pediment.jpg|thumb|East Pediment]]
Prior damage to the marbles was sustained during successive wars, and it was during such conflicts that the Parthenon and its artwork sustained, by far, the most extensive damage. In particular, an explosion ignited by [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]] gun and cannon-fire bombardment in 1687, whilst the Parthenon was used as a munitions store during the [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman rule]], destroyed or damaged many pieces of Parthenon art, including some of that later taken by Lord Elgin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/Archaeopaedia/198 |title=Stanford Archaeopedia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314025855/http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/Archaeopaedia/198 |archivedate=14 March 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this explosion that sent the marble roof, most of the [[cella]] walls, 14 columns from the north and south [[peristyle]]s, and carved metopes and frieze blocks flying and crashing to the ground, destroying much of the artwork. Further damage to the Parthenon's artwork occurred when the Venetian general [[Francesco Morosini]] looted the site of its larger sculptures. The tackle he was using to remove the sculptures proved to be faulty and snapped, dropping an over-life-sized sculpture of [[Poseidon]] and the horses of [[Athena]]'s chariot from the west pediment on to the rock of the Acropolis {{convert|40|ft}} below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521820936&amp;ss=exc|title=The Parthenon|work=cambridge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of Independence===
The [[Erechtheion]] was used as a munitions store by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] during the [[Greek War of Independence]]&lt;ref name=Erechtheion&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=2384 |title=History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203021650/http://www.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=2384 |archivedate=3 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1821–1833) which ended the 355-year Ottoman rule of Athens. The Acropolis was besieged twice during the war, first [[Siege of the Acropolis (1821–22)|by the Greeks]] in 1821–22 and then [[Siege of the Acropolis (1826–27)|by the Ottoman forces]] in 1826–27. During the first siege the besieged Ottoman forces attempted to melt the lead in the columns to cast bullets, even prompting the Greeks to offer their own bullets to the Ottomans in order to minimize damage.&lt;ref name=Hitchens&gt;Hitchens Christopher, ''The Elgin Marbles: Should They Be Returned to Greece?'', 1998, p.viii, {{ISBN|1-85984-220-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elgin===
Elgin consulted with Italian sculptor [[Antonio Canova]] in 1803 about how best to restore the marbles. Canova was considered by some to be the world's best sculptural restorer of the time; Elgin wrote that Canova declined to work on the marbles for fear of damaging them further.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;

To facilitate transport by Elgin, the columns' capitals and many metopes and frieze slabs were either hacked off the main structure or sawn and sliced into smaller sections, causing irreparable damage to the Parthenon itself.&lt;ref name="Greek Ministry of Culture: Memorandum on the Parthenon Marbles"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yppo.gr/4/marm/memorandum-gr.pdf |title=Greek Government's Memorandum |publisher=Greek Ministry of Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/arts/design/28ouro.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin Where Gods Yearn for Long-Lost Treasures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016235933/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/arts/design/28ouro.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin |date=16 October 2015 }}, ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; One shipload of marbles on board the British brig ''Mentor'' &lt;ref name="The Wreck of the Mentor on the Coast of the Island of Kythera and the Operation to Retrieve, Salvage, and Transport the Parthenon Sculptures to London"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/376886/_The_Wreck_of_the_Mentor_on_the_Coast_of_the_Island_of_Kythera_and_the_Operation_to_Retrieve_Salvage_and_Transport_the_Parthenon_Sculptures_to_London_1802-1805_ |title=The Wreck of the Mentor on the Coast of the Island of Kythera and the Operation to Retrieve, Salvage, and Transport the Parthenon Sculptures to London (1802-1805) |publisher=Arts Books, Athens}}&lt;/ref&gt; was caught in a storm off [[Cape Matapan]] in southern Greece and sank near [[Kythera]], but was salvaged at the Earl's personal expense;&lt;ref name="British Museum releases"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press_releases/statements/parthenon_sculptures/parthenon_-_facts_and_figures.aspx |title=The Parthenon Sculptures |publisher=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; it took two years to bring them to the surface.

The artefacts held in London suffered from 19th-century pollution which persisted until the mid-20th century and have suffered irreparable damage by previous cleaning methods employed by British Museum staff.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Oddy|Oddy, Andrew]], "The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975", in ''Studies in Conservation'', vol. 47, no.3, (2002), p.145–146, Quote: "However, for a short time in the late 1930s copper scrapers were used to remove areas of discolouration from the surface of the Elgin Marbles. New information is presented about this lamentable episode."&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1838, scientist [[Michael Faraday]] was asked to provide a solution to the problem of the deteriorating surface of the marbles. The outcome is described in the following excerpt from the letter he sent to Henry Milman, a commissioner for the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Oddy|Oddy, Andrew]], "The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975", in ''Studies in Conservation'', vol. 47, no.3, (2002), p.146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, I., '"Sir, they are scrubbing the Elgin Marbles!"&amp;nbsp;– some controversial cleanings of the Parthenon Sculptures', ''Minerva'' 10(6) (1999) 43-45.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The marbles generally were very dirty&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;from a deposit of dust and soot.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;I found the body of the marble beneath the surface white.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;The application of water, applied by a sponge or soft cloth, removed the coarsest dirt.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;The use of fine, gritty powder, with the water and rubbing, though it more quickly removed the upper dirt, left much embedded in the cellular surface of the marble. I then applied alkalies, both carbonated and caustic; these quickened the loosening of the surface dirt&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;but they fell far short of restoring the marble surface to its proper hue and state of cleanliness. I finally used dilute nitric acid, and even this failed.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;The examination has made me despair of the possibility of presenting the marbles in the British Museum in that state of purity and whiteness which they originally possessed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further effort to clean the marbles ensued in 1858. [[Richard Westmacott]], who was appointed superintendent of the "moving and cleaning the sculptures" in 1857, in a letter approved by the British Museum Standing Committee on 13 March 1858 concluded&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Oddy|Oddy, Andrew]], "The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975", in ''Studies in Conservation'', vol. 47, no.3, (2002), p.148&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think it my duty to say that some of the works are much damaged by ignorant or careless moulding&amp;nbsp;– with oil and lard&amp;nbsp;– and by restorations in wax and resin. These mistakes have caused discolouration. I shall endeavour to remedy this without, however, having recourse to any composition that can injure the surface of the marble.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Yet another effort to clean the marbles occurred in 1937–38. This time the incentive was provided by the construction of a new Gallery to house the collection. The Pentelic marble mined from [[Mount Pentelicus]] north of Athens, from which the sculptures are made, naturally acquires a tan colour similar to honey when exposed to air; this colouring is often known as the marble's "patina"&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Ernest Arthur: A Handbook of Greek Sculpture.

American archeologist [[Dorothy King]], in a newspaper article, wrote that techniques similar to the ones used in 1937–38 were applied by Greeks as well in more recent decades than the British, and maintained that Italians still find them acceptable.&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt; The British Museum said that a similar cleaning of the [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Athenian Agora]] was carried out by the conservation team of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;J. M. Cook and John Boardman, "Archaeology in Greece, 1953", The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 74, (1954), pp. 147&lt;/ref&gt; in 1953 using steel chisels and brass wire.&lt;ref name="British Museum releases"/&gt; According to the Greek ministry of Culture, the cleaning was carefully limited to surface salt crusts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; The 1953 American report concluded that the techniques applied were aimed at removing the black deposit formed by rain-water and "brought out the high technical quality of the carving" revealing at the same time "a few surviving particles of colour".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

Documents released by the British Museum under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] revealed that a series of minor accidents, thefts and acts of [[vandalism]] by visitors have inflicted further damage to the sculptures.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;Hastings, Chris.

==Relocation debate==

===Rationale for returning to Athens===

Those arguing for the Marbles' return claim legal, moral and artistic grounds. Their arguments include:

* The main stated aim of the Greek campaign is to reunite the Parthenon sculptures around the world in order to restore "organic elements" which "at present remain without cohesion, homogeneity and historicity of the monument to which they belong" and allow visitors to better appreciate them as a whole;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://odysseus.culture.gr/a/1/12/ea121.html |title=Hellenic Ministry of Culture, Special Issues |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017204203/http://odysseus.culture.gr/a/1/12/ea121.html |archivedate=17 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicoletta Divari-Valakou 2008"&gt;Nicoletta Divari-Valakou, (Director of the Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities of Athens), "Revisiting the Parthenon: National Heritage in the Age of Globalism" in Mille Gabriel &amp; Jens Dahl, (eds.)

* Presenting all the extant Parthenon Marbles in their original historical and cultural environment would permit their "fuller understanding and interpretation";&lt;ref name="Nicoletta Divari-Valakou 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Who owns the marbles? The debate hits Sydney"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sydney.edu.au/senate/documents/History/Elgin_marbles_articles.pdf |title=Debate of the Elgin Marbles |publisher=University of Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Precedents have been set with the return of fragments of the monument by [[Sweden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6138214.stm |title= Swede gives back Acropolis marble | work=[[BBC News Online]]  | date=2006-11-10 | accessdate=2010-01-03 | first=Malcolm | last=Brabant}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Heidelberg]], [[Germany]],&lt;ref name=CBC&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/09/05/parthenon-marbles.html |title=Greece reclaims Parthenon sculpture from Germany |work=CBC News |date=2006-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527154618/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/09/05/parthenon-marbles.html |archivedate=27 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles]]&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt; and the [[Holy See|Vatican]];&lt;ref name=VAT&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tanea.gr/default.asp?pid=2&amp;artid=1407815&amp;ct=4 |title=TA NEA On-line |publisher=Tanea.gr |accessdate=2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Returning the Parthenon sculptures (it should be noted that Greece is requesting only the return of sculptures from this particular building) would not set a precedent for other restitution claims because of the distinctively "universal value" of the Parthenon;&lt;ref&gt;Nicoletta Divari-Valakou, (Director of the Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities of Athens), "Revisiting the Parthenon: National Heritage in the Age of Globalism" in Mille Gabriel &amp; Jens Dahl, (eds.)

* Safekeeping of the marbles would be ensured at the New [[Acropolis Museum]], situated to the south of the Acropolis hill. It was built to hold the Parthenon sculpture in natural sunlight that characterises the Athenian climate, arranged in the same way as they would have been on the Parthenon. The museum's facilities have been equipped with state-of-the-art technology for the protection and preservation of exhibits;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcspace.com/architects/Tschumi/|title=Bernard Tschumi Architects|work=arcspace.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051614/http://www.arcspace.com/architects/Tschumi/|archivedate=28 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The friezes are part of a single work of art, thus it was unintended that fragments of this piece be scattered across different locations;
* Casts of the marbles would be just as able to demonstrate the cultural influences which Greek sculptures have had upon European art as would the original marbles, whereas the context with which the marbles belong cannot be replicated within the British museum;
* A poll suggested that more British people (37%) supported  the marbles' restoration to Greece than opposed it (23%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/10/18/british-people-tend-want-elgin-marbles-returned/|title=British people tend to want Elgin marbles returned|newspaper=Yougov.co.uk|date=18 October 2014|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationale for retaining in London===
A range of different arguments have been presented by scholars,&lt;ref name="newsweek stones"/&gt; British political leaders and British Museum spokespersons over the years in defence of retention of the Elgin Marbles by the British Museum. The main points include:
* the assertion that fulfilling all restitution claims would empty most of the world's great museums&amp;nbsp;– this has also caused concerns among other European and American museums, with one potential target being the [[Nefertiti Bust|famous bust of Nefertiti]] in [[Berlin]]'s [[Neues Museum]]; in addition, portions of Parthenon marbles are kept by many other European museums.&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt; Advocates of the British Museum's position also point out that the Marbles in Britain receive about 6 million visitors per year as opposed to 1.5 million visitors to the Acropolis Museum. The removal of the Marbles to Greece would therefore, they argue, significantly reduce the number of people who have the opportunity to visit the Marbles.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/comment/why-returning-the-elgin-marbles-would-be-madness/&lt;/ref&gt; The English Romantic poet John Keats, and the French sculptor Auguste Rodin, are notable examples of visitors to the Elgin Marbles after their removal to England who subsequently produced famous work inspired by them.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/elgin-marbles-british-museum-rodin-exhibition-uk-return-parthenon-greece-a8339661.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52305/on-seeing-the-elgin-marbles&lt;/ref&gt;
* the assertion that Greece could mount no court case, because Elgin claims to have been granted permission by what was then Greece's ruling government and [[Statute of limitations|a legal principle of limitation]] would apply, i.e., the ability to pursue claims expires after a period of time prescribed by law;&lt;ref name="newsweek stones"/&gt;
The last was tested in the English High Court in May 2005 in relation to Nazi-looted Old Master artworks held at the British Museum, which the Museum's Trustees wished to return to the family of the original owner; the Court found that due to the [[British Museum Act 1963]] these works could not be returned without further legislation. The judge, [[Andrew Morritt|Mr Justice Morritt]], found that the Act, which protects the collections for posterity, could not be overridden by a "moral obligation" to return works, even if they are believed to have been plundered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/may/27/arts.parthenon Ruling tightens grip on Parthenon marbles] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103042358/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/may/27/arts.parthenon |date=3 January 2012 }}, ''The Guardian'', 27 May 2005. Retrieved 5 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Her Majesty's Attorney General v The Trustees of the British Museum, [2005] EWHC (Ch) 1089&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued, however, that the case was not directly relevant to the Elgin Marbles, as it was about a transfer of ownership, and not the loan of artefacts for public exhibition overseas, which is provided for in the 1963 Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elginism.com/20050603/126/|title=Article on the relevance of the Feldmann paintings judgment to the Elgin Marbles.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another argument for keeping the Elgin Marbles within the UK has been made by J. H. Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law at [[Stanford University]] and co-operating professor in the Stanford Art Department. He has argued that
the Marbles are now established as a significant element of Britain's own cultural history, as "the Elgin Marbles have been in England since 1821 and in that time have become a part of the British cultural heritage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Merryman paper|
url=https://law.wustl.edu/harris/Conferences/imperialism/Merryman_PAPER_FINALelgin2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has also argued that if the Parthenon were actually being restored, there would be a moral argument for returning the Marbles to the temple whence they came, and thus restoring its integrity. ''The Guardian'' has written that many among those who support repatriation imply that the marbles would be displayed in their original position on the Parthenon.&lt;ref name="guardian faq"/&gt; However, the Greek plan is to transfer them from a museum in London to one in Athens. These arguments are perhaps complicated a little by the completion of the new [[Acropolis Museum]] in 2009, where the
half not removed by Elgin is now displayed, aligned in orientation and within sight of the [[Parthenon]], 
with the position of the missing elements clearly marked and space left should they be returned to [[Athens]].&lt;ref name="acrop museum"/&gt;

==Public perception of the issue==

===Popular support for restitution===
Outside Greece a campaign for the Return of the Marbles began in 1981 with the formation of the ''[https://iocarpm.wordpress.com/ International Organising Committee - Australia - for the Restitution of the Parthenon Marbles], and in 1983 with the formation of the ''[http://www.parthenonuk.com/ ''British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles'']. International organisations such as [[UNESCO]] and the [[International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]], as well as campaign groups such as, [[Marbles Reunited]], and stars of Hollywood, such as [[George Clooney]] and [[Matt Damon]], as well as Human Rights activists, lawyers, and the people of the arts, voiced their strong support for the return of the Elgin Marbles to Greece.

American actor George Clooney voiced his support for the return by the United Kingdom and reunification of the Parthenon Marbles in Greece, during his promotional campaign for his 2014 film ''[[The Monuments Men]]'' which retells the story of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] efforts to save important masterpieces of art and other culturally important items before their destruction by [[Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] during [[World War II]]. His remarks regarding the Marbles reignited the debate in the United Kingdom about their return to their home country. Public polls were also carried out by newspapers in response to Clooney's stance on this matter.

An internet campaign site,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bringthemback.org |title=Bring Them Back |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part sponsored by [[Metaxa]], aims to consolidate support for the return of the Elgin Marbles to the New Acropolis Museum in Athens.

Noted public intellectual [[Christopher Hitchens]] had, at numerous times, argued for their repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2009/07/hitchens200907 |title=The Lovely Stones |accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In BBC TV Series ''[[QI]]'' (S12E07XL), host [[Stephen Fry]] provided his support for the return of the Elgin Marbles while recounting the story of the Greeks giving lead shot to their [[Ottoman Empire]] enemies, as the Ottomans were running out of ammunition, in order to prevent damage to the Acropolis. Fry had previously written a blog post along much the same lines in December 2011 entitled "A Modest Proposal", signing off with "It's time we lost our marbles"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stephenfry.com/2011/12/19/a-modest-proposal/ |title=A Modest Proposal |accessdate=2014-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Opinion polls===
A [[YouGov]] poll in 2014 suggested that more British people (37%) supported  the marbles' restoration to Greece than opposed it (23%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/10/18/british-people-tend-want-elgin-marbles-returned/|title=British people tend to want Elgin marbles returned|newspaper=Yougov.co.uk|date=18 October 2014|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In older polls, [[Ipsos MORI]] asked in 1998, "If there were a referendum on whether or not the Elgin Marbles should be returned to Greece, how would you vote?" This  returned these values from the British general adult population:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=2001|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130126092318/http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=2001|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-26|title=

*40% in favour of returning the marbles to Greece
*15% in favour of keeping them at the British Museum
*18% would not vote
*27% had no opinion

Another opinion poll in 2002 (again carried out by MORI) showed similar results, with 40% of the British public in favour of returning the marbles to Greece, 16% in favour of keeping them within Britain and the remainder either having no opinion or would not vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=1053|title=Return Of The Parthenon Marbles|publisher=Ipsos MORI|accessdate=18 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409021725/http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=1053|archivedate=9 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked how they would vote if a number of conditions were met (including, but not limited to, a long-term loan whereby the British maintained ownership and joint control over maintenance) the number responding in favour of return increased to 56% and those in favour of keeping them dropped to 7%.

Both MORI poll results have been characterised by proponents of the return of the Marbles to Greece as representing a groundswell of public opinion supporting return, since the proportion explicitly supporting return to Greece significantly exceeds the number who are explicitly in favour of keeping the Marbles at the British Museum.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stosacucine.pk/ |title=Opinion poll: Majority of Britons favor return of Parthenon Marbles |work=stosacucine.pk |date= |accessdate=2009-01-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615202701/http://stosacucine.pk/ |archivedate=15 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of the surviving sculptures that are not in museums or storerooms in Athens are held in museums in various locations across Europe. The British Museum also holds additional fragments from the Parthenon sculptures acquired from various collections that have no connection with Lord Elgin.

The collection held in the British Museum includes the following material from the Acropolis:

==British Museum loan==

The British Museum lent the figure of a river-god, possibly the river [[Ilissos]],
to the [[Hermitage Museum|State Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] to celebrate its 250th
anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/12/05/loan-of-a-parthenon-sculpture-to-the-hermitage-a-marble-ambassador-of-a-european-ideal/ |title=Loan to the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg |publisher=britishmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231192906/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/12/05/loan-of-a-parthenon-sculpture-to-the-hermitage-a-marble-ambassador-of-a-european-ideal/ |archivedate=31 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was on display there from Saturday 6 December 2014 until Sunday 18 January 2015.
This was the first time the British Museum had lent part of its Elgin Marbles collection and it caused considerable
controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/world/europe/elgin-marbles-lent-to-hermitage-museum.html?_r=0

==Labour party leader stance and new dimensions to the dispute caused by Brexit==
In a 2018 interview to the Athens newspaper [[Ta Nea]], quoted later in [[The Independent]], the British [[Labour party (UK)|Labour party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] vowed to return the Marbles to Greece, stating
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As with anything stolen or taken from occupied or colonial possession – including artefacts looted from other countries in the past – we should be engaged in constructive talks with the Greek government about returning the sculptures."&lt;ref name="Corbyn vows to return the Marbles to Greece"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Following the 2016 [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], it has been suggested that the United Kingdom may be forced to return the marbles to Greece as a precondition for an agreement on [[Brexit]], as any agreement between the [[European Union]] and the United Kingdom has to be approved by European Union member Greece.&lt;ref name="Elgin Marbles part of Brexit negotiations"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/08/04/greek-mep-demands-elgin-marbles-become-part-brexit-negotiations/ |title=Greek MEP demands Elgin Marbles become part of Brexit negotiations |publisher=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greece to recover stolen Parthenon art"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dw.com/en/greece-could-use-brexit-to-recover-stolen-parthenon-art/a-40038439 |title=Greece could use Brexit to recover stolen Parthenon art |publisher=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29146">{{English phonology topics}}
In the [[Phonological history of English vowels|history of English phonology]], there have been many [[historical linguistics|diachronic]] sound changes affecting vowels, especially involving [[phonemic differentiation|phonemic splits and mergers]]. A number of these changes are specific to vowels which occur before {{IPA|/l/}}.

==Historical diphthongization before /l/==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}
[[Diphthongization]] occurred since [[Early Modern English]] in certain ''-al-'' and ''-ol-'' sequences before [[coronal consonant|coronal]] or [[velar consonant|velar]] [[consonant]]s, or at the end of a word or morpheme.  In these sequences, {{IPA|/al/}} became {{IPA|/awl/}} and then {{IPA|/ɑul/}}, while {{IPA|/ɔl/}} became {{IPA|/ɔwl/}} and then {{IPA|/ɔul/}}. Both of these merged with existing diphthongs: {{IPA|/ɑu/}} as in ''law'' and {{IPA|/ɔu/}} as in ''throw''.

At the end of a word or morpheme, this produced ''all'', ''ball'', ''call'', ''fall'', ''gall'', ''hall'', ''mall'', ''small'', ''squall'', ''stall'', ''pall'', ''tall'', ''thrall'', ''wall'', ''control'', ''droll'', ''extol'', ''knoll'', ''poll'', ''roll'', ''scroll'', ''stroll'', ''swollen'', ''toll'', and ''troll''.  The word ''shall'' did not follow this trend, and remains {{IPA|/ʃæl/}} today.

Before [[coronal consonant]]s, this produced ''[[Alderney]]'', ''alter'', ''bald'', ''balderdash'', ''false'', ''falter'', ''halt'', ''malt'', ''palsy'', ''salt'', ''[[Wald (disambiguation)|Wald]]'', ''[[Walter (disambiguation)|Walter]]'', ''bold'', ''cold'', ''fold'', ''gold'', ''hold'', ''molten'', ''mould/mold'', ''old'', ''shoulder'' (earlier ''sholder''), ''smolder'', ''told'', and ''wold'' (in the sense of "tract of land").  As with ''shall'', the word ''shalt'' did not follow this trend, and remains {{IPA|/ʃælt/}} today.

Before {{IPA|/k/}}, this produced ''balk'', ''caulk/calk'', ''chalk'', ''[[Dundalk]]'', ''falcon'', ''stalk'', ''talk'', ''walk'', ''folk'', ''[[Polk (disambiguation)|Polk]]'', and ''yolk''.

This L-vocalization established a pattern that would influence the [[spelling pronunciation]]s of some relatively more recent loanwords like ''[[Balt]]'', ''[[Malta]]'', ''waltz'', ''[[Yalta]]'', and ''polder''.  It also influenced [[English spelling reform]] efforts, explaining the [[American English]] ''mold'' and ''molt'' vs. the traditional ''mould'' and ''moult''.

Certain words of more recent origin or coining, however, do not have the change and retain short vowels, including ''Al'', ''alcohol'', ''bal'', ''Cal'', ''calcium'', ''gal'', ''Hal'', ''mal-'', ''pal'', ''Sal'', ''talc'', ''Val'', ''doll'', ''Moll'', and ''Poll''.

===Historical ''L''-vocalization===
In most circumstances, the changes stopped there.  But in ''-alk'' and ''-olk'' words, the {{IPA|/l/}} disappeared entirely in most accents (with the notable exception of [[Hiberno-English]]).  This change caused {{IPA|/ɑulk/}} to become {{IPA|/ɑuk/}}, and {{IPA|/ɔulk/}} to become {{IPA|/ɔuk/}}.  Even outside Ireland, some of these words have more than one pronunciation that retains the {{IPA|/l/}} sound, especially in American English where spelling pronunciations caused partial or full reversal of L-vocalization in a handful of cases:
* ''caulk/calk'' can be {{IPA|/ˈkɔːlk/}} or {{IPA|/ˈkɔːk/}}.
* ''falcon'' can be {{IPA|/ˈfælkən/}}, {{IPA|/ˈfɔːlkən/}} or {{IPA|/ˈfɔːkən/}}.
* ''yolk'' can be {{IPA|/ˈjoʊlk/}} or {{IPA|/ˈjoʊk/}}.  ''yoke'' as {{IPA|/ˈjoʊk/}} is only conditionally [[homophone|homophonous]].

Words like ''fault'' and ''vault'' did not undergo L-vocalization, but rather L-restoration, having previously been L-vocalized independently in [[Old French]] and lacking the {{IPA|/l/}} in Middle English, but having it restored by Early Modern English.  The word ''falcon'' existed simultaneously as homonyms ''fauco(u)n'' and ''falcon'' in Middle English.  The word ''moult/molt'' never originally had {{IPA|/l/}} to begin with, instead deriving from Middle English ''mout'' and related etymologically to ''mutate''; the {{IPA|/l/}} joined the word intrusively.

The [[Great Vowel Shift]] changed the diphthongs to their present pronunciations, with {{IPA|/ɑu/}} becoming the monophthong {{IPA|/ɔː/}}, and {{IPA|/ɔu/}} raising to {{IPA|/oʊ/}}.

The loss of {{IPA|/l/}} in words spelt with ''-alf'', ''-alm'', ''-alve'' and ''-olm'' did not involve L-vocalization in the same sense, but rather the elision of the consonant and usually the [[compensatory lengthening]] of the vowel.

==Variation between /ɔːl/ and /ɒl/ in ''salt'' and similar words==
Some words such as ''salt'' that traditionally had /ɔːl/ for most RP speakers have alternative pronunciations with /ɒl/ that are used more frequently by younger British English speakers. This variation between /ɔːl/ and /ɒl/ occurs primarily before voiceless consonants, as in ''salt,'' ''false'' and ''alter,'' although it may also occur less commonly in words such as ''scald'' where the /l/ comes before a voiced consonant.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, John (2010). "[http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2010/02/scolding-water.html scolding water]" (February 16). John Wells’s phonetic blog. Retrieved 2016-01-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In England, this laxing before /l/ was traditionally associated with the north but has in recent decades become more widespread, including among younger speakers of RP.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Modern ''L''-vocalization==
More extensive L-vocalization is a notable feature of certain dialects of [[English language|English]], including [[Cockney]], [[Estuary English]], [[New York City English|New York English]], [[New Zealand English]], [[Pittsburgh English|Pittsburgh]] and [[Philadelphia dialect|Philadelphia English]], in which an {{IPA|/l/}} sound occurring at the end of a word or before a consonant is pronounced as some sort of close back vocoid, e.g., {{IPA|[w]}}, {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[ʊ]}}.  The resulting sound may not always be rounded.  The precise phonetic quality varies.  It can be heard occasionally in the dialect of the English [[East Midlands]], where words ending in -old can be pronounced {{IPA|/oʊd/}}.  [[KM Petyt]] (1985) noted this feature in the traditional dialect of West Yorkshire but said it has died out.&lt;ref&gt;KM Petyt, ''Dialect &amp; Accent in Industrial West Yorkshire'', John Benjamins Publishing Company, page 219&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent decades l-vocalization has been spreading outwards from London and the south east,&lt;ref&gt;Asher, R.E., Simpson, J.M.Y. (1993). ''The Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics''. Pergamon. p. 4043. {{ISBN|978-0080359434}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kortmann, Bernd et al. (2004). ''A Handbook of Varieties of English''. Mouton de Gruyter. p. 196. {{ISBN|978-3110175325}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John C Wells]] argued that it is probable that it will become the standard pronunciation in England over the next one hundred years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Wells, John C. | title=Accents of English | location=[[Cambridge]] | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1982 | isbn=0-521-22919-7 | id=(vol. 1), {{ISBN|0-521-24224-X}} (vol. 2), {{ISBN|0-521-24225-8}} (vol. 3) | authorlink=John C. Wells}}: Vol. 1, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; an idea which Petyt criticised in a book review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Petyt |first1=KM |year=1982 |title=Reviews: JC Wells: Accents of English|journal=Journal of the International Phonetic Association |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=104–112 |publisher=Cambridge |doi=10.1017/S0025100300002516 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1796764&amp;fulltextType=BR&amp;fileId=S0025100300002516 |accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cockney, Estuary English and New Zealand English, l-vocalization can be accompanied by [[phonemic differentiation|phonemic mergers]] of vowels before the vocalized {{IPA|/l/}}, so that ''real'', ''reel'' and ''rill'', which are distinct in most dialects of English, are homophones as {{IPA|[ɹɪw]}}.

Graham Shorrocks noted extensive L-vocalisation in the dialect of [[Bolton, Greater Manchester]] and commented, "many, perhaps, associate such a quality more with Southern dialects, than with Lancashire/Greater Manchester."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shorrocks|first=Graham|title=A Grammar of the Dialect of the Bolton Area. Pt. 2:  Morphology and syntax|publisher=Peter Lang|page=255|location=Frankfurt am Main|year=1999|series=Bamberger Beiträge zur englischen Sprachwissenschaft; Bd. 42|isbn=3-631-34661-1}} (based on the author's thesis (Ph. D.)--University of Sheffield, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the accent of [[Bristol]], syllabic {{IPA|/l/}} can be vocalized to {{IPA|/o/}}, resulting in pronunciations like {{IPA|/ˈbɒto/}} (for ''bottle''). By [[hypercorrection]], however, some words originally ending in {{IPA|/o/}} were given an {{IPA|/l/}}: the original name of the town was ''Bristow'', but this has been altered by hypercorrection to ''Bristol''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[African-American English]] (AAE) dialects may have L-vocalization as well.  However, in these dialects, it may be omitted altogether (e.g. fool becomes {{IPA|[fuː]}}.  Some English speakers from San Francisco - particularly those of Asian ancestry - also vocalize or omit {{IPA|/l/}}.&lt;ref&gt;L Hall-Lew &amp; RL Starr, ''Beyond the 2nd generation: English use among Chinese Americans in the San Francisco Bay Area'', English Today: The International Review of the English Language, Vol. 26, Issue 3, pp. 12-19. [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayIssue?jid=ENG&amp;volumeId=26&amp;seriesId=0&amp;issueId=03]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Salary–celery'' merger==
The '''''salary–celery'' merger''' is a conditioned merger of {{IPA|/æ/}} (as in ''bat'') and {{IPA|/ɛ/}} (as in ''bet'') when they occur before {{IPA|/l/}}, thus making ''salary'' and ''celery'' [[homophone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cox, F. |author2=Palethorpe, S. | year = 2001 | chapter = The Changing Face of Australian Vowels | editor = Blair, D.B. |editor2=Collins, P | title = Varieties of English Around the World: English in Australia | publisher = John Benjamins Publishing, Amsterdam | pages = 17–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox, F.

Poster presented at the International Seminar on Speech Production, December 2003, Sydney. '''''Note:''' online version is [[PDF]].''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, John. [http://emsah.uq.edu.au/linguistics/teaching/norfolk/Varieties-Norfolk-Phon-Ingram&amp;Muhl.pdf Norfolk Island-Pitcairn English (Pitkern Norfolk)], ''[[University of Queensland]]'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The merger is not well studied. It is referred to in various sociolinguistic publications, but usually only as a small section of the larger change undergone by vowels preceding {{IPA|/l/}} in articles about [[l-vocalization|''l''-vocalization]].

This merger has been detected in the English spoken in [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]] and in [[Wangaratta, Victoria]], [[Australia]]. In varieties with the merger, ''salary'' and ''celery'' are both pronounced {{IPA|/sæləri/}} (Cox &amp; Palethorpe, 2003).

The Cox and Palethorpe study presented at a 2003 conference tested just one group of speakers from Victoria: 13 fifteen-year-old girls from a Catholic girls' school in Wangaratta. Their pronunciations were compared with those of school girl groups in the towns of [[Temora, New South Wales|Temora]], [[Junee]] and [[Wagga Wagga]] in [[New South Wales]]. In the study conducted by Cox and Palethorpe, the group in Wangaratta exhibited the merger while speakers in Temora, Junee and Wagga Wagga did not. In the same study Cox and Palethorpe note that "There is no evidence in this data of raised /æ/ before /l/ as in 'Elbert' for 'Albert', a phenomenon that has been popularly suggested for Victorians."&lt;ref name="Cox, F. M. and Palethorpe, S. 2003 1–14"/&gt;

Horsfield (2001) investigates the effects of postvocalic {{IPA|/l/}} on the preceding vowels in [[New Zealand English]]; her investigation covers all of the [[New Zealand English]] vowels and is not specifically tailored to studying mergers and neutralizations, but rather the broader change that occurs across the vowels. She has suggested that further research involving minimal pairs like ''telly'' and ''tally'', ''celery'' and ''salary'' should be done before any firm conclusions are drawn.

A pilot study of the merger was done, which yielded perception and production data from a few [[New Zealand]] speakers. The results of the pilot survey suggested that although the merger was not found in the speech of all participants, those who produced a distinction between {{IPA|/æl/}} and {{IPA|/el/}} also accurately perceived a difference between them; those who merged {{IPA|/æl/}} and {{IPA|/el/}} were less able to accurately perceive the distinction. The finding has been interesting to some linguists because it concurs with the recent understanding that ''losing a distinction between two sounds involves losing the ability to produce it as well as to perceive it'' (Gordon 2002). However, due to the very small number of people participating in the study the results are not conclusive.

==''Fill–feel'' merger==
[[File:Il-iyl.svg|thumb|The areas marked in red are where the ''fill–feel'' merger is most consistently present in the local accent. Map based on Labov, Ash, and Boberg (2006: 71).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/Map4.html |title=Map 4 |publisher=Ling.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''''fill–feel'' merger''' is a conditioned merger of the vowels {{IPA|/ɪ/}} and {{IPA|/iː/}} before {{IPA|/l/}} that occurs in some dialects of [[American English]]. The heaviest concentration of the merger is found in, but not necessarily confined to [[Southern American English]]: in [[North Carolina]], eastern [[Tennessee]], northern [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], [[Louisiana]] (but not [[New Orleans]]), and west-central [[Texas]] (Labov, Ash, and Boberg 2006: 69-73). This merger, like many other features of Southern American English, can also be found in [[African-American English|AAE]].

==''Fell–fail'' merger==
The same two regions show a closely related merger, namely the '''''fell–fail'' merger''' of {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/eɪ/}} before {{IPA|/l/}} that occurs in some varieties of [[Southern American English]] making ''fell'' and ''fail'' homophones. In addition to North Carolina and Texas, these mergers are found sporadically in other Southern states and in the Midwest and West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/Map7.html |title=Map 7 |publisher=Ling.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20061028164228/http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phonoatlas/Atlas_chapters/Ch9/Ch9.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Full–fool'' merger==
The '''''full–fool'' merger''' is a conditioned merger of {{IPA|/ʊ/}} and {{IPA|/uː/}} before {{IPA|/l/}}, making pairs like ''pull''/''pool'' and ''full''/''fool'' homophones. The main concentration of the ''pull–pool'' merger is in [[Western Pennsylvania English]], centered around [[Pittsburgh]]. The merger is less consistently but still noticeably present in some speakers of surrounding [[Midland American English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/Map5.html |title=Map 5 |publisher=Ling.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Atlas of North American English]]'' also reports this merger, or near-merger, scattered sporadically throughout [[Western American English]], with particular prevalence in some speakers of urban Utahn, [[Californian English|Californian]], and [[New Mexican English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accents with [[L-vocalization|''L''-vocalization]], such as [[New Zealand English]], [[Estuary English]] and [[Cockney]], may also have the ''full–fool'' merger in most cases, but when a suffix beginning with a vowel is appended, the distinction returns: Hence 'pull' and 'pool' are {{IPA|[pʊo]}}, but 'pulling' is {{IPA|/ˈpʊlɪŋ/}} whereas 'pooling' remains {{IPA|/ˈpuːlɪŋ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/transcree-uni.htm |title=Transcribing Estuary English |publisher=Phon.ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''fill–feel'' merger and ''full–fool'' merger are ''not'' unified in American English; they are found in different parts of the country, and very few people show either or both mergers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/Map6.html |title=Map 6 |publisher=Ling.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Hull–hole'' merger==
The '''''hull–hole'' merger''' is a conditioned merger of {{IPA|/ʌ/}} and {{IPA|/oʊ/}} before {{IPA|/l/}} occurring for some speakers of [[English English]] with [[l-vocalization|''l''-vocalization]]. As a result, "hull" and "hole" are homophones as {{IPA|[hɔʊ]}}. The merger is also mentioned by Labov, Ash, and Boberg (2006: 72) as a merger before {{IPA|/l/}} in [[North American English]] that might require further study.

==''Doll–dole'' merger==
The '''''doll–dole'' merger''' is a conditioned merger, for some Londoners, of {{IPA|/ɒ/}} and {{IPA|/əʊ/}} before word-final {{IPA|/l/}}. As a result, ''doll'' and ''dole'' may become homophones.&lt;ref name="wells_317"&gt;Wells: 317&lt;/ref&gt; If the {{IPA|/l/}} is morpheme-final, as in ''doll''-''dole'', the underlying vowel is still distinguished in derived forms such as ''dolling''/''doling''.&lt;ref name="wells_317"/&gt;

Where the {{IPA|/l/}} is not word-final, however, the distinction is not recoverable. That may lead to ''sold'' having the same vowel sound as ''solve'' as well as [[hypercorrections]] such as {{IPA|/səʊlv/}} for ''solve'' (RP {{IPA|/sɒlv/}}).&lt;ref name="wells_317"/&gt; There do not appear to be any [[minimal pair]]s in this environment since RP {{IPA|/ɒl/}} and {{IPA|/əʊl/}} are in more-or-less complementary distribution in stressed syllables, with {{IPA|/ɒl/}} before {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} (e.g. ''golf'', ''dolphin'', ''solve'', ''revolve'') and {{IPA|/əʊl/}} elsewhere (e.g. ''bolt'', ''polka'', ''gold'', ''soldier'', ''holster'').

==''Fool-fall'' homophony==

For some English speakers in the UK, the vowels of ''goose'' and ''thought'' may be merged before dark syllable-final /l/. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindsey|first1=Geoff|title=People fool in love (extended mix)|url=http://englishspeechservices.com/blog/people-fool-in-love-extended/|website=Speech Talk Blog|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This neutralization has been found to exist for clusters of speakers in the southern UK, especially for speakers from areas of the south coast and the Greater London area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Laurel|last2=Bailey|first2=George|last3=Turton|first3=Danielle|title=Who pronounces ‘fool’ and ‘fall’ the same?|url=http://projects.alc.manchester.ac.uk/ukdialectmaps/phonological-variation/fool-fall/|website=Our Dialects: Mapping variation in English in the UK|accessdate=25 March 2018|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Goat'' split==
The '''''goat'' split''' is a process that has affected [[London]] dialects and [[Estuary English]].&lt;ref name="wells_312"&gt;Wells, p. 312-313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
|title=Estuary English: Levelling at the Interface of RP and South-Eastern British English
|first=Ulrike
|last=Altendorf
|publisher = Gunter Narr Verlag
|year= 2003
|isbn= 3-8233-6022-1
|location=Tübingen
|page=34
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHDbDUs5t48C
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the first phase of the split, the diphthong of ''goat'' {{IPA|/əʊ/}} developed an [[allophone]] {{IPA|[ɒʊ]}} before "dark" (nonprevocalic) {{IPA|/l/}}. Thus ''goal'' no longer had the same vowel as ''goat'' ({{IPA|[ɡɒʊɫ]}} vs. {{IPA|[ɡəʊʔ]}}).&lt;ref name="wells_312"/&gt; In the second phase, the diphthong {{IPA|[ɒʊ]}} spread to other forms of affected words. For example, the realization of ''rolling'' changed from {{IPA|[ˈɹəʊlɪŋ]}} to {{IPA|[ˈɹɒʊlɪŋ]}} on the model of ''roll'' {{IPA|[ɹɒʊɫ]}}. This led to the creation of a [[minimal pair]] for some speakers: ''wholly'' {{IPA|/ˈhɒʊli/}} vs. ''holy'' {{IPA|/ˈhəʊli/}} and thus to phonemicization of the split.

In broad Cockney, the phonetic difference between the two phonemes may be rather small and they may be distinguished by nothing more than the openness of the first element, so that ''goat'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ɡɐɤʔ]}} whereas ''goal'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ɡaɤ]}}.&lt;ref name="wells_312"/&gt;

==''Vile–vial'' merger==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
The '''''vile–vial'' merger''' is where the words in the ''vile'' set ending with {{IPA|/-ˈaɪl/}} (''bile'', ''file'', ''guile'', ''I'll'', ''Kyle'', ''Lyle'', ''mile'', ''Nile'', ''pile'', ''rile'', ''smile'', ''stile'', ''style'', ''tile'', ''vile'', ''while'', ''wile'') rhyme with words in the ''vial'' set ending with {{IPA|/-ˈaɪəl/}} (''decrial'', ''denial'', ''dial'', ''espial'', ''Niall'', ''phial'', ''trial'', ''vial'', ''viol'').&lt;ref&gt;According to Dictionary.com,  [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dial dial], [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/trial trial] and [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/vial vial] all specify variable {{IPA|/-ˈaɪəl/}} or {{IPA|/-ˈaɪl/}} pronunciations, while words like [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bile bile] and [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/style style] only specify {{IPA|/-ˈaɪl/}} pronunciations.&lt;/ref&gt;  This merger involves the dephonemicization of [[schwa]] that occurs after a vowel and before {{IPA|/l/}}, causing the vowel-{{IPA|/l/}} sequence to be pronounced as either one or two syllables.

This merger may also be encountered with other vowel rhymes too, including:
* {{IPA|/-ˈeɪl/}} (''gaol'', ''sale'', ''tail'', etc.) and {{IPA|/-ˈeɪəl/}} (''betrayal'', ''Jael''), usually skewing towards two syllables.
* {{IPA|/-ˈɔɪl/}} (''coil'', ''soil'', etc.) and {{IPA|/-ˈɔɪəl/}} (''loyal'', ''royal''), usually skewing towards two syllables.
* {{IPA|/-ˈiːl/}} (''ceil'', ''feel'', ''steal'', etc.) and {{IPA|/-ˈiːəl/}} (''real''), usually skewing towards two syllables.
* {{IPA|/-ˈɔːl/}} (''all'', ''drawl'', ''haul'', etc.) and {{IPA|/-ˈɔːəl/}} (''withdrawal''), usually skewing towards one syllable.
* {{IPA|/-ˈoʊl/}} (''bowl'', ''coal'', ''hole'', ''roll'', ''soul'', etc.) and {{IPA|/-ˈoʊəl/}} (''Joel'', ''Noel''), usually skewing towards one syllable.
* {{IPA|/-ˈuːl/}} (''cool'', ''ghoul'', ''mewl'', ''rule'', ''you'll'', etc.) and {{IPA|/-ˈuːəl/}} (''cruel'', ''dual'', ''duel'', ''fuel'', ''gruel'', ''jewel''), usually skewing towards one syllable.
* {{IPA|/-ˈaʊl/}} (''owl'', ''scowl'', etc.) and {{IPA|/-ˈaʊəl/}} (''bowel'', ''dowel'', ''Powell'', ''towel'', ''trowel'', ''vowel''), inconsistently skewing towards either one or two syllables.  Some words may wander across this boundary even in some non-merging accents, such as ''owl'' with {{IPA|/-ˈaʊəl/}}, and ''bowel'' with {{IPA|/-ˈaʊl/}}.
* In some [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] accents, {{IPA|/-ˈɜːrl/}} (''girl'', ''hurl'', ''pearl'', etc.) and {{IPA|/-ˈɜːrəl/}} (''referral''), usually skewing towards two syllables.  This historically happened to the word ''squirrel'', which was previously {{IPA|/ˈskwɪrəl/}} (and still is in certain accents), but it actually became one syllable {{IPA|/ˈskwɜː(r)l/}} in [[General American]] today.  But some accents with one-syllable ''squirrel'' later broke it again into two syllables, but as {{IPA|/ˈskwɜːrəl/}}.
* In some rhotic [[father–bother merger|''father–bother'' merger]] accents, {{IPA|/-ˈɑrl/}} (''Carl'', ''marl'', etc.) and {{IPA|/-ˈɑrəl/}} (''coral'', ''moral''), usually skewing towards two syllables.

For many speakers, the vowels in ''cake'', ''meet'', ''vote'' and ''moot'' can become centering diphthongs before {{IPA|/l/}}, leading to pronunciations like {{IPA|[teəl]}}, {{IPA|[tiəl]}}, {{IPA|[toəl]}} and {{IPA|[tuəl]}} for ''tail'', ''teal'', ''toll'' and ''tool''.

==Other mergers==
Labov, Ash, and Boberg (2006:73) mention four mergers before {{IPA|/l/}} that may be under way in some accents of [[North American English]], and which require more study:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[William Labov|Labov, William]], Sharon Ash, and Charles Boberg | year=2006 | title=The Atlas of North American English | location=Berlin | publisher=Mouton-de Gruyter | isbn=3-11-016746-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/ʊl/}} and {{IPA|/oʊl/}} (''bull'' vs ''bowl'')
* {{IPA|/ʌl/}} and {{IPA|/ɔːl/}} (''hull'' vs ''hall'')
* {{IPA|/ʊl/}} and {{IPA|/ʌl/}} (''bull'' vs ''hull'')
* {{IPA|/ʌl/}} and {{IPA|/oʊl/}} (''hull'' vs ''hole'') ([[#Hull–hole merger|''Hull–hole'' merger]])

[[File: European Glass Experience (logo).jpg|thumb|European Glass Experience Logo]]
'''European Glass Experience''' is a project coordinated by the City of [[Venice]] in collaboration with Consorzio Promovetro Murano and the [[Murano Glass Museum]]. It represents an international celebration of contemporary glass art and, most of all, of its makers.

==The project==
EGE was officially launched on September 11, 2013 during a press conference at [[Ca' Farsetti]] in [[Venice]], and its aim is to valorise the glass art on a European level, and to promote the works of local and international young artists. European Glass Experience was established to reinforce glass production and to improve the artistic heritage of traditional glass working experience. The project has among its partners The Finnish Glass Museum, [[Riihimaki]], [[Finland]], and the Fundación Centro Nacional del Vidrio, La Granja de San Idelfonso, [[Segovia]], [[Spain]]. Associated partners are the Glass Factory in Boda Glasbruk, [[Sweden]], the Muzeum Witrazu (Stained Glass Museum) in [[Krakow]], the International Festival of Glass in [[Stourbridge]], [[England]] and the Glass Museum of Marinha Grande (Portugal). European Glass Experience project is co-financed by a prestigious two-year grant from the Culture Program 2007 – 2013 of the [[European Union]]. The project will last two years, and it is composed by an exhibition which will take place in three different museums, divided into two sections: 40 unreleased glass artworks and 20 sketches which will become artworks, realised by Promovetro’s Murano glass masters.

==The exhibition==

The exhibition began at The Finnish Glass Museum, Riihimaki, Finland, in March 2014, curated by Uta Laurén, and then continued to the Fundación Centro Nacional del Vidrio, Spain, under the directorship of Paloma Pastor. The final venue will be the Murano Glass Museum, directed by Chiara Squarcina in March 2015. Further additional venues, among the associated partners, will possibly follow. European Glass Experience team panel, made of museum directors, curators, and glass experts, selected nearly 80 sketches and artworks, coming from young artists of different cultures. Murano Glass masters associated with Promovetro are going to realize a selection of the most peculiar sketches in glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egeglass.eu/|title=EGE - European Glass Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Folklore of the United States|Arkansas folklore]], the '''Fouke Monster''' is said to have been seen in [[Fouke, Arkansas|Fouke]] in [[Miller County, Arkansas|Miller County]], [[Arkansas]], during the early 1970s. The creature was accused of attacking a local family. Initial sightings of the creature were concentrated in the Jonesville/Boggy Creek area, where it was blamed for the destruction of local livestock. Later, sightings were made several hundred miles to the north and the east of Fouke.

The creature was named by journalist Jim Powell, who reported on it for the ''[[Texarkana Gazette]]'' and the ''[[Texarkana Gazette|Texarkana Daily News]]''.&lt;ref name="30pl"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sunni |last=Thibodeau |title=The Fouke Monster 30 Years Later: Ex-journalists recall sifting fact from Fouke fiction after sighting |url=http://texarkanagazette.com/articles/2001/06/24/export15709.txt |work=Texarkana Gazette |date=2001-06-24 |accessdate=2006-10-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803215531/http://texarkanagazette.com/articles/2001/06/24/export15709.txt |archivedate=2003-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Various reports between 1971 and 1974 described the creature as being a large [[Hominidae|hominid-like]] creature covered in long dark hair, which was estimated to be about {{convert|7|ft|m|0}} tall with a weight of {{convert|250|-|300|lb}}. Witnesses said that its chest was about {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} wide.{{fact|date=June 2018}} Later reports, published during the early 1980s, claimed that it was far larger, with one report describing it as {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} tall, with an estimated weight of {{convert|800|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref name="farish1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Lou |last=Farish |title=Fouke Monster Still Alive and Well |url=http://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_article.asp?id=258 |work=Arkansas Democrat |date=1981-10-25 |accessdate=2006-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some accounts describe the Fouke Monster as running swiftly with a galloping gait and swinging its arms in a fashion similar to a [[monkey]].&lt;ref name="farish1" /&gt; Reports also describe it as having a terrible odor, the odor being described as a combination of a [[skunk]] and a wet [[dog]], and as having bright red eyes about the size of silver dollars.&lt;ref name="gazettemay31971"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fouke fields combed in search of monster |work=Texarkana Gazette |date=1971-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Silver dollar coins minted in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are {{convert|1.5|in|mm|1}} in diameter.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of tracks and claw marks have been discovered which are claimed to belong to the creature. One set of foot prints reportedly measured {{convert|17|in|cm}} in length and {{convert|7|in|cm}} wide, while another appeared to show that the creature only had three toes.&lt;ref name="30pl" /&gt;

==Chronology==

=== Before 1971 ===

The first reported sightings were in 1953, and in 1955 when it was spotted by a 14-year-old boy. The boy described it as having reddish brown hair, sniffed the air, and did not react when it was fired upon with [[Shotgun shell|birdshot]]. Investigator [[Joe Nickell]] observes that the description is consistent with a misidentified [[American black bear|black bear]] (''Ursus americanus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Nickell |first=Joe |author-link=Joe Nickell |date=Summer 2015 |title=Bigfoot Roundup: Some Regional Variants Identified as Bears |url=https://www.csicop.org/sb/show/bigfoot_roundup_some_regional_variants_identified_as_bears |magazine=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|CSI]] |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most cases date from the early 1970s onwards, Fouke residents claim that an [[ape|ape-like]] creature had roamed the area since 1964,&lt;ref name="jwgreen1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=John Willison |title=Sasquatch: The Apes Among Us |edition=1st |publisher=Hancock House |location=Saanichton, B.C.; Seattle, WA |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-888-39018-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but those sightings had not been reported to news services. Local legend also holds that the creature can be further traced back to sightings in 1946.&lt;ref name="fouketourist1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkansasmediaroom.com/news-releases/listings/display.asp?id=185 |title=Legendary Arkansas Monsters Have Deep Roots in History |last=Ogilvie |first=Craig |publisher=[[Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism]] |date=2002-10-08 |accessdate=2006-10-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213600/http://www.arkansasmediaroom.com/news-releases/listings/display.asp?id=185 |archivedate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most early sightings were in the region of Jonesville.  Owing to this, the creature was known as the "Jonesville Monster" during this period.&lt;ref name="smokey1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crabtree |first=Julius E. "Smokey" |title=Smokey and The Fouke Monster |publisher=Day's Creek Production Corp. |year=1974 |location=Fouke, AR |isbn=978-0-970-16320-2 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smokey2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Thibodeau |first=Sunni |title=Crabtree book still generates interest |url=http://texarkanagazette.com/articles/2001/06/24/export15697.txt |work=Texarkana Gazette |date=2001-06-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803215557/http://texarkanagazette.com/articles/2001/06/24/export15697.txt |archivedate=2003-08-03 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 20th century reports, several reports in the general area have been tied to the Fouke Monster. The two most widely circulated reports focus on an 1851 report in the ''Memphis Enquirer'', and an 1856 report in the ''Caddo Gazette''.&lt;ref name="skeptoid"  /&gt;

=== After 1971 ===
Despite claims of earlier sightings, the Fouke Monster first made headlines in 1971, when it was reported to have attacked the home of Bobby and Elizabeth Ford late on the night of May 2.  &lt;ref name="gazettemay31971" /&gt;&lt;ref name=texdaillion&gt;{{cite news |title=Monster may be mountain lion |work=Texarkana Daily News |date=1971-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arkgaz1"&gt;{{cite news |title='Creature' attacked, victim says |work=Arkansas Gazette |date=1971-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Elizabeth Ford, the creature, which she initially took to be a [[bear]], reached through a screen window while she was sleeping on a couch. It was chased away by her husband and his brother Don, who were&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texarkanagazette.com/articles/2001/06/24/export15694.txt |work=Texarkana Gazette |title=The Fouke Monster: A look at how the media recorded the reports of the 1971 alleged sighting of a large creature in rural Miller County, Ark.|date=2001-06-24 |accessdate=2006-10-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803214623/http://texarkanagazette.com/articles/2001/06/24/export15694.txt |archivedate=2003-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;suffering from mild [[Acute stress reaction|shock]] when he arrived.

During the encounters, the Fords fired several shots at the creature and believed that they had hit it, though no traces of blood were found. An extensive search of the area failed to locate the creature, but three-toed footprints were found close to the house, scratch marks on the porch, and some damage to a window and the house's [[siding]].&lt;ref name="powell2"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Powell |title=The Fouke Monster: A look at how the media recorded the reports of the 1971 alleged sighting of a large creature in rural Miller County, Ark. |url=http://www.texarkanagazette.com/articles/2001/06/24/export15694.txt |work=Texarkana Gazette |date=2001-06-24 |accessdate=2006-10-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803214623/http://texarkanagazette.com/articles/2001/06/24/export15694.txt |archivedate=2003-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Fords, they had heard something moving around outside late at night several nights before their encounter but, having lived in the house for less than a week, had never encountered the creature before.&lt;ref name="powell2" /&gt;

The creature was spotted again on May 23, 1971, when three people, D. C. Woods, Jr., Wilma Woods, and Mrs. R. H. Sedgass, reported seeing an ape-like creature crossing [[U.S. Route 71|U.S. Highway 71]].&lt;ref name="texdailygroup"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Powell |title='Monster' is spotted by Texarkana group |work=Texarkana Daily News |date=1971-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More sightings were made over the following months by local residents and tourists, who found additional footprints.&lt;ref name=powell1&gt;{{cite news |last=Powell |first=Barry |title=He's been sighted again: Monster&amp;nbsp; – a monkey's uncle |work=Texarkana Gazette |date=1971-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known footprints were found in a soybean field belonging to local [[filling station]] owner Scott Keith. They were scrutinized by game warden Carl Galyon, who was unable to confirm their authenticity.&lt;ref name="30pl" /&gt; Like the Ford prints, they appeared to indicate that the creature had only three toes.&lt;ref name=smithnews1&gt;{{cite news|title=Tracks of the incredible three-toed Fouke Monster |work=Arkansas Gazette |date=1971-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creature began to attract substantial interest during the early 1970s. Soon after news spread about the Ford sighting, the [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], radio station [[KAAY]] posted a $1,090 [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] on the creature.&lt;ref name="30pl" /&gt; Several attempts were made to track the creature with dogs, but they were unable to follow its scent.&lt;ref name="powell2" /&gt; When hunters began to take interest in the Fouke Monster, Miller County Sheriff Leslie Greer was forced to put a temporary "no guns" policy in place in order to preserve public safety.&lt;ref name="30pl" /&gt; In 1971, three people were fined $59 each "for filing a fraudulent monster report."&lt;ref name="30pl" /&gt;

After an initial surge of attention, public interest in the creature decreased until 1973. It was boosted significantly when [[Charles B. Pierce]] released a documentary-style horror feature on the creature in 1972, ''[[The Legend of Boggy Creek]]''. By late 1974, interest had waned again and sightings all but stopped, only to begin again in March 1978 when tracks were reportedly found by two brothers prospecting in [[Russellville, Arkansas]]. There were also sightings in [[Center Ridge, Arkansas]]. On June 26 of that same year, a sighting was reported in [[Crossett, Arkansas]].

During this period the creature was blamed for missing livestock and attacks on several dogs.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

Since the initial clusters of sightings during the 1970s, there have been sporadic reports of the creature. In 1991 the creature was reportedly seen jumping from a bridge.&lt;ref name=USAToday1&gt;{{cite web |title=Stories of ghosts, monsters, unexplained phenomena haunt Arkansas |work=USA Today |date=2005-10-31 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2005-10-31-ghosts-ark_x.htm |accessdate=2006-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were forty reported sightings in 1997 and, in 1998, the creature was reportedly sighted in a dry [[stream bed|creek bed]] {{convert|5|mi|0}} south of Fouke.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

More recent sightings from 2000–2010 were brought to light by [[Lyle Blackburn]]'s 2012 book, ''The Beast of Boggy Creek: The True Story of the Fouke Monster''.{{fact|date=June 2018}} In one case, a married couple saw a large, hairy bipedal creature run across a county road near Fouke in 2010.

==Reception and hoax==
One month after the Ford sighting, Southern State College (currently known as [[Southern Arkansas University]]) [[archaeologist]] Dr. Frank Schambach determined that "There is a 99 percent chance the tracks are a hoax."&lt;ref name="The Fouke Hoax"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Fouke Hoax? |work=Texarkana Gazette |date=1971-06-17 |url=http://www.bigfootencounters.com/hoaxes/fouke_hoax.htm |accessdate=2006-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Schambach, the tracks could not be from a species of ape, as claimed by witnesses, because they were from a three-toed creature, whereas all [[primate]]s, including hominids, have had five toes. In addition to the number of toes, Schambach cited several other anomalies as part of his conclusion: the region had no history of primate activity, ruling out the possibility of the creature being the remnants of an indigenous species; all primates are completely [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]], the Fouke Monster appeared to be partially [[nocturnal]].&lt;ref name="The Fouke Hoax" /&gt;

By 1986, the mayor of Fouke, Virgil Roberts, and former Miller County Sheriff Leslie Greer, were of the opinion that the alleged Fouke Monster tracks were man-made. Greer's working colleague at that time, Chief Deputy H. L. Phillips, said that he had not taken calls regarding the monster in years. Personally, he does not believe the creature exists. "...I don't believe in it. But I'd say you don't argue with people who say they've seen it. Many were respectable and responsible folks," Phillips said.&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;{{cite news |title=15 Summers After Tracks Found, Fouke Monster Called Hoax |first=Scott |last=Charton |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/15-Summers-After-Tracks-Found-Fouke-Monster-Called-Hoax/id-ea887a2b753c4eee87fc69891e08c391 |agency=Associated Press |date=1986-07-21 |accessdate=2013-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brian Dunning (author)|Skeptoid]] [[podcast]] concludes "So in total, every last shred of evidence that the Fouke Monster exists at all is anecdotal. Not a single piece is testable. The Fouke Monster fits very poorly with the model of a living animal, but fits very well with a local legend."&lt;ref name="skeptoid"&gt;{{Skeptoid |id=4404 |number=404 |title=The Boggy Creek Monster |date=4 March 2014 |last=Dunning |first=Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==

This is Lyle Blackburn's comprehensive guide to the Fouke Monster.&lt;ref name="blackburn1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Blackburn |first=Lyle |year=2012 |title=The Beast of Boggy Creek: The True Story of the Fouke Monster |publisher=Anomalist Books |location=San Antonio, TX |url=http://www.anomalistbooks.com/book.cfm?id=63 |isbn=978-1-933-66557-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book covers the history of the Fouke Monster and the making of the 1972 horror [[docudrama]], ''[[The Legend of Boggy Creek]]'', including information on little-known reports since the 1980s.

==Films==

=== ''The Legend of Boggy Creek'' (1972) ===
{{main|The Legend of Boggy Creek}}
The story of Bobby Ford's encounter with the Fouke Monster was the subject of a 1972 semi-factual, documentary-style horror feature, ''[[The Legend of Boggy Creek]]''&lt;ref name="fouketourist1" /&gt; (initially titled ''Tracking the Fouke Monster''),&lt;ref name="VictoriaAd"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19730823&amp;id=uyNIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LYEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6603,3823125 |title=Community Caught By Surprise: Legendary Monster Becomes Money-Maker |work=[[The Victoria Advocate]] |date=1973-08-23 |page=7C}}&lt;/ref&gt; which played in movie and [[drive-in theater]]s around the country.&lt;ref name="sun1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sunni |last=Thibodeau |title=Monstermania: 30 years hence: 'Legend of Boggy Creek' considered a cult classic |url=http://www.texarkanagazette.com/articles/2001/06/24/export15695.txt |work=Texarkana Gazette |date=2001-06-24 |accessdate=2006-10-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803214615/http://texarkanagazette.com/articles/2001/06/24/export15695.txt |archivedate=2003-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written by Earl E. Smith and directed by Charles B. Pierce. The part of Bobby Ford was played by Glenn Carruth and the part of Elizabeth Ford was played by Bunny Dees. Fouke Garage owner Willie E. Smith, on whose land three-toed footprints were found, starred as himself. Many characters were named after the people who played them. Much of the film was shot on location in Fouke and nearby Texarkana, though some scenes also were filmed in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]. Most of the cast were local people or Texarkana college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0068837|The Legend of Boggy Creek (1972)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is believed to have cost $160,000 to make.&lt;ref name="pierce"&gt;{{cite news |title=Charles B.

=== ''Return to Boggy Creek'' (1977) ===
{{main|Return to Boggy Creek}}
A second Fouke Monster film, ''Return to Boggy Creek'', was filmed and released in 1977. The movie had an entirely fictional plot and was not intended to be a sequel. It was directed by [[Tom Moore (director)|Tom Moore]], written by John David Woody, and starred [[Dawn Wells]] as the mother of three children who become lost in the swamp.&lt;ref name="returntobcr1"&gt;{{IMDb title|0078159|Return to Boggy Creek (1977)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the film's scenes were shot on location in [[Dallas, Texas]], and [[Loreauville, Louisiana|Loreauville]] and [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana]].&lt;ref name="returntobcr1" /&gt;

=== ''Boggy Creek II: And The Legend Continues'' (1985) ===
{{main|Boggy Creek II: And the Legend Continues}}
Originally titled ''The Barbaric Beast of Boggy Creek, Part II'', the third Fouke Monster film was written as a sequel to the original film. Charles B. Pierce wrote, directed, and played the role of Brian Lockart, a [[University of Arkansas]] professor who leads a group of students into the swamps around Fouke.&lt;ref name="thebarbt1"&gt;{{IMDb title|0088772|Boggy Creek II: And the Legend Continues (1985)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shot on location in Fouke&lt;ref name="thebarbt1" /&gt; but included some scenes shot at the University of Arkansas.

In 1999, ''Boggy Creek II: And The Legend Continues'' was [[parody|lampooned]] in an episode of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Boggy Creek II: And The Legend Continues... |series=Mystery Science Theater 3000 |network=[[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] |airdate=1999-05-09 |season=10 |number=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Boggy Creek: The Legend Is True'' (2010) ===
''Boggy Creek: The Legend Is True'' was released to home video in 2011. Early buzz suggested that the film, directed by Brian T. Jaynes, was to be a remake of Charles B. Pierce's original 1972 film. However, it is an unrelated story set in the fictional town of Boggy Creek, [[Texas]]. Even so, the film obviously draws influence from Pierce's film with its small-town setting and use of spooky swampscapes for this Southern Sasquatch horror slasher.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1493798|Boggy Creek (2010)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boggycreekthemovie.com/ |title=Boggy Creek - Coming in 2010 |accessdate=2013-03-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208080734/http://boggycreekthemovie.com/ |archivedate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Legacy of Boggy Creek'' (2011) ===
This low-budget [[independent film|indie film]] was originally released in 2009 under the title ''The Skunkape Story'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://horrormoviecentral.weebly.com/1/post/2009/12/my-review-of-the-skunkape-story-2009.html |title=My Review of The Skunkape Story (2009) |last=James |date=2009-12-22 |publisher=horrormoviecentral.weebly.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512202112/http://horrormoviecentral.weebly.com/1/post/2009/12/my-review-of-the-skunkape-story-2009.html |archivedate=2010-05-12 |accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foukemonster.net/movies.htm |title=Fouke Monster: The Beast and the Legend of Boggy Creek: Movies... |publisher=Monstro Bizarro Productions |accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later re-edited and released to home video in 2011 as ''The Legacy of Boggy Creek''. The docudrama chronicles the events that began after the original attacks in Fouke. It was written and directed by Dustin Ferguson.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|2004395|The Legacy of Boggy Creek (Video 2011)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yongamsa Gwaebul.jpg|thumb|Seoul Tangible Cultural Heritage #363, the Bongwonsa Amita Gwaebul, on display during a festival at Yongamsa Temple in Seoul.]]
'''Gwaebul''' (괘불), meaning "Large Buddhist Banner Painting," are extremely large-scale Buddhist scroll paintings found throughout Korea. They are fairly rare, and only 53 were studied between 1986 and 2001. The paintings are typically brought out only rarely for special festivals or holidays such as [[Buddha's Birthday]] or [[Gwaebul Festival]]s when they are unrolled and hung from tall poles in the temple courtyard. When not in use, ''gwaebul'' are stored un a box behind the altar in a temple hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nrich.go.kr/english/page.do?menuIdx=1038|title=RESEARCH ON TRADITIONAL PAINTINGS|last=|first=|date=|website=National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His major works cover [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and the [[Psalms]], and his major interests centered on the oral tradition behind written sources and in folklore.

== Biography ==
Gunkel was born in [[Springe]], [[Kingdom of Hanover]],&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; where his father and grandfather were [[Lutheran]] [[pastor]]s.&lt;ref name=briefhistory&gt;{{cite book | last=Gignilliat | first=Mark S. | title=A Brief History of Old Testament Criticism | year=2012 | publisher=Zondervan | location=Grand Rapids, MI | page=108 | chapter=Hermann Gunkel | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrJln5IwiZ8C&amp;pg=PT108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied at the [[University of Göttingen]] and the [[University of Giessen]]. He eventually taught at both universities in addition to those of [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|Halle]].&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=oFLGroLOKq8C&amp;pg=PA499#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oFLGroLOKq8C | editor-last=McKim | editor-first=Donald K | first=M. J. | last=Buss | chapter=Gunkel, Hermann | title=Dictionary of Major Biblical Interpreters | year=2007 | publisher=InterVarsity Press | pages=499–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunkel started his career in [[New Testament]] studies at [[Göttingen]] in 1888. However, he was soon transferred to [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] (1889-1894) and told to concentrate on the [[Hebrew Bible]] by the Prussian academic appointments authority. He went on to teach in [[Berlin]] (1894-1907), where he made many inter-disciplinary contacts. His 1895 book, ''Creation and Chaos in the Primeval Era and the Eschaton'', compared the symbolism in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12. In 1901, he produced the first of three editions of commentary on Genesis, ''Genesis Translated and Explained''.&lt;ref name=dictionary /&gt;

In 1907, Gunkel finally obtained a full professorship at the [[University of Giessen]]. There he produced the third and final edition of ''Genesis'' in 1910 and ''The Prophets'' in 1917. He moved to the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]] in 1920. He published another standard work, his commentary on the book of [[Psalms]], ''The Psalms: Translated and Explained'' in 1926. ''Introduction to the Psalms'' was his last major project, brought to completion by his student [[Joachim Begrich]] in 1933.&lt;ref name=dictionary /&gt;

Gunkel founded the series ''Research into the Religion and Literature of the Old and New Testaments'' (1903-) with [[Wilhelm Bousset]].&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; He also co-edited with Leopold Zscharnack the second edition of the German religious encyclopedia ''Religion in History and the Present'' (1927-1931), in which he authored over one hundred articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Psalms: A Form-Critical Introduction | url=http://www.ericlevy.com/revel/Psalms/Gunkel%20H%20-%20The%20Psalms%20-%20A%20Form-Critical%20Introduction%20Abridged.PDF | first=James | last=Muilenburg | author-link=James Muilenburg|chapter=Introduction | location=Philadelphia | publisher=Fortress Press | year=1967 | page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunkel became a leading representative of the "[[history of religions school]]" (''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule''), which addressed the history of traditions behind the biblical text. In addition to Gunkel, the original group also included [[Albert Eichhorn]], [[William Wrede]], Heinrich Hackmann, [[Alfred Rahlfs]], [[Johannes Weiss]], [[Wilhelm Bousset]], [[Ernst Troeltsch]], and [[Wilhelm Heitmüller]].&lt;ref name=ludemann&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Gunkel and the school thought that the oral traditions that form the origins of the Hebrew Bible were directly tied to other Near Eastern religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lundström |first=Steven |editor1-last=Scurlock |editor1-first=JoAnn |editor2-last=Beal |editor2-first=Richard H. |

Gunkel arguably produced his most important work in his commentary on [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], published in three editions from 1901 to 1910.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In these works he created the new critical methodology of [[form criticism]] (''Formgeschichte'').&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Muilenburg|first=James| author-link=James Muilenburg|title=Form Criticism and beyond|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|date=March 1969|volume=88|issue=1|pages=1–18|jstor=3262829|doi=10.2307/3262829}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Form criticism examined the genres used in the biblical text to identify the ''[[Sitz im Leben]]'' (setting in life) that produced the text. This approach was based on the assumption that each genre is organically associated with a particular social and historical situation. Nineteenth-century [[source criticism]] had examined the biblical text, especially the [[Pentateuch]], on the basis of style, vocabulary, theology, and other criteria to identify the basic literary sources used to create the text. Form criticism allowed scholars to go behind these larger literary sources by identifying the smaller and older sources used by their authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Form Criticism |url=http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/opr/t94/e693 |work=Oxford Biblical Studies Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its utility, form criticism became immensely influential in Germany and Europe during the 20th century, with important scholars like [[Gerhard von Rad]] and [[Martin Noth]] applying and developing it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

'''''Karloff''''' is a biographical one-man play about the life of film star [[Boris Karloff]], written by Randy Bowser.

Using quotes from Boris Karloff, both humorous and serious, on a wide range of topics, the play is a jigsaw puzzle of brief, non-chronologically enacted events in the actor's life.  The theme is self-realization.  The subject is the art of acting.  The story is how William Henry Pratt,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Boris-Karloff/6000000005250156612|title=Genealogy information for William Henry Pratt AKA Boris Karloff|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose stage name was Boris Karloff, overcomes physical and cultural handicaps to become an unlikely success in his chosen field of acting by making the most of an equally unlikely opportunity when he's cast in the role of a monster. The central metaphor is The Frankenstein Monster trying to grasp light when he first sees it, representing Boris, and all of God's bumbling creatures, trying to reach and understand more than they are capable of comprehending.

The play premiered in [[Salem, Oregon]], November 14, 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karlofftheplay.com/#!publicity-1/c1c74 Rastrelli], Tom Mayhall (2014). "Salem to premiere Boris 'Frankenstein' Karloff play," ''The Statesman Journal'', November 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; at Level B Theater Pub. Boris Karloff's only child, Sara Jane Karloff,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.karloff.com/|title=The Official Boris Karloff Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; attended both performances of the show's opening weekend.  The play was developed with [https://www.facebook.com/stephen.jacobs.94?pnref=friends.search Stephen Jacobs], author of the biography "Boris Karloff: More Than a Monster,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.morethanamonster.co.uk/index.html|title=Boris Karloff: More Than a Monster|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;" as the script's [[Dramaturge|dramaturg]].

Bowser performed the role of Boris in the premiere,&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Carlee (2014). "One-man plays tells of man behind Frankenstein's monster," ''The Statesman Journal'', November 11, [http://www.karlofftheplay.com/#!publicity-2/c1i5g 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; but did not develop the piece as a personal vehicle, but rather as a play open for the general theatre market to all interested producers.  A second production ran during October, 2016, at the Alliance Performance Center of Tucson, AZ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/home-at-last/Content?oid=6071660|title=APCOT opens|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Prokopp played Boris, and the production was directed by John R. Gunn.

The initial production of the play was funded by a successful Kickstarter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/|title=Kickstarter home|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; crowdfunding campaign.

'''Lieven Willemsz van Coppenol''' (1598 – 1667) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] calligrapher best known today for his portraits by [[Rembrandt]].

[[File:Coppenol1.jpg|thumb|A poem by [[Jan Six van Chandelier]] in 1662, written by Coppenol]]
He became a French schoolmaster and lived in [[Haarlem]] in the Koningsstraat under the "Crowned Pen" in 1617.&lt;ref name=NNBW&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/molh003nieu07_01/molh003nieu07_01_0627.php Lieven Willemsz van Coppenol] in the [[NNBW]]&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to the Begijnestraat behind the [[St. Bavochurch]] by the clock tower in 1624.&lt;ref name=NNBW/&gt; By 1628 he had moved to Amsterdam where he ran a school in 1628 called ‘In den Hertog van Saxen', near the 'Jan Roodenpoortstoren’.&lt;ref name=NNBW/&gt; He married for the second time as a widower on 19 June 1644 in Amsterdam to Grietje Andries.&lt;ref name=NNBW/&gt;
He had several poems written in his honor, presumably as a return favor for writing the poems of poets on wall decorations and engraved plates. Several of his writing examples have been preserved. His "schoonschrift" as calligraphy was called was recorded for various objects, most notably a poem in the Amsterdam town hall that was written by Cornelia Pluvier, a poet married to the still-life painter [[Willem Kalf]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/huyg001jawo07_01/huyg001jawo07_01_0599.php Letter by Constantijn Huyghens] in the [[Digital Library for Dutch Literature]]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides teaching, he travelled to clients to sell his work, pulling a hand cart with writing examples for inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/aa__001biog04_01/aa__001biog04_01_0968.php Lieven Willemsz van Coppenol] in [[Van der Aa]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Coppenol died in [[Amsterdam]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3555">Prof. '''Maxine Deirdre Molyneux''' {{Post-nominals}} (born 24 May 1948 in [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]]) is a [[sociologist]] whose work focuses on the [[women's movement]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Who's Who|surname = Molyneux|othernames = Prof. Maxine Deirdre|id = U258145|type = is|volume = 2014|accessed = 2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That women's interests and gender interests are different categories is the discovery for which Maxine Molyneux is most frequently cited. Her focus is women's movements, and her central question is how they and the state influence each other. Interests and law are the categories under which she examines the changeable and shapeable relationship of the gender order and the state. She wants to bring back the state and the political subject into the thinking on modernisation, democratisation and development.

Molyneux studied sociology at the University of Essex and is now Professor of Sociology and Director of the Institute of the Americas, University College London. Her research, as well the influential distinction between gender needs and interests, deals with such subjects as society and development, poverty and social inequality, and gender and politics in Latin America. She is also a consultant to several United Nations organisations, as well as to [[Oxfam]] and other [[NGO]]s. As co-founder in 1979 of the noted magazine ''[[Feminist Review]]'' and an editor of the magazine ''[[Economy and Society]]'', she is involved in the further development of debates on theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Maxine Molyneux {{!}} Staff {{!}} About UNRISD {{!}} UNRISD|url = http://www.unrisd.org/unrisd/website/people.nsf/(httpPeople)/38AC57F4DFF11E47C1256B9F002F5140?OpenDocument|website = www.unrisd.org|accessdate = 2015-06-22|last = UNRISD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Military brat'''" and various "brat" derivatives{{Cref2|a}} describe the child of a parent or parents serving full-time in the [[United States Armed Forces]] and can also refer to the [[subculture]] and [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] of such families.&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wertsch | first = Mary Edwards | authorlink = Mary Edwards Wertsch | title = Military Brats: Legacies of Childhood Inside the Fortress | edition = 1st hardcover | date = April 23, 1991 | publisher = Harmony | isbn = 0-517-58400-X | page = 350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bojh"&gt;Musil, Donna (director, writer, producer); Goodwin, Beth (producer); Kristofferson, Kris (narrator). ''Brats: Our Journey Home''. (DVD video documentary). 90 min. Brats Without Borders, 2006. {{ISBN|0-9774907-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to both current and former children of such families.&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"/&gt;

The military brat lifestyle typically involves moving to new states or countries many times while growing up, as the child's military family is customarily transferred to new non-combat assignments; consequently, many military brats never have a home town.&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p247"&gt;Wertsch (1991), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; War-related family stresses are also a commonly occurring part of military brat life.&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt; There are also other aspects of military brat life that are significantly different in comparison to the civilian American population, often including living in foreign countries and or  diverse regions within the U.S., exposure to foreign languages and cultures, and [[Military sociology|immersion in military culture]].&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hawkins, John P. "Army of Hope, Army of Alienation: Culture and Contradiction in the American Army Communities of Cold War Germany" [Hardcover]&lt;/ref&gt;

The military brats [[subculture]] has emerged over the last 200 years.&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt; The age of the phenomenon has meant military brats have also been described by a number of researchers as one of America's oldest and yet least well-known and largely invisible subcultures.&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="morton"&gt;Ender, Morton, "Military Brats and Other Global Nomads", March 2002, Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-0-275-97266-0}}, {{ISBN|0-275-97266-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been described as a "modern [[nomad]]ic subculture".&lt;ref name="morton" /&gt;

"Military brat" is known in [[Military sociology|U.S. military culture]] as a term of endearment and respect.&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bojh"/&gt; The term may also connote a military brat's experience of mobile upbringing,&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bojh"/&gt; and may reference a sense of worldliness.&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bojh"/&gt; Research has shown that most current and former military brats like the term; however, outside of the military world, the term "military brat" can sometimes be misunderstood by the non-military population, where the word "brat" is often a pejorative term.&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p4"&gt;Wertsch (1991), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary features of lifestyle and culture==
[[Image:Military-brat-prepares-for-yet-another-move-military-photo-number-101227.jpg|thumb|right|Photo from US Army guide on moving, written for military families. Military brats move an average of 10 times while growing up; some have moved as many as 36 times,&lt;ref name="bojh"/&gt; often thousands of miles in distance, including spending years overseas.&lt;ref name="bojh"/&gt;'' '']]

Studies show that this group is shaped by several forces. A major influence is the fact of frequent moves, as the family follows the military member-parent (or in some cases, both parents who are military members) who is transferred from military base to military base, each move usually being hundreds or thousands of miles in distance. Other shaping forces include a culture of resilience and adaptivity, constant loss of friendship ties, a facility or knack for making new friends, never having a hometown, and extensive exposure to foreign cultures and languages while living overseas or to a wide range of regional cultural differences due to living in a variety of different American regions. Additional influences include living in a series of military bases serving as community centers, the pervasive military culture on those bases, the absence of a parent due to deployments, the threat of parental loss in [[war]], stresses associated with the psychological aftermath of war (living with war-affected returning veteran parents) and the militarization of the family unit (children being treated to some degree like soldiers and being subjected to military regimentation, inculcation into a warrior code of honor and service, frequent exposure to patriotic ideas and symbols, experience of free medical care, and military discipline).&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="morton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;Britten, Samuel L. (June 17, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Military brats receives [[Tricare]] until they reach the age of 23 or age 25 (If Tricare Young Adult is purchased).&lt;ref name="tricare-young-adult-program"/&gt;

While some non-military families may share some of these same attributes and experiences, military culture has a much higher incidence and concentration of these issues and experiences in military families as compared to civilian populations, and by tightly-knit military communities that perceive these experiences as normal. Studies show that growing up immersed in military culture can have long-lasting effects on children, both in positive and also some negative ways.&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt;

===Life on base===
[[Image:Amarillo Air Force Base - Front Gate - Postcard.jpg|thumb|right|Base gate and checkpoint at the since-closed [[Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport#Amarillo Air Force Base (1951-68)|Amarillo AFB]]. Life inside of military bases differs significantly from the civilian world, giving many military brats a feeling of difference from civilian culture.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 1991"/&gt;]]

Military bases are often small cities with 10,000 or more people, and are self-contained worlds where military culture is primary and [[civilian]] culture is secondary.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 1991"&gt;Wertsch (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Military families do not always live on base, but often do.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 1991"/&gt; Military towns, the areas immediately surrounding a base, are also often highly influenced by military culture.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 1991"/&gt; While the general public uses the term "base" to refer any military installation, within the US military the term "base" primarily applies to Air Force or Navy installations while Army installations are called "posts."

Military brats grow up moving from base to base as they follow their parent or parents to new assignments.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 1991"/&gt; Sometimes living on base, sometimes off, the base in both cases is often the center of military brat life, where shopping, recreation, schools and the military community form a string of temporary towns for military brats as they grow up.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 1991"/&gt;

[[Image:US Navy 020813-N-3235P-520 shopping at the commissary.jpg|left|thumb|Two military brats shopping at the [[Defense Commissary Agency|commissary]], located in the military base. Bases are often self-contained towns, with shopping, schools, hospitals, recreation centers, movie theaters, etc.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 1991"/&gt;]]

Studies show that the culture on military bases is perceived by most current and former military brats as significantly different from civilian culture.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 1991"/&gt; It is widely experienced as being pervaded by military cultural norms and expectations, as well as the presence of military police or their other military security forces equivalents, armed guards, high security zones and some degree of surveillance. Some bases also contain unique features, such as air bases with numerous aircraft and attendant noise, or seaports with large numbers of naval vessels. Balancing this are extensive areas which are more relaxed in character, for on-base housing, shopping, dining, recreation, sports and entertainment, as well as base chapels which host diverse religious services.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 1991"/&gt; However, military regulations, laws and social codes of conduct are in force throughout the base, which can be very different from local, state or national laws, regulations and customs.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 1991"/&gt;

Military language also has differences from standard American English and is often peppered with [[military slang]] and [[List of U.S. government and military acronyms|military acronyms]].&lt;ref name="Wertsch 1991"/&gt; There are many words and phrases that are unique to the military world and which make up a part of everyday conversation on bases.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 1991"/&gt; For example, time is measured in 24-hour rather than 12-hour segments as in the civilian world, and distances, primarily on stateside Army bases or on many U.S. bases of all services overseas, often described in meters and kilometers (or "Clicks" in military slang) instead of yards or miles.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 1991"/&gt; Consequently, many military brats report feelings of cultural identity that have a military flavor and a feeling of difference from local civilian culture, even on bases in the United States.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 1991"/&gt; These feelings of difference can also be made more complex by virtue of having absorbed varying degrees of overseas cultures and also different regional American cultures while living in different places as a part of the military brat lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 1991"/&gt;

Bases do form communities, but due to most of them experiencing frequent 100% turnover in just a few years, an adult military brat can never return and find old friends, neighbors or even former teachers, on bases where they grew up. Base schools usually have an even higher turnover rate, reaching 100% turnover in as little as 2 years.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 1991"/&gt; Due to revocation of base privileges upon reaching the age of 18 (or 23 if one attends college), access to bases to reminisce or reconnect with one's places of growing up can also be difficult.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 1991"/&gt;

===Size of population===
Although no exact figures are available, the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] estimates that approximately 15 million Americans are former or current military brats, including those who spent all or part of their childhood and/or adolescence in the lifestyle.&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt; This population includes an age range from less than 1 years old to over 90 years of age, since there have been military brats for generations.&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt; Many military brats spent all of their growing up years in the active lifestyle, some for only part, although military family issues, dynamics and influences may continue nevertheless. Also, not all military brats grow up moving all the time, although many do.

==Studies==
Military brats have been studied extensively, both from the perspective of [[social psychology]] and as a distinct and unique American subculture, although less so in terms of long-term impact of the lifestyle. There are also some gaps in studies of more recent (post-[[Cold War]]-era) military brats. Collectively these studies paint a fairly consistent picture of how the lifestyle tends to influence the population (on average) in various aspects of life. These studies look at overall patterns and individual experiences may vary widely:

===Positive patterns in overall study results===
Some strong positives that have been identified in studies of military brat populations are a high occurrence of very resilient personalities, exceptional social skills, a high level of multicultural or international awareness, proficiency in foreign languages, and a statistically very strong affinity for careers that entail service to others.&lt;ref name="morton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p385, 386"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that ex-military kids end up pursuing service-related careers in very high numbers: military service, teaching, counseling, police, nursing and foreign service work being highly represented in military brat career statistics (in comparison to statistics on non-military brat patterns of employment choices).&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="morton" /&gt; [[Mary Edwards Wertsch]] also identified a pattern (for those military brats who do not choose military service) of work that is more independent (self-employment / avoidance of direct subservience to authority figures) and along those lines also favoring creative and artistic professions that offer more independence.&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"/&gt; She also reported that for those military brats who did choose military service there was a tendency to go through a phase of bucking or testing authority during military service, or a pattern of resenting authority, represented in her study population.&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"/&gt; However, military brats who become soldiers also tend to do well overall in the profession.&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"/&gt;

As adults, military brats can share many of the same positive and negative traits identified in other populations that experienced very mobile childhoods. Having had the opportunity to live around the world, military brats can have a breadth of experiences unmatched by most teenagers.&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt; Regardless of race, religion, nationality, or gender, brats might identify more with other highly mobile children than with non-mobile ones.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Rudi (2001) and also Williams (2002) p 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Military brats also graduate from college at a higher rate than the civilian population and divorce at a lower rate.&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt;

===Negative patterns in overall study results===

On the negative side, studies show that some former military brats struggle to develop and maintain deep, lasting relationships, and can feel like outsiders to U.S. civilian culture.&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt; The transitory lifestyle can hinder potential for constructing concrete relationships with people and developing emotional attachments to specific places,&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt; as can the stresses of having a parent deployed to a war zone and also the psychological aftermath of war in dealing with returning veteran parents.&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt; In some cases there is also the loss of a parent in combat, or a drastic change in a parent due to a combat related disability.&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt; A military brat may personally know another child or teenager, or even a few other peers, whose parents have become war casualties (wounded or killed). A significant minority of ex-military brats may exhibit symptoms of [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]], [[Avoidant Personality Disorder]], [[Separation Anxiety Disorder]], etc.&lt;ref name=Wertsch&gt;Wertsch, Mary Edwards (April 23, 1991). ''Military Brats: Legacies of Childhood Inside the Fortress'' (1st hardcover edition). Harmony. {{ISBN|0-517-58400-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific study areas==

===Mobile lifestyle preferences===

Although neither a clearly negative or positive trait, studies also show that many adult military brats report difficulty settling down in one geographic location and also report a desire to move (relocate) every few years; many adult military brats call this "the itch".&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wertsch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jordan&gt;Jordan, Kathleen Finn (2002). "Identity Formation and the Adult Third Culture Kid" in Morten Ender (ed.), ''Military Brats and Other Global Nomads: Growing Up in Organization Families'', Westport, Connecticut: Praeger. {{ISBN|0-275-97266-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some adult military brats report the opposite tendency and relate refusing any and all pressures from spouses or employers to ever move again.&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wertsch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jordan/&gt;

===Perfectionist tendencies===

Many former military brats report struggling at some point in their lives with issues related to [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]] and learning how to let go in areas of personal performance (perhaps due to the demanding nature of military culture).&lt;ref name="Wertsch-p350"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="morton" /&gt; Paradoxically, a majority of those very same military brats who report having struggled with perfectionism and performance control issues also describe themselves as being successful in their lives, indicating a resilience that also surfaces in overcoming or learning to manage those issues in the long run.&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt;

===Adaptability and outsider feelings===

Overall a majority of military brats report having developed a kind of extra-adaptability and assimilate into new situations quickly and well, as they have done with each move to a new military base, town or country.&lt;ref name=Wertsch/&gt; Yet paradoxically, long-term feelings of being an outsider in relation to civilian (non-military) culture are common to a majority of military brats.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2002), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one major study shows that 32% of military brats feel as if they are only spectators on U.S. life, and another 48% do not feel as if they are central to any group.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Military culture==
A significant percentage of military brats report difficulty in forming strong relations with people or places, but very often do form strong connections with (or in some cases aversion to) the notion of a military base and the communities in which they find themselves.&lt;ref name="incengine1"&gt;Benson, John PhD (2004). [http://www.incengine.org/incEngine/sites/figt/information/emplace_lives_summ.htm "Emplacing Our Lives: Executive Study"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008035156/http://www.incengine.org/incEngine/sites/figt/information/emplace_lives_summ.htm |date=2007-10-08 }} Presentation at the FIGT 2004 Conference. Retrieved December 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the knowledge, experience, values, ideas, attitudes, skills, tastes, and techniques that are associated with the military can sometimes differ from civilian culture.&lt;ref name="OMK4"&gt;[http://www.k12.wa.us/OperationMilitaryKids/TrainingManual/Chapter_4_Final.pdf Operation Military Kids: Chapter Four Exploring our Military Culture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060309142023/http://www.k12.wa.us/OperationMilitaryKids/TrainingManual/Chapter_4_Final.pdf |date=2006-03-09 }} p 3–4. Retrieved on January 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Military base]]s are miniature, self-contained, government-[[subsidized]] towns that promote conformity.&lt;ref&gt;Wertsch (1991), p 34. "A 'good' military family is one that demonstrates in all things its submission to the ways of the Fortress. It is conventional. It is predictable. It conforms in appearance and behavior to what the Fortress expects. It obeys authority. It displays to the world what ought to be displayed. And it conceals the rest".&lt;/ref&gt; Military families shop at some of the same stores, whose discounted merchandise is regulated to prevent unfair competition, so they can often end up with the same clothes and products.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Lydia Sloan, (1995) ''Today's Military Wife: Meeting the Challenges of Service Life,'' Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books. {{ISBN|0-8117-2580-4}} p 26–30&lt;/ref&gt; Male brats were, at one time, likely to get the same "military haircut" at the base barbershop, but this has changed over time. To a child growing up on a military base, in a homogeneous culture, the individuality of civilian life was once thought to be completely foreign. However, as the individual children have attended civilian schools near base and socialized with their peers, this perceived difference may have reduced to varying degrees.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Values and patriotism===
[[Image:US Navy 040601-N-4995T-077 Battalion Commander Cadet Ensign Melanie Leonard, of Radford High School Junior ROTC, salutes during the parading of the colors ceremony held at the Parchee Memorial Submarine Base at this year's Memo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Admiral Arthur W. Radford High School|Radford High School]] ROTC student salutes during colors ceremony.  The public school is located one mile from a U.S. naval base.  62% of its students are military dependents, also called "military brats", resulting in a yearly transiency rate of about one third.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.k12.hi.us/~radfordrams/files/about/main.htm About Radford High School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530002856/http://www2.k12.hi.us/~radfordrams/files/about/main.htm |date=2011-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Patriotism]] may come to mean different things for different ex-military brats, but nevertheless figures strongly in the upbringing, language and thinking of many who grew up in military families. The comfort, or sense of restriction, (or both) that can be found on military bases is not limited to the physical trappings, but can be fortified via some of the consistent [[ritual]]s common to them. When moving around the world, these rituals can help brats feel at home in their new community. Even though the faces and geography change, the "base" can remain recognizable because the rituals are often uniform. The underlying principle of these rituals is consistent: to promote patriotism.&lt;ref name="incengine1"/&gt;

It has been claimed by Samuel Britten on the basis of anecdotal evidence that life on military bases is associated with comparatively greater patriotic sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;Britten, Samuel (November 30, 1998) [https://web.archive.org/web/20061119025737/http://www.tckworld.com/comparisons.html "TCK World: A Comparison of Different "Versions" Of TCKs"] Third Culture Kid World. Retrieved December 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, honoring the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] is expected. At the end of the business day, on a military installation, the bugle call "[[To the Color]]" is played while the flag is lowered.&lt;ref&gt;Truscott (1989) p 12. "We all stopped, no matter what we were doing. And no matter where we were, no matter what foxhole we were hiding in,&amp;nbsp;... we stopped. "Retreat" would blare out from the loudspeakers all over the base. We could never see the flag; it was miles away. But we knew where it was, and like facing [[Mecca]], everyone turned around and puts their hand over their heart, and stood there until the music stopped.... There was never even a comment about it, no matter what was going on. It just happened everyday."&lt;/ref&gt; While no longer universal, formerly anybody outside, even if participating in sports or driving a car, was expected to stop their activity and stand at attention.&lt;ref&gt;Bonn (2005) p 31. "Whenever and wherever the '[[The Star-Spangled Banner|National Anthem']], 'To the Colors,' or '[[Hail to the Chief]]' is played outdoors, at the first note, all dismounted personnel in uniform and not in formation, within saluting distance of the flag, face the flag, or the music if the flag is not in view, salute, and maintain the salute until the last note of the music is sounded... Vehicles in motion are brought to a halt. Persons riding in a passenger car or on a motorcycle dismount and salute."&lt;/ref&gt; Uniformed personnel salute and non-uniformed people place their hand over their heart.

Until recently,{{when|date=October 2018}} the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] was recited every morning, and patriotic and militaristic songs may have been sung at [[Department of Defense Dependents Schools]] (DoDDS) overseas and Department of Defense Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS) within the United States. Patriotic ideals often form the basis for [[Christian Church|church]] [[sermon]]s. [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] worship services may include militaristic [[hymn]]s. Prior to movies at base theaters, patrons and staff stand for the National Anthem and often another patriotic song, such as "[[God Bless the USA]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wertsch (1991), pp. 2–4. Such as "The Son of God Goes Forth to War," "Fight the Good Fight with All Thy Might," "Marching with Heroes," "Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me," "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]," and "[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

The military family knows that the service person may be killed in the line of duty, but may accept that risk because they understand the values of duty, honor, and country. The mission is one in which the brat shares by extension through his military parent.&lt;ref name="Issues 2"&gt;Williams (2002) p 69. "Military culture is organized according to rank, military specialty, unit membership, branch of service, and residence… all of which affects the identity formation of a child growing up in a military family."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uniform Code of Military Justice|Military law]] requires [[commanding officer]]s and those in authority to demonstrate [[virtue]], [[honor]], patriotism, and [[subordination (trait)|subordination]] in all that they do.&lt;ref&gt;Title 10 of the US Code Section 3583 "Requirement for Exemplary Conduct" in Bonn (2005) p 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the army officially adopted what have come to be known as "The 7 Army Values", which are summarized with the acronym "[[LDRSHIP]]". LDRSHIP stands for Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage. While this acronym is relatively new, the ideas it represents have been at the heart of military service for generations. Similarly, the motto "Duty, honor, country" is the standard of the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Duty, honor, country|Speech by Douglas MacArthur.]] Wikisource, Retrieved December 3, 2006 and Bonn (2005) p 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Military brats are raised in a culture that stresses LDRSHIP, Duty, Honor, and Country. Their strict (outward) adherence to military values is what separates most from their civilian peers. Children of military personnel often mirror the values, ideals, and attitudes of their parents more than children of civilians.&lt;ref name="Watanabe106"&gt;Watanabe (1985) p 106&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] General [[Peter Pace]], the Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], said in a 2006 interview, "There's no way, in my mind, that you can be successful in the military and have a family unless that family does, in fact, appreciate your service to the country."&lt;ref name="Sacrifice"&gt;Wood, Sgt.

===Discipline===
The stereotypical military family might have had a "duty roster" on the refrigerator, parent-conducted room inspections, and children who say "yes sir/ma'am" to adults.&lt;ref&gt;Wertsch (1991), p 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Eighty percent of Cold War-era brats described their father as "authoritarian" or desiring to exercise complete control over their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Truscott (1989) p 106–107. "Disciplinary [[tactic (method)|tactics]] that are now considered [[physical abuse|abusive]] were a matter of parental prerogative for many years in both military and civilian families. Family discipline was a personal matter, to be handled behind the closed doors of the neat rows of houses on military posts, but the implication that fathers who fit into the orderly world of the military should be able to control small children was clear."&lt;/ref&gt; They described their military parent as rigid in discipline, inflexible, intolerant of dissent, disapproving of non-conforming behavior, insensitive to their emotions, and not accepting of personal privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Wertsch (1991), pp. 10–23&lt;/ref&gt; A Cold War era military [[psychologist]], publishing in the ''[[American Journal of Psychology]]'', reviewed the parents of patients who came to his clinic, and concluded that 93% of patients came from military families that were overly authoritarian.&lt;ref&gt;Wertsch (1991), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disciplinary expectations extend beyond the military family. Family members know that their actions and behavior can have a direct impact on the military service member's career.&lt;ref name = "career"&gt;Wertsch (1991), p. 30. Truscott (1989), p. 107. "Military brats were aware that their behavior or misbehavior was a direct reflection on their parents, and specifically on their fathers".&lt;/ref&gt; The consequences of misbehavior for a military brat are generally greater than for civilian children. A military person's career and [[social identity]] can be dashed in seconds by a willful or careless child.&lt;ref name="Wertsch3132"&gt;Wertsch (1991), pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when a military brat gets in trouble, the authorities may call the parent's [[Commanding Officer]] or the [[base commander|Base Commander]] before, or instead of, calling the brat's parents.&lt;ref&gt;Wertsch (1991), p 31. Wertsch records numerous examples of this occurring in her book. Two of the more egregious examples: A "teenage boy committed the unpardonable sin of teeing off on the golf course at 5:00 p.m., while [[Sunset (bugle call)|Retreat]] was being blown, instead of standing respectfully at attention as the base's flag was lowered for the day. An officer reported him, and his father got a call from high up in the base hierarchy. The incident went down on the father's permanent record. The same thing happens to another father whose twelve-year-old son knocked over a trash can in front of the base teen club. The son was picked up by the military police, who called not the father, but the father's commanding officer." Wertsch also describes a child who was misbehaving at the Base Exchange. An adult the child did not know recognized him and contacted the child's parents.&lt;/ref&gt; If the commanding officer or base commander is contacted, the brat's behavior may become a part of the military member's [[service record|record]], and adversely affect his or her ability to be promoted or the duty assignments (particularly overseas) that lead to advancement.&lt;ref&gt;Wertsch (1991), p. 28. Prior to 1987, Commanding Officers were required to comment on an army officer's spouse on the officer's annual evaluation. Even though the spaces for spousal review were removed in 1987, "there is widespread feeling that a spouse's conduct is still taken into consideration and may influence a service member's career." Spouses were evaluated on how well behaved their children were and how clean they maintained their houses.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research into military brats has consistently shown them to be better behaved than their civilian counterparts.&lt;ref name="Watanabe106" /&gt; Sociologist Phoebe Price posed three possible hypotheses as to why brats are better behaved: firstly, military parents have a lower threshold for misbehavior in their children; secondly, the [[Social mobility|mobility]] of [[teenagers]] might make them less likely to attract attention to themselves, as many want to fit in and are less secure with their surroundings; and thirdly, normative constraints are greater, with brats knowing that their behavior is under scrutiny and can affect the military member's career.&lt;ref&gt;Price (2002) p 44–45. Price also noted previous studies that showed that military brats had "a lower level of some childhood disorders such as [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD.)"&lt;/ref&gt;

Teenage years are typically a period when people establish independence by taking some risks away from their parents. When the teenager lives in a "fish-bowl community," a small self-contained community such as a base, challenging boundaries may be more difficult. Brats know that misbehavior or rebellious activity will be reported to their parents.&lt;ref name = "eakin 25"&gt;Eakin (1998) p 25&lt;/ref&gt; Brats are sometimes under constant pressure to conform to what military culture expects; this means they are sometimes seen as being more mature in their youth than their peers. If they grow up overseas or on military bases, they might have limited opportunities to see a wide range of role models in different professions.&lt;ref name="Eakin1"&gt;Eakin (1998) p 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Strict discipline can have the opposite effect: brats may rebel or behave in adolescent manners well beyond what is normally considered acceptable.&lt;ref name="Cottrell1993"&gt;Cottrell, Ann and Ruth Hill Useem (1993). [http://www.tckworld.com/useem/art3.html TCKs Experience Prolonged Adolescence]. ''International Schools Services, 8(1)'.' Retrieved January 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Others develop psychological problems due to the intense stress of always being on their best behavior.&lt;ref name="Wertsch3132" /&gt;

===Military classism===

Military life is strictly [[Geographical segregation|segregated]] by [[Military rank|rank]];&lt;ref name = "protocol"&gt;Cline (1995) p 82. "Protocol is not intended to promote snobbery; it is a courtesy designed to recognize official status and give respect to those who, by their achievements, time in service, and experience, deserve it. And the exercise of that most certainly extends to spouses."&lt;/ref&gt; the facilities provided for officers and enlisted personnel differ dramatically. The officers' housing will generally be more accessible to base activities, larger in size, and better [[landscape architecture|landscaped]]. On larger bases, the officers' housing may be broken down into different categories, with senior officers receiving larger and more opulent housing; sometimes, the highest-ranking officers live in a row of large houses often referred to as "Colonels'/Captains' Row" or "Generals'/Admirals' Row," as the case may be.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The Officer Clubs are more elegant than the Enlisted Clubs. Officers have cleaner, more elaborate recreational facilities than their enlisted counterparts. Historically, base [[chapel]]s and movie theaters would have designated seating for officers and their families. For a part of the 20th century, some bases had two [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]] and two [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scout]] troops—one for officer children and one for enlisted children.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 290"&gt;Wertsch (1991), p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

These differences are not merely external, but a core aspect of military life.&lt;ref name="Wertsch 290" /&gt; Children of enlisted personnel often believe that children of officers receive specialized treatment because non-officers are afraid to upset the officers.&lt;ref&gt;Wertsch (1991), p 297. One interviewee said "You could always tell the son of the [Commanding Officer]. He was the [[American football|football]] star, he had good grades."&lt;/ref&gt; The physical separation and differences between available activities make it very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Truscott (1989) p 168. "Privileges accorded by rank were highly visible... And all military brats, no matter where their father had fit in the hierarchy of rank, emphasized, over and over, that rank was pervasive and clearly defined."&lt;/ref&gt; Most military brats on a personal level do not let this affect their social interactions, and in most cases it is frowned upon to treat others by their parent's pay grade or rank.

The separation by rank has the intended purpose of maintaining military discipline among service members. According to the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice, it can be illegal for an officer to [[fraternize]] with an enlisted person because it would erode the military hierarchy. This is often conveyed to the children of military personnel. Two brats whose parents have a subordinate-supervisory relationship can cause problems for both their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Wertsch (1991), pp. 285–288.&lt;/ref&gt;

To a lesser degree, military classism also includes the branch of service to which the military parent belongs. If asked to name "the best branch of service," military brats will almost invariably name the one to which their parent belonged. They will be able to articulate many reasons why "their" branch of the service is the best. These biases are maintained well past the time they cease to be [[military dependent]]s. When brats grow up, these boundaries are replaced by a shared identity based upon that of being a military brat.&lt;ref&gt;Wertsch (1991), pp. 314–315.&lt;/ref&gt;

While a class hierarchy is reflected in stratified housing structures, military classism differs from traditional class structures in some significant ways – namely, schooling and access to quality healthcare. Children of military personnel attend the same base schools regardless of rank, creating peer cultures that are usually not class-based, and providing equal access to educational resources. Similarly, all military personnel receive the same quality of healthcare by the same providers.

===Anti-racism===
In 1948, nearly 20 years before the [[civil rights movement]] swept through the non-military segments of U.S. society, President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] signed [[Executive Order 9981]] integrating the military and mandating equality of treatment and opportunity. It outlawed segregation in the military and made it illegal, per military law, to make a [[racism|racist]] remark.&lt;ref name="bojh"/&gt; Fifteen years later, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] issued Department of Defense [[Directive 5120.36]]. "Every military commander," the Directive mandates, "has the responsibility to oppose discriminatory practices affecting his men and their dependents and to foster equal opportunity for them, not only in areas under his immediate control, but also in nearby communities where they may gather in off-duty hours."&lt;ref&gt;Department of Defense Directive 5120.36&lt;/ref&gt; The directive was issued in 1963, but it was not until 1967 that the first non-military installation was declared off-limits to military personnel due to its discriminatory practices.&lt;ref&gt;Antecol, Heather and Deborah Cobb-Clark, [http://www.economics.ucr.edu/seminars/spring06/ped/HeatherAntecol5-1-2006.pdf Racial and Ethnic Harassment in Local Communities.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830080558/http://www.economics.ucr.edu/seminars/spring06/ped/HeatherAntecol5-1-2006.pdf |date=2006-08-30 }} Oct 4, 2005. p 8. Retrieved on January 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While these directives did not eliminate all racism in the military, they continue to affect the culture in which children of military personnel grow up.&lt;ref name="bojh"/&gt;

When families go overseas, minority students rarely experience overt racism from their [[expatriate]] neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Eakin (1998) p 56&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true on military bases within the U.S.; as the diverse and more integrated military base community is isolated from the off-base community, and seen as the primary community, outside communities being secondary, military dependents are less likely to resort to racist notions. The bonds of the military community are normally seen by military dependents as being stronger bonds than the differences of race. Military brats grow up in a setting that actively condemns racist comments. This results in brats who "aren't just non-racist, but anti-racist."{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A typical military school can experience up to 50% turnover every year (25% [[graduation|graduate]] while a third of the remaining 75% of students move); social groups that existed one year cease to exist as new groups emerge. The brat learns to adapt quickly to fit into this ever-changing environment. Highly mobile children are more likely to reach out to a new student, because they know what it is like to be the new student.&lt;ref name="Coming Home"&gt;Eakin (U.S. Dept of State)&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies show that, although brats move on average every 3 years, they do not grow accustomed to moving.&lt;ref&gt;Ender (1996) p 131. "Towards the end of the Cold War, approximately 9% of enlisted soldiers and 31% of officers with more than fourteen years of service reported having moved with their spouse and/or children more than nine times."&lt;/ref&gt; The constantly changing environment and openness to others has a price. Rather than develop problem-solving skills, there is a temptation to simply leave a problem without resolving it.&lt;ref name="Eakin1"/&gt; If a person does not like somebody or gets into a fight, they know that in a few years somebody will move and the problem will disappear.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} On the other hand, when brats marry it is generally{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} for life; over two thirds of brats over 40 are married to their first spouse.&lt;ref name="stats" /&gt; Studies show that many brats become very adaptable as a result of the mobile lifestyle, But there is also a higher than average incidence, among a minority of military brats, of [[Avoidant Personality Disorder]] and [[Separation Anxiety Disorder]].

[[Social group]]s become even more difficult to break into, and activities that the student enjoyed may be barred to him or her. For example, an athlete may not be able to join his or her sport because they missed tryouts and the season had already begun. A student who excelled at their old [[Department of Defense Dependents Schools|DoDDS]] or [[Department of Defense Education Activity|DDESS]] school suddenly feels inadequate at the larger school.&lt;ref name="Eakin2"&gt;Eakin (1998) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies, however, show that mobility during the school year may be less traumatic than summertime moves.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler (2002) p 27. "Despite the commonly held belief that summer moves are best for children, teens who moved during summer vacation seemed to experience particular difficulties… Their problem was that, with school out of session, it was very difficult to identify potential friends and begin to form relationships."&lt;/ref&gt;

DoDDS schools overseas and DDESS schools in the United States tend to be smaller than many public schools. Students and teachers often interact in a more social manner with one another. When returning to civilian schools, the lack of camaraderie with the faculty can be an unexpected obstacle for many highly mobile families.&lt;ref name="Eakin2"/&gt;

Military brats have lower [[juvenile delinquency|delinquency]] rates, higher achievement scores on [[standardized test]]s, and higher median [[IQ]]s than their civilian counterparts.&lt;ref name="Issues"&gt;Williams (2002) p 68&lt;/ref&gt; They are more likely to have a college degree (60% v 24%) and possess an advanced degree (29.1% v 5%).&lt;ref name="Issues" /&gt; While these rates are higher than the general U.S. population, they are lower than those of other non-brat [[third culture kid]]s (84–90% college degree and 40% graduate degree).&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;Ender (2002) p 88–90&lt;/ref&gt; United States military brats are the most mobile of the "third culture kids", moving on average every three years.

===Range of international experience and influences===

Sociologist Morten Ender conducted the largest scientific study to date exclusively on career military brats (those who had at least one parent in the military from birth through high school). He interviewed and sent questionnaires to over 600 brats who belonged to various brat organizations and responded to his newspaper and internet ads. His study revealed that 97% lived in at least one foreign country, 63% in two, 31% in three. They averaged eight moves before graduating from high school and spent an average of seven years in foreign countries. Over 80% now speak at least one language other than English, and 14% speak three or more.&lt;ref name="stats" /&gt; Ann Cottrell's work with third culture kids, however, shows slightly lower results, but her results did not specify career brats.&lt;ref&gt;Cottrell (2002) p 231. Likewise, an online survey at Militarybrat.com shows slightly lower results than Ender's study, but again Ender's analysis is of brats who spent their entire childhood in the military environment.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Henry Watanabe showed that military and civilian teenagers share the same concerns and desires, but that growing up in a mobile community offers opportunities and experiences generally unavailable to geographically stable families.&lt;ref name="Watanabe106" /&gt; A sociological study of overseas American military communities in Cold War [[Germany]] also showed some transformational effects on those communities due to foreign exposure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Abuse and alcoholism===
Two of the common themes in Wertsch's book are [[abuse]] and [[alcoholism]]. These are echoed in other literature of the Cold War, such as [[Pat Conroy]]'s ''[[The Great Santini (novel)|The Great Santini]]''. In the 1980s and 1990s the U.S. military focused on the issues of abuse and alcoholism. The impact on the military's efforts remains inconclusive. Some studies report higher rates of abuse in military families, while others report lower rates.&lt;ref name = "rentz" /&gt;

The studies that conclude abuse is a bigger problem in military families than civilian families attribute this to the long hours, frequent disruptions in lifestyles, and high degree of stress. They point out that military families may be more reluctant to report issues of abuse because of the potential impact on the service member's career. Other studies, however, argue that military families have a smaller problem than civilian families because military culture offers more accessible help for victims of abuse. Military families have health care, housing, and family support programs often unavailable to lower income civilian families. Abusive family members are more likely to be ordered (by their commanding officer or base commander) to obtain treatment, thus reducing reoccurrences of abuse.&lt;ref name = "rentz"&gt;Rentz ED, Martin SL, Gibbs DA, et al. "Family Violence in the Military: A review of the Literature." ''Trauma Violence, and Abuse.'' 2006 Apr;7(2):93–108. {{DOI|10.1177/1524838005285916}} {{PMID|16534146}} p 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current military brats==
The U.S. Defense Department reports that there are currently 2 million American children and teenagers who have had at least one parent deployed in a war zone in the current [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] conflicts.&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;Wilson, Elaine, "Military Teens Cope With Wartime Challenges", American Forces Press Service, Department of Defense, FORT CAMPBELL, Ky., April 22, 2010 http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2010/0410_military child/military-teens.html&lt;/ref&gt; Over 900,000 have had a parent deployed multiple times.&lt;ref name="wilson" /&gt;

Most of the research into military brats has been conducted on the long-term effects on adults who grew up during the Cold War and also during the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and [[Korean War|Korean]] wars. As the Cold War came to an end, the role of the United States Armed Forces changed. The U.S. military realized that there was distinct correlation between the quality of life and retention and operational effectiveness. To this end, the military started to change the living standards that most Cold War brats grew up with. The demographics of the military changed. The modern military has a larger proportion of married military members. Since base housing is designed for fewer families, more families are forced to live off-base.

Military personnel are now being supplemented by more civilians filling essential roles, and the introduction of large megabases that intermesh different service branches and their individual cultures has also affected the demographics.&lt;ref name="McClure473"&gt;McClure, Peggy and Walter Broughton (2000) "Measuring the Cohesion of Military Communities." ''Armed Forces &amp; Society,'' Vol 26 No 3, Spring 2000. p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, during the post-Cold War period, the United States has been involved in three extended military engagements (two in Iraq and one in Afghanistan). The long-term effects of these changes are unknown, but research has been conducted on short-term effects on post-Cold War-era brats.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Today's military brat faces some additional challenges. For example, it is estimated that approximately 50,000 military families have both parents serving in the armed forces; this creates the possibility that both parents may be deployed at the same time.&lt;ref name="Lamberg1541"&gt;Lamberg, Lynne (2004) "When Military Parents are sent to War, Children Left Behind Need Ample Support". ''JAMA'', 2004 Oct 6;292(13):1541–2 {{DOI|10.1001/jama.292.13.1541}} {{PMID|15467043}} p 1541&lt;/ref&gt; Another significant difference is the speed of communication. With the advent of the [[Internet]] it is possible for family members to communicate with servicemen in combat zones. This allows brats to remain in closer contact with their military parent(s), but it also increases tension as more details reach the military families. Round-the-clock news agencies, such as [[CNN]] and [[Fox News]], spread news faster than the military bureaucracy can process the details. This means that military families know that servicemen have died before official word reaches the family. Military psychiatrist Colonel Stephen Cozza says that a "sense of fear" accompanies news of the death of a service member until confirmation that the service member was not a loved one.&lt;ref name="Cozza 377"&gt;Cozza SJ, Chun RS, Polo JA. (2005) "Military Families and Children During Operation Iraqi Freedom." ''Psychiatric Quarterly'', ol 76. No 4. Winter 2005. p 371–378. {{DOI|10.1007/s11126-005-4973-y}} {{PMID|16217632}} p 377&lt;/ref&gt;

Wertsch has pointed out, however, that during the Vietnam War, televised news war coverage was also very intense and constant, and that similar issues of military family fear being intensified by television coverage were also present for military brats and spouses of that era with a family member in the war.&lt;ref name=Wertsch/&gt;

Despite these facts, studies show only a slight increase in immediate stressors among military brats whose parents serve in a combat zone, although no studies on the longer-term effects have ever been done. Boys and younger children do show the most risk when a parent is deployed, but rarely does this require clinical intervention. However, studies show that when a military member is deployed to a combat zone, the family cohesion is more disrupted than when service members are deployed to non-combat zones.&lt;ref&gt;Cozza SJ, Chun RS, Polo JA. (2005) "Military Families and Children During Operation Iraqi Freedom." ''Psychiatric Quarterly'', ol 76. No 4. Winter 2005. p 371–378. {{DOI|10.1007/s11126-005-4973-y}} {{PMID|16217632}} p 373. Cline (1995) p 223 "Generally, people in the Air Force have the least time away; those in the Navy the most. Navy personnel who go to sea have longer separations, but Army and Marine Corps have the most one-year unaccompanied tours. Air Force TDY's are short, but they are irregular, repeated, and frequently unscheduled."&lt;/ref&gt;

Military members can be deployed for days, months, or even years without their family. When a parent is stationed without their family, the children experience the same emotions as children of divorced parents.&lt;ref name = "deploy"&gt;Deployment Center (Undated).

Retrieved on December 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the effects of the divorce, military brats have additional concerns. When a military member is sent away, the family does not always know where they are going or when (or if) the service member will return.&lt;ref name="walls"&gt;Walls, Judith (Sept 2003) [http://www.ces.purdue.edu/terrorism/ "When War is News".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030170829/http://www.ces.purdue.edu/terrorism/ |date=2006-10-30 }} in Terrorism and Children Purdue Extension. Retrieved on December 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that there are three phases to deployment, and each phase has different impacts on the family. Military spouses reported the following when their spouse was deployed:

* Predeployment — Marital stress/conflict, distancing from spouse, anger, resentment, sadness/depression, negative child behavior.
* Deployment — Marital problems, isolation, loneliness, anger, resentment, sadness/depression, reduced communications, stress, less social support, assuming the role of single parent, child care difficulties, sleep disturbances, physical symptoms, home and car repairs, difficulty accessing military services, negative child behavior.
* Postdeployment/Reunion — Redefining responsibilities, marital stress, communication problems, anxiety, anger, resentment, parent-child attachment issues&lt;ref&gt;Kelley (2002) p 5&lt;/ref&gt;

While separation produces stress, according to the US military it strengthens the children by forcing them to take on additional responsibilities when a parent is absent, encouraging independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,Deployment_Family_Children,00.html Your Child and Separation] on Military.

A Pentagon study released in June 2009 reported that children of combat troops show more fear, anxiety and behavioral problems.&lt;ref name = "2009study"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/military/2009-06-24-military-kids_N.htm| title=Troops' kids feel war toll| publisher=USA Today| date=2009-06-24| last=Zoroya| first=Gregg| accessdate=2009-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the study, spouses report that when the service member is sent to a combat zone, that their children start to experienced increased anxiety.

==="Suddenly military" brats ("Reserve brats" or "National Guard brats")===

"Suddenly military" ([[reservist]] and [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]) families face additional challenges, related to isolation from other military-family peers, and isolation within their home-town communities, not faced by traditional military families.&lt;ref name=Roehr&gt;Roehr, Bob. [http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/732589 "Families of Deployed Reserve, National Guard Soldiers Face Challenges"], Medscape Today, ''Medscape Medical News'', November 16, 2010 (Denver, Colorado)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increased demands on the U.S. military, reservists have been called to active duty. The children of these reservists, who are suddenly called to extended active duty, are technically military brats, but they may not identify with or share all of the characteristics of traditional brats (although in certain specific areas, such as war-related issues, they may share a great deal&lt;ref name=Roehr/&gt;). In an effort to help integrate "suddenly military" brats, groups like "Operation: Military Kids" and "Our Military Kids" came into existence. Operation: Military Kids is a program designed to help "suddenly military" children understand the military culture to which they now belong, and Our Military Kids provides monetary grants that support tutoring, sports and other extracurricular activities of National Guard and Reserve children, whose parents sometimes incur a lapse in income upon being called to active duty.

National Guard families are not as familiar with military culture. They are physically separated from other military families, meaning they may get less emotional support during wartime, and may not be as emotionally prepared for active-duty deployment.&lt;ref name=Roehr/&gt;&lt;ref name="Unknown2"&gt;[http://www.k12.wa.us/OperationMilitaryKids/TrainingManual/Chapter_2_Final.pdf Operation Military Kids: Chapter Two Impact of the Global War on Terrorism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060309142207/http://www.k12.wa.us/OperationMilitaryKids/TrainingManual/Chapter_2_Final.pdf |date=2006-03-09 }}.p 5–9 Retrieved on January 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the formal and informal support structures available for the regular military families are not as readily available to reservist families.&lt;ref name="Lamberg1541" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Roehr/&gt; Operation: Military Kids teaches "suddenly military" brats about military culture and expectations.&lt;ref name="OMK4" /&gt;

[[File:Maj Troy Gilbert's Military Funeral.jpg|thumb|right|Family members of a deceased US Airman walk to a grave site.]]

Children of reservist soldiers also don't share the highly mobile aspect of "regular service" military brat life. They may, however, still develop feelings of difference or isolation in relation to non-military children or teenagers in their home towns, due to war-deployment related stresses and war-aftermath issues that their non-military peers may not be able to fully understand.&lt;ref name=Roehr/&gt; Consequently, it may be harder for teachers and health care professionals to identify and address war-deployment-related child, adolescent or family problems, unless they are specifically screened for.&lt;ref name=Roehr/&gt; Although the family may not be as fully immersed in military culture, individual reservist parents may still effect varying degrees of militarization of the family social environment and the child's upbringing. Some children born to no-longer active duty veterans may also experience a number of these issues.

===Death of a parent in combat===
The effect of having a parent killed during military operations has not been specifically studied.&lt;ref name="Cozza 377" /&gt; Limited studies on children who have lost a parent show that 10–15% experience depression and a few develop childhood [[traumatic grief]] (the inability to recall any positive memories of the deceased parent).&lt;ref&gt;Lamberg, Lynne (2004) "When Military Parents are sent to War, Children Left Behind Need Ample Support". JAMA, 2004 Oct 6;292(13):1541–2 {{DOI|10.1001/jama.292.13.1541}} {{PMID|15467043}} p 1541.

===Peacetime military deaths===

Training and preparing for war also involves significant dangers, as do other military duties. Consequently, many military brats live with the reality of risk to one or both parents even when there is no active war. Peacetime military accidents claim lives every year at a significantly higher rate than accidents for the civilian population; some service professions such as military pilots, paratroopers and other airborne soldiers, aircraft carrier flight deck workers, Coast Guard sea rescue, ordnance or munitions workers, Naval firefighters, as well as those training or drilling in live ammunition exercises, all experience higher annual death rates. Such casualties are difficult, if not impossible, to keep hidden from children or teenagers in small base communities.

==Military Child Month==

The U.S. Department of Defense has designated April as "Month of the Military Child" with special programs, public educational and support activities coordinated during this time each year. The Department of Defense also uses the term "Military Brat" in some of its research and literature about military children.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;Williams, Rudi.

==Community for former military brats==
As adults, military brats sometimes try to reunite with their brat heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Ender (2002) p xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study, "Military Brats: Issues and Associations in Adulthood," identified several reasons why some military brats, as adults, seek out brat organizations. Military brats can feel a "sense of euphoria" when they discover that other brats share the same feelings and emotions. According to the study, brats share a bond with one another through common experiences that transcends race, religion, and nationality.&lt;ref name="The Military Brats Seal"/&gt; Another common theme behind their joining brat organizations is to stay connected or reconnect with their old friends.
With all the focus on veterans, the children are left to grow up in sometimes harsh, usually very strict environments with no recognition and no help. With enormous differences between military children and civilian children, one might think that there would be inquiry into the effects, yet few can be found readily available. Mary Edwards Werstch writes about her experiences, as well as the experiences of those she has interviewed, in her book ''Brats: Growing up inside the Fortress''. Pat Conroy also sheds light on the difficult circumstances of growing up in his book (later a movie), ''[[The Great Santini]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2002) p 73–77&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of term==

===Origin of "military brat"===
The origin of the term "military brat" is unknown. There is some evidence that it dates back hundreds of years into the British Empire, and originally stood for "British Regiment Attached Traveler".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Clifton| first=Grace| title=Making the Case for the BRAT (British Regiment Attached Traveler)| journal=British Educational Research Journal| year=2004| volume=30|issue=3|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1080/01411920410001689733/pdf|via=[[Wiley Online Library]]| doi=10.1080/01411920410001689733| pages=457–462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/66/1/65/|title=Military children and families: Strengths and challenges during peace and war|last=Park|first=Nansook|journal=[[American Psychologist]]|volume=66|issue=1|date=Jan 2011|pages=65–72|doi=10.1037/a0021249|quote=The origin of the term military brat is not agreed on, although some have traced it to an acronym for British Regiment Attached Traveler}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, acronyms are a product of the 20th century and all attempts to trace this theory have failed to find a legitimate source.  There have been American military brats dating back 200 years to the birth of the United States.&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt; Military spouses and their children have been following armies for thousands of years, perhaps for as long as there has been organized warfare. &lt;!-- An older (and more general/non-U.S. specific) term for these mobile military-dependent populations is "[[camp follower]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holmes |first=Richard |coauthor=ed |title=The Oxford Companion to Military History |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-866209-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; The term "Little Traveller", used to describe the travelling child of a soldier (following his or her father's army from place to place), also appears in literature as early as 1811.

In Johnson's Dictionary of 1755, "brat" is defined as either "a child, so called in contempt" or "the progeny; the offspring". Examples are quoted from Spenser's ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', published in 1590; ''[[Coriolanus]]'' and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' by Shakespeare (1564-1616); and two unidentified works by Swift (1667–1745).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/?page_id=7070&amp;i=280| title=Johnson's Dictionary| website=A Dictionary of the English Language| accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.word-detective.com/060704.html| title=Issue of June 7, 2004 - see "Take two earplugs and a good book"| website=The Word Detective| accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern perception===
Noted military brat researcher Mary Edwards Wertsch polled 85 ex-military children as to whether or not they liked the term "military brat", and only five respondents (5.9% of the study group) objected to the term.&lt;ref name=Wertsch/&gt;

The term is now widely used by researchers and academicians and so is no longer merely a [[military slang|slang]] term, but a name clearly attached to a recognized and well-studied segment of U.S. culture: "Most of the professional research on growing up in military families has contributed to the perpetuation of the 'brat' label," sociologist and noted expert on the study of military brats Morten Ender wrote. "It is no wonder that the label endures and is as popular as ever."&lt;ref&gt;Ender (1996) p 128&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reappropriation|Linguistic reclamation]] is the appropriation of a [[pejorative]] [[epithet]] by its target, to turn an insult into a positive term and deny others the ability to define it;&lt;ref&gt;Godrej, Farah. [http://mpsa.indiana.edu/conf2003papers/1032831537.pdf "Spaces for Counter-Narratives: The Phenomenology of Reclamation (PDF)."] Georgetown University, Department of Government.

Sociologist Karen Williams used it reluctantly in her research, with the disclaimer, "to follow the wishes of the participants. It is a term that they use and feel comfortable with."&lt;ref name = "Williams 2002 p67"&gt;Williams (2002) p 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that professional military culture has also reclaimed ownership of the term. Admiral [[Dennis C. Blair]], former [[Commander in Chief]], [[U.S. Pacific Command]], and former U.S. [[Director of National Intelligence]], said, "There's a standard term for the military child: 'Brat.' While it sounds pejorative, it's actually a term of great affection."&lt;ref name="Blair"&gt;Blair, Admiral Dennis, Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Command.

The R stands for Resilient, Reliable, and Responsible. Brats bounce back from the turmoil inflicted upon them by their parents' [[profession]]. The A stands for Amiable, Adaptable, and Audacious.

Brats hang in there when the going gets tough, and they also stand up for the beliefs of others. They have the opportunity to be [[minority group|minorities]] themselves, sometimes by their race, but almost always as the new kids."&lt;/ref&gt; This trend is also visible among notable and influential civilians: Senator [[Ben Nelson]], a member of the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services]], wrote, "when the word 'brat' is used to describe someone it is not meant as a compliment, but when it is preceded by another word and becomes "military brat" it becomes a term of endearment."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Ben (2005) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070106165723/http://www.senate.gov/~bennelson/news/details.cfm?id=239293&amp;&amp; "April is a Very Special Month for Children in Military Families"] Retrieved on January 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Congresswoman [[Carol Shea-Porter]] said, "I married what is affectionately known as an Army brat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carolforcongress.com/index.php?blog=6&amp;title=why_i_m_running_for_congress&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213200640/http://www.carolforcongress.com/index.php?blog=6&amp;title=why_i_m_running_for_congress&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1|archivedate=2006-12-13|title=Carol Shea-Porter "Why I'm Running for Congress"|accessdate=January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[John Cornyn]] identifies himself as a military brat, and also identified Judge [[Janice Brown]] as one, during her confirmation hearing before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://judiciary.senate.gov/member_statement.cfm?id=966&amp;wit_id=2047| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061227210044/http://judiciary.senate.gov/member_statement.cfm?id=966&amp;wit_id=2047| archivedate=2006-12-27| title=John Cornyn's statement before the Judiciary Committee| accessdate=January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military culture has created numerous positive [[backronym]]s for "brat", such as "Born, Raised And Transferred" or "Brave, Resilient, Adaptable, and Trustworthy."

In late 2014, two civilian children's book authors advocated the use of the acronym "CHAMPs" – "Child Heroes Attached to Military Personnel" – as a replacement for "brat".

==History of research efforts==

===Coining of the term "third culture kid" and early research===
In the 1970s, sociologist [[Ruth Hill Useem]] coined the term "[[third culture kid]]s" (TCKs) for a child who follows his parents "into another culture."&lt;ref&gt;Reken, Ruth and Paulette Bethel, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070304033213/http://www.crossculturalkid.org/cck.htm Third Culture Kids: Prototypes for Understanding Other Cross-Cultural Kids] Retrieved December 3, 2006. Sociologist David Pollock describes a TCK as "a person who has spent a significant part of his or her developmental years outside the parents' culture. The TCK builds relationships to all of the cultures, while not having full ownership of any. Although elements from each culture are assimilated into the TCK's life experience, the sense of belonging is in relationship to others of a similar background." Also in Reken.&lt;/ref&gt; Useem used the term "Third Culture Kids" because TCKs integrate aspects of their birth culture (the first culture) and the new culture (the second culture), creating a unique "third culture". Globally, offspring of military households comprise about 30% of all TCKs,&lt;ref&gt;Cottrell (2002), p. 230. Prior to the end of WWII and the rise of two global superpowers, [[missionary|missionaries]] were the largest group of TCKs. After WWII, and the rise of two global super powers, the children of military and government personnel became the largest components of TCKs: Military (30%), Government (23%), Missionary (17%), Business (16%), and "Other" (14%).&lt;/ref&gt; but they are almost exclusively from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Cottrell (2002) p 230–231.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Start of Department of Defense research===
Systematic research on individuals in such environments has been conducted since the 1980s. Responding to social and psychological issues recorded in military families and communities, the U.S. Armed Forces sponsored research on the long-term impact of growing up as a military dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Ender (2002) p xxv&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the U.S. there is no significant literature on the effects of growing up as a military dependent.&lt;ref name = "US Only"&gt;Clifton, Grace (2004) "Making the case for the BRAT (British Regiment Attached Traveller)" in ''British Education Research Journal'', Vol 1 No 3 June 2004. p 458. Similarly reported in Ender (2002) p xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Department of Defense does not track or monitor former brats, any study on adult brats is based upon self-identification. Thus, even though the studies are performed using [[scientific method|scientific sampling methods]], they may contain [[sampling bias|bias]] because of the difficulty in conducting [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] [[epidemiology#Types of studies|studies]] across broad-based [[sampling (statistics)|population samples]]. Some researchers used referrals, the Internet, and newspaper articles to identify military brats.&lt;ref&gt;Ender (2002) p XXIII-XXV and 87–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mary Edwards Wertsch: Identification of military brat cultural identity===

In 1991, Mary Edwards Wertsch "launched the movement for military brat cultural identity" with her book ''Military Brats: Legacies of Childhood inside the Fortress''.&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://www.militarybrat.com/Podcasts/EBHAS2.mp3 Podcast interview with Rudy Maxa] Retrieved on January 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In researching her book, Wertsch identified common themes from interviews of over 80 offspring of military households. While this book does not purport to be a scientific study, subsequent research has validated many of her findings. In the introduction to the book, former military brat [[Pat Conroy]], the author of ''[[The Prince of Tides]]'' and ''[[The Great Santini]],'' wrote,

{{quote|Her book speaks in a language that is clear and stinging and instantly recognizable to me [as a brat], yet it's a language I was not even aware I spoke. She isolates the military brats of America as a new indigenous subculture with our own customs, rites of passage, forms of communication, and folkways&amp;nbsp;.... With this book, Mary [Wertsch] astonished me and introduced me to a secret family I did not know I had.&lt;ref&gt;From the introduction to the book, but quoted from [https://web.archive.org/web/20061230230736/http://www.tckworld.com/read/mbrats.html TCK World's Suggested Reading.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Brats: Our Journey Home''===
In 2005 military brat and filmmaker [[Donna Musil]] released the first documentary ever made exclusively about military brats, ''Brats: Our Journey Home''.&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt; To date, the documentary has won six film awards.&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt; Musil furthers the premise that military brats form a distinct American subculture with a commonly held sense of identity that is actually a distinct American ethnicity.&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt; The documentary also draws on many studies interviews of researchers, counselors and psychologists, along with interviews of numerous former military brats.&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt;

===Perceived invisibility of culture and experiences===
Musil's documentary also highlights the feeling among many military brats that the culture and lives of military brats are largely invisible to most Americans.&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt; Some sparse and superficial aspects of military brat life may be known, but a fuller sense of awareness of one of America's largest (and oldest) subcultures is largely non-existent.&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt; The documentary starts with country music singer and former military brat [[Kris Kristofferson]] calling military brats "an invisible tribe" comprising 5% of the American population.&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt;

The documentary closes with another quote from former military brat and author Pat Conroy, who writes,

{{quote|We spent our entire childhoods in the service of our country, and no one even knew we were there.&lt;ref name="bojh" /&gt;}}

'''Mormon folklore''' is a body of expressive [[culture]] unique to members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and other sects of Mormonism. Mormon folklore includes [[Folklore|tales]], [[oral history]], popular beliefs, [[Tradition|customs]], [[music]], [[joke]]s, and material culture [[tradition]]s. In folklore studies, Mormons can be seen as a regional group, since the core group of Mormon settlers in Utah had a common religion and had to modify their surroundings for survival.&lt;ref name="Mormondom as Regional"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Eliason|editor1-first=Eric A.|editor2-last=Mould|editor2-first=Tom|title=Latter-day lore: Mormon folklore studies |date=2013 |isbn=978-1-60781-285-2 |url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/upcat/id/1884/rec/1 |chapter=Mormondom as Regional Culture: An introduction to Society, Symbols, and Landscape |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|115}} This historical regional area includes Utah, Southeastern Idaho, parts of Wyoming and eastern Nevada, and a few towns in eastern Arizona, southern Alberta, northwestern New Mexico, southern Colorado, and northern Chihuahua, Mexico.&lt;ref name=folklife /&gt;{{rp|826}}

Verbal lore for Mormons includes stories that missionaries tell each other as a part of initiation and also to encourage adherence to mission rules. Members tell stories about [[Mormon pioneers]], [[The Three Nephites]], and unseen benevolent spirits to bolster their faith. In pioneer times, folk songs alternately praised and punished prominent leaders like [[Brigham Young]].

Common customs for Mormons include reciting conversion narratives, which is especially common during [[Worship services of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Fast and testimony meeting|fast and testimony meeting]]. Married members also commonly tell how they were inspired to choose their spouse, and some women with children recount that a vision of a future child inspired them to have more children. In the Mormon regional area, creative date invitations are a common way for teenagers to ask each other out. [[Pioneer Day (Utah)|Pioneer Day]] is a state holiday in Utah, where members patriotically celebrate their religious predecessors.

Pioneer handicrafts were inspired by the many cultures that came together in Utah. Handicrafts were initially a necessity, and pioneers developed techniques to adapt their skills to the materials on hand. Later, the [[Relief Society]] promoted handicrafts as improving mental health. Along with quilting and needlework, pioneers also made [[Hair jewellery]], human hair wreaths, and silk thread. Towns in the Mormon regional area have a unique combination of features, including unpainted barns, irrigation ditches, wooden moveable hay derricks, and Lombardy poplars as wind breaks. Tombstones in this area commonly depict clasped hands or a Mormon temple.  Mormon fundamentalists have different folklore from Latter-day Saints. They draw on their shared heritage of experience in government raids to unify them, and enjoy folk dancing.

== Research into Mormon folklore ==
[[Austin E. and Alta S. Fife|Alta S. and Austin E. Fife]] are the founders of research into Mormon folklore, a discipline that has expanded greatly since the couple’s initial work in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.uen.org/utah_history_encyclopedia/f/FIFE_AUSTIN_AND_ALTA.html |contribution= Fife, Austin and Alta |first= William A. |last= Wilson |year= 1994 |editor-first= Allan Kent |editor-last= Powell |title= Utah History Encyclopedia |location= Salt Lake City |publisher= [[University of Utah Press]] |isbn= 0-87480-425-6 |oclc= 30473917 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130609174656/http://www.uen.org/utah_history_encyclopedia/f/FIFE_AUSTIN_AND_ALTA.html |archivedate= 9 June 2013 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although previous and contemporary scholars had briefly addressed the issue, the Fifes expanded the field, both through their collection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.usu.edu/folklo/folkarchive/FMCSeries2.html |title=FOLK COLLECTION 4: No. 1: Series II: Vols. 10-18: The Fife Mormon Collection: Manuscript Sources |publisher=Library.usu.edu |date= |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; now known as the Fife Folklore Archive, held at the [[Merrill-Cazier Library]] on the [[Utah State University]] campus in [[Logan, Utah]]. Their book on Mormon folklore, ''Saints of Sage and Saddle'', was published in 1956. This book, according to folklorist Jill Terry Rudy, "remains the most complete book-length treatment of Mormon folklore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudy|first1=Jill Terry|title=Mormon Folklore Studies|journal=Irreantum|date=2005|volume=7|issue=1|url=http://documentslide.com/documents/irreantum-volume-7-no-1-2005.html|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folklorist [[William A. Wilson (folklorist)|William A. Wilson]] also specialized in Mormon folklore, and helped establish the way Mormon folklore is organized in archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Folklore (William A.

== Verbal lore ==
{{See also|List of Mormon folk beliefs}}

=== Missionary lore ===
[[Missionary (LDS Church)|Missionaries]] have their own set of folklore. According to folklorist [[William A. Wilson (folklorist)|William A. Wilson]], missionaries tell stories for four main purposes: to build a sense of comradeship, to cope with the pressures of missionary life, to encourage missionaries to keep mission rules, and to assure themselves of future victory.&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt;{{rp|10–18}}

They commonly tell stories about how new missionaries, or "greenies", are initiated into the existing missionary group through pranks, even if these pranks never occurred. Learning missionary slang also helps new missionaries feel like part of the missionary community. Missionaries often tell stories in which some missionaries try to escape mission life but are discovered. One common "unauthorized trip story"&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt;{{rp|13}} tells how two missionaries write their weekly reports in advance, entrust them to their landlady, and embark on a sightseeing tour, only to be caught when their landlady sends the reports all at once. Another common story tells of a missionary who decides to break mission rules and participate in a sports tournament, only to be discovered by their mission president when their picture appears in the news. These stories focus on trickster heroes who fail and embody the group's childish fantasies, acting as "an approved steam-valve for the group".&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt;{{rp|14}} In some stories that encourage obedience, a missionary disobeys the rules and suffers disastrous consequences. Other stories tell of missionaries miraculously saved from danger. Missionaries also tell stories about getting the best of a hostile world, even if it causes other people to suffer. Missionaries in such stories [[Shaking the dust from the feet|shake the dust from their feet]] after leaving a city that was unresponsive to their message. After performing this ritual, the city is destroyed through a natural disaster, war, or economic depression. Stories where people insult missionaries, only to come to an untimely end, are common.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=William A.|title=On Being Human: The Folklore of Mormon Missionaries|date=1981|publisher=Utah State University Press|location=Logan, Utah|isbn=0-87421-114-X|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/honor_lectures/60/|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Folk narratives ===
Mormons tell stories about early church members, [[The Three Nephites]], and spirits of dead people. Mormons often retell stories about how early members of the church endured persecution and hardships in order to inspire other members. Stories about [[Polygamy in the Latter Day Saint movement|plural wives]] often tell of the women's plight in having to share a husband, or the opposite, the convenient companionship of her sister wives.&lt;ref name="American Folklore"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=William A.|editor1-last=Brunvand|editor1-first=Jan Harold|title=American folklore: an encyclopedia|date=1996|publisher=Garland Publ.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8153-0751-8|chapter=Mormon Folklore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2XGPAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%27%27American+folklore:+an+encyclopedia%27%27&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB6Mnn6LrbAhUM-J8KHUsUCOgQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;!--search "Mormon folklore" in Google book to find the article--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Golden Kimball]] was a member of [[Seventy (LDS Church)|the Seventy]] and a folk hero known for swearing and undermining authority; stories told about him are often humorous.&lt;ref name="American Folklore" /&gt; Stories about Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, Eliza Snow, and other founders have a near-mythic status.&lt;ref name=folklife /&gt;

[[The Three Nephites]] are three [[Nephite]] disciples chosen by [[Jesus]] in the [[Book of Mormon]] to never die. In modern Three Nephites stories, one or more of these men appear to give assistance to those in need and then mysteriously disappear.&lt;ref name="American Folklore" /&gt; The assistance ranges from providing childcare to fixing a car. According to William Wilson, Three Nephites stories "reflect and reinforce church programs and, by endowing them with mystical values, place them beyond criticism or questioning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=William A. Wilson|editor1-last=Eliason|editor1-first=Eric A.|editor2-last=Mould|editor2-first=Tom|title=Latter-day lore: Mormon folklore studies |url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/upcat/id/1884/rec/1 |date=2013|isbn=978-1-60781-285-2|accessdate=22 June 2017|chapter=Freeways, Parking Lots, and Ice Cream Stands: The Three Nephites in Contemporary Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|209}}

Many Mormons engage in [[genealogy]] research in order to perform [[Baptism for the dead|baptisms for the dead]]. One common folk narrative is for a researcher to have lost hope of finding more information, only to miraculously find it in a book or cemetery. There are also many stories of spirits helping church members to perform their temple work for the dead or conveying their gratitude somehow.&lt;ref name="American Folklore" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A close call / Kristie Niederer |url=https://findingaid.lib.byu.edu/viewItem/FA%202/Series%201/Subseries%203/Subseries%202/1.1.3.2.2.51/ |website=findingaid.lib.byu.edu |publisher=L.

=== Folk songs ===
{{see also|Mormon folk music}}
In the 1850s and 1860s, Mormons used secular songs for worship and entertainment. They wrote their own poetry and set it to the familiar, secular tunes. One popular tune was "The Sea." Early church leader [[W. W. Phelps (Mormon)|W. W. Phelps]] composed lyrics to the tune, as did fellow pioneer Joseph Cain. Some songs satirized other religions, as in "The God that others worship" set to the tune "The rose that all are praising." Mormons also penned songs about persecution and [[Death of Joseph Smith|Joseph and Hyrum's death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hicks|first1=Michael|title=Mormonism and music: a history|date=2003|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana|isbn=0-252-07147-6|edition=1st paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many songs about Brigham Young circulated, depicting Young as either a tyrannical leader with a troubled home life or a righteous leader whose guidance led the Mormons into prosperity. In the case of "Brigham, Brigham Young," the song was accepted when performed by a Mormon for other Mormons, but incited a riot when performed for mixed company. L.M. Hilton's version of "Hard Times" emphasized optimism in the face of persecution; Hilton said that it was one of Brigham Young's favorite songs and that he would sing it to Mormons to cheer them up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudy|first=Jill Terry|editor1-last=Eliason|editor1-first=Eric A.|editor2-last=Mould|editor2-first=Tom|title=Latter-day lore: Mormon folklore studies |url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/upcat/id/1884/rec/1 |date=2013|isbn=978-1-60781-285-2|accessdate=22 June 2017|chapter=Portraits in Song: Gleanings from the Brigham Young Folk Song Cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Descriptions of customs ==
=== Testimonies ===
Relating conversion narratives is one of the many ways Mormons express their faith. During monthly [[Worship services of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Fast and testimony meeting|fast and testimony meeting]] held on [[Fast Sunday]], some members voluntarily share their dedication to their faith in a ritualized way, including informal ritualized expressions. Some of these informal ritualized expressions are so frequent that members joke about playing "testimony bingo" when they hear commonly used phrases like "I know beyond a shadow of a doubt" or "I know the church is true."&lt;ref name="Making Mormons"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Eliason|editor1-first=Eric A.|editor2-last=Mould|editor2-first=Tom |url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/upcat/id/1884/rec/1 |title=Latter-day lore: Mormon folklore studies|date=2013|isbn=978-1-60781-285-2|chapter=Making Mormons: An Introduction to Formative Customs and Traditions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion narratives are commonly related by LDS members in a way that mirrors the conversion of Joseph Smith: as a search for knowledge leading to receiving the "gift of true religious knowledge" and conversion to the gospel. Folklore student Amy Ward studied the conversion narratives of lifelong members and adult converts to the LDS church. She found that adult converts were more likely to describe their conversion was part of a long, unconscious search for religious truth. Folklore scholar Eric Eliason notes that Mormons tend to prefer sincere, even humorous, conversion narratives over melodramatic or self-serving ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eliason|first1=Eric A.|title=Toward the Folkloristic Study of Latter-day Saint Conversion Narratives|journal=BYU Studies Quarterly|date=1999|volume=38|issue=1|url=http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/byusq/vol38/iss1/12/|accessdate=11 May 2017}} "It should be noted, too, that Latter-day Saints often evaluate conversion narratives and testimonies based on an antiperformance aesthetic. Stories that seem contrived, melodramatic, self-centered, or manipulative can be deemed in violation of the principles of this genre's ''raisons d'être''."&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage confirmation narratives, told in communal cooperation settings, relate how people let God or a church leader decide whom they should marry. This helped them to overcome their anxiety about whom to choose to marry. The folk belief that there exists only one suitable marriage partner, perpetuated in Mormon media but not supported by Mormon theology, exacerbates this anxiety. Generally, marriage confirmation narratives support the idea that righteous living within Mormon expectations will lead to blessings like receiving spiritual revelation about who should become one's marriage partner and having a happy marriage. Such narratives help reinforce Mormon ideas about Mormons being a chosen community who receive special spiritual experiences, and help establish and fortify socially desirable behavior.&lt;ref name="Made in Heaven"&gt;{{cite book
|url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/upcat/id/1884/rec/1 |last=Schoemaker|first=George H.|editor1-last=Eliason|editor1-first=Eric A.|editor2-last=Mould|editor2-first=Tom|title=Latter-day lore: Mormon folklore studies|date=2013|isbn=978-1-60781-285-2|chapter=Made in Heaven: Marriage Confirmation Narratives Among Mormons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Mormon women experience a vision of a future child that inspired them to have more children. If the next child is different from the child in the vision, the woman knows that the child is still "coming" and has another child. Margaret K. Brady documented this narrative type and sees it as a way to relieve Mormon women from the guilt they feel about thinking not to have more children, because the vision encourages them to change their mind and have more children. Sometimes these women share this experience in a visionary narrative. Telling the story reinforces the woman's spiritual identity, thus giving her a measure of power in her religious community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brady|first1=Margaret K.|title=Transformations of Power: Mormon Women's Visionary Narratives|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|date=October 1987|volume=100|issue=398|pages=461|doi=10.2307/540905|jstor=540905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Courtship and families ===
Creative date invitations are pervasive in the Idaho, Utah, and Arizona area, starting in the 1970s when young women were encouraged to ask young men to [[Sadie Hawkins dance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creative Invitations for Dates and Dances – World History &amp; Culture -L. Tom Perry Special Collections|url=https://sites.lib.byu.edu/worldhistory/folklore-william-a-wilson-folklore-archives/popular-search-topics/creative-invitations-for-dates-and-dances/|website=sites.lib.byu.edu|publisher=Brigham Young University|accessdate=1 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107003720/https://sites.lib.byu.edu/worldhistory/folklore-william-a-wilson-folklore-archives/popular-search-topics/creative-invitations-for-dates-and-dances/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folklorist Kristi Young writes that creative date invitations allowed young women to feel more comfortable asking young men on dates, since creative date invitations often do not require face-to-face interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Kristi|editor1-last=Eliason|editor1-first=Eric A.|editor2-last=Mould|editor2-first=Tom|title=Latter-day lore: Mormon folklore studies|date=2013|isbn=978-1-60781-285-2|accessdate=22 June 2017 |url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/upcat/id/1884/rec/1 |chapter=Now that I've kissed the ground you walk on: A look at gender in creative date invitations}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} Sometimes the recipient of a creative date invitation will accept even if they already have a significant other.&lt;ref name=folklife&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliason|first1=Eric A.|editor1-last=Bronner|editor1-first=Simon J.|title=Encyclopedia of American folklife|date=2006|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|location=Armonk (N.Y.)|isbn=978-0-7656-8052-5|chapter=Mormon Culture Region, Mormon Fundamentalists, Mormons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LDS church encourages families to meet together in [[Family Home Evening|"family home evening"]] on Monday nights. Assignments for prayer, song, lesson, game, and treat are often rotated between family members on homemade charts.&lt;ref name=folklife /&gt; Certain rituals are performed during life events. After a baby is born, it is given a blessing, usually by their father with other male relatives and friends joining the blessing circle. Children are usually [[Baptism in Mormonism|baptized]] at age eight, and receive a [[patriarchal blessing]] sometime in their teens. Young men and women may volunteer to be a [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary]]. In LDS funerals, the deceased wears their ceremonial [[Temple robes|temple clothing]] to be buried.&lt;ref name=folklife /&gt;

=== Pioneer Day ===
The first [[Pioneer Day (Utah)|Pioneer Day]] was celebrated in 1849, with Mormons in Salt Lake City marching in [[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]], or congregational groups, around [[Temple Square]] in a show of patriotism. Many other towns in Utah had their own celebrations. Steven Olson notes that Pioneer Day celebrations reenact an idealized culture, providing a window into Mormon culture. Celebrations in the latter half of the 19th century emphasized how Mormons were a free, blessed, and chosen people. Floats and decorations celebrated agricultural bounties that Mormons saw as God blessing their settlement. Mormon leaders were escorted from their homes to the celebrations, where they participated as speakers. Parades separated participants by age and gender and celebrated traditional gender roles. Dances and sports competitions were common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olson|first1=Steven L.|title=Celebrating Cultural Identity: Pioneer Day in Nineteenth-Century Mormonism|journal=BYU Studies|date=1996|volume=36|issue=1|url=http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/byusq/vol36/iss1/9/|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Utah where Pioneer Day is an official holiday, the day is celebrated with fireworks and historical reenactments. However, outside of Utah, observance depends on local members; often a congregation will have pioneer-themed talks but no festivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bruner|first1=Rachel|title=What is Pioneer Day to Mormons?|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/pioneer-day-and-mormons-2159402|accessdate=15 May 2017|work=ThoughtCo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch Mormons tend not to celebrate it, but in Germany, Pioneer Day is popular among Mormons.&lt;ref name=folklife /&gt;

In the mid-20th century, several performance art traditions helped revive folk arts. Church-wide folk-dancing festivals taught folk dancing to Mormon youth in the 1970s. Roadshows allowed members to exercise their creative talents on a smaller scale.&lt;ref name="Bradley" /&gt;

In some missions, it is common to burn clothing to mark special missionary anniversaries, such as a tie after six months of service and a shirt after one year.&lt;ref name=folklife /&gt;

== Material objects ==
=== Handicrafts ===
Pine furniture, pottery, wool textiles, quilts, woodwork, decorative needlework, and toys have unique Mormon elements.&lt;ref name="Mormondom as Regional" /&gt;{{rp|33}} In early Mormon history, pioneers gathered in Utah from Europe and other parts of the world, bringing their knowledge of handicrafts with them. Utah pioneers were isolated and had to make most of their own clothes and linens. They adapted the techniques they knew to the materials they had on hand. Local historian Shirley B. Paxman argues that the pioneers's limited materials combined with their isolation resulted in work that was not self-conscious.&lt;ref name="Paxman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paxman|first1=Shirley B.|title=Homespun|date=1976|publisher=Deseret Book|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|isbn=0-87747-584-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since pioneer women did not think of themselves as artists, their decorative work was for their own or their family's simple pleasure. Pioneer women in Utah made their own yarn, linen thread and silk thread.&lt;ref name="Paxman" /&gt; In the 1870s, pioneer women sold their handicrafts in cooperative stores owned by the Relief Society.&lt;ref name=Richards /&gt;{{rp|80}} When handicrafts were no longer a necessity, they were promoted as improving mental health. ''Handicrafts for Women'', published by the Relief Society in 1935, encouraged women to learn handicrafts to relieve them of the monotony of housework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beeley|first1=Glenn Johnson|title=Handicrafts for Everywoman|date=1935|publisher=The National Women's Relief Society|location=Salt Lake City, Utah}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, Relief Societies held monthly homemaking days to learn and practice household arts and crafts including needlework and quilting.&lt;ref name="Bradley" /&gt; In 1963, handicrafts saw a resurgence in popularity that coincided with the Relief Society Magazine's new feature on arts and crafts.&lt;ref name="Staker" /&gt;

[[Relief Society]] crafts are one way that folk art is disseminated between Mormons. In 1963, crafter Ruby Swallow made resin grapes using old Christmas ornaments as molds. She presented the craft at a [[stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]] homemaking activity, and soon after taught her technique in a local craft store. The craft remained unusually popular, and many homes in the Intermountain West had a set by the 1970s. Eleanor Zimmerman, who helped popularize the grapes, said that the craft was popular because it was handmade but "looked store-bought."&lt;ref name="Staker"/&gt;{{rp|79}} Mark L. Staker, a curator for the Museum of Church History and Art, believes that the staying power of resin grapes is partially because they were made as a community, and also because ''Relief Society Magazine'' began emphasizing arts and crafts in 1963.&lt;ref name="Staker"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staker|first1=Mark L.|title=By Their Works Ye Shall Know Them: The World View Expressed in Mormon Folk Art|journal=BYU Studies|date=1995|volume=35|issue=5|url=http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/byusq/vol35/iss3/5/|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One popular genre of crafts turns inexpensive utilitarian objects into decorative ones.&lt;ref name="Thatcher" /&gt;

Utahns created a Utah quilt guild in 1977 to promote and preserve quilt making techniques. In documenting pioneer quilts, the Utah quilt guild found a wide variety of styles, including paper piecing, applique, and crazy quilt styles. Quilts were a common wedding gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Covington|first1=Kae|title=Gathered in time: Utah quilts and their makers, settlement to 1950|date=1997|publisher=University of Utah Press|location=Salt Lake City|isbn=0-87480-541-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneer quilts often featured natural imagery, with sego lilies and beehives being special symbols of Mormon pioneers.&lt;ref name="Bradley"&gt;{{Citation

[[Hair jewellery]] and wreaths were among the popular handicrafts in the 19th century, especially in the 1860s and '70s. Hair flowers made by Mormons, like those in the rest of the United States, traditionally had a woman's hair for the petals and her husband's for the center. Watch chains made from hair were commonly sent to missionaries to remind them of family members. The Salt Lake temple entrance had a hair wreath containing hair from prominent church leaders on display until 1967.&lt;ref name="Staker" /&gt; Hair wreaths containing hair from multiple people were displayed in public areas, symbolizing community unity.&lt;ref name="Staker" /&gt;

=== Furniture ===
Early Utah pioneers in 1847 used wood from hardwood packing boxes as material for furniture.&lt;ref name="Barker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barker|first1=Marilyn Conover|title=The Legacy of Mormon Furniture|date=1995|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=0-87905-632-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}} Steam-driven lathes made Roman turned legs and furniture with spool-turned decoration popular.&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt;{{rp|17}} Leaders encouraged craftsmanship, and cabinetmakers made their own designs, usually influenced by fashionable designs like the [[American Empire style|Empire style]].

In the 1850s and 60s, furniture was in great demand, but by 1869, there were enough cabinetmakers to create a variety of competing styles.&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt;{{rp|37}} William Bell, a cabinetmaker from England, worked for Brigham Young and made a variety of simple yet fashionable pieces. He crafted a few unique pieces, including an octagonal rotating desk with painted graining to simulate other textures, and a reclining chair. Ralph Ramsay, another Mormon pioneer furniture maker, used Bell's workshop to carve a large eagle that decorated the entrance to Brigham Young's property.&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt;{{rp|55}} Ramsay carved many other details iconic to Mormon architecture, including the original oxen supporting baptismal fonts in temples, the casework for the Salt Lake Tabernacle organ, and an ornate personal bed.&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt;{{rp|59–62}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Other pioneer craftsmen tried to adapt to conditions in Utah. Potters made jars and pots for local needs. Local soil was high in [[Alkali soil|alkali]], and traditional glazes were ineffective. Pioneers preferred the cheaper factory-made pottery, and by the end of the 19th century, only Erich C. Henrichsen's pottery remained in business, selling unglazed machine-made flower pots. Blacksmiths recycled any metal they could find and had consistent work to do, shoeing horses and repairing farm equipment. By the 1890s, most craftsmen were struggling to support themselves, as they could not compete with factory-made goods brought by the railway.&lt;ref name=Richards&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Nancy|editor1-last=Cannon|editor1-first=Hal|title=Utah Folk Art: A Catalog of Material Culture|publisher=Brigham Young University Press|page=76 |chapter=Mormon Craftsmen in Utah}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76}} Since the church's emphasis on emergency preparedness, some Mormons have created storage space for preserved food inside furniture.&lt;!--when did this practice start?--&gt;&lt;ref name="Thatcher" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berteaux|first1=Kelsey|title=Food Storage Strategies|url=http://www.ldsliving.com/Food-Storage-Strategies/s/73701|accessdate=11 May 2017|work=LDS Living|date=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
Rural Mormon settlements have several features that, when found together, distinguish them from non-Mormon settlements. These include wide roads, irrigation ditches, unpainted barns, and special wooden hay derricks.&lt;ref name="Mormondom as Regional" /&gt;{{rp|30; 44}} [[Populus nigra|Lombardy poplars]] were often grown in rows to act as a windbreak, and streets were often numbered in grid fashion.&lt;ref name=folklife /&gt; A two-story symmetrical home with a chimney on either end was popular, and called "I"-style or "Nauvoo"-style homes. "I"-style homes were often built adjoining one another in "L", "H", or "T" style homes. Homes were often built using adobe.&lt;ref name="Bradley" /&gt;

Brigham Young instructed pioneers to build "beautiful" houses, and from 1847–1890, architects experimented with various decorations they found in house pattern books. [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek revival]]-inspired decorations included window heads in pediment shape, [[entablature]], and plain [[cornice]] returns. For [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] decorations, architects used intricate [[bargeboard]]s and spired [[finial]]s to traditional house plans. Dormers were popular and were built in many varying styles. Late 19th-century styles like [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] were not common. Traditional house plans came from [[Georgian architecture#Colonial Georgian architecture|Colonial Georgian architecture]]. External designs were usually [[Symmetry in biology#Bilateral symmetry|bilaterally symmetric]], with three distinct components, one of which was centered to preserve symmetry. Second-story windows were built direct above first-story windows in this style. Architectural eclecticism was common, and architects sometimes used unusual solutions to create symmetric facades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Tom|editor1-last=Cannon|editor1-first=Hal|title=Utah Folk Art: A Catalog of Material Culture|publisher=Brigham Young University Press|page=44; 49 |chapter=Folk Design in Utah Architecture 1849–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Gravestones ===
In the 19th century, the most popular symbol for gravestones in the Mormon cultural region was that of two hands clasped, as if in a handshake. Carol Edison, former director of the Utah Art Council's Folk Arts Program, interprets the symbol as having multiple meanings, representing either a goodbye to living relatives or a greeting to deceased relatives.&lt;ref name=Edison&gt;{{cite book|last=Edison|first=Carol|editor1-last=Eliason|editor1-first=Eric A.|editor2-last=Mould|editor2-first=Tom|title=Latter-day lore: Mormon folklore studies|date=2013|isbn=978-1-60781-285-2|accessdate=1 May 2017 |url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/upcat/id/1884/rec/1 |chapter=Mormon Gravestones:A Folk Expression of Identity and Belief}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|83}} The clasped hands design was especially popular for upright marble grave markers. Starting around 1910, images of temples on gravestones appeared, reinforcing Mormon beliefs about families remaining together after death. With sandblasting technology in the 1960s, carving images of temples became much easier. Over a quarter of gravestone orders in 2013 included a temple image.&lt;ref name=Edison /&gt;{{rp|86}} Many temple gravestones include the names of husband and wife on the same gravestone and the date of their [[Sealing (Mormonism)|temple sealing]]. The names of the children of the couple are sometimes also listed on the gravestone, showing the importance of the family unit.&lt;ref name=Edison /&gt;{{rp|88}}

== Mormon fundamentalists ==
[[Mormon fundamentalism|Fundamentalist communities]] practice polygamy. A few sects practice arranged marriages, but it is "probably more common"&lt;ref name=folklife /&gt;{{rp|830}} for spouses to court a wife through religious persuasion. Fundamentalists describe their practice of polygamy as a vital part of their religious devotion. Family organization depends on individual style; in some families the first wife takes a superior role to the younger wives; in others, they are scrupulously treated equally. Traditional dances are popular, especially the [[double scottische]]. Modest but modern clothing is common. Fundamentalist communities strongly value frugal cooperative self-reliance, often [[home-schooling]] their children and relying on alternative medicine. Many families receive financial assistance from the government. Past government raids provide touchstones for communal memory, and members recount their own and their ancestors's experiences with persecution.&lt;ref name=folklife /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3009">'''PropBank''' is a [[text corpus|corpus]] that is [[annotation|annotated]] with verbal propositions and their arguments&amp;mdash;a "proposition bank". Although "PropBank" refers to a specific corpus produced by Martha Palmer ''et al.'',&lt;ref name=Palmer2005&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Palmer M, Kingsbury P, Gildea D |title=The Proposition Bank: An Annotated Corpus of Semantic Roles |journal=Computational Linguistics |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=71–106 |doi=10.1162/0891201053630264 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''propbank'' is also coming to be used as a [[common noun]] referring to any corpus that has been annotated with propositions and their arguments.

The PropBank project has played a role in recent{{When|date=October 2012}} research in [[natural language processing]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and has been used in [[semantic role labelling]].

==Comparison==

PropBank differs from [[FrameNet]], the resource to which it is most frequently compared, in several ways.

PropBank is a verb-oriented resource, while FrameNet is centered on the more abstract notion of frames, which generalizes descriptions across similar verbs (e.g. "describe" and "characterize") as well as nouns and other words (e.g. "description"). PropBank does not annotate events or states of affairs described using nouns. PropBank commits to annotating all verbs in a corpus, whereas the FrameNet project chooses sets of example sentences from a large corpus and only in a few cases has annotated longer continuous stretches of text.

PropBank-style annotations often remain close to the syntactic level, while FrameNet-style annotations are sometimes more semantically motivated. From the start, PropBank was developed with the idea of serving as training data for [[machine learning]]-based [[semantic role labeling]] systems in mind. It requires that all arguments to a verb be [[Constituent (linguistics)|syntactic constituents]] and different senses of a word are only distinguished if the differences bear on the arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://verbs.colorado.edu/~kipper/Papers/semlink_iwcs7.pdf |title= Combining Lexical Resources: Mapping Between PropBank and VerbNet|author1=Edward Loper |author2=Szu-ting Yi |author3=Martha Palmer  |last-author-amp=yes |date=2007|booktitle= Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Computational Linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to such differences, semantic role labeling with respect to PropBank is often a somewhat easier task than producing FrameNet-style annotations.

{{Music of Jamaica}}

'''Reggae''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|g|eɪ}}) is a [[music genre]] that originated in [[Jamaica]] in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its [[Jamaican diaspora|diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Davis. "Reggae." ''Grove Music Online''. ''Oxford Music          Online''. Oxford University Press. Web.16 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1968 single by [[Toots and the Maytals]], "[[Do the Reggay]]" was the first popular song to use the word "reggae," effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/frederick-toots-hibbert-10673303#acclaimed-musician |title=Frederick "Toots" Hibbert Biography |publisher=biography.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/reggae?s=t |title=reggae |publisher=Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. |date= |accessdate=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular [[Music of Jamaica|Jamaican dance music]], the term ''reggae'' more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional [[mento]] as well as American [[jazz]] and [[rhythm and blues]], especially the New Orleans R&amp;B practiced by [[Fats Domino]] and [[Allen Toussaint]], and evolved out of the earlier genres [[ska]] and [[rocksteady]].&lt;ref name="Return of Reggae"&gt;{{cite news|author=Geoffey Himes |title=Return of Reggae |publisher=The Washington Post |date=1979-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as ‘Rudie Blues’, then ‘Ska’, later ‘Blue Beat’, and ‘Rock Steady’.&lt;ref&gt;"Reggae." ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', 2nd ed. rev. Ed. Michael Kennedy. ''Oxford Music Online''.Oxford University Press. Web. 16 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section.

Reggae is deeply linked to the [[Rastafari]], an [[africa]]-centred religion which developed in Jamaica in the 1930's,  aiming at promoting [[Pan-Africanism|Pan Africanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warner|first=Keith Q.|date=1988|title=Calypso, reggae, and Rastafarianism: Authentic Caribbean voices|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/03007768808591306|journal=Popular Music and Society|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=53–62|doi=10.1080/03007768808591306|issn=0300-7766|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Earl|first=Bunn, Glenn|title=The Influence of Rastafarianism and Reggae Music on Jamaican and International Politics|date=2005|publisher=St. John Fisher College|url=https://fisherpub.sjfc.edu/intlstudies_masters/42/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Horace|date=1988|title=Rastafari as Pan Africanism in the Caribbean and Africa|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23500303|journal=African Journal of Political Economy / Revue Africaine d'Economie Politique|volume=2|issue=1|pages=75–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the [[Rastafari|Rastafarian]] movement appeared, the international popularity of reggae music became associated with and increased the visibility of Rastafarianism spreading the [[Rastafari]] gospel throughout the world. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Reggae music is an important means of transporting vital messages of [[Rastafarianism]].

Stylistically, reggae incorporates some of the musical elements  of [[rhythm and blues]], [[jazz]], [[mento]] (a celebratory, rural folk form that served its largely rural audience as dance music and an alternative to the hymns and adapted chanteys of local church singing),&lt;ref name="Grove Music Online"&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephen Davis |title=Reggae |publisher=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz |edition=second |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; calypso,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Rick. “Reggae Music: A History and Selective Discography”.

Reggae is noted for its tradition of social criticism and religion in its lyrics,&lt;ref name="It's About New Beginnings And Keeping the Faith"&gt;{{cite news|author=Ben Ratliff |title=It's About New Beginnings And Keeping the Faith |publisher=The New York Times |date=1999-09-20 |page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; although many reggae songs discuss lighter, more personal subjects, such as love and socializing.

Reggae has spread to many countries across the world, often incorporating local instruments and fusing with other genres. [[Reggae en Español]] spread from the Spanish speaking Central American country of Panama to the mainland South American countries of [[Venezuela]] and [[Guyana]] then to the rest of South America. [[Caribbean music in the United Kingdom]], including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, and has evolved into several subgenres and fusions. Many reggae artists began their careers in the UK, and there have been a number of European artists and bands drawing their inspiration directly from Jamaica and the Caribbean community in Europe. Reggae in Africa was boosted by the visit of [[Bob Marley]] to Zimbabwe in 1980. In Jamaica, authentic reggae is one of the biggest sources of income.&lt;ref&gt;Bennetzen, Jørgen, and Kirsten Maegaard. “Reggae”. ''Fontes Artis Musicae'' 29.4 (1982): 182–186.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The 1967 edition of the ''Dictionary of  [[Jamaican English]]'' lists ''reggae'' as "a recently estab. sp. for ''rege''", as in ''rege-rege'', a word that can mean either "rags, ragged clothing" or "a quarrel, a row".&lt;ref&gt;1967 ''Dictionary of Jamaican English''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Reggae'' as a musical term first appeared in print with the 1968 rocksteady hit "[[Do the Reggay]]" by [[Toots &amp; the Maytals|The Maytals]] which named the genre of Reggae for the world.

Reggae historian [[Steve Barrow]] credits [[Clancy Eccles]] with altering the [[Jamaican patois]] word  ''streggae'' (loose woman) into ''reggae''.&lt;ref name=NiceupHistory/&gt; However, [[Toots Hibbert]] said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There's a word we used to use in Jamaica called 'streggae'. If a girl is walking and the guys look at her and say 'Man, she's streggae' it means she don't dress well, she look raggedy. The girls would say that about the men too. This one morning me and my two friends were playing and I said, 'OK man, let's do the reggay.' It was just something that came out of my mouth. So we just start singing 'Do the reggay, do the reggay' and created a beat. People tell me later that we had given the sound its name.  Before that people had called it blue-beat and all kind of other things. Now it's in the Guinness World of Records.&lt;ref&gt;Sturges, Fiona (2004) "[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/frederick-toots-hibbert-the-reggae-king-of-kingston-731003.html Frederick "Toots" Hibbert: The reggae king of Kingston]", ''[[The Independent]]'', 4 June 2004, retrieved 11 December 2009; cf. many similar statements by Hibbert in recent years. In earlier interviews, Hibbert used to claim the derivation was from English 'regular', in reference to the beat.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Bob Marley]] is said to have claimed that the word ''reggae'' came from a Spanish term for "the king's music".&lt;ref&gt;''Catch a Fire: The Life of Bob Marley'', Timothy White, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The liner notes of ''To the King'', a compilation of Christian gospel reggae, suggest that the word ''reggae'' was derived from the Latin ''regi'' meaning "to the king".

==Precursors==
Although strongly influenced by traditional [[mento]] and [[calypso music]], as well as American [[jazz]] and [[rhythm and blues]], reggae owes its direct origins to the [[ska]] and [[rocksteady]] of 1960s Jamaica. The generic title for Jamaican music recorded between 1961 and 1967, ska emerged from Jamaican R&amp;B, which was based largely on American R&amp;B and doo-wop.&lt;ref&gt;"Ska." ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music'', 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. ''Oxford Music Online''. Oxford University Press. Web. 16 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Rastafari entered some countries primarily through reggae music; thus, the movement in these places is more stamped by its origins in reggae music and social milieu.&lt;ref&gt;Salter, Richard C.. “Sources and Chronology in Rastafari Origins”. ''Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions'' 9.1 (2005): 5–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rastafari movement]] was a significant influence on reggae, with [[Rastafarian|Rasta]] drummers like [[Count Ossie]] taking part in seminal recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zqKqiSGzxQUC&amp;pg=PA42 |title=Cut 'N' Mix: Culture, Identity, and Caribbean Music By Dick Hebdige |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the predecessors of reggae drumming is the [[Nyabinghi rhythm]], a style of ritual drumming performed as a communal meditative practice in the Rastafarian life.&lt;ref name="The significance of corporeal factors and choreographic rhythms in Jamaican popular music between 1957--1981 (Ska, Rocksteady, Reggae), with an historical and critical survey of all relevant literature dealing with Jamaican folk, religious and popular musics and dance"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonard Joseph McCarthy |title=The significance of corporeal factors and choreographic rhythms in Jamaican popular music between 1957--1981 (Ska, Rocksteady, Reggae), with an historical and critical survey of all relevant literature dealing with Jamaican folk, religious and popular musics and dance |date=2007 |accessdate=2015-02-22 |page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ska arose in Jamaican studios in the late 1950s, developing from American R&amp;B, [[mento]] and [[calypso music]].&lt;ref name=NiceupHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://niceup.com/history/ja_music_59-73.html |title=History of Jamaican Music 1953–1973 |publisher=Niceup.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ska is characterized by a quarter note [[walking bass]] line, guitar and piano [[On-beat|offbeats]], and a drum pattern with cross-stick snare and bass drum on the backbeat and open hi-hat on the offbeats (with nothing on beats one and three). It is also notable for its jazz-influenced horn riffs. Jamaica gained its independence in 1962, and ska became the music of choice for Jamaican youths seeking music that was their own. Ska also became popular among [[mod (subculture)|mods]] in Britain.

In the mid-1960s, Rocksteady emerged, a genre slower than ska featuring more romantic lyrics and less prominent horns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muther|first1=Christopher|title=The beat goes on: Ska and Reggae scene serves up sounds to suit every taste|url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/405360219.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+10%2C+2000&amp;author=Muther%2C+Christopher&amp;pub=Boston+Globe&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=11&amp;desc=THE+BEAT+GOES+ON+SKA+AND+REGGAE+SCENE+SERVES+UP+SOUNDS+TO+SUIT+EVERY+TASTE|accessdate=21 April 2017|work=The Boston Globe|date=10 August 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422035344/https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/405360219.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+10%2C+2000&amp;author=Muther%2C+Christopher&amp;pub=Boston+Globe&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=11&amp;desc=THE+BEAT+GOES+ON+SKA+AND+REGGAE+SCENE+SERVES+UP+SOUNDS+TO+SUIT+EVERY+TASTE|archive-date=2017-04-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was later solidified after the release of a single by [[Alton Ellis]]. There are many theories as to why Jamaican musicians slowed the ska tempo to create rocksteady; one is that the singer Hopeton Lewis was unable to sing his hit song "Take It Easy" at a ska tempo.&lt;ref name=NiceupHistory/&gt; Many rocksteady rhythms later were used as the basis of reggae recordings. The "double skank" guitar strokes on the offbeat were part of the new reggae style.

==History==
Reggae developed from [[ska]] and [[rocksteady]] in the 1960s. Larry And Alvin’s ‘Nanny Goat’ and the Beltones’ ‘No More Heartaches’ competed for the status of first reggae record. The beat was distinctive from rocksteady in that it dropped any of the pretensions to the smooth, soulful sound that characterized slick American R&amp;B, and instead was closer in kinship to US southern funk, being heavily dependent on the rhythm section to drive it along. Reggae’s great advantage was its almost limitless flexibility: from the early, jerky sound of Lee Perry’s ‘People Funny Boy’, to the uptown sounds of Third World’s ‘Now That We’ve Found Love’, it was an enormous leap through the years and styles, yet both are instantly recognizable as reggae.&lt;ref&gt;"Reggae." ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music'', 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. ''Oxford Music Online''. Oxford University Press. Web. 16 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  The shift from rocksteady to reggae was illustrated by the organ [[Swung note|shuffle]] pioneered by Jamaican musicians like [[Jackie Mittoo]] and Winston Wright and featured in transitional singles "Say What You're Saying" (1968) by [[Eric "Monty" Morris]] and "People Funny Boy" (1968) by [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]]. [[The Pioneers (band)|The Pioneers]]' 1968 track "Long Shot (Bus' Me Bet)" has been identified as the earliest recorded example of the new rhythm sound that became known as reggae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upsetter.net/scratch/biography01.htm |title=Shocks Of Mighty: An Upsetting Biography |publisher=Upsetter.net |date=1936-03-20 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jimmy_Cliff_-_Festival_du_Bout_du_Monde_2012_-_022.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Jimmy Cliff]].]]
Early 1968 was when the first ''bona fide'' reggae records were released: "Nanny Goat" by [[Larry Marshall (singer)|Larry Marshall]] and "No More Heartaches" by The Beltones. That same year, the newest Jamaican sound began to spawn big-name imitators in other countries. American artist [[Johnny Nash]]'s 1968 hit "Hold Me Tight" has been credited with first putting reggae in the American listener charts. Around the same time, reggae influences were starting to surface in [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]], one example being 1968's "[[Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da]]" by [[The Beatles]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin O'Brien Chang, 1998, ''Reggae Routes'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Wailers (1963–1974 band)|The Wailers]], a band started by [[Bob Marley]], [[Peter Tosh]] and [[Bunny Wailer]] in 1963, is perhaps the most recognized band that made the transition through all three stages of early Jamaican popular music: ska, rocksteady and reggae. Over a dozen Wailers songs are based on or use a line from Jamaican mento songs. In 1951, recordings of mento music began to be released. These recordings showcased two styles of mento: an acoustic, rural style and a jazzy, popular style.&lt;ref&gt;Garnice, Michael. "Bob Marley and the Wailers' Mento Roots." Beat 25.2 (2006): p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; Other significant reggae pioneers include [[Prince Buster]], [[Desmond Dekker]] and [[Ken Boothe]].

However, another pioneer was [[Millie Small]] (born 6 October 1946),&lt;ref name="amg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/millie-small-mn0000489606/biography|title=Millie Small - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Jamaica]]n [[singer-songwriter]], best known for her 1964 blue-beat/ska [[cover version]] of "[[My Boy Lollipop]]" which was a smash hit internationally.

Notable Jamaican producers influential in the development of ska into rocksteady and reggae include: [[Coxsone Dodd]], [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]], [[Leslie Kong]], [[Duke Reid]], [[Joe Gibbs (record producer)|Joe Gibbs]] and [[King Tubby]]. [[Chris Blackwell]], who founded [[Island Records]] in Jamaica in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;Sexton, Paul. “A Legend in His Own Time.” Billboard - The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment 113.39 (29 Sep. 2001): p. C-8.&lt;/ref&gt; relocated to England in 1962, where he continued to promote Jamaican music. He formed a partnership with Lee Gopthal's [[Trojan Records]] in 1968, which released reggae in the UK until bought by Saga records in 1974.

Reggae's influence bubbled to the top of the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] charts in late 1972. First [[Three Dog Night]] hit #1 in September with a cover of [[the Maytones]]' version of "[[Black and White (Three Dog Night song)|Black and White]]". Then [[Johnny Nash]] was at #1 for four weeks in November with "[[I Can See Clearly Now]]". [[Paul Simon]]'s single "[[Mother And Child Reunion]]" - a track which he recorded in Kingston, Jamaica with [[Jimmy Cliff]]'s backing group - was ranked by Billboard as the No. 57 song of 1972.

In 1973, the film ''[[The Harder They Come]]'' starring [[Jimmy Cliff]] was released and introduced Jamaican music to cinema audiences outside Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;Steffens, Roger. ‘The Harder They Come: 30 Years After.” The Beat 22.1 (2003): p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Though the film achieved cult status its limited appeal meant that it had a smaller impact than [[Eric Clapton]]'s 1974 cover of Bob Marley's "[[I Shot the Sheriff]]" which made it onto the playlists of mainstream rock and pop radio stations worldwide. Clapton's "I Shot The Sheriff" used modern rock production and recording techniques and faithfully retained most of the original reggae elements; it was a breakthrough pastiche devoid of any parody and played an important part in bringing the music of Bob Marley to a wider rock audience.&lt;ref name=NiceupHistory/&gt; By the mid-1970s, authentic reggae dub plates and specials were getting some exposure in the UK on [[John Peel]]'s radio show, who promoted the genre for the rest of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Gaar, Gillian G. “The Beat goes on.” Goldmine 38.14 (Dec 2012): p. 26-29&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, British filmmaker [[Jeremy Marre]] documented the Jamaican music scene in ''Roots Rock Reggae'', capturing the heyday of [[Roots reggae]].&lt;ref&gt;RHYTHM OF RESISTANCE ROOTS, ROCK, REGGAE SALSA KONKOMBE

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the UK [[punk rock]] scene flourished, and reggae was a notable influence. The DJ [[Don Letts]] would play reggae and punk tracks at clubs such as [[The Roxy (London)|The Roxy]]. Punk bands such as [[The Clash]], [[The Ruts]], [[The Members]] and [[The Slits]] played many reggae-influenced songs. Around the same time, reggae music took a new path in the UK; one that was created by the multiracial makeup of England's inner cities and exemplified by groups like [[Steel Pulse]], [[Aswad (band)|Aswad]] and [[UB40]], as well as artists such as [[Smiley Culture]] and [[Carroll Thompson]]. The Jamaican ghetto themes in the lyrics were replaced with UK [[inner city]] themes, and Jamaican [[patois]] became intermingled with [[Cockney]] slang. In South London around this time, a new subgenre of [[Lovers Rock]], was being created. Unlike the Jamaican music of the same name which was mainly dominated by male artists such as [[Gregory Isaacs]], the South London genre was led by female singers like Thompson and [[Janet Kay]]. The UK Lovers Rock had a softer  and more commercial sound.Other reggae artists who enjoyed international appeal in the early 1980s include [[Third World (band)|Third World]], [[Black Uhuru]] and [[Sugar Minott]]. The Grammy Awards introduced the [[Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album]] category in 1985.

Women also play a role in the reggae music industry personnel such as Olivia Grange, president of Specs-Shang Musik; Trish Farrell, president of Island/Jamaica; Lisa Cortes, president of Loose Cannon; Jamaican-American Sharon Gordon, who has worked in the independent reggae music industry.&lt;ref&gt;Oumano, E.

=== Reggae heritage ===
In November 2018 "reggae music of Jamaica" was added to the [[UNESCO|UNESCO's]] [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] the decision recognised reggae's "contribution to international discourse on issues of injustice, resistance, love and humanity underscores the dynamics of the element as being at once cerebral, socio-political, sensual and spiritual."&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt;

===== Reggae Month in Jamaica =====
Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding made February 2008 the first annual Reggae Month in Jamaica. To celebrate, the Recording Industry Association of Jamaica (RIAJam) held its first Reggae Academy Awards on February 24, 2008. In addition, Reggae Month included a six-day Global Reggae conference, a reggae film festival, two radio station award functions, and a concert tribute to the late Dennis Brown, who Bob Marley cited as his favorite singer. On the business side, RIAJam held events focused on reggae's employment opportunities and potential international revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Meschino, P. (2008, Mar 15).

Stylistically, reggae incorporates some of the musical elements of [[rhythm and blues]] (R&amp;B), [[jazz]], [[mento]], [[calypso music|calypso]], African, and Latin American music, as well as other genres. Reggae scenes consist of two guitars, one for rhythm and one for lead—drums, congas, and keyboards, with a couple vocalists.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, V. M. (1973, Feb 18). Sound. ''Chicago Tribune (1963-Current File)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Reggae is played in [[time signature|{{music|time|4|4}} time]] because the symmetrical rhythmic pattern does not lend itself to other time signatures such as {{music|time|3|4}}. One of the most easily recognizable elements is offbeat rhythms; staccato chords played by a guitar or piano (or both) on the offbeats of the measure, often referred to as the [[Ska stroke|skank]].&lt;ref&gt;Hombach, Jean-Pierre (2010). ''Bob Marley the Father of Music'', p.14. {{ISBN|9781471620454}}. "Reggae is most easily recognized by...the skank."&lt;/ref&gt;

This rhythmic pattern accents the second and fourth beats in each [[bar (music)|bar]] and combines with the drum's emphasis on beat three to create a unique sense of phrasing. The reggae offbeat can be counted so that it falls between each count as an "and" (example: 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and, etc.) or counted as a half-time feel at twice the tempo so it falls on beats 2 and 4. This is in contrast to the way most other popular genres focus on beat one, the "downbeat".&lt;ref&gt;Levitin, Daniel J. (2006). ''[[This Is Your Brain On Music]]'', pp. 113-114 {{ISBN|978-0-452-28852-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tempo of reggae is usually slower than [[ska]] but faster than [[rocksteady]].&lt;ref name="All About Jazz"/&gt; It is this slower tempo, the guitar/piano offbeats, the emphasis on the third beat, and the use of [[Syncopation|syncopated]], melodic bass lines that differentiate reggae from other music, although other musical styles have incorporated some of these innovations.

Harmonically the music is essentially the same as any other modern popular genre with a tendency to make use of simple [[chord (music)|chord]] progressions. Reggae sometimes uses the dominant chord in its minor form therefore never allowing a perfect cadence to be sounded; this lack of resolution between the tonic and the dominant imparts a sense of movement "without rest" and harmonic ambiguity. Extended chords like the [[major seventh chord]] ("[[Waiting in Vain]]" by [[Bob Marley]]) and [[minor seventh chord]] are used though suspended chords or diminished chords are rare. Minor keys are commonly used especially with the minor chord forms of the subdominant and dominant chord (for example in the key of G minor the progression may be played Gm – Dm – Gm – Dm – Cm – Dm – Cm – Dm). A simple progression borrowed from [[rhythm and blues]] and [[soul music]] is the tonic chord followed by the minor supertonic chord with the two chords repeated continuously to form a complete verse ("[[Just My Imagination]]" by [[The Temptations]] C – Dm&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;).

The concept of "call and response" can be found throughout reggae music, in the vocals but also in the way parts are composed and arranged for each instrument. The emphasis on the "third beat" of the bar also results in a different sense of musical phrasing, with bass lines and melody lines often emphasizing what might be considered "pick up notes" in other genres.

===Drums and other percussion===
A standard drum kit is generally used in reggae, but the [[snare drum]] is often tuned very high to give it a [[timbales]]-type sound. Some reggae drummers use an additional timbale or high-tuned snare to get this sound.  Cross-stick technique on the snare drum is commonly used, and [[tom-tom drums]] are often incorporated into the drumbeat itself.
[[File:RobbieShakespeare1978.png|thumb|upright|Robbie Shakespeare]]
Reggae [[drumbeats]] fall into three main categories: ''[[One drop rhythm|One drop]]'', ''Rockers'', and ''Steppers''. With the ''One drop'', the emphasis is entirely on the backbeat (usually on the snare, or as a rim shot combined with bass drum). Beat one is empty except for a closed high hat commonly used, which is unusual in popular music. There is some controversy about whether reggae should be counted so that this beat falls on two and four, or whether it should be counted twice as fast, so it falls on three. An example played by Barrett can be heard in the [[Bob Marley and the Wailers]] song "One Drop". Barrett often used an unusual [[irrational rhythm|triplet]] [[polyrhythm|cross-rhythm]] on the [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]], which can be heard on many recordings by Bob Marley and the Wailers, such as "Running Away" on the ''[[Kaya (album)|Kaya]]'' album.

[[File:SlyDunbar1979.png|thumb|left|Sly Dunbar]]
An emphasis on the backbeat is found in all reggae drumbeats, but with the ''Rockers'' beat, the emphasis is on all four beats of the bar (usually on bass drum). This beat was pioneered by [[Sly and Robbie]], who later helped create the "Rub-a-Dub" sound that greatly influenced dancehall. Sly has stated he was influenced to create this style by listening to American drummer Earl Young as well as other disco and R&amp;B drummers in the early to mid-1970s, as stated in the book "Wailing Blues". The prototypical example of the style is found in [[Sly Dunbar]]'s drumming on "Right Time" by the Mighty Diamonds. The ''Rockers'' beat is not always straightforward, and various [[syncopation]]s are often included. An example of this is the [[Black Uhuru]] song "Sponji Reggae".

In ''Steppers'', the bass drum plays every quarter beat of the bar, giving the beat an insistent drive. An example is "Exodus" by Bob Marley and the Wailers. Another common name for the ''Steppers'' beat is the "four on the floor". [[Burning Spear]]'s 1975 song "Red, Gold, and Green" (with Leroy Wallace on drums) is one of the earliest examples. The ''Steppers'' beat was adopted (at a much higher tempo) by some [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] [[ska]] revival bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s.

An unusual characteristic of reggae drumming is that the drum fills often do not end with a climactic cymbal. A wide range of other percussion instrumentation are used in reggae. [[Bongo drum|Bongos]] are often used to play free, improvised patterns, with heavy use of African-style [[cross-rhythm]]s. Cowbells, [[claves]] and shakers tend to have more defined roles and a set pattern.

Reggae drummers often involved these three tips for other reggae performers: (1) go for open, ringing tones when playing ska and rocksteady, (2) use any available material to stuff the bass drum so that it tightens up the kick to a deep, punchy thud, and (3) go without a ride cymbal, focusing on the hi-hat for timekeeping and thin crashes with fast decay for accents.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, M. (2012, 08). Jamaican drum sounds. ''Modern Drummer, 36'', 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bass===
[[File:Aston Barret on stage 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Aston Barret]]
The [[bass guitar]] often plays the dominant role in reggae, and the drum and bass is often the most important part of what is called, in Jamaican music, a ''[[riddim]]'' (rhythm), a (usually simple) piece of music that's used repeatedly by different artists to write and record songs with. Literally hundreds of reggae singers have released different songs recorded over the same rhythm. The central role of the bass can be particularly heard in [[dub music]] — which gives an even bigger role to the drum and bass line, reducing the vocals and other instruments to peripheral roles.

The bass sound in reggae is thick and heavy, and [[equalization (audio)|equalized]] so the upper frequencies are removed and the lower frequencies emphasized. The bass line is often a repeated two or four bar [[riff]] when simple chord progressions are used. The simplest example of this might be Robbie Shakespeare's bass line for the Black Uhuru hit "Shine Eye Gal". In the case of more complex harmonic structures, such as [[John Holt (singer)|John Holt]]'s version of "Stranger In Love", these simpler patterns are altered to follow the chord progression either by directly moving the pattern around or by changing some of the interior notes in the phrase to better support the chords.

===Guitars===
[[File:Al Anderson1978.png|thumb|upright|Al Anderson]]
The [[guitar]] in reggae usually plays on the off beat of the rhythm. So if one is counting in {{music|time|4|4}} time and counting 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +, one would play a downstroke on the "and" part of the beat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reggaeguitarlessons.com/|title=Reggae Guitar Lessons|website=Reggae Guitar Lessons|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A musical figure known as [[skank (guitar)|skank]] or the 'bang" has a very dampened, short and scratchy [[chop chord|chop]] sound, almost like a percussion instrument. Sometimes a double chop is used when the guitar still plays the off beats, but also plays the following eighth-note beats on the up-stroke. An example is the intro to "[[Stir It Up]]" by The Wailers. Artist and producer [[Derrick Harriott]] says, “What happened was the musical thing was real widespread, but only among a certain sort of people. It was always a down-town thing, but more than just hearing the music. The equipment was so powerful and the vibe so strong that we feel it.”&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Lloyd. ''This Is Reggae Music:The Story Of Jamaica's Music.'' New York:Grove Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keyboards===
From the earliest days of Ska recordings, a piano was used to double the rhythm guitar's skank, playing the [[chord (music)|chords]] in a ''[[staccato]]'' style to add body, and playing occasional extra beats, runs and riffs. The piano part was widely taken over by [[synthesizer]]s during the 1980s, although synthesizers have been used in a peripheral role since the 1970s to play incidental melodies and [[countermelodies]]. Larger bands may include either an additional keyboardist, to cover or replace [[brass instrument|horn]] and [[melody]] lines, or the main keyboardist filling these roles on two or more keyboards.

The reggae organ-shuffle is unique to reggae. In the original version of reggae, the drummer played a reggae groove that was used in the four bar introduction, allowing the piano to serve as a percussion instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, A. (2006, Summer). Jazz piano stylings: A contemporary approach. ''Piano Today, 26'', 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a [[Hammond organ]]-style sound is used to play chords with a choppy feel. This is known as the ''bubble''. This may be the most difficult reggae keyboard rhythm. The organ bubble can be broken down into 2 basic patterns. In the first, the 8th beats are played with a space-left-right-left-space-left-right-left pattern, where the spaces represent downbeats not played—that and the left-right-left falls on the ee-and-a, or and-2-and if counted at double time. In the second basic pattern, the left hand plays a double chop as described in the guitar section while the right hand plays longer notes on beat 2 (or beat 3 if counted at double time) or a syncopated pattern between the double chops. Both these patterns can be expanded on and improvised embellishments are sometimes used.

===Horns===
Horn sections are frequently used in reggae, often playing introductions and counter-melodies. Instruments included in a typical reggae horn section include saxophone, trumpet or trombone. In more recent times, real horns are sometimes replaced in reggae by [[synthesizer]]s or recorded samples. The horn section is often arranged around the first horn, playing a simple melody or counter melody. The first horn is usually accompanied by the second horn playing the same melodic phrase in unison, one octave higher. The third horn usually plays the melody an octave and a fifth higher than the first horn. The horns are generally played fairly softly, usually resulting in a soothing sound. However, sometimes punchier, louder phrases are played for a more up-tempo and aggressive sound.

===Vocals===
[[File:Ali Campbell at Raggamuffin 2009 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[UB40]]'s former frontman [[Ali Campbell]] performing in 2009.]]
The vocals in reggae are less of a defining characteristic of the genre than the instrumentation and rhythm, as almost any song can be performed in a reggae style. However, it is very common for reggae to be sung in [[Jamaican Patois]], [[Jamaican English]], and [[Iyaric]] dialects. Vocal harmony parts are often used, either throughout the melody (as with vocal groups such as the [[Mighty Diamonds]]), or as a counterpoint to the main vocal line (as with the backing vocalists, the [[I-Threes]]). More complex vocal arrangements can be found in the works of groups like [[The Abyssinians]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] reggae band [[Steel Pulse]].

An unusual aspect of reggae singing is that many singers use ''[[tremolo]]'' (volume oscillation) rather than ''[[vibrato]]'' (pitch oscillation). Notable exponents of this technique include [[Horace Andy]] and vocal group [[Israel Vibration]]. The [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]] vocal style is unique to reggae, originating when [[disc jockey|DJs]] improvised spoken introductions to songs (or "toasts") to the point where it became a distinct rhythmic vocal style, and is generally considered to be a precursor to [[hip hop music|rap]]. It differs from rap mainly in that it is generally melodic, while rap is generally more a spoken form without melodic content.

====Lyrical themes====
Reggae is noted for its tradition of social criticism in its lyrics, although many reggae songs discuss lighter, more personal subjects, such as love and socializing. Many early reggae bands covered [[Motown]] or [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] soul and [[funk]] songs. Some reggae lyrics attempt to raise the political consciousness of the audience, such as by criticizing [[Economic materialism|materialism]], or by informing the listener about controversial subjects such as [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]]. Many reggae songs promote the use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] (also known as ''herb'', ''ganja'', or ''sinsemilla''), considered a sacrament in the [[Rastafari movement#Reggae|Rastafari movement]]. There are many artists who utilize religious themes in their music — whether it be discussing a specific religious topic, or simply giving praise to God ([[Jah]]). Other common socio-political topics in reggae songs include [[black nationalism]], [[anti-racism]], anti-[[colonialism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manioc.org/fichiers/HASH5cd4cf20c65d4a87ecfcf5 |title=The 1970's Reggae Revolution: resistance against Western Imperialism by Jeremie Kroubo-Dagnini |publisher=Manioc.org |date=2010-01-21 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[anti-capitalism]] and criticism of political systems and [[Rastafarian vocabulary#Other words|"Babylon"]].

In recent years, Jamaican (and non-Jamaican) reggae musicians have used more positive themes in reggae music. The music is widely considered a treasured cultural export for Jamaica, so musicians who still desire progress for their island nation have begun focusing on themes of hopefulness, faith, and love. For elementary children, reggae songs such as "Give a Little Love," "One Love," or "Three Little Birds," all written by Bob Marley, can be sung and enjoyed for their optimism and cheerful lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Susan W. "Reggae For Standards-Based Music Learning." ''General Music Today'' 17.1 (2003): 11-17. ''Music Index''. Web. 15 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of dancehall and ragga lyrics====
{{See also|Stop Murder Music}}
The wide cultural exposure which has enhanced the recognizability of reggae has been achieved primarily through a corporate commercialization effected at the expense of both the lyrical and instrumental essence of the music. This process has involved coerced or voluntary assimilation of more commercially compatible characteristics, appropriation by white mainstream artists, and an overall dispersal of ideological and musical meaning and creative value.The mainstream Euro-American audience has continually demonstrated a propensity for adopting reggae-oriented material on the basis of its aesthetically pleasing surface qualities rather than for explicitly political or deeper musical content, causing authenticity problems for reggae fans.&lt;ref&gt;Alleyne, M. (2000). White reggae: Cultural dilution in the record industry. ''Popular Music and Society, 24''(1), 15-30.

Some dancehall and ragga artists have been criticised for [[homophobia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towleroad.com/2007/06/reggae_stars_re.html |title=Reggae Stars Renounce Homophobia, Condemn Anti-gay Violence |publisher=Towleroad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; including threats of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Most Homophobic Place on Earth?|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1182991,00.html|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=2006-04-12|accessdate= June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buju Banton]]'s song "Boom Bye-Bye" states that gays "haffi dead". Other notable dancehall artists who have been accused of homophobia include [[Elephant Man (musician)|Elephant Man]], [[Bounty Killer]] and [[Beenie Man]]. The controversy surrounding anti-gay lyrics has led to the cancellation of UK tours by Beenie Man and Sizzla. Toronto, Canada has also seen the cancellation of concerts due to artists such as Elephant Man and Sizzla refusing to conform to similar censorship pressures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/.../elephant-man-concert-dropped.html] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dancehall.mobi/2009/04/09/sizzla-refuses-to-bow-toronto-show-cancelled/ |title=Sizzla Refuses To ‘Bow’ – Toronto Show Cancelled |publisher=Dancehall.mobi |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202221302/https://www.dancehall.mobi/2009/04/09/sizzla-refuses-to-bow-toronto-show-cancelled/ |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===
[[File:Coachella TATM.jpg|thumb|[[Toots and the Maytals]] performing at the 2017 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella festival]]]]
[[Reggae en Español]] spread from mainland South American Caribbean from [[Venezuela]] and [[Guyana]] to the rest of South America.  It does not have any specific characteristics other than being sung in Spanish, usually by artists of Latin American origin. [[Samba reggae]] originated in [[Brazil]] as a blend of [[samba]] with Jamaican reggae. Reggae also has a presence in [[Veracruz]], [[Mexico]]. The most notable [[Jarocho]] reggae group being Los Aguas Aguas from [[Xalapa]]. Some of the most popular reggae groups across Latin America come from the Southern Cone, such as the Chilean band [[Gondwana (band)|Gondwana]], and the Argentinian band Los Cafres. The Puerto Rican band [[Cultura Profética]] is also widely recognized in the region. Hispanic reggae includes three elements: the incorporation of the Spanish language; the use of translations and versions based on known riddims and background music; and regional consciousness. It is a medium of rebellious contestation rising from the underground. Hispanic reggae is related to rap, sharing characteristics that can be found not only in the social conditions in which they developed in the region but also in the characteristics of social sectors and classes that welcome them.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, S. F. (2009). Reggae in cuba and the hispanic caribbean: Fluctuations and representations of identities. ''Black Music Research Journal, 29''(1), 25-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian samba-reggae utilized themes such as the U.S. African-American civil rights movement and the Black Soul movement, and especially the Jamaican independence movement since the 1960s and its messages in reggae and Rastafarianism. Thus, the sudden popularity of reggae music and musicians in Bahia, Brazil, was not the result of the effects of the transnational music industry, but of the need to establish cultural and political links with black communities across the Americas that had faced and were facing similar sociopolitical situations.&lt;ref&gt;Béhague, G. (2006). Globalization/Modernization - rap, reggae, rock, or samba: The local and the global in brazilian popular music (1985-95). ''Latin American Music Review/Revista De Música Latinoamericana, 27''(1), 79-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Musically, it was the bloco afro Olodum and its lead percussionist, Neguinho do Samba, that began to combine the basic samba beat of the blocos with merengue, salsa, and reggae rhythms and debuted their experimentations in the carnival of 1986. The new toques (drumming patterns) were labeled "samba-reggae" and consisted basically of a pattern in which the surdo bass drums (four of them at the minimum) divided themselves into four or five interlocking parts.

In the state of [[Maranhão]], in northeastern [[Brazil]], reggae is a very popular rhythm. [[São Luís, Maranhão|São Luis]], the state capital, is known as the Brazilian Jamaica. The city has more than 200 "radiolas", name given to sound teams formed by DJs and sound systems with dozens of powerful amplifiers boxes stacked. Reggae in Maranhão has its own characteristics, such as melody and the way of dancing, as well as having its own radio and television programs. In 2018, the [[:pt:Museu_do_Reggae_do_Maranhão|Reggae Museum of Maranhão]] was inaugurated, the second reggae museum in the world (after [[Jamaica]]), with the objective of preserving the reggae culture history in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://oimparcial.com.br/cultura/2018/01/museu-do-reggae-esta-aberto-ao-publico/|title=Museu do Reggae está aberto ao público {{!}} O Imparcial|date=2018-01-22|work=O Imparcial|access-date=2018-05-03|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, bands like [[Rebelution (band)|Rebelution]], [[Slightly Stoopid]], [[Stick Figure]], and [[SOJA]] are considered progressive reggae bands sometimes referred to as [[Cali Reggae]] or Pacific Dub. The American reggae scene is heavily centred in [[Southern California]], with large scenes also in [[New York City]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Chicago]], [[Miami]], and [[Honolulu]].

===Europe===
The UK was a primary destination for Caribbean people looking to emigrate as early as the 1950s. Because of this, [[Caribbean music in the United Kingdom]], including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, and has evolved into several subgenres and fusions. Most notable of these is [[lovers rock]], but this fusion of Jamaican music into English culture was seminal in the formation of other musical forms like [[drum and bass]] and [[dubstep]]. The UK became the base from which many Jamaican artists toured Europe and due to the large number of Jamaican musicians emigrating there, the UK is the root of the larger European scene that exists today. Many of the world's most famous reggae artists began their careers in UK. Singer and Grammy Award-winning reggae artist [[Maxi Priest]] began his career with seminal British sound system [[Saxon Studio International]].

Three reggae-tinged singles from [[the Police]]'s 1978 debut album, ''[[Outlandos d'Amour]]'', laid down the template for the basic structure of a lot of rock/reggae songwriting: a reggae-infused verse containing upstrokes on guitar or keyboards and a more aggressive, on-the-beat punk/rock attack during the chorus. The end of the 1970s featured a ska revival in the UK. By the end of the '70s, a revival movement had begun in England, with such bands as the Specials, Madness, the (English) Beat, and the Selecter. The Specials' leader and keyboardist, [[Jerry Dammers]], founded the 2 Tone record label, which released albums from the aforementioned racially integrated groups and was instrumental in creating a new social and cultural awareness. The 2 Tone movement referenced reggae's godfathers, popular styles (including the genre's faster and more dance-oriented precursors, ska and rocksteady), and previous modes of dress (such as black suits and porkpie hats) but updated the sound with a faster tempo, more guitar, and more attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Stemkovsky, I.

[[Birmingham]] based reggae/[[pop music]] band [[UB40]] were main contributors to the British reggae scene throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The achieved international success with hits such as "[[Red Red Wine]]," "[[Kingston Town (song)|Kingston Town]]" and "[[Can't Help Falling in Love#UB40 version|(I can't Help) Falling in Love with You]]."

Other UK based artists that had international impact include [[Aswad (band)|Aswad]], [[Misty In Roots]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Janet Kay]], [[Tippa Irie]], [[Smiley Culture]] and more recently [[Bitty McLean]]. There have been a number of European artists and bands drawing their inspiration directly from Jamaica and the Caribbean community in Europe, whose music and vocal styles are almost identical to contemporary Jamaican music. The best examples might be [[Alborosie]] (Italy) and [[Gentleman (musician)|Gentleman]] (Germany). Both Gentleman and Alborosie have had a significant chart impact in Jamaica, unlike many European artists. They have both recorded and released music in Jamaica for Jamaican labels and producers and are popular artists, likely to appear on many [[riddim]]s. Alborosie has lived in Jamaica since the late 1990s and has recorded at Bob Marley's famous [[Tuff Gong]] Studios. Since the early 1990s, several Italian reggae bands have emerged, including Africa Unite, [[Gaudi (musician)|Gaudi]], Reggae National Tickets, [[Sud Sound System]], [[Pitura Freska]] and [[B.R. Stylers]]. Another Italian famous reggae singer was [[Rino Gaetano]].

Reggae appeared on the [[Popular music in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav popular music scene]] in the late 1970s, through sporadic songs by popular [[rock music|rock]] acts.&lt;ref name="trecisvijet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trecisvijet.wordpress.com/2016/06/08/grad-zvani-vavilon-reggae-na-balkanu/|title=Grad zvani Vavilon – Reggae na Balkanu|date=8 June 2016|website=Trecisvijet.wordpress.com|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reggae saw an expansion with the emergence of [[New wave music in Yugoslavia|Yugoslav new wave scene]].&lt;ref name="trecisvijet"/&gt; The bands like [[Haustor]], [[Šarlo Akrobata]],  [[Aerodrom (band)|Aerodrom]], [[Laboratorija Zvuka]], [[Piloti (band)|Piloti]], [[Du Du A]] and others recorded reggae and reggae-influence songs.&lt;ref name="trecisvijet"/&gt; In the mid-1980s appeared [[Del Arno Band]], often considered the first real reggae band in Yugoslavia. Throughout the following decades they remained one of the most popular and influential reggae bands in the region.&lt;ref name="trecisvijet"/&gt; In the 1990s and early 2000s, after the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], appeared a new generation of reggae bands, like [[Serbia]]n band [[Eyesburn]], which gained popularity with their combination of reggae with [[hardcore punk]] and [[crossover thrash]], and [[Croatia]]n band Radikal Dub Kolektiv, alongside bands which incorporated reggae into their sound, like [[Darkwood Dub]], [[Kanda, Kodža i Nebojša]] and [[Lira Vega]] in Serbia and [[Dubioza Kolektiv]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref name="trecisvijet"/&gt; Late 2000s and 2010s brought a new generation of reggae acts in the region.&lt;ref name="trecisvijet"/&gt;

The first homegrown [[Polish reggae]] bands started in the 1980s with groups like [[Izrael (band)|Izrael]]ario. Singer and songwriter [[Alexander Barykin]] was considered as the father of Russian reggae.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20080930011306/http://www.superstar.su/players/22/ Superstar 2008. Team of USSR ALEXANDER BARYKIN]&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden, [[Uppsala Reggae Festival]] attracts attendees from across Northern Europe, and features Swedish reggae bands such as [[Rootvälta]] and [[Svenska Akademien (band)|Svenska Akademien]] as well as many popular Jamaican artists. [[Summerjam]], Europe's biggest reggae festival, takes place in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]] and sees crowds of 25,000 or more. [[Rototom Sunsplash]], a week-long festival which used to take place in [[Osoppo]], [[Italy]], until 2009, is now held in [[Benicassim]], [[Spain]] and gathers up to 150,000 visitors every year.

In Iceland reggae band [[Hjálmar]] is well established having released six CDs in Iceland. They were the first reggae band in Iceland, but few Icelandic artists had written songs in the reggae style before their showing up at the Icelandic music scene. The Icelandic reggae scene is expanding and growing at a fast rate. RVK Soundsystem is the first Icelandic [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound system]], counting 5 DJ's. They hold reggae nights in Reykjavík every month at clubs Hemmi og Valdi and more recently in Faktorý as the crowd has grown so much.

In Germany, the three successful Reggae JSnrfti mer Jam open-air fastivals were crucial parts of the renaissance of Caribbean music in Germany but at that year (1990) war broke out between the two main German promoters who had cooperated so well during the previous seasons. With a lot of infighting and personal quarrels, each of them pursued his own preparations for a big summer festival. The result was that two open-air events look place on the same day.

The Reggae Sammer Jam '90 was staged as usual, but this year for only one day. The event took place at the Lorelei Rock amphit heater with artists like Mad Professor's Ariwa Posse with Macka B and Kofi, Mutabaruka, the Mighty Diamonds, the Twinkle Brothers, Manu Dibango and Fela Kuti.

The other, ex-partner of the onceunited promoters succeeded in bringing the original Sunsplash package to Germany for the first time. Close to the Main River in the little village of Gemaunden deep down in rural southcentral Germany, they staged a two-day festival that drew the bigger crowd. About 10,000 people came from all over the country as well as from neighboring states like trance and, for the first time, East Germany to see the lineup of top reggae artists.&lt;ref&gt;Habekost, C.

===Africa===
Reggae in Africa was much boosted by the visit of Bob Marley to Zimbabwe on Independence Day 18 April 1980. [[Nigerian reggae]] had developed in the 1970s with artists such as [[Majek Fashek]] proving popular.  In [[South Africa]], reggae music has played a unifying role amongst cultural groups in [[Cape Town]]. During the years of [[Apartheid]], the music bonded people from all demographic groups. [[Lucky Dube]] recorded 25 albums, fusing reggae with [[Mbaqanga]]. The Marcus Garvey Rasta camp in Phillipi is regarded by many to be the reggae and [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] center of Cape Town. Reggae bands play regularly at community centres such as the Zolani center in [[Nyanga, Cape Town|Nyanga]].

In [[Uganda]] musician [[Papa Cidy]] is very popular. Arthur Lutta is also a [[Ugandan]] gospel reggae drummer known for his reggae style drumminng. In [[Ethiopia]], Dub Colossus and Invisible System emerged in 2008 sharing core members, and have received wide acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cibula |first=Matt |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/165332-why-2012-is-the-year-of-ethiopian-hybrid-music/ |title=Why 2012 Is the Year of Ethiopian Hybrid Music |publisher=PopMatters |date=2013-01-07 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12582-a-town-called-addis/ |title=Pitchfork media review of Ethiopia's Dub Collosus |publisher=Pitchfork.com |date=2009-01-15 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robin Denselow |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/21/dub-colossus-town-called-addis |title=The Guardian's review of Dub Collosus |publisher=Guardian |date=2008-11-21 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mali, Askia Modibo fuses reggae with [[Malian music]]. In [[Malawi]], [[Black Missionaries]] produced nine albums. In [[Ivory Coast]] a country where reggae music is extremely popular, [[Tiken Jah Fakoly]] fuses reggae with traditional music. [[Alpha Blondy]] from Ivory Coast sings reggae with religious lyrics. In [[Sudan]], beats, drums and bass guitar from reggae music has been adopted into their music as reggae is a very popular among the generations from young to old, some spiritual (religious) groups grow their dreadlocks and have some reggae beats in their chants.

===Asia and the Pacific===
In the Philippines, several bands and sound systems play reggae and dancehall music. Their music is called [[Pinoy reggae]]. [[Japanese reggae]] emerged in the early 1980s. Reggae is becoming more prevalent in Thailand as well. Reggae music is quite popular in [[Sri Lanka]]. Aside from the reggae music and Rastafari influences seen ever more on Thailand's islands and beaches, a true reggae sub-culture is taking root in Thailand's cities and towns. Many Thai artists, such as Job 2 Do, keep the tradition of reggae music and ideals alive in Thailand. By the end of the 1980s, the local music scene in Hawaii was dominated by [[Jawaiian]] music, a local form of reggae.

Famous Indian singer [[Kailash Kher]] and music producer [[Clinton Cerejo]] created ''Kalapi'', a rare fusion piece of Reggae and Indian music for [[Coke Studio India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cokestudioindia.mobi/season3/e03-s03.html?WT.cl=1&amp;WT.mn=Kalapi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131209205531/http://cokestudioindia.mobi/season3/e03-s03.html?WT.cl=1&amp;WT.mn=Kalapi |archivedate=2013-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other than this high-profile piece, Reggae is confined to a small, emerging scene in India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121228053351/http://www.reggae-vibes.com/concert/reggaeindia/reggaeindia.htm] &lt;/ref&gt; [[Thaikkudam Bridge]], a neo-Indian band based in Kerala, India is known for inducing Reggae into Indian regional blues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bridge|first1=Thaikkudam|title=Thaikkudam Bridge, reggae|url=http://thaikkudambridge.com/|website=Thaikkudam!|publisher=Govind Menon, Siddhart Menon|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia and New Zealand===
[[Reggae in Australia]] originated in the 1980s. Desert Reggae is a developing contemporary style possibly originating in [[Central Australia]]. Lyrics are often sung in Australian Aboriginal languages.&lt;ref&gt;Wilurarra Creative 2010.[http://www.wilurarra.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=24 Wilurarra Creative Music Development] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011201334/http://www.wilurarra.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=24 |date=October 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, possibly the best known Australian reggae groups are [[Sticky Fingers (band)]], [[Blue King Brown]] and [[Astronomy Class]], who both use [[English language]] lyrics.

[[New Zealand reggae]] was heavily inspired by [[Bob Marley]]'s 1979 tour of the country, and early reggae groups such as [[Herbs (band)|Herbs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vidarasta.com/frases-de-bob-marley/ Bob Marley Quotes] - The online biography&lt;/ref&gt; The genre has seen many bands like [[Fat Freddy's Drop]], [[Salmonella Dub]], [[The Black Seeds]] and [[Katchafire]] emerging in more recent times, often involving fusion with electronica.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, M.

'''''Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought''''' is a 2001 book by [[Cognitive anthropology|cognitive anthropologist]] [[Pascal Boyer]], in which the author discusses the [[evolutionary psychology of religion]] and [[evolutionary origin of religions]].

==Synopsis==
Boyer describes the genesis of religious concepts as a phenomenon of the mind's [[cognitive]] [[inference]] systems, comparable to [[pareidolia]] and [[perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena]] resulting from [[face perception]] processes within the [[human brain]]. Boyer supports this naturalistic origin of religion with evidence from many specialized disciplines including [[biological anthropology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[cognitive science]], [[linguistics]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[information processing]].

''Religion Explained'' frames religious practices and beliefs in terms of recent [[cognitive neuroscience]] research in the [[modularity of mind]]. This theory involves cognitive "modules" ("devices" or "subroutines") underlying inference systems and intuitions. For instance, Boyer suggests culturally-widespread beliefs in "supernatural agents" (e.g., gods, ancestors, spirits, and witches) result from [[agent detection]]: the intuitive modular process of assuming intervention by conscious agents, regardless of whether they are present. "When we see branches moving in a tree or when we hear an unexpected sound behind us, we immediately infer that some agent is the cause of this salient event. We can do that without any specific description of what the agent actually is."&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 2001:144,&lt;/ref&gt; Boyer cites [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]]'s classic [[Zande people|Zande]] story about a termite-infested roof collapsing.
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the anthropologist, the house caved in because of the termites. For the Zande, it was quite clear that witchcraft was involved. However, the Zande were also aware that the termites were the proximate cause of the incident. But what they wanted to know was why it happened at that particular time, when particular people were gathered in the house.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, 2001:196, cf. 2001:12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within Boyer's hypothesis, religion is a "parasite" (or "[[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]") offshoot from cognitive modules, comparable to the way the [[Reading (process)|reading]] process is parasitic upon [[language module]]s.
&lt;blockquote&gt;As I have pointed out repeatedly the building of religious concepts requires mental systems and capacities that are there anyway, religious concepts or not. Religious morality uses moral intuitions, religious notions of supernatural agents recruit our intuitions about agency in general, and so on. This is why I said that religious concepts are parasitic upon other mental capacities. Our capacities to play music, paint pictures or even make sense of printed ink-patterns on a page are also parasitic in this sense. This means that we can explain how people play music, paint pictures and learn to read by examining how mental capacities are recruited by these activities. The same goes for religion. Because the concepts require all sorts of specific human capacities (an intuitive psychology, a tendency to attend to some counterintuitive concepts, as well as various social mind adaptations), we can explain religion by describing how these various capacities get recruited, how they contribute to the features of religion that we find in so many different cultures. We do not need to assume that there is a special way of functioning that occurs only when processing religious thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, 2001:311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Boyer admits his explanation of religion 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is ''not'' a quick, shoot-from-the-hip solution of the kind that many people, either religious or not, seem to favor. There cannot be a magic bullet to explain the existence and common features of religion, as the phenomenon is the result of ''aggregate relevance'' – that is, of successful activation of a whole variety of mental systems.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 2001:298, italics in original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reviews and criticisms==
{{summarize section|date=January 2011}}
Critical reception of ''Religion Explained'' has been mixed.

[[Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi]], a professor of developmental psychology at the [[University of Haifa]], called the book "a milestone on the road to a new behavioral understanding of religion, basing itself on what has come to be known as cognitive anthropology, and pointedly ignoring much work done over the past one hundred years in the behavioral study of religion and in the psychological anthropology of religion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.human-nature.com/nibbs/02/boyer.html Book Review: Religion Explained] ''Human Nature Review'' 2002 Volume 2: 308–309 (22 July)&lt;/ref&gt; 
He continues: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The clearest virtue of this book is that of dealing with the real thing. Even today, most scholarly work on religion consists of apologetics in one form or another, and we are deluged by offers of grants to study "spirituality" or teach "religion and science". This all serves to make us forget that religion is a collection of fantasies about spirits, and Boyer indeed aims to teach us about the world of the spirits in the grand tradition of the Enlightenment. Any general introduction to the world of the spirits must be ambitious because it hasn't been done and also because it has been done intuitively by all of us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Klinghoffer]], a journalist and [[intelligent design]] proponent, wrote in the ''[[National Review]]'' that "Boyer's talk of 'religion is suspiciously generic" and describes his work as "professorial noodlings" that attempt to raise the question whether "all religions are somehow the same". He further claims that "debunkers like Boyer ... have their own unconscious motivations (to undermine religious faith, after all, is to set oneself free of its many inconvenient strictures)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080421220616/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_19_53/ai_78692094/pg_2 Faith no more—Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought—Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]], founder of [[The Skeptics Society]], described Boyer's book as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;a penetratingly insightful scientific analysis of religion because as an anthropologist he understands that any explanation must take into account the rich diversity of religious practices and beliefs around the world, and as a scientist he knows that any explanatory model must account for this diversity. Boyer is at his ethnographic best in describing the countless peculiar religious rituals he and his anthropological brethren have recorded, and especially in identifying the shortcomings of virtually every explanation for religion ever offered. … As a consequence, however, Boyer himself fails to provide a satisfactory explanation because he knows that religion is not a single entity resulting from a single cause.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael. 2001. ''How We Believe: Science, Skepticism, and the Search for God'', 2nd ed., Macmillan, p 256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Brigitte Schön, a theology professor at the [[University of Bonn]], wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Apart from being fascinating to read and containing many more highly original ideas than could be mentioned here, ''Religion explained'' is an important book for a number of reasons. First of all, Boyer is able to present a very dense network of theories which not only explains many religious phenomena but also sets them in relation to each other. The integration of cognitive science research leads to a very realistic model of how religious concepts are processed and communicated, something which has been conspicuously absent from most theories of religion so far. Boyer's account of the natural basis of religion explains very well the persistence and re-emergence of religion even in a secularized environment, as well as the tensions between official and folk religion.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte Schön. [http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb03/ivk/mjr/pdfs/2002/reviews/rev_schoen_2002.pdf "''Religion Explained: The evolutionary origins of religious thought''"], ''Marburg Journal of Religion'' 2002 7.1:1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Garry Runciman, 3rd Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Garry Runciman]], sociologist at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], asked "Are we hardwired for God?"
&lt;blockquote&gt;The diverse beliefs which Boyer cites extend from Apollo and Athena, to shamanism among the Panamanian Cuna, to aliens from remote galaxies allegedly landing in New Mexico. But his central agenda is the particular set of unobservable causal agencies cited in his subtitle, and his primary concern is with the question of how we are to account for beliefs that involve the attribution of conscious agency to beings other than humans and animals of the normal and familiar kind. Such beliefs are, as Boyer says, remarkably widespread, and for all their variant forms the variation is neither limitless nor random. His answer falls into two parts: first, these beliefs have in common a counterintuitive attribution of a certain range of properties to certain kinds of quasihuman being; second, the explanation of their diffusion and persistence is to be sought not in the extensive anthropological literature about the origins and functions of religion, but in recent advances in developmental, cognitive and evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Runciman. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/feb/07/londonreviewofbooks/print Are we hardwired for God?], ''London Review of Books'', July 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author and economist [[Zachary Karabell]] found stylistic faults. "Boyer's use of cognitive psychology, anthropology and other disciplines does generate a new template for examining old questions. But his method, however compelling, does not save the book from its considerable flaws. To begin with, the writing is frequently impenetrable." He concludes, "Of course, Boyer may be right. Human existence may simply be a story of living, breathing, eating and dying. But by not grappling with the possibility that a nonmaterial realm exists, Boyer has written a book about religion that is occasionally illuminating and utterly unconvincing."&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Karabell. [http://www.rivertwice.com/articles/pdfs/A_True_Believer_%20in_Science_Offers_a_Lopsided_Look_LAT.pdf A True Believer in Science Offers a Lopsided Look at Faith; ''RELIGION EXPLAINED: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought'', By Pascal Boyer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191026/http://www.rivertwice.com/articles/pdfs/A_True_Believer_%20in_Science_Offers_a_Lopsided_Look_LAT.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }}, ''Los Angeles Times'' June 16, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[comparative religion]] author [[Karen Armstrong]] reviewed Boyer's thesis.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion, he argues, is nothing more or less than a by-product of the human mind. It is a side effect of having a particular kind of brain. By far the most fascinating part of this highly accessible and informative book is Boyer's description of the way our minds work. We have an inbuilt set of ontological expectations and a tendency to dwell on intuitions which violate these, such as mountains that float or companions whom we do not see. From the dawn of modern consciousness, men and women have focused on certain imaginary personalities that transcend the norm, convinced that they can help them in strategic ways. These supernatural agents link with other mental systems, such as our moral intuitions and social categories, for which we can find no conceptual justification.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Armstrong, [http://www.asa3.org/archive/asa/200109/0070.html ''Religion Explained'' by Pascal Boyer], ''The Times'', August 29, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Habgood, Baron Habgood|John Habgood]], formerly [[Archbishop of York]], wrote.
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a bold and far-reaching book. What its author lacks in modesty, he makes up for in cogency of argument and elegance of style. His "explanation" of religion is lucid, entertaining, full of valuable insights and almost, but not quite, convincing. The usual explanations of religion—as an attempt to explain what is otherwise puzzling, as a provider of comfort, as a good thing for society or as an escape from reason—are quickly dismissed. Pascal Boyer seeks to demonstrate that its origins and motivations are more deep seated in our mental structures than any of these, which is why religion is so universal, so powerful and so unlikely to disappear even though, as he also claims, it is in the end only a mental phenomenon. Recent experience of the dreadful consequences of religious fanaticism gives his analysis a frightening contemporary relevance, not least because of the minor role within religion that he assigns to rationality.&lt;ref&gt;John Habgood, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=166258&amp;sectioncode=40 "Parasite of airy nothings?"], ''Times Higher Education'', 14 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''respective case''' (also called the '''dedative''' or '''relative''') is a [[grammatical case]] invented by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in his [[constructed language]] [[Quenya]] (the [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|elven language]] of the book ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''). It is not clear if this case is used with [[preposition]]s, [[transitive verb|transitive]] or [[intransitive verb]]s, or has a more general use. Based on a few examples, one linguist has deduced the possibility that it is used as a kind of [[locative]] (e.g.: ''i coa i taures / i coa i tauressë'' the house in the forest).&lt;ref name="hf7"&gt;Helge Fauskanger, "[http://ardalambion.immaginario.net/ardalambion/quenya.htm#Heading7 'Quenya: L’antica lingua]'', “I sostantivi”, Gianluca Comastri, Italian trans., Ardalambion. Accessed 16 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible use is to translate expressions with the preposition “about.” For example, in translating “He told me about the invasion,” the Quenya word for “invasion” might appear in the respective/dedative. The seeming absence of any other case being used to translate this preposition lends support to this conjecture. In the constructed language [[Ithkuil]] the case corresponding to the preposition about is called '''Referential case'''&lt;ref name="Ithkuil-cases"&gt;[http://ithkuil.net/04_case.html A Grammar of Ithkuil Chapter 4: Case Morphology]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Strand i Valdemarernes Tid.png|thumb|Rungholt and Strand in the Middle Ages, on a map from 1850]]
[[Image:Funde Rungholt.JPG|thumb|Finds from the Wadden Sea, possibly from Rungholt]]

'''Rungholt''' was a settlement in [[Nordfriesland]], in what was then the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Duchy of Schleswig]]. The area is today located in [[Germany]]. Rungholt reportedly sank beneath the waves of the [[North Sea]] when a [[Storm tides of the North Sea|storm tide]] (known as the second ''[[Grote Mandrenke]]'') hit the coast on 15 or 16 January 1362.

==Location==
The exact location of Rungholt remains unclear. It is likely that Rungholt was situated on the island of [[Strand (island)|Strand]], which was rent asunder by another storm tide in 1634, and of which the islets of [[Pellworm]], [[Nordstrand, Germany|Nordstrand]] and [[Nordstrandischmoor]] are the only remaining fragments.

One possible location is west of the Hallig [[Südfall]], where in 1921 significant ruins were discovered: wells, trenches and part of a tidal lock. Another theory places Rungholt to the north of the Hallig Südfall.&lt;ref name="NDR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndr.de/kultur/geschichte/chronologie/Rungholt-Atlantis-der-Nordsee,rungholt101.html|title=Rungholt – "Atlantis der Nordsee" (German)|publisher=Norddeutscher Rundfunk| date= 13 July 2012 |first=Levke|last=Heed|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Focus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/wissen/mensch/archaeologie/tid-26901/versunkene-staedte-2-rungholt-das-deutsche-atlantis_aid_798853.html|title=Rungholt – das deutsche Atlantis (German)|publisher=Focus Online| date= 15 August 2012 |first=Christina|last=Steinlein|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shz.de/lokales/husumer-nachrichten/rungholt-auf-den-spuren-einer-versunkenen-welt-id7438356.html|title=Rungholt – auf den Spuren einer versunkenen Welt (German)|publisher=Husumer Nachrichten| date= 22 August 2014 |first=|last=|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Today it is widely accepted that Rungholt did in fact exist and was not just a local legend. Documents support this, although they mostly date from much later times (16th century). Archaeologists think Rungholt was an important town and port. It might have contained up to 500 houses, with about 3,000 people. Findings indicate trade in agricultural products and possibly [[amber]]. Supposed relics of the town have been found in the [[Wadden Sea]], but shifting sediments make it hard to preserve them.&lt;ref name="NDR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Focus"/&gt;

There definitely was a great storm known as the ''[[Grote Mandrenke]]'', and sometimes also named after the saint [[Pope Marcellus I|Marcellus]], on 15 or 16 January 1362.&lt;ref name="NDR"/&gt; Estimates put the number of deaths at around 10,000. Possibly 30 settlements were destroyed, and the coastline shifted east, leaving formerly inhabited land in the tidal Wadden Sea.&lt;ref name="Focus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HN"/&gt;

==Legends and later reception==
Sometimes referred to as the "Atlantis of the North Sea", the Rungholt of legend was a large, rich town and the catastrophe supposedly a divine punishment for the sins of its inhabitants.&lt;ref name="NDR"/&gt;

Impressed by the fate of the town, the relics, and not least the legends' excessive descriptions, the German poet [[Detlev von Liliencron]] wrote a popular poem in 1882 called "''Trutz, Blanke Hans''" about this lost town which starts with the words: ''Heut bin ich über Rungholt gefahren, die Stadt ging unter vor sechshundert Jahren.'' ("Today I traveled over Rungholt; the town sank 600 years ago.").&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Trutz,_Blanke_Hans Trutz, Blanke Hans (Wikisource)]&lt;/ref&gt;

German singer [[Achim Reichel]] put [[Detlev von Liliencron|Liliencron's]] poem to music on his 1977 album "Regenballade".

German metal band [[Santiano_(band)|Santiano]] released a song called Rungholt in their 2015 CD "Von Liebe, Tod und Freiheit". It also includes verses from von Liliencron's poem.

[[Theodor Storm]] also mentions Rungholt in his [[novella]] ''Eine Halligfahrt''.&lt;ref name="NDR"/&gt;

[[Christian Kracht]] mentions Rungholt in his [[novella]] ''Faserland''.&lt;ref name="NDR"/&gt;

Local myth has it that one can still hear the church bells of Rungholt ringing under the water when sailing through the area on a calm night.&lt;ref name="NDR"/&gt;

'''The Scottish royal tapestry collection''' was a group of [[tapestry]] hangings assembled to decorate the palaces of sixteenth-century kings and queens of [[Scotland]].
==Tapestry at the Royal Court of Scotland==
[[File:WLA metmuseum 1495 Unicorn defend.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Scene from [[The Hunt of the Unicorn]] Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York]]
Like other European monarchs, the kings and queens of Scotland sought to impress their subjects and diplomatic visitors in costly surroundings. At [[Fontainebleau]] in 1540, the [[Francis I of France|King of France]] himself personally helped the English ambassador onto a bench so he could examine and admire the 'antique borders' of the tapestry in his bedchamber, and this was seen as a sign of special favour.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters &amp; Papers, Foreign and Domestic of Henry VIII'', vol. 16, no. 276, 17 November 1540.&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland, [[James V of Scotland|James V's]] tapestries were listed in two inventories, along with the crown jewels and fine clothes. These tapestries were used to hang the best chambers and halls in the palaces, and were transported with the monarch between residences and lined, fixed and hung by specialists on the court pay-roll. The rooms were decorated with a painted frieze at the top of the wall and plain beneath where the tapestries hung. [[Henry VIII of England]] had nearly 2000 tapestries and James V had 200.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Andrea, ''Princelie Majestie'', John Donald (2005), 79–80 citing Simon Thurley, ''The Royal Palaces of Tudor England'', 222-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven pieces of royal tapestry were destroyed in the explosion at [[Kirk o' Field]] in February 1567 that killed the King Consort of Scotland, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]].&lt;ref&gt;''Robertson, Joseph, ed., ''Inventaires de la Royne Descosse'', (1863), 51&lt;/ref&gt; None of the original Scottish tapestries are known to exist now, but the names of many of them were recorded, and the subjects are the same as those listed in other royal collections,&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Iain, The 'Battle of Pavia' and the Tapestry of Don Carlos, ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 144, no. 1191, June (2002), 345–351.&lt;/ref&gt; and some examples survive in museums around the world. Some of the tapestries showed Biblical themes, or subjects with medieval roots, but most were stories from classical antiquity, reflecting renaissance taste, and some were scenes from the hunting field.

==The reception of Margaret Tudor at Holyroodhouse==
In preparation for the arrival of his bride [[Margaret Tudor]] at [[Holyroodhouse]] on 8 August 1503, [[James IV of Scotland]] bought new tapestries. A group was bought from a merchant called James Homyll, who imported textiles from Flanders, which cost £160 Scots. These were a piece with the subject of ''Hercules'', two pieces of ''[[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]]'' sewn together, a ''Susanna'' bed cover, a ''Solomon'', and a ''Marcus Coriolanus''. The total measurement which, combined with quality, dictated the price, was 209 square ells. The tapestries were lined with canvas.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 2 (1900), 214.&lt;/ref&gt; A set of six verdure tapestries were bought for hanging in the gallery and on the stairs, each costing £3. Five other smaller verdures of various sizes cost £11-4s. Ten fine verdures were bought from John Stewart; three with 'beasts' cost £4-10s each, seven with no beasts cost £4 each. (The 'beasts' may have been unicorns) Four other verdures bought for beds were in quality, 'nocht sa gude,' and cost only 40 shillings each.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 2 (1900), 216, 217.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Before Margaret left England, the tapestry agent of [[Henry VII of England]], Cornelis van der Strete had been paid £7-8s (English money) for making or supplying 74 Flemish ells of tapestry for the Scottish Consort Queen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cu31924091754410 Bain, Joseph, ed., ''Calendar of Documents relating to Scotland'', 1357–1509, vol. 4, HM Register House, Edinburgh (1888), 441, Particular account of Robert Lytton, pp. 319–441]&lt;/ref&gt; The historian and curator Thomas P. Campbell suggests these may have been simple armorial tapestries or borders to be attached to figural tapestries purchased elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Thomas P., ''Henry VIII and the Art of Majesty'', (2007), 91–92, citing a corresponding account, MS PRO TNA E101/415/7, fol. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The English [[Somerset Herald]], John Young, described some of the tapestry at Holyroodhouse on the two days of celebration. Young noted the hangings in the two outer rooms of the King and Queen's suites where meals were served.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, John G., ''Scottish Royal Palaces'', Tuckwell (1999), 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen's hall was hung with the ''History of Hercules'', and her great chamber with the ''History of Troy Town''. The King's hall was hung with the ''History of Old Troy'', and his great chamber with ''Hercules'' and other stories.&lt;ref&gt;Leland, John ed., ''Collectanea'', vol. 3 (1770), 295–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly some of these tapestries were brought to Scotland by Margaret, perhaps with new borders including Tudor heraldry supplied by Cornelis van der Strete.

==Tapestry inventories==
Two inventories of 1539 and 1543 list the tapestries of James V.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, John G., ''Wardrobe Inventories'', Historic Scotland (2008), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these had belonged to James IV, though [[Gavin Douglas]] said that [[John Stewart, Duke of Albany|Regent Albany]] had cut up royal crimson and purple hangings to make clothes for his servants and pages,&lt;ref&gt;Paterson, W., ed., ''The Poetical Works of Gavin Douglas'', vol. 1 (1874), cviii.&lt;/ref&gt; but many were bought by James V, or were presents from Francis I. An inventory of September 1561 lists those in Scotland belonging to [[Mary of Guise]], and another compiled on 25 November lists [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]' collection. These lists have notes describing the later locations of the tapestries. Mary Queen of Scots added to the royal collection by confiscating 45 tapestries belonging to the [[George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly|Earl of Huntly]] at [[Huntly Castle]] in October 1562. These included one set of large leaf verdures and other set with leaves and birds. Five of the eleven tapestries destroyed at Kirk o'Field were from Huntly, the other were from a suite depicting a "Rabbit Hunt."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Joseph, ''Inventaires'', (1863), 51: Thomson (1815), p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[battle of Langside]] in May 1568, the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Regent Moray]] took back from [[Hamilton Palace]] rich silk tapestry and beds that had belonging to James V.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Domestic'', vol.8 (1871), nos. 2230,2232&lt;/ref&gt; An inventory of 1578 lists tapestries stored in [[Edinburgh Castle]] and hanging at [[Stirling Castle]] where James VI was resident. Tapestries at Stirling included four pieces of the "Hunts of the Unicorn".&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1815), 212-3, a second original copy of the 1578 inventory in British Library MS. Harley 4637 has addition notation, including the letter 'S' to indicate items at Stirling.&lt;/ref&gt; There may have been royal tapestries elsewhere in Scotland, but the omissions of items and suites listed in the earlier James V inventories raises the possibility that Regent Moray sold tapestries abroad in 1568 along with Mary's pearls, selected royal jewels and a so-called unicorn horn.&lt;ref&gt;Labanoff, A., ''Lettres de Marie Stuart'', vol. 7 (Dolman, London, 1852), 129–134, Bochetel to Charles IX and Catherine de Medici, reports jewel sale, 2–8 May 1568: Nicolas Elphinstone was the agent for jewel sales.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary, now a prisoner in England, complained in August 1570 that Scottish ships had brought items of her 'apparel, costly hangings, and jewels' to Hull and other English ports for sale.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol.3 (1902), p.289 no.393&lt;/ref&gt;

When Mary was moved to [[Tutbury Castle]] in February 1569, three suites of tapestries and carpets were delivered from the Removing Wardrobe at the [[Tower of London]] to furnish her rooms. These included six pieces of the ''Passion'', six pieces of the ''History of Ladies'', and seven pieces of ''Hercules''; the latter two subjects are found in the earlier Scottish inventories.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 2 (1900), 606.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Sheffield Manor]] in February 1577 she had her own tapestries of ''Aeneas'' and ''Meleager''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Labanoff, ''Lettres de Marie Stuart'', vol.4 (London , 1852), 360; vol.7, 273&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1585, when Mary was again being moved to Tutbury, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] recalled that Regent Moray had sent plate, hangings and other items to Mary while she was in the custody of the [[Earl of Shrewsbury]]. The Earl wrote (to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]]) that this was not the case and Elizabeth was mistaken; 'to my knowledge since her commynge she never received any stuff or other things from him.'&lt;ref&gt;G. Dynfnallt Owen, ed., ''HMC 58, Manuscripts Marquess of Bath'', vol. 5 (London, HMSO, 1980), pp.53–4, 30 January 1584/5.&lt;/ref&gt; At Fotheringhay in 1587 she had six pieces of ''Meleager'' and six of the ''Battle of Ravenna'' which she wished to be sold to pay for her servants' journeys home.&lt;ref&gt;A. Labanoff, ''Lettres de Marie Stuart'', vol. 7 (London, 1852), 273&lt;/ref&gt;

An inventory of [[Stirling Castle]] made in 1584 records a set of five tapestries hanging in the king's audience chamber, and seven in the bedchamber of the Palace.&lt;ref&gt;HMC, ''9th report &amp; appendix, part 2, Lord Elphinstone'', (1884), 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the tapestries were at [[Dunfermline Palace]] in 1616, where [[Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline]], had looked after the infant [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]].&lt;ref&gt;''Register of the Privy Council of Scotland'', vol. 10 (1891), 521.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the remaining contents of the Royal Wardrobe at Holyroodhouse in 1617, three pieces of green velvet embroidered with gold holly leaves and the [[Duc de Longueville|Longueville]] arms, which had belonged to Mary of Guise (Duchess of Longueville by her first marriage), were sent for repair.&lt;ref&gt;''Register of the Privy Council of Scotland'', vol. xi, (1894), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1635, Charles I wrote to [[John Stewart, 1st Earl of Traquair]], [[Lord High Treasurer of Scotland|Treasurer of Scotland]], insisting on the payment of the wardrobe servants, so that hangings, cloths-of-estate, and beds could be aired.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Manuscript Commission, ''9th Report &amp; Appendix, Traquair House'', (1884), 246b.&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining tapestries at Holyrood would have been seized by [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] troops in 1650. In April 1656, soldiers retrieved and sent to Whitehall four pieces of the ''Labours of Hercules'', perhaps the latest mention of tapestry from the Scottish royal collection.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, W.G., ''A History of Tapestry'', Hodder &amp; Stoughton (1930), 359–370, citing ''CSP Domestic'', 1655–1656, 23, 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bought in Paris===
The six pieces of the ''Triumphant Dames'' or ''City of Dames'' were bought in Paris in 1537 or 1538 for 883 francs 10 sous during James V's trip to marry [[Madeleine of Valois]]. The pieces varied slightly in size with a total area of 147 square [[ell]]s, each square ell costed at six francs. These were sent to [[Rouen]] by boat and then to [[Le Havre|Newhaven]] in France for shipping, along with another set called the ''Old and New Stories''. A set with a similar name, the ''New Law and the Old'', was listed among [[Catherine of Aragon]]'s effects in February 1536.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters &amp; Papers Henry VIII'', vol. 8, (1885), no. 209, she also had a ''Jason'' and a ''Hercules''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish suite was probably the ten-piece ''Old Testament'' listed in the inventory of 1539. Only one piece was noted in 1542, and none was heard of again in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', ''TA'', vol. 7, (1907), 28, 39, 43–4: [[Thomas Thomson (advocate)|Thomson, Thomas]], ''A Collection of Royal Inventories'', Bannatyne Club, (1815), 49, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; James V's servant George Steill was sent to Flanders from Paris on 3 February 1537 to acquire more tapestries. At the same time James V hired a new French tapestry-man, William, and gave him 20 crowns to bring his wife and children to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 7 (1907), 17, 18, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Years later, when Mary, Queen of Scots, was a prisoner at [[Tutbury Castle]], six pieces of series called the ''History of Ladies'' were sent from the Tower of London.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 2, 606.&lt;/ref&gt; This was probably one of three sets of the ''City of Ladies'' that had belonged to Henry VIII, listed in the [[Inventory of Henry VIII of England|inventory of 1547]], which were identical in size piece by piece to the Scottish tapestries. These had decorated the childhood homes of [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]] and [[Edward VI of England|Prince Edward]]&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, David, ''Inventory of Henry VIII'', vol.1, Harvey Millar (1998), nos. 9021, 14033, 15272. (sq-yard:sq-Fr. ell ratio 1:1.6, sq Fr. ell:sq Fl. ell ratio 1:3.)&lt;/ref&gt; The subject derives from [[Christine de Pizan]]'s ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]].''&lt;ref&gt;Hindman, Sandra L., ''Feminist Studies'', vol. 10, no. 3, Autumn (1984), 459–483.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sets of the subject belonged to [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret of Austria]], [[Mary of Austria, Queen of Hungary|Mary of Hungary]], [[Anne of Brittany]] and Francis I.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Susan Groag, ''The Lost Tapestries of the City of Ladies'', (2004), 167–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other tapestry bought in Paris and packed for shipping to Rouen was the ''Creation of World'', of which nine pieces were at [[Holyroodhouse]] in 1561, and in Edinburgh Castle in 1578.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 7 (1907), 44: Thomson (1815), 126, no. 19, 211: ''Inventaires de la Royne d'Ecosse'', 20, no. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1616, Alexander Seton had some 'auld and worne' pieces described as the ''Storie of Mankynd'' at Dunfermline Palace.&lt;ref&gt;''Register of the Privy Council of Scotland'', vol. 10, (1891), 521.&lt;/ref&gt; The set could possibly have been ''The World'' series, depicting various moral allegories and including a globe.&lt;ref&gt;Adelson, Candace J., ''European Tapestry in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts'', (1994), 92–104.&lt;/ref&gt; A list of wedding gifts from Francis I adds four suites of rich arras hangings, and eight suites of coarser arras, all 'ret verey good.'&lt;ref&gt;[[William Guthrie (historian)|Guthrie, William]], ''History of Scotland'', vol. 5, London (1767), 166 citing Balfour's annals: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q10LAAAAYAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Historical works of Sir James Balfour'', vol. 1, Edinburgh (1824), 266–267]&lt;/ref&gt; These gifts would have been included among the tapestries named in the Scottish inventories mentioned below. In October 1546, an [[Antwerp]] merchant, Eustatius de Coqueil, wrote to Mary of Guise offering her histories and other tapestries, but it seems unlikely that any were bought during this brief period of peace in the [[war of the Rough Wooing]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Marguerite, ''Balcarres Papers'', vol. 1, SHS (1923), 148–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tobias and the Angel and the Tint Barne===
The ''Tint Barne'', the ''History of the Lost Child'', might appear to be the same subject as the ''History of Tobias''. However the five-piece ''Tobias'' was listed in 1539 and also in 1542, along with the seven-piece ''Tint Barne''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1815), 49, 103&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of the ''tinte barne'' was probably the ''[[Prodigal Son]]'', a subject listed many times in the inventory of Henry VIII,&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, David, ''The Inventory of Henry VIII'', vol. 1, Harvey Millar (1998), nos. 9283, 9288, 9737, 11996-9, 1258–71, 13342, 14049.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cardinal Wolsey]] had seven pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Verdier, Philippe, 'The Tapestry of the Prodigal Son', ''The Journal of The Walters Art Gallery'', vol. 18 (1955), 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chamber of the Antique history===
These were delivered by a William Schaw in 1539, costing 2466 crowns of the sun (French – ''ecu d'or au soleil''). It was a group of five (or six) sets of seven pieces, and included seven ''Sundry pieces histories of Chambers'' in fine stuff listed in 1539. Additions for this ''Chamber of Antique History'' were bought by a servant of John Moffet, conservator of Flanders in April 1541.&lt;ref&gt;''TA'', vii, (1907), 253, 257, 278, 290, 471: Thomson (1815), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The word 'chamber' referred to the suite of tapestry rather than any actual room in the palaces. Subjects supplied by William Schaw listed in 1539 include; seven pieces of ''Poesy''; seven pieces of ''Jason and Golden Fleece''; and seven pieces of ''[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]'', ''[[Athena|Pallas]]'', ''[[Hercules]]'', ''[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]'', ''[[Bacchus]]'', and ''[[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]'' (''Mother of the Earth''), with the Biblical ''History of Solomon''. Only six pieces of the ''Jason'' were listed in 1542.  Four pieces of the ''Solomon'' were listed in September 1561, and noted circa 1568 to be at Stirling. The others are not heard of again. The ''Little Solomon'' was also noted in September 1561, another set, or perhaps three of the seven scenes pieces bought by William Schaw.

The seven-piece ''History of Perseus'' was presumably of this group, though not linked in the inventories of 1539 and 1540 to William Schaw's purchase.  [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] had bought one piece of a ''History of Hercules'', and nine were listed in 1542. This was a suite separate to the ''Hercules'' in the ancient god series of the ''Chambers''.&lt;ref&gt;Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 2 , 214, June 1503 : Thomson (1815), 103.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Similarly a three piece ''History of Romulus'' was listed in 1542. The ''Old History of Troy'' of eight or nine pieces listed in 1539 and 1542 was perhaps a Stewart inheritance, old and already described as worn out, so distinguished from the ''Aeneas''. The family of Mary of Guise's first husband, Louis II d'Orléans, [[Duc de Longueville]], had ''Troy'' tapestries at their [[Château de Châteaudun]] as early as 1468.&lt;ref&gt;McKendrick, Scot, The Great History of Troy, ''Journal of the Warburg &amp; Courtauld Institutes'', vol. 54, (1991), 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 13 pieces of the ''History of Aeneas'' were carried from Edinburgh Castle to [[St. Andrews]] in May 1539, and are listed in the inventory of 1539.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 7, 165: Thomson, (1815), 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight pieces described as the ''Sailing of Aeneas'' are listed in November 1561 at Holyroodhouse, with a note, presumably of c.1568, locating them at Stirling Castle.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, (1815), 143: ''Inventaires de la Royne d'Ecosse'', Bannatyne Club (1863), 39 (no. 87).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1578 there were eight ''Sailing'' pieces and four others at Edinburgh Castle.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, (1815), 211.&lt;/ref&gt; The extra tapestry may have been a piece from the ''Old History of Troy,'' or possibly the ''Sailing of Aeneas'' set, first listed in November 1561, was newly brought from France by Queen Mary and not part of James's ''Aeneas''. Alexander Seton had some of the ''Aeneas'' and ''Troy'' at Dunfermline among his 10 old pieces in 1616.&lt;ref&gt;''Register of the Privy Council of Scotland'', vol. 7, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; An area of the garden of Holyroodhouse was called the ''Sege of Troy'', and there may have been a connection, perhaps only that the tapestries were aired there.&lt;ref&gt;''Register of the Great Seal of Scotland,'' 1580–1593, (1888), 142, no. 456.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Meleager===
A separate subject from the ''Jason'', listed in 1539 as the ''History of Maliasor'', this six-piece tapestry of ''[[Meleager]]'' was at [[Fotheringhay Castle]] in 1587 as Mary's own possession. At Fotheringay, Mary, Queen of Scots, also had the six pieces of the ''History of Count Foix and the Battle of Ravenna'', from the Scottish collection,&lt;ref&gt;Bath, Michael, ''Emblems for a Queen'', Archetype (2008), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; but as this set was only previously listed in November 1561 it might not have belonged to her parents. An eighteenth-century engraving of Gaston de Foix was said to derive from a similar tapestry.[[File:Gaston de Foix (engraving).jpg|thumb|Gaston de Foix, from a tapestry]] [[Amias Paulet]] her gaoler spent £113-10s in English money on lining, packing, and hanging eight pieces of her tapestry during her move from [[Chartley Castle|Chartley]] to [[Fotheringhay Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts and Papers relating to Mary Queen of Scots'', Camden Society, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary wished the ''Meleager'' and ''Ravenna'' to be sold after her death, with cloths-of-estate, to fund the return journeys of her physician and Mr Melville.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1815), 49: Labanoff, A., ''Lettres de Marie-Stuart'', vol. 7, Dolman (1852), 236, 273–4.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Like the ''Meleager'', the biblical ''Roboam'' which appears in most inventories also dates from 1539.

===Triumph and Assault of a Town===
This may have been a copy of the famous tapestry commissioned by [[Francis I of France|François Ier]] from designs by [[Giulio Romano]], the ''Gestes of Scipion'', the story of [[Scipio Africanus]], which includes the scene ''Siege of Carthagena''. However, like the ''Battle of Ravenna'', the five pieces are first listed in November 1561 and so this too might not have belonged to James and Mary of Guise, unless they were among the unspecified tapestries bought by William Schaw in 1539.&lt;ref&gt;''Inventaires'', (1863), 39 no. 81: Thomson (1815), 144 no. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are other tapestries with the subject ''Siege of a Town'' in late medieval style which answer the description. Another possibility is that these were scenes of the ''Siege of Troy'', a subject found in Henry VIII's collection.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, David, The ''Inventory of Henry VIII'', (1998), Troy nos. 12621, 14034; Siege of Troy no. 13053.&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly, this tapestry was in mind when Mary of Guise, according to [[John Knox]], remarked that the aftermath of the failed assault on [[Siege of Leith|Leith]] of 7 May 1560 was the fairest tapestry she had ever seen.&lt;ref&gt;Knox, John, ''History of the Reformation'', Book 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unicorns, apes, beasts and others===
[[File:Replica Unicorn tapestry, Stirling Castle.JPG|thumb|Unicorn tapestry woven in 2010, in Mary of Guise's Audience Chamber at [[Stirling Castle]]]]
James V's other named tapestries included the six Great and eight Little ''[[Unicorn]]'' pieces. The ''Great Unicorn'' set has been identified as another version of the famous tapestries, the [[The Hunt of the Unicorn|Hunt of the Unicorn]], now in the [[The Cloisters|Cloisters]] Museum of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York. Faithful copies using the original technique are being made for display in the Palace of Stirling Castle. These unicorn tapestries had belonged to his father, James IV, but the subject was still popular in 1540, when Pierre de Clanquemeulle, companion tapestry maker, was hired by Léon Brocart, master weaver in Paris, to complete two pieces of an ''Histoire de la Chasse à la licorne''.&lt;ref&gt;Grodecki, Cathérine, ''Documents du Minutier Central des Notaires de Paris: Histoire de l'art au XVIe siècle, 1540–1600'', vol. 1, Archives Nationales, (1984), 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven pieces of the ''History of the Apis and uther Bestis'' were recorded in 1539. Six pieces of the History of Apes were recorded in 1561. In January 1563 three pieces of this tapestry with monkeys, the ''tapisserie des singes'', were given by Mary Queen of Scots to Pierre Marnard the court ''fruictier'', a kitchen officer who took part in masques.&lt;ref&gt;J. Robertson, ''Inventaires'', (1863), 137: T. Thomson, ''Collection of Inventories'', 50, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Listed in the September 1561 inventory, 10 pieces of ''History of Hunting and Hawking'' may have been a separate item originally belonging to James V, and perhaps distinct from the six-piece set of the ''Hunting of the Sanglier'' (Wild Boar), and seven-piece ''Coningars'' (the Rabbit Hunt), listed in later inventories. One scene from this ''Rabbit Hunt'', otherwise called the ''L’histoire des Chasseurs de Cogny'' in an inventory written in French, was said to have been lost at [[Linlithgow Palace|Linlithgow]] during the 1566 baptism of [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] at Stirling. However this loss had already been recorded in 1565, as having occurred at Linlithgow during the keepership of [[James Sandilands, 1st Lord Torphichen|James Sandilands]], Master of the [[Torphichen Preceptory|Preceptory of St John at Torphichen]], perhaps the one later said to have been cut by "Andro Cockburn fule." The other six pieces were destroyed at the Kirk o'Field explosion. Another tapestry of the "Rabbit Hunt" had been made into bed curtains.&lt;ref&gt;j. Robertson, ''Inventaires'', (1863), 51, 153, 178, 20 May 1567: Thomson (1815), 142, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Burrell Collection]] in Glasgow has an example of a tapestry of this subject, dated from c. 1475.&lt;ref&gt;''The Burrell Collection'', Collins, (1983), 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

James IV bought one scene of [[Gaius Marcius Coriolanus|''Marcus Coriolanus'']], which may be the ''Mathiolus'' tapestry mentioned in later inventories, and a ''Solomon'', which may be ''Judgement of Solomon'' noted in September 1561, of worsett with gold.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 2, 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, Susan Groag Bell wonders if this ''Mathiolus'' was the first scene of the ''City of Ladies'' suite bought in 1538, featuring the name of the author [[Mathieu of Boulogne|Matheolus]] as a protagonist illustrating the works of [[Christine de Pisan]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Susan Groag, ''The Lost Tapestries of the City of Ladies'', University of California, (2004), 21–22, 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of the ''History of the Shepherds'' of seven pieces and the ''History of Calveris and Moris'' of four pieces noted in 1561 may be obscure. The eight-piece ''Triumph of Verity'' also noted in November 1561 may have come to Scotland with Mary in 1561, unless perhaps this was yet another name for the ''City of Dames.''

===The tapestry men===
When James V moved around Scotland the ''tapissiers'' or 'tapestry men' packed up the tapestries and set them up at his destination, and carried out running repairs. George Steill bound up twelve scenes of the ''History of Aeneas'' with cords and carried them from Edinburgh to St Andrews in May 1539 for the marriage of Joanna Gresmore to the Laird of Creich.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer'', vol. 7, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight pieces of tapestry were specially repaired for the coronation of Mary of Guise in January 1540, and others were often relined with new canvas.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 7 (1907), 94, 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacques Habet, William Edbe and George Steill lined the rough or newly plastered walls of the castle at [[Crawfordjohn]] to save wear on tapestries in July 1541.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of Lord Treasurer of Scotland,'' vol. 7 (1907), 458.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this work, the men also made up and embroidered state beds with luxury imported silks and taffetas with hanks of gold thread, finished with [[passementerie]] and ostrich feather trimmings.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 7 (1907), 411–412.&lt;/ref&gt; Guillaume, hired in France in 1538, Habet, and the embroiderer Robinet, were doubtless Frenchmen, but William Edbe was Scottish.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Andrea, ''Princelie Majestie'', John Donald, (2005), 79: ''TA'', vol. 7, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Habet may have been the "Jacques Hebert" later hired by the Parisian master weaver Girard Laurens in 1564.&lt;ref&gt;Grodecki,Cathérine, ''Documents du Minutier Central des Notaires de Paris: Histoire de l'Art au XVIe siècle, 1540–1600'', vol. 1, Archives Nationales, (1985), 301 no.436&lt;/ref&gt;

There was extra work when the tapestry was taken out of the castles and used on other occasions. In May 1544, when an [[Burning of Edinburgh (1544)|English army burnt Edinburgh]], the tapestries were carried up the [[Royal Mile]] from Holyroodhouse to the Castle for safety and watched by Regent Arran's wardrobe servant Malcolm Gourlay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/accountslordhig00unkngoog ''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol.8, HM General Register House (1908)] lv–lix, pp.276, 289–291.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Regent Arran]] borrowed the royal tapestry for his daughter Barbara's wedding in 1549, and after it had been cleaned by six apprentices it was brought out for the visit of Mary of Guise's brother, the [[Claude, Duke of Aumale|Marquis de Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 7 (1907), 94, 294, 458.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1569, tapestry was hung in Glasgow for the French ambassador, in April 1572 the Deanery at [[Restalrig]] was hung with tapestry for the English ambassadors [[Thomas Randolph (diplomat)|Thomas Randolph]] and [[William Drury]], and in September 1572, William Murray, the [[Valet de chambre|varlet]] of [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]]'s bedchamber hung the tollbooth of Stirling with tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 12 (1970), 119, 282:  T. Thomson, ed., ''Diurnal of Occurrents'', (Edinburgh, 1833), 291&lt;/ref&gt; George Strathauchin, embroiderer, was James's "tapiser" with annual salary of £40 and lodging; on 7 October 1584, the [[Patrick Gray, 6th Lord Gray|Master of Gray]] was made Keeper of the Wardrobe, including the tapestry, with all officers of the household commanded to reverence, acknowledge and obey him.&lt;ref&gt;''Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland'', vol. 8 (1982), 132, no. 800; 436, no. 2486.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''South American Handbook''''' is a travel guide to [[South America]], published in the United Kingdom by [[Footprint Travel Guides|Footprint Books]]. It is the longest-running travel guide in the English language. In 2010 it was chosen as the Best South American Handbook by ''Sounds and Colours''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundsandcolours.com/the-best/the-best-books/the-best-south-american-travel-guidebooks/ The Best South American Travel Guidebooks]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The handbook was first published in 1921 as the ''Anglo-South American Handbook''. It was founded and compiled by [[William Henry Koebel]] (1872-1923),&lt;ref&gt;[https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL18500A/W._H._Koebel Open Library: W. H. Koebel]&lt;/ref&gt; a prolific author who had a particular interest in promoting trade with South America. It was compiled as a guide to South America, as well as Mexico and Cuba, for the business traveller, and published by the [[Federation of British Industry]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, ''Koebel, William Henry''&lt;/ref&gt;

Two editions later the book was 'privatised' and in 1924 it became the ''South American Handbook'', published by Trade and Travel Publications Ltd, a [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] subsidiary&lt;ref name=Nicol&gt;{{cite book |last=Nicol |first=Stuart |year=2001 |title=MacQueen's Legacy; A History of the Royal Mail Line |volume=One |place=Brimscombe Port and Charleston, SC |publisher=[[The History Press|Tempus Publishing]] |isbn=0-7524-2118-2 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporated in December 1922.&lt;ref name=coho&gt;[http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk Companies House Webcheck] Company number 186564&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, travel was by sea and the handbook gave all the details needed for the long voyage from Europe, including a full account of the journey from Liverpool up the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] to [[Manaus]], some 5,898 miles without changing cabin. It also imparted such invaluable etiquette advice as to 'pack a good saddle and a set of starched collars'.

From about the 1930s the Mendip Press of [[Bath, Somerset]] printed the book. Early in the 1970s Royal Mail Lines sold Trade and Travel Publications to the Mendip Press's parent company, Dawson and Goodall Ltd.&lt;ref name=Nicol/&gt; The handbook continued to be published annually and received updates from readers, including figures such as [[Paul Theroux]] and the novelist [[Graham Greene]], who addressed his updates to 'The publishers of the best travel guide in the world, Bath, England'.

Over the years the handbook expanded its coverage to include all the countries of South America, Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean. It continued to include data for businessmen, but by the 1970s was increasingly aimed at leisure travellers, particularly backpackers following the [[Gringo Trail]]. In 1989 the 65th edition was almost 1,400 pages long.

In 1990 the handbook was split. The ''Mexico &amp; Central America Handbook'' and the ''Caribbean Islands Handbook'' were published as separate volumes, and from then on the ''South American Handbook'' covered only South America.

Trade and Travel Publications changed its name to Footprint Handbooks Ltd in August 1996.&lt;ref name=coho/&gt;

A '''state of exception''' ({{lang-de|Ausnahmezustand}}) is a concept in the legal theory of [[Carl Schmitt]], similar to a [[state of emergency]], but based in the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]]'s ability to transcend the [[rule of law]] in the name of the public good. This concept is developed in [[Giorgio Agamben]]'s book ''State of Exception''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo3534874.html |title=State of Exception |publisher=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stunt performer''', often referred to as a '''stuntman''', '''stuntwoman''' or '''daredevil''', is a trained professional who performs [[stunts]], often as a career.

==Overview==
A stuntman typically performs stunts intended for use in a [[film|motion picture]] or dramatized [[television]]. Stunts seen in films and television include car crashes, falls from great height, drags (for example, behind a horse), and explosions.&lt;ref name=Freese/&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt;

There is an inherent risk in the performance of all stunt work. The most risk exists when performing stunts in front of a live audience. In filmed performances, visible safety mechanisms can be removed by editing. In live performances the audience can see more clearly if the performer is genuinely doing what they claim or appear to do. To reduce the risk of injury or death, most often stunts are choreographed or mechanically-rigged so that, while they look dangerous, safety mechanisms are built into the performance. Despite their well-choreographed appearance, stunts are still very dangerous and physically testing exercises.&lt;ref name=Freese/&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt;

From its inception as a professional skill in the early 1900s to the 1960s, stunts were most often performed by professionals who had trained in that discipline prior to entering the movie industry.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt; Current film and television stunt performers must be trained in a variety of disciplines including martial arts and [[stage combat]], and must be a certified trained member of a professional stunt performers organisation first, in order to obtain the necessary [[insurance]] to perform on stage or screen.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt; This allows them to better break down and plan an action sequence, physically prepare themselves, and incorporate both the safety and risk factors in their performances.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt; However, even when executed perfectly, there is still strain and performing stunts often results in unplanned injury to the body.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt;

Daredevils are distinct from stunt performers and [[stunt double]]s; their performance is of the stunt itself, without the context of a film or television show. Daredevils often perform for an audience. Live stunt performers include [[escape artist]]s, [[sword swallower]]s, glass walkers, [[fire eater]]s, [[trapeze artist]]s, and many other [[sideshow]] and [[circus]] arts. They also include motorcycle display teams and the once popular [[Wall of death (carnival sideshow)|Wall of Death]]. The [[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]] films and television series are well-known and prominent recorded examples of the act in modern cinematography.

Some people, such as [[Buster Keaton]], [[Harry Houdini]], [[Jackie Chan]], [[Akshay Kumar]], [[Pawan Kalyan]], [[Tony Jaa]], and [[Jayan]], act as both stunt performers and daredevils at various parts of their career.

==History==

===Cascadeur===
[[File:Action. Rodeo BAnQ P48S1P12760 detail.jpg|thumbnail|Circus performers doing an automobile stunt in [[Delorimier Stadium]], [[Montreal]], in 1946]]
The earliest stunt performers were travelling entertainers and [[circus]] performers, particularly trained [[gymnast]]s and [[acrobatics|acrobats]]. The origin of the original name, the French language word ''cascadeur'', may have been derived from the requirement to fall in a sequence of movements during a scene or stunt involving water (''Cascade'' is the French language term for [[waterfall]])&lt;ref name=Freese&gt;{{cite book|title=Hollywood Stunt Performers, 1910s-1970s: A Biographical Dictionary|author=Gene Scott Freese|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co Inc|date=30 April 2014|ISBN=978-0786476435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in the [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] circus use of the word ''Kaskadeur'', it meant performing a sequential series of daring leaps and jumps without injury to the performer. This acrobatic discipline required long training in the ring and perfect body control to present a sensational performance to the public.&lt;ref name=ActArtDe/&gt;

The word stunt was more formally adopted during the 19th century travelling [[vaudeville]] performances of the early [[Wild West Shows]], in North America and Europe. The first and prototypical wild west show was [[Buffalo Bill]]'s, formed in 1883 and lasting until 1913. The shows which involved simulated battles with the associated firing of both guns and arrows, were a romanticized version of the [[American Old West]].

===Stage combat===
{{main|Stage combat}}
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[stage combat]] scenes of swordplay in touring theatrical productions throughout Europe, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and North America were typically created by combining several widely known, generic routines known as "standard combats". During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[fencing (sport)|fencing]] masters in Europe began to research and experiment with [[historical fencing]] techniques, with weapons such as the [[two-handed sword]], [[rapier]], and [[smallsword]], and to instruct actors in their use.&lt;ref name=Wolf /&gt;

Notable among these revivalist instructors were [[George Dubois]], a fight director and martial artist from [[Paris]] who created performance fencing styles based on [[gladiator]]ial combat as well as Renaissance [[rapier and dagger]] fencing. [[Egerton Castle]] and Captain [[Alfred Hutton]] were part of a wider [[Victorian era]] group based in [[London]], involved in reviving [[historical fencing]] systems. Circa 1899–1902, Hutton taught stage fencing classes for actors via the [[Bartitsu]] Club, where he also served on the Board of Directors and learned the basics of [[jujutsu]] and the Vigny method of [[stick fighting]] from his fellow instructors.&lt;ref name=Wolf&gt;Wolf, Tony. (2009) ''A Terrific Combat!!! Theatrical Duels, Brawls and Battles, 1800-1920''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early cinema===
By the early 1900s, the motion picture industry was starting to fire-up on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], but had no need for professional stunt performers.&lt;ref name=Freese /&gt; First, motion pictures were so new that even if the producer had a budget for performers, there were more than enough applicants willing to do the scene for free. For instance, if you needed a shot of someone on a steel beam {{convert|1000|ft}} up on a New York skyscraper, then there was always some willing to do the scene for real, and often for free. Second, the [[Spanish–American War]] had just ended, and there were many physically fit and trained in the handling of firearms young men looking for some work. Thirdly, the former wild west was now not only tamed, but also starting to be fenced in, greatly reducing the need for and pay of the former [[cowboy]]s.&lt;ref name=Freese /&gt;&lt;ref name=TiHWestern /&gt;

The first picture which used a dedicated stunt performer is highly debated, but occurred somewhere between 1903 and 1910.&lt;ref name=Freese /&gt; The first possible appearance of a stunt-double was Frank Hanaway in ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', shot in 1903 in [[Milltown, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=LPFHM /&gt;&lt;ref name=TiHWestern /&gt; The first auditable paid stunt was in the 1908 film ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', with $5 paid by the director to the acrobat who had to jump upside down from a cliff into the sea.&lt;ref name=ActArtDe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actionartist.de/en/stunt.htm|title=The history of the Stuntman|author=Ilian Simeonow|publisher=ActionArtist.de|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional daredevil, [[Rodman Law]], was a trick parachutist known to thousands for climbing the side of buildings and parachuting out aeroplanes and off of tall [[base jumping|base]] objects like the Statue of Liberty. Some of his stunts were filmed by newsreel cameras and media still photographers. Law was brought into movies in 1912 to perform some of his stunts as the hero.

As the industry developed in the West Coast around [[Hollywood]], [[California]], the first accepted professional stuntmen were clowns and comedians like [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]] and the [[Keystone Kops]].&lt;ref name=SMAssoc /&gt; The reason for this was that staple diet of the early films was an almost continual roll call of pratfalls, high dives and comedy car wrecks – the basic ingredients of a circus clown's routine.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc /&gt; But much like their circus-based predecessors, these actors/stuntmen were not specifically trained to perform stunts, but instead learned through trial and error.&lt;ref name=Freese /&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM /&gt;

===Cowboy professionals===
From 1910 onwards, American audiences developed a taste for [[action movies]], which were replicated into successful serials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Summers|first1=Olivia|title=A Look at the History of Stunt Performers|url=https://www.oliviasummers.com/blog/2016/10/5/a-look-at-the-history-of-stunt-performers|website=Female Stunt &amp; Precision Car Driver|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mostly western-themed scripts required a lot of extras, such as for a galloping cavalry, a band of Indians or a fast riding sheriff’s posse; all of whom needed to proficiently ride, shoot and look right on camera.&lt;ref name=TiHWestern&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tripsintohistory.com/2012/08/18/movie-stuntmen-we-wouldnt-have-the-old-western-films-without-them/|title=Movie Stuntmen / We Wouldn’t Have the Old Western Films Without Them|publisher=tripsintohistory.com|date=August 18, 2012|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers also kept pushing the directors calling for riskier stunts using a recurring cast, necessitating the use of dedicated stunt doubles for most movie stars.&lt;ref name=Freese/&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt; The directors turned to the current rodeo stars for inspiration for their action scenes, and employed former cowboys as extras who not only brought with themselves the right look and style, but also rodeo techniques that included safe and replicable horse falls.&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt;

Early recruits included [[Tom Mix]], who after winning the 1909 National Riding and Rodeo Championship, worked for the [[Selig Polyscope Company]] in [[Edendale, Los Angeles, California|Edendale]]. Mix made his first appearance in ''The Cowboy Millionaire'' in October 1909, and then as himself in the short documentary film titled ''Ranch Life in the Great Southwest'' in which he displayed his skills as a cattle wrangler. Mix eventually performed in over 160 cowboy matinee movies during the 1920s, and is considered by many as the first matinee cowboy idol.&lt;ref name="TiHWestern" /&gt;

The recruitment venture was aided in 1911 by the collapse of the [[Miller Brothers 101 Ranch|Miller-Arlington]] rodeo show, that left many rodeo performers stranded in [[Venice, California]]. They including the young Rose August Wenger, who married and was later billed as [[Helen Gibson]], recognised as the first American professional stunt woman.&lt;ref&gt;Truitt, Evelyn Mack (1984). Who Was Who On Screen. New York: Bowker. {{ISBN|0-8352-1906-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas H. Ince]], who was producing for the [[New York Motion Picture Company]], hired the entire show's cast for the winter at $2,500 a week. The performers were paid $8 a week and boarded in Venice, where the horses were stabled. They then rode the {{convert|5|mi}} each day to work in [[Topanga Canyon]], where the films were being shot. In 1912, Helen made $15 a week for her first billed role as [[Ruth Roland]]'s sister in ''[[Ranch Girls on a Rampage]]''.&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/jgodsey/2223877544 Gibson, Helen. unpublished letter December 24, 1966]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After marrying [[Hoot Gibson|Edmund Richard "Hoot" Gibson]] in June 1913, the couple continued working rodeo's in the summer and as stunt doubles in the winter in California, most often for [[Kalem Company|Kalem Studios]] in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]].&lt;ref name="In Very"&gt;Gibson and Kornick, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1915 while on the Kalem payroll doubling for [[Helen Holmes]] in ''[[The Hazards of Helen]]'' [[adventure film]] [[Serial (film)|series]], Helen performed what is thought to be her most dangerous stunt: a leap from the roof of a station onto the top of a moving train in the ''A Girl’s Grit'' episode. The distance between station roof and train top was accurately measured, and she practiced the jump with the train standing still. In the actual shoot, with the trains accelerating velocity timed to the second, she leapt without hesitation and landed correctly, but with forward motion she rolled forward, saving herself from injury and improving the shot by catching hold of an air vent and dangling over the edge. She suffered only a few bruises.&lt;ref name="wise"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Wise|title=Stunting In the Cinema|date=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the out of work cowboys and out of season rodeo riders, and the directors/producers, figured out a system for the supply of extras. A [[speakeasy]] called ''The Watering Hole'' was located close to a Los Angeles located [[corral]] called the Sunset Corral.&lt;ref name=TiHWestern/&gt; Every morning, the cowboys would congregate at ''The Watering Hole'', where the directors would send over their assistants to hire for the following day. The cowboys would then dress in their normal riding clothes (unless told other wise, for which they were paid extra), and ride to the set, most of which were located to the north in the vicinity of the [[San Fernando Valley]].&lt;ref name=TiHWestern/&gt; These "riding extras" jobs paid $10 per day plus a box lunch, and most were only hired on a per day basis.&lt;ref name=TiHWestern/&gt; These early cowboy actors eventually gained the nickname ''The Gower Gulch Gang'', as many of the small studios cranking out westerns were located on Gower Avenue.&lt;ref name=TiHWestern/&gt;

Subsequently, a number of rodeo stars entered the movie industry on a full-time basis, with many "riding extras" eventually becoming movie stars themselves, including:&lt;ref name=Freese/&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt; [[Hank Bell]] (300 films, between 1920 and 1952); [[Bill Gillis]]; [[Buck Jones]]; [[John Montgomery (equestrian)|Jack Montgomery]] (initially worked as Tom Mix's body-double); and [[Jack Padjeon]] (first appeared in 1923, played [[Wild Bill Hickok]] in the [[John Ford]] directed ''[[The Iron Horse]]'' in 1924).&lt;ref name=TiHWestern/&gt; But the best known stuntman turned star was probably [[Yakima Canutt]], who with his apprentices - who included [[John Wayne]]&lt;ref name=ActArtDe/&gt; - devised during the 1930s new safety devices, including: the 'L' [[stirrup]] which allowed a rider to fall off a horse without getting hung in the stirrup; and cabling equipment to cause spectacular wagon crashes, while releasing the team. A focus on replicable and safe stunts saved producers money and prevented lost down-time for directors through reduced accidents and injury to performers.&lt;ref name=LPFHM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonepinefilmhistorymuseum.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=288&amp;Itemid=73|title=Stuntmen &amp; Women |publisher=[[Lone Pine Film History Museum]]|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stuntmen were now an integral part of a films drawing power, helping to fill cinemas with thrill seeking patrons anxious to see the new Saturday matinee.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt;

===''Safety Last!''===
[[File:Safetylast-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harold Lloyd]] in 1923's ''[[Safety Last!]]'', hanging (safely) from the clock tower. Lloyd may have been influenced by the real life stunts of [[Rodman Law]] a decade earlier]]
Producer/actor [[Harold Lloyd]]'s film ''[[Safety Last!]]'' of 1923, is often considered one of the first to deploy thought-through safety devices and pre-planning in the execution of its filming and stunts. In the script, Lloyd's "country boy" character goes to the city to be a success, and ends up climbing a tall building as a stunt. Critics at the time claimed it to be the most spectacular daredevil thrill comedy.

The entire stunt sequence was shot on location the Atlantic Hotel in [[Broadway, Los Angeles]] (demolished 1957), at actual heights. But the films directors [[Fred C. Newmeyer]] and [[Sam Taylor (director)|Sam Taylor]] planned into two safety features:
*Mattresses occupied hidden platforms under each performer, who also was wearing a heavily padded corset under their clothing
*Each performer was attached via a safety harness to a secure safety wire, attached to the building
Producer [[Hal Roach]] and Lloyd had been forced into the costs of planning and construction of these safety devices, as simply without them the city commissioners had refused the production a [[film permit]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Lloyd, ever curious, decided after filming had completed to use a life-size cotton-filled dummy to see what the effect of an accident would have been should they have needed to use the required safety devices. On seeing the results, he didn't film another production without them.&lt;ref name=ActArtDe/&gt;

In 1983 in his personal homage to Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd called ''[[Project A]]'', [[Jackie Chan]] repeats some of the most famous scenes from the early film era, including Lloyd's clock scene from ''Safety Last!'' While Lloyd only hanged from the tower, Chan took it a step further and actually fell from the tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-6-most-needlessly-dangerous-jackie-chan-stunts/|title=The 6 Most Needlessly Dangerous Jackie Chan Stunts|author=Seanbaby|publisher=Cracked.com|date=August 11, 2012|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0085127|'A' gai wak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swashbuckler films===
{{main|Swashbuckler film}}
Swashbuckler films were a unique genre of action movies, utilising the earlier developed art of [[cinematic fencing]], a combination of stage combat and fencing. The most famous of these were the films of [[Douglas Fairbanks]], which defined the genre. The stories came from romantic costume novels, particularly those of [[Alexandre Dumas]] and [[Rafael Sabatini]], and included triumphant, thrilling music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fosteronfilm.com/important/swash.htm Foster on Film].&lt;/ref&gt; There were three great cycles of swashbuckler films: the Douglas Fairbanks period from 1920 to 1929; the [[Errol Flynn]] period from 1935 to 1941; and a period in the 1950s heralded by films, including ''[[Ivanhoe (1952 film)|Ivanhoe]]'' (1952) and ''[[The Master of Ballantrae (film)|The Master of Ballantrae]]'' (1953), and the popularity of the British television series ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1955&amp;ndash;1959).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1136123/index.html Screen Online].&lt;/ref&gt;

The preference to employ ready existing professionals from outside the film industry, either as performers or doubles, continued in the period both up to and beyond [[World War II]], when again the industry was awash with young, fit men looking for work.&lt;ref name=Freese/&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt; However, in 1958 ''[[Thunder Road (film)|Thunder Road]]'' starring [[Robert Mitchum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0052293|Thunder Road}}&lt;/ref&gt; with stunt coordinator was [[Cary Loftin]] and a stunt team including [[Ray Austin (director)|Ray Austin]], Neil Castes Sr., [[Robert Hoy]], and [[Dale Van Sickel]], introduced the era of the [[car chase]] movie. With the later development of modern action movie, the accident rate of both stunt performers and movie stars started to quickly increase.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt; The stunt performers took resultantly action to professionalise their industry, with the creation of new stunt performer run registration, training, certification, and booking agencies.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuntmen.com/about.html|title=Steeped in Heritage &amp; History|publisher=Stuntmen's Association|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, modern stunt technology was developed, including [[air ram]]s, [[air bag]]s, and [[Squib (explosive)|bullet squibs]]. [[Dar Robinson]] invented the decelerator during this period, which used dragline cables rather than airbags for stunts that called for a jump from high places.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=[[Popular Mechanics]]|publisher=Hearst Magazines|date=Oct 1984|issn=0032-4558|pages=86,122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-development of this technology and professional performance training continues to evolve to the present, brought about through the need to not only create more visual impact on screen in the modern action movie era.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt; It also provides a safe platform to a new breed of trained professional stunt performers, including [[Bill Hickman]], [[Terry Richards (actor)|Terry Richards]], and motorcycle greats [[Bud Ekins]] and [[Evel Knievel]]. These new professionals were not only driven to create visual impact, but also perform seemingly impossible feats in a safe and repeatable manner.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt; Latterly came the fast action [[Martial arts movies]] as a distinct genre, originating for western consumption mainly from [[Hong Kong]] from the 1940s, choreographed and later acted in by stunt performers turned stars including [[Bruce Lee]] and [[Sonny Chiba]] from the 1960s, Kent Norman "Superkentman" Elofson, and latterly [[Jackie Chan]].&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt;

In 1982, [[Jackie Chan]] began experimenting with elaborate [[stunt]] action sequences in ''[[Dragon Lord]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragon Lord|publisher=Love HK Film|url=http://www.lovehkfilm.com/reviews_2/dragon_lord.htm|accessdate=2011-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured a pyramid fight scene that holds the record for the most [[take]]s required for a single scene, with 2900 takes,&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragon Lord (DVD Description)|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dragon-Lord-DVD-Jackie-Chan/dp/B0000A5BRV|accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the final fight scene where he performs various stunts, including one where he does a back flip off a [[loft]] and falls to the lower ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kicking and Screening: ''Wheels on Meals,'' ''Armour of God,'' ''Police Story,'' and more are graded with an eye for action|author=David Everitt|date=August 16, 1996|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,293788,00.html|accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, ''[[Project A]]'' saw the official formation of the [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team]] and added elaborate, dangerous stunts to the fights and typical slapstick humor (at one point, Chan falls from the top of a clock tower through a series of fabric canopies).

''[[Police Story (1985 film)|Police Story]]'' (1985) contained many large-scale action scenes, including an opening sequence featuring a [[car chase]] through a [[shanty town]], Chan stopping a [[double-decker bus]] with his service [[pistol|revolver]] and a climactic fight scene in a [[shopping mall]]. This final scene earned the film the nickname "Glass Story" by the crew, due to the huge number of panes of [[sugar glass]] that were broken. During a stunt in this last scene, in which Chan slides down a pole from several stories up, the lights covering the pole had heated it considerably, resulting in Chan suffering [[Burn#Classification by degree|second-degree burns]], particularly to his hands, as well as a back injury and dislocation of his pelvis upon landing.&lt;ref name="I Am Jackie Chan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/iamjackiechan/excerpt_aches.html|title=Jackie's Aches and Pains: It Only Hurts When I'm Not Laughing|author=[[Jackie Chan]]|publisher=[[Random House]]|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Hong Kong action movie]] stars who became known for performing elaborate stunts include Chan's [[Peking Opera School]] friends [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]], as well as "[[girls with guns]]" stars such as [[Michelle Yeoh]] and [[Moon Lee]].

==Future==
{{POV|section|date=June 2017}}
While modern [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) technology is considered by many stunt professionals{{Who|date=March 2015}} to potentially be curtailing the industry to but a shadow of its former self, the costs of CGI on most films and for most scenes presently far outweigh the benefits. While CGI allows directors to create stunts that would be very expensive, dangerous or simply impossible to perform with real stunt people,&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt; the backlash has resulted in a new genre of "real" movies marketed on the basis that the scenes are real and that no CGI has been used to create the final production.&lt;ref name=Freese/&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt;

==Awards==
There is no [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] category for stunt performance, but in 1967, Yakima Canutt was awarded an honorary Oscar for his stunt career.&lt;ref name=Freese/&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt; The [[Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] awards an [[Emmy]] for [[stunt coordinator]]s.

The [[Taurus World Stunt Awards]] gives stunt people their own annual awards, but also through its [[foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] offers financial support to stunt men around the world who have been injured while on the job.&lt;ref name=Freese/&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt;

==Deaths==
Although the stories that stuntmen died while filming ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'' and ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'' are apocryphal myths, life-threatening injuries and deaths are not uncommon. Contracts often stipulate that the footage may be used if the performer is injured or dies during filming, and some filmmakers including Jackie Chan, consider it disrespectful not to do so.&lt;ref name=Guard184647&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-184647,00.html|title=Has a stuntman or stuntwoman performing a death-defying stunt in a film ever failed to defy death and instead been killed?|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the filming of ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962), a number of stunt performers and actors were injured, the most notable of which was [[Robert Drew Morgan|Robert Drew "Bob" Morgan]]. While filming a gunfight on a moving railroad flatcar loaded with logs, one of the chains that held the logs snapped, and Morgan was crushed by the falling timber.  Notwithstanding, this scene appeared fully in the film, in its entirety.  Morgan's wife, actress [[Yvonne De Carlo]], put her own career on hold, in order to nurse him back to health over five years; however, the couple later divorced in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/81689098|title=Robert Drew "Bob" Morgan|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Vasa''''' (or '''''Wasa''''')&lt;ref&gt;The original name of the ship was ''Vasen'' ("the fascine"), after the [[heraldry|heraldic symbol]] on the [[coat of arms]] of the [[House of Vasa]], which was also part of the coat of arms of Sweden at the time. ''Vasa'' has since become the most widely recognised name of the ship, largely because the Vasa Museum chose this form of the name as its 'official' orthography in the late 1980s. This spelling was adopted because it is the form preferred by modern Swedish language authorities, and conforms to the spelling reforms instituted in Sweden in the early 20th century.&lt;/ref&gt; is a retired [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[warship]] built between 1626 and 1628. The ship [[:wikt:founder#Verb|foundered]] after sailing about 1,300 m (1,400 yd) into its [[maiden voyage]] on 10 August 1628. It fell into obscurity after most of her valuable [[bronze]] [[cannon]]s were salvaged in the 17th century until she was located again in the late 1950s in a busy shipping lane just outside the [[Stockholm]] harbor. Salvaged with a largely intact hull in 1961, it was housed in a temporary museum called Wasavarvet ('The Wasa Shipyard') until 1988 and then moved permanently to the [[Vasa Museum]] in the [[Royal National City Park]]&lt;ref&gt;

Peter Clark), Historical Urban Studies Series (Eds. Jean-Luc Pinol &amp; Richard Rodger), Ashgate Publishing Limited, Aldershot, pp. 159-174.]&lt;/ref&gt; in Stockholm. The ship is one of Sweden's most popular tourist attractions and has been seen by over 35 million visitors since 1961.&lt;ref&gt;11&amp;nbsp;million at Wasavarvet 1961–88 and 18&amp;nbsp;million at the permanent museum since 1990. The total is based on statistics from the official website of the Vasa Museum: {{sv icon}} [http://vasamuseet.se/sv/Om/Vasamuseets-besokare/ "Museets besökare"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814170522/http://vasamuseet.se/sv/Om/Vasamuseets-besokare/ |date=14 August 2010 }}, 2011; [http://www.vasamuseet.se/sv/Press/Basmaterial/Vasas-sista-resa/ "Vasas sista färd"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818202918/http://www.vasamuseet.se/sv/Press/Basmaterial/Vasas-sista-resa/ |date=18 August 2010 }}, 2000(?).&lt;/ref&gt; Since her recovery, ''Vasa'' has become a widely recognised symbol of the Swedish '[[Swedish Empire|great power period]]' and is today a ''de facto'' standard in the media and among Swedes for evaluating the historical importance of shipwrecks.

The ship was built on the orders of the King of Sweden [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]] as part of the military expansion he initiated in a war with [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]] (1621–1629). It was constructed at the navy yard in Stockholm under a contract with private entrepreneurs in 1626–1627 and armed primarily with bronze cannons cast in Stockholm specifically for the ship. Richly decorated as a symbol of the king's ambitions for Sweden and himself, upon completion she was one of the most powerfully armed vessels in the world. However, ''Vasa'' was dangerously unstable and top-heavy with too much weight in the upper structure of the hull. Despite this lack of stability she was ordered to sea and foundered only a few minutes after encountering a wind stronger than a breeze. 

The order to sail was the result of a combination of factors. The king, who was leading the army in Poland at the time of her maiden voyage, was impatient to see her take up her station as [[flagship]] of the reserve squadron at [[Älvsnabben]] in the Stockholm Archipelago. At the same time the king's subordinates lacked the political courage to openly discuss the ship's problems or to have the maiden voyage postponed. An inquiry was organised by the [[Privy Council of Sweden|Swedish Privy Council]] to find those responsible for the disaster, but in the end no one was punished.

During the 1961 recovery, thousands of artifacts and the remains of at least 15 people were found in and around the ''Vasa'''s hull by [[Maritime archaeology|marine archaeologists]]. Among the many items found were clothing, weapons, cannons, tools, coins, cutlery, food, drink and six of the ten sails. The artifacts and the ship herself have provided scholars with invaluable insights into details of naval warfare, shipbuilding techniques and everyday life in early 17th-century Sweden.

== Historical background ==
[[File:Swedish Empire (1560-1815) en2.png|thumb|A map of Sweden's territorial gains and losses 1560–1815. In the years that ''Vasa'' was built and sank, Sweden still had not seized the southernmost of its present provinces, but possessed almost all of modern-day [[Finland]] and [[Estonia]] as well as [[Ingria]] and [[Karelia]].]]

During the 17th century, Sweden went from being a sparsely populated, poor, and peripheral northern European kingdom of little influence to one of the [[Great power|major powers]] in continental politics. Between 1611 and 1718 it was the dominant power in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], eventually gaining territory that encompassed the Baltic on all sides. This rise to prominence in international affairs and increase in military prowess, called ''[[Swedish Empire|stormaktstiden]]'' ('age of greatness' or 'great power period'), was made possible by a succession of able monarchs and the establishment of a powerful centralised government, supporting a highly efficient military organization. Swedish historians have described this as one of the more extreme examples of an early modern state using almost all of its available resources to wage war; the small northern kingdom transformed itself into a [[fiscal-military state]] and one of the most militarised states in history.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 36–39; see also Jan Glete's paper ''[http://www2.historia.su.se/personal/jan_glete/Glete-Swedish_Fiscal-military_State.pdf The Swedish fiscal-military state and its navy, 1521–1721]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]] (1594–1632) has been considered one of the most successful Swedish kings in terms of success in warfare. When ''Vasa'' was built, he had been in power for more than a decade. Sweden was embroiled in a [[Polish-Swedish War (1625–1629)|war with Poland-Lithuania]], and looked apprehensively at the development of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in present-day Germany. The war had been raging since 1618 and from a [[Protestant]] perspective it was not successful. The king's plans for a Polish campaign and for securing Sweden's interests required a strong naval presence in the Baltic.&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;Roberts (1953–58)&lt;/ref&gt;

The navy suffered several severe setbacks during the 1620s. In 1625, a squadron cruising in the [[Bay of Riga]] was caught in a storm and ten ships ran aground and were wrecked. In the [[Battle of Oliwa]] in 1627, a Swedish squadron was outmaneuvered and defeated by a Polish force and two large ships were lost. ''Tigern'' ('The Tiger'), which was the Swedish admiral's flagship, was captured by the Poles, and ''Solen'' ('The Sun') was blown up by her own crew when she was boarded and near capture. In 1628, three more large ships were lost in less than a month; Admiral [[Clas Fleming (admiral)|Klas Fleming]]'s flagship ''Kristina'' was wrecked in a storm in the [[Gulf of Danzig]], ''Riksnyckeln'' ('Key of the Realm') ran aground at Viksten in the southern archipelago of Stockholm and ''Vasa'' foundered on her maiden voyage. Gustavus Adolphus was engaged in naval warfare on several fronts, which further exacerbated the difficulties of the navy. In addition to battling the Polish navy, the Swedes were indirectly threatened by Imperial forces that had invaded [[Jutland]]. The Swedish king had little sympathy for the Danish king, [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]], and Denmark and Sweden had been bitter enemies for well over a century. However, Sweden feared a Catholic conquest of [[Copenhagen]] and [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]. This would have granted the Catholic powers control over the strategic passages between the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[North Sea]], which would be disastrous for Swedish interests.&lt;ref name="roberts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hocker in Vasa I, p. 47"&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; As it turned out, the Imperial occupation of Denmark ended before Swedish intervention was necessary, and a squadron assigned to assist Denmark was retasked to help lift the Imperial siege of Stralsund.

Until the early 17th century, the Swedish navy was composed primarily of small to medium-sized ships with a single gundeck, normally armed with 12-pounder and smaller cannons; these ships were cheaper than larger ships and were well-suited for escort and patrol. They also suited the prevailing tactical thinking within the navy, which emphasised boarding as the decisive moment in a naval battle rather than gunnery. The king, who was a keen artillerist, saw the potential of ships as gun platforms, and large, heavily armed ships made a more dramatic statement in the political theater of naval power. Beginning with ''Vasa'', he ordered a series of ships with two full gundecks, outfitted with much heavier guns.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker (2011), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Five such ships were built after ''Vasa'' (''Äpplet'', ''Kronan'', ''Scepter'' and ''Göta Ark'') before the Privy Council cancelled the orders for the others after the king's death in 1632. These ships, especially ''Kronan'' and ''Scepter'', were much more successful and served as flagships in the Swedish navy until the 1660s. The second of the so-called ''regalskepp'' (usually translated as 'royal ships'),&lt;ref&gt;''Vasa'' was actually never referred to as a ''regalskepp'' before she was lost, but was classified as one afterwards; Hocker (2011), pp. 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Äpplet'' ('The Apple'; the Swedish term for the [[globus cruciger]]), was built simultaneously with ''Vasa''. The only significant difference between the design of ''Vasa'' and her sister ship was an increase in width of about a metre (3.1&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 39; for more on ''Äpplet'', see {{sv}} Jan Glete, "[https://www.webcitation.org/5hFXgHHMe?url=http://www.marinarkeologi.net/pdf/mt4-2002_16-21.pdf Gustav II Adolfs Äpplet]" in ''Marinarkeologisk tidskrift'' nr 4, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
[[Image:Vasa Top Deck.jpg|thumb|left|''Vasa's'' [[Port (nautical)|port]] side]]

In the early 1620s, work at the Stockholm navy yard was led by a pair of Dutch-born entrepreneurs, Antonius Monier and master shipwright [[Henrik Hybertsson]], who was usually referred to as 'Master Henrik'. When a new contract for operation of the navy yard was negotiated in the winter of 1624–1625, Monier withdrew and Master Henrik took on a young merchant from Amsterdam, Arendt de Groote, as partner. On 16 January 1625, Henrik and Arendt signed a contract to build four ships, two larger with a [[keel]] length of 128 feet (38 m) and two smaller, with dimensions to match the earlier ship ''Gustavus''.

Master Henrik and Arendt de Groote began buying the raw materials needed for the first ships in 1625, purchasing timber from individual estates in Sweden as well as buying rough-sawn planking in [[Riga]], Königsberg (modern [[Kaliningrad]]), and [[Amsterdam]]. As they prepared to begin the first of the new ships in the autumn of 1625, Henrik corresponded with the king through the Vice Admiral Fleming about which ship to build first. The loss of ten ships in the Bay of Riga led the king to propose building two ships of a new, medium size as a quick compromise, and he sent a specification for this, a ship which would be 120 feet (35.6 m) long on the keel. Henrik declined, since he had already cut the timber for a large and a small ship. He laid the keel for a larger ship in late February or early March 1626.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Master Henrik never saw Vasa completed; he fell ill in late 1625, and by the summer of 1626 he had handed over supervision of the work in the yard to another Dutch shipwright, Henrik 'Hein' Jacobsson. He died in the spring of 1627, probably about the same time as the ship was launched.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Henrik Hybertsson, the responsibility to manage the construct the ship was inherited by his widow [[Margareta Hybertsson]].

After launching, work continued on finishing the upper deck, the sterncastle, the [[beakhead]] and the rigging. Sweden had still not developed a sizeable sailcloth industry, and material had to be ordered from abroad. In the contract for the maintenance of rigging, French sailcloth was specified, but the cloth for the sails of ''Vasa'' most likely came from Holland.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker (2011), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The sails were made mostly of [[hemp]] and partly of [[flax]]. The rigging was made entirely of hemp imported from [[Latvia]] through Riga. The king visited the shipyard in January 1628 and made what was probably his only visit aboard the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 47–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Vasas hull profile.jpg|thumb|upright|A model showing a cross section of ''Vasa''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s hull, illustrating the shallow [[hold (ship)|hold]] and two [[gun deck]]s]]

In the summer of 1628, the captain responsible for supervising construction of the ship, Söfring Hansson, arranged for the ship's stability to be demonstrated for the Vice Admiral responsible for procurement, Klas Fleming, who had recently arrived in Stockholm from Prussia. Thirty men ran back and forth across the upper deck to start the ship rolling, but the admiral stopped the test after they had made only three trips, as he feared the ship would capsize. According to testimony by the ship's master, Göran Mattson, Fleming remarked that he wished the king were at home. Gustavus Adolphus had been sending a steady stream of letters insisting that the ship put to sea as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="Vasa"&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been much speculation about whether ''Vasa'' was lengthened during construction and whether an additional gun deck was added late during the build. Little evidence suggests that ''Vasa'' was substantially modified after the keel was laid. Ships contemporary to ''Vasa'' that were elongated were cut in half and new timbers spliced between the existing sections, making the addition readily identifiable, but no such addition can be identified in the hull, nor is there any evidence for any late additions of a second gundeck. The king ordered 72 24-pound cannons for the ship on 5 August 1626, and this was too many to fit on a single gun deck. Since the king's order was issued less than five months after construction started, it would have come early enough for the second deck to be included in the design. The French ''Galion du Guise'', the ship used as a model for ''Vasa'', according to Arendt de Groote, also had two gun decks.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; [[3D scanner|Laser measurements]] of ''Vasa's'' structure conducted in 2007–2011 confirmed that no major changes were implemented during construction, but that the centre of gravity was too high.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker (2011), pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vasa'' was an early example of a warship with two full gun decks, and was built when the theoretical principles of shipbuilding were still poorly understood. There is no evidence that Henrik Hybertsson had ever built a ship like it before, and two gundecks is a much more complicated compromise in seaworthiness and firepower than a single gundeck. Safety margins at the time were also far below anything that would be acceptable today. Combined with the fact that 17th-century warships were built with intentionally high superstructures (to be used as firing platforms), this made ''Vasa'' a risky undertaking.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Armament ===
[[File:Vasa-lower gun deck-2.jpg|thumb|left|The inside of the lower gun deck looking toward the bow]]

''Vasa'' was built during a time of transition in naval tactics, from an era when boarding was still one of the primary ways of fighting enemy ships to an era of the strictly organised [[ship-of-the-line]] and a focus on victory through superior gunnery. ''Vasa'' was armed with powerful guns and built with a high stern, which would act as a firing platform in boarding actions for some of the 300 soldiers she was supposed to carry, but the high-sided hull and narrow upper deck were not optimised for boarding. She was neither the largest ship ever built, nor the one carrying the greatest number of guns. What made her arguably the most powerful warship of the time was the combined weight of shot that could be fired from the cannon of one side: 588 pounds (267&amp;nbsp;kg), excluding ''stormstycken'', guns used for firing anti-personnel ammunition instead of solid shot. This was the largest concentration of artillery in a single warship in the Baltic at the time, perhaps in all of northern Europe, and it was not until the 1630s that a ship with more firepower was built. This large amount of naval artillery was placed on a ship that was quite small relative to the armament carried. By comparison, ''[[USS Constitution]]'', a famous Napoleonic era frigate built 169 years after ''Vasa'', had roughly the same firepower, but was over 700&amp;nbsp;[[tonnes]] heavier.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Constitution'', however, belonged to a later era of naval warfare that employed the [[line of battle]]-tactic, where ships fought in single file (or ''line ahead'') while the group as a whole attempted to present the batteries of one side toward the enemy. The guns would be aimed in the same direction and fire could be concentrated on a single target. In the 17th century, tactics involving organised formations of large fleets had still not been developed. Rather, ships would fight individually or in small improvised groups, and focused on boarding. ''Vasa'', though possessing a formidable battery, was built with these tactics in mind, and therefore lacked a unified [[broadside]] with guns that were all aimed in roughly the same direction. Rather, the guns were intended to be fired independently and were arranged according to the curvature of the hull, meaning that the ship would be bristled with artillery in all directions, covering virtually all angles.&lt;ref&gt;The guns facing fight aft, the ''stern chasers'', were still not on board when the ship sank, however; Hocker (2011) pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval gunnery in the 17th century was still in its infancy. Guns were expensive and had a much longer lifespan than any warship. Guns with a lifetime of over a century were not unheard of, while most warships would be used for only 15 to 20 years. In Sweden and many other European countries, a ship would normally not 'own' its guns, but would be issued armament from the armory for every campaign season. Ships were therefore usually fitted with guns of very diverse age and size. What allowed ''Vasa'' to carry so much firepower was not merely that an unusually large number of guns were crammed into a relatively small ship, but also that the 46 main 24-pounder guns were of a new and standardised lightweight design, cast in a single series at the state gun foundry in Stockholm, under the direction of the Swiss-born founder Medardus Gessus. Two additional 24-pounders, of a heavier and older design, were mounted in the bows, the so-called ''[[Chase gun|bow chasers]]''. Four more heavy guns were intended for the stern, but the cannon foundry could not cast guns as fast as the navy yard could build ships, and ''Vasa'' waited nearly a year after construction was finished for its armament. When the ship sailed in August 1628, eight of the planned armament of 72 guns had still not been delivered. All cannons during this time had to be made from individually made moulds that could not be reused, but ''Vasa's'' guns had such uniform precision in their manufacturing that their primary dimensions varied by only a few millimetres, and their bores were almost exactly 146&amp;nbsp;mm (5.7&amp;nbsp;in). The remaining armament of ''Vasa'' consisted of eight 3-pounders, six large caliber ''stormstycken'' (similar to what the English called [[howitzer]]s) for use during boarding actions, and two 1-pound [[falconet (cannon)|falconets]]. Also included on board were 894 kilograms (1,970&amp;nbsp;lb) of [[gunpowder]] and over 1,000 shot of various types for the guns.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 47–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ornamentation ===
[[Image:Vasa stern color model.jpg|thumb|A 1:10 scale model of the ship on display at the [[Vasa Museum]]. The sculptures are painted in what are believed to be the original colors.]]
As was the custom with warships at the time, ''Vasa'' was decorated with sculptures intended to glorify the authority, wisdom and martial prowess of the monarch and also to deride, taunt and intimidate the enemy. The sculptures made up a considerable part of the effort and cost of building the ship. The symbolism used in decorating the ship was mostly based on the [[Renaissance]] idealization of Roman and Greek antiquity, which had been imported from Italy through German and Dutch artists. Imagery borrowed from Mediterranean antiquity dominates the motifs, but also include figures from the Old Testament and even a few from [[ancient Egypt]]. Many of the figures are in Dutch [[grotesque]] style, depicting fantastic and frightening creatures, including mermaids, [[wild men]], sea monsters and [[Triton (mythology)|tritons]]. The decoration inside the ship is much sparser and is largely confined to the steerage and the great cabin, at the after end of the upper gundeck.

Residues of paint have been found on many sculptures and on other parts of the ship. The entire ornamentation was once painted in vivid colors. The sides of the [[beakhead]] (the protruding structure below the [[bowsprit]]), the bulwarks (the protective railing around the weather deck), the roofs of the [[quarter gallery|quarter galleries]], and the background of the [[Transom (nautical)|transom]] (the flat surface at the stern of the ship) were all painted red, while the sculptures were decorated in bright colors, and the dazzling effect of these was in some places emphasised with [[gold leaf]]. Previously, it was believed that the background color had been blue and that all sculptures had been almost entirely gilded, and this is reflected in many paintings of ''Vasa'' from the 1970s to the early 1990s, such as the lively and dramatic drawings of [[Björn Landström]] or the painting by Francis Smitheman.&lt;ref&gt;See sample from Smitheman's website here [http://www.smitheman.com/004-full.html].&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, this view was revised and the colors are properly reflected in more recent reproductions of the ship's decoration by maritime painter [[Tim Thompson (artist)|Tim Thompson]] and the 1:10 scale model in the museum. ''Vasa'' is an example not so much of the heavily gilded sculptures of early [[Baroque]] art but rather 'the last gasps of the [[medieval art|medieval]] sculpture tradition' with its fondness for gaudy colors, in a style that today would be considered extravagant or even vulgar.&lt;ref name="Hocker in Vasa I, p. 47"/&gt;

[[File:Vasaskultpurrepliker.jpg|thumb|left|Modern replicas in the [[Vasa Museum]] of some of the ship's sculptures that have been painted in what are believed to be the original colors.]]
The sculptures are carved out of [[oak]], [[pine]] or [[Tilia|linden]], and many of the larger pieces, like the huge 3-metre (10&amp;nbsp;ft) long figurehead lion, consist of several parts carved individually and fitted together with bolts. Close to 500 sculptures, most of which are concentrated on the high stern and its galleries and on the beakhead, are found on the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Soop (1986), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of [[Hercules]] appears as a pair of pendants, one younger and one older, on each side of the lower stern galleries; the pendants depict opposite aspects of the ancient hero, who was extremely popular during antiquity as well as in 17th-century European art. On the transom are biblical and nationalistic symbols and images. A particularly popular motif is the lion, which can be found as the [[Mascaron (architecture)|mascarons]] originally fitted on the insides of the gunport doors, grasping the royal coat of arms on either side, the figurehead, and even clinging to the top of the rudder. Each side of the beakhead originally had 20 figures (though only 19 have actually been found) that depicted [[Roman emperor]]s from [[Tiberius]] to [[Septimius Severus]]. Overall, almost all heroic and positive imagery is directly or indirectly identified with the king and was originally intended to glorify him as a wise and powerful ruler. The only actual portrait of the king, however, is located at the very top of the transom in the stern. Here he is depicted as a young boy with long, flowing hair, being crowned by two [[griffin]]s representing the king's father, [[Charles IX of Sweden|Charles IX]].&lt;ref&gt;Before being crowned as king, Charles had been duke of [[Södermanland]], whose coat of arms include a griffin [[segreant]], standing with its front legs raised; Soop (1986), pp. 18–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Vasa color pigments.jpg|thumb|A recreation of the color pigments that were used by the naval shipyard where the ship was built; exhibit at the [[Vasa Museum]].]]
A team of at least six expert sculptors worked for a minimum of two years on the sculptures, most likely with the assistance of an unknown number of apprentices and assistants. No direct credit for any of the sculptures has been provided, but the distinct style of one of the most senior artists, Mårten Redtmer, is clearly identifiable. Other accomplished artists, like Hans Clausink, Johan Didrichson Tijsen (or ''Thessen'' in Swedish) and possibly Marcus Ledens, are known to have been employed for extensive work at the naval yards at the time ''Vasa'' was built, but their respective styles are not distinct enough to associate them directly with any specific sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;Soop (1986), pp. 241–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic quality of the sculptures varies considerably, and about four distinct styles can be identified. The only artist who has been positively associated with various sculptures is Mårten Redtmer, whose style has been described as 'powerful, lively and naturalistic'.&lt;ref&gt;Soop (1986), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; He was responsible for a considerable number of the sculptures. These include some of the most important and prestigious pieces: the figurehead lion, the royal coat of arms, and the sculpture of the king at the top of the transom. Two of the other styles are described as 'elegant ... a little stereotyped and manneristic', and of a 'heavy, leisurely but nevertheless rich and lively style', respectively. The fourth and last style, deemed clearly inferior to the other three, is described as 'stiff and ungainly'&lt;ref&gt;Quotes from Soop (1986), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; and was done by other carvers, perhaps even apprentices, of lesser skill.

== Maiden voyage ==
[[Image:Voyage of the Vasa 2.svg|thumb|Central [[Stockholm]] and the movements of ''Vasa'' from Skeppsgården ('navy yard') to the anchoring place near the old royal castle where it was fitted and armed in the spring of 1628, and finally the location where it foundered and sank.]]

On 10 August 1628, Captain Söfring Hansson ordered ''Vasa'' to depart on her maiden voyage to the naval station at [[Älvsnabben]]. The day was calm, and the only wind was a light breeze from the southwest. The ship was [[Warping (sailing)|warped]] (hauled by anchor) along the eastern waterfront of the city to the southern side of the harbor, where four sails were set, and the ship made way to the east. The gun ports were open, and the guns were out to fire a salute as the ship left Stockholm.&lt;ref name="Vasa"/&gt;

As ''Vasa'' passed under the [[Lee side|lee]] of the bluffs to the south (what is now [[Södermalm]]), a gust of wind filled her sails, and she [[Heel (sailing)|heeled]] suddenly to [[Port (nautical)|port]]. The [[Sheet (sailing)|sheets]] were cast off, and the ship slowly [[Metacentric height|righted herself]] as the gust passed. At Tegelviken, where there is a gap in the bluffs, an even stronger gust again forced the ship onto its port side, this time pushing the open lower gunports under the surface, allowing water to rush in onto the lower gundeck. The water building up on the deck quickly exceeded the ship's minimal ability to right itself, and water continued to pour in until it ran down into the hold; the ship quickly sank to a depth of 32&amp;nbsp;m (105&amp;nbsp;ft) only 120&amp;nbsp;m (390&amp;nbsp;ft) from shore. Survivors clung to debris or the upper masts, which were still above the surface, to save themselves, and many nearby boats rushed to their aid, but despite these efforts and the short distance to land, 30 people perished with the ship, according to reports. ''Vasa'' sank in full view of a crowd of hundreds, if not thousands, of mostly ordinary Stockholmers who had come to see the great ship set sail. The crowd included foreign ambassadors, in effect spies of Gustavus Adolphus' allies and enemies, who also witnessed the catastrophe.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inquest ===
The Council sent a letter to the king the day after the loss, telling him of the sinking, but it took over two weeks to reach him in Poland. 'Imprudence and negligence' must have been the cause, he wrote angrily in his reply, demanding in no uncertain terms that the guilty parties be punished.&lt;ref name="kv2535"/&gt; Captain Söfring Hansson, who survived the disaster, was immediately taken for questioning. Under initial interrogation, he swore that the guns had been properly secured and that the crew was sober. A full inquest before a tribunal of members of the Privy Council and Admiralty took place at the [[Tre Kronor (castle)|Royal Palace]] on 5 September 1628. Each of the surviving officers was questioned as was the supervising shipwright and a number of expert witnesses. Also present at the inquest was the Admiral of the Realm, [[Carl Gyllenhielm|Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm]]. The object of the inquest was as much or more to find a scapegoat as to find out why the ship had sunk. Whoever the committee might find guilty for the fiasco would face a severe penalty.&lt;ref name="kv2535"&gt;Kvarning (1998), pp. 25–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving crew members were questioned one by one about the handling of the ship at the time of the disaster. Was it rigged properly for the wind? Was the crew sober? Was the ballast properly stowed? Were the guns properly secured? However, no-one was prepared to take the blame. Crewmen and contractors formed two camps; each tried to blame the other, and everyone swore he had done his duty without fault and it was during the inquest that the details of the stability demonstration were revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Kvarning (1998), pp. 29–35; Hocker in Cederlund (2006); pp. 55–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, attention was directed to the shipbuilders. 'Why did you build the ship so narrow, so badly and without enough bottom that it capsized?' the prosecutor asked the shipwright Jacobsson.&lt;ref name="Vasa_2"&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobsson stated that he built the ship as directed by Henrik Hybertsson (long since dead and buried), who in turn had followed the specification approved by the king. Jacobsson had in fact widened the ship by 1 foot 5 inches (c. 42&amp;nbsp;cm) after taking over responsibility for the construction, but construction of the ship was too far advanced to allow further widening.&lt;ref name="Vasa_2"/&gt;

In the end, no guilty party could be found. The answer Arendt de Groote gave when asked by the court why the ship sank was 'Only God knows'. Gustavus Adolphus had approved all measurements and armaments, and the ship was built according to the instructions and loaded with the number of guns specified. In the end, no-one was punished or found guilty for negligence, and the blame effectively fell on Henrik Hybertsson.&lt;ref&gt;Kvarning (1998), pp. 25–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Vasa'' as a wreck ==
[[Image:17th century salvaging.jpg|thumb|Illustration from a treatise on salvaging from 1734, showing the traditional method of raising a wreck with the help of [[anchor]]s and ships or [[hulk (ship)|hulks]] as [[Float (nautical)|pontoons]], basically the same method that was used to raise ''Vasa'' in the 20th century.]]

Less than three days after the disaster, a contract was signed for the ship to be raised. However, those efforts were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Hafström in Vasa I, p. 69"&gt;Hafström in Cederlund (2006), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest attempts at raising ''Vasa'' by English engineer Ian Bulmer, resulted in righting the ship but also got it more securely stuck in the mud and was most likely one of the biggest impediments to the earliest attempts at recovery.&lt;ref name="Hafström in Vasa I, p. 69"/&gt; Salvaging technology in the early 17th century was much more primitive than today, but the recovery of ships used roughly the same principles as were used to raise ''Vasa'' more than 300 years later. Two ships or hulks were placed parallel to either side above the wreck, and ropes attached to several [[anchor]]s were sent down and hooked to the ship. The two hulks were filled with as much water as was safe, the ropes tightened, and the water pumped out. The sunken ship then rose with the ships on the surface and could be towed to shallower waters. The process was then repeated until the entire ship was successfully raised above water level. Even if the underwater weight of ''Vasa'' was not great, the mud in which it had settled made it sit more secure on the bottom and required considerable lifting power to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Hafström in Cederlund (2006), pp. 98–104.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 30 years after the ship's sinking, in 1663–1665, Albreckt von Treileben and Andreas Peckell mounted an effort to recover the valuable guns. With a simple [[diving bell]], the team of Swedish and Finnish divers retrieved more than 50 of them.&lt;ref&gt;Hafström in Cederlund (2006), pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such activity waned when it became clear that the ship could not be raised by the technology of the time. However, ''Vasa'' did not fall completely into obscurity after the recovery of the guns. The ship was mentioned in several histories of Sweden and the Swedish Navy, and the location of the wreck appeared on harbor charts of Stockholm in the 19th century. In 1844, the navy officer Anton Ludwig Fahnehjelm turned in a request for salvaging rights to the ship, claiming he had located it. Fahnehjelm was an inventor who designed an early form of light diving suit and had previously been involved in other salvage operations. There were dives made on the wreck in 1895–1896, and a commercial salvage company applied for a permit to raise or salvage the wreck in 1920, but this was turned down. In 1999, a witness also claimed that his father, a petty officer in the Swedish navy, had taken part in diving exercises on ''Vasa'' in the years before World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that anyone visited the wreck site after this until the beginning of the modern ''Vasa'' project.

=== Deterioration ===
[[File:Vasa-knightheads.jpg|thumb|left|Two of the knightheads, posts used to fasten ropes, on the weather deck. The details of carved heads have been eroded almost beyond recognition by the currents of [[Stockholms ström]].]]
In the 333 years that ''Vasa'' lay on the bottom of Stockholm harbor (called [[Stockholms ström]], 'the Stream', in Swedish), the ship and its contents were subject to several destructive forces, first among which were decomposition and erosion. Among the first things to decompose were the thousands of iron bolts that held the [[beakhead]] and much of the sterncastle together, and this included all of the ship's wooden sculptures. Almost all of the iron on the ship rusted away within a few years of the sinking, and only large objects, such as anchors, or items made of cast iron, such as cannonballs, survived. Organic materials fared better in the [[Hypoxia (environmental)#Aquatic hypoxia|anaerobic]] conditions, and so wood, cloth and leather are often in very good condition, but objects exposed to the currents were eroded by the sediment in the water, so that some are barely recognizable.&lt;ref name="Hocker pp. 153"&gt;Hocker &amp; Wendel in Cederlund (2006), pp. 153–170.&lt;/ref&gt; Objects which fell off the hull into the mud after the nails corroded through were well protected, so that many of the sculptures still retain areas of paint and gilding. Of the human remains, most of the soft tissue was quickly consumed by bacteria, fish and crustaceans, leaving only the bones, which were often held together only by clothing, although in one case, hair, nails and brain tissue survived.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 146–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

The parts of the hull held together by joinery and wooden treenails remained intact for as much as two centuries, suffering gradual erosion of surfaces exposed to the water, unless they were disturbed by outside forces. 
Eventually the entire sterncastle, the high, aft portion of the ship that housed the officers' quarters and held up the transom, gradually collapsed into the mud with all the decorative sculptures. The [[quarter gallery|quarter galleries]], which were merely nailed to the sides of the sterncastle, collapsed fairly quickly and were found lying almost directly below their original locations.
&lt;ref name="Hocker pp. 153"/&gt;

Human activity was the most destructive factor, as the initial salvage efforts, the recovery of the guns, and the final salvage in the 20th century all left their marks. Peckell and Treileben broke up and removed much of the planking of the weather deck to get to the cannons on the decks below. Peckell reported that he had recovered 30 cartloads of wood from the ship; these might have included not just planking and structural details but also some of the sculptures which today are missing, such as the life-size Roman warrior near the bow and the sculpture of [[Septimius Severus]] that adorned the port side of the [[beakhead]].&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Since ''Vasa'' lay in a busy shipping channel, ships occasionally dropped anchor over the ship, and one large anchor demolished most of the upper sterncastle, probably in the 19th century. Construction work in Stockholm harbor usually results in blasting of bedrock, and the resulting tonnes of rubble were often dumped in the harbor; some of this landed on the ship, causing further damage to the stern and the upper deck.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Vasa'' rediscovered ===
In the early 1950s, amateur [[archaeology|archaeologist]] [[Anders Franzén]] considered the possibility of recovering wrecks from the cold [[brackish]] waters of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] because, he reasoned, they were free from the [[shipworm]] ''Teredo navalis'', which usually destroys submerged wood rapidly in warmer, saltier seas. Franzén had previously been successful in locating wrecks such as ''Riksäpplet'' and ''Lybska Svan'', and after long and tedious research he began looking for ''Vasa'' as well. He spent many years probing the waters without success around the many assumed locations of the wreckage. He did not succeed until, based on accounts of an unknown topographical anomaly just south of the Gustav V dock on [[Beckholmen]], he narrowed his search. In 1956, with a home-made, gravity-powered coring probe, he located a large wooden object almost parallel to the mouth of dock on Beckholmen. The location of the ship received considerable attention, even if the identification of the ship could not be determined without closer investigation. Soon after the announcement of the find, planning got underway to determine how to excavate and raise ''Vasa''. The [[Swedish Navy]] was involved from the start, as were various museums and the National Heritage board, representatives of which eventually formed the ''Vasa'' Committee, the predecessor of the ''Vasa'' Board.&lt;ref&gt;''Vasa I'', Cederlund and Hocker, pp. 172–180&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Zetterström nozzle1.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Zetterström nozzle]], designed to expel equal amounts of water both forwards and backwards for recoilless operation under water.]]

=== Recovery ===
A number of possible recovery methods were proposed, including filling the ship with ping-pong balls and freezing it in a block of ice, but the method chosen by the Vasa Board (which succeeded the Vasa Committee) was essentially the same one attempted immediately after the sinking. Divers spent two years digging six tunnels under the ship for steel cable slings, which were taken to a pair of lifting [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoons]] at the surface. The work under the ship was extremely dangerous, requiring the divers to cut tunnels through the clay with high-pressure water jets and suck up the resulting slurry with a dredge, all while working in total darkness with hundreds of tonnes of mud-filled ship overhead.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), pp. 234–244.&lt;/ref&gt; A persisting risk was that the wreck could shift or settle deeper into the mud while a diver was working in a tunnel, trapping him underneath the wreckage. The almost vertical sections of the tunnels near the side of the hull could also potentially collapse and bury a diver inside.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the dangerous conditions, more than 1,300 dives were made in the [[Marine salvage|salvage]] operation without any serious accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Kvarning (1998), pp. 61–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each time the pontoons were pumped full, the cables tightened and the pontoons were pumped out, the ship was brought a metre closer to the surface. In a series of 18 lifts in August and September 1959, the ship was moved from depth of 32 metres (105&amp;nbsp;ft) to 16 metres (52&amp;nbsp;ft) in the more sheltered area of Kastellholmsviken, where divers could work more safely to prepare for the final lift.&lt;ref&gt;Kvarning (1998), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of a year and a half, a small team of commercial divers cleared debris and mud from the upper decks to lighten the ship, and made the hull as watertight as possible. The gun ports were closed by means of temporary lids, a temporary replacement of the collapsed sterncastle was constructed, and many of the holes from the iron bolts that had rusted away were plugged. The final lift began on 8 April 1961, and on the morning of 24 April, ''Vasa'' was ready to return to the world for the first time in 333 years. Press from all over the world, television cameras, 400 invited guests on barges and boats, and thousands of spectators on shore watched as the first timbers broke the surface. The ship was then emptied of water and mud and towed to the Gustav V [[dry dock]] on Beckholmen, where the ship was floated on its own keel onto a concrete pontoon, on which the hull still stands.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), pp. 285–290.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the end of 1961 to December 1988, ''Vasa'' was housed in a temporary facility called Wasavarvet ('The Vasa Shipyard'), which included exhibit space as well as the activities centred on the ship. A building was erected over the ship on its pontoon, but it was very cramped, making conservation work awkward. Visitors could view the ship from just two levels, and the maximum viewing distance was in most places only a couple of metres, which made it difficult for viewers to get an overall view of the ship. In 1981, the Swedish government decided that a permanent building was to be constructed, and a design competition was organised. The winning design, by the Swedish architects Månsson and Dahlbäck, called for a large hall over the ship in a polygonal, industrial style. Ground was broken in 1987, and ''Vasa'' was towed into the half-finished [[Vasa Museum]] in December 1988. The museum was officially opened to the public in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Kvarning (1998), pp. 163–173.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeology ==
''Vasa'' posed an unprecedented challenge for archaeologists. Never before had a four-story structure, with most of its original contents largely undisturbed, been available for excavation.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund &amp; Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions under which the team had to work added to the difficulties. The ship had to be kept wet in order that it not dry out and crack before it could be properly conserved. Digging had to be performed under a constant drizzle of water and in a sludge-covered mud that could be more than one metre (approximately three feet) deep. In order to establish find locations, the hull was divided into several sections demarcated by the many structural beams, the decking and by a line drawn along the centre of the ship from stern to bow. For the most part, the decks were excavated individually, though at times work progressed on more than one deck level simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund &amp; Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finds ===
[[File:Brädspel - Vasamuseet - 25364.jpg|thumb|A [[Tables (board game)#Sweden|tables]] set found on ''Vasa'', complete with [[dice]] and markers]]
''Vasa'' had four preserved decks: the upper and lower gun decks, the hold and the [[Orlop deck|orlop]]. Because of the constraints of preparing the ship for conservation, the archaeologists had to work quickly, in 13-hour shifts during the first week of excavation. The upper gun deck was greatly disturbed by the various salvage projects between 1628 and 1961, and it contained not only material that had fallen down from the rigging and upper deck, but also more than three centuries of harbor refuse.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; The decks below were progressively less disturbed. The gundecks contained not just gun carriages, the three surviving cannons, and other objects of a military nature, but were also where most of the personal possessions of the sailors had been stored at the time of the sinking. These included a wide range of loose finds, as well as chests and casks with spare clothing and shoes, tools and materials for mending, money (in the form of low-denomination copper coins), privately purchased provisions, and all of the everyday objects needed for life at sea. Most of the finds are of wood, testifying not only to the simple life on board, but to the generally unsophisticated state of Swedish material culture in the early 17th century. The lower decks were primarily used for storage, and so the hold was filled with barrels of provisions and gunpowder, coils of anchor cable, iron shot for the guns, and the personal possessions of some of the officers. On the orlop deck, a small compartment contained six of the ship's ten sails, rigging spares, and the working parts for the ship's pumps. Another compartment contained the possessions of the ship's carpenter, including a large tool chest.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund &amp; Hocker in Cederlund (2006), pp. 302–305; for the item catalog, see [http://samlingar.maritima.se/marketstore/ this link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016142656/http://samlingar.maritima.se/marketstore/ |date=16 October 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ship itself had been salvaged and excavated, the site of the loss was excavated thoroughly during 1963–1967. This produced many items of rigging tackle as well as structural timbers that had fallen off, particularly from the beakhead and sterncastle. Most of the sculptures that had decorated the exterior of the hull were also found in the mud, along with the ship's anchors and the skeletons of at least four people. The last object to be brought up was the nearly 12-metre-long [[longboat]], called ''esping'' in Swedish, found lying parallel to the ship and believed to have been towed by ''Vasa'' when she sank.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund in Cederlund (2006), pp. 470–472.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the more recent objects contaminating the site were disregarded when the finds were registered, but some were the remains of the 1660s salvage efforts and others had their own stories to tell. Among the best known of these was a statue of 20th-century Finnish runner [[Paavo Nurmi]], which was placed on the ship as a prank by students of [[Helsinki University of Technology]] the night before the final lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Ilta-Sanomat]] |url=http://www.ttky.tut.fi/jaynat/nurmi.html |date=5 July 1961 |title=Vasan Veijarit |language=Finnish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040713124028/http://www.ttky.tut.fi/jaynat/nurmi.html |archivedate=13 July 2004 |accessdate=8 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Yle]] |date=28 April 2011 |title=Teekkarien kuningasjäynästä puoli vuosisataa |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/teekkarien_kuningasjaynasta_puoli_vuosisataa/5350123 |trans-title=Half a century of Techak's roar |language=Finnish |accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of sinking ==
[[Image:Vasa Cohen 20006123a hr.jpg|thumb|Former Vasa Museum Director Jervon(left) explaining aspects of the sinking of the ship to then US Defense Secretary [[William Cohen]] (centre) and Swedish Defense Minister [[Björn von Sydow]] (right).]]
''Vasa'' sank because it had very little [[initial stability]], which can be thought of as resistance to heeling over under the force of wind or waves acting on the hull. The reason for this is that the distribution of mass in the hull structure and the ballast, guns, provisions, and other objects loaded on board puts too much weight too high in the ship. The [[center of gravity|centre of gravity]] is too high, and so it takes very little force to make the ship heel over, and there is not enough [[righting moment]], force trying to make the ship return to an upright position. The reason that the ship has such a high centre of gravity is not due to the guns. These weighed little over 60 tonnes, or about 5% of the total displacement of the loaded ship. This is relatively low weight and should be bearable in a ship this size. The problem is in the hull construction itself. The part of the hull above the waterline is too high and too heavily built in relation to the amount of hull in the water. The headroom in the decks is higher than necessary for crewmen who were, on average, only 1.67 metres (5 feet 5½ inches) tall, and thus the weight of the decks and the guns they carry is higher above the waterline than needed. In addition, the deck beams and their supporting timbers are over-dimensioned and too closely spaced for the loads they carry, so they contribute too much weight to the already tall and heavy upper works.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker (2011), pp. 132–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of different measuring systems on either side of the vessel caused its mass to be distributed asymmetrically, heavier to port. During construction both [[Swedish feet]] and [[Amsterdam feet]] were in use by different teams. Archaeologists have found four rulers used by the workmen who built the ship. Two were calibrated in Swedish feet, which had 12 inches, while the other two measured Amsterdam feet, which had 11 inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2012-02-23/new-clues-emerge-centuries-old-swedish-shipwreck|title=New Clues Emerge in Centuries-Old Swedish Shipwreck|work=Public Radio International |date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the mathematical tools for calculating or predicting stability were still more than a century in the future, and 17th-century scientific ideas about how ships behaved in water were deeply flawed, the people associated with building and sailing ships for the Swedish navy were very much aware of the forces at work and their relationships to each other. In the last part of the inquest held after the sinking, a group of master shipwrights and senior naval officers were asked for their opinions about why the ship sank. Their discussion and conclusions show very clearly that they knew what had happened, and their verdict was summed up very clearly by one of the captains, who said that the ship did not have enough 'belly' to carry the heavy upperworks.&lt;ref name="Hocker (2011) 135-137"&gt;Hocker (2011), pp. 135–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ship design was not yet a science, but was an empirical process based on experience rather than calculation. Balancing the military need for firepower against the maritime need for seaworthiness resulted in some compromises that would not pass modern standards for stability. A ship with two gundecks was an even more demanding proposition, as the lower tier of gunports had to be uncomfortably close to the water, and there was an unavoidably large amount of weight being carried above the waterline. One of the solutions which became common was graduated armament, in which the guns of the upper decks were progressively lighter. Such an armament, with 24-pounders on the lower gundeck and 12-pounders on the upper gundeck, was considered for ''Vasa'' in 1627, but eventually the armament plan reverted to the king's original desire of 24-pounders on both decks. ''Vasa''{{'}}s sister ship, ''Äpplet'', had her upper gundeck 24-pounders changed for 12-pounders early in her career, probably in attempt to improve her stability.

''Vasa'' might not have sunk on 10 August 1628, if the ship had been sailed with the gunports closed. Ships with multiple tiers of gunports normally had to sail with the lowest tier closed, since the pressure of wind in the sails would usually push the hull over until the lower gunport sills were under water. For this reason, the gunport lids are made with a double lip which is designed to seal well enough to keep out most of the water. Captain Söfring Hansson had ordered the lower gundeck ports closed once the ship began to take on water, but by then it was too late. If he had done it before he sailed, ''Vasa'' might not have sunk on that day.&lt;ref name="Hocker (2011) 135-137"/&gt;

== Conservation ==
[[Image:Vasa 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|''Vasa'' during the early stages of conservation at the Wasa Shipyard.]]
Although ''Vasa'' was in surprisingly good condition after 333 years at the bottom of the sea, it would have quickly deteriorated if the hull had been simply allowed to dry. The large bulk of ''Vasa'', over 600 cubic metres (21,000 cu ft) of oak timber, constituted an unprecedented conservation problem. After some debate on how to best preserve the ship, conservation was carried out by impregnation with [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG), a method that has since become the standard treatment for large, waterlogged wooden objects, such as the 16th-century English ship ''[[Mary Rose]]''. ''Vasa'' was sprayed with PEG for 17 years, followed by a long period of slow drying, which is not yet entirely complete.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker (2011), pp. 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason that ''Vasa'' was so well-preserved was not just that the [[shipworm]] that normally devours wooden ships was absent but also that the water of [[Stockholms ström]] was heavily polluted until the late 20th century. The highly toxic and hostile environment meant that even the toughest microorganisms that break down wood had difficulty surviving. This, along with the fact that ''Vasa'' had been newly built and was undamaged when she sank, contributed to her conservation. Unfortunately, the properties of the water also had a negative effect. Chemicals present in the water around ''Vasa'' had penetrated the wood, and the timber was full of the corrosion products from the bolts and other iron objects which had disappeared. Once the ship was exposed to the air, reactions began inside the timber that produced acidic compounds. In the late 1990s, spots of white and yellow residue were noticed on ''Vasa'' and some of the associated artefacts. These turned out to be [[sulfate]]-containing salts that had formed on the surface of the wood when [[sulfides]] reacted with atmospheric oxygen. The salts on the surface of ''Vasa'' and objects found in and around it are not a threat themselves (even if the discolouring may be distracting), but if they are from inside the wood, they may expand and crack the timber from inside. As of 2002, the amount of sulfuric acid in ''Vasa'''s hull was estimated to be more than 2 tonnes, and more is continually being created. Enough sulfides are present in the ship to produce another 5,000 kilograms (11,000&amp;nbsp;lb) of acid at a rate of about 100 kilograms (220&amp;nbsp;lb) per year; this might eventually destroy the ship almost entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Dal &amp; Hall Roth (2002), pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

While most of the scientific community considers that the destructive substance responsible for ''Vasa'''s long-term decay is sulfuric acid, Ulla Westermark, professor of wood technology at [[Luleå University of Technology]], has proposed another mechanism with her colleague Börje Stenberg. Experiments done by Japanese researchers show that treating wood with [[Polyethylene glycol|PEG]] in an acidic environment can generate [[formic acid]] and eventually liquify the wood. ''Vasa'' was exposed to acidic water for more than three centuries, and therefore has a relatively low pH. Samples taken from the ship indicate that formic acid is present, and that it could be one of the multiple causes of a suddenly accelerated rate of decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{sv}} [[Gothenburg University]] TV, ''[http://gupea.ub.gu.se:8080/dspace/handle/2077/6331?mode=full Vetenskapslandet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430060203/http://gupea.ub.gu.se:8080/dspace/handle/2077/6331?mode=full |date=30 April 2009 }}''.

[[Image:Vasa above bow1.jpg|thumb|The preserved ''Vasa'' in the main hall of [[Vasa Museum]] seen from above the bow.]]
The museum is constantly monitoring the ship for damage caused by decay or warping of the wood. Ongoing research seeks the best way to preserve the ship for future generations and to analyze the existing material as closely as possible. A current problem is that the old [[oak]] of which the ship is built has lost a substantial amount of its original strength and the cradle that supports the ship does not match up very well with the distribution of weight and stress in the hull. 'The amount of movement in the hull is worrying. If nothing is done, the ship will most likely capsize again', states Magnus Olofson from the ''Vasa'' Museum. An effort to secure ''Vasa'' for the future is under way, in cooperation with the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] and other institutions around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{sv icon}} Dahlquist, Hans.

To deal with the problem of the inevitable deterioration of the ship, the main hall of the ''Vasa'' Museum is kept at a temperature of {{convert|18|–|20|C|F}} and a humidity level of 53%. To slow the destruction by acidic compounds, different methods have been tried. Small objects have been sealed in plastic containers filled with an inert atmosphere of [[nitrogen]] gas, for halting further reactions between sulfides and oxygen. The ship itself has been treated with cloth saturated in a [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] liquid to neutralise the low pH, but this is only a temporary solution as acid is continuously produced. The original bolts rusted away after the ship sank but were replaced with modern ones that were [[galvanization|galvanised]] and covered with [[epoxy]] resin. Despite this, the newer bolts also started to rust and were releasing iron into the wood, which accelerated the deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;Dal &amp; Hall Roth, pp. 39–41; Sandstrom, M., Jalilehvand, F., Persson, I., Gelius, U., Frank, P., Hall Roth, I.

== Legacy ==
''Vasa'' has become a popular and widely recognised symbol for a historical narrative about the Swedish ''stormaktstiden'' ('the Great Power-period') in the 17th century, and about the early development of a European [[nation state]]. Within the disciplines of history and [[maritime archaeology]] the wrecks of large warships from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries have received particularly widespread attention as perceived symbols of a past greatness of the state of Sweden. Among these wrecks, ''Vasa'' is the single best known example, and has also become recognised internationally, not least through a deliberate use of the ship as a symbol for marketing Sweden abroad. The name ''Vasa'' has in Sweden become synonymous with sunken vessels that are considered to be of great historical importance, and these are usually described, explained and valued in relation to ''Vasa'' itself.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund (1997), s. 38&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish maritime archaeologist Carl-Olof Cederlund, who has been active in the various ''Vasa''-projects, has described the phenomenon as ''regalskepps-syndromet'', 'the royal ship syndrome' (after the term used in the 17th century for the largest warships in the Swedish navy). He associates the 'syndrome' to a nationalist aspect of the [[history of ideas]] and traditional perceptions about hero-kings and glory through war. The focus of this historical theory lies on the 'great periods' in 'our [Swedish] history' and shares many similarities with the nationalist views of the [[Viking era]] in the Nordic countries and the praising of Greek and Roman [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]] in the Western world in general.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund (1997), s. 38–40&lt;/ref&gt; Cederlund has stressed the ritualised aspects of the widely publicised salvage in 1961 and has compared the modern Vasa Museum with 'a temple in the Classical sense of the word'. The placement of the museum on Djurgården, traditional crown property, and its focus on 'the King's ship' has led him to suggest a description of it as 'The Temple of the Royal Ship'.&lt;ref&gt;Cederlund (1997), s. 15; original quotes: "''ett tempel i klassisk bemärkelse''"; "''Det Kungliga Skeppets Tempel''".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature and popular culture ===
[[Image:Vasa merchandise.jpg|thumb|Merchandise and books based on ''Vasa'' on sale at the Vasa Museum gift shop.]]
''Vasa'' has been the subject of hundreds of books, articles and papers on topics ranging from marine archaeology to culinary history. Three children's books about ''Vasa'' have been written in Swedish and later translated into English, German, Danish, and Norwegian: ''The Vasa Saga'' by [[Bertil Almqvist]], ''The Vasa Sets Sail'' by Mats Wahl (illustrated by [[Sven Nordqvist]]), and ''The Vasa Piglet'' by Björn Bergenholtz.

''Vasa's'' unique status has drawn considerable attention and captured the imagination of more than two generations of scholars, tourists, model builders, and authors. Though historically unfounded, the popular perception of the building of the ship as a botched and disorganised affair (dubbed 'the [[Vasa syndrome|''Vasa''-syndrome]]') has been used by many authors of management literature as an educational example of how not to organise a successful business.&lt;ref&gt;For example this article from [[IEEE]] computing: Richard E. Fairley, Mary Jane Willshire, "Why the Vasa Sank: 10 Problems and Some Antidotes for Software Projects," ''[[IEEE Software]]'' vol. 20, no. 2, pp. 18–25, March/April 2003; see also Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Tender Ship'', [[Manhattan Project]] engineer [[Arthur Squires]] used the ''Vasa'' story as an opening illustration of his thesis that governments are usually incompetent managers of technology projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tender Ship: Governmental Management of Technological Change|last=Squires|first=Arthur M. |publisher=Birkhäuser|year=1986|location=Boston|pages=1-3 |isbn=081763312X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vasa on Lake Ashi.jpg|thumb|The Japanese sightseeing ship on [[Lake Ashi]] inspired by ''Vasa''.]]
The Vasa Museum has co-sponsored two versions of a documentary about the history and recovery of the ship, both by documentary filmmaker [[Anders Wahlgren]]. The second version is currently shown in the museum and has been released on VHS and DVD with narration in 16 languages. In late 2011, a third ''Vasa''-film premiered on Swedish television, with a longer running time and a considerably larger budget (with over 7.5&amp;nbsp;million kronor provided by [[Sveriges Television|SVT]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hellekant, Johan, "[http://www.svd.se/kultur/historisk-film-kampar-i-motvind_6309568.svd Historisk film kämpar i motvind]" ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'', 10 July 2011; Linder, Lars, "[http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/filmrecensioner/vasa-1628 Vasa 1628]" ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'', 27 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; An educational computer game, now in its second generation, has been made and is used in the museum and on its website to explain the fundamentals of 17th century ship construction and stability. Several mass-produced model kits and countless custom-built models of the ship have been made. In 1991, a 308-tonne [[pastiche]] reproduction of the ship was built in Tokyo to serve as a 650-passenger sightseeing ship. ''Vasa'' has inspired many works of art, including a gilded Disney-themed parody of the [[pilaster]] sculptures on the ship's quarter galleries.&lt;ref&gt;''Modellen: Vasamodeller från när och fjärran''.&lt;/ref&gt; Being a popular tourist attraction, ''Vasa'' is used as a motif for various souvenir products such as T-shirts, mugs, refrigerator magnets, and posters. Commercially produced replicas—such as drinking glasses, plates, spoons, and even a [[backgammon]] game—have been made from many of the objects belonging to the crew or officers found on the ship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vasamuseet.se/InEnglish/Visit/museumshop/repliker.aspx Vasa Museum homepage].

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}
"'''''Wissenschaft des Judentums'''''" ("Jewish Studies" or "Judaic Studies" in [[German language|German]]; also "Science of Judaism") refers to a nineteenth-century movement premised on the critical investigation of [[Jew]]ish literature and culture, including [[rabbinic literature]], using scientific methods to analyze the origins of Jewish traditions.

==The ''Verein für Kultur und Wissenschaft der Juden''==
The  first organized attempt at developing and disseminating ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' was the ''Verein für Kultur und Wissenschaft der Juden'' (''Society for the Culture and Science of the Jews''), founded around 1819 by [[Eduard Gans]], (a pupil of [[Hegel]]), and his associates . Other members included [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Leopold Zunz]], [[Moses Moser]], and [[Michael Beer (poet)|Michael Beer]], (youngest brother of [[Meyerbeer]]). It was an attempt to provide a construct for the Jews as a ''Volk'' or people in their own right, independent of their religious traditions. As such it sought to validate their secular cultural traditions as being on an equal footing with those adduced by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and his followers for the [[German people]]. [[Immanuel Wolf]]’s  influential essay ''Über den Begriff einer Wissenschaft des Judentums'' (On the Concept of a Science of Judaism) of 1822,  has such ideas in mind. The failure of the Verein, attributable largely to the far greater attraction, amongst German Jews, of identification with German culture, was followed, significantly, by the conversion to [[Christianity]] of many of its leading figures, including Gans and Heine.

==The ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' movement==
[[File:Die wissenschaft des Judentums.jpg|150px|thumb|left|First edition from 1822]]Despite the lack of success of the ''Verein für Kultur und Wissenschaft der Juden'', its principles inspired many Jewish thinkers to invest their efforts in a wider ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' movement, and also provoked a conservative reaction (see [[Wissenschaft des Judentums#Opposition|Opposition]]).  The historian [[Amos Elon]], in his book ''The Pity of it All'', places the movement in the context of anti-Semitic riots in Germany in 1819. The purpose, Elon writes, "was to bring ordinary Jews into the orbit of German ''[[Kultur]]'' and at the same time reinforce their Jewish identity by bridging the gulf between secular and religious education"; the movement sought to explore Judaism as "both secular civilization and religion", and thereby "help young Jews to remain Jews", even as they moved to a more secular view.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elon|2003|p=110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Dr. [[Henry Abramson]], the primary aim of the proponents of the movement was to articulate a modality of Jewish identity that was consonant with nineteenth century values, and where Jews had to demonstrate that they were patriotic members of their own societies, and at the same time express their Judaism proudly.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Henry Abramson, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6zvpUK7Gi8 Who Was Philo Judaeus of Alexandria?], minutes: 49:41–50:19, speaking on the ''Wissenschaft des Judentums''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goals===
Proponents of ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' attempted to place Jewish culture on par with [[Western culture|Western European culture]], as evinced in [[Goethe]]'s ideas of [[Bildung]], and endeavored to have "[[Jewish Studies]]" introduced into the university curriculum as a respectable area of study, freeing the field from the prevailing bias that regarded Judaism as an inferior precursor to Christianity and studied it as such.  They also developed and advocated a style of scholarship which allowed complete freedom in the interpretation of traditional texts, and which might be pursued without concerns about the practical ramifications such interpretations might have for religious observance and religious life {{Harv|Glatzer|1964}}.

[[Leopold Zunz]] (1794&amp;ndash;1886), one of the movement's leading figures, devoted much of his work to rabbinic literature. At the time, [[Christianity|Christian]] thinkers maintained that the Jews' contribution ended with the [[Bible]], and Zunz began to publish in the area of post-biblical [[rabbinic literature]]. His essays "Etwas über die rabbinische Literatur" and "Zur Geschichte und Literatur" addressed this issue. His biography of [[Rashi]] of [[Troyes]] was pivotal. When the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] government forbade preaching sermons in German synagogues, on the grounds that the [[sermon]] was an exclusively Christian institution, Zunz wrote ''History of the Jewish Sermon'' in 1832. This work has been described as "the most important Jewish book published in the 19th century."  It lays down principles for the investigation of the Rabbinic exegesis ([[Midrash]]) and of the [[siddur]] (prayer-book of the synagogue).

===Attitude toward religion===
Despite the outstanding scholarship of ''Wissenschaft'' personalities such as Zunz and [[Heinrich Graetz]] (most of whom pursued their scholarly labors on their own time as ''Privatgelehrte''), the ''Wissenschaft'' movement as a whole had a tendency to present Judaism as an historical relic &lt;ref&gt;Mendes-Flohr1998 {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with frequently apologetic overtones,&lt;ref&gt;Meyer 2004 {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often ignored matters of contemporary relevance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Zunz felt obliged to assume that Judaism had come to an end, and that it was the task of ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' to provide a judicious accounting of the varied and rich contributions which Judaism had made to civilization.  In a similar spirit, Steinschneider is said to have once quipped that ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' seeks to ensure that Judaism will receive a proper burial, in which scholarship amounts to an extended obituary properly eulogizing the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mendes-Flohr|1998|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, throughout most of its existence and despite certain of its most prominent practitioners, such as [[Moritz Steinschneider]], being  vocal opponents of religion, ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' was very much a religious movement—pursued largely by rabbis at Jewish seminaries who were engaged in preparing their students for rabbinical careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyer|2004|pp=105–106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a foreshadowing of the reform movement, Zunz often led services, which were accompanied by an organ, in the vernacular German, rather than Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elon|2003|p=112}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wissenschaft''  scholars such as Rabbi [[Zecharias Frankel|Zacharias Frankel]], the first head of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]], and his colleague at the seminary, historian Heinrich Graetz, considered Jewish history to be reflective of a divine revelation and guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyer|2004|p=106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wissenschaft des Judentums was not restricted to progressive Judaism. In 1873, Israel Hildesheimer founded the neo-orthodox modern Rabbinerseminar in Berlin.  One of its most prominent scholars, [[David Zvi Hoffmann|David Hoffmann]], defended a literal reading of the Biblical ''word'' which he understood to be the exact product of divine revelation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} It was this essentially religious nature of ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'' that made it even more dangerous in the eyes of its opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer 2004 {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christians even thought that a more liberal form of Judaism would attract converts, or would keep Jews from converting to Christianity, and so the government forced Zunz's synagogue to close.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elon|2003|p=112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attitude toward earlier scholarship===
Indeed, one detects in the writings of many Wissenschaft scholars not only an intense love of scholarship "for its own sake", but also a genuine affinity for the rabbis and scholars of old, whose works they find themselves documenting, editing, publishing, analyzing, and critiquing.  Indeed, far from disparaging or despising the Jewish religion and its many generations of rabbinical scholars, the majority of Wissenschaft practitioners are very keen to take ''ownership'' of the Jewish scholarly tradition.  They see themselves as the rightful heirs and successors to [[Saadia Gaon]] and [[Rashi]] and [[Hillel the Elder]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], and in those prior generations of scholars they see their own Wissenschaft spirit and likeness.

In the Wissenschaft approach to scholarship, then, the earlier generations of scholars become  "de-sanctified" and "re-humanized".  Wissenschaft scholars feel completely free to pass judgment on the intellectual  and scholarly capacities of earlier scholars, evaluating their originality, competence, and credibility, and pointing out their failures and limitations.  The Wissenschaft scholars, while respectful of their predecessors, have no patience for a concept such as ''[[yeridat ha-dorot]]''.  For them, the classical authorities are no more beyond dispute and critique than are contemporary scholars; the opinions of [[Abraham ibn Ezra|ibn Ezra]] and [[Steinschneider]] may be presented in the same sentence without any sense of impropriety, and either one may then be debunked with the same forwardness.  No doubt this de-sanctification of the Jewish luminaries provided further grist for the opponents of the movement.

==Legacy==
Although the  ''Wissenschaft'' movement produced a vast number of scholarly publications of lasting value, and its influence still reverberates through [[Jewish Studies]] departments (and, indeed, some [[yeshivas]]) around the world, it is possible to regard the publication of the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' in 1901–1906 as the culmination and final flowering of this era in Jewish studies {{Harv|Levy|2002}}.  The choice of [[English language|English]] over [[German language|German]] as the language for this epochal work is a further sign that an era of German scholarship was drawing to a close.  In the early years of the new century the ''Wissenschaft'' culture and style of scholarship was transplanted to a certain extent to bodies such as the  ''Institute for Jewish Studies'' at [[Hebrew University]] (e.g., [[Gershom Scholem]])  and Jewish Studies departments at American universities such as [[Brandeis University|Brandeis]] and [[Harvard]] (e.g., [[Harry Austryn Wolfson]]).

==Opposition==
The ''Wissenschaft'' movement drew criticism from traditional elements in the Jewish community, who regarded it as sterile at best, and at worst damaging to the religious community.  A key opposition leader was [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].  He and other traditional religious scholars representing urban and sophisticated Orthodox constituencies regarded the ''Wissenschaft'' movement as failing to meet the needs of the living Jewish community; Mendes-Flohr observes in this context that historians, by virtue of their craft, necessarily "transform traditional knowledge, draining it of its sacral power."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mendes-Flohr|1998|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orthodox orientation of ''Wissenschaft'' figures such as [[David Zvi Hoffmann]] did not spare them from Hirsch's condemnation.

==Guttmann and his ''Philosophie des Judentums''==
[[Julius Guttmann]] is best known for  ''Die Philosophie des Judentums'' (Reinhardt, 1933), translations of which are available in [[Hebrew]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], etc.  The English title is ''The Philosophy of Judaism: The History of Jewish Philosophy from Biblical Times to Franz Rosenzweig'' (New York, 1964).

Roth sees in this publication "the last product in the direct line of the authentic Judaeo-German 'Science of Judaism'" (more commonly known as Wissenschaft des Judentums).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roth|1999|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the movement did not utterly expire with the publication Guttman's work—its spirit living on in the work of [[G. Scholem]] and [[H.A. Wolfson]] among many others—it is certainly the case that the Wissenschaft movement in Germany had by the 1930s already ceased to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roth|1999}}.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original German edition of Philosophie des Judentums ends with [[Hermann Cohen]], the primary influence on Guttman's own philosophy, while the later Hebrew edition includes [[Franz Rosenzweig]].  It is also notable that Guttman's work excludes major thinkers of the [[Kabbalistic]] school, which reflects his own attitude toward [[Jewish philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Werblowsky|1964|p=ix}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16353">'''Words per minute''', commonly abbreviated '''wpm''' (sometimes uppercased '''WPM'''), is a measure of [[word]]s processed in a minute, often used as a measurement of the speed of typing, [[reading speed|reading]] or Morse code sending and receiving.

== Alphanumeric entry ==

Since the length or duration of words is clearly variable, for the purpose of measurement of text entry, the definition of each "word" is often standardized to be five characters or [[keystroke]]s long in English,&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Sabbir Arif and Wolfgang Stuerzlinger. 2009.[http://www.asarif.com/pub/papers/Arif_TICSTH09.pdf Analysis of Text Entry Performance Metrics]. In ''Proceedings of the IEEE Toronto International Conference–Science and Technology for Humanity'' (TIC-STH '09). IEEE, Washington, DC, US, 100-105.&lt;/ref&gt; including spaces and punctuation. For example, under such a method applied to plain English text the phrase "I run" counts as one word, but "rhinoceros" and "let's talk" would both count as two.

Brandon Raziano found that one study of average [[computer user]]s in 1997, the average rate for transcription was 33 words per minute, and 19 words per minute for composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |vauthors=Karat CM, Halverson C, Horn D, Karat J |year=1999 |title=Patterns of entry and correction in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems |booktitle=Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '99) |publisher=ACM |location=New York, NY, US |pages=568–575 |doi=10.1145/302979.303160 |url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/302979.303160 |isbn=0-201-48559-1 |accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same study, when the group was divided into "fast", "moderate", and "slow" groups, the average speeds were 40 wpm, 35 wpm, and 23 wpm, respectively.&lt;ref name="Brown1988"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Brown |first=CM |year=1988 |title=Human-computer interface design guidelines |location=Norwood, NJ |publisher=Ablex Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the onset of the era of desktop computers, fast typing skills became much more widespread.

An average professional [[Copy typist|typist]] types usually in speeds of 50 to 80 wpm, while some positions can require 80 to 95 (usually the minimum required for dispatch positions and other time-sensitive typing jobs), and some advanced typists work at speeds above 120 wpm.&lt;ref name="Ayres&amp;Martinás2005"&gt;{{citation |year=2005 |author=Ayres, Robert U |authorlink=Robert Ayres (scientist) |author2=Martinás, Katalin |chapter=120 wpm for very skilled typist |page=41 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ksxK7J95IF8C&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=typists+%22120+words+per+minute%22#v=onepage&amp;q=typists%20%22120%20words%20per%20minute%22&amp;f=false |title=On the Reappraisal of Microeconomics: Economic Growth and Change in a Material World |place=Cheltenham, UK &amp; Northampton, Massachusetts |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=1-84542-272-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ksxK7J95IF8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=reappraisal+microeconomics#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two-finger typists, sometimes also referred to as "[[hunt and peck]]" typists, commonly reach sustained speeds of about 37 wpm for memorized text and 27 wpm when copying text, but in bursts may be able to reach much higher speeds.&lt;ref name="Brown1988"/&gt; From the 1920s through the 1970s, typing speed (along with shorthand speed) was an important secretarial qualification and typing contests were popular and often publicized by typewriter companies as promotional tools.

== Stenotype ==
{{Main article|Stenotype}}

Stenotype keyboards enable the trained user to input text as fast as 225 wpm or faster at very high accuracy for an extended period of time, which is sufficient for real-time activities such as court reporting or closed captioning. While dropout rates are very high—in some cases, only 10%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american-school-search.com/review/stenotype-institute-of-jacksonville |title=Stenotype Institute of Jacksonville Jacksonville - Review &amp; Ranking |publisher=American-school-search.com |date=2014-04-13 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even less graduate—stenotype students are usually able to reach speeds of 100–120 wpm within six months, which is faster than most alphanumeric typists. Guinness World Records&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/fastest-realtime-court-reporter-%28stenotype-writing%29/ |title=Fastest realtime court reporter (stenotype writing) |publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com |date=2004-07-30 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives 360 wpm with 97.23% accuracy as the highest achieved speed using a stenotype.

== Numeric entry ==

The numeric entry or 10 key speed is a measure of one's ability to manipulate the [[numeric keypad]] found on most modern separate computer keyboards. It is used to measure speed for jobs such as [[Data entry clerk|data entry]] of number information on items such as [[remittance advice]], bills, or checks, as deposited to [[lockbox]]es. It is measured in "Keystrokes per hour," or KPH. Many jobs require a certain KPH, often 8,000 or 10,000.

== Handwriting ==
&lt;!-- The average human being [[Penmanship|hand-writes]] at 31 words per minute for [[memory|memorized]] text and 19 words per minute while copying.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Brown, C. M. (1988). Human-computer interface design guidelines. Norwood, NJ: Ablex Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2016}}--&gt;

For an adult population (age range 18–64) the average speed of copying is 68 letters per minute (approximately 13 wpm), with the range from a minimum of 26 to a maximum of 113 letters per minute (approximately 5 to 20 wpm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bledsoe Jr.|first1=Dave|title=Handwriting Speed in an Adult Population|journal=Advance for Occupational Therapy Practitioners|date=2011|volume=27|issue=22|pages=10|url=http://occupational-therapy.advanceweb.com/Archives/Article-Archives/Handwriting-Speed-in-an-Adult-Population.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of police interview records showed that the highest speed fell in the range 120–155 characters per minute, the highest possible limit being 190 characters per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardcastle|first1=R. A.|last2=Matthews|first2=C. J.|title=Speed of writing|journal=Journal of the Forensic Science Society|date=January 1991|volume=31|issue=1|pages=21–29|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015736891731149|doi=10.1016/s0015-7368(91)73114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to various studies the speed of handwriting of 3–7 graders varies from 25 to 94 letters per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zaviani|first1=Jenny|last2=Wallen|first2=Margaret|editor1-last=Henderson|editor1-first=Anne|editor2-last=Pehoski|editor2-first=Charlane|title=Hand Function in the Child: Foundations for Remediation|date=2006|publisher=Mosby|location=St. Louis, MO|page=228|edition=2nd|chapter=The Development of Graphomotor Skills|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2g51sanc4AMC&amp;pg=PA228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[stenography]] (shorthand) methods, this rate increases greatly. Handwriting speeds up to 350 words per minute have been achieved in shorthand competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/12/30/102911691.pdf |title=New World'S Record For Shorthand Speed |publisher=New York Times |date=1922-12-30 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reading and comprehension ==
Words per minute is a common metric for assessing [[reading (activity)|reading]] speed and is often used in the context of remedial skills evaluation, as well as in the context of [[speed reading]], where it is a controversial measure of reading performance.

A word in this context is the same as in the context of speech&lt;!--, above--&gt;.

Research done in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trauzettel-Klosinski|first1=Susanne|last2=Dietz|first2=Klaus|title=Standardized Assessment of Reading Performance: The New International Reading Speed Texts IReST|journal=Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science|date=August 2012|volume=53|issue=9|url=http://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2166061}}&lt;/ref&gt; measured the speed at which subjects read a text aloud, and found the average speed across 17 different languages to be 184±29 wpm or 863±234 characters per minute. However, for the languages that use the Latin or [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] alphabets, the number of wpm varied, as low as 161±18 for [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and as high as 228±30 for English. The reason for this is different word structures in each language (longer words in such languages as Finnish and shorter words in English). However, the number of characters per minute tends to be around 1000 for all the tested languages. For the tested Asian languages that use particular writing systems (Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese) these numbers are lower.

Scientific studies have demonstrated that reading—defined here as capturing and decoding all the words on every page—faster than 900 wpm is not feasible given the limits set by the anatomy of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0-9934964-0-0|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cEFKjwEACAAJ&amp;dq=ultimate+study+method&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[proofreading]] materials, people are able to read English at 200 wpm on paper, and 180 wpm on a monitor.&lt;ref name=Ziefle98&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ziefle|first1=M|title=Effects of display resolution on visual performance.|journal=Human factors|date=December 1998|volume=40|issue=4|pages=554–68|pmid=9974229|doi=10.1518/001872098779649355}}&lt;/ref&gt; [Those numbers from Ziefle, 1998, are for studies that used monitors prior to 1992. See Noyes &amp; Garland 2008 for a modern tech view of equivalence.]

== Speech and listening ==

[[Audiobook]]s are recommended to be 150–160 words per minute, which is the range that people comfortably hear and vocalize words.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J. R. (1998). Guidelines for the use of multimedia in instruction, Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 42nd Annual Meeting, 1447–1451&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slideshow|Slide presentations]] tend to be closer to 100–125 wpm for a comfortable pace,&lt;ref name=wong&gt;{{cite book|last=Wong|first=Linda|title=Essential Study Skills|date=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1285965620|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yL2iAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA348&amp;dq=conversation+words+per+minute&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U6waU7ulFMbokQfiwYCoAg&amp;ved=0CDkQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=conversation%20words%20per%20minute&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[auctioneer]]s can speak at about 250 wpm,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} and the fastest speaking [[Policy debate#Speed|policy debaters]] speak from 350&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/19/magazine/319debate.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Ministers of Debate | first=Zev | last=Chafets | date=2006-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to over 500 words per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9Jld9a4olgC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=540+words+per+minute |title=Falwell Inc.: Inside a Religious, Political, Educational, and Business Empire - Dirk Smillie - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet speech calculators show that various things influence words per minute including nervousness.{{Citation needed|reason=More information required to make this assertion|date=May 2014}}

[[John Moschitta, Jr.]], was listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', for a time, as the world's fastest speaker, being able to talk at 586 wpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyhistory.com/events/1988/may_24_1988_161209.html |title=John Moschitta set record for fast talking...

[[Morse code]] uses variable length sequences of short and long duration ''signals'' (dots and dashes) to represent source information&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Telecommunication Union|first1=ITU|title=International Morse Code Recommendation|url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/m/R-REC-M.1677-1-200910-I!!PDF-E.pdf|publisher=ITU}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. sequences for the letter "K" and numeral "2" are respectively ({{morse|dash|dot|dash}}) and ({{morse|dot|dot|dash|dash|dash}}). This variability complicates the measurement of Morse code speed rated in words per minute. Using telegram messages, the average English word length is about five characters, each averaging 5.124 dot durations or baud. Spacing between words should also be considered, being seven dot durations in the USA and five in British territories. So the average British telegraph word was 30.67 dot times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morsh|first1=Joseph E.|last2=Stannard|first2=A. F. B.|title=Studies in international Morse Code. II. A simplified method of determining code speed.|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology Revue Canadienne de Psychologie|date=1947|volume=1|issue=2|pages=67–70|doi=10.1037/h0084027}}&lt;/ref&gt; So the baud rate of a Morse code is {{frac|50|60}} × word per minute rate.

It is standard practice to use two different such ''standard words'' to measure Morse code speeds in words per minute. The standard words are: "PARIS" and "CODEX". In Morse code "PARIS" has 50 dot durations, while "CODEX" has 60.

Morse is still widely used by [[amateur radio]] operators (hams).  Experienced hams routinely send Morse at 20 words per minute, using manually operated hand [[telegraph key]]s; enthusiasts such as members of [[The CW Operators' Club]] routinely send and receive Morse code at speeds up to 60 wpm. Twenty words per minute (20 wpm) represents the rough upper limit for Morse operators attempting to write down Morse code received by ear using paper and pencil.  Many skilled Morse code operators can receive Morse code by ear mentally without writing down the information at speeds up to 70 wpm.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} To write down the Morse code information manually at speeds higher than 20 wpm it is usual for the operators to use a typewriter or computer keyboard to enable higher speed copying.

The fastest Morse code operator was [[Theodore Roosevelt McElroy]] copying at 75.6 wpm using a typewriter at the 1939 world championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerwendell.com/morsecode.html |title=Morse code page of Roger J.

The '''Y chromosome''' is one of two sex [[chromosome]]s ([[allosome]]s) in [[mammal]]s, including [[human]]s, and many other animals. The other is the [[X chromosome]]. Y is the [[Sex-determination system|sex-determining]] chromosome in many [[species]], since it is the presence or absence of Y that determines the male or female [[sex]] of [[offspring]] produced in [[sexual reproduction]]. In mammals, the Y chromosome contains the [[gene]] [[SRY]], which triggers [[testis]] development. The [[DNA]] in the human Y chromosome is composed of about 59 million [[base pairs]].&lt;ref name="Chromosome Y"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/mapview?chr=Y |title = Ensembl Human MapView release 43 |date = February 2014 |accessdate = 2007-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Y chromosome is passed only from father to son. With a 30% difference between humans and chimpanzees, the Y chromosome is one of the fastest-evolving parts of the [[human genome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wade|first=Nicholas|title=Male Chromosome May Evolve Fastest|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/science/14gene.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, over 200 Y-linked genes have been identified.&lt;ref name="National Center for Biotechnology Information"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Genes and Disease| publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information| location = Bethesda, Maryland|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22266/#A296}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Y-linked genes are expressed and (apart from duplicated genes) [[hemizygous]] (present on only one chromosome) except in the cases of [[aneuploidy]] such as [[XYY syndrome]] or [[XXYY syndrome]]. 

== Overview ==

===Discovery===
The Y chromosome was identified as a sex-determining chromosome by [[Nettie Stevens]] at [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1905 during a study of the [[mealworm]] ''Tenebrio molitor''. [[Edmund Beecher Wilson]] independently discovered the same mechanisms the same year. Stevens proposed that chromosomes always existed in pairs and that the Y chromosome was the pair of the X chromosome discovered in 1890 by [[Hermann Henking]]. She realized that the previous idea of [[Clarence Erwin McClung]], that the X chromosome determines sex, was wrong and that [[Sex-determination system|sex determination]] is, in fact, due to the presence or absence of the Y chromosome. Stevens named the chromosome "Y" simply to follow on from Henking's "X" alphabetically.&lt;ref&gt;David Bainbridge, 'The X in Sex: How the X Chromosome Controls Our Lives'', pages 3-5, 13, [[Harvard University Press]], 2003 {{ISBN|0674016211}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Schwartz, ''In Pursuit of the Gene: From Darwin to DNA'', pages 170-172, [[Harvard University Press]], 2009 {{ISBN|0674034910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that the Y chromosome was named after its similarity in appearance to the letter "Y" is mistaken.  All chromosomes normally appear as an amorphous blob under the microscope and only take on a well-defined shape during [[mitosis]]. This shape is vaguely X-shaped for all chromosomes.  It is entirely coincidental that the Y chromosome, during [[mitosis]], has two very short branches which can look merged under the microscope and appear as the descender of a Y-shape.&lt;ref&gt;Bainbridge, pages 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variations===
{{See also|Androgen insensitivity syndrome|Intersex}}
Most mammals have only one pair of sex chromosomes in each cell. Males have one Y chromosome and one [[X chromosome]], while females have two X chromosomes. In mammals, the Y chromosome contains a gene, [[SRY]], which triggers embryonic development as a male. The Y chromosomes of humans and other mammals also contain other genes needed for normal sperm production.

There are exceptions, however. For example, the [[platypus]] relies on an [[XY sex-determination system]] based on five pairs of chromosomes.&lt;ref name="Grützner"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grützner F, Rens W, Tsend-Ayush E |title=In the platypus a meiotic chain of ten sex chromosomes shares genes with the bird Z and mammal X chromosomes |journal=Nature |volume=432 |pages=913–9177 |year=2004 |doi=10.1038/nature03021 |url= |pmid=15502814 |issue=7019 |displayauthors=etal  |bibcode=2004Natur.432..913G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Platypus sex chromosomes have strong sequence similarity with the avian [[ZW sex-determination system|Z chromosome]], (indicating close [[Sequence homology|homology]]),&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Warren WC, Hillier LD, Graves JA |title=Genome analysis of the platypus reveals unique signatures of evolution |journal=Nature |volume=453 |pages=175–183 |year=2008 |doi=10.1038/nature06936 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7192/full/nature06936.html |pmid=18464734 |issue=7192 |pmc=2803040 |displayauthors=etal  |bibcode=2008Natur.453..175W }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the SRY gene so central to sex-determination in most other mammals is apparently not involved in platypus sex-determination.&lt;ref name="Veyrunes"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Veyrunes F, Waters PD, Miethke P |title=Bird-like sex chromosomes of platypus imply recent origin of mammal sex chromosomes |journal=Genome Research |volume=18 |pages=965–973 |year=2008 |doi=10.1101/gr.7101908 |url=http://genome.cshlp.org/content/18/6/965.abstract |pmid=18463302 |issue=6 |pmc=2413164 |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among humans, some men have two Xs and a Y ("XXY", see [[Klinefelter syndrome]]), or one X and two Ys (see [[XYY syndrome]]), and [[triple X syndrome|some women have three Xs]] or a single X instead of a double X ("X0", see [[Turner syndrome]]).  There are other exceptions in which [[SRY]] is damaged (leading to an [[Swyer syndrome|XY female]]), or copied to the X (leading to an [[XX male]]). 

== Origins and evolution ==

===Before Y chromosome===
Many [[ectotherm]]ic [[vertebrates]] have no sex chromosomes.  If they have different sexes, sex is determined environmentally rather than genetically.  For some of them, especially [[reptile]]s, sex depends on the incubation temperature; others are [[hermaphrodite#Simultaneous hermaphrodites|hermaphroditic]] (meaning they contain both male and female gametes in the same individual).

===Origin===
The X and Y chromosomes are thought to have evolved from a pair of identical chromosomes,&lt;ref name="muller"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Muller, H. J. |title=A gene for the fourth chromosome of Drosophila |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=325–336 |year=1914 |doi=10.1002/jez.1400170303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lahn"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lahn B, Page D |title=Four evolutionary strata on the human X chromosome |journal=Science |volume=286 |issue=5441 |pages=964–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10542153 |doi=10.1126/science.286.5441.964}}&lt;!--http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s63100.htm [replaced]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; termed [[autosome]]s, when an ancestral animal developed an allelic variation, a so-called "sex locus" – simply possessing this [[allele]] caused the organism to be male.&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006" /&gt; The chromosome with this allele became the Y chromosome, while the other member of the pair became the X chromosome. Over time, genes that were beneficial for males and harmful to (or had no effect on) females either developed on the Y chromosome or were acquired through the process of [[chromosomal translocation|translocation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Graves J. A. M. |author2=Koina E. |author3=Sankovic N. |title=How the gene content of human sex chromosomes evolved |journal=Curr Opin Genet Dev |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=219–24 |year=2006 |pmid=16650758 |doi=10.1016/j.gde.2006.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, the X and Y chromosomes were thought to have diverged around 300 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|pmc=4120474|title=Y chromosome evolution: emerging insights into processes of Y chromosome degeneration}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research published in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2010/01/human_male_still_a_work_in_pro.html |title=Human Male: Still A Work in Progress |work=NPR |date=January 13, 2010 |first=Jon |last=Hamilton }}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly research published in 2008 documenting the sequencing of the platypus genome,&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt; has suggested that the XY sex-determination system would not have been present more than 166 million years ago, at the split of the [[monotreme]]s from other mammals.&lt;ref name="Veyrunes" /&gt; This re-estimation of the age of the [[theria]]n XY system is based on the finding that sequences that are on the X chromosomes of marsupials and [[eutherian]] mammals are present on the autosomes of [[platypus]] and birds.&lt;ref name="Veyrunes" /&gt; The older estimate was based on erroneous reports that the platypus X chromosomes contained these sequences.&lt;ref name="Grützner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Watson |first=Jaclyn M. |first2=Arthur |last2=Riggs |first3=Jennifer A. Marshall |last3=Graves |title=Gene mapping studies confirm the homology between the platypus X and echidna X1 chromosomes and identify a conserved ancestral monotreme X chromosome |year=1992 |journal=Chromosoma |volume=101 |issue=10 |pages=596–601 |doi=10.1007/BF00360536 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recombination inhibition===
[[Genetic recombination|Recombination]] between the X and Y chromosomes proved harmful—it resulted in males without necessary genes formerly found on the Y chromosome, and females with unnecessary or even harmful genes previously only found on the Y chromosome.  As a result, genes beneficial to males accumulated near the sex-determining genes, and recombination in this region was suppressed in order to preserve this male specific region.&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006" /&gt; Over time, the Y chromosome changed in such a way as to inhibit the areas around the sex determining genes from recombining at all with the X chromosome. As a result of this process, 95% of the human Y chromosome is unable to recombine. Only the tips of the Y and X chromosomes recombine. The tips of the Y chromosome that could recombine with the X chromosome are referred to as the [[pseudoautosomal region]].  The rest of the Y chromosome is passed on to the next generation intact, allowing for its use in tracking human evolution.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Degeneration===
By one estimate, the human Y chromosome has lost 1,393 of its 1,438 original genes over the course of its existence, and [[Extrapolation|linear extrapolation]] of this 1,393-gene loss over 300 million years gives a rate of genetic loss of 4.6 genes per million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graves |first=J. A. M. |year=2004 |title=The degenerate Y chromosome—can conversion save it? |journal=Reproduction Fertility and Development |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=527–534 |doi=10.1071/RD03096 |pmid=15367368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Continued loss of genes at the rate of 4.6 genes per million years would result in a Y chromosome with no functional genes – that is the Y chromosome would lose complete function – within the next 10 million years, or half that time with the current age estimate of 160 million years.&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goto |first=H. |first2=L. |last2=Peng |first3=K. D. |last3=Makova |year=2009 |title=Evolution of X-degenerate Y chromosome genes in greater apes: conservation of gene content in human and gorilla, but not chimpanzee |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=134–144 |doi=10.1007/s00239-008-9189-y |pmid=19142680 |bibcode=2009JMolE..68..134G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative genomic analysis reveals that many mammalian species are experiencing a similar loss of function in their heterozygous sex chromosome. Degeneration may simply be the fate of all non-recombining sex chromosomes, due to three common evolutionary forces: high [[mutation rate]], inefficient [[Selection (biology)|selection]], and [[genetic drift]].&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graves |first=J. A. M. |year=2006 |title=Sex chromosome specialization and degeneration in mammals |journal=[[Cell (journal)|Cell]] |volume=124 |issue=5 |pages=901–914 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.02.024 |pmid=16530039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, comparisons of the human and [[chimpanzee]] Y chromosomes (first published in 2005) show that the human Y chromosome has not lost any genes since the divergence of humans and chimpanzees between 6–7 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first=Jennifer F. |year=2005 |title=Conservation of Y-linked genes during human evolution revealed by comparative sequencing in chimpanzee |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7055 |pages=100–103 |doi=10.1038/nature04101 |pmid=16136134 |display-authors=etal|bibcode=2005Natur.437..100H }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a scientific report in 2012 stated that only one gene had been lost since humans diverged from the rhesus macaque 25 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hsu|first=Christine|title=Biologists Debunk the 'Rotting' Y Chromosome Theory, Men Will Still Exist|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/news/20120222/9163/y-chromosome-chromosome-theory-men-extinct-monkey-x-chromosome-biology.htm|publisher=Medical Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These facts provide direct evidence that the linear extrapolation model is flawed and suggest that the current human Y chromosome is either no longer shrinking or is shrinking at a much slower rate than the 4.6 genes per million years estimated by the linear extrapolation model.

====High mutation rate====
The human Y chromosome is particularly exposed to high mutation rates due to the environment in which it is housed. The Y chromosome is passed exclusively through [[sperm]], which undergo multiple [[cell division]]s during [[gametogenesis]]. Each cellular division provides further opportunity to accumulate base pair mutations. Additionally, sperm are stored in the highly oxidative environment of the testis, which encourages further mutation. These two conditions combined put the Y chromosome at a greater risk of mutation than the rest of the genome.&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006"/&gt; The increased mutation risk for the Y chromosome is reported by Graves as a factor 4.8.&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006" /&gt; However, her original reference obtains this number for the relative mutation rates in male and female germ lines for the lineage leading to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lindblad-Toh K, Wade CM, Mikkelsen TS, Karlsson EK, Jaffe DB, Kamal M, Clamp M, Chang JL, Kulbokas EJ, Zody MC, Mauceli E, Xie X, Breen M, Wayne RK, Ostrander EA, Ponting CP, Galibert F, Smith DR, DeJong PJ, Kirkness E, Alvarez P, Biagi T, Brockman W, Butler J, Chin CW, Cook A, Cuff J, Daly MJ, DeCaprio D, Gnerre S, Grabherr M, Kellis M, Kleber M, Bardeleben C, Goodstadt L, Heger A, Hitte C, Kim L, Koepfli KP, Parker HG, Pollinger JP, Searle SM, Sutter NB, Thomas R, Webber C, Baldwin J, Abebe A, Abouelleil A, Aftuck L, Ait-Zahra M, Aldredge T, Allen N, An P, Anderson S, Antoine C, Arachchi H, Aslam A, Ayotte L, Bachantsang P, Barry A, Bayul T, Benamara M, Berlin A, Bessette D, Blitshteyn B, Bloom T, Blye J, Boguslavskiy L, Bonnet C, Boukhgalter B, Brown A, Cahill P, Calixte N, Camarata J, Cheshatsang Y, Chu J, Citroen M, Collymore A, Cooke P, Dawoe T, Daza R, Decktor K, DeGray S, Dhargay N, Dooley K, Dooley K, Dorje P, Dorjee K, Dorris L, Duffey N, Dupes A, Egbiremolen O, Elong R, Falk J, Farina A, Faro S, Ferguson D, Ferreira P, Fisher S, FitzGerald M, Foley K, Foley C, Franke A, Friedrich D, Gage D, Garber M, Gearin G, Giannoukos G, Goode T, Goyette A, Graham J, Grandbois E, Gyaltsen K, Hafez N, Hagopian D, Hagos B, Hall J, Healy C, Hegarty R, Honan T, Horn A, Houde N, Hughes L, Hunnicutt L, Husby M, Jester B, Jones C, Kamat A, Kanga B, Kells C, Khazanovich D, Kieu AC, Kisner P, Kumar M, Lance K, Landers T, Lara M, Lee W, Leger JP, Lennon N, Leuper L, LeVine S, Liu J, Liu X, Lokyitsang Y, Lokyitsang T, Lui A, Macdonald J, Major J, Marabella R, Maru K, Matthews C, McDonough S, Mehta T, Meldrim J, Melnikov A, Meneus L, Mihalev A, Mihova T, Miller K, Mittelman R, Mlenga V, Mulrain L, Munson G, Navidi A, Naylor J, Nguyen T, Nguyen N, Nguyen C, Nguyen T, Nicol R, Norbu N, Norbu C, Novod N, Nyima T, Olandt P, O'Neill B, O'Neill K, Osman S, Oyono L, Patti C, Perrin D, Phunkhang P, Pierre F, Priest M, Rachupka A, Raghuraman S, Rameau R, Ray V, Raymond C, Rege F, Rise C, Rogers J, Rogov P, Sahalie J, Settipalli S, Sharpe T, Shea T, Sheehan M, Sherpa N, Shi J, Shih D, Sloan J, Smith C, Sparrow T, Stalker J, Stange-Thomann N, Stavropoulos S, Stone C, Stone S, Sykes S, Tchuinga P, Tenzing P, Tesfaye S, Thoulutsang D, Thoulutsang Y, Topham K, Topping I, Tsamla T, Vassiliev H, Venkataraman V, Vo A, Wangchuk T, Wangdi T, Weiand M, Wilkinson J, Wilson A, Yadav S, Yang S, Yang X, Young G, Yu Q, Zainoun J, Zembek L, Zimmer A, Lander ES|display-authors = 6 |title=Genome sequence, comparative analysis and haplotype structure of the domestic dog |journal=Nature |volume=438 |issue=7069 |pages=803–819 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16341006 |doi=10.1038/nature04338 |bibcode=2005Natur.438..803L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inefficient selection====
Without the ability to recombine during [[meiosis]], the Y chromosome is unable to expose individual [[allele]]s to natural selection. Deleterious alleles are allowed to "hitchhike" with beneficial neighbors, thus propagating maladapted alleles in to the next generation. Conversely, advantageous alleles may be selected against if they are surrounded by harmful alleles (background selection). Due to this inability to sort through its gene content, the Y chromosome is particularly prone to the accumulation of [[Noncoding DNA|"junk" DNA]]. Massive accumulations of retrotransposable elements are scattered throughout the Y.&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006"/&gt; The random insertion of DNA segments often disrupts encoded gene sequences and renders them nonfunctional. However, the Y chromosome has no way of weeding out these "jumping genes". Without the ability to isolate alleles, selection cannot effectively act upon them.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

A clear, quantitative indication of this inefficiency is the [[entropy rate]] of the Y chromosome. Whereas all other chromosomes in the [[human genome]] have entropy rates of 1.5–1.9 bits per nucleotide (compared to the theoretical maximum of exactly 2 for no redundancy), the Y chromosome's entropy rate is only 0.84.&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Zhandong |last=Liu |first2=Santosh S. |last2=Venkatesh |first3=Carlo C. |last3=Maley |title=Sequence space coverage, entropy of genomes and the potential to detect non-human DNA in human samples |journal=BMC Genomics |year=2008 |volume=9 |issue= 1|pages=509 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-9-509 |pmid=18973670 |pmc=2628393}} Fig. 6, using the [[Lempel-Ziv]] estimators of entropy rate.&lt;/ref&gt; This means the Y chromosome has a much lower information content relative to its overall length; it is more redundant.

====Genetic drift====
Even if a well adapted Y chromosome manages to maintain genetic activity by avoiding mutation accumulation, there is no guarantee it will be passed down to the next generation. The population size of the Y chromosome is inherently limited to 1/4 that of autosomes: diploid organisms contain two copies of autosomal chromosomes while only half the population contains 1 Y chromosome. Thus, genetic drift is an exceptionally strong force acting upon the Y chromosome. Through sheer random assortment, an adult male may never pass on his Y chromosome if he only has female offspring. Thus, although a male may have a well adapted Y chromosome free of excessive mutation, it may never make it in to the next gene pool.&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006"/&gt; The repeat random loss of well-adapted Y chromosomes, coupled with the tendency of the Y chromosome to evolve to have more deleterious mutations rather than less for reasons described above, contributes to the species-wide degeneration of Y chromosomes through [[Muller's ratchet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Charlesworth |first=B. |first2=D. |last2=Charlesworth |year=2000 |title=The degeneration of Y chromosomes |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |volume=355 |issue=1403 |pages=1563–1572 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0717 |pmc=1692900 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene conversion ===
As it has been already mentioned, the Y chromosome is unable to recombine during [[meiosis]] like the other human chromosomes; however, in 2003, researchers from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] discovered a process which may slow down the process of degradation.
They found that human Y chromosome is able to "recombine" with itself, using [[palindrome]] [[base pair]] sequences.&lt;ref name="rozen"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rozen S, Skaletsky H, Marszalek J, Minx P, Cordum H, Waterston R, Wilson R, Page D |title=Abundant gene conversion between arms of palindromes in human and ape Y chromosomes |journal=Nature |volume=423 |issue=6942 |pages=873–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12815433 |doi=10.1038/nature01723|bibcode=2003Natur.423..873R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a "recombination" is called [[gene conversion]].

In the case of the Y chromosomes, the [[palindrome]]s are not [[noncoding DNA]]; these strings of bases contain functioning genes important for male fertility. Most of the sequence pairs are greater than 99.97% identical. The extensive use of gene conversion may play a role in the ability of the Y chromosome to edit out genetic mistakes and maintain the integrity of the relatively few genes it carries. In other words, since the Y chromosome is single, it has duplicates of its genes on itself instead of having a second, homologous, chromosome. When errors occur, it can use other parts of itself as a template to correct them.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Findings were confirmed by comparing similar regions of the Y chromosome in humans to the Y chromosomes of [[chimpanzee]]s, [[bonobo]]s and [[gorilla]]s. The comparison demonstrated that the same phenomenon of gene conversion appeared to be at work more than 5 million years ago, when humans and the non-human primates diverged from each other.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Future evolution ===

In the terminal stages of the degeneration of the Y chromosome, other chromosomes increasingly take over genes and functions formerly associated with it.  Finally, the Y chromosome disappears entirely, and a new sex-determining system arises.&lt;ref name="Graves, J.A.M 2006" /&gt;{{POV statement|date=September 2016}}{{synthesis inline|date=September 2016}} Several species of [[rodent]] in the sister families [[Muridae]] and [[Cricetidae]] have reached these stages,&lt;ref name="Marchal 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marchal |first=J.

Outside of the rodents, the [[Hairy-fronted muntjac|black muntjac]], ''Muntiacus crinifrons'', evolved new X and Y chromosomes through fusions of the ancestral sex chromosomes and [[autosome]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhou |first=Q. |first2=J. |last2=Wang |first3=L. |last3=Huang |first4=W.

===1:1 sex ratio===
[[Fisher's principle]] outlines why almost all species using [[sexual reproduction]] have a [[sex ratio]] of 1:1. [[W. D. Hamilton]] gave the following basic explanation in his 1967 paper on "Extraordinary sex ratios",&lt;ref name=Hamilton67&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.156.3774.477 | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W. D. | year = 1967 | title = Extraordinary sex ratios | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/refs/156/3774/477 | journal = Science | volume = 156 | issue = 3774| pages = 477–488 | pmid = 6021675 |bibcode = 1967Sci...156..477H }}&lt;/ref&gt; given the condition that males and females cost equal amounts to produce:&lt;!-- this is a better explanation than Fisher's contorted text--&gt;

:# Suppose male births are less common than female.
:# A newborn male then has better mating prospects than a newborn female, and therefore can expect to have more offspring.
:# Therefore parents genetically disposed to produce males tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them.
:# Therefore the genes for male-producing tendencies spread, and male births become more common.
:# As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, the advantage associated with producing males dies away.
:# The same reasoning holds if females are substituted for males throughout. Therefore 1:1 is the equilibrium ratio.

==Non-mammal Y chromosome==
Many groups of organisms in addition to mammals have Y chromosomes, but these Y chromosomes do not share common ancestry with mammalian Y chromosomes.  Such groups include ''[[Drosophila]]'', some other insects, some fish, some reptiles, and some plants. In ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', the Y chromosome does not trigger male development.  Instead, sex is determined by the number of X chromosomes. The ''D. melanogaster'' Y chromosome does contain genes necessary for male fertility. So XXY ''D. melanogaster'' are female, and ''D. melanogaster'' with a single X (X0), are male but sterile. There are some species of Drosophila in which X0 males are both viable and fertile.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===ZW chromosomes===
Other organisms have mirror image sex chromosomes: where the homogeneous sex is the male, said to have two Z chromosomes, and the female is the heterogeneous sex, and said to have a Z chromosome and a [[ZW sex-determination system|W chromosome]]. For example, female birds, snakes, and butterflies have ZW sex chromosomes, and males have ZZ sex chromosomes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Non-inverted Y chromosome===
There are some species, such as the [[Japanese rice fish]], the XY system is still developing and cross over between the X and Y is still possible. Because the male specific region is very small and contains no essential genes, it is even possible to artificially induce XX males and YY females to no ill effect.&lt;ref name=Schartl&gt;{{cite journal| author = Schartl, Manfred| title = A comparative view on sex determination in medaka| journal = Mechanisms of Development| volume = 121|issue=7–8| pages = 639–645| date = July 2004| url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925477304000371| accessdate =6 December 2011| doi=10.1016/j.mod.2004.03.001| pmid = 15210173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human Y chromosome==
In humans, the Y chromosome spans about 58 million [[base pair]]s (the building blocks of [[DNA]]) and represents approximately 1% of the total DNA in a male [[cell (biology)|cell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome=Y National Library of Medicine's Genetic Home Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; The human Y chromosome contains over 200 genes, at least 72 of which code for proteins.&lt;ref name="Chromosome Y"/&gt; Traits that are inherited via the Y chromosome are called [[Y linkage|Y-linked]], or holandric traits.

Some cells, especially in older men and [[tobacco smoking|smokers]], lack a Y chromosome. It has been found that men with a higher percentage of [[haematopoiesis|hematopoietic]] [[stem cells]] in blood lacking the Y chromosome (and perhaps a higher percentage of other cells lacking it) have a higher risk of certain [[cancer]]s and have a shorter life expectancy. Men with "loss of Y" (which was defined as no Y in at least 18% of their hematopoietic cells) have been found to die 5.5 years earlier on average than others. This has been interpreted as a sign that the Y chromosome plays a role going beyond sex determination and reproduction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lars A. Forsberg|title=Mosaic loss of chromosome Y in peripheral blood is associated with shorter survival and higher risk of cancer|journal=Nature Genetics|date=April 2014|volume=46|pages=624–628 |pmid=24777449 |doi=10.1038/ng.2966|issue=6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although the loss of Y may be an effect rather than a cause). And yet women, who have no Y chromosome, have lower rates of cancer. Male smokers have between 1.5 and 2 times the risk of non-respiratory cancers as female smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Andy Coghlan|title=Y men are more likely to get cancer than women|journal=New Scientist|date=13 December 2014|page=17|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22429995.800-y-men-are-more-likely-to-get-cancer-than-women.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jan P. Dumanski|title=Smoking is associated with mosaic loss of chromosome Y|journal=Science|date=December 2014 |pmid=25477213 |doi=10.1126/science.1262092|volume=347|issue=6217|pages=81–3|display-authors=etal|pmc=4356728|bibcode=2015Sci...347...81D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-combining region of Y (NRY)===
{{Further|Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup}}
The human Y chromosome is normally unable to recombine with the X chromosome, except for small pieces of [[pseudoautosomal region]]s at the [[telomere]]s (which comprise about 5% of the chromosome's length).  These regions are relics of ancient [[Homology (biology)|homology]] between the X and Y chromosomes. The bulk of the Y chromosome, which does not recombine, is called the "NRY", or non-recombining region of the Y chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080401184955.htm ''Science Daily'']'', Apr. 3, 2008.''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs) in this region are used to trace direct paternal ancestral lines. 

===Genes===
==== Number of genes ====
The following are some of the gene count estimates of human Y chromosome. Because researchers use different approaches to [[genome annotation]] their predictions of the [[number of genes]] on each chromosome varies (for technical details, see [[gene prediction]]). Among various projects, the collaborative consensus coding sequence project ([[Consensus CDS Project|CCDS]]) takes an extremely conservative strategy. So CCDS's gene number prediction represents a lower bound on the total number of human protein-coding genes.&lt;ref name="pmid20441615"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Pertea M, Salzberg SL| title=Between a chicken and a grape: estimating the number of human genes. | journal=Genome Biol | year= 2010 | volume= 11 | issue= 5 | pages= 206 | pmid=20441615 | doi=10.1186/gb-2010-11-5-206 | pmc=2898077 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=20441615  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Y-chromosome-linked diseases===
Diseases linked to the Y chromosome typically involve an [[aneuploidy]], an atypical number of chromosomes. 

=====Y chromosome microdeletion=====
[[Y chromosome microdeletion]] (YCM) is a family of genetic disorders caused by missing genes in the Y chromosome. Many affected men exhibit no symptoms and lead normal lives.  However, YCM is also known to be present in a significant number of men with reduced fertility or reduced sperm count.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=====Defective Y chromosome=====
This results in the person presenting a female [[phenotype]] (i.e., is born with female-like genitalia) even though that person possesses an XY [[karyotype]]. The lack of the second X results in infertility. In other words, viewed from the opposite direction, the person goes through [[defeminization]] but fails to complete [[Virilization|masculinization]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The cause can be seen as an incomplete Y chromosome: the usual karyotype in these cases is 45X, plus a fragment of Y. This usually results in defective testicular development, such that the infant may or may not have fully formed male genitalia internally or externally. The full range of ambiguity of structure may occur, especially if [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaicism]] is present. When the Y fragment is minimal and nonfunctional, the child is usually a girl with the features of [[Turner syndrome]] or [[mixed gonadal dysgenesis]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=====XXY=====
{{main|Klinefelter syndrome}}

Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) is not an [[aneuploidy]] of the Y chromosome, but a condition of having an extra X chromosome, which usually results in defective postnatal testicular function.  The mechanism is not fully understood; it does not seem to be due to direct interference by the extra X with expression of Y genes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=====XYY=====
{{main|XYY syndrome}}

47, XYY syndrome (simply known as XYY syndrome) is caused by the presence of a single extra copy of the Y chromosome in each of a male's cells. 47, XYY males have one X chromosome and two Y chromosomes, for a total of 47 chromosomes per cell. Researchers have found that an extra copy of the Y chromosome is associated with increased stature and an increased incidence of learning problems in some boys and men, but the effects are variable, often minimal, and the vast majority do not know their karyotype.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1965 and 1966 [[Patricia Jacobs]] and colleagues published a chromosome survey of 315 male patients at
[[Scotland]]'s only special security hospital for the [[developmental disability|developmentally disabled]],
finding a higher than expected number of patients to have an extra Y chromosome.&lt;ref name="jacobs-1965"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jacobs, Patricia A. |author2=Brunton, Muriel |author3=Melville, Marie M. |author4=Brittain, Robert P. |author5=McClemont, William F. |date=December 25, 1965 |title=Aggressive behavior, mental sub-normality and the XYY male |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=208 |issue=5017 |pages=1351–2 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v208/n5017/abs/2081351a0.html |doi=10.1038/2081351a0 |pmid=5870205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of this study wondered "whether an extra Y chromosome predisposes its carriers to unusually aggressive behaviour", and this conjecture "framed the next fifteen years of research on the human Y chromosome".&lt;ref name="richardson-sex-itself"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Sarah S.|title=Sex Itself: The Search for Male &amp; Female in the Human Genome|date=2013|publisher=U. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-08468-8|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through studies over the next decade, this conjecture was shown to be incorrect: the elevated crime rate of XYY males is due to lower median intelligence and not increased aggression,&lt;ref name="witkin-1976"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Witkin HA, Mednick SA, Schulsinger F, Bakkestrom E, Christiansen KO, Goodenough DR, Hirschhorn K, Lundsteen C, Owen DR, Philip J, Rubin DB, Stocking M | title = Criminality in XYY and XXY men | journal = Science | volume = 193 | issue = 4253 | pages = 547–55 | date = August 1976 | pmid = 959813 | doi = 10.1126/science.959813| bibcode = 1976Sci...193..547W }}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased height was the only characteristic that could be reliably associated with XYY males.&lt;ref name="witkin-1977"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Witkin, Herman A. |author2=Goodenough, Donald R. |author3=Hirschhorn, Kurt |date=1977 |title=XYY Men: Are They Criminally Aggressive? |journal=The Sciences |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=10–13 |doi=10.1002/j.2326-1951.1977.tb01570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "criminal karyotype" concept is therefore inaccurate.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

====Rare====
The following Y-chromosome-linked diseases are rare, but notable because of their elucidating of the nature of the Y chromosome.

=====More than two Y chromosomes=====
Greater degrees of Y chromosome polysomy (having more than one extra copy of the Y chromosome in every cell, e.g., XYYY) are rare. The extra genetic material in these cases can lead to skeletal abnormalities, decreased IQ, and delayed development, but the severity features of these conditions are variable.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=====XX male syndrome=====
[[XX male syndrome]] occurs when there has been a [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] in the formation of the male [[gamete]]s, causing the [[SRY]] portion of the Y chromosome to move to the X chromosome. When such an X chromosome contributes to the child, the development will lead to a male, because of the SRY gene.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Genetic genealogy ===
{{Main|Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosomal Adam}}

In human [[genetic genealogy]] (the application of [[genetics]] to [[Genealogy|traditional genealogy]]), use of the information contained in the Y chromosome is of particular interest because, unlike other chromosomes, the Y chromosome is passed exclusively from father to son, on the patrilineal line. [[Mitochondrial DNA]], maternally inherited to both sons and daughters, is used in an analogous way to trace the matrilineal line.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Brain function===
Research is currently investigating whether male-pattern neural development is a direct consequence of Y-chromosome-related gene expression or an indirect result of Y-chromosome-related androgenic hormone production.&lt;ref name="Kopsida 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Role of the Y Chromosome in Brain Function | journal = The Open Neuroendocrinology Journal | first = Eleni | last = Kopsida |author2=Evangelia Stergiakouli |author3=Phoebe M.

===Microchimerism===
The presence of male chromosomes in fetal cells in the blood circulation of women was discovered in 1974.&lt;ref name="SchroederEtAl1974"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Schröder J, Thlikainen A, de la Chapelle A|title=Fetal leukocytes in the maternal circulation after delivery: Cytological aspects|journal=Transplantation|volume=17|issue=4|year=1974|pages=346–354|issn=0041-1337|doi=10.1097/00007890-197404000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, it was found that male fetal progenitor cells could persist postpartum in the maternal blood stream for as long as 27 years.&lt;ref name="BianchiEtAl1996"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bianchi D. W. |author2=Zickwolf G. K. |author3=Weil G. J. |author4=Sylvester S. |author5=DeMaria M. A. | year = 1996 | title = Male fetal progenitor cells persist in maternal blood for as long as 27 years postpartum | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 93 | issue = 2| pages = 705–708 | doi=10.1073/pnas.93.2.705 | pmid=8570620 | pmc=40117|bibcode=1996PNAS...93..705B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 study at the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]], Seattle, investigated the origin of male chromosomes found in the peripheral blood of women who had not had male progeny. A total of 120 subjects (women who had never had sons) were investigated, and it was found that 21% of them had male DNA. The subjects were categorised into four groups based on their case histories:&lt;ref name="YanEtAl2004"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Male microchimerism in women without sons: Quantitative assessment and correlation with pregnancy history|url=http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(05)00270-6/fulltext|author=Yan, Zhen|author2=Lambert, Nathalie C.|author3=Guthrie, Katherine A.|author4=Porter, Allison J.|author5=Loubiere, Laurence S.|author6=Madeleine, Margaret M.|author7=Stevens, Anne M.|author8=Hermes, Heidi M.|author9=Nelson, J. Lee|last-author-amp=yes|journal =The American Journal of Medicine|volume=118| issue=8|pages=899–906 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2005.03.037 |format=full text |accessdate=24 December 2014 |pmid=16084184 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Group A (8%) had had only female progeny.
* Patients in Group B (22%) had a history of one or more miscarriages.
* Patients Group C (57%) had their pregnancies medically terminated.
* Group D (10%) had never been pregnant before.

The study noted that 10% of the women had never been pregnant before, raising the question of where the Y chromosomes in their blood could have come from. The study suggests that possible reasons for occurrence of male chromosome microchimerism could be one of the following:&lt;ref name="YanEtAl2004"/&gt;
* miscarriages,
* pregnancies,
* vanished male twin,
* possibly from sexual intercourse.

A 2012 study at the same institute has detected cells with the Y chromosome in multiple areas of the brains of deceased women.&lt;ref name="ChanEtAl2012"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Male microchimerism in the human female brain|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0045592|journal=PLOS ONE|date=26 September 2012|volume=7|issue=9|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0045592|author=Chan W.
