      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6533">On 25 January 2014, Chang Ter-cheng (張德正) attempted to drive a 35-tonne truck through the main doors of the [[Presidential Office Building, Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/01/26/2003582157 |title=Truck crashes into Presidential Office |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2014-04-14 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
At 5:05 am, Chang drove a 35-tonne truck towards the office at a speed of 72 km/h, ramming through four layers of defensive barriers and going up the stairs before being stopped by a bulletproof door leading to the entrance of the presidential office building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/01/26/2003582158 |title=Task force to review security after truck breaches office |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2014-04-14 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentries guards of the 211th battalion, [[ROC Military Police]] slammed shut the bulletproof door within seconds after they saw the vehicle was heading towards them. It only took five seconds for the truck to hit the building after it left [[Ketagalan Boulevard]]. No sentries guarding the gate were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2014/01/26/399301/Presidential-Office.htm |title=Presidential Office rammed by truck |publisher=The China Post |date=2014-01-26 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chang was taken immediately by the police to the [[National Taiwan University Hospital]] for treatment from injuries due to the collision. He regained consciousness later.

At the time of the incident, President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] was in [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] on an official trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/asia/story/35-tonne-truck-rams-taiwan-president-ma-ying-jeous-office-20140125 |title=35-tonne truck rams into Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou's office |work=Straits Times |date=2014-01-25 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/345508/news/world/truck-rams-into-taiwan-president-s-office |title=Truck rams into Taiwan president's office &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; GMA News Online |publisher=Gmanetwork.com |date=2014-01-25 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Presidential Office invited the [[National Police Agency (Republic of China)|National Police Agency]], [[National Security Bureau (Republic of China)|National Security Bureau]] and [[National Police Agency (Republic of China)#Taipei City Police Department|Taipei City Police Department]] for a meeting to discuss on how to better secure the presidential office building in the future.&lt;ref name="chinapost1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2014/01/26/399303/Bullet-proof-door.htm |title=Bullet-proof door blocked truck within seconds: official |publisher=The China Post |date=2014-01-26 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Presidential Office had ordered a new and thicker bullet proof door to be installed as soon as possible. A new 18 concrete flower-stands had also been installed in front of the building right after the incident occurred.

Wu Chung-ho (吳仲和), the guard who closed the bulletproof door before the truck slammed into the building, was awarded a medal and given extra vacation days in for his actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/01/27/2003582233/2 |title=Police probe Chang Te-cheng’s motive |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2014-04-14 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoXlicZeF2A |title=不畏7千噸衝擊 菜鳥秒按立大功 |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-01-26 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taiwan High Court sentenced the perpetrator to six years in prison on 9 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tsai|first1=P.C.|last2=Lin|first2=Lillian|title=Man who rammed truck into Presidential Office entrance sentenced|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201509090023.aspx|accessdate=9 September 2015|agency=Central News Agency|date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pan|first1=Jason|title=Six-year term for Presidential Office Building ramming|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/09/10/2003627382|accessdate=9 September 2015|work=Taipei Times|date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, the Taipei Distinct Court ordered Chang to pay NT$3.44 million in damages to the Presidential Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tsai|first1=Page|last2=Wu|first2=Lilian|title=In truck ramming case, NT$3.44 million ordered in compensation|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201512080011.aspx|accessdate=8 December 2015|agency=Central News Agency|date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, the Taiwan High Court decided that Hau Ming Enterprise Co., Chang's employer at the time of the [[vehicle-ramming attack]], and Chang himself were to split the cost of compensation paid to the Presidential Office. Hau Ming filed an appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China|Supreme Court]], which was heard in January 2017. The Supreme upheld the ruling of High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Yang-yu|last2=Hsu|first2=Elizabeth|title=Man who rammed Presidential Office fined; case closed|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201701120009.aspx|accessdate=12 January 2017|agency=Central News Agency|date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

[[President of the Republic of China|ROC President]] [[Ma Ying-jeou]] asked officials to handle this incident carefully by following all [[standard operating procedures]].

ROC Presidential Office Secretary-General [[Timothy Yang]] said that a team will be established and charged with improving security around the building.&lt;ref name="chinapost1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1msdMCL3bA |title=驚險關鍵五秒! 菜鳥憲兵急按下防彈鋼門 |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-01-25 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mayor of Taipei|Taipei Mayor]] [[Hau Lung-pin]] demanded the police increase security around the Presidential Office Building to avoid similar incidents in the future.

'''Ainu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|n|uː}};&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; Ainu: {{lang|ain|アイヌ・イタㇰ}} ''Aynu=itak''; [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: {{lang|ja|アイヌ語}} ''Ainu-go'') is a language spoken by members of the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] [[ethnic group]] on the northern Japanese island of [[Hokkaido]].

Until the 20th century, Ainu languages were also spoken throughout the southern half of the island of [[Ainu in Russia|Sakhalin]] and by small numbers of people in the [[Kuril Islands]]. There are three main dialects&lt;ref name = martin&gt;Martin, K. (2011). Aynu itak. On the Road to Ainu Language Revitalization. Media and Communication Studies. 60: 57-93&lt;/ref&gt; along with 19 other dialects of the Ainu languages. Only the Hokkaido variant survives, the last speaker of Sakhalin Ainu having died in 1994. Hokkaido Ainu is moribund, though attempts are being made to revive it. The Japanese government made a decision to recognize Ainu as indigenous in June 2008.&lt;ref name = martin/&gt; Currently, the Japanese government is constructing a facility dedicated to preserving Ainu culture, including the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-sight/wp/2017/07/28/land-of-the-human-beings-the-world-of-the-ainu-little-known-indigenous-people-of-japan/|title=Perspective {{!}} ‘Land of the Human Beings’: The world of the Ainu, little-known indigenous people of Japan|last=Lam|first=May-Ying|date=27 July 2017|website=Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ainu has no generally accepted genealogical relationship to any other language family.

Depending on the classification system used, According to [[UNESCO]], Ainu is considered an [[endangered language]].&lt;ref name = martin/&gt; As of 2016, ''Ethnologue'' lists Ainu as class 8b: "nearly extinct".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M. Paul, Gary F. Simons, and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). 2016. ''[http://www.ethnologue.com Ethnologue: Languages of the World], Nineteenth edition.'' Dallas, Texas: SIL International.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been endangered since before the 1960s. There are approximately 30,000 Ainu people in Japan,&lt;ref name = gayman&gt;Gayman, J. (2012). Ainu Right to Education and Ainu Practice of “Education “: Current Situation and imminent Issues in Light of Indigenous Education Rights and Theory. Intercultural Education. Vol. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and only 15 speakers remaining with 304 people understanding the Ainu language. However, those numbers are uncertain because of other Ainu speakers who have not claimed as Ainu.&lt;ref name="Okazaki, T 2011"&gt;Okazaki, T &amp; Teeter, J. (2011). Ainu as a Heritage Language of Japan: History, Current State and Future of Ainu Language Policy and Education. Heritage Language Journal. 8 (2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revitalization==
In general, Ainu people are hard to find because they tend to hide their identity as Ainu. Especially in the young generation, 66% of Ainu youth do not know that they are Ainu.&lt;ref name="gayman" /&gt; In addition, because of Ainu students being strongly recommended to speak Japanese in school due to assimilation, and [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|MEXT]] (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology) being only concerned with English and Japanese,&lt;ref&gt;Hanks,H, D (2017). Policy Barriers to Ainu Language Revitalization in Japan: When Globalization Means English.  Working Papers in Educational Linguistics 32(1): pp. 91-110.&lt;/ref&gt; it has been challenging for the Ainu language to be revitalized.

Despite this, there is an active movement to [[Language revitalization|revitalize]] the language, mainly in Hokkaido but also elsewhere such as [[Kantō region|Kanto]].&lt;ref name="martin" /&gt; Ainu oral literature has been documented both in hopes of safeguarding it for future generations, as well as using it as a teaching tool for language learners.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10271487|title=Vanishing Languages of the Pacific Rim|date=2007-01-01|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191532894|location=Oxford, GB|pages=377–382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1987, the [[Ainu Association of Hokkaido]] with approximately 500 members&lt;ref name="martin" /&gt; began hosting 14 Ainu language classes, Ainu language instructors training courses and Family Ainu Learning Initiative&lt;ref name="gayman" /&gt; and have released instructional materials on the language, including a textbook.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Also, [[Wajin (ancient people)|Wajin]] linguists teach Ainu and train students to become Ainu instructor in university.&lt;ref name="gayman" /&gt; In spite of these efforts, the Ainu language is not yet taught as a subject in any secondary school in Japan.&lt;ref name="martin" /&gt;

Due to the Ainu Cultural Promotion Act of 1997, Ainu dictionaries transformed and became tools for improving communication and preserving records of the Ainu language in order to revitalize the language and promote the culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hansen|first1=A.S.|date=2014|title=Re-vitalizing an indigenous language: Dictionaries of Ainu languages in Japan, 1625-2013|journal=Lexicographica|volume=30|issue=1|pages=547–578}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is now an increasing number of second-language learners, especially in Hokkaido, in large part due to the pioneering efforts of the late Ainu folklorist, activist and former [[Japanese Diet|Diet]] member [[Shigeru Kayano]], himself a native speaker, who first opened an Ainu language school in 1987 funded by [[Ainu Kyokai]],&lt;ref name="Okazaki, T 2011"/&gt;. The [[Ainu Association of Hokkaido]] is the main supporter of Ainu culture in Hokkaido. Ainu language classes have been conducted in some areas in Japan and small numbers of young people are learning Ainu. Efforts have also been made to produce web-accessible materials for conversational Ainu because most documentation of the Ainu language focused on the recording of folktales.&lt;ref&gt;Bugaeva, Anna (2010). "Internet applications for endangered languages: A talking dictionary of Ainu". Waseda Institute for Advanced Study Research Bulletin 3: 73–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Ainu language has been in media as well; the first Ainu radio program was called [https://tunein.com/radio/FM-Pipaushi-p323895/ FM Pipaushi] which runs since 2001 along with 15 minute radio Ainu language lessons funded by [https://www.frpac.or.jp/web/english/ FRPAC], and news paper "[[Ainu Times|The Ainu Times]]" has been established since 1997.&lt;ref name="Okazaki, T 2011"/&gt; In addition, the Ainu language has been seen in public domains such as the outlet shopping complex's name, "Rera" which means "wind" in [[Minami-Chitose Station|Minami Chitose]] area and the name "Pewre" meaning "young" at shopping centre in [[Chitose, Hokkaido|Chitose]] area. There is also a basketball team in [[Sapporo]] named "Pera Kamuy" which means "God of Wind".&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt; The well-known Japanese fashion magazine's name, "[[Non-no]]" is also in the Ainu language, which means "flower".

== Phonology ==
Ainu [[syllable]]s are CV(C), that is, they have an obligatory [[syllable onset]] and an optional [[syllable coda]]. There are few [[consonant cluster]]s.

There are five [[vowel]] sounds in Ainu: /a, e, i, o, u/.
=== Consonants ===

Plosives {{IPA|/p t ts k/}} may be voiced {{IPA|[b d dz ɡ]}} between vowels and after nasals. Both {{IPA|/ti/}} and {{IPA|/tsi/}} are realized as {{IPA|[t͡ʃi]}}, and {{IPA|/s/}} becomes {{IPA|[ʃ]}} before {{IPA|/i/}} and at the end of syllables. There is some variation among dialects; in the [[Sakhalin]] dialect, syllable-final {{IPA|/p}}, {{IPA|t}}, {{IPA|k}}, {{IPA|r/}} [[lenition|lenited]] and merged into {{IPA|/x/}}. After an {{IPA|/i/}}, this {{IPA|/x/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ç]}}. A glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} is often inserted at the beginning of words, before an accented vowel, but is non-phonemic.

There is a [[pitch accent]] system. The accentuation of specific words varies somewhat from dialect to dialect. Generally, words including [[affix]]es have a high pitch on the stem, or on the first syllable if it is closed or has a diphthong, while other words have the high pitch on the second syllable, although there are exceptions to this generalization.

== Typology and grammar ==
[[linguistic typology|Typologically]], Ainu is similar in word order (and some aspects of phonology) to [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

Ainu has a canonical word order of [[subject–object–verb|SOV]],&lt;ref name="wals.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_ain |title=Ainu |publisher=Wals.info |date= |accessdate=2012-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it uses postpositions rather than [[preposition]]s. [[Noun]]s can cluster to modify one another; the head comes at the end. Verbs, which are inherently either [[Transitivity (grammatical category)|transitive]] or intransitive, accept various [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational affixes]]. Ainu does not have [[grammatical gender]]. Plurals are indicated by a suffix.&lt;ref name="wals.info"/&gt;

Classical Ainu, the language of the ''[[yukar]]'', is [[polysynthetic]], with [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]] of nouns and adverbs; this is greatly reduced in the modern colloquial language.

[[Applicative voice|Applicatives]] may be used in Ainu to place nouns in the [[Dative case|dative]], [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], [[Comitative case|comitative]], [[Locative case|locative]], [[Allative case|allative]], or [[Ablative case|ablative]] roles. Besides freestanding nouns, these roles may be assigned to incorporated nouns, and such use of applicatives is in fact mandatory for incorporating [[Oblique case|oblique]] nouns. Like incorporation, applicatives have grown less common in the modern language.

Ainu has a closed class of [[plural verb]]s, and some of these are [[Suppletion|suppletive]].

== Writing ==
The Ainu language is written in a modified version of the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[katakana]] [[syllabary]]. There is also a [[Latin script|Latin-based alphabet]] in use. The ''[[Ainu Times]]'' publishes in both. In the Latin [[orthography]], {{IPA|/ts/}} is spelled ''c'' and {{IPA|/j/}} is spelled ''y''; the glottal stop, {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, which only occurs initially before accented vowels, is not written. Other phonemes use the same character as the IPA transcription given above. An equals sign (=) is used to mark [[morpheme]] boundaries, such as after a prefix. Its pitch accent is denoted by [[acute accent]] in Latin script (e.g., ''á''). This is usually not denoted in katakana.

Rev. [[John Batchelor (missionary)|John Batchelor]] was an English missionary who lived among the Ainu, studied them and published many works on the Ainu language.&lt;ref name="Frédéric"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frédéric|first=Louis|others=Käthe Roth, translator |title=Japan encyclopedia|publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2005|edition=illustrated, reprint|page=13|chapter=Ainu|isbn=0-674-01753-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0skIAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=1877+theologian+john+batchelor++missionary+studied|edition=4|year=1957|location=|isbn=|title=The living past|author=Ivar Lissner|publisher=Putnam's|page=204|pages=|quote=In 1877 a young and industrious theologian went to visit the Ainu.

He was the first to write in Ainu and use a writing system for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wbFCAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=john+batchelor+foreigner+japanese&amp;q=batchelor+ainu+hitherto+wrote+books|edition=4|year=1943|location=|isbn=|title=...Why Japan was strong|author=John Patric|publisher=Doubleday, Doran &amp; Company, Inc.|page=72|pages=|quote=John Batchelor set about to learn the Ainu language, which the Japanese had not troubled ever to learn.

Other books written in Ainu include dictionaries, a grammar, and books on Ainu culture and language.&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"&gt;ethnologue.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Special katakana for the Ainu language ===
A [[Unicode]] standard exists for a set of extended [[katakana]] ([[Katakana Phonetic Extensions]]) for transliterating the Ainu language and other languages written with katakana.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/katakana_phonetic_extensions.html this page] at alanwood.net and [https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U31F0.pdf this section] of the Unicode specification.&lt;/ref&gt; These characters are used to write final consonants and sounds that cannot be expressed using conventional katakana. The extended katakana are based on regular katakana and either are smaller in size or have a [[handakuten]]. As few fonts yet support these extensions, workarounds exist for many of the characters, such as using a smaller font with the regular katakana ク ''ku'' to produce &lt;span style="font-size:70%;" lang="ja" class="t_nihongo_kana"&gt;ク&lt;/span&gt; to represent the separate small katakana glyph{{lang|ain|ㇰ}}''ku'' used as in {{lang|ain|アイヌイタㇰ}} (''Aynu itak'').

This is a list of special katakana used in transcribing the Ainu language. Most of the characters are of the extended set of katakana, though a few have been used historically in Japanese{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}, and thus are part of the main set of katakana. A number of previously proposed characters have not been added to Unicode as they can be represented as a sequence of two existing codepoints.

=== Diphthongs ===
[[Syllable coda|Final]] {{IPA|[ɪ]}} is spelled ''y'' in Latin, small ィ in katakana. Final {{IPA|[ʊ]}} is spelled ''w'' in Latin, small ゥ in katakana. {{IPA|[ae]}} is spelled ''ae'', アエ, or アェ.

Example with [[Syllable onset|initial]] ''k'':
{| class="wikitable"
! {{IPA|[kaɪ]}} !! {{IPA|[ku̜ɪ]}} !! {{IPA|[koɪ]}} !! {{IPA|[kaʊ]}} !! {{IPA|[kiʊ]}} !! {{IPA|[keʊ]}} !! {{IPA|[koʊ]}} !! {{IPA|[keɪ]}}
|-
| kay || kuy || koy || kaw || kiw || kew || {{lang|ain|kow}} || key
|-
| カィ || クィ || コィ || カゥ || キゥ || ケゥ || コゥ || ケィ
|}

Since the above rule is used systematically, some katakana combinations have different sounds from conventional Japanese.

=== Long vowels ===

There are long vowels in the Sakhalin dialect. Either a [[circumflex]] or [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] is used in the [[Latin]] alphabet, and the [[Chōon|long vowel sign]] (ー) is used in katakana.

== Oral literature ==
The Ainu have a rich [[Oral literature|oral tradition]] of hero-sagas called ''[[yukar]]'', which retain a number of grammatical and lexical archaisms. Yukar was memorized and told at get-togethers and ceremonies that often lasted hours or even days. The Ainu also have another form of narrative often used called "[[Uepeker]]", which was used in the same contexts.

==Varieties==
Shibatani (1990:9) and [[Bronisław Piłsudski|Piłsudski]] (1998:2) speak of "Ainu languages" when comparing the varieties of Hokkaidō and Sakhalin. However, [[Alexander Vovin|Vovin]] (1993) speaks only of "dialects". Refsing (1986) says Hokkaidō and Sakhalin Ainu were not [[mutually intelligible]]. Hattori (1964) considered Ainu data from 19 regions of Hokkaido and Sakhalin, and found the primary division to lie between the two islands.

*Data on Kuril Ainu is scarce, but it is thought to have been as divergent as Sakhalin and Hokkaidō.
*In Sakhalin Ainu, an eastern coastal dialect of Taraika (near modern Gastello ([[Poronaysk]])) was quite divergent from the other localities. The Raychishka dialect, on the western coast near modern [[Uglegorsk, Sakhalin Oblast|Uglegorsk]], is the best documented, and has a dedicated grammatical description. [[Take Asai]], the last speaker of Sakhalin Ainu, died in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Collected Works of Bronisław Piłsudski |volume=3 |series=Trends in Linguistics Series |last=Piłsudski |first=Bronisław |authorlink=Bronisław Piłsudski |author2=Alfred F. Majewicz |year=2004 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |location= |isbn=9783110176148 |page=600 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NX0W2N8pgWQC |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sakhalin Ainu dialects had long vowels and a final -h phoneme, which they pronounced as /[[Voiceless velar fricative|x]]/.
*Hokkaidō Ainu clustered into several dialects with substantial differences between them: the 'neck' of the island ([[Oshima Subprefecture|Oshima County]], data from [[Oshamanbe, Hokkaidō|Oshamambe]] and [[Yakumo, Hokkaidō|Yakumo]]); the "Classical" Ainu of central Hokkaidō around [[Sapporo]] and the southern coast ([[Iburi Subprefecture|Iburi]] and [[Hidaka Subprefecture|Hidaka]] counties, data from [[Noboribetsu, Hokkaidō|Horobetsu]], [[Biratori, Hokkaidō|Biratori]], Nukkibetsu, and [[Niikappu, Hokkaidō|Niikappu]]; historical records from [[Ishikari Subprefecture|Ishikari County]] and [[Sapporo]] show that these were similar); [[Samani, Hokkaidō|Samani]] (on the southeastern cape in Hidaka, but perhaps closest to the northeastern dialect); the northeast (data from [[Obihiro, Hokkaidō|Obihiro]], [[Kushiro, Hokkaidō|Kushiro]], and [[Bihoro, Hokkaidō|Bihoro]]); the north-central dialect ([[Kamikawa Subprefecture|Kamikawa County]], data from [[Asahikawa, Hokkaidō|Asahikawa]] and [[Nayoro, Hokkaidō|Nayoro]]); and [[Sōya Subprefecture|Sōya]] (on the northwestern cape), which was closest of all Hokkaidō varieties to Sakhalin Ainu. Most texts and grammatical descriptions we have of Ainu cover the Central Hokkaidō dialect.

Scanty data from Western voyages at the turn of the 19th–20th century (Tamura 2000) suggest there was also great diversity in northern Sakhalin, which was not sampled by Hattori.

==Ainu on mainland Japan==
It is often reported that Ainu was the language of the indigenous [[Emishi]] people of the northern part of the main Japanese island of [[Honshu]].&lt;ref&gt;Or perhaps one of the peoples called Emishi; it is not known that the Emishi were a single ethnicity.&lt;/ref&gt; The main evidence for this is the presence of [[toponym|placenames]] that appear to be of Ainu origin in both locations. For example, the ''-betsu'' common to many northern Japanese place names is known to derive from the Ainu word ''pet'' "river" in Hokkaidō, and the same is suspected of similar names ending in ''-be'' in northern Honshū and [[Chūbu region|Chūbu]], such as the [[Kurobe River|Kurobe]] and [[Oyabe River|Oyabe]] rivers in [[Toyama Prefecture]] (Miller 1967:239, Shibatani 1990:3, Vovien 2008). Other place names in [[Kantō region|Kantō]] and [[Chūbu region|Chūbu]], such as [[Mount Ashigara]] (Kanagawa–Shizuoka), [[Musashi Province|Musashi]] (modern Tokyo), [[:ja:気多神社|Keta Shrine]] (Toyama), and the [[Noto Peninsula]], have no explanation in Japanese, but do in Ainu. The traditional [[Matagi]] hunters of the mountain forests of [[Tōhoku region|Tōhoku]] retain Ainu words in their hunting vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Kudō Masaki (1989:134). ''Jōsaku to emishi''. Kōkogaku Library #51. New Science Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanigawa, Ken'ichi (1980:324–325). ''Collected works'', vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under pressure from the Japanese conquest, some Emishi migrated north to [[Tōhoku region|Tohoku]] and Hokkaido. The historical Ainu of (southern) Hokkaido appear to be a fusion of this culture, known archeologically as [[Satsumon culture|Satsumon]], and the very different [[Nivkh people|Nivkh]]- and [[Itelmens|Itelmen]]-like [[Okhotsk culture]] of (northern) Hokkaido, with Satsumon being dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson ''Ruins of identity: ethnogenesis in the Japanese Islands''&lt;/ref&gt; The Ainu of Sakhalin and the Kurils appear to have been a relatively recent expansion from Hokkaido, displacing the indigenous Okhotsk culture (in the case of Sakhalin, Ainu oral history records their displacement of an indigenous people they called the ''Tonchi'' who, based on toponymic evidence, were evidently the Nivkh),&lt;ref&gt;Gruzdeva, "The linguistics situation on Sakhalin Island". in Wurm et al. (1996:1008) ''Atlas of languages of intercultural communication in the Pacific, Asia and the Americas''&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed a mixed Kamchadal–Kuril Ainu population is attested from southern Kamchatka.

==History ==
Many of the speakers of Ainu lost the language with the advent of Japanese colonization. During a time when food production methods were changing across Japan, there was less reason to trade with the Ainu, who mainly fished and foraged the land. Japan was becoming more industrialized and globalization created a threat to Japanese land. The Japanese government, in an attempt to unify their country to keep out invasion, created policy for the assimilation of the Ainu diversity, culture, and subsistence.&lt;ref name="transition"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheung|first=S.C.H.|date=2003|title=Ainu Culture in Transition|url=|journal=Futures|volume=35 | issue = 9 |pages=951–959|via=|doi=10.1016/s0016-3287(03)00051-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maruyama|first=Hiroshi|date=2014-07-03|title=Japan's Policies Towards the Ainu Language and Culture with Special Reference to North Fennoscandian Sami Policies|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08003831.2014.967980|journal=Acta Borealia|volume=31|issue=2|pages=152–175|doi=10.1080/08003831.2014.967980|issn=0800-3831}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heritagelanguages.org/Journal.aspx|title=HLJ|website=www.heritagelanguages.org|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assimilation included exploitation of land, commodification of culture, and placing Ainu children in schools where they only learned Japanese.&lt;ref name="transition" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

More recently, the Japanese government has acknowledged the Ainu people as an indigenous population. As of 1997 they were given indigenous rights under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) to their culture, heritage, and language.&lt;ref name="transition" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savage|first=Theresa|last2=Longo|first2=Michael|date=2013-05-01|title=Legal Frameworks for the Protection of Ainu Language and Culture in Japan: International and European Perspectives|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10371397.2013.782098|journal=Japanese Studies|volume=33|issue=1|pages=101–120|doi=10.1080/10371397.2013.782098|issn=1037-1397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ainu Cultural Promotion Act in 1997 appointed the Foundation for Research and Promotion of Ainu Culture (FRPAC).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This foundation is tasked with language education, where they promote Ainu language learning through training instructors, advanced language classes, and creation and development of language materials.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Classification==
Vovin (1993) splits Ainu dialects as follows (Vovin 1993:157).

*'''Proto-Ainu'''
**Proto-Hokkaido–Kuril
***[[Hokkaido Ainu language|Hokkaido dialects]]
***[[Kuril Ainu language|Kuril dialects]]
**Proto-Sakhalin
***[[Sakhalin Ainu language|Sakhalin dialects]]

==External relationships==
No genealogical relationship between Ainu and any other language family has been demonstrated, despite numerous attempts. Thus, it is a [[language isolate]]. Ainu is sometimes grouped with the [[Paleosiberian languages]], but this is only a geographic blanket term for several unrelated language families that were present in Siberia before the advances of Turkic and Tungusic languages there. Another suggestion is that [[Nihali language|Nihali]] and [[Kusunda language|Kusunda]] are remnants of a northern division, that once extended to Japan. The most frequent proposals for relatives of Ainu are given below.

[[Alexander Vovin]] (2016)&lt;ref&gt;Vovin, Alexander. 2016. "On the Linguistic Prehistory of Hokkaidō." In ''Crosslinguistics and linguistic crossings in Northeast Asia: papers on the languages of Sakhalin and adjacent regions'' (Studia Orientalia 117).&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Ainu has had early contact with the unrelated [[Nivkh language|Nivkh]] language, and that this contact had most likely happened on [[Hokkaido]] island. Today, Nivkh is spoken only on [[Sakhalin]] island and at the mouth of the [[Amur River]]. Ainu of Sakhalin has more recent influence from Nivkh that Ainu of Hokkaido does not have.

===Altaic===
John C. Street (1962) proposed linking Ainu, [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] in one family and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]], and [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] in another, with the two families linked in a common "North Asiatic" family. Street's grouping was an extension of the [[Altaic]] hypothesis, which at the time linked Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic, sometimes adding Korean; today Altaic sometimes includes Korean and rarely Japanese but not Ainu (Georg et al. 1999).

From a perspective more centered on Ainu, James Patrie (1982) adopted the same grouping, namely Ainu–Korean–Japanese and Turkic–Mongolic–Tungusic, with these two families linked in a common family, as in Street's "North Asiatic".

[[Joseph Greenberg]] (2000–2002) likewise classified Ainu with Korean and Japanese. He regarded "Korean–Japanese-Ainu" as forming a branch of his proposed Eurasiatic language family. Greenberg did not hold Korean–Japanese–Ainu to have an especially close relationship with Turkic–Mongolic–Tungusic within this family.

The theory is now seen as discredited.&lt;ref&gt;"While 'Altaic' is repeated in encyclopedias and handbooks most specialists in these languages no longer believe that the three traditional supposed Altaic groups, Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic, are related." Lyle Campbell &amp; Mauricio J. Mixco, A Glossary of Historical Linguistics (2007, University of Utah Press), pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When cognates proved not to be valid, Altaic was abandoned, and the received view now is that Turkic, Mongolian, and Tungusic are unrelated." Johanna Nichols, Linguistic Diversity in Space and Time (1992, Chicago), pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Careful examination indicates that the established families, Turkic, Mongolian, and Tungusic, form a linguistic area (called Altaic)...Sufficient criteria have not been given that would justify talking of a genetic relationship here." R.M.W. Dixon, The Rise and Fall of Languages (1997, Cambridge), pg. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"...[T]his selection of features does not provide good evidence for common descent" and "we can observe convergence rather than divergence between Turkic and Mongolic languages--a pattern than is easily explainable by borrowing and diffusion rather than common descent", Asya Pereltsvaig, Languages of the World, An Introduction (2012, Cambridge) has a good discussion of the Altaic hypothesis (pp. 211-216).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japonic, Austroasiatic and Austronesian===
Shafer (1965) presented evidence suggesting a distant connection with the [[Austroasiatic languages]], which include many of the indigenous languages of Southeast Asia. Vovin (1992) presented his reconstruction of Proto-Ainu with evidence, in the form of proposed sound changes and cognates, of a relationship with Austroasiatic. In Vovin (1993), he still regarded this hypothesis as preliminary.

The eminent Japanese linguist [[Shichirō Murayama]] tried to link Japanese to the [[Austronesian languages]], which include the languages of the [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippines]], [[Formosan languages|Taiwan]], and [[languages of Indonesia|Indonesia]], through both vocabulary and cultural comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shichirō | first1 = Murayama | year = 1976 | title = The Malayo-Polynesian component in the Japanese language | url = | journal = Journal of Japanese Studies | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 413–436 | doi=10.2307/132060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 analysis using the [[Automated Similarity Judgment Program]] resulted in the [[Japonic languages]] being grouped with the Ainu and then with the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Jäger, "Support for linguistic macrofamilies from weighted sequence alignment." ''PNAS'' vol. 112 no. 41, 12752–12757, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1500331112. Published online before print September 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language contact==
The Ainu appear to have experienced intensive contact with the [[Nivkh people|Nivkhs]] during the course of their history. It is not known to what extent this has affected the language. Linguists believe the vocabulary shared between Ainu and [[Nivkh language|Nivkh]] (historically spoken in the northern half of [[Sakhalin]] and on the Asian mainland facing it) is due to [[Loanword|borrowing]].

The other group of people with whom the Ainu came into extensive contact was Japanese people since the 14th century. Analytic grammatical constructions acquired or transformed in Ainu were probably due to contact with the Japanese and the Japonic languages that had heavy influence on the Ainu language with a large number of loanwords borrowed into the Ainu language and to a smaller extent vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QB3DD8qSVnAC&amp;pg=PA499&amp;dq=Ainu+language+influenced+by+Japanese&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj34cP1xobVAhXhDsAKHS7CC8sQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Ainu%20language%20influenced%20by%20Japanese&amp;f=false The Languages of Japan and Korea, edited by Nicolas Tranter]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a great number of [[loanword]]s from the Japanese language in various stages of its development to Hokkaidō Ainu, and a smaller number of loanwords from Ainu into Japanese, particularly animal names such as ''rakko'' "sea otter" (Ainu ''rakko''), ''tonakai'' "reindeer" (Ainu ''tunakkay''), and ''[[shishamo]]'' (a fish, ''Spirinchus lanceolatus'') (Ainu ''susam''). Due to the low status of Ainu in Japan, many ancient loanwords may be ignored or undetected, but there is evidence of an older substrate, where older Japanese words which have no clear etymology appear related to Ainu words which do. An example is modern Japanese ''sake'' or ''shake'' meaning “salmon”, probably from Ainu ''sak ipe'' or ''shak embe'' for "salmon", literally "summer food".

'''AirportWatch''' is an environmental group which campaigns for sustainable air transport through reduction or redistribution of demand, determined by either timing or location ([[Transportation Demand Management|Demand Management]] approach).

==History==
AirportWatch was formed in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airportwatch.org.uk|title=AirportWatch website|accessdate=2007-12-27|publisher=AirportWatch| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080113150200/http://www.airportwatch.org.uk/| archivedate= 13 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the 2007 [[Camp for Climate Action]] near [[Heathrow Airport]], [[BAA Limited|BAA]] sought an injunction, banning members of groups supporting AirportWatch, such as the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and [[Greenpeace]], from attending the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Catch-all Heathrow protest injunction could bar millions|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jul/27/climatechange?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=11|accessdate=2007-12-27|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2007-07-27 | location=London | first=John | last=Vidal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airport operator won a reduced injunction naming senior members of AirportWatch and [[Plane Stupid]], but not including AirportWatch or its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heathrow airport's operator wins injunction to stop protesters|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/06/europe/EU-GEN-Britain-Heathrow-Protests.php| accessdate=2007-12-27|date=2007-08-06|work=[[International Herald Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Yams are peeled, sliced, cleaned, dried and then blended into a flour, also called ''elubo''. Yams are white in colour but turn brown when dried; this gives àmàlà its colour.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It could be served with a variety of [[soup|ọbẹ]] (soups), such as [[vegetable|ẹfọ]], [[okro|ilá]], [[ewedu|ewédú]], [[ogbono soup|ogbono]] or gbegiri ([[Black-eyed pea|black-eyed beans]] soup).

==Types==
There are two types of àmàlà: ''àmàlà isu'' and ''àmàlà láfún''.

===Yam flour (àmàlà isu)===
This is the most common type of àmàlà which is derived from yam. The particular yam specie best for preparing àmàlà is Dioscorea cayenensis because of its high starch content. [[Yam (vegetable)|Yam]], the common name for species in the genus ''Dioscorea'', grows in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Oceania, and Latin America, but 95% of it is cultivated and harvested in West Africa. Yam can be barbecued, roasted, fried, grilled, boiled, smoked, and grated. Àmàlà isu is made of dried yam; this gives it a black/brownish colour when added to boiling water. Amala is high in carbohydrates and packs a lot of calories.

===Cassava flour (àmàlà láfún)===
The second type is àmàlà láfún, made from cassava flour. [[Cassava]] is a woody shrub of the Euphorbiaceae (spurge) family. Cassava and yam are the most important source of food carbohydrate in Nigeria; Nigeria is the world's largest producer of cassava. Cassava flour when used as a dry powder makes àmàlà láfún. Fermented and flaky, it is called [[Garri]], another common dish, most often eaten by the [[Ijebu people]].

===Plantain flour (Amala ogede)===
Another type of Amala is ''elubo ogede'' (which is usually lighter in color). The low carbohydrate level in [[plantain flour]] makes it a good food for diabetics and others who need a low-carbohydrate food. Unripe plantain is peeled, dried, and grated into boiling water to become amala ogede, light brown in colour when cooked.

==Preparation==
The only ingredient needed when making àmàlà is boiling water and one of the types of flour. Once the water has come to a boil, the heat is reduced. The flour is added and stirred until all the water is absorbed. More hot water is added, then the dough is left to simmer for approximately five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Badiru, I.|author2=Badiru, D.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2013|title=Isi Cookbook: Collection of Easy Nigerian Recipes|publisher=iUniverse|location=Bloomington|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pDj5SB3KF8UC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the dough is kneaded until it has the desired texture. Kneading the dough into a smooth paste is the most difficult part of making àmàlà.

==Dishes==
Àmàlà can be eaten with various soups:
* [[Egusi]]: soup made of thickened melon seeds and leaf vegetables
* Ewedu soup: made from cooked and grated [[Corchorus]] leaves with or without a small quantity of egusi and/or locust beans.
* Okro soup: made from [[okra]]
* [[Efo riro]]: made from vegetables and a mixture of meat, fish, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rees, D.|author2=Farell, G.|author3=Orchard, J.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2012|title=Crop Post-Harvest: Science and Technology, Perishables|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken|page=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ogbono soup]]: made from ground ogbono seeds and a mixture of [[stock fish]] and [[Parkia biglobosa|locust beans]] added as garnish

'''Anarchist economics''' is the set of theories and practices of [[Economics|economic]] activity within the political philosophy of [[anarchism]]. With the exception of [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] who accept [[private ownership]] of the [[means of production]], anarchists are [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalists]].&lt;ref name="infoshop.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellerman 1992"/&gt; They argue that its characteristic institutions promote and reproduce various forms of economic activity which they consider oppressive, including [[private property]], [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] production relations, collecting [[Renting|rents]] from private property, taking a [[Profit (economics)|profit]] in exchanges and [[Usury|collecting interest on loans]].&lt;ref name="infoshop.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Igualada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellerman 1992"/&gt; They generally endorse [[Possession (law)|possession]]-based ownership rather than [[propertarianism]].&lt;ref name="proudhon395"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whatisanarchism"/&gt;

=== Early views ===
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]]]
[[File:Josiah Warren.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Josiah Warren]]]]
The early English anarchist [[William Godwin]]'s views on economics could be summarized as follows: "[H]e envisages the possibility of specialization in the various crafts, which would lead to a man's following the task for which he had the greatest aptitude, and distributing his surplus products to whoever may need them, receiving what he himself needs of other things from the surplus produced by his neighbours, but always on the basis of free distribution, not of exchange. It is evident that, despite his speculations on the future of machinery, Godwin's ideal society is based on the economics of handcrafts and cultivation".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1962"&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements''. 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

For the influential German [[individualist anarchist]] philosopher [[Max Stirner]], "[[private property]] is a spook which "lives by the grace of law" and it "becomes 'mine' only by effect of the law". In other words, private property exists purely "through the protection of the State, through the State's grace". Recognising its need for state protection, Stirner is also aware that "[i]t need not make any difference to the 'good citizens' who protects them and their principles, whether an absolute King or a constitutional one, a republic, if only they are protected. And what is their principle, whose protector they always 'love'? Not that of labour", rather it is "interest-bearing possession [...] labouring capital, therefore [...] labour certainly, yet little or none at all of one's own, but labour of capital and of the – subject labourers".&lt;ref name="Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin|url=http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG6 |title=G.6 What are the ideas of Max Stirner? in An Anarchist FAQ|publisher=Infoshop.org|date=|accessdate=2010-09-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123154932/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG6|archivedate=2010-11-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] was involved with the Lyons mutualists and later adopted the name to describe his own teachings.&lt;ref name="Woodcock, George p. 100"&gt;Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History Of Libertarian Ideas And Movements. Broadview Press. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; In ''What Is Mutualism?'', [[Clarence Lee Swartz]] gives his own account of the origin of the term, claiming that "[t]he word "[[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]" seems to have been first used by [[John Gray (19th century socialist)|John Gray]], an English writer, in 1832".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Swartz, Clarence Lee. What is Mutualism?&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests as well as the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few.

Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labour as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. He thus saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent and tax). He generally called the former "possession" and the latter "property". For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land.

[[Josiah Warren]] is widely regarded as the first [[Anarchism in the United States|American anarchist]]&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;Palmer, Brian (2010-12-29) [http://www.slate.com/id/2279457/ What do anarchists want from us?], ''[[Slate.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, ''The Peaceful Revolutionist'', was the first anarchist periodical published.&lt;ref name="bailie20"&gt;William Bailie, [http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/warren/1stAmAnarch.pdf ''Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist – A Sociological Study''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204155505/http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/warren/1stAmAnarch.pdf |date=February 4, 2012 }}, Boston: Small, Maynard &amp; Co., 1906, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Warren termed the phrase "[[Cost the limit of price]]", with "cost" here referring not to monetary price paid but the labor one exerted to produce an item.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;"A watch has a ''cost'' and a ''value''. The COST consists of the amount of labor bestowed on the mineral or natural wealth, in converting it into metals…". Warren, Josiah. ''Equitable Commerce''&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, "[h]e proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce".&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt;

Warren put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental "labor for labor store" called the [[Cincinnati Time Store]] where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor. The store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism. These included [[Utopia, Ohio|Utopia]] and [[past and present anarchist communities#Modern Times (1851 to late 1860s)|Modern Times]]. Warren said that [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]' ''The Science of Society'', published in 1852, was the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren's own theories.&lt;ref name="Charles A. Madison 1945 p. 53"&gt;Charles A. Madison. "Anarchism in the United States". ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 6, No. 1. (January 1945), p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, an early [[Anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]] was [[Joseph Déjacque]], the first person to describe himself as "[[Libertarianism|libertarian]]".&lt;ref name="Dejacque"&gt;Joseph Déjacque, [http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle – Lettre à P.J. Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike and against Proudhon, he argued that "it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature".&lt;ref name="Graham-2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="joseph.dejacque.free.fr"&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/libertaire/n06/lib01.htm "l'Echange"], article in ''Le Libertaire'' no 6, September 21, 1858, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alain Pengam. Anarchist-Communism"&gt;Déjacque criticized French [[Mutualism (economy)|mutualist]] anarchist [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]] as far as "the Proudhonist version of [[Ricardian socialism]], centred on the reward of labour power and the problem of exchange value. In his polemic with Proudhon on women's emancipation, Déjacque urged Proudhon to push on ‘as far as the abolition of the contract, the abolition not only of the sword and of capital, but of property and authority in all their forms,’ and refuted the commercial and wages logic of the demand for a ‘fair reward’ for ‘labour’ (labour power). Déjacque asked: ‘Am I thus... right to want, as with the system of contracts, to measure out to each – according to their accidental capacity to produce – what they are entitled to?’ The answer given by Déjacque to this question is unambiguous: ‘it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.’ [...] For Déjacque, on the other hand, the communal state of affairs – the phalanstery ‘without any hierarchy, without any authority’ except that of the ‘statistics book’ – corresponded to ‘natural exchange,’ i.e. to the ‘unlimited freedom of all production and consumption; the abolition of any sign of agricultural, individual, artistic or scientific property; the destruction of any individual holding of the products of work; the demonarchisation and the demonetarisation of manual and intellectual capital as well as capital in instruments, commerce and buildings."[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Alain_Pengam__Anarchist-Communism.html#toc2 Alain Pengam. "Anarchist-Communism"]&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to New York, he was able to serialise his book in his periodical ''Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement social''. Published in twenty-seven issues from 9 June 1858 to 4 February 1861, ''Le Libertaire'' was the first anarcho-communist journal published in the United States.

The [[anti-authoritarian]] sections of the [[First International]] proclaimed at the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier Congress]] (1872) that "the aspirations of the proletariat can have no purpose other than the establishment of an absolutely free economic organization and federation, founded upon the labour and equality of all and absolutely independent of all political government" in which each worker will have the "right to the enjoyment of the gross product of his labours and thereby the means of developing his full intellectual, material and moral powers in a collective setting". This revolutionary transformation could "only be the outcome of the spontaneous action of the [[proletariat]] itself, its trades bodies and the autonomous communes".&lt;ref name="blackrosebooks.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm |title=Table Of Contents |publisher=Blackrosebooks.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organization. [[Karl Marx]] became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the mutualists, opposed Marx's [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dodson | first = Edward | title = The Discovery of First Principles: Volume 2 | publisher = Authorhouse | page=312 | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-595-24912-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |ref=harv | location = London | year = 1985 | isbn = 0-7102-0685-2 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the [[League of Peace and Freedom]] (LPF), Russian revolutionary [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his [[collectivist anarchism|collectivist anarchist]] associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul | location = London | year = 1980 | isbn = 0-7102-0685-2 |page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allied themselves with the [[federalist]] socialist sections of the International,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bak | first = Jǹos | title = Liberty and Socialism | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-8476-7680-3 |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the [[State (polity)|state]] and the [[collectivization]] of property. A similar position was adopted by the [[Workers' Federation of the Spanish Region]] in 1882 as articulated by anarchist veteran of the First International [[Josep Llunas i Pujals]] in his essay, "Collectivism".&lt;ref name="blackrosebooks.net"/&gt; The collectivist anarchists advocated remuneration for the type and amount of labor adhering to the principle "to each according to deeds".&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, Peter. The Wages System. 1920. Also available: http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/kropotkin-peter/1920/wage.htm quote: "Such, in a few words, is the organization which the Collectivists desire ... their principles are: collective property in the instruments of labor and remuneration of each worker according to the time spent in productive toil, taking into account the productiveness of his work."&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-communism as a coherent, modern economic-political philosophy was first formulated in the Italian section of the First International by [[Carlo Cafiero]], [[Emilio Covelli]], [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Andrea Costa]] and other ex [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzinian]] [[Republicanism|republicans]].&lt;ref name="Nunzio Pernicone pp. 111–13"/&gt; Out of respect for Mikhail Bakunin, they did not make their differences with collectivist anarchism explicit until after Bakunin's death.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;James Guillaume, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/bakunin.htm "Michael Bakunin – A Biographical Sketch"]&lt;/ref&gt; The collectivist anarchists sought to collectivize ownership of the [[means of production]] while retaining [[payment]] proportional to the amount and kind of labor of each individual, but the anarcho-communists sought to extend the concept of [[collective ownership]] to the products of labor as well. While both groups argued against [[capitalism]], the anarcho-communists departed from Proudhon and Bakunin, who maintained that individuals have a right to the product of their individual labor and to be remunerated for their particular contribution to production. As Errico Malatesta put it, "instead of running the risk of making a confusion in trying to distinguish what you and I each do, let us all work and put everything in common. In this way each will give to society all that his strength permits until enough is produced for every one; and each will take all that he needs, limiting his needs only in those things of which there is not yet plenty for every one".&lt;ref name="dwardmac.pitzer.edu"&gt;Malatesta, Errico. A Talk About Anarchist Communism Between Two Workers. Also available at: http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_Archives/malatesta/MalatestaATAC.html&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1880s, most of the European anarchist movement had adopted an anarcho-communist position, advocating the abolition of [[wage labour]] and [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|distribution according to need]]. Ironically, the "collectivist" label then became more commonly associated with [[Marxism|Marxist]] state socialists who advocated the retention of some sort of [[wage system]] during the transition to full [[communism]]. Anarcho-communist [[Peter Kropotkin]] attacked this position in his essay, "The Collectivist Wages System", which was reprinted in his book ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' in 1892. Cafiero explains in ''[[Anarchy and Communism]]'' (1880) that private property in the product of labor will lead to unequal [[accumulation of capital]] and therefore the reappearance of [[social class]]es and their antagonisms; and thus the resurrection of the state: "If we preserve the individual appropriation of the products of labour, we would be forced to preserve money, leaving more or less accumulation of wealth according to more or less merit rather than need of individuals".&lt;ref name="Graham-2005"&gt;Robert Graham, ''Anarchism – A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas – Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300CE to 1939)'', Black Rose Books, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; At the Florence Conference of the Italian Federation of the International in 1876, held in a forest outside [[Florence]] due to [[police]] activity, they declared the principles of anarcho-communism.

=== Anarchism economics in practice: the Spanish Revolution ===
{{main|Spanish Revolution of 1936|Anarchist Catalonia}}
In the strong [[anarchism in Spain|anarchist movement in Spain]], the debate between collectivism and anarcho-communism was revived: "This double base, both industrial and rural, had turned the [[libertarian communism]] of Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalism]] in somewhat divergent directions, the one communalist, the other syndicalist. The communalism was expressed in a more local, more rural spirit, one might almost say: more southern, for one of its principal bastions was in [[Andalusia]]. Syndicalism, on the other hand, was more urban and unitarian in spirit – more northerly, too, since its main center was [[Catalonia]]".&lt;ref name="libcom1970"&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/anarchism-daniel-guerin-3c ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice''] by [[Daniel Guérin]]. Monthly Review Press. 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish anarchist theoreticians were somewhat divided on this subject. A section of them had given their hearts to Peter Kropotkin and his erudite yet simplistic idealization of the [[commune]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] which they identified with the Spanish tradition of the primitive peasant community. Their favorite slogan was the "free commune". Mikhail Bakunin was the founder of the Spanish collectivist, syndicalist and internationalist workers' movement. Those anarchists tended to follow him and his disciple [[Ricardo Mella]].&lt;ref name="libcom1970"/&gt; They were concerned with economic unification and believed that a long transitional period would be necessary during which it would be wiser to reward labor according to the hours worked and not according to need. They envisaged the economic structure of the future as a combination of local trade-union groupings and federations of branches of industry.&lt;ref name="libcom1970"/&gt;&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Diego Abad de Santillán.jpg|thumb|[[Diego Abad de Santillán]], [[Spanish anarchist]] economist whose views were influential during the Spanish Revolution of 1936]] --&gt;

In 1932, the Spanish anarchist theoretician [[Isaac Puente]] published an outline of anarcho-communism and its ideas were taken up by the Saragossa congress of the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] in May 1936.&lt;ref name="libcom1970"/&gt; The Spanish anarchist economist [[Diego Abad de Santillan]] published an influential treatise on economics, ''El Organismo Economico de la Revolucion'' (''The Economic Organization of the Revolution'').&lt;ref name="libcom1970"/&gt; He saw the following:
:Our ideal is the commune which is associated, federated, integrated into the total economy of the country, and of other countries in a state of revolution." To replace the single owner by a hydra-headed owner is not collectivism, is not self-management. The land, the factories, the mines, the means of transport are the product of the work of all and must be at the service of all. Nowadays the economy is neither local, nor even national, but world-wide. The characteristic feature of modern life is the cohesion of all the productive and distributive forces. "A socialized economy, directed and planned, is an imperative necessity and corresponds to the trend of development of the modern economic world.&lt;ref name="libcom1970"/&gt;

Santillan was to play an important part in the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]]. He became a member of the central committee of the anti-fascist militia, a member of the Catalan Economic Council and Economics Minister of the Catalan government.&lt;ref name="libcom1970"/&gt;

Anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] reports the following: "For several months the armed forces in these regions were mostly anarchist controlled militia units. The factories were largely taken over by the workers and run by C.N.T. committees, while hundreds of villages either shared out or collectivized the land, and many of them attempted to set up libertarian communes of the kind advocated by Kropotkin".
:The beginnings of collectivization seem to have been similar in villages and factories. The landlords in the villages had fled, the Civil Guards had been killed or chased away, and the village syndicate would transform itself into a popular assembly in which every villager could participate directly in the affairs of the community. An administrative committee would be elected, but this would operate under the constant supervision of the population, meeting at least once a week in full assembly to hasten the achievement of free communism. In the factories the process was similar, with a workers' committee becoming responsible to the general assembly of the syndicate, and technicians (in a few cases the former owners or managers) planning production in accordance with the workers' views.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1962"/&gt;

== Theoretical economic systems ==
=== Classical theoretical economic systems ===
In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical—those created throughout the 19th century—and post-classical anarchist schools–those created since the mid-20th century and after.

==== Mutualism ====
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with [[trade]] representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mutualist.org/ |title=Introduction |publisher=Mutualist.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David. 1987. "Mutualism." The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism is based on a [[labor theory of value]] which holds that when labor or its product is sold, in exchange it ought to receive goods or services embodying "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility".&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''Voluntary Socialism'', chapter 6, paragraph 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mutualists believe that if the state did not intervene as a result of increased competition in the marketplace, individuals would receive no more income than that in proportion to the amount of labor they exert.&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''Voluntary Socialism'', chapter 6, paragraphs 9, 10 &amp; 22.&lt;br&gt;Carson, Kevin, 2004, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', chapter 2 (after Meek &amp; Oppenheimer).&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualists oppose the idea of individuals receiving an income through loans, investments and rent as they believe these individuals are not laboring. Some of them argue that if state intervention ceased, these types of incomes would disappear due to increased competition in capital.&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''Voluntary Socialism'', chapter 6, paragraph 19.&lt;br&gt;Carson, Kevin, 2004, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', chapter 2 (after Ricardo, Dobb &amp; Oppenheimer).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Proudhon opposed this type of income, he expressed: "[...] I never meant to [...] forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I believe that all these forms of human activity should remain free and optional for all".&lt;ref&gt;''Solution of the Social Problem'', 1848–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Insofar as they ensure the workers right to the full product of their labor, mutualists support [[Market (economics)|markets]] and private property in the product of labor. However, they argue for conditional titles to land, whose private ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called "possession").&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Clarence Lee. [http://www.panarchy.org/swartz/mutualism.6.html What is Mutualism? VI. Land and Rent]&lt;/ref&gt;

Proudhon's mutualism supports [[Worker cooperative|labor-owned cooperative firms]] and associations&lt;ref&gt;Hymans, E., ''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', pp. 190–91,&lt;br /&gt;Woodcock, George. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'', Broadview Press, 2004, pp. 110, 112&lt;/ref&gt; for "we need not hesitate, for we have no choice [...] it is necessary to form an ASSOCIATION among workers [...] because without that, they would remain related as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two [...] castes of masters and wage-workers, which is repugnant to a free and democratic society" and so "it becomes necessary for the workers to form themselves into democratic
societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism".&lt;ref&gt;''General Idea of the Revolution'', Pluto Press, pp. 215–16, 277&lt;/ref&gt; As for [[capital good]]s (man-made, non-land "[[means of production]]"), mutualist opinion differs on whether these should be commonly managed public assets or private property.

===== Evolution =====
As a term, "mutualism" has seen a variety of related uses. [[Charles Fourier]] first used the French term ''mutualisme'' in 1822,&lt;ref&gt;Fourier, Charles, ''Traité'' (1822), cited in Arthur E. Bestor, Jr., "The Evolution of the Socialist Vocabulary", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 9, No. 3 (Jun., 1948), 259–302.&lt;/ref&gt; although the reference was not to an economic system. The first use of the noun "mutualist" was in the ''New-Harmony Gazette'' by an American [[Robert Owen|Owenite]] in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;''New-Harmony Gazette'', I, 301–02 (14 June 1826) cited in Arthur E. Bestor, Jr., "The Evolution of the Socialist Vocabulary", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 9, No. 3 (Jun., 1948), 259–302.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1830s, a labor organization in Lyons, France called themselves the Mutuellists. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was involved with the Lyons mutualists and later adopted the name to describe his own teachings.&lt;ref name="Woodcock, George p. 100"/&gt;

In ''What Is Mutualism?'', [[Clarence Lee Swartz]] gives his own account of the origin of the term, claiming that "[t]he word "mutualism" seems to have been first used by [[John Gray (19th century socialist)|John Gray]], an English writer, in 1832".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; When John Gray's 1825 ''Lecture on Human Happiness'' was first published in the United States in 1826, the publishers appended the ''Preamble and Constitution of the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests'', located at Valley Forge. 1826 also saw the publication of the ''Constitution of the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests'' at [[Kendal, Ohio]].

By 1846, Proudhon was speaking of ''mutualité'' in his writings and used the term ''mutuellisme'' at least as early as 1848 in his "Programme Révolutionnaire". In 1850, [[William Batchelder Greene]] used the term "mutualism" to describe a mutual credit system similar to that of Proudhon. Also in 1850, the American newspaper ''The Spirit of the Age'', edited by William Henry Channing, published proposals for a "mutualist township" by Joshua King Ingalls&lt;ref&gt;Joshua King Ingalls, "A Practical Movement for Transition", Spirit of the Age, II, 13 (March 30, 1850), pp. 202–04.&lt;/ref&gt; and Albert Brisbane,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Brisbane, "The Mutualist Township", The Spirit of the Age, II, 12 (March 23, 1850), 179–83.;  II, 13 (March 30, 1850), 200–02.&lt;/ref&gt; together with works by Proudhon,&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, "The Coming Era of Mutualism", ''Spirit of the Age'', I, 7 (August 18, 1849), 107–08.&lt;/ref&gt; Greene, [[Pierre Leroux]] and others.

For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, "[i]t is apparent...that [[Proudhonian]] Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the [[Individualist anarchism|Individualist Anarchism]] of Josiah Warren and [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]...William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form".&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"&gt;[http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html ''Native American Anarchism: A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism'' by Eunice Minette Schuster] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213201445/http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html |date=February 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Benjamin Tucker]] fused Max Stirner's [[Egoist anarchism|egoism]] with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''. Mutualism has been associated with two types of currency reform. [[Labor notes (currency)|Labor notes]] were first discussed in Owenite circles and received their first practical test in 1827 in the Time Store of former [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] member and individualist anarchist Josiah Warren. Mutual banking aimed at the monetization of all forms of wealth and the extension of free credit. It is most closely associated with William Batchelder Greene, but Greene drew from the work of Proudhon, [[Edward Kellogg (economist)|Edward Kellogg]] and William Beck as well as from the land bank tradition.

Mutualists argue that [[Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|association]] is only necessary where there is an organic combination of forces. For instance, an operation that requires specialization and many different workers performing their individual tasks to complete a unified product, i.e. a factory. In this situation, workers are inherently dependent on each other; and without association, they are related as subordinate and superior, master and wage-slave. An operation that can be performed by an individual without the help of specialized workers does not require association. Proudhon argued that peasants do not require societal form, and only feigned association for the purposes of solidarity in abolishing rents, buying clubs, etc.

Mutualists argue that [[free banking]] should be taken back by the people to establish systems of free credit. They contend that banks have a monopoly on credit, just as capitalists have a monopoly on land. [[Kevin Carson]] is a contemporary mutualist and author of ''[[Studies in Mutualist Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html Kevin Carson] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v8wrbTrn?url=http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html|date=2010-12-21}}. ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Carson holds that capitalism{{Ref|capitalism}} has been founded on "an act of robbery as massive as feudalism" and argues that capitalism could not exist in the absence of a state. He says that "[i]t is state intervention that distinguishes capitalism from the free market".&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Kevin.

Steven Vincent notes in his in-depth analysis of this aspect of Proudhon's ideas that "Proudhon consistently advanced a program of industrial democracy which would return control and direction of the economy to the workers". For Proudhon, "strong workers' associations [...] would enable the workers to determine jointly by election how the enterprise was to be directed and operated on a day-to-day basis".&lt;ref&gt;''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican Socialism'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1984, pp. 156, 230&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Collectivist anarchism ====
{{main|Collectivist anarchism}}
Collectivist anarchism (also known as anarcho-collectivism) is a revolutionary&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"&gt;Patsouras, Louis. 2005. Marx in Context. iUniverse. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; doctrine that advocates the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]] and private ownership of the [[means of production]]. Instead, it envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. For the [[collectivization]] of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"/&gt; Once collectivization takes place, workers' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.&lt;ref&gt;Bakunin Mikail. Bakunin on Anarchism. Black Rose Books. 1980. p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;

This contrasts with anarcho-communism, where wages would be abolished and where individuals would take freely from a storehouse of goods "to each according to his need". Notwithstanding the title, Mikhail Bakunin's collectivist anarchism is thus seen as a blend of [[individualism]] and [[collectivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Morriss, Brian. Bakukunin: The Philosophy of Freedom. Black Rose Books Ltd., 1993. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchism is most commonly associated with Bakunin, the [[anti-authoritarian]] sections of the First International and the early Spanish anarchist movement.

===== Criticism of Marxism and relationship with other anarchist classical currents =====
The collectivist anarchists at first used the term "collectivism" to distinguish themselves from the mutualism of the followers of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the state socialists associated with [[Karl Marx]]. Mikhail Bakunin wrote that "we shall always protest against anything that may in any way resemble communism or state socialism", which Bakunin regarded as fundamentally authoritarian ("Federalism, Socialism, and Anti-Theologism", 1867).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/various/reasons-of-state.htm|title=Federalism, Socialism, Anti-Theologism by Michael Bakunin|first=Mikhail|last=Bakunin|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute between Bakunin and Marx highlighted the differences between anarchism and [[Marxism]]. Bakunin argued—against certain ideas of a number of Marxists—that not all revolutions need be violent. He also strongly rejected Marx's concept of the "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]", a concept that [[Vanguardism|vanguardist socialism]] including [[Marxism–Leninism]] would use to justify [[one-party rule]] from above by a party claiming to represent the [[proletariat]].&lt;ref name=GW158&gt;Woodcock, George (1962, 1975). ''Anarchism'', 158. Harmondsworth, England: Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-020622-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin insisted that revolutions must be led by the people directly while any "enlightened elite" must only exert influence by remaining "[[invisible dictatorship|invisible]]...not imposed on anyone...[and] deprived of all official rights and significance".&lt;ref name="Struggle.ws"&gt;{{citation|url=http://struggle.ws/anarchism/writers/anarcho/anarchism/bakunindictator.html |title=Was Bakunin a secret authoritarian? |publisher=Struggle.ws |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held that the state should be immediately abolished because all forms of government eventually lead to oppression.&lt;ref name=GW158/&gt; Bakunin has sometimes been called the first theorist of the "[[new class]]", meaning that a class of intellectuals and bureaucrats running the state in the name of the people or the proletariat—but in reality in their own interests alone. Bakunin argued that the "[s]tate has always been the patrimony of some privileged class: a priestly class, an aristocratic class, a bourgeois class. And finally, when all the other classes have exhausted themselves, the State then becomes the patrimony of the bureaucratic class and then falls – or, if you will, rises – to the position of a machine".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Bakunin also had a different view as compared to Marx's on the revolutionary potential of the lumpenproletariat and the proletariat. As such, "[b]oth agreed that the proletariat would play a key role, but for Marx the proletariat was the exclusive, leading revolutionary agent while Bakunin entertained the possibility that the [[peasants]] and even the [[lumpenproletariat]] (the unemployed, common criminals, etc.) could rise to the occasion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://workerscompass.org/marxism-and-anarchism-the-philosophical-roots-of-the-marx-bakunin-conflict/|title=Marxism and Anarchism: The Philosophical Roots of the Marx-Bakunin Conflict - WorkersCompass.org - Published by Workers Action|date=21 June 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin "considers workers' integration in capital as destructive of more primary revolutionary forces. For Bakunin, the revolutionary archetype is found in a peasant milieu (which is presented as having longstanding insurrectionary traditions, as well as a communist archetype in its current social form – the peasant commune) and amongst educated unemployed youth, assorted marginals from all classes, brigands, robbers, the impoverished masses, and those on the margins of society who have escaped, been excluded from, or not yet subsumed in the discipline of emerging industrial work...in short, all those whom Marx sought to include in the category of the lumpenproletariat".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/deleuze-marx-politics-nicholas-thoburn-3 Nicholas Thoburn. "The lumpenproletariat and the proletarian unnameable" in ''Deleuze, Marx and Politics'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International proclaimed at the St. Imier Congress (1872) that "the aspirations of the proletariat can have no purpose other than the establishment of an absolutely free economic organization and federation, founded upon the labour and equality of all and absolutely independent of all political government" in which each worker will have the "right to the enjoyment of the gross product of his labours and thereby the means of developing his full intellectual, material and moral powers in a collective setting". This revolutionary transformation could "only be the outcome of the spontaneous action of the proletariat itself, its trades bodies and the autonomous communes".&lt;ref name="blackrosebooks.net"/&gt; A similar position was adopted by the Workers' Federation of the Spanish Region in 1882 as articulated by anarchist veteran of the First International Jose Llunas Pujols in his essay, "Collectivism".&lt;ref name="blackrosebooks.net"/&gt;

The difference between collectivist anarchism and anarcho-communism is that collectivist anarchism stresses collective ownership of productive, subsistence and distributary property while anarcho-communist negates the concept of ownership in favor of usage or possession with productive means being a possession not owned by any individual or particular group.&lt;ref name="proudhon395"&gt;Proudhon. ''What is Property'', pp. 395–96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berkman, Alexander. ''The ABC of Anarchism'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-communists believe that subsistence, productive and distributive property should be common or social possessions while personal property should be private possessions.&lt;ref name="whatisanarchism"&gt;What is Anarchism?, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchists agree with this, but they disagree on the subject of remuneration—some collectivist anarchists, such as Mikhail Bakunin, believe in the remuneration of labor while anarcho-communists such as Peter Kropotkin believe that such remuneration would lead to the recreation of currency and that this would need a state.&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin. ''Kropotkin's Revolutionary Pamphlets'', p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it could be said that collectivist anarchists believe in freedom through collective ownership of production and a communal market of sorts to distribute goods and services and compensate workers in the form of remuneration. Collectivist anarchism could be seen as a combination of communism and mutualism.

The ''[[An Anarchist FAQ|Anarchist FAQ]]'' compares and contrasts collectivist anarchism with communist anarchism this way: {{quote|The major difference between collectivists and communists is over the question of "money" after a revolution. Anarcho-communists consider the abolition of money to be essential, while anarcho-collectivists consider the end of private ownership of the means of production to be the key. As Kropotkin noted, "[collectivist anarchism] express[es] a state of things in which all necessaries for production are owned in common by the labour groups and the free communes, while the ways of retribution [i.e. distribution] of labour, communist or otherwise, would be settled by each group for itself."&lt;ref&gt;[Anarchism, p. 295]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while communism and collectivism both organise production in common via producers' associations, they differ in how the goods produced will be distributed. Communism is based on free consumption of all while collectivism is more likely to be based on the distribution of goods according to the labour contributed. However, most anarcho-collectivists think that, over time, as productivity increases and the sense of community becomes stronger, money will disappear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secA3.html%23seca32&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:42:45 A.3 What types of anarchism are there?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The abolition of [[wage labor]] is central to anarchist communism. With distribution of wealth being based on self-determined needs, people would be free to engage in whatever activities they found most fulfilling and would no longer have to engage in work for which they have neither the temperament nor the aptitude.&lt;ref name="BrownWork"/&gt; Anarcho-communists argue that there is no valid way of measuring the value of any one person's economic contributions because all wealth is a collective product of current and preceding generations.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Berkman. [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Alexander_Berkman__What_Is_Communist_Anarchism_.html#toc24  ''What Is Communist Anarchism?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-communists argue that any economic system based on wage labor and private property requires a coercive state apparatus to enforce [[property rights]] and to maintain unequal economic relationships that inevitably arise from differences in wages or amount of property. They further argue that markets and systems of currency divide labor into classes and assign arbitrary numerical values to an individual's work and attempt to regulate production, consumption and distribution. They argue that money restricts an individual's ability to consume the products of their labor by limiting their intake with prices and wages.

Anarcho-communists recognize money as fundamentally quantitative in nature, rather than qualitative. They believe production should be a qualitative matter and that consumption and distribution should be self-determined by each individual without arbitrary value assigned to labor, goods and services by others. In place of a market, most anarcho-communists support a [[currency]]-less [[gift economy]] where goods and services are produced by workers and distributed in community stores where everyone (including the workers who produced them) is essentially entitled to consume whatever they want or need as "payment" for their production of goods and services.

A gift economy does not necessarily involve an immediate return (such as with remuneration) as compensation comes in the form of whatever the person decides is of equal value to their products of labor (what is commonly called [[barter]]ing). Any limits on production and distribution would be determined by the individuals within the groups involved, rather than by capitalist owners, corporations, investors, banks or other artificial market pressures. Crucially, the abstract relationship of "landlord" and "tenant" would no longer exist as such titles are held to occur under conditional legal coercion and are not absolutely necessary to occupy buildings or spaces ([[intellectual property]] rights would also cease since they are a form of private property).

===== Evolution and role in early 20th century revolutions =====
Anarcho-communism developed out of radical [[Socialism|socialist]] currents after the [[French Revolution]],&lt;ref name="Graham-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__The_Great_French_Revolution_1789-1793.html#toc42 "Chapter 41: The "Anarchists"" in ''The Great French Revolution 1789–1793'' by Peter Kropotkin]&lt;/ref&gt; but it was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the [[First International]].&lt;ref name="Nunzio Pernicone pp. 111–13"&gt;Nunzio Pernicone, "Italian Anarchism 1864–1892", pp. 111–13, AK Press 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; An early anarcho-communist was [[Joseph Déjacque]], the first person to describe himself as "[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]".&lt;ref name="Dejacque"/&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that "it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature".&lt;ref name="Graham-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="joseph.dejacque.free.fr"/&gt;

Anarcho-communism as a coherent, modern economic-political philosophy was first formulated in the Italian section of the [[First International]] by [[Carlo Cafiero]], [[Emilio Covelli]], Errico Malatesta, [[Andrea Costa]] and other ex Mazzinian republicans.&lt;ref name="Nunzio Pernicone pp. 111–13"/&gt; Out of respect for Mikhail Bakunin, they did not make their differences with collectivist anarchism explicit until after Bakunin's death.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt; The collectivist anarchists sought to collectivize ownership of the means of production while retaining payment proportional to the amount and kind of labor of each individual, but the anarcho-communists sought to extend the concept of collective ownership to the products of labor as well.

While both groups argued against capitalism, the anarchist communists departed from Proudhon and Bakunin, who maintained that individuals have a right to the product of their individual labor and to be remunerated for their particular contribution to production. As Malatesta put it, "instead of running the risk of making a confusion in trying to distinguish what you and I each do, let us all work and put everything in common. In this way each will give to society all that his strength permits until enough is produced for every one; and each will take all that he needs, limiting his needs only in those things of which there is not yet plenty for every one".&lt;ref name="dwardmac.pitzer.edu"/&gt; The theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organizationalist and [[Insurrectionary anarchism|insurrectionary anti-organizationalist]] sections.&lt;ref name=" Alain Pengam"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pengam|first=Alain|title=Anarchist-Communism|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alain-pengam-anarchist-communism|publisher=The Anarchist Library|accessdate=6 June 2012|date=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Russian Revolution]], anarchists such as [[Nestor Makhno]] worked to create and defend—through the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]—anarcho-communism in the [[Free Territory]] of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the [[Bolsheviks]] in 1921. A commander of the peasant [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]], also known as the Anarchist Black Army, Makhno led a [[guerrilla]] campaign opposing both the Bolshevik "Reds" and monarchist "Whites".

In the [[Mexican Revolution]], the [[Mexican Liberal Party]] was established and during the early 1910s led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in [[Baja California]] with the leadership of anarcho-communist [[Ricardo Flores Magón]].&lt;ref name="sandiegohistory.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/99winter/magonista.htm|title="The Magonista Revolt in Baja California Capitalist Conspiracy or Rebelion de los Pobres?"  by Lawrence D.

=== Post-classical theoretical economic systems ===
==== Participatory economics ====
{{main|Parecon}}
[[File:NLN Michael Albert.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Albert]], [[Contemporary anarchism|contemporary anarchist]] economist proponent of the [[parecon]] system]]
Participatory economics, often abbreviated parecon, is an [[economic system]] proposed by activist and political theorist [[Michael Albert]] and radical economist [[Robin Hahnel]]. For Albert, "participatory economics and participatory society provide a worthy, viable, and even necessary and potentially sufficient anarchist revolutionary vision".&lt;ref&gt;"Porous Borders of Anarchist Vision and Strategy" by Michael Albert in ''[http://www.akpress.org/accumulationoffreedom.html The Accumulation of Freedom: Writings on Anarchist Economics.]'' AK Press. (2012), p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; It uses [[participation (decision making)|participatory decision making]] as an [[economics|economic mechanism]] to guide the production, [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] and allocation of [[factors of production|resources]] in a given society. Proposed as an alternative to contemporary capitalist [[market economy|market economies]] and also an alternative to [[planned economy|centrally planned]] [[socialism]], it is described as "an anarchistic economic vision"&lt;ref&gt;Albert, Michael [http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/Chapte19.htm Parecon: Life After Capitalism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016053719/http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/Chapte19.htm |date=October 16, 2008 }} Chapter 19 Individuals / Society&lt;/ref&gt; and it could be considered a form of socialism as under parecon the means of production are owned by the workers.

The underlying values that parecon seeks to implement are [[Equity (economics)|equity]], [[social solidarity|solidarity]], diversity, [[workers' self-management]] and efficiency (efficiency here means accomplishing goals without wasting valued assets). It proposes to attain these ends mainly through the following principles and institutions:
* [[Workers' council|Workers']] and consumers' councils utilizing self-managerial methods for decision making
* [[Balanced job complex]]es
* [[Remuneration]] according to effort and sacrifice
* [[Parecon#Participatory planning|Participatory planning]]

Albert and Hahnel stress that parecon is only meant to address an alternative economic theory and must be accompanied by equally important alternative visions in the fields of [[politics]], [[culture]] and [[kinship]]. The authors have also discussed elements of anarchism in the field of politics, [[polyculturalism]] in the field of culture and [[feminism]] in the field of family and gender relations as being possible foundations for future alternative visions in these other spheres of society. [[Stephen R. Shalom]] has begun work on a participatory political vision he calls "[[participatory politics|parpolity]]".

==== Inclusive Democracy ====
{{main|Inclusive Democracy}}
According to the Inclusive Democracy (ID) project, economic democracy is the authority of [[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]] (community) in the economic sphere, which requires equal distribution of economic power. As with the case of [[direct democracy]], [[economic democracy]] today is only feasible at the level of the confederated demoi. It involves the ownership and control of the means of production by the demos. This is radically different from the two main forms of concentration of economic power: capitalist and "socialist" [[Economic growth|growth]] economy. It is also different from the various types of collectivist capitalism, such as [[workers' control]] and milder versions suggested by [[post-Keynesian]] [[Social democracy|social democrats]]. The demos therefore becomes the authentic unit of economic life.

The main characteristic of the proposed model, which also differentiates it from socialist planning models like parecon, is that it explicitly presupposes a stateless, moneyless and marketless economy that precludes private accumulation of wealth and the institutionalisation of privileges for some sections of society without relying on a mythical post-scarcity state of abundance, or sacrificing freedom of choice. The proposed system aims at satisfying the double aim of: (a) meeting the basic needs of all citizens—which requires that basic macro-economic decisions have to be made democratically; and (b) securing freedom of choice—which requires the individual to make important decisions affecting his/her own life (what work to do, what to consume and so on).

Therefore, the system consists of two basic elements: (1) democratic planning, which involves a feedback process between workplace assemblies, demotic assemblies and the confederal assembly; and (2) an artificial market using personal vouchers, which ensures [[choice|freedom of choice]], but it avoids the adverse effects of real markets. Although some have called this system "a form of money based on the labour theory of value",&lt;ref&gt;David Pepper, ''Modern Environmentalism'', Routledge, 1996, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; it is not a money model since vouchers cannot be used as a general medium of exchange and store of wealth.

Another distinguishing feature of ID is its distinction between basic and non-basic needs. Remuneration is according to need for basic needs and according to effort for non-basic needs. ID is based on the principle that meeting basic needs is a fundamental human right which is guaranteed to all who are in a physical condition to offer a minimal amount of work. By contrast, parecon guarantees that basic needs are satisfied only to the extent they are characterized public goods or are covered by compassion and by a guaranteed basic income for the unemployed and those who cannot work.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Albert, ''[http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/parefinal.htm Parecon: Life After Capitalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231141221/http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/parefinal.htm |date=2009-12-31 }}'', Verso Books, 2003, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

See Gary Chartier, "Advocates of Freed Markets Should Oppose Capitalism", "Free-Market Anti-Capitalism?" session, annual conference, [[Association of Private Enterprise Education]] (Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, April 13, 2010); Gary Chartier, [http://c4ss.org/content/1738 "Advocates of Freed Markets Should Embrace 'Anti-Capitalism'"]; Gary Chartier, [http://invisiblemolotov.wordpress.com/2009/09/12/socialist-ends-market-means/ ''Socialist Ends, Market Means: Five Essays''].

''The origins of Left Libertarianism''. Palgrave. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Carson–Long-style left-libertarianism is rooted in nineteenth-century [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and in the work of figures such as [[Thomas Hodgskin]] and the [[individualist anarchist]]s Benjamin Tucker and [[Lysander Spooner]]. While with notable exceptions market-oriented libertarians after Tucker tended to ally with the political right, relationships between such libertarians and the [[New Left]] thrived in the 1960s, laying the groundwork for modern left-wing market anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Roderick T.

They state: "This hierarchical control of wage labour has the effect of alienating workers from their own work, and so from themselves. Workers no longer govern themselves during work hours and so are no longer free".&lt;ref name="infoshop.org"/&gt; So this is why capitalism, "by treating labour as analogous to all other commodities denies the key distinction between labour and other "resources"—that is to say its inseparability from its bearer—labour, unlike other "property", is endowed with will and agency. Thus when one speaks of selling labour there is a necessary subjugation of will (hierarchy)... Creative, self-managed work is a source of pride and joy and part of what it means to be fully human. Wrenching control of work from the hands of the worker profoundly harms his or her mental and physical health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12|title="B.1.2 Is capitalism hierarchical?" by An Anarchist FAQ|publisher=|access-date=2014-04-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428084157/http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12|archive-date=2014-04-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also establish the following: {{quote|[...] capitalism itself was created by state violence and the destruction of traditional ways of life and social interaction was part of that task. From the start, bosses spent considerable time and energy combating attempts of working people to join together to resist the hierarchy they were subjected to and reassert human values. Such forms of free association between equals (such as trade unions) were combated, just as attempts to regulate the worse excesses of the system by democratic governments. Indeed, capitalists prefer centralised, elitist and/or authoritarian regimes precisely because they are sure to be outside of popular control (see section B.2.5). They are the only way that contractual relations based on market power could be enforced on an unwilling population. Capitalism was born under such states and as well as backing fascist movements, they made high profits in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Today many corporations "regularly do business with totalitarian and authoritarian regimes – again, because it is profitable to do so." Indeed, there is a "trend by US corporations to invest in" such countries... Perhaps unsurprisingly, as such regimes are best able to enforce the necessary conditions to commodify labour fully.&lt;ref name="infoshop.org"/&gt;}}

For the influential [[Individualist anarchism in Europe|German individualist anarchist]] philosopher [[Max Stirner]], "[[private property]] is a spook which "lives by the grace of law" and it "becomes 'mine' only by effect of the law". In other words, private property exists purely "through the protection of the State, through the State's grace". Recognising its need for state protection, Stirner is also aware that "[i]t need not make any difference to the 'good citizens' who protects them and their principles, whether an absolute King or a constitutional one, a republic, if only they are protected. And what is their principle, whose protector they always 'love'? Not that of labour", rather it is "interest-bearing possession [...] labouring capital, therefore [...] labour certainly, yet little or none at all of one's own, but labour of capital and of the – subject labourers".&lt;ref name="Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin"/&gt; [[French anarchist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests as well as the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. The Spanish individualist anarchist [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]] sees "capitalism is an effect of government; the disappearance of government means capitalism falls from its pedestal vertiginously...That which we call capitalism is not something else but a product of the State, within which the only thing that is being pushed forward is profit, good or badly acquired. And so to fight against capitalism is a pointless task, since be it [[State capitalism]] or Enterprise capitalism, as long as Government exists, exploiting capital will exist. The fight, but of consciousness, is against the State".&lt;ref name="Igualada"&gt;"el capitalismo es sólo el efecto del gobierno; desaparecido el gobierno, el capitalismo cae de su pedestal vertiginosamente...Lo que llamamos capitalismo no es otra cosa que el producto del Estado, dentro del cual lo único que se cultiva es la ganancia, bien o mal habida. Luchar, pues, contra el capitalismo es tarea inútil, porque sea Capitalismo de Estado o Capitalismo de Empresa, mientras el Gobierno exista, existirá el capital que explota. La lucha, pero de conciencias, es contra el Estado." [http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within anarchism there emerged a critique of [[wage slavery]] which refers to a situation perceived as quasi-[[voluntary slavery]],&lt;ref name="Ellerman 1992"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellerman|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where a person's [[livelihood]] depends on [[wage]]s, especially when the dependence is total and immediate.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave |publisher= [[Merriam Webster|merriam-webster.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wage%20slave |publisher= dictionary.com |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[connotation|negatively connoted]] term used to draw an analogy between [[slavery]] and [[wage labor]] by focusing on similarities between owning and [[employment|renting]] a person. The term "wage slavery" has been used to criticize [[economic exploitation]] and [[social stratification]], with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages, e.g. in [[sweatshops]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandel|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_KdrTfTxqvgC&amp;pg=PA184 184]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter as a lack of workers' self-management, fulfilling job choices and leisure in an economy.&lt;ref name="globetrotter.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con2.html |title=Conversation with Noam Chomsky |page=2|publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallgrimsdottir|Benoit|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spunk.org"&gt;{{cite web |title= The Bolsheviks and Workers Control, 1917–1921: The State and Counter-revolution |url= http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/russia/sp001861/bolintro.html |publisher= [[Spunk Library]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Libertarian socialists]] believe that if freedom is valued, then society must work towards a system in which individuals have the power to decide economic issues along with political issues. Libertarian socialists seek to replace unjustified authority with [[direct democracy]], voluntary federation and popular autonomy in all aspects of life,&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Austin, et al. 'Encyclopedia of Social Theory' Routledge (2006) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; including physical communities and economic enterprises. With the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], thinkers such as Proudhon and Marx elaborated the comparison between wage labor and slavery in the context of a critique of societal property not intended for active personal use,&lt;ref name="Proudhon 1890"&gt;{{Harvnb|Proudhon|1890}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marx 1863 c7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1969|loc=[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ch07.htm Chapter VII]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luddite]]s emphasized the [[dehumanization]] brought about by machines while later [[Emma Goldman]] famously denounced wage slavery by saying: "The only difference is that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldman|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0IF7CusxuMcC&amp;pg=PA283 283]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman believed that the economic system of capitalism was incompatible with human liberty. "The only demand that property recognizes", she wrote in ''Anarchism and Other Essays'', "is its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade".&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Emma. Anarchism and Other Essays. 3rd ed. 1917. New York: Dover Publications Inc., 1969., p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; She also argued that capitalism dehumanized workers, "turning the producer into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his master of steel and iron".&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Emma. Anarchism and Other Essays. 3rd ed. 1917. New York: Dover Publications Inc., 1969. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]] contends that there is little moral difference between chattel slavery and renting one's self to an owner or "wage slavery". He feels that it is an attack on personal integrity that undermines individual freedom. He holds that workers should own and control their workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con2.html |title=Conversation with Noam Chomsky, p. 2 of 5 |publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many libertarian socialists argue that large-scale voluntary associations should manage industrial manufacture while workers retain rights to the individual products of their labor.&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann, Albert S. 'A History of European Socialism' Yale University Press (1983) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they see a distinction between the concepts of "private property" and "[[Personal property|personal possession]]". Whereas "private property" grants an individual exclusive control over a thing whether it is in use or not and regardless of its productive capacity, "possession" grants no rights to things that are not in use.&lt;ref&gt;Ely, Richard et al. 'Property and Contract in Their Relations to the Distribution of Wealth' The Macmillan Company (1914)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to anarchist Benjamin Tucker's "big four" monopolies (land, money, tariffs and patents) that have emerged under capitalism, neo-mutualist economist Kevin Carson argues that the [[Sovereign state|state]] has also transferred wealth to the wealthy by subsidizing organizational centralization in the form of transportation and communication subsidies. He believes that Tucker overlooked this issue due to Tucker's focus on individual market transactions whereas Carson also focuses on organizational issues. The theoretical sections of ''[[Studies in Mutualist Political Economy]]'' are presented as an attempt to integrate [[marginalist]] critiques into the [[labor theory of value]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin A. Carson, ''[http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html Studies in Mutualist Political Economy] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v8wrbTrn?url=http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html |date=2010-12-21 }}'' chs. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt; Carson holds that "arising as a new class society directly from the old class society of the [[Middle Ages]], [capitalism] was founded on an act of robbery as massive as the earlier [[Feudalism|feudal]] conquest of the land. It has been sustained to the present by continual state intervention to protect its system of privilege without which its survival is unimaginable".&lt;ref name=Richman&gt;[[Sheldon Richman|Richman, Sheldon]], [http://www.amconmag.com/blog/libertarian-left/ Libertarian Left], ''[[The American Conservative]]'' (March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Carson coined the [[pejorative]] term "vulgar libertarianism", a phrase that describes the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of [[corporate capitalism]] and [[economic inequality]] (see [[economic liberalism]] and [[right-libertarianism]]). According to Carson, the term is derived from the phrase "vulgar political economy", which [[Karl Marx]] described as an economic order that "deliberately becomes increasingly apologetic and makes strenuous attempts to talk out of existence the ideas which contain the contradictions [existing in economic life]".&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Theories of Surplus Value, III'', p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics as anarchist strategy ===
{{main|Economic secession}}
Economic secession has been variously defined by sources. In its narrowest sense, it is abstention from the state's economic system—for instance by replacing the use of [[government]] money with barter, [[local exchange trading system]]s, or [[commodity money]] (such as [[gold]]). As such, "anarchists can often be found advocating for mass refusal and the withdrawal of our participation-sometimes in the form of [[general strike]]s; sometimes as in the case of the [[Illegalism|illegalists]], in the forms of direct expropriations – with the support and participation of social movements or not; sometimes in the forms of occupations and the taking of space; and still other times in advocating for creating alternatives to capitalist relations in the here and now; and so on".&lt;ref&gt;Various Authors. ''[http://www.akpress.org/accumulationoffreedom.html The Accumulation of Freedom: Writings on Anarchist Economics.]'' AK Press. (2012), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anarchists believe that it is not radical political activity that will transform society, but radical economic activity that will make true change.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Hallam, Roger (1995) ''Anarchist Economics: Building Successful Social Alternatives.''&lt;/ref&gt; They regard [[boycott]]s, [[consumer advocacy]] and [[class-action lawsuit|class action lawsuit]]s to be merely liberal actions that do not address the core problem which is capitalism itself. Italian anarcho-communist Errico Malatesta argued that "each victory, however small, gained by the workers against their exploiters, each decrease of profit, every bit of wealth taken from the individual owners and put at the disposal of all, shall be a progress – a forward step towards Anarchism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/errico-malatesta-towards-anarchism|title=Towards Anarchism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parecon|Participatory economics]] addresses the [[division of labor]] question by advocating [[balanced job complex]]es wherein all workers at a production facility share in all aspects of labor, i.e. everyone takes part in labor, management, maintenance and all related work to ensure equality and that skills are shared amongst workers. Some anarchists that changing personal consumption habits to minimize (or eliminate entirely) involvement in the prevailing capitalist economy is essential to practicing anarchism in their lives. Withdrawing from the system by living on scavenged, stolen, or scammed resources is often touted by individuals and groups influenced by the [[Situationist International|Situationists]] such as [[CrimethInc.]] as a viable means of survival and non-participation in the system.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Days of War, Nights of Love (book)|Days of War, Nights of Love]]'' (2001), Crimethinc.Workers Collective, {{ISBN|0-9709101-0-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anarchist value theory ===
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's mutualism&lt;ref&gt;"Thus, the classical solution of expressing the value of goods and services in terms of man hours, which was developed by the orthodox (political) economists of the time, was adopted by both Proudhon and Marx." http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/dn/vol6/takis_proudhon.htm   "Beyond Marx and Proudhon" by Takis Fotopoulos&lt;/ref&gt; and [[American individualist anarchists]] such as [[Josiah Warren]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Benjamin Tucker]]&lt;ref&gt;"The most basic difference is that the individualist anarchists rooted their ideas in the labour theory of value while the "anarcho"-capitalists favour mainstream marginalist theory." [http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG1 An Anarchist FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315000327/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG1 |date=2013-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted the [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[labor theory of value]] of [[classical economics]], but they used it to criticize capitalism—instead favoring a non-capitalist market system.&lt;ref&gt;"Like Proudhon, they desired a (libertarian) socialist system based on the market but without exploitation and which rested on possession rather than capitalist private property"{{cite web|url=http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315000327/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG1 |archivedate=2013-03-15 }} An Anarchist FAQ&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egoist anarchist]] Max Stirner did not adhere to anything close to the labor theory of value and affirmed that the only real base for possession is might over it.&lt;ref name="Stirner 248"&gt;"Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property." "What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing." He says, "I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!"Max Stirner, [[The Ego and His Own|The Ego and his Own]] p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectivist anarchism, as defended by [[Mikhail Bakunin]], defended a form of the labour theory of value when it advocated a system where "all necessaries for production are owned in common by the labour groups and the free communes...based on the distribution of goods according to the labour contributed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Darby Tillis |url=http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionA3 |title=An Anarchist FAQ |publisher=Infoshop.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123103313/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionA3 |archivedate=2010-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarcho-communism]], as defended by Peter Kropotkin and [[Errico Malatesta]], rejected the labor theory of value and exchange value itself, advocated a gift economy and to base distribution on need.&lt;ref&gt;"Communism is based on free consumption of all while collectivism is more likely to be based on the distribution of goods according to the labour contributed.

==== Ethics of pricing ====
{{main|Cost the limit of price}}
[[File:LaborNote.JPG|thumb|Sample labor for labor note for the [[Cincinnati Time Store]], scanned from ''Equitable Commerce'' (1846) by Josiah Warren]]
Josiah Warren termed the phrase "[[Cost the limit of price]]", with "cost" here referring not to monetary price paid but the labor one exerted to produce an item.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; This understanding of cost is congruent with that of the [[classical economics|classical economist]] [[Adam Smith]] who said: "The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it". However, Warren reached different conclusions as he believed that goods and services should trade according to how much labor was exerted to produce them and bring them to market, instead of according to how individuals believed them to be [[subjective theory of value|subjectively worth]]. Therefore, "[h]e proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce".&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt; To charge more labor for something that entailed less labor was "cannibalism", according to him.&lt;ref&gt;"If a priest is required to get a soul out of purgatory, he sets his price according to the value which the relatives set upon his prayers, instead of their cost to the priest. This, again, is cannibalism. The same amount of labor equally disagreeable, with equal wear and tear, performed by his customers, would be a just remuneration". Warren, Josiah. ''Equitable Commerce''&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he believed that trading according to "cost the limit of price" would promote increasing efficiency in an economy, as he explains in ''Equitable Commerce'': {{quote|text=If cost is made the limit of price, every one becomes interested in reducing COST, by bringing in all the economies, all the facilities to their aid. But, on the contrary, if cost does not govern the price, but every thing is priced at what it will bring, there are no such co-operating interests.

If I am to have my supply of flour at cost, then, any facility I can afford to the wheat grower, reduces the cost to me, and it does the same for all who have any portion of the wheat, I am promoting all their interests while pursuing my own...Now if the wheat were NOT TO BE SOLD TO us AT COST, but at "whatever it would bring" according to our necessities, then none of us would have any interest in affording facilities, repairing breaches, nor in any other way co-operating with the producer of it. The same motive would act in the production, preservation, and use of every thing."&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Josiah. ''Equitable Commerce''. pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental "labor for labor store" called the Cincinnati Time Store at the corner of 5th and Elm Streets in what is now downtown Cincinnati, where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor: "All the goods offered for sale in Warren's store were offered at the same price the merchant himself had paid for them, plus a small surcharge, in the neighborhood of 4 to 7 percent, to cover store overhead".&lt;ref name=Mises&gt;Riggenbach, Jeff (2011-02-25) [https://mises.org/daily/5067/Josiah-Warren-The-First-American-Anarchist Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist], ''[[Mises Institute]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism. These included [[Utopia, Ohio|Utopia]] and [[past and present anarchist communities#Modern Times (1851 to late 1860s)|Modern Times]]. Warren said that [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]' ''The Science of Society'', published in 1852, was the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren's own theories.&lt;ref name="Charles A. Madison 1945 p. 53"/&gt;

==== Energy credits ====
The theory that all values can be evaluated in terms of [[joules]]. In the same vein as the labor theory of value, this is an attempt to make a normative basis for value by accounting for [[embodied energy]]. Accounting for such a system would be vastly more complex than current or other theoretical currency systems because all energy output of workers and energy expenditure on goods/services must be tracked (something that is thought impossible and useless by many anarchists).

One group that has advocated a system using energy is the [[technocracy movement]] with a system based on [[energy accounting]] where energy is used to "buy" a product or service without being exchanged, so the effect is that products or services are distributed to the user without gain by the provider (who has the same amount of energy in his or her account regardless) so allegedly making profit impossible.

=== Workers issues and anarcho-syndicalism ===
{{main|Anarcho-syndicalism}}
Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism which focuses on the [[Labor rights|labour movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges Sorel in Stuart Isaacs &amp; Chris Sparks, ''Political Theorists in Context'' (Routledge, 2004), p. 248. {{ISBN|0-415-20126-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Syndicalisme'' is a French word, ultimately derived from the Greek, meaning "[[trade unionism]]"—hence, the "[[syndicalism]]" qualification. Syndicalism is an alternative [[co-operative economics|co-operative economic system]]. Adherents view it as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the [[State (polity)|state]] with a new society democratically self-managed by workers.

[[File:Manifestación CNT Bilbao.jpg|thumb|250px|2010 [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] demonstration of Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[trade union]] [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] in [[Bilbao]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]]]

The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are workers' [[wikt:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[direct action]] and [[workers' self-management]]. Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only [[direct action]]—that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position—will allow workers to liberate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations (the organizations that struggle against the wage system, which in anarcho-syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.

[[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''. The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries. The Spanish Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) played and still plays a major role in the Spanish [[labor movement]]. It was also an important force in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

Anarcho-syndicalists seek to abolish the wage system, regarding it as "[[wage slavery]]" and state or private ownership of the [[means of production]], which they believe lead to class divisions. Not all seek to abolish money per se. [[Ralph Chaplin]] states that "the ultimate aim of the General Strike as regards wages is to give to each producer the full product of his labor. The demand for better wages becomes revolutionary only when it is coupled with the demand that the exploitation of labor must cease".&lt;ref&gt;Chaplin, Ralph, 1933, ''The General Strike for Industrial Freedom'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, anarcho-syndicalists regard the state as a profoundly anti-worker institution. They view the primary purpose of the state as being the defence of private property and therefore of economic, social and political privilege, even when such defence denies its citizens the ability to enjoy material independence and the social autonomy which springs from it.&lt;ref&gt;''Anarchosyndicalism.net'': {{cite web |url=http://www.anarchosyndicalism.net/faq/1c.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618075029/http://www.anarchosyndicalism.net/faq/1c.htm |archivedate=2013-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to other bodies of thought ([[Marxism–Leninism]] being a prime example), anarcho-syndicalists deny that there can be any kind of [[workers' state]], or a state which acts in the interests of workers, as opposed to those of the rich and powerful. Reflecting the anarchist philosophy from which it draws its primary inspiration, anarcho-syndicalism holds to the idea that [[Power (philosophy)|power]] corrupts.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'': {{cite web |url=http://www.anarchosyndicalism.net/faq/1c.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618075029/http://www.anarchosyndicalism.net/faq/1c.htm |archivedate=2013-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although anarcho-syndicalism originated close to the beginning of the twentieth century, it remains a popular and active school of anarchism today and has many supporters as well as many currently active organizations. Anarcho-syndicalist trade unionists, being [[social anarchists]], vary in their points of view on anarchist economic arrangements from a [[collectivist anarchism]] type economic system to an [[anarcho-communist]] economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Iain Mckay |chapter=What types of anarchism are there? |chapterurl=http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA3.html |title=An Anarchist FAQ |publisher=[[AK Press]] |location=Stirling |year=2008 |isbn=1-902593-90-1 |oclc=182529204 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922025342/http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA3.html |archivedate=2008-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Concept of wage slavery ====
{{main|Wage slavery}}
Wage slavery refers to a situation perceived as quasi-[[voluntary slavery]],&lt;ref name="Ellerman 1992"/&gt; where a person's [[livelihood]] depends on [[wage]]s, especially when the dependence is total and immediate.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wage%20slave |publisher= [[dictionary.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[connotation|negatively connoted]] term used to draw an analogy between [[slavery]] and [[wage labor]] by focusing on similarities between owning and [[employment|renting]] a person. The term "wage slavery" has been used to criticize [[economic exploitation]] and [[social stratification]], with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages, e.g. in [[sweatshops]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandel|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_KdrTfTxqvgC&amp;pg=PA184 184]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter as a lack of workers' self-management, fulfilling job choices and leisure in an economy.&lt;ref name="globetrotter.berkeley.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spunk.org"/&gt; The criticism of social stratification covers a wider range of employment choices bound by the pressures of a [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]] society to perform otherwise unfulfilling work that deprives humans of their "species character"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Avineri|1968|p=142}}.&lt;/ref&gt; not only under threat of [[starvation]] or [[poverty]], but also of [[social stigma]] and [[Social status|status]] [[wikt:diminution|diminution]].&lt;ref name="Fitzhugh 1857"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitzhugh|1857}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schalkenbach1"&gt;{{Harvnb|George|1981|loc=[http://schalkenbach.org/library/henry-george/social-problems/sp15.html Chapter 15]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con2.html|title=Conversation with Noam Chomsky, p. 2 of 5|website=globetrotter.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Collectivizations and workers control ====
{{main|Revolutionary syndicalism|Workers' control|worker cooperative}}
[[File:Textil.jpg|thumb|200px|CNT poster informing about the [[Socialization (economics)|socialization]] of the textiles industry during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] of the 1930s]]
Workers' control is a term meaning participation in the management of factories and other commercial enterprises by the people who work there. It has been variously advocated by anarchists, [[Socialism|socialists]], [[Communism|communists]], [[Social democracy|social democrats]] and [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] and has been combined with various [[socialist economics|socialist]] and [[mixed economy]] systems. [[Workers' council]]s are a form of workers' control.

For Proudhon, [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] involved creating "industrial democracy", a system where workplaces would be "handed over to democratically organised workers' associations [...] We want these associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies woven into the common cloth of the democratic social Republic".&lt;ref&gt;Guerin, Daniel (ed.) ''No Gods, No Masters'', AK Press, vol. 1, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; He urged "workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism". This would result in "[c]apitalistic and proprietary exploitation, stopped everywhere, the wage system abolished, equal and just exchange guaranteed".&lt;ref&gt;''The General Idea of the Revolution'', Pluto Press, pp. 277,  281&lt;/ref&gt; Workers would no longer sell their labour to a capitalist but rather work for themselves in co-operatives.[[Council communism]], such as in the early Soviet Union advocated workers' control through workers councils and [[factory committee]]s. [[Syndicalism]] advocates workers' control through [[trade unions]]. [[Guild socialism]] advocates workers' control through a revival of the [[guild]] system. [[Participatory economics]] represents a recent variation on the idea of workers' control.

Workers' control can be contrasted to control of the economy via the state such as [[nationalisation]] and [[central planning]] (see [[state socialism]]) and private control of the means of production as found in capitalism. A worker cooperative is a [[cooperative]] owned and democratically managed by its worker-owners. This control may be exercised in a number of ways. A cooperative enterprise may mean a firm where every worker-owner participates in [[decision making]] in a democratic fashion, or it may refer to one in which managers and administration is elected by every worker-owner and finally it can refer to a situation in which managers are considered and treated as, workers of the firm.&lt;ref name="digitalcommons.shu.ac.uk"&gt;[http://digitalcommons.shu.ac.uk/ciod_papers/57/ Ridley-Duff, R. J. (2009) "Cooperative Social Enterprises: Company Rules, Access to Finance and Management Practice", ''Social Enterprise Journal'', 5(1), forthcoming]&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional forms of worker cooperative, all shares are held by the workforce with no outside or consumer owners and each member has one voting share. In practice, control by worker owners may be exercised through individual, collective or majority ownership by the workforce, or the retention of individual, collective or majority voting rights (exercised on a one-member one-vote basis).&lt;ref name="digitalcommons.shu.ac.uk"/&gt; A worker cooperative therefore has the characteristic that the majority of its workforce own shares, and the majority of shares are owned by the workforce.&lt;ref name="ICA"&gt;[http://www.cooperatives-uk.coop/live/images/cme_resources/Public/governance/Worker%20co-op%20governance/ICA.pdf ICA (2005) World Declaration on Worker Cooperatives, Approved by the ICA General Assembly in Cartagena, Colombia, 23 September 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, anarcho-communism has been critical of workers ownership of large means of production for the following reasons: "Whereas the syndicalist alternative re-privatizes the economy into "self-managed" collectives and opens the way to their degeneration into traditional forms of private property – whether "collectively" owned or not – [[libertarian municipalism]] politicizes the economy and dissolves it into the civic domain. Neither factory or land appear as separate interests within the communal collective. Nor can workers, farmers, technicians, engineers, professionals, and the like perpetuate their vocational identities as separate interests that exist apart from the citizen body in face-to-face assemblies. "Property" is integrated into the commune as a material constituent of its libertarian institutional framework, indeed as a part of a larger whole that is controlled by the citizen body in assembly as citizens – not as vocationally oriented interest groups".&lt;ref name=Bookchin /&gt;

=== Forms of exchange ===
Anarchist economist Kevin Carson manifests that "[l]ocal currencies, barter networks and mutual credit‐clearing systems are a solution to a basic problem: a world in which there is a lot of work to be done, but there is simply no money around to bring the people and the work together".&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Carson. ''The Homebrew Industrial Revolution: A Low‐Overhead Manifesto''. BOOSURGE. 2010. p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alternate currency ====
{{main|alternative currency}}
An alternative currency is any [[currency]] used as an alternative to the dominant national or multinational currency systems (usually referred to as national or [[Fiat currency|fiat money]]). Alternative currencies can be created by an individual, corporation, or organization, they can be created by national, state, or local governments, or they can arise naturally as people begin to use a certain commodity as a currency. [[Mutual credit]] is a form of alternative currency and thus any form of lending that does not go through the banking system can be considered a form of alternative currency.

When used in combination with or when designed to work in combination with national or multinational fiat currencies they can be referred to as [[complementary currency]]. Most complementary currencies are also [[local currency|local currencies]] and are limited to a certain region. Barters are another type of alternative currency. These are actually exchange systems, which only trade items; thus without the use of any currency whatsoever. Finally, [[local exchange trading system]] is a special form of barter which trades points for items. One point stands for one man-hour of work and often there are issues related to paying [[tax]]. Some alternative currencies are considered tax-exempt, but most of them are fully taxed as if they were national currency, with the caveat that the tax must be paid in the national currency. The legality and tax status of alternative currencies varies widely from country to country as some systems in use in some countries would be illegal in others.

==== Labor notes and local exchange trading systems ====
{{main|Labor notes (currency)|Local exchange trading system}}
Labour notes are an [[alternative currency]] based on exchange of hours of labor. Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist.&lt;ref name="Slate"/&gt; Josiah Warren termed the phrase "[[Cost the limit of price]]", with "cost" here referring not to monetary price paid but the labor one exerted to produce an item.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Therefore, "[h]e proposed a system to pay people with labour notes indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce".&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt;

He put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental "labor for labor store" called the Cincinnati Time Store where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor. The store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism. These included [[Utopia, Ohio|Utopia]] and [[past and present anarchist communities#Modern Times (1851 to late 1860s)|Modern Times]].

A local exchange trading system (also local employment and trading system or local energy transfer system; abbreviated to LETS or LETSystem) is a locally initiated, democratically organised, not-for-profit community enterprise that provides a community information service and record transactions of members exchanging goods and services by using the currency of locally created LETS Credits.&lt;ref name=trainingpack&gt;"LETSystems Training Pack", (1990) W.A. Government.&lt;/ref&gt; LETS networks use [[interest]]-free [[community-based economics|local]] [[credit (accounting)|credit]] so direct swaps do not need to be made. For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network. In LETS, unlike other [[local currency|local currencies]], no [[scrip]] is issued, but rather transactions are recorded in a central location open to all members. As credit is issued by the network members, for the benefit of the members themselves, LETS are considered [[mutual credit]] systems.

=== Credit and banking ===
{{main|Mutual credit|free banking}}
[[File:Wbg-masonicportrait.png|thumb|[[William Batchelder Greene]], [[Individualist anarchism in the United States|American individualist anarchist]] activist and theorist for [[free banking]]]]
Anarchist mutualists argued that free banking should be taken back by the people to establish systems of free credit. They contend that banks have a monopoly on credit, just as capitalists have a monopoly on land. Banks are essentially creating money by lending out deposits that do not actually belong to them, then charging interest on the difference. Mutualists argue that by establishing a democratically run [[mutual savings bank]] or [[credit union]], it would be possible to issue free credit so that money could be created for the benefit of the participants rather than for the benefit of the bankers. Individualist anarchists noted for their detailed views on mutualist banking include [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[William Batchelder Greene]] and [[Lysander Spooner]]. Some modern forms of mutual credit are LETS and the [[Ripple (payment protocol)|Ripple monetary system]] project.

In a session of the French legislature, Proudhon proposed a government-imposed [[income tax]] to fund his mutual banking scheme, with some tax brackets reaching as high as 33{{fraction|1|3}} percent and 50 percent, which was turned down by the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Edwin Robert. 1911. The Income Tax: A Study of the History, Theory and Practice of Income Taxation at Home and Abroad. The MacMillan Company. p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; This income tax Proudhon proposed to fund his bank was to be levied on rents, interest, debts and salaries.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Richard D. E. 1991. Baudelaire and the Second Republic: Writing and Revolution. Oxford University Press. p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corkran, John Frazer. 1849. History of the National Constituent Assembly, from May, 1848. Harper &amp; Brothers. p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Proudhon's proposed law would have required all capitalists and stockholders to disburse one sixth of their income to their tenants and debtors and another sixth to the national treasury to fund the bank.&lt;ref name="Martin, Henri p. 189"&gt;Martin, Henri, &amp; Alger, Abby Langdon. A Popular History of France from the First Revolution to the Present Time. D. Estes and C.E. Lauria. p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; This scheme was vehemently objected to by others in the legislature, including [[Frédéric Bastiat]];&lt;ref name="Martin, Henri p. 189"/&gt; the reason given for the income tax's rejection was that it would result in economic ruin and that it violated "the right of property".&lt;ref&gt;Augello, Massimo M., Luigi, Marco Enrico. 2005. Economists in Parliament in the Liberal Age. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; In his debates with Bastiat, Proudhon did once propose funding a national bank with a voluntary tax of 1%.&lt;ref&gt;"Suppose that all the producers in the republic, numbering more than ten millions, tax themselves, each one, to the amount of only one per cent of their capital. . . . Suppose that by means of this tax a bank be founded, in Competition with the Bank (miscalled) of France, discounting and giving credit on mortgages at the rate of one-half of one per cent." Henry Cohen, ed. ''Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem.'' Vanguard Press, 1927. pp 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon also argued for the abolition of all taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cohen, ed. ''Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem.'' Vanguard Press, 1927. p 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

American mutualist William Batchelder Greene is best known for the works ''Mutual Banking'', which proposed an interest-free banking system. In 1850 and 1851, he organized citizens of Brookfield, Warren and Ware, [[Massachusetts]] to petition the state's General Court for a charter to establish a [[mutual savings bank|mutual bank]]: "Upon all the petitions, the Committee on Banks and Banking, after hearing the arguments of the petitioners, reported simply, "Leave to withdraw!" (''The Radical Deficiency of the Existing Circulating Medium'' 1857). Similar attempts by the New England Labor Reform League in the 1870s met with similar results. Greene's mutualist banking ideas resembled those of Proudhon as well as the "land banks" of the colonial period. He had an important influence on Benjamin Tucker, the editor of the anarchist journal ''[[Liberty (1881-1908)|Liberty]]''.

During the episode known as the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]], contemporary anarchist theorist [[Peter Gelderloos]] reports the following: {{cquote|[...] For better or worse, the Spanish revolutionaries also experimented with Peasant Banks, Labor Banks, and Councils of Credit and Exchange. The Levant Federation of Peasant Collectives started a bank organized by the Bank Workers Union to help farmers draw from a broad pool of social resources needed for certain infrastructure- or resource-intensive types of farming. The Central Labor Bank of Barcelona moved credit from more prosperous collectives to socially useful collectives in need. Cash transactions were kept to a minimum, and credit was transferred as credit. The Labor Bank also arranged foreign exchange, and importation and purchase of raw materials. Where possible, payment was made in commodities, not in cash. The bank was not a for-profit enterprise; it charged only 1% interest to defray expenses. [[Diego Abad de Santillan]], the anarchist economist, said in 1936: "Credit will be a social function and not a private speculation or usury... Credit will be based on the economic possibilities of society and not on interests or profit... The Council of Credit and Exchange will be like a thermometer of the products and needs of the country."[52] In this experiment, money functioned as a symbol of social support and not as a symbol of ownership  –  it signified resources being transferred between unions of producers rather than investments by speculators. Within a complex industrial economy such banks make exchange and production more efficient, though they also present the risk of centralization or the reemergence of capital as a social force. Furthermore, efficient production and exchange as a value should be viewed with suspicion, at the least, by people interested in liberation. There are a number of methods that could prevent institutions such as labor banks from facilitating the return of capitalism, though unfortunately the onslaught of totalitarianism from both the fascists and Communists deprived Spanish anarchists of the chance to develop them. These might include rotating and mixing tasks to prevent the emergence of a new managing class, developing fragmented structures that cannot be controlled at a central or national level, promoting as much decentralization and simplicity as possible, and maintaining a firm tradition that common resources and instruments of social wealth are never for sale.|author=[[Peter Gelderloos]], ''Anarchy Works''&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gelderloos.

=== Gift economy ===
{{main|Gift economy}}

In anthropology and the social sciences, a gift economy (or gift culture) is a mode of exchange where valuable [[goods and services]] are regularly given without any explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards (i.e. no formal ''[[quid pro quo]]'' exists).&lt;ref name="Cheal "&gt;{{cite book |last=Cheal |first=David J |title=The Gift Economy |publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=1988|pages=1–19|chapter=1|isbn=0415006414|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o-wNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Cheal,+David+J.+%27The+Gift+Economy%27|accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, voluntary and recurring gift exchange circulates and redistributes wealth throughout a community and serves to build societal ties and obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Bollier, David. "The Stubborn Vitality of the Gift Economy." Silent Theft: The Private Plunder of Our Common Wealth. First Printing ed. New York: Routledge, 2002. 38–39. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to a [[barter economy]] or a [[market economy]], social norms and custom governs gift exchange, rather than an explicit exchange of goods or services for money or some other [[commodity]].&lt;ref name="R. Kranton"&gt;R. Kranton: ''Reciprocal exchange: a self-sustaining system'', American Economic Review, V. 86 (1996), Issue 4 (September), pp. 830–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional societies dominated by [[gift exchange]] were small in scale and geographically remote from each other. As states formed to regulate trade and commerce within their boundaries, market exchange came to dominate. Nonetheless, the practice of [[gift exchange]] continues to play an important role in modern society.&lt;ref name="Lewis Hyde"&gt;''Lewis Hyde: The Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property''&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent example is scientific research, which can be described as a gift economy.&lt;ref name="Warren Hagstrom"&gt;Hagstrom, Warren (1982). "Gift giving as an organizing principle in science". In Barry Barnes and David Edge. ''Science in Context: Readings in the Sociology of Science''. MIT Press (Cambridge, Massachusetts).&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to popular conception, there is no evidence that societies relied primarily on barter before using money for trade.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Mauss|Mauss, Marcel]]. 'The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies.' pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, non-monetary societies operated largely along the principles of gift economics and in more complex economies on [[debt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/08/what-is-debt-%E2%80%93-an-interview-with-economic-anthropologist-david-graeber.html|title=What is Debt? – An Interview with Economic Anthropologist David Graeber

'Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value'. pp. 153–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of the Internet has witnessed a resurgence of the gift economy, especially in the technology sector. Engineers, scientists and software developers create [[open-source software]] projects. The [[Linux kernel]] and the [[GNU]] operating system are prototypical examples for the gift economy's prominence in the technology sector and its active role in instating the use of [[Permissive free software licence|permissive free software]] and [[copyleft]] licenses, which allow free reuse of software and knowledge. Other examples include [[file-sharing]], [[the commons]] and [[open access]].

Anarcho-communists advocate a gift economy as an ideal, with neither money, nor markets, nor central planning. This view traces back at least to [[Peter Kropotkin]], who saw in the hunter-gatherer tribes he had visited the paradigm of "[[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1955 paperback (reprinted 2005), includes Kropotkin's 1914 preface, Foreword and Bibliography by Ashley Montagu, and The Struggle for Existence, by Thomas H. Huxley ed.). Boston: Extending Horizons Books, Porter Sargent Publishers. {{ISBN|0-87558-024-6}}. Project Gutenberg e-text, Project LibriVox audiobook&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist anthropologist [[David Graeber]] in his 2011 book ''[[Debt: The First 5000 Years]]'' argues that with the advent of the great [[Axial Age]] civilizations the nexus between coinage and the calculability of economic values was concomitant with the disrupt of what Graeber calls "human economies" as found among the [[Iroquois]], [[Celts]], [[Inuit]], [[Tiv people|Tiv]], [[Nuer people|Nuer]] and the [[Malagasy people]] of [[Madagascar]] among other groups, which according to Graeber held a radically different conception of debt and social relations based on the radical incalculability of human life and the constant creation and recreation of social bonds through gifts, marriages and general sociability.

The author postulates the growth of a "military-coinage-slave complex" around this time, through which mercenary armies looted cities and human beings were cut from their social context to work as slaves in Greece, Rome and elsewhere in the Eurasian continent. The extreme violence of the period marked by the rise of great empires in China, India and the Mediterranean was in this way connected with the advent of large-scale slavery and the use of coins to pay soldiers, together with the obligation enforced by the state for its subjects to pay its taxes in currency. This was also the same time that the great religions spread out and the general questions of philosophical enquiry emerged on world history—many of those directly related, as in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', with the nature of debt and its relation to ethics.

==== Free shops ====
{{main|Give away shop}}
[[File:Give away shop utrecht inside.jpg|thumb|250px|Inside [[Utrecht]] [[Giveaway shop]], where the banner reads: "The earth has enough for everyone's need, but not for everyone's greed"]]
Give-away shops, freeshops, or free stores are stores where all goods are free. They are similar to [[charity shop]]s, with mostly second-hand items—only everything is available at no cost. Whether it is a book, a piece of furniture, a garment or a household item, it is all freely given away, although some operate a one-in, one-out type policy (swap shops). The free store is a form of constructive [[direct action]] that provides a shopping alternative to a monetary framework, allowing people to exchange goods and services outside of a money-based economy.

The anarchist [[1960s counterculture|1960s countercultural]] group [[The Diggers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=John Campbell McMillian |author2=Paul Buhle |title=The new left revisited |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_Ohks41z2IC&amp;pg=PA112 |accessdate=28 December 2011 |year=2003 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-976-0 |pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened [[free stores]] which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.&lt;ref name="Lytle_2006_213215"&gt;{{harvnb|Lytle|2006|pp=213, 215}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Diggers took their name from the original [[Diggers|English Diggers]] led by [[Gerrard Winstanley]]&lt;ref name="Digger Archives"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diggers.org/overview.htm |title= Overview: who were (are) the Diggers? |accessdate=2007-06-17 | work=The Digger Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to create a mini-society free of money and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="American Experience doc"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Gail Dolgin]]; Vicente Franco|date=2007|title=American Experience: The Summer of Love|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/love/index.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2007-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although free stores have not been uncommon in the United States since the 1960s, the [[freegan]] movement has inspired the establishment of more free stores. Today the idea is kept alive by the new generations of [[social centres]], anarchists and environmentalists who view the idea as an intriguing way to raise awareness about [[consumer culture]] and to promote the [[reuse]] of commodities.

==== Peer-to-peer (P2P) ====
{{main|Infoanarchism|Digital commons (economics)|Social peer-to-peer processes|Knowledge commons}}
Peer-to-peer (P2P) is not restricted to technology, but covers every social process with a peer-to-peer dynamic, whether these peers are humans or computers. [[Peer-to-peer]] as a term originated from the popular concept of P2P distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. This application structure was popularized by [[file sharing]] systems like [[Napster]], the first of its kind in the late 1990s.

The concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. P2P human dynamic affords a critical look at current [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[centralization|centralized]] social structures. Peer-to-peer is also a political and social program for those who believe that in many cases, peer-to-peer modes are a preferable option. Anarchist scholar [[Uri Gordon]] has said that "the collaborative development of [[free software]] like the [[Linux]] operating system and applications such as [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]] clearly approximate an informational anarchist communism. Moreover, for anarchists it is precisely the logic of [[expropriation]] and [[Copyright infringement|electronic piracy]] that enables a radical political extension of the cultural ideals of the free manipulation, circulation and use of information associated with the "[[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] ethic" (Himanen 2001). The space of illegality created by [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P (peer-to-peer) file-sharing]] opens up the possibility, not only of the open circulation of freely-given information and software as it is on the Internet today, but also of conscious copyright violation. The Internet, then, enables not only communist relations around information, but also the militant contamination and erosion of non-communist regimes of knowledge—a technological "weapon" to equalise access to information, eating away at intellectual property rights by rendering them unenforceable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anarchism and Political Theory: Contemporary Problems|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/uri-gordon-anarchism-and-political-theory-contemporary-problems|author=[[Uri Gordon]]|publisher=The Anarchist Library|accessdate=Aug 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

P2P is a specific form of relational dynamic, based on the assumed [[equipotent|equipotency]] of its participants, organized through the free cooperation of equals in view of the performance of a common task, for the creation of a common good, with forms of decision-making and autonomy that are widely distributed throughout the network. There are three fundamental aspects of social P2P processes:

# [[Peer production]]: the collaborative production of use value is open to participation and use to the widest possible number (as defined by Yochai Benkler, in his essay Coase's Penguin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf |title=Coase's Penguin, or, Linux and The Nature of the Firm |first=Yochai |last=Benkler |publisher=The Yale Law Journal |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010152105/http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Peer governance: production or project is governed by the community of producers themselves, not by market allocation or corporate hierarchy.
# Peer property: the use-value of property is freely accessible on a universal basis; peer services and products are distributed through new modes of property, which are not exclusive, though recognize individual authorship (i.e. the [[GNU General Public License]] or the [[Creative Commons]] licenses).

Peer production does not produce commodities for exchange value, and does not use the [[price mechanism]] or [[corporate]] [[hierarchy]] to determine the allocation of resources. It must therefore be distinguished from both the [[capitalist]] [[Market (economics)|market]] (though it can be linked and embedded in the broader market) and from production through state and corporate planning; as a mode of [[governance]] it differs from traditional [[linear]] hierarchies; and as a mode of property it differs from both traditional private property and state-based collective [[public property]]; it is rather the common property of its producers and users and the whole of humankind. Unlike private property, peer property is inclusive rather than exclusive—its nature is to share ownership as widely, rather than as narrowly as possible.

While many anarcho-communists are opposed to trade, some post-left, post-scarcity anarcho-communists and ones with syndicalist sympathies are not opposed to trade. Some support a non-monetary form of trade in the form of post-monetary [[trade unions]] and [[commons]]. Others such as Tiziana Terranova easily see anarcho-communism being compatible with a non-hierarchical, open access, free association, post-monetary form of trade such as [[peer-to-peer (meme)|P2P]].&lt;ref&gt;Terranova, Tiziana [http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/technocapitalism/voluntary "Free Labor: Producing Culture for the Digital Economy"]. 07-26-2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coexistence of economic systems and economic pluralism ===
{{see also|Anarchism without adjectives}}
French [[anarchist without adjectives]] [[Max Nettlau]] addressed the issue of the coexistence of different economic systems as follows: {{quote|Let me imagine myself for a moment living in a free society. I should certainly have different occupations, manual and mental, requiring strength or skill. It would be very monotonous if the three or four groups with whom I would work (for I hope there will be no Syndicates then!) would be organized on exactly the same lines; I rather think that different degrees or forms of Communism will prevail in them. But might I not become tired of this, and wish for a spell of relative isolation, of Individualism? So I might turn to one of the many possible forms of "equal exchange" Individualism. Perhaps people will do one thing when they are young and another thing when they grow older. Those who are but indifferent workers may continue with their groups; those who are efficient will lose patience at always working with beginners and will go ahead by themselves, unless a very altruist disposition makes it a pleasure to them to act as teachers or advisers to younger people. I also think that at the beginning I should adopt Communism with friends and Individualism with strangers, and shape my future life according to experience. Thus, a free and easy change from one variety of Communism to another, thence to any variety of Individualism, and so on, would be the most obvious and elementary thing in a really free society; and if any group of people tried to check this, to make one system predominant, they would be as bitterly fought as revolutionists fight the present system.&lt;ref&gt;Max Nettlau. [http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/max-nettlau-anarchism-communist-or-individualist-both "Anarchism: Communist or Individualist? Both"].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[French individualist anarchism|French individualist anarchist]] [[Émile Armand]] argued for a pluralistic economic logic when he said: "Here and there everything happening – here everyone receiving what they need, there each one getting whatever is needed according to their own capacity. Here, [[Gift economy|gift]] and barter – one product for another; there, exchange – product for representative value. Here, the producer is the owner of the product, there, the product is put to the possession of the collectivity".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/emile-armand-anarchist-individualism-and-amorous-comradeship#toc19 Émile Armand. ''Anarchist Individualism and Amorous Comradeship'']&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Spanish Revolution led by the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and by the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]], the issue of the coexistence of different economic systems was addressed. [[Daniel Guérin]] in ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' reports the following:
:"Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalism]] had long been concerned to safeguard the autonomy of what it called "[[affinity group]]s." There were many adepts of naturism and [[vegetarianism]] among its members, especially among the poor [[peasant]]s of the south. Both these ways of living were considered suitable for the transformation of the human being in preparation for a libertarian society. At the Saragossa congress the members did not forget to consider the fate of groups of naturists and nudists, "unsuited to industrialization." As these groups would be unable to supply all their own needs, the congress anticipated that their delegates to the meetings of the confederation of communes would be able to negotiate special economic agreements with the other agricultural and industrial communes. On the eve of a vast, bloody, social transformation, the CNT did not think it foolish to try to meet the infinitely varied aspirations of individual human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Anarchism__From_Theory_to_Practice.html|title=Anarchism: From Theory to Practice|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commune, federalism and economic democracy ===
{{main|Economic democracy|Commune|Federalism#Federalism as the anarchist and libertarian socialist mode of political organization|Libertarian municipalism|Socialization (economics)|Communisation}}
Anarcho-communism has been critical of a simple call for worker's ownership of workplaces and their administration as cooperatives. [[Murray Bookchin]] has put it this way "what of the [[Revolutionary syndicalism|syndicalist]] ideal of "collectivized" self-managed enterprises that are coordinated by like occupations on a national level and coordinated geographically by "collectives" on a local level?...Here, the traditional socialist criticism of this syndicalist form of economic management is not without its point: the corporate or private capitalist, "worker-controlled" or not – ironically, a technique in the repertoire of industrial management that is coming very much into vogue today as "workplace democracy" and "employee ownership" and constitutes no threat whatever to private property and capitalism...In any case, "economic democracy" has not simply meant "workplace democracy" and "employee ownership." Many workers, in fact, would like to get away from their factories if they could and find more creative artisanal types of work, not simply "participate" in "planning" their own misery. What "[[economic democracy]]" meant in its profoundest sense was free, "democratic" access to the means of life, the counterpart of political democracy, that is, the guarantee of freedom from material want. It is a dirty bourgeois trick, in which many radicals unknowingly participate, that "economic democracy" has been re-interpreted as "employee ownership" and "workplace democracy" and has come to mean workers' "participation" in profit sharing and industrial management rather than freedom from the tyranny of the factory, rationalized labor, and "planned production", which is usually exploitative production with the complicity of the workers".&lt;ref name=Bookchin&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/municipalization-murray-bookchin "Municipalization: Community Ownership of the Economy"] by Murray Bookchin&lt;/ref&gt;

A common call within anarchism is for a [[Federalism#Federalism as the Anarchist Mode of Political Organization|confederal]] form in relationships of [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]] and [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]] between communes as an alternative to the [[centralism]] of the [[nation-state]]. Peter Kropotkin thus suggested: "Representative government has accomplished its historical mission; it has given a mortal blow to court-rule; and by its debates it has awakened public interest in public questions. But to see in it the government of the future socialist society is to commit a gross error. Each economic phase of life implies its own political phase; and it is impossible to touch the very basis of the present economic life – private property – without a corresponding change in the very basis of the political organization. Life already shows in which direction the change will be made. Not in increasing the powers of the State, but in resorting to free organization and free federation in all those branches which are now considered as attributes of the State".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-anarchist-communism-its-basis-and-principles|title=Anarchist Communism: Its Basis and Principles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, "no community can hope to achieve economic autarchy, nor should it try to do so unless it wishes to become self-enclosed and parochial, not only "self-sufficient." Hence the confederation of communes—the Commune of communes—is reworked economically as well as politically into a shared universe of publicly managed resources. The management of the economy, precisely because it is a public activity, does not degenerate into privatized interactions between enterprises; rather it develops into confederalized interactions between municipalities. That is to say, the very elements of societal interaction are expanded from real or potential privatized components to institutionally real public components. Confederation becomes a public project by definition, not only because of shared needs and resources. If there is any way to avoid the emergence of the city-state, not to speak of self-serving bourgeois "cooperatives", it is through a municipalization of political life that is so complete that politics embraces not only what we call the public sphere but material means of life as well".&lt;ref name=Bookchin /&gt;

Economic democracy as proposed by [[Takis Fotopoulos]]&lt;ref&gt;"This leads to the proposal for a new conception of social welfare – the third aim of the paper – which is based on a conception of economic democracy, as an integral part of an inclusive democracy."[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/dn/vol5/fotopoulos_welfare.htm Welfare State or Economic Democracy?] by Takis Fotopoulos&lt;/ref&gt; and Bookchin&lt;ref&gt;"In any case, "economic democracy" has not simply meant "workplace democracy" and "employee ownership." Many workers, in fact, would like to get away from their factories if they could and find more creative artisanal types of work, not simply "participate" in "planning" their own misery. What "economic democracy" meant in its profoundest sense was free, "democratic" access to the means of life, the counterpart of political democracy, that is, the guarantee of freedom from material want."[http://www.crisismirror.info/articles/municipalization-community-ownership-of-the-economy-murray-bookchin/ "Municipalization: Community Ownership of the Economy"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130218165923/http://www.crisismirror.info/articles/municipalization-community-ownership-of-the-economy-murray-bookchin/ |date=2013-02-18 }} by Murray Bookchin&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] philosophy that proposes to shift decision-making power from [[Shareholders|corporate shareholders]] to a larger group of [[stakeholder theory|public stakeholders]] that includes workers, customers, suppliers, neighbors and the broader public. No single definition or approach encompasses economic democracy, but most proponents claim that modern property relations [[externality|externalize]] costs, subordinate the general well-being to private profit and deny the polity a democratic voice in economic policy decisions.&lt;ref name="Smith 2005"&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith| first = J. W.| authorlink = J. W. Smith| title = Economic Democracy: The Political Struggle for the 21st century| publisher = Institute for Economic Democracy Press| location = Radford, Virginia| year = 2005| isbn = 1-933567-01-5| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these moral concerns, economic democracy makes practical claims, such as that it can compensate for capitalism's claimedly inherent [[effective demand]] gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Harvey| first = David| title = The Enigma of Capital and the Crises of Capitalism| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford [England]; New York| year = 2010| isbn = 978-0-19-975871-5| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of economic democracy generally argue that modern capitalism tends to hinder or prevent society from earning enough income to purchase its output production. [[Corporation|Corporate]] monopoly of [[Common-pool resource|common resources]] typically creates [[artificial scarcity]], resulting in socio-economic imbalances that restrict workers from access to economic opportunity and diminish consumer [[purchasing power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = George| first = Henry| year = 1912| origyear = 1879| title = Progress and Poverty: An Inquiry into the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with Increase of Wealth: The Remedy| publisher = Doubleday, Page &amp; Co| location = Garden City, New York| oclc = 338381| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic democracy has been proposed as a component of larger socioeconomic ideologies, as a stand-alone theory and as a variety of reform agendas. For example, as a means to securing full [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic rights]], it opens a path to full [[Civil Rights|political rights]], defined as including the former.&lt;ref name="Smith 2005"/&gt; As a reform agenda, supporting theories and real-world examples range from [[decentralization]] to [[Cooperative|democratic cooperatives]], [[fair trade]] and the [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalization]] of [[Local food|food production]] and [[Local currency|currency]].

== Examples of anarchist economies ==
{{see also|List of anarchist communities}}
[[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]] (sometimes known as Trialville) was an [[individualist anarchist]] colony begun in 1847 by Josiah Warren and associates in the United States on a tract of land approximately 30 miles from [[Cincinnati]]. Another example of individual anarchists attempting to put their economic theories into action was the [[Cincinnati Time Store]], where [[labor notes (currency)|labor notes]] were redeemable for goods.

The anarchist collectives formed during the [[Spanish Civil War]] are the most famous example of an anarchist economy operating on a large scale. The collectives were formed under the influence of the anarcho-syndicalist [[Trade union|union]] (the CNT) in rural and urban areas and successfully practised [[workers' self-management]] and [[collectivist anarchism]] for a number of years in extremely difficult economic and political circumstances. Other examples of self-management include the factory committee movement during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the workplace occupations in Argentina during its crisis at the turn of the 21st century. Attempts at forming co-operatives also appeared during the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871 and the [[Biennio Rosso|Italian factory occupations of 1920]].

The majority of the Bedes live on snake related trading, such as [[snake charming]](training), snake catching, snake selling, etc. They also sell lucky [[heathers]], herbal medicines, which they claim have magical properties. Bedes' other occupations are in the entertainment services (e.g. monkey shows, magic shows) and petty trading.&lt;ref name=mobile-school/&gt;Many villagers believe in the magical powers of the gypsies. They can make evil spirits leave someone's body according to magical powers.

Some of them beg on the busy streets of big cities like [[Dhaka]], [[Chittagong]], [[Khulna]]. They do not have any kind of formal education and they do not use medical facilities.  Most of them speak [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. Most of them are Muslim but also practice Hinduism, Shamanism and Animism along with Islam. They are related to other South Asian nomadic groups, such as the [[Domba|Dom]].

The Bedes are a marginalized group. About 98 percent of Bedes live below the poverty line, and about 95% of Bede children do not attend school. Historically the Bedes were unable to vote as they did not own land, nor could they apply for banks loan or [[microcredit]] for the same reason.&lt;ref name=mobile-school/&gt; However, in 2008 the Bedes were able to win their right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/01/201312181138776540.html |work=Al Jazeera |publisher=Bijoyeta Das |title=Rough sailing for Bangladesh river-gypsies |deadurl=no |accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
From all over Europe, even from behind the [[Iron Curtain]], [[Romani people|Gypsies]] make an annual pilgrimage to the holy shrine of their [[patron saint]] in the [[Provence]] region of southern France. But something is different about this year's gathering, with many suspicious deaths. Cecile Dubois and Neil Bowman, a British agent, decide to investigate.

Eavesdropping, Bowman discovers that a man named Gaiuse Strome is financing the gypsies, and his suspicions on the real identity of Strome centre on a highly wealthy aristocrat, distinguished folklorist and gastronome, Le Grand Duc Charles de Croytor, whose girlfriend Lila Delafont is a friend of Cecile. As they follow the caravan, Bowman and Cecile find that their lives are in danger many times in an effort to uncover the secret the gypsies are so determined to hide, and before long are running for their lives.

[[File:Cholera belt.jpg|thumb|upright|1914 advertisement]]
A '''cholera belt''' was a flat strip of (usually red) [[flannel]] or knitted wool about six feet long and six inches wide which was twisted around the abdomen before wearing a shirt and purported to be a preventive measure against [[cholera]]. It was a standard army issue and widely believed to protect the wearer from cholera, [[dysentery]] and other ills thought to be brought about by chilling of the abdomen. Their use continued well after the causal agent of cholera was established.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite journal|title=The history of the flannel binder and cholera belt|author=Renbourn, E.T.|journal=Medical History |volume=1|issue=3| year=1957|pages=211–225|doi=10.1017/S0025727300021281|pmid=13440256|pmc=1034286}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848 the instructions to army medical officers in India included the suggestion that every soldier should be provided two "cholera belts". In the early 1900s, its use was still recommended for preventing dysentery.&lt;ref name=hist /&gt; In 1914, donations by the tiny village of [[Middlemarch, New Zealand|Middlemarch]], [[New Zealand]] of items such as tobacco, shirts and tinned fruit for soldiers going to fight in [[World War I]], included "26 cholera belts".&lt;ref&gt;Cited on p. 4, Taieri Pet, Newsletter for Middlemarch area, 1 August 1914&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of abdominal chilling as a factor in illness was brought up as late as 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acute non-specific diarrhoea and dysentery.

[[File:Population of Korea.svg|300px|thumb|right|Population of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 2015.]]
This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[South Korea]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

In June 2012, South Korea's population reached 50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asianewsnet.net/home/news.php?id=32310 |title=South Korea’s population passes 50 million |date=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2000s, South Korea has been struggling with a low birthrate, leading some researchers to suggest that if current population trends hold, the country's population will shrink to approximately 38 million population towards the end of the 21st century&lt;ref&gt;These estimates are based on UN population division of 2017 version.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, South Korea's population was 51.25 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL|title=Population, total {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In South Korea, a variety of different Asian people had migrated to the Korean Peninsula in past centuries, however few have remain permanent. South Korea and North Korea are among the world's most ethnically homogenous nations. Both North Korea and South Korea equate nationality or citizenship with membership in a single, homogenous ethnic group and politicized notion of "race."

The common language and especially race are viewed as important elements by South Koreans in terms of identity, more than citizenship.

According to Worldometers' South Korea Population Forecast statistics, South Korea is supposed to have a .36% yearly change increase by 2020, a .28% yearly change increase by 2025, a .18% yearly change increase by 52,701,817, and a .04% yearly change increase by 2035.&lt;ref name="South Korea Population (2018) - Worldometers"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/south-korea-population/|title=South Korea Population (2018) - Worldometers|website=www.worldometers.info|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to those same statistics, the years from 2040 to 2050 are supposed to have a steady decline of yearly change percentages.&lt;ref name="South Korea Population (2018) - Worldometers" /&gt;

The population of South Korea showed robust growth since the republic's establishment in 1948, and then dramatically slowed down with the effects of its economic growth. In the first official census, taken in 1949, the total population of South Korea was calculated at 20,188,641 people. The 1985 census total was 40,466,577. Population growth was slow, averaging about 1.1% annually during the period from 1949 to 1955, when the population registered at 21.5 million. Growth accelerated between 1955 and 1966 to 29.2 million or an annual average of 2.8%, but declined significantly during the period 1966 to 1985 to an annual average of 1.7%. Thereafter, the annual average growth rate was estimated to be less than 1%, similar to the low growth rates of most industrialized countries and to the target figure set by the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs for the 1990s. As of January 1, 1989, the population of South Korea was estimated to be approximately 42.2 million.

The proportion of the total population under fifteen years of age has risen and fallen with the growth rate. In 1955 approximately 41.2% of the population was under fifteen years of age, a percentage that rose to 43.5% in 1966 before falling to 38.3% in 1975, 34.2% in 1980, and 29.9% in 1985. In the past, the large proportion of children relative to the total population put great strains on the country's economy, particularly because substantial resources were invested in education facilities. With the slowdown in the population growth rate and a rise in the median age (from 18.7 years to 21.8 years between 1960 and 1980), the [[Population pyramid|age structure of the population]] has begun to resemble the columnar pattern typical of developed countries, rather than the pyramidal pattern found in most parts of the Third World.

The decline in the population growth rate and in the proportion of people under fifteen years of age after 1966 reflected the success of official and unofficial birth control programs. The government of President Syngman Rhee (1948–60) was conservative in such matters. Although Christian churches initiated a family planning campaign in 1957, it was not until 1962 that the government of Park Chung Hee, alarmed at the way in which the rapidly increasing population was undermining economic growth, began a nationwide family planning program. Other factors that contributed to a slowdown in population growth included [[urbanization]], later marriage ages for both men and women, higher education levels, a greater number of women in the labor force, and better health standards.

Public and private agencies involved in family planning included the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Planned Parenthood Federation of Korea, and the Korea Institute of Family Planning. In the late 1980s, their activities included distribution of free birth control devices and information, classes for women on family planning methods, and the granting of special subsidies and privileges (such as low-interest housing loans) to parents who agreed to undergo sterilization. There were 502,000 South Koreans sterilized in 1984, as compared with 426,000 in the previous year.&lt;ref name="Andrea Matles Savada 1992 79"&gt;{{cite book|author= Andrea Matles Savada|title=South Korea: A Country Study|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=_adMWevoEq0C|year=1992| page=79|isbn=9780788146190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1973 Maternal and Child Health Law legalized abortion. In 1983 the government began suspending medical insurance benefits for maternal care for pregnant women with three or more children. It also denied tax deductions for education expenses to parents with two or more children.

As in China, cultural attitudes posed problems for family planning programs. A strong preference for sons—who in Korea's traditional Confucian value system are expected to care for their parents in old age and carry on the family name—means that parents with only daughters usually continued to have children until a son is born. The government encouraged married couples to have only one child. This has been a prominent theme in [[public service advertising]], which stresses "have a single child and raise it well."

Total fertility rates (the average number of births a woman will have during her lifetime) fell from 6.1 births per female in 1960 to 4.2 in 1970, 2.8 in 1980, and 2.4 in 1984. The number of live births, recorded as 711,810 in 1978, grew to a high of 917,860 in 1982. This development stirred apprehensions among family planning experts of a new "baby boom." By 1986, however, the number of live births had declined to 806,041.

Decline in population growth continued, and between 2005 and 2010 total fertility rate for South Korean women was 1.21, one of the world's lowest according to the United Nations.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2006/WPP2006_Highlights_rev.pdf |author=[[United Nations]] Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division |publisher=UN |title=United Nations World Population Prospects: 2006 revision, Table A.15 |location=New York |year=2007 |accessdate=7 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fertility rate well below the replacement level of 2.1 births per female has triggered a national alarm, with dire predictions of an aging society unable to grow or support its elderly. Recent Korean governments have prioritized the issue on its agenda, promising to enact social reforms that will encourage women to have children.

The country's population increased to 46 million by the end of the twentieth century, with growth rates ranging between 0.9% and 1.2%. The population is expected to stabilize (that is, cease to grow) in the year 2023 at around 52.6 million people. In the words of Asiaweek magazine, the "stabilized tally will approximate the number of Filipinos in 1983, but squeezed into less than a third of their [the Philippines'] space."

===Population settlement patterns===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}

South Korea is one of the world's most densely populated countries, with an estimated 425 people per square kilometer in 1989—over sixteen times the average population density of the United States in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/south-korea/33.htm|website=Publication}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, China had an estimated 114 people, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) 246 people, and Japan 323 people per square kilometer in the late 1980s.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Because about 70% of South Korea's land area is mountainous and the population is concentrated in the lowland areas, actual population densities were in general greater than the average. As early as 1975, it was estimated that the density of South Korea's thirty-five cities, each of which had a population of 50,000 or more inhabitants, was 3,700 people per square kilometer. Because of continued migration to urban areas, the figure was doubtless higher in the late 1980s.

In 1988 Seoul had a population density of 17,030 people per square kilometer as compared with 13,816 people per square kilometer in 1980. The second largest city, Busan, had a density of 8,504 people per square kilometer in 1988 as compared with 7,272 people in 1980. Kyonggi Province, which surrounds the capital and contains Inch'on, the country's fourth largest city, was the most densely populated province; Kangwon Province in the northeast was the least densely populated province.

According to the government's Economic Planning Board, the population density will be 530 people per square kilometer by 2023, the year the population is expected to stabilize.

Rural areas in South Korea consist of agglomerated villages in river valleys and range from a few houses to several hundred.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Korea/Settlement-patterns|title=South Korea {{!}} Culture, History, and People - Settlement patterns|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These villages are located in the south that are backed by hills and give strong protection from winter winds.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"/&gt;

Since 1960, the pace of urbanization in South Korea has hit a considerable decline in population of rural areas and the traditional rural lifestyle has been slowly fading away.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"/&gt;

==== Aging population ====

South Korea faces the problem of a rapidly aging population. In fact, the speed of aging in Korea is unprecedented in human history,&lt;ref name="South Korean: Ageing Tiger"&gt;Thomas Klassen [http://globalbrief.ca/blog/2010/01/12/south-korea-ageing-tiger/ "South Korean: Ageing Tiger"], ''Global Brief'', January 12, 2010, accessed February 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 18 years to double aging population from 7 – 14% (least number of years),&lt;ref&gt;Neil Howe, Richard Jackson, Keisuke Nakashima. ''The Aging of Korea: Demographics and retirement policy in the land of the morning calm''. Center for Strategic and International Studies, 2007, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; overtaking even Japan. Statistics support this observation, the percentage of elderly aged 65 and above, has sharply risen from 3.3% in 1955 to 10.7% in 2009.&lt;ref name="joongangdaily.joins.com"&gt;Jung Ha-won [http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2912868 "Statistics highlight scale of the aging population"], ''Korea JoongAng Daily'', November 21, 2009, accessed February 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of its population has changed from a pyramid in the 1990s, with more young people and fewer old people, to a diamond shape in 2010, with less young people and a large proportion of middle-age individuals.&lt;ref name="South Korean: Aging Tiger"&gt;Thomas Klassen [http://globalbrief.ca/blog/2010/01/12/south-korea-ageing-tiger/ "South Korean: Aging Tiger"], ''Global Brief'', January 12, 2010, accessed February 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several implications and issues associated with an aging population. A rapidly aging population is likely to have several negative implications on the labour force. In particular, experts predict that this might lead to a shrinking of the labour force. As an increasing proportion of people enter their 50s and 60s, they either choose to retire or are forced to retire by their companies. As such, there would be a decrease in the percentage of economically active people in the population. Also, with rapid aging, it is highly likely that there would be an imbalance in the young-old percentage of the workforce. This might lead to a lack of vibrancy and innovation in the labour force, since it is helmed mainly by the middle-age workers. Data shows that while there are fewer young people in society, the percentage of economically active population, made up of people ages 15 – 64, has gone up by 20% from 55.5% to 72.5%.&lt;ref name="joongangdaily.joins.com"/&gt; This shows that the labour force is indeed largely made up of middle-aged workers.

A possible consequence might be that South Korea would be a less attractive candidate for investment. Investors might decide to relocate to countries like Vietnam and China, where there is an abundance of cheaper, younger labour. If employers were to choose to maintain operations in South Korea, there is a possibility that they might incur higher costs in retraining or upgrading the skills of this group of middle-age workers. On top of that, higher healthcare costs might also be incurred &lt;ref&gt;''Spectre of aging population worries economists''. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, Volume 88, Number 3, March 2010, p. 161-240.&lt;/ref&gt; and the government would need to set aside more money to maintain a good healthcare system to cater to the elderly.

Due to the very low birth rate, South Korea is predicted to enter a [[Russian Cross]] pattern once the large generation born in the 1960s starts to die off, with potentially decades of population decline.

===Urbanization===
Like other newly industrializing economies, South Korea experienced rapid growth of urban areas caused by the migration of large numbers of people from the countryside. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Seoul, by far the largest urban settlement, had a population of about 190,000 people. There was a striking contrast with Japan, where Edo (Tokyo) had as many as 1 million inhabitants and the urban population comprised as much as 10% to 15% of the total during the Tokugawa Period (1600–1868). During the closing years of the Choson Dynasty and the first years of Japanese colonial rule, the urban population of Korea was no more than 3% of the total. After 1930, when the Japanese began industrial development on the Korean Peninsula, particularly in the northern provinces adjacent to Manchuria, the urban portion of the population began to grow, reaching 11.6% for all of Korea in 1940.

Between 1945 and 1985, the urban population of South Korea grew from 14.5% to 65.4% of the total population. In 1988 the Economic Planning Board estimated that the urban portion of the population will reach 78.3% by the end of the twentieth century. Most of this urban increase was attributable to migration rather than to natural growth of the urban population. Urban birth rates have generally been lower than the national average. The extent of urbanization in South Korea, however, is not fully revealed in these statistics. Urban population was defined in the national census as being restricted to those municipalities with 50,000 or more inhabitants. Although many settlements with fewer than 50,000 inhabitants were satellite towns of Seoul or other large cities or mining communities in northeastern Kangwon Province, which would be considered urban in terms of the living conditions and occupations of the inhabitants, they still were officially classified as rural.

The dislocation caused by the Korean War accounted for the rapid increase in urban population during the early 1950s. Hundreds of thousands of refugees, many of them from North Korea, streamed into the cities. During the post-Korean War period, rural people left their ancestral villages in search of greater economic and educational opportunities in the cities. By the late 1960s, migration had become a serious problem, not only because cities were terribly overcrowded, but also because the rural areas were losing the most youthful and productive members of their labor force.

In 1970, the Park Chung Hee government launched the [[Saemaul Undong]] (New Community Movement) as a rural reconstruction and self-help movement to improve economic conditions in the villages, close the wide gap in income between rural and urban areas, and stem urban migration—as well as to build a political base. Despite a huge amount of government sponsored publicity, especially during the Park era, it was not clear by the late 1980s that the Saemaul undong had achieved its objectives. By that time many, if not most, farming and fishing villages consisted of older persons; relatively few able-bodied men and women remained to work in the fields or to fish. This trend was apparent in government statistics for the 1986–87 period: the proportion of people fifty years old or older living in farming communities grew from 28.7% in 1986 to 30.6% in 1987, while the number of people in their twenties living in farming communities declined from 11.3% to 10.8%. The nationwide percentages for people fifty years old or older and in their twenties were, in 1986, 14.9% and 20.2%, respectively (see Agriculture, ch. 3).

In 1985 the largest cities were Seoul (9,645,932 inhabitants), Busan (3,516,807), Daegu (2,030,672), Incheon (1,387,491), Gwangju (906,129), and Daejeon (866,695). According to government statistics, the population of Seoul, one of the world's largest cities, surpassed 10 million people in late 1988. Seoul's average annual population growth rate during the late 1980s was more than 3%. Two-thirds of this growth was attributable to migration rather than to natural increase. Surveys revealed that "new employment or seeking a new job," "job transfer," and "business" were major reasons given by new immigrants for coming to the capital. Other factors cited by immigrants included "education" and "a more convenient area to live."

To alleviate overcrowding in Seoul's downtown area, the city government drew up a master plan in the mid-1980s that envisioned the development of four "core zones" by 2000: the original downtown area, Yongdongpo-Yeouido, Yongdong, and Jamsil. Satellite towns also would be established or expanded. In the late 1980s, statistics revealed that the daytime or commuter population of downtown Seoul was as much as six times the officially registered population. If the master plan is successful, many commuters will travel to work in a core area nearer their homes, and the downtown area's daytime population will decrease. Many government ministries have been moved out of Seoul, and the army, navy, and air force headquarters have been relocated to [[Daejeon]].

In 1985 the population of Seoul constituted 23.8% of the national total. Provincial cities, however, experienced equal and, in many cases, greater expansion than the capital. Growth was particularly spectacular in the southeastern coastal region, which encompasses the port cities of Busan, Masan, Yosu, Chinhae, Ulsan, and Pohang. Census figures show that Ulsan's population increased eighteenfold, growing from 30,000 to 551,300 inhabitants between 1960 and 1985. With the exception of Yosu, all of these cities are in South Kyongsang Province, a region that has been an especially favored recipient of government development projects. By comparison, the population of Kwangju, capital of South Cholla Province, increased less than threefold between 1960 and 1985, growing from 315,000 to 906,129 inhabitants.

Rapid urban growth has brought familiar problems to developed and developing countries alike. The construction of large numbers of high-rise apartment complexes in Seoul and other large cities alleviated housing shortages to some extent. But it also imposed hardship on the tens of thousands of people who were obliged to relocate from their old neighborhoods because they could not afford the rents in the new buildings. In the late 1980s, squatter areas consisting of one-story shacks still existed in some parts of Seoul. Housing for all but the wealthiest was generally cramped. The concentration of factories in urban areas, the rapid growth of motorized traffic, and the widespread use of coal for heating during the severe winter months caused dangerous levels of air and water pollution, issues that still persist today even after years of environmentally friendly policies.

Like other newly industrializing economies, South Korea experienced rapid growth of urban areas caused by the migration of large numbers of people from the countryside. In 2016, 82.59 percent of South Korea's total population lived in urban areas and cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/455905/urbanization-in-south-korea/|title=South Korea - urbanization 2006-2016 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic groups==
{{Further|Foreigners in South Korea}}
South Korea is a relatively homogeneous society with an absolute majority of the population of [[Koreans|Korean]] ethnicity who account for approximately 96% of the total population of the Korean Republic. However, with its emergence as an economic powerhouse, opportunities for foreign immigrants increased and in 2007 the number of foreign citizens resident in South Korea passed the million mark for the first time in history,&lt;ref name="Yonhap News"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/231164.html |author=Yonhap News |publisher=Hankyoreh |title=South Korea's foreign population passes the million mark for the first time in history}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the number reached 2 million in 2016. 1,016,000 of them came from China, with more than half of them being ethnic Koreans of Chinese citizenship. The next largest group was from Vietnam with 149,000 residents. The third largest group was from the United States with 117,000 residents, excluding the American troops stationed in the country. Thailand, Philippines, Uzbekistan and other countries followed.

=== Chinese in South Korea ===

When the People's Republic of China and South Korea reformed relationship was settled in, several Chinese migrants had emerged in South Korea in 1992.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; In the early 1900s, a trade agreement allowed merchants from China conduct business trades in South Korea.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/ethnic-minorities-and-immigrants-in-south-korea.html|title=Ethnic Minorities And Immigrants In South Korea|work=WorldAtlas|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Americans in South Korea ===
South Korea's immigration rules are especially strict for non-Asians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The South Koreans place various regulations on individuals applying for citizenship via marriage with one required to pass a Korean language proficiency test and have an annual income more than 14 million wons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to this fact, most North Americans come to the country either as tourists or professionals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Vietnamese in South Korea ===

The relationship between Vietnamese and South Koreans goes back to the year 1200 when Ly Duong had left to Goreyeo in Korea after a succession of power dispute.  Nowadays, Vietnamese migrants that go to South Korea are introduced to local husbands via marriage agencies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Filipinos in South Korea ===

The relationship between Filipinos and South Koreans can be traced back to the 1950s during the Korean war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Over 7,500 Filipino soldiers fought on the United Nations' side to assist South Korea's conflict with North Korea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During 2007, there was estimated to be around 70,000 Filipino immigrants in South Korea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The mass rural urban migration led to a shortage of young women in those areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This led many Filipino brides find their way to South Korea and migrate over there.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Languages==
{{Main|Korean language|Koreanic languages}}
The [[Korean language]] is the native language spoken by the vast majority of the population. English is widely taught in both public and private schools as a foreign language. However, general fluency in English in the country is relatively low compared to other industrialized developed countries. There is a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] minority who speak [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Cantonese dialect|Cantonese]]. Some elderly may still speak [[Japanese language|Japanese]], which was official during the [[Japanese Korea|Japanese rule in Korea]] (1905–1945).&lt;ref name="Languages in South Korea"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gapyear.com/articles/travel-tips/south-korea-languages|title=Languages in South Korea|date=2015-04-08|work=Gap Year|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Languages in South Korea"/&gt;

In different areas of South Korea, different dialects are spoken. For example, the Gyeongsang dialect spoken around Busan and Daegu to the south sounds quite rough and aggressive compared to standard Korean.&lt;ref name="Languages in South Korea"/&gt;

==Koreans living overseas==
Large-scale [[emigration]] from Korea began around 1904 and continued until the end of [[World War II]]. During the [[Korea under Japanese rule]] period, many Koreans emigrated to [[Manchuria]] (present-day [[China]]'s northeastern provinces of [[Liaoning]], [[Jilin]], and [[Heilongjiang]]), other parts of China, the [[Soviet Union]], [[Hawaii]], and the contiguous [[United States]].

Most emigrated for economic reasons; employment opportunities were scarce, and many Korean farmers lost their land after the Japanese introduced a system of land registration and private land tenure, imposed higher land taxes, and promoted the growth of an absentee landlord class charging exorbitant rents. Koreans from the northern provinces of Korea went mainly to Manchuria, China, and [[Siberia]]. Many people from the southern provinces went to Japan. Koreans were conscripted into Japanese labor battalions or the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]], especially during World War II. In the 1940–44 period, nearly 2 million Koreans lived in Japan, 1.4 million in Manchuria, 600,000 in Siberia, and 130,000 in China. An estimated 40,000 Koreans were scattered among other countries. At the end of World War II, approximately 2 million Koreans were repatriated from Japan and Manchuria.

More than 4 million ethnic Koreans lived outside the peninsula during the early 1980s. The largest group, about 1.7 million people, lived in China, the descendants of the Korean farmers who had left the country during the Japanese occupation. Most had assumed Chinese citizenship. The Soviet Union had about 430,000 ethnic Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;''South Korea: A Country Study''. DIANE Publishing Company, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, many of Japan's approximately 700,000 Koreans had below-average [[standards of living]]. This situation occurred partly because of discrimination by the Japanese majority and partly because a large number of resident Koreans, loyal to the North Korean regime of [[Kim Il Sung]], preferred to remain separate from and hostile to the Japanese mainstream. The pro–North Korea [[Chongryon]] (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan) initially was more successful than the pro–South Korea [[Mindan]] (Association for Korean Residents in Japan) in attracting adherents among residents in Japan. Since diplomatic relations were established between [[Seoul]] and [[Tokyo]] in 1965, however, the South Korean government has taken an active role in promoting the interests of their residents in Japan in negotiations with the Japanese government. It also has provided subsidies to Korean schools in Japan and other community activities.

By the end of 1988 there were over two million South Koreans residing overseas. [[North America]] was the destination of over 1.2 million. South Koreans also were residents of [[Immigration to Australia|Australia]] (100,000), [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] (45,000), the [[Middle East]] (12,000), [[Western Europe]] (40,000), [[New Zealand]] (30,000), other Asian countries (27,000), and [[Africa]] (25,000). A limited number of South Korean government-sponsored migrants settled in [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], and other [[Latin American]] countries.

Because of South Korea's rapid economic expansion, an increasing number of its citizens reside abroad on a temporary basis as business executives, technical personnel, foreign students, and construction workers. A large number of formerly expatriate South Koreans have returned to South Korea primarily because of the country's much improved economic conditions and the difficulties they experienced in adjusting to living abroad.

The '''E. Mead Johnson Award''', given by the [[Society for Pediatric Research]], was established in 1939 to honor clinical and laboratory research achievements in [[pediatrics]]. The awards are funded by [[Mead Johnson|Mead Johnson Nutritionals]], a subsidiary of [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] and are named after [[Edward Mead Johnson]], a co-founder of the originating company [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aps-spr.org/spr/awards/EMJ/default.asp |title= E. Mead Johnson Award in pediatric Research| publisher=American Pediatric Society and Society for Pediatric Research | accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In most years, two prizes are awarded. Two researchers sometimes share a prize.

Surveys of victims of crime have been undertaken in many cities and countries, using a common [[methodology]] to aid comparability, and have generally included questions on sexual violence. The [[United Nations]] has conducted extensive surveys to determine the level of sexual violence in different societies. According to these studies, the percentage of women reporting having been a victim of sexual assault ranges from less than 2% in places such as [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]] (1.4%), [[Gaborone]], [[Botswana]] (0.8%), [[Beijing]], [[China]] (1.6%), and [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] (0.3%), to 5% or more in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] (6.0%), [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] (5.8%), [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] (8.0%), and [[Bogota]], [[Colombia]] (5.0%).&lt;ref&gt;The international crime victim survey in countries in transition: national reports. Rome, United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victims of crime in the developing world. Rome, United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

No distinction has been made in these figures between rape by strangers and that by intimate partners. Surveys that fail to make this distinction or those that only examine rape by strangers usually underestimate substantially the prevalence of sexual violence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jewkes R, Abrahams N. The epidemiology of rape and sexual coercion in South Africa: an overview. Social Science and Medicine (in press).&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from crime surveys, there have been a small number of surveys, with representative samples, that have asked women about sexual violence. For instance, in a national survey conducted in the [[United States of America]], 14.8% of women over 17 years of age reported having been raped in their lifetime (with an additional 2.8% having experienced [[attempted rape]]) and 0.3% of the sample reported having been raped in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Tjaden P, Thoennes N. Full report of the prevalence, incidence and consequences of [[violence against women]]: findings from the National Violence Against Women Survey. Washington, DC, National Institute
of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, United States Department of Justice and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2000 (NCJ 183781).&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of a representative sample of women aged 18– 49 years in three provinces of South Africa found that in the previous year 1.3% of women had been forced, physically or by means of verbal threats, to have non-consensual sex.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In a survey of a representative sample of the general population over 15 years of age in the [[Czech Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weiss P, Zverina J | year = 1999 | title = Experiences with sexual aggression within the general population in the Czech Republic | doi = 10.1023/A:1018740527252 | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 265–269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 11.6% of women reported forced sexual contact in their lifetime, 3.4% reporting that this had occurred more than once. The most common form of contact was forced vaginal intercourse.

===Forced sexual initiation===
A growing number of studies, particularly from [[sub-Saharan Africa]], indicate that the first sexual experience of girls is sometimes unwanted and forced. In a case control study, for example, of 191 [[adolescent]] girls (mean age 16.3 years) attending an [[antenatal]] clinic in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], and 353 non [[pregnant]] adolescents matched for age and neighborhood
or school, 31.9% of the study cases and 18.1% of the controls reported that force was used during their sexual initiation. When asked about the consequences of refusing sex, 77.9% of the study cases and 72.1% of the controls said that they feared being beaten if they refused to have sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jewkes R | year = 2001 | title = Relationship dynamics and adolescent pregnancy in South Africa | url = | journal = Social Science and Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 733–744 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(00)00177-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced sexual initiation and coercion during adolescence have been reported in many studies of young women and men. Where studies have included both men and women in the sample, the prevalence of reported rape or sexual coercion has been higher among the women than the men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Matasha E | year = 1998 | title = Sexual and reproductive health among primary and secondary school pupils in Mwanza, Tanzania: need for intervention | url = | journal = AIDS Care | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 571–582 | doi=10.1080/09540129848433|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buga GA, Amoko DH, Ncayiyana DJ | year = 1996 | title = Sexual behaviour, contraceptive practice and reproductive health among school adolescents in rural Transkei | url = | journal = South African Medical Journal | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 523–527 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rwenge M. "Sexual risk behaviours among young people in Bamenda, Cameroon. ''International Family Planning Perspectives'', 2000; 118–123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halco´n L, Beuhring T, Blum R. A portrait of adolescent health in the Caribbean, 2000. Minneapolis, MN, University of Minnesota and Pan American Health Organization, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, nearly half of the sexually active adolescent women in a multi-country study in the [[Caribbean]] reported that their first sexual intercourse was forced, compared with one-third of the adolescent men.&lt;ref&gt;Halco´n L, Beuhring T, Blum R. A portrait of adolescent health in the Caribbean, 2000. Minneapolis,
MN, University of Minnesota and Pan American Health Organization, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lima]], [[Peru]], the percentage of young women reporting forced sexual initiation was almost four times that reported by the young men (40% against 11%, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Caceres CF, Vanoss M, Sid Hudes E | year = 2000 | title = Sexual coercion among youth and young adolescents in Lima, Peru | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 361–367 | doi=10.1016/s1054-139x(00)00096-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are not many studies of forced sexual initiation in the United States, and estimates from the studies that do exist vary widely. One study of 5,663 heterosexual women in the United States found that 12.5% had experienced forced sexual initiation. Of the women who were 15 years old or younger when they had their first sexual experience, 22% reported that those initiations were forced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Campbell|first = Jacquelyn C.|last2 = Lucea|first2 = Marguerite B.|last3 = Stockman|first3 = Jamila K.|last4 = Draughon|first4 = Jessica E.|date = 2013-02-01|title = Forced Sex and HIV Risk in Violent Relationships|journal = American Journal of Reproductive Immunology|language = en|volume = 69|pages = 41–44|doi = 10.1111/aji.12026|pmc = 3573255|pmid = 23066950}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1992 US National Health and Social Life Survey of over 3,400 adults, more than 4% of women reported coerced sexual initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://popcenter.uchicago.edu/data/nhsls.shtml|title=National Health and Social Life Survey {{!}} The University of Chicago|website=popcenter.uchicago.edu|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of over 24,000 women, the World Health Organization found the following rates of women reporting forced sexual initiation: 30% in a Bangladesh province, 24% in a Bangladesh city, 24% in a Peru province, 17% in an Ethiopia province, 17% in a United Republic of Tanzania province, 14% in a United Republic of Tanzania city, 8% in Samoa, 7% in a Peru city, 6% in a Namibia city, 5% in a Brazil province, 4% in a Thailand city, 3% in a Brazil city, 0.7% in a Serbia and Montenegro city, and 0.4% in a Japan city. In all of these sites except Ethiopia, the younger the woman was at the time of her first sexual experience, the more likely it was that that experience was forced sexual initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/67422|title=WHO IRIS: WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women|website=apps.who.int|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gang rape===
{{main article|Gang rape}}
Gang rape, or mass rape, occurs when a group of people participate in the rape of a single victim. Rape involving at least two or more perpetrators is widely reported to occur in many parts of the world.

===Sexual trafficking===
{{Main article|Human trafficking}}

Each year hundreds of thousands of women and girls throughout the world are bought and sold into [[prostitution]] or [[sexual slavery]].&lt;ref name="Migration Information Programme 1995"&gt;Migration Information Programme. Trafficking and prostitution: the growing exploitation of migrant women from central and eastern Europe. Geneva, International Organization for Migration, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chauzy JP. Kyrgyz Republic: trafficking. Geneva, International Organization for Migration, 20 January 2001 (Press briefing notes).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dinan K 2000"&gt;Dinan K. Owed justice: Thai women trafficked into debt bondage in Japan. New York, NY, Human Rights Watch, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard AO. International trafficking in women to the United States: a contemporary manifestation of slavery and organized crime. Washington, DC,
Center for the Study of Intelligence, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown L. Sex slaves: the trafficking of women in Asia. London, Virago Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, the most common destinations for victims of human trafficking are Thailand, Japan, Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Turkey and the United States, according to a report by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC).&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6497799.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in Kyrgyzstan has estimated that around 4,000 people were trafficked from the country in 1999, with the principal destinations being China, Germany, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Of those trafficked, 62% reported being forced to work without pay, while over 50% reported being physically abused or tortured by their employers.&lt;ref&gt;Chauzy JP. Kyrgyzstan Republic: trafficking. Geneva, International Organization for Migration, 20 January 2001 (Press briefing notes).&lt;/ref&gt;

A World Organization against Torture (OMCT) report suggested that more than 200,000 Bangladeshi women had been trafficked between 1990 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Benninger-Budel C et al. Violence against women: a
report. Geneva, World Organization Against Torture, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 200,000 Nepali girls have been trafficked to red light areas of India,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-02/15/content_10821971.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and trafficking of Thai women to Japan has also been reported.&lt;ref name="Dinan K 2000"/&gt; Trafficking of women also takes place internally within some countries, often from rural areas to cities.

In recent years, the problem of human trafficking has gotten very serious in Europe, where women from Eastern Europe, as well as from Asia, Africa and Latin America are trafficked to Western Europe. In Netherlands, it is estimated that there are from 1,000 to 7,000 trafficking victims a year. Most police investigations relate to legal sex businesses, with all sectors of prostitution being well represented, but with window brothels being particularly overrepresented.

All victims from Hungary were female and were forced into prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/local_news/Increase-in-human-trafficking-in-Netherlands_49349.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of all [[Amsterdam]]'s 8,000 to 11,000 prostitutes, more than 75% are from Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia, according to a former prostitute who produced a report about the sex trade in Amsterdam, in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5400641.ece Timesonline.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''Le Monde'' in 1997 found that 80% of prostitutes in the Netherlands were foreigners and 70% had no immigration papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/netherl.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002222727/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/netherl.htm |archivedate=2 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gvnet.com/humantrafficking/Netherlands.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the trafficking of women from Eastern Europe is often organized by people from that same region. The [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|German Federal Police Office]] (BKA) reported in 2006 a total of 357 completed investigations of human trafficking, with 775 victims. Thirty-five percent of the suspects were Germans born in Germany and 8% were German citizens born outside of Germany.&lt;ref name=bka&gt;[https://archive.is/20121217203414/http://www.bka.de/lageberichte/mh.html Reports on human trafficking], by the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]]. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North America is also an important destination for international trafficking. A study undertaken under the auspices of the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] estimated that 45,000 to 50,000 women and children are trafficked annually to the United States.&lt;ref name="Richard AO 1999"&gt;Richard AO. International trafficking in women to the United States: a contemporary manifestation of slavery and organized crime. Washington, DC, Center for the Study of Intelligence, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 150 cases of trafficking were prosecuted between 1996 and 1999 by the [[United States Department of Justice]].&lt;ref name="Richard AO 1999"/&gt; In 2004, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) estimated that 600-800 persons are trafficked into Canada annually and that additional 1,500-2,200 persons are trafficked through Canada into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gvnet.com/humantrafficking/Canada.htm Human Trafficking &amp; Modern-day Slavery - Canada&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
In Canada, foreign trafficking for prostitution is estimated to be worth $400 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unpac.ca/economy/g_migration.html Women &amp; The Economy - Globalization &amp; Migration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514045035/http://www.unpac.ca/economy/g_migration.html |date=14 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual violence against sex workers===
Whether trafficked or not, [[sex workers]] are at high risk for both physical and sexual violence, particularly where sex work is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barnard M | year = 1993 | title = Violence and vulnerability: conditions of work for streetworking prostitutes | url = | journal = Sociology of Health and Illness | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 683–705 | doi=10.1111/1467-9566.ep11434434}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of female sex workers in [[Leeds]], England, and [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, revealed that 30% had been slapped, punched or kicked by a client while working, 13% had been beaten, 11% had been raped and 22% had experienced an attempted rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Church S | year = 2001 | title = Violence by clients towards female prostitutes in different work settings: questionnaire survey | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 322 | issue = | pages = 524–525 | doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7285.524|display-authors=etal | pmid=11230067 | pmc=26557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 34% of those who had suffered violence at the hands of a client reported it to police.

A survey of sex workers in Bangladesh revealed that 49% of the women had been raped and 59% beaten by police in the previous year; the men reported much lower levels of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins C. Street sex workers in Dhaka: their clients and enemies. In:The Proceedings of the International Conference on Violence Against Women and Children, Dhaka, Bangladesh, June 1998. Dhaka, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ethiopia]], a study of sex workers also found high rates of physical and sexual violence from clients, especially against the child sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ayalew T, Berhane Y | year = 2000 | title = Child prostitution: magnitude and related problems | url = | journal = Ethiopian Medical Journal | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 153–163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual violence in schools, health care settings, armed conflicts and refugee settings==

===Schools===
For many young women, the most common place where sexual coercion and harassment are experienced is in school. In an extreme case of violence in 1991, 71 teenage girls were raped by their classmates and 19 others were killed at a boarding school in [[Meru, Kenya|Meru]], [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;Perlez J. For the oppressed sex: brave words to live by. New York Times, 6 June 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; While much of the research in this field comes from Africa, it is not clear whether this reflects a particularly high prevalence of the problem or simply the fact that the problem has had a greater visibility there than in other parts of the world.

Harassment of girls by boys is in all likelihood a global problem.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} In Canada, for example, 23% of girls had experienced sexual harassment while attending school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bagley C, Bolitho F, Bertrand L | year = 1997 | title = Sexual assault in school, mental health and suicidal behaviors in adolescent women in Canada | url = | journal = Adolescence | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 361–366 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research done in Africa, however, has highlighted the role of teachers there in facilitating or perpetrating sexual coercion. A report by Africa Rights &lt;ref&gt;Omaar R, de Waal A. Crimes without punishment: sexual harassment and violence against female students in schools and universities in Africa. African Rights, July 1994 (Discussion Paper No. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; found cases of schoolteachers attempting to gain sex, in return for good grades or for not failing pupils, in the Democratic [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]], [[Somalia]], [[South Africa]], [[Sudan]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. A recent national survey in [[South Africa]] that included questions about experience of rape before the age of 15 years found that schoolteachers were responsible for 32% of disclosed child rapes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In [[Zimbabwe]], a retrospective study of reported cases of child sexual abuse over an 8-year period (1990 to 1997) found high rates of sexual abuse committed by teachers in rural primary schools. Many of the victims were girls between 11 and 13 years of age and penetrative sex was the most prevalent type of sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bagley C, Bolitho F, Bertrand L | year = 1997 | title = Sexual assault in school, mental health and suicidal behaviors inadolescent women in Canada | url = | journal = Adolescence | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 361–366 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care settings===
Sexual violence against patients in health facilities has been reported in many places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fary T, Fisher N | year = 1992 | title = Sexual contact between doctors and patients: almost always harmful | url = | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 304 | issue = | pages = 1519–1520 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lamont JA, Woodward C | year = 1994 | title = Patient–physician sexual involvement: a Canadian survey of obstetriciangynecologists | url = | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 150 | issue = | pages = 1433–1439 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomasson GO | year = 1999 | title = Educating physicians to prevent sexrelated contact with patients | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 281 | issue = | pages = 419–420 | doi=10.1001/jama.281.5.419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dehlendorf CE, Wolfe SM 1998 1883–1888"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dehlendorf CE, Wolfe SM | year = 1998 | title = Physicians disciplined for sex-related offenses | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 279 | issue = | pages = 1883–1888 | doi=10.1001/jama.279.23.1883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McPhedran M | year = 1996 | title = Sexual abuse in the health professions: who's counting? | url = | journal = World Health Statistics Quarterly | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 154–157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silencio y complicidad: violencia contra las mujeres

[Silence and complicity: violence against women in public services in Peru.] Lima, Committee of Latin America and the Caribbean for the Defense of the Rights of the Woman, and Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; A study of physicians disciplined for sexual offences in the [[United States]], for instance, found that the number of cases had increased from 42 in 1989 to 147 in 1996, with the proportion of all disciplinary action that was sex-related rising from 2.1% to 4.4% over the same period.&lt;ref name="Dehlendorf CE, Wolfe SM 1998 1883–1888"/&gt; This increase, though, could reflect a greater readiness to lodge complaints.

Other documented forms of sexual violence against female patients include the involvement of medical staff in the practice of [[clitoridectomy]] in Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;Fayad M. Female genital mutilation (female circumcision). Cairo, Star Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; forced [[gynecological]] examinations and the threat of forced abortions in China,&lt;ref&gt;Human rights are women’s rights. London, Amnesty

===Armed conflicts and refugee settings===
{{main article|War rape}}
Rape has been used as a strategy in many conflicts, including in [[Korea]] during the [[Second World War]] and in [[Bangladesh]] during the war of independence, as well as in a range of armed conflicts such as those in [[Algeria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chelala C | year = 1998 | title = Algerian abortion controversy highlights rape of war victims | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 351 | issue = | page = 1413 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(05)79457-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kashmir|India (Kashmir)]],&lt;ref&gt;Asia Watch.

In [[East Timor]], there were reports of extensive sexual violence against women by the Indonesian military.&lt;ref name="Pacific Women Against Violence 2000"&gt;Pacific Women Against Violence. Violence against East Timor women. Pacific Women’s Network Against Violence Against Women, 2000; 5:1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; A study in [[Monrovia]], [[Liberia]], found that women under 25 years were more likely than those aged 25 years and over to report experiencing attempted rape and sexual coercion during the conflict (18% compared with 4%).&lt;ref name="Swiss S et al. 1998 625–629"/&gt; Women who were forced to cook for a warring faction were at significantly higher risk.

Another inevitable consequence of armed conflicts is the ensuing economic and social disruption which can force large numbers of people into prostitution,&lt;ref name="Pacific Women Against Violence 2000"/&gt; an observation that applies equally to the situation of refugees, whether they are fleeing armed conflicts or natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes or powerful storms.

Refugees fleeing conflicts and other threatening conditions are often at risk of rape in their new setting. Data from the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], for instance, indicated that among the boat people who fled [[Vietnam]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 39% of the women were abducted or raped by pirates while at sea, a figure that is likely to be an underestimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mollica RF, Son L | year = 1989 | title = Cultural dimensions in the evaluation and treatment of sexual trauma: an overview | url = | journal = Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 363–379 | pmid = 2748443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many refugee camps as well, including those in Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania, rape has been found to be a major problem.&lt;ref&gt;Morrell R, ed. Changing men in Southern Africa. Pietermaritzburg, University of Natal Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nduna S, Goodyear L. Pain too deep for tears: assessing the prevalence of sexual and gender violence among Burundian refugees in Tanzania. Kibondo, International Rescue Committee, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Customary forms of sexual violence==

===Child marriage===
{{main article| Child marriage}}
Marriage is often used to legitimize a range of forms of sexual violence against women. The custom of marrying off young children, particularly girls, is found in many parts of the world. This practice is legal in many countries and is a form of sexual violence, since the children involved are unable to give or withhold their consent. The majority of them know little or nothing about sex
before they are married. They therefore frequently fear it&lt;ref&gt;George A. Sexual behavior and sexual negotiation among poor women and men in Mumbai: an exploratory study. Baroda, Sahaj Society for Health Alternatives, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and their first sexual encounters are
often forced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharma V, Sujay R, Sharma A | year = 1998 | title = Can married women say no to sex? Repercussions of the denial of the sexual act | url = | journal = Journal of Family Welfare | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 1–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early marriage is most common in Africa and South Asia, though it also occurs in the Middle East and parts of Latin America and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="London 2000"&gt;Early marriage: whose right to choose? London, Forum on Marriage and the Rights of Women and Girls, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"&gt;UNICEF Innocenti Research Center. Early marriage: child spouses. Innocenti Digest, 2001, No. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ethiopia]] and parts of West Africa, for instance, marriage at the age of 7 or 8 years is not uncommon. In [[Nigeria]], the mean age at first
marriage is 17 years, but in the [[Kebbi State]] of northern [[Nigeria]], the average age at first marriage is just over 11 years.&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/&gt; High rates of child
marriage have also been reported in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]] and [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name="London 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;100. UNICEF Innocenti Research Center. Early marriage: child spouses. Innocenti Digest, 2001, No. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Asia, child marriage is especially common in rural areas, but exists also in urban areas.&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed EM. Violence against women: the legal system and institutional responses. Lahore, AGHS Legal Aid Cell, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kumari R, Singh R, Dubey A. Growing up in rural India: problems and needs of adolescent girls. New Delhi, Radiant Publishers, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Nepal]], the average age at first marriage is 19 years. Seven per cent of girls, though, are married before the age of 10 years, and 40% by the age of 15 years.&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/&gt; In [[India]], the median age at first marriage for women is 16.4 years. A survey of 5000 women in the [[India]]n state of [[Rajasthan]] found that 56% of the women had
married before the age of 15 years, and of these, 17% were married before they were 10 years old. Another survey, conducted in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]], found that 14% of girls were married between the ages of 10 and 14 years.&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/&gt;

Elsewhere, in Latin America for instance, early age at first marriage has been reported in [[Cuba]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Mexico]] and [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref name="London 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/&gt; In North America and Western Europe, less than 5% of marriages involve girls younger than 19 years of age (for example, 1% in [[Canada]],
[[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]], 2% in [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]], 3% in [[Spain]], and 4% in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Indicators on marriage and marital status. In: 1997 Demographic yearbook, 49th ed. New York, NY,
United Nations Statistics Division, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other customs leading to violence===
In many places, there are customs other than child marriage that result in sexual violence towards women. In [[Zimbabwe]], for instance, there is the custom of ''ngozi'', whereby a girl can be given to a family as [[Blood money (restitution)|compensation for a death]] of a man caused by a member of the girl's family. On reaching puberty the girl is expected to have sexual intercourse with the brother or father of the deceased person, so as to produce a son to replace the one who died. Another custom is ''[[chimutsa mapfiwa]]'', according to which, when a married woman dies, her sister is obliged to replace her in the matrimonial home. [[Widow inheritance]] is or was practised by many cultures; when a man died, his widow was forced to marry one of his brothers.

The '''Gnawa''' (or '''Gnaoua''', '''Ghanawa''', '''Ghanawi''', '''Gnawi''')  are an ethnic group inhabiting [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] in the [[Maghreb]].

The name Gnawa had probably originated in the indigenous language of North Africa and the Sahara Desert - the [[Berber language]] or [[Tamazight]]. The phonology of this term according to the grammatical principles of Berber is as follows: ''agnaw'' (singular), ''ignawen'' (plural).

==History==
The Gnawa population is generally believed to originate from the [[Sahel]]ian region of West and Central Africa which had long and extensive trading and political ties with [[Morocco]].
The Gnawa are an ethnic group who, with the passing of time became a part of the [[Sufi]] order in [[Maghreb]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
While adopting Islam, Gnawa continued to celebrate ritual possession during rituals where they are devoted to the practice of the dances of [[Spiritual possession|possession]] and fright. This rite of possession is called ''Jedba'' ({{lang-ar|جدبة|links=no}}).

==Gnawa and music==
{{Main|Gnawa music}}
Gnawa music mixes classical Islamic [[Sufism]] with pre-Islamic African traditions, whether local or sub-Saharan.
The term [[Gnawa music]]ians generally refers to people who also practice [[healer (alternative medicine)|healing]] rituals, with apparent ties to pre-Islamic African [[animism]] rites. In Moroccan popular culture, Gnawas, through their ceremonies, are considered to be experts in the magical treatment of [[scorpion]] stings and [[psychic]] disorders. They heal diseases by the use of colors, condensed cultural imagery, perfumes and fright.

Gnawas play deeply [[Hypnotism|hypnotic]] [[wiktionary:trance|trance]] music, marked by low-toned, rhythmic [[sintir]] melodies, [[call-and-response]] singing, hand clapping and [[cymbal]]s called [[krakebs|''krakeb'']] (plural of ''karkaba''). Gnawa ceremonies use music and dance to evoke ancestral saints who can drive out evil, cure psychological ills, or remedy scorpion stings.

Gnawa music has won an international profile and appeal.  Many [[Western culture|Western]] musicians including [[Bill Laswell]], [[Brian Jones]], [[Randy Weston]], [[Adam Rudolph]], [[Tucker Martine]], [[Robert Plant]] and [[Jimmy Page]], have drawn on and collaborated with Gnawa musicians such as [[Mahmoud Guinia]].  Some traditionalists regard modern collaborations as a mixed blessing, leaving or modifying sacred traditions for more explicitly commercial goals. International recording artists such as [[Hassan Hakmoun]] have introduced Gnawa music and dance to Western audiences through their recordings and concert performances.

The centre for Gnawa music is [[Essaouira]] in the south of Morocco where the [[Gnaoua World Music Festival]] is held annually. The Gnawa of [[Marrakesh]] hold their annual festival at the sanctuary of [[Moulay Brahim]] in the [[Atlas Mountains]].
The Gnawa of [[Khamlia]] hold their annual festival in August at the village Khamlia in Erg Chebbi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1292">The '''Haddad''' (also known as the Danoa) are a [[Sahel]]ian [[Muslim]] ethnic group found through [[Nigeria]], [[Chad]] and [[Sudan]], numbering more than 250,000 individuals{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}. They live in the midst of other peoples and do not have their own language but speak the language of the surrounding community. The traditional employment of the community has always been [[blacksmith]]ry.

They are universally despised by all other ethnic groups, and live segregated, generally without any land or water rights. They are strictly [[Endogamy|endogamous]] and are often considered untouchable by the members of other groups. These sentiments are reciprocated by the Haddad, who maintain a high view of their group. Recently, Haddad members, because of the decline of their monopoly of blacksmithry caused by importation, have started migrating to the Sudanese towns, living beside other ethnic groups.

[[Lesotho]] is a source and transit country for women and children subjected to [[human trafficking|trafficking in persons]], specifically conditions of [[forced labor]] and [[forced prostitution]], and for men in forced labor. Women and children are subjected within Lesotho to [[involuntary servitude|involuntary domestic servitude]] and children, to a lesser extent, to [[commercial sexual exploitation]]. [[Basotho]] victims of transnational trafficking are most often taken to [[South Africa]]. Long-distance truck drivers offer to transport women and girls looking for legitimate employment in South Africa. En route, some of these women and girls are [[rape]]d by the truck drivers, then later prostituted by the driver or an associate. Many men who migrate voluntarily to South Africa to work illegally in agriculture and mining become victims of labor trafficking. Victims work for weeks or months for no pay; just before their promised "pay day" the employers turn them over to authorities to be deported for immigration violations. Women and children are exploited in South Africa in involuntary domestic servitude and [[commercial sex]], and some girls may still be brought to South Africa for [[forced marriage]]s in remote villages. Some Basotho women who voluntarily migrate to South Africa seeking work in domestic service become victims of traffickers, who detain them in prison-like conditions and force them to engage in prostitution. Most internal and transnational traffickers operate through informal, loose associations and acquire victims from their families and neighbors. Chinese and reportedly [[Nigerian]] [[organized crime]] units, however, acquire some Basotho victims while transporting foreign victims through Lesotho to [[Johannesburg]], where they "distribute" victims locally or move them overseas. Bathoso children who have [[AIDS orphan|lost at least one parent]] to [[HIV/AIDS in Lesotho|HIV/AIDS]] are more vulnerable to traffickers' manipulations; older children trying to feed their siblings are most likely to be lured by a trafficker's fraudulent job offer.&lt;ref name="dos"&gt;"Lesotho". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142760.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Lesotho]] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. While operating under severe resource constraints, the government formed an active multi-sectoral [[task force]], created a national plan of action, trained more officials to identify trafficking situations and victims, and raised public awareness. Despite these efforts, however, the government has shown no evidence of efforts to combat human trafficking through [[Lesotho#Law|law enforcement]] activities, and protections for victims are still minimal. U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The government did not increase its law enforcement efforts during the past year, and no suspected trafficking offenders were identified during the reporting period. Lesotho has no comprehensive anti-trafficking law, which hinders the government's ability to address human trafficking. Lesotho does not prohibit all forms of trafficking in persons, though its Constitution prohibits slavery, servitude, and forced labor.&lt;ref name=con&gt;"Constitution of Lesotho".  [http://www.lesotho.gov.ls/documents/Lesotho_Constitution.zip The Lesotho Government Portal].&lt;/ref&gt; The Child Protection Act of 1980, the Sexual Offenses Act of 2003, the Common Law, and the Labor Code Order of 1981, as amended, prescribe sufficiently stringent penalties of at least five years' imprisonment for crimes that could be used to prosecute trafficking offenses. The Child Protection and Welfare Bill, drafted in 2005, was approved by the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] in 2009 and is currently awaiting debate in [[Parliament of Lesotho|Parliament]]. It prohibits [[child trafficking]] and prescribes sufficiently stringent penalties of 20 years' imprisonment for trafficking offenders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.yale.edu/rcw/rcw/jurisdictions/afs/lesotho/les_ch_welfare_bill.htm "The Child Protection and Welfare Bill."]&lt;/ref&gt; No current or draft laws specifically prohibit the trafficking of adults. The government did not provide official data on trafficking or trafficking-related prosecutions or convictions during the reporting period. The Multi-Sectoral Committee, an anti-trafficking task force, in partnership with a local [[NGO]], arranged for and participated in three trafficking workshops. The session in October 2009 particularly targeted police and immigration officials, and focused on identifying trafficking offenders and their victims, as well as identifying laws that could be used to prosecute traffickers under Lesotho's existing legal system. While officials opened no official investigations into trafficking activity in Lesotho, the Lesotho Mounted Police Service worked with South African police to investigate suspected trafficking cases in border areas. Each month, immigration officers at the [[Maseru]] border post assisted approximately 20–30 victims of labor trafficking, usually men exploited in forced labor before being [[deported]] from South Africa. Law enforcement officers did not proactively identify victims among other vulnerable populations, such as women and children in prostitution, and most were not trained to identify victims they may encounter as part of their normal duties. There was no evidence of government involvement in or tolerance of trafficking on a local or institutional level.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The Lesotho government took minimal steps to protect victims of trafficking over the last year. Most officials did not proactively identify victims, and agencies have no formal mechanism for referring victims to service providers. Lesotho has no care facilities specifically for trafficking victims. Orphanages supported by the Government of Lesotho and NGOs are available to provide some services to children presumed to be [[trafficking of children|victims of trafficking]]. Staff from the Child and Gender Protection Unit (CGPU) of the Lesotho Mounted Police Service provided counseling to women and children who were victims of abuse, including some they believe were trafficking victims. The government acknowledged the need for safe shelter for victims and included the need in its draft anti-trafficking national plan of action. Basotho law does not protect victims from prosecution or otherwise being penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked, nor does it provide foreign victims with legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they may face hardship or retribution.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The Government of Lesotho clearly increased its efforts to prevent trafficking. The Multi-Sectoral Committee on Trafficking, which was formed in July 2009 and is composed of representatives of [[government ministry|government ministries]], NGOs, police, border security, the judicial system, [[UNDP]], [[UNICEF]], academia, and [[religious institute]]s met regularly and began working on a national plan of action. The action plan was nearly complete in early 2010. The government requested and received funding from UNDP to research trafficking in Lesotho; the Ministry of Home Affairs is expected to make the final report available in mid-2010. Authorities conducted several high-visibility information campaigns during the past year, spurring a sharp rise in the number of news reports about human trafficking. Campaigns run in partnership with the [[Government of South Africa]] targeted large border towns where trafficking is likely more prevalent. The CGPU and partners in local communities conducted awareness workshops, and trained other officers in the Lesotho Mounted Police on victim awareness and identification. UNICEF helped the CGPU to distribute educational materials on human trafficking. The Minister of Home Affairs presided over the launch of an NGO's [http://www.redlight2010campaign.org Red Light 2010 Campaign], which addressed sex trafficking in the context of the [[World Cup 2010|World Cup in South Africa]] in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redlight2010campaign.org "The Red Light 2010 Campaign."]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of national campaigns against [[gender-based violence]], [[child sexual abuse]], and human trafficking, the government made efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The [[Central African Republic|Central African Republic (CAR)]] is a source and destination country for children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically various forms of [[forced labor]] and [[forced prostitution]]. Most child victims are trafficked within the country, but a smaller number move back and forth from [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], [[Nigeria]], [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and [[Sudan]]. Trafficking offenders, including members of expatriate communities from Nigeria, Sudan, and Chad, as well as transient merchants and herders, subject children to [[involuntary servitude|involuntary domestic servitude]], [[commercial sexual exploitation of children|commercial sexual exploitation]], or forced labor in agriculture, [[Mining industry of the Central African Republic|diamond mines]], and street vending. The groups most at risk for trafficking are children for forced labor, Ba’aka (Pygmy) minorities for forced agricultural work, and girls for the sex trade in urban centers. The [[Lord’s Resistance Army]] continues to abduct and harbor enslaved Sudanese, Congolese, Central African, and Ugandan children in the CAR for use as cooks, porters, and combatants; some of these children are also taken back and forth across borders into Sudan or the Democratic Republic of the Congo.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

Human rights observers reported that opposition militia groups in the north of the country continued to [[military use of children|unlawfully conscript children]] as young as 12 years old in armed service. Two of the main rebel groups, however, [[Union of Democratic Forces for Unity|the Union of Democratic Forces for Unity (UFDR)]] and the [[Army for the Restitution of Democracy|Army for the Restitution of Democracy (APRD)]], ceased all recruitment of children during the reporting period as a result of disarmament, demobilization, and reinsertion activities. [[UNICEF]] reported that the APRD released 711 child soldiers in 2009; approximately 30 percent were between 10 and 14 years old, and of those, 70 percent had served in armed combat. The UFDR demobilized 180 child soldiers during the year. Though the UFDR and APRD deny the presence of additional children in their ranks, some observers believe they still harbor children between the ages of 15 and 17 years old. Village self-defense units, some of which are government-supported, used children as combatants, lookouts, and porters during the year; UNICEF estimates that children comprise one-third of the self-defense units.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The [[Government of the Central African Republic]] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources, cross-border incursions from three neighboring countries, and chronic political instability. In 2010, the government enacted an amendment to its penal code prohibiting and prescribing punishments for human trafficking offenses. The [[Minister of Justice (Central African Republic)|Minister of Justice]], however, suspended the activities of the [[Inter-ministerial Committee to Fight Child Exploitation]], pending a review of the draft Family Code to ensure that the legislation authorizes such a committee to exist and act effectively; this new code will determine the legal framework of the inter-ministerial committee’s work. The government did not take law enforcement action against traffickers, identify or provide protective services to child trafficking victims, or adequately raise public awareness of the phenomenon during the reporting period.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Central African Republic". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 3"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
While the government failed to investigate, prosecute, or convict trafficking offenses during the reporting period, it made efforts to strengthen its anti-trafficking legal statutes. In September 2009, [[Parliament of the Central African Republic|the Parliament]] passed a revised Penal Code containing anti-trafficking provisions; the Code was officially enacted in January 2010. Under Article 151 of the new provisions, the prescribed penalty for human trafficking ranges from five to 10 years’ imprisonment; however, when a child is the victim of sex trafficking or forced labor similar to slavery, the penalty is [[life imprisonment]] with [[hard labor]]. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious offenses, such as rape. Articles 7 and 8 of the January 2009 Labor Code prohibit forced and bonded labor and prescribe penalties of five to 10 years’ imprisonment. These provisions, however, are rarely enforced and no cases of suspected human trafficking offenses were investigated or prosecuted during the reporting period.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The government provided minimal protective assistance to trafficking victims during the reporting period. An extreme shortage of resources leaves responsible Central African officials unable to implement many basic victim protection services. While the Ministry of Family and Social Affairs continued operation of a shelter (the Center for Mothers and Children) in [[Bangui]] for children in distress, some of whom may have been trafficking victims, the shelter often did not have space available to take on additional clients. The government did not establish a system for identifying victims of trafficking among vulnerable populations, and they lacked capacity to provide funding or in-kind support to local or foreign partners for services provided to victims. The government sustained its partnership with UNICEF and UNICEF's two program implementers for the latter’s protection of demobilized child soldiers, some of whom had likely been subjected to unlawful conscription. For example, during the reporting period, the Sous Prefets of Paoua and Bocaranga facilitated communication between two international NGOs and the APRD, which enabled the effective demobilization of 623 child soldiers from the rebel group. The Ministry of Education’s local representative in [[Bocaranga]] welcomed the demobilized children into the school, despite local suspicions. In September 2009, the Minister of Interior traveled to [[Paoua]], in partnership with police, and convinced local citizens to peaceably allow the continuation of one NGO’s program to demobilize and rehabilitate child soldiers, including those unlawfully conscripted, from the APRD. In January 2010, the Deputy Minister of Defense tasked a senior gendarmerie official with investigating the situation of the recruitment and use of child soldiers in government-supported self-defense militias, with an eye to ending the practice immediately; the outcome of this investigation is unknown.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The Ministry of Justice ensured that identified victims were not penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. It claimed to encourage victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers, and to file suits against them for damages; these options do not appear to have been used during the reporting period. The government does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or retribution, and does not offer assistance to its own nationals who are repatriated as victims of trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The government acknowledged that human trafficking is a problem in the country, and undertook few anti-trafficking prevention efforts during the reporting period. Most visibly, officials launched a human trafficking awareness campaign in June 2009 to coincide with the annual [[Day of the African Child]], though there was limited follow-up on the themes presented after the day of the event. In January 2010, the Minister of Interior spoke on national radio about the overall poor law and order situation in the country, referencing in particular problems of child trafficking. The Inter-Ministerial Committee to Fight Child Exploitation, which was suspended by the Minister of Justice in early 2008 pending a review of the draft Family Code to ensure the legislation authorized the existence of such a committee, was not reinstituted in 2009. The government did not take any measures to reduce the demand for forced labor or commercial sex acts during the year.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

{{Main article|Criminal procedure|Criminal law}}

[[Indonesia]] is a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] country with five major codes. Its [[criminal procedure]] code, the [http://defensewiki.ibj.org/images/6/62/Indonesia_Law_of_Criminal_Procedure.pdf Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Acara Pidana ("KUHAP")], determines the procedures and rights of individuals at different stages of the [[trial]] process.

== Brief History of Indonesia's Criminal Procedure ==

=== Colonial Times ===

Before 1910, “Hukum Adat” or Adat laws applied in Indonesia. When the Dutch colonized Indonesia in 1910, they set up a [[civil law system]] that took precedence over the Adat laws. In terms of the criminal procedure, for example, the Dutch enacted two [[statute]]s to govern different parts of Indonesia. The ''Herziene Inlandsch/Indonesisch Reglement'' ("HIR")&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ladvolaw.com/indonesian-overview.html (accessed 15 September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; applied to Jawa and Madura, while the ''Rechtsreglement Buitengewesten'' ("Rbg")  applied to the rest of Indonesia. The Adat laws applied to the [[natives]] only if it did not clash with the Dutch statutory provisions.&lt;ref&gt;''IDE Asian Law Series No. 8'', Achmad Ali, Law and Development in Changing Indonesia&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japanese Occupation ===

When the Japanese occupied Indonesia in March 1942, they applied their Japanese [[Martial Law]]. This superseded all existing laws in Indonesia at that time.

=== Present ===

Today, Indonesia’s legal system is based on Dutch Colonial Law, Adat Law and National Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Strang|2008|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;http://www.lu.se/images/Syd_och_sydostasienstudier/working_papers/mason.pdf at p4 (accessed 14 September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

After Indonesia gained [[independence]] in August 1945, it adopted the Dutch HIR as its code of criminal procedure. In 1981, Indonesia replaced HIR with the KUHAP. The KUHAP improved upon the HIR by adding [[adversarial system|adversarial]] features to the criminal procedure. However, the KUHAP does not sufficiently protect [[human rights]] and its safeguards are often ignored in practice because there are no penalties for failing to comply with the Act.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt; In response to dissatisfaction with the formal procedures in the Act, a working group drafted a new statue to replace the KUHAP in 2000. However, Indonesia has not adopted the working group's recommendations to date.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;

== Steps involved in an ordinary criminal trial ==

[[File:Criminal Process in Indonesia (2).jpg|thumb|Criminal Trial Process in Indonesia|400px|left]]

=== Arrest ===

The police must produce a [[arrest warrant|warrant]] upon arrest if the suspect is not "caught in the act".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 18(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They must also send a copy of such warrant to the suspect’s family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 18(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Detention ===

Suspects must be released within one day of arrest&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 19(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless the investigator, prosecutor, or judge orders a [[Remand (detention)|detention]]. Detention is limited to offences liable to imprisonment of 5 years or more, and crimes under Art 21(4)(b).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 21(4)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suspects may be detained for a maximum of 60 days without [[judiciary|judicial]] consent.

=== Investigation ===

Investigators must inform the public prosecutor before they begin their investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 109(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the investigation is terminated due to insufficient evidence or if the event does not constitute an [[offence (law)|offence]], investigators must inform the prosecutor and suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 109(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During investigation, investigators have the authority to summon [[witness]]es for examination.

When the investigation is completed, investigators must promptly submit the dossier of the case to the public prosecutor. If the public prosecutor believes that the investigation is incomplete, he will return the dossier and order for a supplementary investigation.&lt;ref name="Art110"&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dossier is then resubmitted.

=== Prosecution ===

After examining the dossier of the case, the public prosecutor will determine if the case meets the requirements to be brought to court. If he decides to prosecute, he must prepare a Bill of [[Indictment]] and bring the action before an appropriate district court.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 140(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summonses will then be issued to the suspect and witnesses, if any, to attend trial.

If the public prosecutor decides to cease prosecution, he must produce a written decision to be sent to suspect, investigator, and the judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 140(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Please refer to the [[Indonesian Criminal Procedure#Appendix|appendix]] for more information about the structure of Indonesia's Public Prosecution Service.

=== Pre-trial proceedings ===

Pre-trial proceedings are limited to examining whether the arrest and/or detention was legal and to decide whether the district court has the jurisdiction to try the case.

=== Trial procedures ===

At the outset of trial, the prosecutor will read out the Bill of Indictment. The judge will then summon the accused and witnesses to give their [[testimony|testimonies]], which will then be examined. The head judge will lead the examination at trial. The prosecutor and the legal counsel may question the witnesses through the head judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 164(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
If an accused refuses to answer a question, the head judge will suggest that he answer and thereafter continue the examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 175}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After examination, the prosecutor will submit his charges before the accused submits his defence. The prosecutor may reply to the defences put up, provided that the accused has a right to reply.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 182(1)(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head judge will then consult other judges on the bench before he reaches a decision.

=== Judgment ===

The court will acquit the accused if guilt has not been legally and convincingly proven or dismiss all charges if the acts do not constitute an offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 191(1) and 191(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
If the court concludes that the accused is guilty of committing the offence, it will impose a punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 193(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public prosecutor will then execute the [[judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The appeal process ==

=== Ordinary legal remedies ===
[[File:Appeals procedure.jpg|thumb|The Appeal Process|400px]]
Once a decision has been reached and read by the judge in a General Court of first instance, the aggrieved party may file an [[appeal]] to the relevant court of appeal within seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 233(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No appeal can be filed against a:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
# Judgment of [[acquittal]] that relates to an inappropriate application of law; or
# Judgment of dismissal of all charges that relates to an inappropriate application of law; or
# Judgment under express procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 204 &amp; 205}}&lt;/ref&gt; A judgment is made under express procedure when only one judge adjudicates the case because it is clear and minor.

There are three grounds for appealing to the High Court:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Where a [[procedural law|law of procedure]] has been negligently applied;
# Where a mistake is found in the examination at first instance;
# Where something is incomplete in the examination at first instance.

After the High Court passes a judgment on an appeal, the aggrieved party can appeal to the Supreme Court as a matter of cassation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three grounds for appealing to the Supreme Court:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Where a legal rule has not been applied or has been applied in an improper manner;
# Where the method of adjudication was not concluded according to the provisions of law;
# Where the court has exceeded the limits of its competence.

=== Extraordinary legal remedies ===

Judgments are final and binding at the last appellate level. However a convicted person or his family may seek a final extraordinary remedy by submitting a request to the Supreme Court for reconsideration of the judgment, except when it is a judgment of acquittal or the dismissal of charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a request is not time-barred&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 264(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and may only be made once.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 268(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A request for reconsideration of a judgment may be made when:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# New circumstances give rise to a strong presumption that had such circumstances been known during the trial, there would have been an acquittal or dismissal of all charges, or the charges of the public prosecutor would not have been acceptable, or that a less severe criminal provisions would have applied to the case.
# Matters or circumstances that form the basis and reasoning of the judgment are declared contradictory.
# A judgment clearly displays a mistake made by the judge or a manifest error.
# An alleged act which has been declared proven in the judgment, but has not been followed up by the imposition of a penalty.

== Role of the judge ==
[[File:IndonesianSupremeCourt.jpg|Indonesia Supreme Court|thumb|left|240px]]
The role of judges in the Indonesian criminal justice system is to impose a proper punishment on offenders based on a sufficient means of legal proof. Judges are generally only involved in the trial proceedings.
 
When a judge receives a Bill of Indictment from the Public Prosecutor, he will determine a trial date and order the latter to summon the accused and witnesses to attend the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
During the trial proceedings, the judge is obliged to ensure that the defendant or witness remains free to answer the questions posed. If the judge fails to do so, his decision will be annulled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 153}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the end of the trial proceedings, the judge can only convict a person if he has at least two pieces of legal evidence supporting the conviction.&lt;ref name="Art183"&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the evidence presented, the judge can punish, acquit or dismiss the charges against the accused.
 
If the accused is convicted and he is sentenced to a punishment that deprives him of his [[liberty]], the judge will assist the head judge to supervise the execution of the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of the prosecutors ==

The Public Prosecution Service of Indonesia is the only agency that has state powers to prosecute offenders. As such, there is no private prosecution in the Indonesian criminal justice system.

Prosecutors are involved in the whole trial process, from the investigations, to trial proceedings and the execution of punishment. At the investigation stage, the prosecutor supervises the police’s investigations. The prosecutor only personally investigates cases when there are special crimes, such as [[corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the police complete investigations, they hand the [[evidence]] to the prosecutor.&lt;ref name="Art110"/&gt; If the evidence is satisfactory,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; the prosecutor will prosecute the offender at an appropriate court.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 143}}&lt;/ref&gt; He will prepare a Bill of Indictment for the judge&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 140}}&lt;/ref&gt; to begin the trial proceedings.
 
During the trial proceedings, the prosecutor must ensure that the defendant, witnesses and experts are all present. The prosecutor must also present all evidence concerning the crime.&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.unafei.or.jp/english/pdf/RS_No53/No53_22PA_Zaimaru.pdf" (accessed 15 September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the prosecutor usually presents three or more pieces of legal evidence to support the defendant’s guilt.
 
After the judge has passed judgment on the case, the judge’s clerk will send a copy of the execution of punishment to the prosecutor. The prosecutor will then execute the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal protections for the accused ==

=== Rights to counsel ===

A suspect has a right to obtain legal assistance from one or more legal [[counsel]]s at every stage of the examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the start of the investigations, the police will inform the suspect of his right to receive legal assistance during examination at trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the suspect does not have legal assistance, he will receive free [[legal aid]] if he faces the [[Capital punishment in Indonesia|death penalty]], or imprisonment of fifteen years or more. The suspect will also receive free legal aid if he is destitute and faces imprisonment of five year or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 56(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the suspect obtains legal assistance, the counsel has a right to contact him from the moment he is arrested or detained.  The counsel also has a right to be present at, and listen to, [[interrogation]]s. This ensures that the police do not carry out unfair interrogation techniques.

=== Rules of evidence ===

The court only admits five types of legal evidence. They are:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 184}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The testimony of a witness
# The testimony of an expert
# A document
# An indication
# The testimony of the accused

In terms of the witness' testimony as a means of legal proof, the judge will compare a witness’ testimony against other witness testimonies or other means of proof to determine whether the testimony is true. In the process, he also considers all other factors that affect the witness’ credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 185(6)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A witness usually makes a testimony under [[oath]]. However, a testimony not made under oath can still be admitted as supplemental legal evidence if it is consistent with a testimony made under oath.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 185(5)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for an indication as a means of legal proof, an indication is an act, event, or situation that is consistent with other facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 188(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can only be obtained from the testimony of a witness or accused, or from a document.

To convict an accused, a judge must have at least two means of legal proof to support the charge.&lt;ref name="Art183"/&gt; This ensures that a suspect cannot be convicted merely because he confessed his guilt.

== Current controversies and debates ==

=== Problems concerning evidence ===

Indonesian courts only acc have a clear provision on the admissibility of illegally obtained evidence. Hence, the prosecution can present evidence that was obtained through torture, ill-treatment, or contrary to any provision in the KUHAP. Furthermore, there is no judicial avenue for an accused to seek redress if illegal evidence were presented at trial. This undermines the legal safeguards in the KUHAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Strang|2008|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restricted rights to counsel ===

Counsel has a right to contact his client “at every moment.” However, this right is undermined because a 1983 Ministry of Justice regulation interprets the phrase to mean that the client has a right to communicate with his counsel ‘at every moment during office hours’. Based on this, police stations mysteriously close when lawyers visit their clients. This prevents the counsel from communicating with his client, undermining the suspect’s right to counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lindsey|2008|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abuse of detention powers ===

The police can abuse its powers to detain a suspect by using threats of detention to pressure a suspect to confess that he is guilty. In addition, the KUHAP does not ensure that detainees are brought to court promptly. Under the KUHAP, a suspect can be detained for up to 60 days without judicial intervention. For example, if the police detains a suspect for 20 days under Art24(1), a prosecutor can extend this detention for another 40 days under Art 24(2).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lindsey|2008|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Please refer to the [[Indonesian Criminal Procedure#Appendix|appendix]] for more information about how long a suspect can be detained without judicial intervention.

=== Fictional right to silence ===

Finally, it is unclear whether an accused has a right to remain silent during examination. Although an accused “shall not be burdened with the duty of giving evidence”,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|KUHAP|1981|loc=Art 66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Art 175 seems to undermine this right. Under Art 175, the head judge can suggest that the accused answers the question. The examination will continue after the head judge makes this suggestion. However, since there is a high respect for authority in Indonesia, the head judge's “suggestion” will probably persuade the accused to answer the question. This undermines the right to remain silent during examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lindsey|2008|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Industrial action''' ([[Commonwealth English]]) or '''job action''' ([[North American English]]) is a temporary show of dissatisfaction by employees, especially a strike or [[slowdown]] or [[working to rule]] to protest against bad working conditions or low pay and to increase bargaining power with the employer and intended to force the employer to improve them by reducing [[productivity]] in a workplace.&lt;ref name=ahd&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=job%20action American Heritage Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/job%20action Merriam-Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/job-action Collins English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial action is usually organized by [[trade union]]s or other [[organised labour]], most commonly when employees are forced out of work due to contract termination and without reaching an agreement with the employer. Quite often it is used and interpreted as a [[euphemism]] for [[strike action|strike]] or [[mass strike]], but the scope is much wider. Industrial action may take place in the context of a labour dispute or may be meant to effect political or social change. This form of communication tends to be their only means to voice their concerns about safety and benefits.

It is also a legal term used to refer to almost the opposite phenomenon, an action taken by an employer that affects an employee's terms of employment, especially adversely.&lt;ref name=ahd/&gt;

The '''lauburu''' or '''Basque cross''' ({{lang-eu|lauburu}}, "four heads") is a traditional Basque hooked cross with four [[comma (punctuation)|comma]]-shaped heads. Today, it is a symbol of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] and the unity of the [[Basque people]]. It is also associated with Celtic peoples, most notably [[Galicians]] and [[Asturians]]. It can be constructed with a compass and straightedge, beginning with the formation of a square template; each head can be drawn from a neighboring vertex of this template with two compass settings, with one radius half the length of the other.

==Background==
[[Image:Marquise of Santa Cruz by Goya.jpg|thumb|The [[lyre]] of ''[[Joaquina Téllez-Girón, Marchioness of Santa Cruz]]'' by  [[Francisco de Goya]] (around 1805) is decorated with a lauburu.]]

Historians and authorities have attempted to apply [[allegory|allegorical]] meaning to the ancient symbol. Some say it signifies [[laurak Bat|the "four heads or regions"]] of the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]].&lt;!-- Broken link [http://www.bcbasque.com/HTMLfiles/lauburu.htm BCbasque.com] --&gt; The lauburu does not appear in any of the seven coats-of-arms that have been combined in the arms of the Basque Country: Higher and Lower [[Navarre]], [[Gipuzkoa]], [[Biscay]], [[Álava]], [[Labourd]], and [[Soule]]&lt;!-- Broken link [http://gofree.indigo.ie/~janoty/euskadi/zazpiak.htm Indigo.ie] --&gt;. The [[Basque people|Basque]] intellectual Imanol Muxika liked to say that the heads signify spirit, life, consciousness, and form&lt;!-- Broken link [http://www.bcbasque.com/HTMLfiles/lauburu.htm BCbasque.com] --&gt;, but it is generally used as a [[symbol]] of prosperity.

After the time of the [[Antonines]], [[Camille Jullian]]&lt;ref name="Camille"&gt;M. Camille Jullian in his preface to ''La tombe basque'', according to [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/87432?idi=en&amp;clave=87432&amp;op=4&amp;primR=21&amp;regs=10&amp;EIKVOGEN=lauburu&amp;pos=29&amp;epi=64714#mrc1 Lauburu: La swástika rectilínea] (Auñamendi Entziklopedia).&lt;/ref&gt; finds no specimen of hooked crosses, round nor straight, in the Basque area until modern times.
[[Paracelsus]]'s ''[[Archidoxis Magicae]]'' features a symbol&lt;ref name="Paracelsus"&gt;[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/38522?idi=en&amp;op=15&amp;primR=21&amp;regs=10&amp;EIKVOGEN=lauburu&amp;pos=29&amp;img=6&amp;voz=87432 Picture] in the [[Auñamendi Entziklopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the lauburu that is to be drawn to heal animals.
[[M. Colas]] considers that the lauburu is not related to the swastika but comes from Paracelsus and marks the tombs of healers of animals and healers of souls (i.e. priests).
Around the end of the 16th century, the lauburu appears abundantly as a Basque decorative element, in wooden chests or tombs, perhaps as another form of the cross.&lt;ref name="Conclusiones"&gt;[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/87432?idi=en&amp;clave=87432&amp;op=4&amp;primR=21&amp;regs=10&amp;EIKVOGEN=lauburu&amp;pos=29&amp;epi=64716#mrc3 Lauburu: Conclusiones] in Auñamendi Entziklopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;
Straight swastikas are not found until the 19th century.
Many Basque homes and shops display the symbol over the doorway as a sort of [[amulet|talisman]]. 
[[Sabino Arana]] interpreted it as a [[solar symbol]], supporting his theory of a Basque [[Sun worship|solar cult]] based on wrong etymologies, in the first number of ''[[Euzkadi]]''.
The lauburu has been featured on flags and emblems of various Basque political organisations including [[Eusko Abertzale Ekintza]] (EAE-ANV). 

The use of the lauburu as a cultural icon fell into some disuse under the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist dictatorship]], which repressed many elements of Basque culture.

==Etymology==
''Lau buru'' means "four heads", "four ends" or "four summits" in Basque. Some{{who?|date=April 2014}} argue this might be a [[folk etymology]] applied to the  Latin ''[[labarum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euskaltzaindia.net/index.php?option=com_oeh&amp;view=frontpage&amp;Itemid=413&amp;lang=eu |title=Orotariko Euskal Hiztegia |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |work= |publisher=Euskaltzaindia |accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Father [[Fidel Fita]] thought the relation reversed, ''labarum'' being adapted from Basque, under [[Augustus Caesar]]'s rule.&lt;ref name="Fita"&gt;Letter from Fita to Fernández Guerra, reproduced in his ''Cantabria'', note 8, page 126, reproduced in ''Historia crítica de Vizcaya y de sus Fueros'', by [[Gregorio Balparda]], according to [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/87432?idi=en&amp;clave=87432&amp;op=4&amp;primR=21&amp;regs=10&amp;EIKVOGEN=lauburu&amp;pos=29&amp;epi=64714#mrc1 Auñamendi Entziklopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Posthumous===
Many prizes, medals, and awards can be granted [[Wiktionary:posthumously|posthumously]]. Australian actor [[Heath Ledger]], for example, won [[List of awards and nominations received by Heath Ledger|many awards]] after his death in 2008. Military decorations, such as the [[Medal of Honor]], are often given posthumously.

Less commonly, certain prizes, medals, and awards are granted ''only'' posthumously, especially those that honor people who died in service to a particular cause. Such awards include:
*[[Dag Hammarskjöld Medal]] &amp;ndash; to military personnel, police, or civilians who lost their lives while serving in a [[United Nations]] [[peacekeeping operation]]

Activities vary widely from transcribing old ship logbooks to digitize the data as part of the [[Old Weather]] project to observing and counting birds at home or in the field for [[eBird]].&lt;ref name=seattle&gt;{{cite news|last=Mapes|first=Lynda V.|title=Citizen scientists can be climate sleuths too|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2020373355_citizensciencexml.html|accessdate=18 February 2013|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Robbins|first=Jim|title=Crowdsourcing, for the birds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/science/earth/crowdsourcing-for-the-birds.html?_r=0|accessdate=20 May 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation can be as simple as playing a computer game for a project called [[Eyewire]] that may help scientists learn more about [[retina]]l [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref name=eye&gt;{{cite web|title=Update: EyeWire|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/citizen-science/project.cfm?id=update-eyewire-mit|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be more in depth, such as when citizens collect water quality data over time to assess the health of local waters, or help discover and name new species of insect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schilthuizen|first=Menno|last2=Seip|first2=Lilian|last3=Otani|first3=Sean|last4=Suhaimi|first4=Jadda|last5=Njunjić|first5=Iva|date=2017-06-12|title=Three new minute leaf litter beetles discovered by citizen scientists in Maliau Basin, Malaysian Borneo (Coleoptera: Leiodidae, Chrysomelidae)|url=https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.5.e21947|journal=Biodiversity Data Journal|language=en|volume=5|doi=10.3897/bdj.5.e21947|issn=1314-2828}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://acwi.gov/monitoring/vm/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; An emerging branch of Citizen Science are Community Mapping projects that utilize smartphone and tablet technology. For example, TurtleSAT&lt;ref&gt;http://turtlesat.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; is a community mapping project that is mapping freshwater turtle deaths throughout Australia.

Lists of citizen science projects may change. For example, the Old Weather project website indicates that {{As of|2015|01|10|alt=as of}} January 10, 2015, 51% of the logs were completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=old Weather|url=http://www.oldweather.org/|publisher=Zooniverse|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When that project reaches 100 percent, it will move to the completed list.

There are more than 1,100 active and searchable global citizen science projects listed on the [[SciStarter]] website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scistarter.com SciStarter]&lt;/ref&gt;

Below is a list of projects that rely on [[crowdsourcing]]. See also [[open innovation]].

{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes}}

== A ==
*[[Adaptive Vehicle Make]] is a project overseen by [[DARPA]] to crowdsource the design and manufacture of a new [[armoured vehicle]].
*AED4 allows members of the public to register locations of [[automated external defibrillator]]s (AEDs) online, to enable a nearby AED to be quickly located during an emergency using the AED4.US [[iPhone]] [[Mobile apps|app]] ([[Radboud University Nijmegen]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://aed4.us/?page=overAED Dutch language summary of the aed4.eu project] ([https://www.webcitation.org/65WcgV1EC?url=http://aed4.us/?page%3DoverAED WebCite archive]). [http://www.aed4.us/ Link to U.S. website aed4.us]. Project is discussed in a [[TED (conference)|TEDtalksDirector]] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWZP8cUEB7Y video] that was posted 2012-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Air Quality Egg]]s by WickedDevices are open-source hardware Internet of Things pollution monitors that facilitate citizen crowdsourcing of air quality readings
*[https://Ajapaik.ee Ajapaik.ee] is a platform for crowdsourcing geotags and [[Rephotography|rephotographs]] for historic view images (mostly photographs, but also paintings, graphic art). Most of the content is from Estonian public collections. By May 2017 almost 58 000 images have been geotagged on the platform. Since November 2016 there is also a Norwegian instance of Ajapaik platform: [https://Fotodugnad.ra.no Fotodugnad].
*[[Amara (subtitling)|Amara]] is a website that enables crowdsourced translations of videos from a variety of popular video hosting websites. The subtitles created are used to make online video content accessible to a wider audience, including the deaf and hard of hearing, and those who cannot understand the language of the source.
* In 2005, [[Amazon.com]] launched the [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]], a platform on which crowdsourcing tasks called "HITs" (Human Intelligence Tasks") can be created and publicized and people can execute the tasks and be paid for doing so. Dubbed "Artificial Artificial Intelligence", it was named after [[The Turk]], an 18th-century [[chess]]-playing "machine".
* americanairmuseum.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanairmuseum.com/ |title=American Air Museum in Britain|work=americanairmuseum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; crowdsources information about the men and women of the US Army Air Forces who served from the UK in the Second World War and the British civilians they met. It collects photographs and information. It was launched in October 2014 by [[Imperial War Museum|IWM]] as part of a project focused on the [[American Air Museum in Britain|American Air Museum]] at [[IWM Duxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanairmuseum.com/our-partners|title=Our Partners|work=americanairmuseum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The first crowdsourced documentary film is the non-profit "[[The American Revolution]]," which went into production in 2005, and which examines the role media played in the cultural, social and political changes from 1968 to 1974 through the story of underground, free-form radio station WBCN-FM in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;"Web Power to the People," The Boston Herald, September 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Glory Days of the Rock of Boston," Boston Globe, Op-Ed, July 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'BCN Documentary Looks for Archival Contributors," Boston Herald, August 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"WBCN and The American Revolution," The Huffington Post, August 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; When the project began, by seeking archival contributions from the public, the term "crowdsource" was not in use, and so the film was referred to as the "first open source documentary film." The film is being produced by Lichtenstein Creative Media and the non-profit Filmmakers Collaborative.
* [[Arcbazar]], American crowdsourcing platform for architectural design services, established in 2010 and is headquartered in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]
*Arkitekturbilleder.dk is a picture database documenting modern Danish architecture. Pictures are contributed by volunteer photographers with architectural education and background. 
*[[Article One Partners]], founded in 2008, is a community of technology experts who execute crowdsourced [[prior art search]] by researching and contributing information related to [[patents]].  By submitting research to the online platform, the community members compete for cash rewards, ranging from $5,000 to $50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/nov/24/internet-firm-reward-researchers-patents-evidence/ | work=The Washington Times | title=Internet Firm to Reward Researchers for Patent Evidence | date=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.businessinsider.com/patent-research-startup-article-one-partners-raises-5-million-2010-7 | work=Business Insider | title=Startup 2009 Winner Article One Partners Raises $5 Million | first=Nick | last=Saint | date=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*AstroDrone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrodrone.org/|title=Page Redirection|work=astrodrone.org}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a scientific crowdsourcing project of the [[European Space Agency]]. It involves a game for the [[Parrot AR.Drone]]. While players perform space missions in an augmented reality, visual features are extracted from the robot's camera images. If players agree to contribute to the experiment, these features are sent to a database. Analysis of the database is meant to improve robotic perception for tasks such as obstacle avoidance.
*Australian Historic Newspapers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ |title=trove.nla.gov.au |publisher=trove.nla.gov.au |accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided by the National Library of Australia encourages members of the public to correct/fix up/improve the electronically translated (OCR) text of old newspapers. This means the full-text search capability is instantly improved for everyone. The service was released in August 2008 and by March 2010 over 12 million lines of text had been improved by thousands of public users. This is the first library project in the world that has undertaken crowdsourcing on a large scale. The leader of the project Rose Holley is an advocate of using crowdsourcing to help libraries and archives expose and improve digital resources and has written articles about the Australian newspaper achievements&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/22531631 "Many Hands Make Light Work: Public Collaborative OCR Text Correction in Australian Historic Newspapers"] Report published by the National Library of Australia. March 2009. Retrieved 26-04-2010&lt;/ref&gt; and tips for libraries on how to crowdsource effectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march10/holley/03holley.html "Crowdsourcing – How and Why Should Libraries Do It?"] Article in D-Lib Magazine.

The term ''Majlis'' is also used to refer to a private place where guests, usually male, are received and entertained.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Frequently, the room has cushions placed around the walls where the visitors sit, either with the cushions placed directly on the floor or upon a raised shelf.

In many [[Arab]] homes, the majlis is the meeting room or front [[parlor]] used to entertain visitors. In [[Saudi Arabia]], the decoration of the majlis in the home is often the responsibility of the women of the house, who either decorate the area themselves or [[barter]] with other women to do it for them. In the [[Asir]] Province and in neighboring parts of [[Yemen]], geometric designs and bright colors are used in "majlis painting" or [[nagash painting]]. The term ''majlis'' is used to refer to a private place where house guests and friends are received and entertained. Because hospitality is taken seriously, many families take pride in making their guests comfortable when visiting.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Sometimes public waiting rooms are also called a majlis, since this is an area where people meet and visit. Here the traditional "majlis painting or [[nagash painting]] has been added to the [[interior design]] of the room. The provincial airport in [[Abha]] has recently been designed to reflect the cultural heritage of the region, an airport official said: “Abha is the first city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to have its airport decorated in a local-heritage style,” said Provincial Airport Director [[Abdul Aziz Abu Harba]]. “The seating arrangement at the airport lounge has been in the form of a traditional majlis and the walls are painted in various colors reflecting the natural beauty of Asir.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabnews.com/node/378076 MISHAAL AL-TAMIMI. 2011 “Abha airport reflects heritage.”] ARAB NEWS Thursday 19 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Najd]] province of Saudi Arabia, wall coverings include stars shapes and other geometric designs carved into the wall covering itself. "[[Courtyard]]s and upper pillared [[portico]]es are principal features of the best Nadjdi architecture, in addition to the fine incised plaster wood ([[jiss]]) and painted window shutters, which decorate the reception rooms. Good examples of plasterwork can often be seen in the gaping ruins of torn-down buildings- the effect is light, delicate and airy. It is usually around the majlis, around the coffee hearth and along the walls above where guests sat on rugs, against cushions. Doughty wondered if this "[[parquet]]ting of jis", this "[[gypsum]] fretwork... all adorning and unenclosed" originated from [[India]]. However, the Najd fretwork seems very different from that seen in the Eastern Province and [[Oman]], which are linked to Indian traditions, and rather resembles the motifs and patterns found in ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. The rosette, the star, the triangle and the stepped pinnacle pattern of dadoes are all ancient patterns, and can be found all over the [[Middle East]] of antiquity. [[Al-Qassim Region|Qassim]] seems to be the home of this art, and there it is normally worked in hard white [[plaster]] (though what you see is usually begrimed by the smoke of the coffee hearth). In [[Riyadh]], examples can be seen in unadorned [[clay]]."&lt;ref&gt;Mostyn, Trevor. 1983. Saudi Arabia. London: Middle East Economic Digest. Pages 257-258.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1965">The '''Malkana''' are a [[Muslim Rajput]] community found in [[Pakistan]] and [[North India]].

==History and origin==
In [[Agra District]], the Malkana claimed descent from a number of Hindu [[castes]]. Those of [[Kiraoli]], where they occupy five villages, claim descent from a [[Jat]]. Other Malkana families in the district claim descent from [[Parmar|Panwar]], [[Chauhan]], [[Parihar]] and Sikarwar Rajputs. In [[Hathras District]], they were found mainly near the town of [[Sadabad (India)|Sadabad]]. They belonged to Jat and [[Gaurwa]] communities that had converted to Islam. At the turn of the 20th century, the Malkana were a community that was on the religious faultline, as there customs were a mixture of Hindu and Muslim traditions. They kept Hindu names, used the salutation Ram Ram, and were endogamous. But the community buried their dead, practised circumcision, and visited mosques on special occasions. This eclectic nature of the community led to attempts by both Hindu and Muslim revivalist to target them. {{cn|date=April 2017}}

This has led to splits in the community, with many members of the community converted to Hinduism in the early part of the  20th century, during the course of the [[shuddhi]] movement. The shuddhi campaign among the Malkanas, was launched in early 1923 and led by the [[Arya Samaj]] under [[Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya]]. This re-conversion campaign reached its peak by the end of 1927, by which time some 1,63,000 Malkana Muslims are said to have been brought into the Hindu fold.&lt;ref&gt;''Hindu-Muslim Relations in British India: a study of Controversy, Conflict and Communal Movements in Northern India 1923 to 1928'', by Gene R.

The masculine psychology is the effect of [[Gender differences|gender differencing]], which was closely governed resulting Europe's western political and social control. Conflict of social structures became evident in society as there were beliefs in liberty through common resistance, such as [[Rebellions of 1837–1838|protest writing]]. Writers, artists, and liberalist alike rebelled from social structures through their forms of artistry.

== History ==

=== Influence from a Western Religion ===
{{Main|God and gender (disambiguation){{!}}God and gender}}
The original languages of several religions have gender-specific pronouns and verb conjugations. As language was constructed by man, references to [[God]] often use the masculine pronoun "He" and refer to [[God]] as masculine; social modernity enabled hegemonic language.

In many religions, including [[Judaism]], [[Sikhism]], and Islam, God has traditionally been referred to by using masculine pronouns. However, in the original Hebrew and Aramaic languages of the Old Testament, God is referred to by a variety of names, in both singular and plural forms, and so it is not clear that the use of a masculine pronoun necessarily conveys actual gender. For example, in Sikhism the use of masculine pronouns is due to grammatical conventions and does not signify actual gender. In [[Islam]], similarly, God is generally depicted as having a male gender, though there may be debate as to God's gender. As there is no neutral gender in Arabic, God is referred to in the masculine form by default, and it is universally understood that God (Allah) is not a woman.

In [[Mainstream Christianity]] God is understood as a [[Trinity]] of three persons in one God, consisting of Father, Son, and [[Holy Spirit]]. While in mainstream Christianity God is thought of in masculine terms, teachings generally state that God has no gender, except in his incarnation as Jesus Christ, due to the fact that He is a spiritual being. However, the names of Father and Son clearly imply masculinity, and the Gospel of John implies the masculinity of the Spirit by applying a masculine demonstrative pronoun to the grammatically neuter [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]]. Still, teachings regarding the gender and nature of God vary between Christian groups, and some clearly state that God is male. These include the teachings of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], which explicitly describe God the Father as being male, corporeal, and separate in being from the Son, Jesus Christ. Unusually, Latter-day Saint teachings also indicate the existence of a Heavenly Mother, who is the wife of the Heavenly Father, and that together they are the spiritual parents of humankind. This reinforces the idea that God is analogous to our earthly fathers. However, these beliefs are not common among Christian groups, which generally see God as having both male and female attributes and therefore no need for a female counterpart.

In many polytheistic religions, there are both gods and goddesses clearly defined. This includes many pagan religions, such as those involving [[Greek mythology]], [[Norse mythology]], and [[Celtic mythology]]. This distinction also exists in other polytheisms. For example, [[Hinduism]] distinguishes between God and Goddess. There are three main male gods known as Tridev (Sanskrit:त्रिदेव) and their wives are worshiped as goddesses. In Hindu mythology, all the forces converge to form a female supreme power known as aadishakti (Sanskrit: आदिशक्ति.).

The western masculine psychology derived from religious social structures that created ideologies of masculinity (and femininity).

{{See also|Masculinity}}

== Ideologies of Manhood ==
Among artists and scientists during the [[Renaissance]], it was the prevailing belief that the study of the male form was in itself a study of God. [[Michelangelo's David|Michelangelo's ''David'']] is based upon this artistic discipline, which is known as ''[[disegno]]''. Under this discipline, sculpture is considered to be the finest form of art because it mimics [[divinity|divine]] creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/visualarts/david_a.html|title=Culture Shock: Flashpoints: Visual Arts: Michelangelo's David|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[Michelangelo]] adhered to the concepts of ''disegno'', he worked under the premise that the image of ''David'' was already in the block of stone he was working on—in much the same way as the human [[soul]] is thought by some to be found within the physical body as concluded by [[psychoanalytic theory]].

Masculine identities or concepts are developed differently across cultures and subcultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=A3201C|title=Masculine Identities|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because masculinity can take varied forms, forms of manliness can be changed and utilized at once. Masculine identities are not limited to the archetypal male species, and can be [[Gender fluid|fluid]] in constructing a new identity outside of [[Gender binary|binary]] lenses.

== Law ==
The quest for control and understanding became the Britain's [[Victorian era|Victorian period]], and the creation of laws to fit societal structure was later the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment period]]. [[Law]]s stood in place to dictate order.

[[Sodomy law|Sodomy]] was a 1789 law that enforced masculinity in western culture, and specifically, sexual acts by men was deemed illegal. As this law was never repealed since, sodomy laws began to be used in a new way during the late 1960's - distinctly against people who identify as [[gay]]. As the [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movement]] began to make headway, and the social condemnation of being gay began to weaken, social conservatives invoked sodomy laws as a justification for discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aclu.org/other/why-sodomy-laws-matter|title=Why Sodomy Laws Matter|work=American Civil Liberties Union|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gradual [[liberalization]] of the Western sexuality, especially in Northern America, led government officials sodomy laws in most states. Several northern American states out-ruled sodomy in just 2003 and culture remains a continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alternet.org/story/99092/the_strange_history_of_sodomy_laws|title=The Strange History of Sodomy Laws|last=Canaday|first=Margot|date=2008-09-16|work=AlterNet|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the quest of control, literature was used to rebel against standard ideologies, for ambiguous forms of same-sex love had so significant during the Victorian culture; "homoaffectional" literature became, both, more explicit in its sexuality and much less common as time progressed. The lack of acknowledging sexual preferences outside of the binary social constructs are effects of an unchallenged masculine psychology.

==Literature==
Social standards of manliness or masculinity has been challenged as much as it is asserted in the Western culture. The study of masculine psychology has brought about the publication of many books, poems, and journals.

* '''Robert Bly'''

[[Robert Bly]] inspired the [[mythopoetic men's movement]] with his 1990 book ''[[Iron John: A Book About Men]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Iron John: A Book About Men|last=Bly|first=Robert|publisher=|year=1990|isbn=0-201-51720-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of retellings of archetypal male myths and analysis of the [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Grimms' Fairy Tale]] "Iron John".

* '''David Deida'''

[[David Deida]], a noted author and spiritual practitioner, published ''The Way Of The Superior Man: A Spiritual Guide to Mastering the Challenges of Woman, Work, and Sexual Desire'' in 1997. In this book he argues "It is time to evolve beyond the (first-stage) macho jerk ideal, all spine and no heart. It is also time to evolve beyond the (second-stage) sensitive and caring wimp ideal, all heart and no spine. Heart and spine must be united in a single man, and then gone beyond in the fullest expression of love and consciousness possible, which requires a deep relaxation into the infinite openness of this present moment. And this takes a new kind of (third-stage) guts. This is the way of the superior man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Way of the Superior Man: A Spiritual Guide to Mastering the challenges of Women, Work, and Sexual Desire|last=Deida|first=David|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=9781591792574|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary critiques of David Deida include the fact that he encourages men to express their sexuality in a manner that still reflects the same attitudes.

* '''Susan Faludi'''

[[Susan Faludi]], a noted feminist author, published ''[[Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man]]'' in 1999. In this book she claims that in the 20th century men suffered from the breakdown of patriarchal structures.

* '''Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette'''

[[Robert L. Moore]] and Douglas Gillette collaborated on a series of five books on male psychology and [[Mythopoetic men's movement|mythopoetic]] aspects of human development, including ''King, Warrior, Magician, Lover'', and a book exploring each of these four [[archetypes]]. The book and its authors are considered important parts of the [[men's movement]] in the latter part of the 20th century.

''The White Family of Man: Colonial Discourse and the Reinvention of Patriarchy'' (1994). "This text chronicles the dangerous liaisons between gender, race and class that shaped British [[British imperialism|imperialism]] and its bloody dismantling.

* '''Eugene Monick'''

In his books ''Phallos: Sacred Image of the Masculine'' and ''Castration and Male Rage'', Monick correlates male sexuality and spirituality, arguing that the "[[phallos]]" (erect penis) is something of an existential God-image for men. He also presents his thesis that there is a difference between [[masculinity]] and [[patriarchy]]. The author also argues that there is a deep need within men to participate in a [[Bachelor band|fraternity]] with men and to have their maleness recognized by other men, but that our society often does not take this into account. The author claims that what usually results is that these needs become frustrated and manifest themselves in often anti-social behavior and activities, such as [[hazing]] rituals.

* '''Dee Rees'''

Female Masculinity in [[Dee Rees]]'s ''Pariah'' is viewed through many different facets as it explores identity and sexuality. This film offers multiple definitions of the monolithic black feminist that is often thought of in a singular aspect. ''Pariah'' goes against the concept of a binary heterosexist expression of sexuality, for it challenges the concepts of “masculinity” and “aggressiveness” in women. All women who choose this form of sexuality are not limited to one definition of the “third gender”. This film represents the attitudes of the black community towards the “third gender” by revealing that African Americans can offer complex identity formation, which validates humanism in a patriarchal society.

* '''William Shakespeare'''

Shakespeare's works are politically influenced as the following plays comment on western [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] constructs such as family, monarch, nature, religion, law, and the Renaissance, respectively: ''Titus Andronicus'' (Family), ''Richard III'' (Monarchy), ''A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream'' (Nature), ''Hamlet'' (Religion), ''Measure for Measure'' (Law), ''Antony and Cleopatra'' (Renaissance).

==The male fear of the feminine==
The male fear of the feminine is a phenomenon that has been discussed since the 1930s. It was first introduced by the German psychoanalyst and critic of Freudian theory, [[Karen Horney]] (1932) in her paper titled "The Dread of Woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Horney | first = Karen | title = Observations on a specific difference in the dread felt by men and by women respectively for the opposite sex | journal = [[The International Journal of Psychoanalysis]] | volume = 13 | pages = 348&amp;ndash;360 | publisher = [[British Psychoanalytical Society|Institute of Psychoanalysis]] | date = 1932 | url = http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=ijp.013.0348a | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

Neumann regards "patriarchal normality as a form of fear of the feminine" (p.&amp;nbsp;261).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Neumann | first = Erich | title = The fear of the feminine and other essays on feminine psychology | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, N.J | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780691034744 }}
:(First published in German as: die Angst vor dem Weiblichen, 1959. Zürich: Racher Verlag)&lt;/ref&gt;

A later contributor is Chris Blazina, a psychodynamic psychologist and professor based at Tennessee State University. Blazina considers that "the fear of the feminine helps define what is masculine" (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Blazina | first = Chris | title = The fear of the feminine in the Western psyche and the masculine task of disidentification: their effect on the development of masculine gender role conflict | journal = [[The Journal of Men's Studies]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 55&amp;ndash;68 | publisher = [[Sage Publishing|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/106082659700600103 | date = October 1997 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/106082659700600103 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/106082659700600103 Pdf.]

He developed a 37-question psychometric test, a gender role conflict scale (GRCS), to measure the extent to which a man is in conflict with traditional masculine role values. This test is built upon the notion of the male fear of the feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Neil | first1 = James M. | last2 = Helms | first2 = Barbara J. | last3 = Gable | first3 = Robert K. | last4 = David | first4 = Laurence | last5 = Wrightsman | first5 = Lawrence S. | title = Gender-role conflict scale: College men's fear of femininity | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 14 | issue = 5&amp;ndash;6 | pages = 335&amp;ndash;350 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/BF00287583 | date = March 1986 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00287583 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Werner Kierski, a London-based German-born psychotherapist and researcher, associated with [[humanistic psychology]] and [[transpersonal]] and [[existential psychotherapy]] designed the first empirical research into the male fear of the feminine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kierski | first = Werner | title = Female violence: can we therapists face up to it? | journal = Counselling and Psychotherapy Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 32&amp;ndash;35 | publisher = [[British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy]] (BACP) | date = December 2002 | url = http://www.dewar4research.org/DOCS/kierski.pdf | issn = 1474-5372 | ref = harv | postscript = . | deadurl = bot: unknown | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161209212508/http://www.dewar4research.org/DOCS/kierski.pdf | archivedate = 2016-12-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the results published in 2007 and presented to the public at the 2007 annual conference of the American Men's Studies Association (AMSA) and at the 2007 research conference of the [[British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy]] (BACP).&lt;ref name="Kierski_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kierski | first1 = Werner | title = Men and the fear of the feminine | journal = Self &amp; Society | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 27&amp;ndash;33 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/03060497.2007.11083943 | date = March–April 2007 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/03060497.2007.11083943 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the various sources, the male fear of the feminine is connected to influences from their mothers and to cultural norms that prescribe how men must behave in order to feel accepted as men.

When men experience vulnerable feelings and other feelings that are associated with women, men can become frightened. According to Kierski (2007), the fear of the feminine then acts in two ways: a) Like an internal monitor to ensure that men stay within the boundaries of what is regarded as masculine, i.e. being action orientated, self-reliant, guarded, and seemingly independent; b) if a man fails to experience this and feels out of control, vulnerable or dependent, the fear of the feminine can act like a defense, leading to splitting off, [[Psychological repression|repressing]], or projecting those feelings.&lt;ref name="Kierski_2007" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Kierski's research claimed that men do acknowledge that male fear of the feminine can have a strong influence on both hetero- and homosexual men. The research has also indicated that there appears to be a link between fear of the feminine and men's negative views about counseling and [[psychotherapy]]. In addition, this research has identified four possible groups of experiences that lead to male fear of the feminine, which relate to internal and external triggers. These are: Experiencing vulnerability and uncertainty; women who are strong and competent; women who are angry or aggressive; women who are like their mothers.&lt;ref name="Kierski_2007" /&gt;

Constructions of race and sexuality in the western world caused particular expressions of homophobic racism and sexual violence. Defying traditional gender expectations became unacceptable and spectacles are labeled as “other” for disregarding [gender] norms.

Issues of [[homophobia]] and [[gay bashing]] are of relevance to the study of masculine psychology. Every year, men (such as [[Matthew Shepard]]) die as a result of [[gay bashing]]. The victims of gay bashing attacks are most often [[homosexual]] males, or those who display what are commonly perceived as effeminate behaviors or [[mannerism]]s which are, when seen in males, often associated with homosexuality. Self-identified [[heterosexual]] males are usually the perpetrators of gay bashing attacks.

Sigmund Freud presented the thesis that everyone is at some level [[bisexual]], and [[Alfred Kinsey]] research results claimed that as many as 37% of American males had engaged in homosexual activity. French-Canadian psychologist Guy Corneau says that despite Kinsey's research results, attitudes toward homosexuality have remained hostile.

The author says it is puzzling that we live in what he considers a male-dominated society, and yet very little work has been done to understand the [[archetypal]] basis of masculinity. He suggests that this may be due to a societal assumption of male superiority, founded on the belief that one should not question that which is deemed to be right and superior.

The '''National Institute of Statistics and Census''' of [[Costa Rica]] (''Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos de Costa Rica'', or ''INEC'', in Spanish) is the governmental institution entrusted with the running of [[census]]es and official [[statistical survey|surveys]] in the country. Its main office is located in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]].

== History ==
INEC was first called ''Oficina Central de Estadística'' about its foundation in 1861. Later, in 1951, it was called ''Dirección General de Estadística y Censos'', until 1998, when INEC was its legal name. INEC ran its first census in 1864, and the latest was the [[Costa Rica 2011 Census|10th population and the 6th dwellings census]], held in June 2011.

{{Youth rights sidebar}}

The '''newsboys' strike of 1899''' was a U.S. [[youth activism|youth-led campaign]] to force change in the way that [[Joseph Pulitzer]] and [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s newspapers compensated their [[child labor]] force of [[newspaper hawker]]s. The strikers demonstrated across the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] for several days, effectively bringing traffic to a standstill,&lt;ref&gt;Haw, R. (2005) ''The Brooklyn Bridge: A Cultural History.'' Rutgers University Press. p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; along with the news distribution for many [[New England]] cities. The [[Strike action|strike]] lasted two weeks, causing Pulitzer's ''[[New York World]]'' to decrease its circulation from 360,000 papers sold per day to 125,000.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, David. (1999) "Ch. 3: Youse an' yer noble scrap: On strike with the Newsboy Legion in 1899." in ''Big Town, Big Time.'' New York: New York Daily News. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the price of papers was not lowered, the strike was successful in forcing the World and Journal to offer full buy-backs to their sellers, thus increasing the amount of money that newsies received for their work.&lt;ref&gt;Mott, F.L. (2000) ''American Journalism''. New York: Routledge. p. 598.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

At the turn of the century, newsboys were essential to newspaper distribution. While morning editions of the paper were often delivered directly to subscribers, the afternoon editions relied almost exclusively on newsboys to sell.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children of the City: At Work and at Play|last=Nasaw|first=David|publisher=Anchor Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=Garden City, New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the newsboys came from poor immigrant families and sold papers in the afternoons and evenings, after their school finished. They bought papers at 50¢ per hundred, and sold them at 1¢ each for a profit of half a cent per paper.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There were newsboy strikes several years before the events of 1899, including those in [[Newsboys' strike of 1884|1884]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E7D6163AEF33A25757C1A9669D94659FD7CF&amp;scp=11&amp;sq=Newsboys+Strike&amp;st=p "Newsboys strike"], ''New York Times.''

July 21, 1899&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
In 1898, with the [[Spanish–American War]] increasing newspaper sales, several publishers raised the cost of a newsboy bundle of 100 newspapers from 50¢ to 60¢,&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1889/08/13/100966784.pdf "Newsboys on Strike"], ''New York''. August 13, 1889&lt;/ref&gt; a price increase that at the time was offset by the increased sales. After the war, many papers reduced the cost back to previous levels, with the notable exceptions of ''[[The Evening World]]'' and the ''[[New York Evening Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/new-york-times/july-21-1899/ "Newsboys Go On Strike"], ''New York Times''. July 21, 1899&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strike==
[[File:Child Labor in United States 1910 working night shift.jpg|thumb|left|Newsies often worked late, past midnight. Above, a newsboy working in New York (1910).]]

=== Early Days ===
On July 18, 1899, a group of newsboys in [[Long Island City]] turned over a distribution wagon for the ''New York Journal'' and declared a strike against the papers of [[Joseph Pulitzer]], publisher of the ''World'', and [[William Randolph Hearst]], publisher of the ''Journal'' until prices were rolled back to 50¢ per hundred.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The newsboys of [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]] were quick to follow the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/brooklyn-eagle/july-20-1899/|title=July 20, 1899: “Newsboys Start A Strike.”|date=2016-01-01|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newsboys' methods were violent in the early days of the strike. Any man or boy found to be selling the two boycotted papers would be mobbed by a group of strikers, beaten, and his papers destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/sun/july-24-1899a/ "Plan to Down Newsboys"], ''The Sun''. 24 July 1899&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper owners paid grown men to sell their papers, offering them police protection, but the strikers often found ways to distract the officers so they could get at the "scabs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/sun/july-23-1899/|title=July 23, 1899: “Newsboys’ Strike Swells”|date=2013-02-14|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women and girls fared a little better because, as union leader Kid Blink put it, "A feller can't soak a lady."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/sun/july-23-1899/|title=July 23, 1899: “Newsboys’ Strike Swells”|date=2013-02-14|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The newsboys also distributed flyers and hung signs around the city encouraging people to help them in their cause by not buying the ''World'' and ''Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/evening-telegram/july-22-1899/|title=July 22, 1899: “Boy Strikers Sweep the City”|date=2015-03-31|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rally at Irving Hall ===
On July 24, 1899, the newsboys held a city-wide rally at [[Irving Place Theatre|Irving Hall]] sponsored by state senator [[Timothy Sullivan|Timothy D. Sullivan]]. An estimated five thousand boys from Manhattan attended the rally, along with two thousand boys from Brooklyn and several hundred from other areas of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/new-york-herald/july-25-1899/|title=July 25, 1899: “Newsboys Wage A Merry War”|date=2013-08-30|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many local business men and politicians addressed the crowd, including lawyer Leonard A. Suitkin, Frank B. Wood, and ex-Assemblyman Phil Wissig. When the adults had finished speaking, union president David Simmons read a list of resolutions saying that the strike was to stand until the papers reduced their prices, and also calling on the newsboys to adopt non-violent methods of resistance.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/sun/july-25-1899a/|title=July 25, 1899: “Great Meet of Newsboys”|date=2013-02-20|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other speeches were made by "Warhorse" Brennan, Jack Tietjen, "Bob the Indian", [https://newsboys-of-1899.tumblr.com/post/167557956970/kid-blinks-speech-at-the-rally union leader "Kid Blink,"] "Crazy" Arborn, Annie Kelly, and [https://newsboys-of-1899.tumblr.com/post/167593280083/race-track-higgins-speech-at-the-rally Brooklyn leader "Racetrack" Higgins]. The night ended with a song sung by "Hungry Joe" Kernan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/sun/july-25-1899a/|title=July 25, 1899: “Great Meet of Newsboys”|date=2013-02-20|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A floral horseshoe was offered to Kid Blink as a reward for giving the best speech of the evening.

=== After the Rally ===
In the days following the rally, the newsboys' tactics changed to be non-violent. Even though they were no longer beating people who sold the ''World'' and ''Journal'', the strike was still effective since by then the public was on their side and chose not to buy them even if they were for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/evening-telegram/july-25-1899/|title=July 25, 1899: “Newsboy Strike Gains Ground”|date=2015-03-31|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 1899 the newsboys planned a parade where as many as 6,000 boys would march accompanied by a band and fireworks, but this parade never happened due to issues with obtaining a permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/evening-telegram/july-26-1899/|title=July 26, 1899: “Newsboys Ready to Show Strength”|date=2015-03-31|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kid Blink Disgraced ===
On July 26, 1899, rumors spread among the newsboys that strike leaders Kid Blink and David Simmons had betrayed the strike and agreed to sell the boycotted papers in exchange for a bribe from the newspaper executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/new-york-times/july-27-1899/|title=July 27,1899: “Newsboys Are Weakening”|date=2013-02-11|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both boys denied the charges, but some sources note that Kid Blink wore clothes a bit nicer than usual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/evening-telegram/july-28-1899/|title=July 28, 1899: “Newsboys See Victory Ahead”|date=2015-03-31|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these suspicions, Kid Blink and David Simmons resigned from their leadership positions, Simmons changing from union president to treasurer, and Kid Blink becoming a walking delegate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/new-york-tribune/july-30-1899-supplement/|title=July 30, 1899: “New-York Newsboys,” Illustrated Supplement|date=2013-02-12|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That night, Kid Blink was chased through the streets by a group of boys angry about the rumors that he had abandoned the strike. A police officer, seeing the group of running boys, grabbed Kid Blink, assuming he was leading them, and arrested him for disorderly conduct. Kid Blink was given a fine and let go while a group of newsboys outside the court jeered at him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/evening-telegram/july-28-1899/|title=July 28, 1899: “Newsboys See Victory Ahead”|date=2015-03-31|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The End of the Strike ===
After the rumors of Kid Blink and David Simmons' desertion of the strike, combined with their failure to obtain a parade permit, the newsboys' faith in centralized leadership was diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/evening-telegram/july-28-1899/|title=July 28, 1899: “Newsboys See Victory Ahead”|date=2015-03-31|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other newsboys stepped up to lead the strikers,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; but none of them had the same level of power and influence as Kid Blink once had.

On August 1, 1899, the ''World'' and ''Journal'' offered the newsboys a compromise: the price of a hundred papers would remain at 60¢, but they would buy back any unsold papers. This meant that boys who had trouble selling all their papers would not be forced to sell late into the night to avoid taking a loss for the day. The newsboys accepted this compromise, ending the strike and disbanding the union on August 2, 1899.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/new-york-tribune/aug-2-1899/ "Newsboys' Boycott Over"], ''New York Tribune''. 2 August 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strike Leaders ==
The leadership of the newsboy strike was less centralized than most unions, with boys in each neighborhood feeling more loyalty to the other kids in their area than to the centralized leadership.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That said, some kids were more influential than others, organizing rallies, acting as spokespeople for the strike, and being interviewed by papers such as the ''[[New-York Tribune|New York Tribune]]'', ''[[The New York Sun|New York Sun]]'' or ''[[New York Herald]]''. The papers often quoted the strikers with their New York accents depicted as an [[eye dialect]], using such sayings as "Me nobul men is all loyal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/new-york-tribune/july-23-1899/|title=July 23, 1899: “Newsboys’ Word Stands”|date=2013-02-11|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Louis "Kid Blink" Baletti ===
The face of the strike was Louis "Kid Blink" Baletti. Kid Blink was 18 during the strike,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/137547362/louis-balletti|title=Louis “Kid Wink” Balletti (1883-1913) - Find A...|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is described by papers at the time as an "undersized boy"&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/new-york-times/july-25-1899/|title=July 25, 1899: “Newsboys Act and Talk”|date=2013-02-11|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; with red hair and an eye patch over his left eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/sun/july-23-1899/|title=July 23, 1899: “Newsboys’ Strike Swells”|date=2013-02-14|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also went by the nicknames "Red Blink",&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; "Muggsy McGee"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/evening-telegram/july-20-1899/|title=July 20, 1899: “Newsboys Strike Against Two Papers”|date=2015-03-01|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Blind Diamond."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/new-york-tribune/july-24-1899/|title=July 24, 1899: “A Newsboys’ Meeting”|date=2013-02-11|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kid Blink was a charismatic leader. Several newspapers recorded speeches he gave at rallies, one of which reads in part "Friens and feller workers. This is a time which tries de hearts of men. Dis is de time when we'se got to stick together like glue....

Kid Blink was accused of betraying the strike and accepting a bribe to sell the boycotted papers, and though some sources claim he was acquitted of these charges he still stepped down from his leadership position after being accused.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/new-york-tribune/july-27-1899a/|title=July 27, 1899: “Tried for High Treason”|date=2013-02-27|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was arrested during the strike, Kid Blink told the police his name was Louis Ballat,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/sun/july-28-1899a/|title=July 28, 1899: “Newsboys Get New Leaders”|date=2013-04-04|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was likely lying or misheard because his real name appears to have been Louis Baletti.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsieshistory.tumblr.com/post/91454605563/some-things-we-know-about-the-real-kid-blink-part|title=Some things we know about the real Kid Blink, part one.|website=Newsies Historical Research|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the strike, Kid Blink got a job as a cart driver and later as a saloon keeper. He may have also worked as the right-hand man to New York mobster Chuck Connors. He died in July of 1913 at the age of 32 of tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newsboys-of-1899.tumblr.com/post/179689207126/a-timeline-of-kid-blinks-life|title=A Timeline of Kid Blink’s Life|website=Newsies of 1899|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== David Simmons ===
David Simmons was president of the newsboy union at the beginning of the strike, and treasurer in the second half after he was accused of betraying the strike and was forced to step back from his leadership role.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He was twenty-one at the time of the strike, and had been selling newspapers since the age of eight. He was also a well-known amateur prize fighter at the local athletic clubs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Simmons read a list of resolutions at the rally at Irving Hall, which the crowd reportedly found quite boring.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Ed "Racetrack" Higgins ===
Ed "Racetrack" Higgins &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/sun/july-31-1899/|title=July 31: “Striking Newsboys Elect Officers”date=2015-03-31|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the leader of the Brooklyn union, and was elected vice-president of the general union after Kid Blink and David Simmons stepped back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/evening-telegram/july-31-1899/|title=July 31, 1899: “Union to Enforce Newsboys’ Strike”|date=2015-03-31|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higgins was a fixture at the [[Sheepshead Bay Race Track]], and referenced horses in many quotes at the time of the strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newsboys-of-1899.tumblr.com/post/168014495741/race-track-higgins-and-his-wonderfully|title=“Race Track” Higgins and his wonderfully appropriate name|website=Newsboys of 1899|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higgins was a charismatic speaker, several papers mentioning his use of humour in his speeches to the striking newsboys. ''Brooklyn Life'' referred to him as "a born leader of boys, and he may yet be of men."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/2015/07/29/the-looker-on-racetrack-higgins/|title=“The Looker-On” Observing Racetrack Higgins|date=2015-07-29|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; His speech at the rally went off so well that the ''New York Times'' said that “If the newsboys present could have had a vote last night, “Race Track Higgins” could have had any office in their gift.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/new-york-times/july-25-1899/|title=July 25, 1899: “Newsboys Act and Talk”|date=2013-02-11|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morris Cohen ===
Morris Cohen was union president after Kid Blink and David Simmons stepped down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/evening-telegram/july-27-1899/|title=July 27, 1899: “Salvation Lassies Wouldn’t Sell Them”|date=2015-03-31|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very little is known about him, but a July 20 memo from Joseph Pulitzer's business manager Don Seitz names Cohen as the boy who started the strike in New York City.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Henry "Major Butts" Butler ===
Henry "Major Butts" Butler was leader of the Upper Manhattan union after Kid Blink stepped down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/new-york-herald/july-30-1899/|title=July 30, 1899: “Striking Newsboys Stand Firm”|date=2014-02-15|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested on July 31, 1899 on a charge of blackmail after telling executives at the “New York World” that he would not break the strike for less than $600 ($600 in 1900, is roughly equivalent to $16,000 in 2018 with added inflation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/sun/aug-1-1899/|title=August 1, 1899: “‘World’ Jails Newsboys”|date=2013-04-04|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annie Kelly ===
Annie Kelly was one of the few newswomen loyal to the strike, a fact that made her very popular with the striking newsboys, who saw her as "almost a patron saint."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityhallpark1899.com/newspaper-articles/new-york-tribune/july-25-1899d/|title=July 25, 1899:  “Park Row Capulets and Monatgues”|date=2013-02-12|work=City Hall Park 1899|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the only woman to speak at the rally at Irving Hall, after being pulled on stage by a crowd of cheering newsboys, where she told them “All I can say, boys, is to stick together and we’ll win. That’s all I’ve got to say to you.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Legacy==
The newsboys' strike of 1899 has been credited with inspiring later strikes, including the [[Butte, Montana]], Newsboys Strike of 1914,&lt;ref&gt;Peavy, L. and Smith, U. (1999) ''Frontier Children.'' University of Oklahoma Press. p.112.&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1920s strike in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;Reinier, J.S., Ferguson, P. and West, E. (2001) ''Boyhood in America: An encyclopedia.'' ABC-Clio Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some decades later, the introduction of urban [[Child protection|child-welfare]] practices led to improvements in the newsboys' quality of life.

==Cultural representations==
The newsboys were fictionalized in 1942 by [[DC Comics]] as the [[Newsboy Legion]], first appearing in Issue number 7 of ''[[Star Spangled Comics]]'' and continuing therein through issue 64, as well as also continuing in various forms to modern-day comics.

The events of the 1899 strike later inspired the 1992 Disney film ''[[Newsies]]'', including a character named Kid Blink (who wears an eye patch), but in this version of the story the leader of the strike was named Jack Kelly. A [[musical theatre]] adaptation of the film, also called ''[[Newsies (musical)|Newsies]]'', debuted in 2011 and played on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] from 2012 to 2014, starring [[Jeremy Jordan (actor)|Jeremy Jordan]] as Jack Kelly, and on tour from 2014-2016. A live filmed version of the stage production with cast members from both the Broadway and Tour productions, was digitally released on May 23, 2017.

The newsboy strike is described in detail in the 2003 non-fiction book, ''[[Kids on Strike!]]''

'''Opportunity structures''', in [[sociology]] and related social science disciplines, are exogenous factors which limit or empower collective actors (social movements). In explaining the evolution of social movements, the [[structuralism (sociology)|structuralist]] approach emphasizes that factors external to the movements themselves, such as the level and type of state repression, or the group's access to political institutions, shape the development of the movement; such factors are called opportunity structures.

==Components==
Doug McAdam summarizes at least four key dynamic components of the political opportunity structure: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. the relative openness or closure of the institutionalized political system; 

2. the stability or instability of the broad set of elite alignments that typically undergird a polity; 

3. the presence or absence of elite allies; 

4. and the state's capacity and propensity for repression.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas McAdam, Conceptal origins, current problems, future directions, in: Douglas McAdam, John D. McCarthy, Mayer Y. Zald (ed.), Comparative perspectives on social movements. Political opportunities, mobilizing structures, and cultural framings (Cambridge studies in comparative politics), Cambridge 1999, pp. 23–40, here: p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

==Collective action==
Political opportunity structures can constrain or expand the field of [[collective action]] in four ways: 
#they expand the group's own opportunities; 
#they expand opportunities for others; 
#create opportunities for opponents 
#and create opportunities for elites

'''Raymond "Ray" Paternoster''' (February 29, 1952 – March 5, 2017) was an American criminologist who taught at the [[University of Maryland]] from 1982 until his death in 2017, spending some of this time as a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://criminology.fsu.edu/news/college-mourns-passing-of-alumnus-dr-raymond-paternoster/ |title=College Mourns Passing of Alumnus Dr. Raymond Paternoster |website=Florida State University College of Criminology and Criminal Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Paternoster received his [[bachelor's degree]] from the [[University of Delaware]] in 1973, his masters' from [[Southern Illinois University]] in 1975, and his Ph.D. from [[Florida State University]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ccjs.umd.edu/sites/ccjs.umd.edu/files/cv/PaternosterVita_0.pdf |title=Raymond Paternoster CV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Paternoster joined the faculty of the [[University of South Carolina]] as an assistant professor in 1978. He joined the faculty of the University of Maryland in 1982, and became a full professor there in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dbknews.com/2017/03/07/umd-professor-ray-paternoster/ |title="One of the smartest people I ever knew": UMD mourns death of professor Ray Paternoster |last=Campisi |first=Jessie |date=2017-03-06 |website=[[The Diamondback]] |access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Paternoster was known for his research on racial disparities in the application of [[capital punishment in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-te.md.death06jun06-story.html |title=Court to hear bias challenge against Md. death penalty |last=Goldberg |first=Lisa |website=Baltimore Sun |publication-date=6 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/08/us/death-penalty-found-more-likely-if-victim-is-white.html |title=Death Penalty Found More Likely if Victim Is White |last=Liptak |first=Adam |website=The New York Times |publication-date=8 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/13/houston-texas-death-row-black-inmates |title=Research exposes racial discrimination in America's death penalty capital |last=Pilkington |first=Ed |website=The Guardian |publication-date=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-14/news/mn-612_1_black-male |title= 'We Seem Intent . . . on Putting Our Own Apartheid Into Place' |last=Inman |first=William |website=Los Angeles Times |publication-date=14 August 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research includes a study of racial bias in [[Maryland]]'s death penalty commissioned by the state's then-governor, [[Parris N. Glendening]]. Paternoster then spent 2 and a half years analyzing data before releasing the study in 2003. The study reported that black defendants who killed whites were much more likely to be sentenced to death than defendants who killed blacks, whether the defendants were black or white.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-md.penalty08jan08-story.html |title=Racial factor found in Md. capital cases |last=Koenig |first=Sarah |website=Baltimore Sun |publication-date=8 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 dissent, [[Maryland Court of Appeals]] Chief Judge [[Robert M. Bell]] cited Paternoster's research on this topic as evidence that capital punishment in Maryland was biased against blacks. In his dissent in a case brought by death row inmate [[Vernon Evans, Jr.]], Bell wrote, "The Paternoster study provides substantial evidence that the Baltimore County State's Attorney's Office singled out black defendants from similarly situated white defendants when choosing against whom to seek the death penalty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16295971/ns/politics/t/maryland-court-halts-executions/#.WOO48IgrLb0 |title=Maryland court halts executions |last=Associated Press |website=NBC News |publication-date=20 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10399">The '''Schweizeische Ausstellung für Frauenarbeit''' ('''SAFFA''', English: Swiss Exhibition for Women's Work) was an exhibition that took place in [[Bern]] in 1928 and in [[Zürich]] in 1958. SAFFA was organized by the [[Bund Schweizerischer Frauenvereine]] (BFS, the Federation of Swiss Women's Associations), the Swiss Catholic Women's League (SKF), and 28 other Swiss women's associations, to highlight the precarious situation of working women in the postwar years.

In the '"Viererfeld" area (today Länggasse-Felsenau) in Bern, the first Saffa was held from 26 August until 30 September 1928.

Focus of the exhibition were the services of women in family, working life, science and art; the representation of women's work and their importance for the Swiss economy and society. Saffa also promoted the female self-confidence and campaigned –for the so far not related – political rights to the Swiss women and the right to a gainful employment, as well as for their recognition as Swiss citizens with all political rights,&lt;ref name="hds-saffa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D17336.php|title=Saffa|publisher=HDS|author=Yvonne Voegeli|language=German|date=2011-12-09|accessdate=2014-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless the Women's suffrage in Switzerland was realized in the last cantons in 1990.

From 17 July until 15 September 1958, the BSF led the second Saffa with over a hundred national and cantonal women's organisations on the ''[[Landiwiese]]'' in Zürich-[[Wollishofen]]. Before, the ''[[Saffa-Insel]]'', an artificial island was poured, being still a popular meeting place that is also used as lido in the summer and for events. As chief architect of the exhibition, which stood under the motto "Life circle of women in family, occupation, and country", acted Annemarie Hubacher-Constam.&lt;ref name="hds-"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D27366.php|title=Hubacher [-Constam], Annemarie|publisher=HDS|author=Dagmar Böcker|language=German|date=2012-08-27|accessdate=2014-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAFFA presented the women, who were wanted in the booming economy as consumers and workers, possibilities in the areas of education, employment, shopping and leisure. In accordance with the needs of economic and sociopolitical needs, SAFFA promoted the then three-phase model as an 'ideal female curriculum': employment prior to the marriage, motherhood, and return to the labour market. In addition, the women had to absorb negative impacts of the rapidly changing world, nevertheless, by spreading harmony inside and outside of their families. The men should be made aware of 'women services' in the service of the general public on the indispensability and so motivated to fix the social discrimination against women. With the profits from the two exhibitions, solidarity works were established for women.&lt;ref name="hds-saffa"/&gt;

Having 1.9 million visitors, the exhibition was organized exclusively and also designed by women, including [[ETH Zurich]] alumnae [[Berta Rahm]] and Claire Rufer-Eckmann.&lt;ref name="IAWA_V11"&gt;Jakob, Evelyne Lang. "The Life and Work of Berta Rahm, 1910 - 1998," &lt;i&gt;IAWA Newsletter&lt;/i&gt;, Fall 1999, V. 11, p. 1. {{cite web|url=http://spec.lib.vt.edu/IAWA/news/news11.pdf|title=Berta Rahm and Clair Rufer|accessdate=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frauennet2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Berta Rahm|url=http://www.frauennet.ch/index.php/frauen-geschichten/8-berta-rahm|website=Frauennet|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An innovation and particularly startling were the [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotundas]], which were planned as manifestation of the solidarity of women.  Topics such as "my home – my world", "needle and thread" and "in the realm of the kitchen" attracted the then housewives. The Saffa 1958 was marked by the upcoming vote to women's suffrage, thus the promoters did not practice an overly combative appearance and even created a "men paradise" (''Männerparadies'') department.&lt;ref name="stiftung-frauenarbeit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stiftung-frauenarbeit.ch/index.php/de/stiftung/geschichte/ausstellungen|title=Die Ausstellungen|publisher=stiftung-frauenarbeit.ch|author=|language=|date=|accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion of the ''Saffatheater'' [[Jörg Schneider]] played in the cabaret comedy ''Lysistrata''.&lt;ref name="zol-20150822"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zol.ch/bezirk-hinwil/wetzikon/joerg-schneider-ist-tot/story/13778801|title=Jörg Schneider ist tot|publisher=[[Zürcher Oberländer]]|author=|language=German|date=2015-08-22|accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For that time, the women excelled with innovative ideas, among the Saffa Women's Orchestra at the opening concert, of course, exclusively from women musicians, and directed by the first women conductor who graduated in Switzerland, [[Hedi Salquin]], who conducted the concerto for orchestra ''Intrada'' by [[Fernande Peyrot]] (1888–1978) in the [[Wasserkirche]] auditorium.&lt;ref name="stiftung-frauenarbeit"/&gt;

The exhibition was a great success and generated a substantial financial surplus that was used for solidarity associations for women. The Saffa island was dedicated to women, and is part of the water lot owned by the canton of Zürich.&lt;ref name="frauennet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frauennet.ch/index.php/frauen-bewegung/20-saffa-schweizerische-ausstellung-fuer-frauenarbeit|title=Die SAFFA – Schweizerische Ausstellung für Frauenarbeit|publisher=frauennet.ch|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Saffa 2020 ==
The Swiss Federal Council signed the optional protocol as an addition to the Women Convention for the legal and formal recognition of the full human rights of women in Switzerland in February 2007. The Internet platform ''frauennet.ch'' proposed the decision to organise a third SAFFA on the occasion of their women picnic brunches on the Swiss national holiday on the ''Saffa-Island'' in Zürich. For financial reasons, the project could not be started for the time being. [[Alliance F]], as before better known as [[Bund Schweizerischer Frauenvereine]] (BFS), prepares a third Saffa, founded the "2020" association for this purpose, and initiated the project "2020 – der weibliche blick auf die zukunft" (literally: 2020 – the female looks to the future). The project seeks to capture ideas and visions for the future of our society from the perspective of women and in an appropriate manner of the public present. A first web presentation was 2013 and started the realization phase to SAFFA 2020.

The project ''2020 – der weibliche blick auf die zukunft'' is under the patronage of the three federal councillors (''Bundesrat'') [[Doris Leuthard]], [[Simonetta Sommaruga]] and [[Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf]] as well as by the former councillor (''aBR'') [[Micheline Calmy-Rey]].&lt;ref name="2020-patronat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2020.ch/site/?page_id=13=|title=Patronat|publisher=2020.ch|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2014-12-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223701/http://www.2020.ch/site/?page_id=13%3D|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sri Aurobindo}}
'''Satprem''' (30 October 1923 – 9 April 2007) was a French author and a disciple of [[Mirra Alfassa]].

==Early life==

Satprem was born Bernard Enginger in [[Paris]] and had a seafaring childhood and youth in [[Brittany]].

During World War II he was a member of the [[French Resistance]] (in the "[[Turma-Vengeance]]" network). He was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] in late 1943 and spent one and a half years in German [[concentration camp]]s. Scarred by the experience, after the war he became interested in the [[existentialism]] of [[André Gide]] and [[André Malraux]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges van Vrekham, ''Beyond the Human Species'' p.370&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
He travelled to [[Egypt]] and then [[India]], where he worked briefly as a [[civil servant]] in the French colonial administration of [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]], on the [[Bay of Bengal]].  There he discovered [[Sri Aurobindo]] and [[Mira Alfassa|The Mother]] and their "new evolution". He resigned from the civil service, and went in search of adventure in [[French Guiana]], where he spent a year in the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] (the setting for his first novel ''L'Orpailleur'' (''The Gold Washer''), with his copy of Sri Aurobindo's ''[[The Life Divine]]'', then [[Brazil]], and after that [[Africa]].

In 1953, aged 30, he returned to India and [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] to put himself at the service of The Mother and settle in the [[Ashram]]. He taught a little at the Ashram school, and was in charge of the French copy for the quarterly ''Bulletin of the Department of Physical Education'' which was The Mother's publication, and is still printed in English and French.  During this time he met his companion [[Sujata Nahar]].

Enginger then travelled once more throughout the [[Congo (area)|Congo]], Brasília, [[Afghanistan]], the Himalayas, [[New Zealand]], and sailed around the world, before once again returning.

On 3 March 1957, The Mother gave him the name Satprem ("the one who loves truly").&lt;ref&gt;''Agenda'' vol.1, p.48 n.2, and p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

Satprem remained restless and dissatisfied for some years, torn between his devotion to The Mother along with Sri Aurobindo's teachings, and his wanderlust, and in 1959 he again left the ashram.  He became the disciple of a [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] lama, a priest of temple at [[Rameswaram]]. Then as the disciple of another Yogi he spent six months  wandering around India as a mendicant [[sanyasi]] practicing Tantra, which formed the basis of his second novel, ''Par le Corps de la Terre, ou le Sanyassin'' (''By the Body of the Earth or, The Sanyasi'').&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond the Human Species'' p.371&lt;/ref&gt;

After this he returned again (as he put it, "the bird flew back once more" &lt;ref&gt;''[[Mother's Agenda]]'' vol.1 p.327&lt;/ref&gt;), to the Pondicherry Ashram and the Mother, who started inviting him from time to time to her room, originally for work in connection with the Bulletin.  As their relationship developed, he asked more questions, and eventually decided to record their conversations, taking a tape-recorder to her room. The result of this collaboration was the 13-volume ''The Agenda'', the first of which covers 1951 to 1960 (and contains Satprem's letters to The Mother during his wandering days), and ends with the year 1973. 90% of the volumes consists of the Mother's explanation of her inner and outer experiences, with Satprem's comments, questions for her, etc. A great deal of the conversation involved Mother's discussions of how she was trying to make her physical body open to what she believed was a spiritual force, so illness and death could be overcome, not only for herself, but for humanity.

Also, under The Mother's guidance he wrote ''Sri Aurobindo, ou l'Aventure de la Conscience'' (''Sri Aurobindo, or the Adventure of Consciousness''), which became the most popular introductory book to Sri Aurobindo and The Mother (published 1964). In 1972 and 1973 he also wrote under the Mother's guidance the essay ''La Genèse du Surhomme'' (''On the Way to Supermanhood''), which she regarded very highly.  This was published in 1974.

==Death of the Mother==
Satprem relates that on 19 May 1973, six months before The Mother's death he was barred admission to her room,&lt;ref&gt;Satprem Mind of the Cells'', 1982 p.200, and ''Agenda'' vol.13&lt;/ref&gt; the beginning of a serious falling out between the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram|Ashram]] leadership and himself.  Moreover, Satprem and his followers believe there is evidence in the recorded audiotapes that the Mother did not actually die but rather entered a "cataleptic trance" or state of suspended animation in which there would not even be a detectable heartbeat.&lt;ref&gt;''Mind of the Cells'' pp.198-202&lt;/ref&gt; Satprem recorded a famous conversation between the Mother and Pranab which made Satprem conclude that several Ashram sadhaks did not want the Mother to continue her life. However, Pranab has argued that on the contrary he was very much concerned about the Mother's health and that he had received precise instructions from her as to what to do when she appeared to have left her body.&lt;ref&gt;Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya, ''I Remember'', Sri Aurobindo Bhavan, Calcutta 1993, pp.132-133&lt;/ref&gt; These instructions, he says, were exactly followed before she was buried in the second chamber of Sri Aurobindo's Samadhi in the Ashram courtyard under the Service tree, which she herself got prepared after Sri Aurobindo's departure in December 1950.

Georges Van Vrekhem disagrees with Satprem's claim that the Mother's work was cut short in those last six months, and argues instead that she did indeed attain a [[Supermind (Integral thought)|Supramental body]] and what remained was the residue, like the empty cocoon of a caterpillar after it has become a butterfly &lt;ref&gt;Van Vrekhem, ''Beyond the Human Species'' pp.496ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and publishing==
After the Mother's death, all of Satprem's correspondence from 1962 to 1973 with the Mother was confiscated, and he fled with the tapes of the Agenda to [[Auroville]], where, at the age of 50, he edited the 13 volumes of the Agenda, while at the same time wrote the trilogy ''Mère'' (''Mother'') - ''Le Matérialisme Divin'' (''The Divine Materialism''), ''L'Espèce Nouvelle'' (''The New Species''), ''La Mutation de la Mort'' (''The Mutation of Death'') - both a biography of the Mother and his own analyses and commentary on the Agenda material.

Satprem became a rallying point for the community shocked by the attitude the ashram leaders had taken.&lt;ref&gt;Savitra, "When Intensity overtakes Integrality; a personal look at the man and the myth called Satprem", ''NexUS, the newsletter for the USA Centres of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother'' Winter 1994-95, pp.27-30&lt;/ref&gt; His one-man revolt against the Ashram leadership began in 1974, and involved two issues.  One was his wish to publish, unexpurgated, the entire transcript of his talks with the Mother.  He saw the resistance of the ashram trustees and elders in this regard as symptomatic of the way they had directed the ashram from 1962 onwards.  The other was his claim that under the current leadership the Yoga had become institutionalised and dogmatic, like the yogas of the past.  For their part, the elders wished to publish the transcripts but only in edited form.  And where Satprem saw conservatism and dogmatism, they saw a loyal commitment to their gurus to uphold the original truth of their teachings&lt;ref&gt;David J. Lorenzo, ''Tradition and the Rhetoric of Right'' p.223-5&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Satprem was looked to by the French-speaking Aurovillians as the successor and inheritor of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother's work, and a number of radicals were drawn to him because of his revolt against the Ashram elders &lt;ref&gt;''Tradition and the Rhetoric of Right'' p.223&lt;/ref&gt;

After numerous unsuccessful attempts to get the 13 volumes of the Agenda published by the Ashram, Auroville, and Sri Aurobindo Society presses, Satprem founded the ''Institut de Recherches Évolutives'' (Institute for Evolutionary Research) in Paris in July 1977 as a non-profit organisation to do so.".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Minor, ''The Religious, the Spiritual, and the Secular'' p.177 note 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, there was an allegation of an assassination attempt against him in August 1976, and in December 1977 (or 1978) the Ashram trustees "expelled" him for "anti-ashram activities" as he attempted to publish the ''Agenda'', and he became ''persona non grata'' in the Ashram.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Titlebaum]] (1985-1986) {{cite web |url=http://www.rtitlebaum.com/TheMother.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018031815/http://www.rtitlebaum.com/TheMother.html |archivedate=2007-10-18 |df= }} "Commentary" From The Journals, Boston, MA, 1985-1986&lt;/ref&gt;  Satprem and Sujata left [[Puducherry]] in 1978.

In 1980 Satprem wrote ''Le Mental des Cellules'' (''The Mind of the Cells''), a synopsis and introduction of the whole Agenda, focusing on the Mother's attempt to make the cells responsive to a supramental Force so their inner programming could be altered so not to automatically fall into illness, decay, and death, which was the ultimate physical result of Sri Aurobindo's Integral (Purna) Yoga.

In 1982 all 13 volumes of the ''Agenda'' were published in French, and Satprem felt he had completed all his external work.&lt;ref&gt;Luc Venet ''Life without Death'', p.113&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, he and Sujata decided to withdraw completely from public life to devote themselves exclusively to Sri Aurobindo's and Mother's work of the transformation of the cellular consciousness of the [[Human body|body]] and realisation of the new evolution, and the search for the "great passage" in the evolution beyond Man.  The 1985 book ''La Vie sans Mort'' (''Life without Death'') is a follow-up to ''Mind of the Cells'', co-written with Luc Venet,&lt;ref&gt;For an indepth description of Luc Venet's 20-year experience of closely collaborating with Satprem, see his essay on http://www.lesyeuxouverts.net&lt;/ref&gt; and provides a glimpse of Satprem in his post-Ashram life in this period.&lt;ref&gt;''Life without Death'', Part 3: Satprem (pp.107ff.)&lt;/ref&gt;

After seven years, Satprem emerged and began producing a steady stream of books on his experiences, Sri Aurobindo and the Mother's teachings, and the future evolution of Man.  In 1989, he wrote ''La Révolte de la Terre'' (''The Revolt of the Earth''), in which he describes his years "digging" in the body.  This was followed in 1992 by ''Evolution II'', where he asks "After Man, who? But the question is: After Man, how?"

In 1994 came his ''Lettres d'un Insoumis'' (''Letters of a Rebel''), two volumes of autobiographical correspondence.  In 1995 he wrote ''La Tragédie de la Terre - de Sophocle à Sri Aurobindo'' (''The Tragedy of the Earth - from Sophocles to Sri Aurobindo''), an urgent message for mankind to take action against the cycle of death.  This was followed in 1998 by ''La Clef des Contes'' (''The Key of Tales''), and in 1999 by "Néanderthal Regarde'' (''Neanderthal Looks On''), an essay on the betrayal of Man in India as in the West. In 2000 followed ''La Légende de l'Avenir'' (''The Legend of the Future'') and in 2002 ''Mémoires d'un Patagonien - Conte Préhistorique et Posthistorique'' (''Memoires of a Patagonian - Prehistoric and Posthistoric Tale'') and ''La Philosophie de l'Amour'' (''The Philosophy of Love''). In 2008, the IRE published his last book, ''L'Oiseau Doël'' (''The Doël Bird'').&lt;br /&gt;
In 1999, Satprem also started the publication of his ''Carnets d'un Apocalypse'' (''Notebooks of an Apocalypse'') (in French, seven volumes published to date, in English only vol.1, 1973-1978, dealing with the years and his experiences immediately after the passing of the Mother), which records his work in the depths of the body consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ire-miraditi.org/miraditi/sat-suj.html "Satprem and Sujata"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Satprem died on April 9, 2007 at the age of 83. His companion Sujata Nahar died after him on May 4, 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42885">'''Social emotional development''' represents a specific domain of [[child development]]. It is a gradual, integrative process through which children acquire the capacity to understand, experience, express, and manage emotions and to develop meaningful relationships with others.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, J., Onunaku, N., Clothier, S., &amp; Poppe, J. (2005). Helping young children succeed: Strategies to promote early childhood social and emotional development. In ''Research and Policy Report). Washington, DC: National Conference of State Legislatures''.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, social emotional development encompasses a large range of skills and constructs, including, but not limited to: self-awareness, joint attention, play, theory of mind (or understanding others' perspectives), self-esteem, emotion regulation, friendships, and identity development.  

Social emotional development sets a foundation for children to engage in other developmental tasks. For example, in order to complete a difficult school assignment, a child may need the ability to manage their sense of frustration and seek out help from a peer. To maintain a romantic relationship after a fight, a teen may need to be able to articulate their feelings and take the perspective of their partner to successfully resolve the conflict. However, it is also interrelated with and dependent on other developmental domains. For example, language delays or deficits have been associated with social-emotional disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benner|first=Gregory J.|last2=Nelson|first2=J. Ron|last3=Epstein|first3=Michael H.|date=2002|title=Language Skills of Children with EBD|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/106342660201000105|journal=Journal of Emotional and Behavioral Disorders|volume=10|issue=1|pages=43–56|doi=10.1177/106342660201000105|issn=1063-4266|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Many mental health disorders, including [[major depressive disorder]], [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety disorders]], [[borderline personality disorder]], [[Substance use disorder|substance use disorders]], and [[Eating disorder|eating disorders]], can be conceptualized through the lens of social emotional development, most prominently emotion regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berking|first=Matthias|last2=Wupperman|first2=Peggilee|date=2012|title=Emotion regulation and mental health|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/yco.0b013e3283503669|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|volume=25|issue=2|pages=128–134|doi=10.1097/yco.0b013e3283503669|issn=0951-7367|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the core symptoms of [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder]] reflect abnormalities in social emotional developmental areas, including joint attention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bruinsma|first=Yvonne|last2=Koegel|first2=Robert L.|last3=Koegel|first3=Lynn Kern|date=2004|title=Joint attention and children with autism: A review of the literature|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mrdd.20036|journal=Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews|volume=10|issue=3|pages=169–175|doi=10.1002/mrdd.20036|issn=1080-4013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and theory of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Baron-Cohen|first=Simon|title=Theory of mind and autism: A review|date=2000|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0074-7750(00)80010-5|work=Autism|pages=169–184|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780123662231|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Early childhood (birth to 3 years old) ==

=== Attachment ===
[[Attachment theory|Attachment]] refers to the strong bond that individuals develop with special people in our lives. Though we can have attachment relationships with significant others in adulthood, such as marital partners, most humans’ first and most influential attachment is with their primary caregiver(s) as infants. [[John Bowlby]] and [[Mary Ainsworth]] first delineated and tested attachment theory as an evolutionarily informed process in which the emotional ties to a caregiver are adaptive for survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bretherton|first=Inge|date=1992|title=The origins of attachment theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=28|issue=5|pages=759–775|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759|issn=0012-1649}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their research supported the presence of four stages of attachment formation:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Child Development, 9th Edition|last=Berk|first=Laura|publisher=Pearson|year=2013|isbn=978-0-205-14977-3|location=New Jersey|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waters|first=Everett|last2=Cummings|first2=E. Mark|date=2000|title=A Secure Base from Which to Explore Close Relationships|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-8624.00130|journal=Child Development|volume=71|issue=1|pages=164–172|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00130|issn=0009-3920|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Undiscriminating social responsiveness (0-3 months)''' – Instinctual infant signals, such as crying, gazing, gasping, help facilitate caregiver interactions with infants. Infants do not consistently discriminate with whom they signal or how they respond.    
# '''Preferential social responsiveness (3-6 months)''' – Infants now clearly respond differently to primary caregiver(s) than strangers. Infants have learned that this caregiver will consistently respond to their signals.
# '''Emergence of secure-base behavior (6-24 months)''' – Young children use their attachment figure as a “secure base” from which to explore the world and a “safe haven” to return to for reassurance or comfort. When the attachment figure is not available, children may exhibit separation anxiety.    
# '''Partnership (24 months and older''') – Children develop an internal working model about the availability and responsiveness of attachment figures that can impact their future behavior and relationships.    

[[File:Young mother smiling while holding her baby in Laos.jpg|thumb|An infant with her mother, a possible attachment figure]]
Early attachment is considered foundational to later social-emotional development, and is predictive of many outcomes, including internalizing problems, externalizing problems, social competence, self-esteem, cognitive development, and achievement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mary Ainsworth’s work using the [[Strange situation|Strange Situation]] method identified four types of attachment styles in young children:

# '''Secure attachment:''' Children in this category are willing to explore the room/toys independently when their caregiver is present. They may cry when separated, but seek out comfort and are easily soothed when their caregiver returns. This style is associated with sensitive, responsive care by the attachment figure. 
# '''Anxious/Avoidant attachment:''' Children in this category tend to be less responsive to separation from their caregiver, do not differentiate as clearly between caregivers and strangers, and are avoidant of caregivers upon return. This style is associated with overstimulating care or by consistently detached care.    
# '''Anxious/Ambivalent attachment:''' Children in this category may seek out closeness with caregiver and appear unwilling to explore. They show distress upon separation and may appear both mad (e.g., hitting, struggling) and clingy when the caregiver returns. These children are often harder to soothe. This style is associated with inconsistent responsiveness or maternal interference with exploration. 
# '''Disorganized attachment:''' Children in this category often do not show a predictable pattern of behavior, but may be non-responsive or demonstrate flat affect. This style is associated with unpredictable and/or frightening experiences with caregivers, and is more common in children who have experienced maltreatment.    

=== Emotional experiences ===

==== Emotional expression ====
[[File:Comunidad Pemon niño.JPG|thumb|Infant smiling]]
Beginning at birth, newborns have the capacity to signal generalized distress in response to unpleasant stimuli and bodily states, such as pain, hunger, body temperature, and stimulation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They may smile, seemingly involuntarily, when satiated, in their sleep, or in response to pleasant touch. Infants begin using a “social smile,” or a smile in response to a positive social interaction, at approximately 2-3 months of age, and laughter begins at 3-4 months.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Expressions of happiness become more intentional with age, with young children interrupting their actions to smile or express happiness to nearby adults at 8-10 months of age, and with markedly different kinds of smiles (e.g., grin, muted smile, mouth open smile) developing at 10-12 months of age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Between 18-24 months, children begin to acquire a sense of self. This gives rise to the onset of [[self-conscious emotions]] (i.e., shame, embarrassment, guilt, pride) around that same age, which are considered more complex in nature than the basic emotions of happiness, anger, fear, disgust. This is because they require that children have recognition of external standards, and evaluative capacities to determine whether the self meets that standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/123029833|title=The self-conscious emotions : theory and research|last=Price.|first=Tracy, Jessica L. Robins, Richard W. Tangney, June|date=2007|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=9781593854867|oclc=123029833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Emotion regulation ====
[[Emotional self-regulation|Emotion regulation]] can be defined by two components. The first, “emotions as regulating,” refers to changes that are elicited by activated emotions (e.g., a child’s sadness eliciting a change in parent response).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=Pamela M.|last2=Martin|first2=Sarah E.|last3=Dennis|first3=Tracy A.|date=2004|title=Emotion Regulation as a Scientific Construct: Methodological Challenges and Directions for Child Development Research|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00673.x|journal=Child Development|volume=75|issue=2|pages=317–333|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00673.x|issn=0009-3920|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second component is labeled “emotions as regulated,” which refers to the process through which the activated emotion is itself changed by deliberate actions taken by the self (e.g., self-soothing, distraction) or others (e.g., comfort).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Throughout infancy, children rely heavily on their caregivers for emotion regulation; this reliance is labeled [[co-regulation]]. Caregivers use strategies such as distraction and sensory input (e.g., rocking, stroking) to regulate infants’ emotions. Despite reliance on caregivers to change the intensity, duration, and frequency of emotions, infants are capable of engaging in self-regulation strategies as young as 4 months. At this age, infants intentionally avert their gaze from overstimulating stimuli.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 12 months, infants use their mobility in walking and crawling to intentionally approach or withdraw from stimuli.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Throughout toddlerhood, caregivers remain important for the emotional development and socialization of their children, through behaviors such as: labeling their child’s emotions, prompting thought about emotion (e.g., “why is the turtle sad?”), continuing to provide alternative activities/distractions, suggesting [[Coping (psychology)|coping strategies]], and modeling coping strategies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Caregivers who use such strategies and respond sensitively to children’s emotions tend to have children who are more effective at emotion regulation, are less fearful and fussy, more likely to express positive emotions, easier to soothe, more engaged in environmental exploration, and have enhanced social skills in the toddler and preschool years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Understanding others ===

==== Social referencing ====
Starting at about 8-10 months, infants begin to engage in social referencing, in which they refer to another, often an adult or caregiver, to inform their reaction to environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the classic visual cliff experiments, 12 month old babies who were separated from their mothers by a plexiglass floor that appeared to represent a dangerous “cliff” looked to their mothers for a cue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorce|first=James F.|last2=Emde|first2=Robert N.|last3=Campos|first3=Joseph J.|last4=Klinnert|first4=Mary D.|date=1985|title=Maternal emotional signaling: Its effect on the visual cliff behavior of 1-year-olds.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0012-1649.21.1.195|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=21|issue=1|pages=195–200|doi=10.1037//0012-1649.21.1.195|issn=0012-1649}}&lt;/ref&gt; When mothers responded to their infants with facial expressions signaling encouragement and happiness, most infants crossed over the cliff. In contrast, if mothers displayed fear or anger, most infants did not cross.

As infants age, their social referencing capacity becomes more developed. By 14 months, infants are able to use information gained from social referencing to inform decisions outside of the immediate moment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 18 months, infants are able to socially reference interactions not directed at them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, if their caregiver responded with anger when their older brother went to take a cookie, the infant is able to harness that information and is less likely to take a cookie themselves. At this age, social referencing also begins to support children’s understanding of others, as children learn what others like and dislike based on the information gained from social referencing (e.g., facial expression). As such, if an adult reacts by smiling when given a ball but with anger when given a doll, an 18-month-old will choose to give that adult a ball, rather than a doll, regardless of their own preferences.

==== Empathy ====
From an early age, newborns are reactive to others’ distress, as evidenced by behaviors such as crying in response to another infant’s cry. As children continue to develop, they begin to display behaviors that indicate an understanding of and connection to others’ emotional states beyond the simple informational value those emotional states provide. Children at 18-30 months of age will respond to verbal and nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions or body posture, of discomfort or sadness with simple helping behaviors (e.g., giving an adult a blanket if they are shivering, rubbing their arms, and saying “brr”).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Eisenberg|first=Nancy|title=Prosocial Development|date=2015-03-23|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781118963418.childpsy315|work=Handbook of Child Psychology and Developmental Science|pages=1–47|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9781118963418|access-date=2018-11-24|last2=Spinrad|first2=Tracy L.|last3=Knafo-Noam|first3=Ariel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period (18-30 months), children become more adept and need fewer cues to engage in helping behavior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, helping behavior at this age is already dependent on the cost of helping (e.g., they are less likely to give the adult their own blanket) and the recipient of the help (e.g., children are more likely to help and show concern for caregivers than strangers or peers).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Social interactions ===
Between 3 and 6 months old, infants begin engaging in simple back and forth exchanges, often with their caregivers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These exchanges do not consist of words, but of coos, gurgles, smiles or other facial expressions, and bodily movements (e.g., lifting arms, kicking legs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Emotional-and-Social-Development-Birth-to-3-Months.aspx|title=Emotional and Social Development: Birth to 3 Months|website=HealthyChildren.org|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These back and forth exchanges mimic the turn-taking that occurs in conversations.

==== Joint attention ====
[[Joint attention]] refers to the ability of individuals to share a common point of reference or attention.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mundy|first=Peter|last2=Newell|first2=Lisa|date=2007|title=Attention, Joint Attention, and Social Cognition|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00518.x|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=16|issue=5|pages=269–274|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00518.x|issn=0963-7214|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In children, this common point of reference often is an object in the environment, such as a toy. The development of joint attention initially starts with the infants' ability to respond to joint attention bids (e.g., looking where their parent looks), and eventually develops with age to the ability to initiate joint attention by directing the attention of another to shared point of reference.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This can be done through many means, including gaze, gesture (e.g., pointing, showing), or speech. 

As early as 3-4 months of age, infants show the beginning requisites of joint attention, by looking in the general direction as adults; however, they are not consistently able to find the shared point of reference.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At 10 months, this accuracy improves,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and infants are also more discerning in their response to joint attention. For example, at this age, a 10 month old will not look in the same direction as an adult if that adult's eyes are closed, a mistake that younger children make.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Initiation of joint attention begins at approximately 1 year old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This might look like a child pointing to an airplane, then looking at their mom, and back at the airplane, as if to say "do you see that?" or "look at that!"

Joint attention is a critical social skill that drives development in other domains. Joint attention enables infants to identify the objects that adults are labeling and promotes shared back and forth communication about them. Fifteen month old infants who were engaged in interactions with caregivers that include a joint attentional focus (e.g., a toy) demonstrated more frequent communicative utterances than when not in joint attention episodes.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tomasello|first=Michael|last2=Farrar|first2=Michael Jeffrey|date=1986|title=Joint Attention and Early Language|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1130423|journal=Child Development|volume=57|issue=6|pages=1454|doi=10.2307/1130423|issn=0009-3920|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These episodes of joint engagement were predictive of later vocabulary and word learning, especially when the joint attention was focused on an object that the infant was initially attending to,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; such as when a the infant picks up a ball, then the mother engages in a joint attention episode with the infant using the ball as the shared point of reference. At later ages, when initiating joint attention, the frequency that a child combines one word with a gesture (e.g., pointing to the plane and saying "plane") is associated with earlier onset of multi-word utterances, and more complex speech overall at 3.5 years old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Preschoolers (3-6 years old) ==

=== Self-concept ===
[[Self-concept]] refers to the set of attributes, abilities, attitudes, and values that one identifies as defining who he or she is.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although some initial milestones occur before this period that support self-concept, including basic self awareness (i.e., the ability to recognize themselves in a mirror)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rochat|first=Philippe|date=2003|title=Five levels of self-awareness as they unfold early in life|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1053-8100(03)00081-3|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=12|issue=4|pages=717–731|doi=10.1016/s1053-8100(03)00081-3|issn=1053-8100|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and self-labeling of their gender,&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Citation|last=KATZ|first=PHYLLIS A.|title=Gender Identity: Development and Consequences|date=1986|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-065280-8.50007-5|work=The Social Psychology of Female–Male Relations|pages=21–67|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780120652808|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; this period involves several advances in this domain. By 42 months, children are able to describe their likes and dislikes, suggesting an developing awareness of what elicits positive and negative emotions in themselves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 5 years old, children demonstrate agreement with their mothers' ratings of their behavior on basic behavioral indicators of personality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==== Gender identity ====
During the preschool period, children are deepening their [[gender identity]] and integrating gender [[socialization]] information into their self-concept.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Preschoolers learn gender stereotypes quickly and definitively, ranging from toy preferences, clothes, jobs, and behaviors. These stereotypes are initially held very firmly, such that 3-4 year olds will often state that violations are not possible and that they would not want to be friends with a child who violates their stereotypes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Children acquire gender stereotypic behaviors early in the preschool period through social learning, then organize these behaviors into beliefs about themselves, forming an basic gender identity. By the end of the preschool period, children acquire ''gender constancy''''',''' an understanding of the biological basis of sex and its consistency over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Understanding others ===
Younger preschool aged children demonstrate the basics of [[theory of mind]], or the ability to take the perspective of others. However, this skill is constrained by children's limited understanding of how thoughts and beliefs, even when false, influence behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is demonstrated in the following story: ''Danny puts his toy on the shelf, then leaves the room. His friend Sally comes in, plays with the toy, and puts it in the cabinet.'' When asked where Danny will look for his toy, a young preschool aged child will state that he will look in the cabinet, therefore not recognizing Danny's current false belief about the toy's location. Between 4-6 years old, children's capacity to understand these false beliefs, and subsequently their accuracy in perspective taking, becomes strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wellman|first=Henry M.|last2=Cross|first2=David|last3=Watson|first3=Julanne|date=2001|title=Meta-Analysis of Theory-of-Mind Development: The Truth about False Belief|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-8624.00304|journal=Child Development|volume=72|issue=3|pages=655–684|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00304|issn=0009-3920|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social interactions ===

==== Play ====

Play is often cited as a central building block to children's development, so much so that it has been stated as a human right of all children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ginsburg|first=K. R.|date=2007-01-01|title=The Importance of Play in Promoting Healthy Child Development and Maintaining Strong Parent-Child Bonds|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2006-2697|journal=PEDIATRICS|volume=119|issue=1|pages=182–191|doi=10.1542/peds.2006-2697|issn=0031-4005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity and diversity of play increases immensely in the preschool years, most notably with the onset of cooperative play, where children work toward a common goal, and socio-dramatic play (a type of cooperative play), where children act out make believe scenes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Socio-dramatic play is rooted in the child's real-life experiences, falling into three categories: family scenes (e.g., "playing house" with assigned mommy and daddy roles), character scenes (e.g., being Batman, or a princess), and functional scenes (e.g., playing doctor).&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashiabi|first=Godwin S.|date=2007-04-17|title=Play in the Preschool Classroom: Its Socioemotional Significance and the Teacher’s Role in Play|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10643-007-0165-8|journal=Early Childhood Education Journal|volume=35|issue=2|pages=199–207|doi=10.1007/s10643-007-0165-8|issn=1082-3301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperative play and socio-dramatic play both bring about increased social interactions through play, as compared to solitary play and parallel play, where children play similarly next to each other without significant interaction (e.g., two children building their own towers). It is here where play becomes intertwined with social emotional development. The characteristics of socio-dramatic play allow children to practice cooperation, negotiation, and conflict resolution skills, as well as engage in role-playing that promotes perspective taking. As such, socio-dramatic dramatic play has been associated with all of these social emotional skills in children. &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Middle childhood (7-12 years old) ==
=== Self-concept ===
Between 8-11 years old, children begin to use self-evaluations and competencies to define their sense of self.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This derives from the recently developed ability to make social comparisons. At 6 years old, these social comparisons may be to a specific individual; however, this becomes more complex in the coming years, allowing children to compare themselves and their performance to multiple individuals to arrive at a general conclusion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; School aged children also show the ability to simultaneously hold differentiated self-evaluations across domains (e.g., having good physical appearance, but poor school performance).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Gender identity ====
In middle childhood, boys and girls form peer groups segregated by gender,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; which may act to perpetuate previously learned gender stereotypes. Deriving from the ability to make social comparisons, school aged children begin to integrate attributions about how gender typical they are into their gender identity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At this age, children's ability to make more global self-evaluations also allows them to recognize contentedness or dissonance with their gender assignment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Children's gender identity on these two dimensions is significantly correlated with their self-esteem, such that children with higher levels typicality and contentedness endorse having higher self-esteem and worth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Emotional experiences ===

==== Emotion vocabulary ====
By 3 years old, children have acquired a basic vocabulary for labeling simple emotional experiences, using words such as "scared," "happy," and "mad." However, the emotional vocabulary of children grows much more rapidly during middle childhood, doubling every two years in this period before slowing down dramatically in adolescence.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baron-Cohen|first=Simon|last2=Golan|first2=Ofer|last3=Wheelwright|first3=Sally|last4=Granader|first4=Yael|last5=Hill|first5=Jacqueline|date=2010|title=Emotion Word Comprehension from 4 to 16 Years Old: A Developmental Survey|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnevo.2010.00109|journal=Frontiers in Evolutionary Neuroscience|volume=2|doi=10.3389/fnevo.2010.00109|issn=1663-070X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, at the end of the preschool period, children reliably comprehend the meaning of approximately 40 emotion words; by the time they are 11 years old, this has shown a sevenfold increase to understanding almost 300 emotion words.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

==== Display rules ====
Emotional [[display rules]] are culturally bound norms that dictate when, how, and with whom individuals can express emotions. Accordingly, the ability to enact display rules relies on children's capacity for emotional expression and emotion regulation. Socialization toward these display rules begins in infancy, and children show some capacity in the preschool period. However, children's use of display rules and understanding of their value become increasingly complex in elementary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saarni|first=Carolyn|date=1979|title=Children's understanding of display rules for expressive behavior.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.15.4.424|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=15|issue=4|pages=424–429|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.15.4.424|issn=0012-1649}}&lt;/ref&gt; As children age from 1st to 7th grade, they are less likely to outwardly express anger or sadness.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeman|first=Janice|last2=Garber|first2=Judy|date=1996|title=Display Rules for Anger, Sadness, and Pain: It Depends on Who Is Watching|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1131873|journal=Child Development|volume=67|issue=3|pages=957|doi=10.2307/1131873|issn=0009-3920|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Underwood|first=Marion K.|last2=Coie|first2=John D.|last3=Herbsman|first3=Cheryl R.|date=1992|title=Display Rules for Anger and Aggression in School-Age Children|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1992.tb01633.x|journal=Child Development|volume=63|issue=2|pages=366–380|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1992.tb01633.x|issn=0009-3920|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children also report using display rules to control their emotional expressions more with teachers than with peers,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and more than peers than with parents.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; There is some evidence to suggest that this emotional masking also increases with age throughout the school age period, at least with teachers.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Display rules also inform how children choose to express emotions; as children move from the preschool period to middle childhood, they become more likely to use verbal communication to express negative emotions than nonverbal behaviors, such as crying or hitting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Finally, at around 9 years old, bolstered by increased perspective taking skills, display rules are recognized as important to maintaining social harmony and relationships rather than simply a means to avoid punishment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Emotion regulation ====
Upon school entry, children's emotion regulation repertoire becomes increasingly diverse&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmer-Gembeck|first=Melanie J.|last2=Skinner|first2=Ellen A.|date=2010-12-21|title=Review: The development of coping across childhood and adolescence: An integrative review and critique of research|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0165025410384923|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|volume=35|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1177/0165025410384923|issn=0165-0254}}&lt;/ref&gt; as previously relied upon methods (e.g., seeking support from parents, moving away/avoiding a emotionally activating stimuli) become less effective. In middle childhood, children implement more complex distraction techniques, cognitive appraisal strategies (e.g., choosing to focus on the positive), and problem solving methods.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; At 10 years old, children's emotion regulation involves a balance of '''[[problem-focused coping]]''' and '''emotion-focused coping''' strategies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Problem-focused coping represents a change driven strategy, focused on attempting to eliminate the source of stress through proactive action (e.g., if a child feels worried about a test, choosing to study to regulate that worry). In contrast, emotion-focused coping is acceptance based and can be more effective when the stressor can not be easily changed or removed (e.g., if a child is disappointed about their grade on the test, using strategies to reduce disappointment in the moment: ''"this will help me know what to study for the final"''). 

And although diversification of emotion regulation strategy use occurs at this age, school aged children continue to strengthen their use of previous regulation strategies as well. Notably, school age children continue to seek out regulation support, but not just from their parents, but increasingly from teachers and peers in this period.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Children also show a developmental progression in differentiation of who to go to for emotional support given then specific situations.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Thus on the whole, by the beginning of adolescence, children have been become more skilled emotion regulators on the whole. 

== Adolescence (13-18 years old) ==

=== Self-concept ===

==== Identity development ====
As adolescents navigate an increasingly diverse social world, their self-concept shifts to create and accommodate an organized understanding of how situational factors may influence their behavior (e.g., how and why behavior is different with friends as compared to with parents).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With this added complexity, a fundamental task of adolescence is considered forming a unified, coherent identity, inclusive of traits, values, and goals. [[Erik Erikson]] theorized that adolescence is characterized by a period of exploration and commitments. The combination of these two traits resulted in four identity statuses:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waterman|first=Alan S.|date=1982|title=Identity development from adolescence to adulthood: An extension of theory and a review of research.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0012-1649.18.3.341|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=18|issue=3|pages=341–358|doi=10.1037//0012-1649.18.3.341|issn=0012-1649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Identity achievement:''' a status characterized by a past period of exploration, and subsequent commitment to values and goals
* '''Moratorium:''' a status characterized by continued active exploration, without commitment
* '''Foreclosure:''' a status characterized by strong commitment to a prescribed identity (e.g., by teachers, parents), without a previous period of self exploration
* '''Diffusion:''' a status characterized by both a lack of exploration and a lack of commitment

Past research suggests that over the course of high school, the distribution of identity statuses changes, such that many adolescents begin high school in a Diffusion status, but many adolescents reach Identity Achievement status at the end of high school.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This general pattern is echoed in specific studies of minority group [[Ethnic group|ethnic identity]] development, where youth initially have an unexplored ethnic identity, then enter a moratorium phase, followed by ethnic identity achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phinney|first=Jean S.|date=1989|title=Stages of Ethnic Identity Development in Minority Group Adolescents|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0272431689091004|journal=The Journal of Early Adolescence|volume=9|issue=1-2|pages=34–49|doi=10.1177/0272431689091004|issn=0272-4316|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Identity Achievement and Moratorium statuses appear to be associated with positive psychological adjustment, including higher self-esteem, goal-oriented behavior, self-efficacy, and openness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Social interactions ===

==== Friendships ====
Adolescence is a time in which peer relationships become increasingly important and frequent. In this period, adolescents reliably spend approximately twice as much time with their peers than with their parents.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryan|first=Allison M.|date=2000|title=Peer Groups as a Context for the Socialization of Adolescents' Motivation, Engagement, and Achievement in School|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15326985ep3502_4|journal=Educational Psychologist|volume=35|issue=2|pages=101–111|doi=10.1207/s15326985ep3502_4|issn=0046-1520|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, there is a developmental shift occurring in the quality and nature of friendships in this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bukowski|first=William M.|last2=Hoza|first2=Betsy|last3=Boivin|first3=Michel|date=1993|title=Popularity, friendship, and emotional adjustment during early adolescence|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cd.23219936004|journal=New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development|volume=1993|issue=60|pages=23–37|doi=10.1002/cd.23219936004|issn=1520-3247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents' friendships are characterized by increased emotional support, intimacy, closeness, and loyalty. This is contrasted to friendships in early childhood, which is built upon time spent in joint activities, and middle childhood, which is defined by reciprocity and helping behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Close friendships in adolescence can act as a buffer against the negative impacts of stressors, provide a foundation for intimacy and conflict resolution necessary in romantic relationships, and promote empathy for others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Peer acceptance ====
Peer acceptance is both related to children's prior social emotional development and predictive of later developments in this domain. [[Sociometric status]] identifies five classifications of peer acceptance in children based on two dimensions: social liking and social impact/visibility:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newcomb|first=Andrew F.|last2=Bukowski|first2=William M.|last3=Pattee|first3=Linda|date=1993|title=Children's peer relations: A meta-analytic review of popular, rejected, neglected, controversial, and average sociometric status.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0033-2909.113.1.99|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=113|issue=1|pages=99–128|doi=10.1037//0033-2909.113.1.99|issn=0033-2909}}&lt;/ref&gt; popular, average, rejected, neglected, and controversial. These patterns of acceptance can become self-perpetuating throughout childhood and adolescence, as rejected children are excluded from peer interactions that promote relationship skills, such as perspective taking and conflict resolution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==== Peer groups ====
During adolescence, children increasingly form peer groups, often with a common interest or values (e.g., "skaters," "jocks"), that are somewhat insular in nature (e.g., "[[Clique|cliques]]" or "crowds"). Theoretically, peer groups have been hypothesized to serve as a intermediary support source as adolescents exert independence from their family.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=B. Bradford|last2=Eicher|first2=Sue Ann|last3=Petrie|first3=Sandra|date=1986|title=The importance of peer group (“crowd”) affiliation in adolescence|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0140-1971(86)80029-x|journal=Journal of Adolescence|volume=9|issue=1|pages=73–96|doi=10.1016/s0140-1971(86)80029-x|issn=0140-1971|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by data that indicates that the importance of peer group membership to youth increases in early adolescence, followed by a decline in later adolescence.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crockett|first=Lisa|last2=Losoff|first2=Mike|last3=Petersen|first3=Anne C.|date=1984|title=Perceptions of the Peer Group and Friendship in Early Adolescence|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0272431684042004|journal=The Journal of Early Adolescence|volume=4|issue=2|pages=155–181|doi=10.1177/0272431684042004|issn=0272-4316|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Peers and peer groups at this age become important socialization agents, contributing to adolescents' sense of identity, behavior, and values.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Peer groups, whether intentionally or unintentionally, exert [[peer pressure]] and [[Operant conditioning|operant learning]] principles to shape behavior through reinforcement, resulting in members of peer groups become increasingly similar over time.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Many adolescents endorse peer influence on many aspects of their behavior, including academic engagement, risk taking, and family involvement; however, the direction of this influence varied dependent on the peer group the adolescent is affiliated with.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Assessment of social-emotional development ==
The assessment of social emotional development in young children must include an assessment of both child level factors, such as genetic disorders, physical limitations, or linguistic/cognitive developmental level, as well as contextual factors, such as family and cultural factors.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carter|first=Alice S.|last2=Briggs-Gowan|first2=Margaret J.|last3=Davis|first3=Naomi Ornstein|date=2004|title=Assessment of young children's social-emotional development and psychopathology: recent advances and recommendations for practice|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0021-9630.2003.00316.x|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|volume=45|issue=1|pages=109–134|doi=10.1046/j.0021-9630.2003.00316.x|issn=0021-9630|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular importance for young children is the caregiving context, or the parent-child relationship.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

=== Early childhood ===
The majority of measures designed to assess early childhood social emotional development are parent report questionnaires. Parent reports using such measures repeatedly indicate that the 7%-12% of children show early social-emotional problems or delays.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Increasing evidence suggests that these problems remain moderately stable over periods of 1-2 years, suggesting clinical and societal benefits to early identification and intervention.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Standardized assessments have been developed to identify social emotional concerns as young as 6 months old.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Below is a list of some more widely used parent-report screening measures and comprehensive assessments:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Biography==
===Year of birth===
Miller was born Alex Ford (pronounced "Aleck") on the Sara Jones Plantation in [[Tallahatchie County, Mississippi]]. The date and year of birth are uncertain. He claimed to have been born on December 5, 1899, but David Evans, professor of music and an ethnomusicologist at the [[University of Memphis]], claims to have found census records that he was born around 1912, being seven years old on February 2, 1920, the day of the census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/sonnyboy.html|title=Sonny Boy II Told His Sisters 'Keep It to Yourself' but They Told Me His Best-kept Secret|last=Donoghue|first=William E. |website=Perfect Sound Forever|date=July 1977|accessdate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonnyboy.com/index.php|quote="In the 1920 census researched at my request by Memphis-based blues expert David Evans, Alex appeared as seven years old."|title=1920 Census|website=Sonnyboy.com|accessdate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His gravestone in or near [[Tutwiler, Mississippi]], set up by record company owner [[Lillian McMurry]] twelve years after his death, gives his date of birth as March 11, 1908, but has no basis for being recognized as accurate.&lt;ref name="Cochran"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/5341|title=Sonny Boy Williamson II|website=Findagrave.com|accessdate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years===
He lived and worked with his [[sharecropper]] stepfather, Jim Miller, whose last name he soon adopted, and mother, Millie Ford, until the early 1930s. Beginning in the 1930s, he traveled around Mississippi and Arkansas and encountered [[Big Joe Williams]], [[Elmore James]] and [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]], also known as Robert Junior Lockwood, who would play guitar on his later [[Checker Records]] sides. He was also associated with [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] during this period. Miller developed his style and raffish stage persona during these years. [[Willie Dixon]] recalled seeing Lockwood and Miller playing for tips in [[Greenville, Mississippi]], in the 1930s. He entertained audiences with novelties such as inserting one end of the harmonica into his mouth and playing with no hands. At this time he was often known as "Rice" Miller—a childhood nickname stemming from his love of rice and milk&lt;ref name="Mojo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celticguitarmusic.com/Harmsb2.htm|title='Fessor Mojo on Rice Miller (Sonny Boy II)|website=Celticguitarmusic.com|last=Donoughue|first=William|accessdate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;—or as "Little Boy Blue".&lt;ref name="Cabin"/&gt;

In 1941 Miller was hired to play the ''[[King Biscuit Time]]'' show, advertising the King Biscuit brand of baking flour on radio station [[KFFA (AM)|KFFA]] in [[Helena, Arkansas]], with Lockwood. The program's sponsor, Max Moore, began billing Miller as Sonny Boy Williamson, apparently in an attempt to capitalize on the fame of the well-known Chicago-based harmonica player and singer [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|Sonny Boy Williamson]] (birth name John Lee Curtis Williamson, died 1948). Although John Lee Williamson was a major blues star who had already released dozens of successful and widely influential records under the name "Sonny Boy Williamson" from 1937 onward, Miller would later claim to have been the first to use the name. Some blues scholars believe that Miller's assertion he was born in 1899 was a ruse to convince audiences he was old enough to have used the name before John Lee Williamson, who was born in 1914.

===Radio show in West Memphis===
In 1949, Williamson relocated to [[West Memphis, Arkansas]], and lived with his sister and her husband, [[Howlin' Wolf]]. (Later, for Checker Records, he did a parody of Howlin' Wolf, entitled "Like Wolf".) He started his own KWEM radio show from 1948 to 1950, selling the elixir [[Hadacol]]. He brought his King Biscuit musician friends to West Memphis—Elmore James, [[Houston Stackhouse]], Arthur "Big Boy" Crudup, Robert Nighthawk and others—to perform on KWEM radio. Williamson married Howlin' Wolf's half-sister Mae and he showed Wolf how to play harmonica.&lt;ref name="Mojo"/&gt;

===Recording career===
Williamson's first recording session took place in 1951 for [[Lillian McMurry]] of [[Trumpet Records]], based in [[Jackson, Mississippi]].  It was three years since the death of John Lee Williamson, which for the first time allowed some legitimacy to Miller's carefully worded claim to being "the one and only Sonny Boy Williamson". When Trumpet went bankrupt in 1955, Williamson's recording contract was yielded to its creditors, who sold it to [[Chess Records]] in Chicago. He had begun developing a following in Chicago beginning in 1953, when he appeared there as a member of Elmore James's band. During his Chess years he enjoyed his greatest success and acclaim, recording about 70 songs for the Chess subsidiary [[Checker Records]] from 1955 to 1964. His first [[LP record]] was a compilation of previously released singles.  Titled ''[[Down and Out Blues]]'', Checker released the collection in 1959.  A single, "Boppin' with Sonny" backed with "No Nights by Myself", was released by [[Ace Records (United States)|Ace Records]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.globaldogproductions.info/a/ace.html|title=Ace Records discography|website=Globaldogproductions.info|accessdate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s European tours===
In the early 1960s he toured Europe several times during the height of the British blues craze, backed on a number of occasions by the Authentics (see ''[[American Folk Blues Festival]]''), recording with the [[The Yardbirds|Yardbirds]] (for the album ''[[Sonny Boy Williamson and the Yardbirds]]'') and [[the Animals]], and appearing on several television broadcasts throughout Europe. Around this time he was quoted as saying of the backing bands who accompanied him, "those British boys want to play the blues real bad, and they do". Led Zeppelin biographer [[Stephen Davis (music journalist)|Stephen Davis]] writes in ''[[Hammer of the Gods (book)|Hammer of the Gods]]'', while in England Williamson set his hotel room on fire while trying to cook a rabbit in a coffee percolator. The book also maintains that future Led Zeppelin vocalist [[Robert Plant]] stole one of the bluesman's harmonicas at one of these shows. [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] wrote in his blues history "Deep Blues", that during this tour Williamson allegedly stabbed a man during a street fight and left the country abruptly.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Sonny Boy took a liking to the European fans, and while there had a custom-made, two-tone suit tailored personally for him, along with a bowler hat, matching umbrella, and an attaché case for his harmonicas. He appears credited as "Big Skol" on [[Roland Kirk]]'s live album ''[[Kirk in Copenhagen]]'' (1963).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.jazzdisco.org/roland-kirk/catalog/#mercury-mg-20894|title=Roland Kirk Catalog|website=Jazzdisco.org|accessdate=2014-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his final recordings from England, in 1964, featured him singing "I'm Trying to Make London My Home", with [[Hubert Sumlin]] providing the guitar.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Death===
Upon his return to the U.S., he resumed playing the King Biscuit Time show on KFFA, and performed in the Helena, Arkansas area. As fellow musicians Houston Stackhouse and Peck Curtis waited at the KFFA studios for Williamson on May 25, 1965, the 12:15 broadcast time was approaching and Williamson was nowhere in sight. Peck left the radio station to locate Williamson, and discovered his body in bed at the rooming house where he had been staying, dead of an apparent heart attack suffered in his sleep the night before. &lt;!-- hence died May 24 --&gt; Williamson is buried on New Africa Road, just outside Tutwiler, Mississippi at the site of the former Whitman Chapel cemetery.  Trumpet Records owner McMurry provided the headstone with an incorrect date of death.&lt;ref name="Cochran"/&gt;

==Naming==
The recordings made by John Lee Williamson between 1937 and his death in 1948 and those made between 1951 and 1964 by "Rice" Miller were all originally issued under the name Sonny Boy Williamson. It is believed that Miller adopted the name to suggest to audiences (and to his first record label) that he was the "original" Sonny Boy.&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xp5ce8I_sbQC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=%22sonny+boy+williamson+i%22+%22sonny+boy+williamson+ii%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YhUUVYfxMIKfoQSQ5oHICQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sonny%20boy%20williamson%20i%22%20%22sonny%20boy%20williamson%20ii%22&amp;f=false  |author=Barry, Sam|title=How to Play the Harmonica and Other Life Lessons''|pages=89–90|accessdate=2015-09-06|website=Books.google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; To differentiate between the two musicians, scholars and biographers have referred to John Lee Williamson (1914–1948) as "Sonny Boy Williamson I" or "the original Sonny Boy" and to Miller (circa 1912–1965) as "Sonny Boy Williamson II".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S83cUNmQXTEC&amp;pg=PA267&amp;lpg=PA267&amp;dq=%22Sonny+Boy+Williamson+I%22+%22Sonny+Boy+Williamson+II%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OvD7F-sN_W&amp;sig=8CQKQQTD4p60m39NA-wYdlzIlNU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tXMWVavVLdLraJ6igPgI&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCTge#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sonny%20Boy%20Williamson%20I%22%20%22Sonny%20Boy%20Williamson%20II%22&amp;f=false |title=The Rough Guide to Chicago – Rich McHugh |page=267 |website=Books.google.co.uk |date=July 1, 2009 |accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Were music''' ({{Lang-yo|Wéré}}) is an indigenous [[Yoruba music]], which, like [[ajisari]], is a way of using [[music]] to arouse the [[Islamic]] faithful to pray and feast during [[Ramadan]] festival in Yorubaland. '''Ajiwere''' or '''oniwere''' means "one who performs were music." 

Unlike ajisari, were is performed in groups. Usually young men or boys, numbering up to ten or more, come together to write songs and practise dance moves. Again unlike ajisari, who sleep a bit and only come out at 2:00 in the morning, the "ajiwere" or "oniwere" leave their homes each night shortly after the [[Isha'a]] (8:00 PM) and [[Tarawih]] prayers. They'll then roam the streets singing and dancing till about 4:00 AM when they disperse to go prepare for that day's fasting. A couple of days before the end of [[Ramadan]], all of the "ajiwere" or "oniwere" groups in the area meet in a townhall to compete for prizes—the grand prize is a shiny silver-plated trophy. 

In early 1970s, were music genre became popular and forced its way into the mainstream [[Yoruba culture]] alongside other popular genres like [[sakara music|sakara]], [[apala]], [[waka music]], and [[sekere]]. The music was popularized by certain [[Ibadan]] singers/songwriters such as, the late [[Alhaji Dauda Epo-Akara]], Ganiyu Kuti or Gani Irefin, and their [[Lagos]] counterparts led by [[Ayinde Barrister|Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister]]. The Were singers started playing at parties and concerts in both Ibadan and Lagos. Ultimately, Alhaji Dauda Epo-Akara started producing some hit SP and LP records. Although Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister was already popular in Lagos, but it was Alhaji Dauda Epo-Akara who introduced him to the very important Ibadan music lovers on one of his popular LPs, which he used to pay a professional homage to the influential record marketers of Ogunpa district in Ibadan. Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister would later create another musical genre called [[Fuji music]], which was an offshoot of were music.

The '''Worji''' ({{lang-om|Warjiih}}, {{lang-gez|ወርጄ}}, {{lang-ar|ورجي}} {{IPA-am|wɔrdʒi|}}), fully known as the '''Tigri-Worji''', are an ethnic group inhabiting [[Ethiopia]]. The prefix for their traditional name, '''''Tigri''''', comes from the word ''Tijaari'', which is an adjectival in the [[Arabic language]] that literally translates to "merchant." Their tribal name '''''Worji''''' is eponymous with the name of their ancestral homeland. Thus, Tigri Werji essentially means "merchant of Werji."&lt;ref name="jeberti"&gt;[http://www.jeberti.com/Or_index.php?jbr=wergi+jeberti "The Tigri Wergi 'Jeberti' People"], Chapter 1 pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Worji were among the first people in the [[Horn of Africa]] to become Muslim, having accepted Islam by the 8th century. Alongside another ancient Muslim group to their west, the Gebel, who would eventually procreate the [[Argobba people]], the Worji participated in many battles against Christian [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]]. They sided with the [[Ifat Sultanate|Ifat]] and [[Shewa Sultanate]] as they rose to power in the Middle Ages, especially during the [[Abyssinian-Adal War]]. These warriors were reported to be very skilled in warfare. Although they were not under the direct control of either empire, they acted as a supporting force for neighboring Muslim kingdoms during times of reprisal against Abyssinia. It was this time of military conflict that opened the door for the northerly expansion of Oromos, and thus began the assimilation of conquered populations, such as the Worji. It is based on this historical tale that some members classify themselves as a separate ethnicity. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that over centuries of living in Oromiyaa, the Worji have well assimilated among the Oromo, with no cultural distinction evident between the two.

==Demographics==
The Worji historically populated an area in south-eastern Ethiopia within the [[Oromia Region|Oromiyaa Region]]. Today, they are found primarily in their modern hometown of [[Daleti]] and in numerous pastoral communities scattered throughout the regions of [[Shewa]] and [[Debub Wollo Zone|Wollo]]. Some have settled in major cities within these former provinces, most prominently in [[Addis Ababa]] and [[Kemise]]. Due to their longstanding livelihoods as merchants, members of the Worji community can be found transiently in cities all across Ethiopia

According to the 2007 Ethiopian census carried out by the [[Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)|Central Statistical Agency]], the Worji population numbered 13,232 individuals.&lt;ref name="census"/&gt;

==Language==
The Worji primarily speak [[Oromo language|Afaan Oromoo]] as their mother tongue (14,066 in 1994) and [[Amharic language|Amharic]] as a second language, although this order of primacy may be vice versa depending on where a person lives. Both languages belong to the larger [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family.

Having lived in Shewa ever since it was a [[Sultanate of Showa|Gurage kingdom]], there is a possibility that the Worji may have originally spoken an East [[Gurage language|Gurage]] language. Throughout their history of existence as a people, however, they have never had a language of their own, but rather spoke the languages of their neighbors. This can be attributed to the fact that they never settled in one place for very long due to their constant trading expeditions. Today, they are one of the few ethnic groups in Ethiopia without their own language.

==Politics==
Prior to the [[Ethiopian general elections, 2010|2010 General Elections]], the current Ethiopian regime approved the creation of the ''Tigri Worgi Nationality Democratic Organization,'' which represents a minority of the tribe.&lt;ref name="party"&gt;[http://www.electionethiopia.org/en/political-parties/active-political-parties.html "National Electoral Board of Ethiopia: List of Registered Political Parties"]&lt;/ref&gt;
