'''Antonio Ballester''' (died 1387) was the [[Latin Archbishop of Athens]] from 27 March 1370, when appointed by [[Pope Urban VI]], until his death. He was a [[Catalan people|Catalan]], a [[Franciscan]], and a bachelor of theology. He is the only well-known archbishop of Athens from the fourteenth century. During his stay in Athens, he lived in an annex of the [[Erechtheum]].

Ballester was elected to his archbishopric with the support of the [[Republic of Venice]] and he had influence himself in Italy. Ballester supported [[Peter IV of Aragon]] against [[Maria, Queen of Sicily|Maria of Sicily]] in 1381. He also supported the [[Crown of Aragon]] over and against the [[Navarrese Company]]. In November 1379 Sibilia, queen of Peter IV, tried to procure those relics of the Virgin which were kept at Athens from Ballester and since they were absent the [[Parthenon]] in 1395, it seems likely that she succeeded.

On his death, [[John I of Aragon]] requested [[Antipope Clement VII]] to appoint one Antonio de Blasis to the vacant see. While some modern historians have doubted that Ballester was in fact dead when John requested the appointment of de Blasis, it has now been proven that he was. It was sometimes held that Ballester had in fact been captured by [[Nerio I Acciajuoli]] and later crowned [[Martin of Aragon]] in 1399, but this is false and arose from a confusion of the two Antonios.

'''Arthur Jeffrey Dempster''' (August 14, 1886 – March 11, 1950) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]]-[[United States|American]] [[physicist]] best known for his work in [[mass spectrometry]] and his discovery in 1935 of the [[uranium]] [[isotope]] [[uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Allison | first = Samuel K. | title = Arthur Jeffrey Dempster 1886–1950 | url = http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/dempster-arthur.pdf | publisher = [[National Academy of Sciences]] | year = 1952  | accessdate = 13 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
[[Image:Dempster Mass Spectrometer.gif|left|250 px|thumb|Dempster's 180 degree magnetic sector mass analyzer.]]
Dempster was born in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.  He received his [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] and [[master's degree]]s at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1909 and 1910, respectively.  He travelled to study in [[Germany]], and then left at the outset of [[World War I]] for the [[United States]]; there he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in physics at the [[University of Chicago]].

==Academic career==
Dempster joined the [[physics]] faculty at the University of Chicago in 1916 and remained there until his death in 1950.

During [[World War II]] he worked on the secret [[Manhattan Project]] to develop the world's first [[nuclear weapon]]s.

From 1943 to 1946, Dempster was chief physicist of the University of Chicago's [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] or "Met Lab" which integrally related to the Manhattan Project and founded to study the materials necessary for the manufacture of atomic bombs.

In 1946, he took a position as a division director at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]].

Dempster died on March 11, 1950 in [[Stuart, Florida]] at the age of 63.

==Research==
In 1918, Dempster developed the first modern [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]], a scientific apparatus allowing physicists to identify compounds by the mass of elements in a sample, and determine the isotopic composition of elements in a sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A New Method of Positive Ray Analysis |journal=Phys. Rev.|date=April 1918|first=A. J.|last=Dempster|volume=11|issue=4|pages=316–325|doi= 10.1103/PhysRev.11.316|url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v11/p316|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-11-24 |bibcode = 1918PhRv...11..316D }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dempster's mass spectrometer was over 100 times more accurate than previous versions, and established the basic theory and design of mass spectrometers that is still used to this day.  Dempster's research over his career centered on the mass spectrometer and its applications, leading in 1935 to his discovery of the uranium isotope &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayinsci.com/8/8_14.htm |title=Today in Science History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/124_print.html|title=85 Innovations 1917-193 |last1= Armstrong|first1=David |last2=Burke |first2=Monte |date=December 23, 2002 |work=Forbes |publisher= |accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This isotope's ability to cause a rapidly expanding [[Nuclear fission|fission]] [[nuclear chain reaction]] allowed the development of the [[atom bomb]] and [[nuclear power]].  Dempster was also well known as an authority on [[positive ray]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4640">The '''Association of British Secretaries in America''' (ABSA) was a New York-based organization of the 1960s and 1970s consisting of [[secretary|secretaries]] from the United Kingdom who had come to the United States to work and live.

The creation of the association appears to have taken place in New York in 1961.&lt;ref name="nycomp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nycompaniesindex.com/association-of-british-secretaries-in-america-ltd-2xl5/ | title=Association of British Secretaries in America, Ltd. | publisher=New York Companies | accessdate=September 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, there was a steady demand for young British women to come to the U.S. and fill temporary or permanent secretarial positions.&lt;ref name="np1960"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/17196696/ | title=Newest British Import – Girls for Secretarial Jobs | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[Rhinelander Daily News]] | date=November 21, 1960 | page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gh1967"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19670929&amp;id=Dn9AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vaMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3592,5076232 | title=Secretaries wanted across the Atlantic | first=Barbara | last=Scot | newspaper=[[The Glasgow Herald]] | date=September 29, 1967 | page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reasons stated for the demand included a secretarial shortage in the U.S., better aptitude and seriousness for detail work among the British, and the perceived prestige in the U.S. of having an [[English accent]] answer the phone.&lt;ref name="np1960"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gh1967"/&gt;  For the British women who came over, there was a chance for better pay and advancement in the U.S. than within the [[British class system]].&lt;ref name="np1960"/&gt;

The association's stated purpose was that it "offers assistance to members seeking jobs and apartments, and generally helps girls new to this country to settle in New York."&lt;ref name="nym"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-MCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA34 | title=English Girls in New York: They Don't Go Home Again | first=Caroline | last=Seebohm | magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] | date=July 19, 1971 | pages=34–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also helped members navigate the New York social and dating scene, and the association threw parties of their own as well.&lt;ref name="nym"/&gt;

The association is remembered for one unusual recorded vocal chorus effort, when they performed [[IBM]] corporate spirit songs on the 1969 album ''Paean''.&lt;ref name="paean"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102651536 | title=Paean: an ACT/Inter-ACT Communication | publisher=[[Computer History Museum]] | accessdate=August 31, 2014}} Also {{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.com/PAEAN-AN-ACT-INTER-ACT-COMMUNICATION/dp/B004XBRCEO | title=Paean An ACT/Inter-ACT Communication | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The album was the idea of the computer software and consulting company [[Advanced Computer Techniques]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Computer Establishment | first=Katharine Davis | last=Fishman | publisher= [[McGraw-Hill Book Company]] | location=New York | year=1981 | type=paperback 1982 | page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of whose secretaries at the time came from England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=An Interview with Oscar Schachter | first=Thomas | last=Haigh | publisher=[[Charles Babbage Institute]], [[University of Minnesota]] | location=Minneapolis | year=2004 | url=http://purl.umn.edu/107622 | pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The album's songs and recordings were judged as "quite endearing" by ''[[InfoWorld]]'' magazine some years later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_S4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 | title=Tracking Down the IBM Songbook Department | first=John C. | last=Dvorak | magazine=[[InfoWorld]] | date=August 19, 1985 | page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; and software design pioneer [[Larry Constantine]] subsequently described the association's role on the record with just one word: "indeed!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Larry L. | last=Constantine | authorlink=Larry Constantine | title=The Peopleware Papers: Notes on the Human Side of Software | publisher=Yourdon Press | year=2001 | edition=2nd | page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1971, the association had about 80 members.&lt;ref name="nym"/&gt;  At meetings they discussed, or heard from speakers on, topics such as safety, cultural trips, vacations, and techniques for [[shorthand]].&lt;ref name="nym"/&gt;  A similar organization at the time was the [[Society of International Secretaries]].

'''Beth A. Brown''' (July 15, 1969 – October 5, 2008) was a [[NASA]] [[astrophysicist]].

== Biography ==
Brown was born in [[Roanoke, Virginia]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bregman|first1=Joel|title=Obituary: Beth Brown (1969-2008)|journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society|date=1 January 2011|volume=43|issue=1|pages=004|doi=10.3847/BAASOBIT2011004|bibcode=2011BAAS...43..004B}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from [[William Fleming High School]] in 1987 as valedictorian.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt; She studied astrophysics at [[Howard University]], graduating summa cum laude in 1991. While at Howard University, she played piccolo in several University bands. She joined [[Tau Beta Sigma]] in Fall 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Eta Delta Chapter at Howard University - Lineage| work = Tau Beta Sigma Eta Delta| accessdate = 2015-04-09| url = http://www.etadeltatbs.com/?_escaped_fragment_=lines/cfvg#!lines/cfvg}}&lt;/ref&gt; She earned her M.S. in astronomy from the [[University of Michigan]] and a  Ph.D. from there in 1998. She was the first African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan's Department of Astronomy.&lt;ref name="APS"/&gt; Her research there concerned X-ray observations of [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] from the Röntgen Satellite.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;

Brown joined life
 [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) as a post-doctoral research associate with the [[National Academy of Sciences]]/[[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]]. She became a post-doctoral research associate for the [[National Space Science Data Center]] (NSSDC) in 2001. She transferred to the X-ray Astrophysics Laboratory in 2005, providing support for the GSFC XMM Guest Observer Facility. She was hired as Assistant Director for Science Communication and Higher Education for the Sciences and Exploration Director at Goddard. She also completed a NASA Administrator Fellowship where she devoted a year to research with Dr. James Lindesay and taught classes with Dr. Demetrius Venable at Howard's Department of Physics and Astronomy. Brown served as the Administrative Executive Officer for NSBP  for two years and was involved with the National Conference of Black Physics Students (NCBPS).&lt;ref name="APS"&gt;{{cite web|title=In Memoriam: Beth Brown|url=http://www.aps.org/programs/minorities/honors/brown.cfm|publisher=[[American Physical Society]]|accessdate=20 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220062941/http://www.aps.org/programs/minorities/honors/brown.cfm|archivedate=20 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her PhD, Beth Brown held a National Academy of Science &amp; National Research Council Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. Subsequently, she served at the National Space Science Data Center at Goddard, where she was involved in data archival activities as well as education and outreach.  In 2006, Brown became an Astrophysics Fellow at Goddard, during which time she worked as a visiting Assistant Professor at Howard University.    At Goddard, she was NSSDC's primary interface to such Science Archive Research Centers (SARCs) as the High Energy Astrophysics SARC at Goddard, the Multi-Mission Archive at STScI (MAST) and the Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) at Caltech. She also helped to "rationalize" NSSDC's legacy holdings of astrophysics data in light of data supported at the SARCs which are also to be permanently archived at NSSDC.     At the time of her death, she was looking forward to a new position at GSFC as the Assistant Director for Science Communications and Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[Image:Clement Scott.png|250px|thumb|right|Clement Scott, from a copy of the ''Theatre'' magazine, aged about 40]]

'''Clement William Scott''' (6 October 1841 – 25 June 1904) was an influential English theatre critic for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' and other journals, and a playwright, lyricist, translator and travel writer, in the final decades of the 19th century.  His style of criticism, acerbic, flowery and (perhaps most importantly) carried out on the first night of productions, set the standard for theatre reviewers through to today.

Scott accumulated enemies among theatre managers, actors and playwrights as years went on, picking quarrels with [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]], [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], [[George Bernard Shaw]] and others.  After he gave a particularly ill-considered 1898 interview, in which he attacked the morals of theatre people, especially actresses, he was forced to retire as a theatre critic and his reputation and prospects suffered badly until, by the end of his life, he was impoverished.

==Life and career==
Born the son of [[William Scott (Vicar of St Olave's, Jewry)|William Scott]], the perpetual curate of [[Hoxton]] in north London, Scott converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] before his 21st birthday. Educated at [[Marlborough College]], he became a civil servant, working in the [[War Office]] beginning in 1860.&lt;ref name=Burner&gt;Burner, Alma J. [http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=3493 "A Chapter of the London Stage: The Clement Scott Papers"], Vol. XXVII, Winter 1973–1974, No. 2, University of Rochester Library Bulletin, University of Rochester, accessed 1 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Emeljanow, Victor. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101035982/ "Scott, Clement William (1841–1904)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 1 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Encouraged to write by the humorist [[Tom Hood]] the younger, who also was a clerk in the War Office, Scott contributed to ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', ''Weekly Dispatch'', and to Hood's own paper, ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'', where Scott and [[W. S. Gilbert]] were colleagues.  Scott's interest in writing and the theatre led him to brief dalliance with the failed ''Victoria Review''.&lt;ref name=Burner/&gt;

He became the dramatic writer for ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' in 1863 but held the position for only two years because of the intemperance of his published opinions and his unpopular praise of the French theatre.  In 1871, Scott began his nearly thirty years as a theatre critic with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. He also contributed regularly to ''The Theatre'', a magazine that he founded, and wrote sentimental poetry and song lyrics (including "[[Oh Promise Me]]"), which were often published in the magazine ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' by his friend, the editor, [[F. C. Burnand]].  Scott continued to work at the War Office until 1879, when he finally decided to earn his living entirely by writing.&lt;ref name=Burner/&gt;&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

As well as criticism, Scott wrote plays, including ''The Vicarage'', ''The Cape Mail'', ''Anne Mié'', ''Odette'', and ''The Great Divorce Case''.  He wrote several English adaptations of [[Victorien Sardou]]'s plays, some of which were written in collaboration with [[B. C. Stephenson]], such as ''Nos intimes'' (as ''Peril'') and ''Dora'' (1878, as ''Diplomacy''). The latter was described by the theatrical paper ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' as "the great dramatic hit of the season".&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 23 June 1878, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; It also played with success at [[Wallack's Theatre]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 7 April 1878, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Scott and Stephenson also wrote an English version of [[Ludovic Halévy|Halévy]] and [[Henri Meilhac|Meilhac]]'s libretto for [[Charles Lecocq|Lecocq]]'s operetta ''Le Petit Duc'' (1878). Their adaptation so pleased the composer that he volunteered to write some new music for the English production.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 28 April 1878, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; For all of these, Scott adopted the pen name "Saville Rowe" (after [[Savile Row]]) to match Stephenson's pseudonym, "Bolton Rowe", another Mayfair street.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 24 September 1876, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The pieces with Stephenson were produced by the [[Squire Bancroft|Bancrofts]], the producers of [[Thomas William Robertson|T. W. Robertson]]'s plays, which Scott admired. He also wrote accounts of holiday tours around the [[British Isles]] and abroad, becoming known for his florid style. Scott's travels also inspired his creative writing. Some sources say that after a tour of New Zealand, he wrote the tune to the "Swiss Cradle Song", later adapted as "[[Now Is the Hour (song)|Now Is the Hour]]"&lt;ref&gt;Scowcroft, Philip L. [http://www.musicweb-international.com/garlands/206.htm "A 206th Garland of British Composers], June 2001, MusicWeb International, accessed 1 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and as "Haere Ra", the [[Māori people|Māori]] farewell song, which white New Zealanders "mistakenly thought [to be] an old Maori folksong".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,779550,00.html "Music: Now Is the Hour"], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', 19 January 1948&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used for the hymn "Search Me, O God", with lyrics by [[J. Edwin Orr]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hymntime.com/tch/htm/s/e/searchme.htm &amp;ldquo;Search Me, O God&amp;rdquo;] at the ''Cyber Hymnal''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, an Australian family has long claimed that the "Clement Scott" who wrote the tune is a pseudonym for a family member.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, Terry.

===''Poppyland'' and later years===
In 1883, the ''Daily Telegraph'' printed an article which Scott had written about a visit to the north [[Norfolk]] coast. He became enamoured of the district and gave it the name ''[[Poppyland]]''.  His writing was responsible for members of the London theatre set visiting and investing in homes in the area.  Ironically, he was unhappy at the result of his popularisation of this previously pristine area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://norfolkcoast.co.uk/pasttimes/pt_louiejermy.htm "Norfolk History and Past Times – Louie Jeremy"], Norfolkcoast.co.uk, 2005, accessed 21 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://norfolkcoast.co.uk/pasttimes/pt_gardenofsleep.htm "Norfolk History and Past Times – Garden of Sleep"], Norfolkcoast.co.uk, 2005, accessed 21 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Clement Scott.JPG|thumb|right|Clement Scott memorial at [[Cromer]], Norfolk]]
Scott married Isabel Busson du Maurier, the sister of [[George du Maurier]], and the couple had four children. She died in 1890, and he remarried Constance Margarite Brandon, an American journalist and actress, in San Francisco.  Scott's long-time wish to be elected a member of the famous literary gentlemen's club, the [[Garrick Club]] (to which [[Henry Irving]], Gilbert and [[Arthur Sullivan]], among many other notable men belonged), was finally realised in 1892. After an ill-considered 1898 interview in ''Great Thoughts'', Scott was forced to retire as a theatre critic and moved to [[Biarritz]] to write ''The Drama of Yesterday and Today''.  He then worked for a couple of years at the end of the century for the ''[[New York Herald]]'', later returning to London.  In 1900, he founded ''The Free Lance, a Popular Society and Critical Journal'', for writers who worked by the job, which he edited.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Scott fell into illness and poverty in his last years and died at his residence in [[Woburn Square]] at the age of 62.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1904/06/26/archives/death-of-clement-scott-once-powerful-theatrical-critic-expires-in.html "Death of Clement Scott"], ''The New York Times'', 26 June 1904, p. 7 (subscription required); and "A Dramatic End", ''London Evening News'', 25 June 1904, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style, controversies and influence==
[[File:Mr Clement Scott Plays on One String Now.png|thumb|upright|left|Scott playing the ''Daily Telegraph'' violin (1897)]]
Scott's position on the ''Daily Telegraph'' and the support of its proprietor, J. M. Levy, allowed him to pioneer the essay-style review of drama, which came to replace the earlier bare notices. His column of notes and reviews became very popular throughout Britain, and later his own magazine, ''The Theatre'', achieved wide circulation.  He wrote his theatre reviews immediately after he saw the opening night of a piece which, together with his short temper and his dislike of critic [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]], the chief English supporter of [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], tended to involve him often in controversies.&lt;ref name=Burner/&gt;

Scott played an important part in encouraging a more attentive attitude by theatre audiences. In his early days, it was not uncommon for audiences to be very boisterous and noisy, frequently booing and talking during productions, especially through the overture. He also insisted on first night reviews.  It had been common for reviewers to wait a few days before writing about a production. Scott insisted that the paying audience on the first night should expect to see a fully fledged production, and not one where the leading characters did not know all their lines.  Theatre managers disliked the opening night reviews when they felt that a new piece had not had time to settle down yet.&lt;ref name=Gillan1&gt;Gillan, Don. [http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/th-critic.html "The Fall of Clement Scott"], StageBeauty.net, 2007, accessed 13 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Scott supported actor-managers of his time by providing them with translations of popular French plays and with his own plays.

[[Image:Constable Clement Scott.png|thumb|upright|Scott in the ''Entr'acte'' in 1898, when he accused Ibsen and Shaw of being harmful to society]]
Early in his career, he wrote approvingly of the "cup and saucer" realism movement, led by T. W. Robertson, whose plays were notable for treating contemporary British subjects in realistic settings.  Later, he favoured the grand and spectacular type of London theatrical production which had developed with new types of theatre building, electric lighting and technologies allowed more and more adventurous staging.  As time went on, he became strongly conservative and opposed to the new drama of Ibsen and [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]], arguing that domestic intrigue, sexual situations and wordy philosophising were inappropriate for an evening at the theatre, and even harmful to society, especially young women. Scott especially became embroiled in legal claims through his outspoken criticism of various actors and actresses.  His scathing attacks on Ibsen and Shaw became evident in their lack of journalistic neutrality.&lt;ref name=Gillan1/&gt;

Scott outraged the theatre community with an extraordinary attack on the morals of theatre people in general, and especially of actresses, in an interview that was published in the evangelical weekly ''Great Thoughts'' in 1898. He said that the theatre warps people's character and that it was impossible for a pure woman to be successful in a stage career, and that all leading actresses were immoral and could have achieved their success only by virtue of the extent of their "compliance". Even before the publication, the transcript of the interview was released to the press, and Scott immediately received a firestorm of condemnation. Although he apologised and recanted his remarks, he was barred from theatres, and the ''Daily Telegraph'' was forced to dismiss him. He soon retired and found his reputation and prospects much diminished. By the end of his life, however, he received a measure of forgiveness, and shortly before his death the theatre community held a generous benefit for him.&lt;ref name=Gillan1/&gt;

His papers are located in the library of [[Rochester University]], New York State.  Film maker [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] (''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', ''Mrs. Brown'', ''[[Captain Corelli's Mandolin]]'') made his first feature film for the BBC, ''Poppyland'' (1985), around the story of Scott's visit to Poppyland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2884">'''Clydno Eiddin''' was a ruler in the ''[[Hen Ogledd]]'', the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]]-speaking area in what is now [[Northern England]] and southern [[Scotland]] during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. "Eiddyn" is the Brythonic name for [[Edinburgh]], implying a connection to that territory.

The [[Harleian genealogies]] give Clydno's pedigree. He is said to be the son of a certain Cinbelim or [[Cynfelyn]], the son of [[Dumnagual I of Alt Clut|Dumnagual Hen]], an early ruler of [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Alt Clut]] (later known as Strathclyde).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmatthews.org.uk/history/harleian_genealogies/7.html Harleian genealogy 7]. Retrieved August 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The later genealogy ''[[Bonedd Gwŷr y Gogledd]]'' gives an altered version of this genealogy; here Cynfelyn is Clydno's grandfather, and the family is attached to the line of the ancestor figure [[Coel Hen]].&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, pp. 256–257.&lt;/ref&gt;

An attack by Clydno and several other northern rulers on [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] in [[North Wales]] is recounted in the Gwynedd version of the Welsh laws preserved in the ''[[Book of Chirk]]''.&lt;ref name="Bromwich491"&gt;Bromwich, p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; According to the story, after Elidir Mwynfawr, a prince of the North, had been slain in Gwynedd, Clydno joined with [[Riderch I of Alt Clut|Rhydderch Hael]] and two other kings called Nudd Hael and Mordaf Hael to avenge him. They proceeded to raid and burn [[Cantref Arfon|Arfon]] until [[Rhun ap Maelgwn]] and the armies of Gwynedd forced them out.&lt;ref name="Bromwich491"/&gt;

Clydno's name also appears in lists of the [[Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain]]. According to these lists, Clydno possessed a magical [[halter]], the ''Cebystr Clydno Eiddin''. The explanatory note attached to later versions of the lists explain the halter's property: when he affixed it to a staple at the foot of his bed, he would find whatever horse he wished in it.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;Jones, Mary. [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/13.html "Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Prydain"]. From maryjones.us. Retrieved 16 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Clydno's son [[Cynon ap Clydno|Cynon]] was also a figure of Welsh tradition. The poem ''[[Y Gododdin]]'' names him as one of the Britons who fought against the [[Angles]] at the disastrous [[Battle of Catraeth]]; at one point the poem identifies him as the only survivor. Later works mention Cynon's great love for [[Morvydd]], daughter of [[Urien Rheged]], and he appears in the prose tale ''[[Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain]]'', taking the role given to [[Calogrenant]] in other versions of the story.

==Background==
Begley grew up in [[Wythenshawe]], Manchester, and moved to [[Gorton]], Manchester aged 17. After getting into trouble with police in his teens, he began working in an ice cream factory. His mother, Dorothy Begley, said her son "grew up overnight".&lt;ref name=men11jul/&gt; Dorothy Begley had previous called [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] on New Year's Eve 2011 because Jordan had become aggressive and threatened to harm others and himself; however, he later returned home without incident.&lt;ref name=gu2jun&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/02/police-taser-unlikely-to-have-caused-manchester-mans-death-inquest-hears|title=Police Taser unlikely to have caused Manchester man's death, inquest hears|date=2 June 2015|accessdate=25 July 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Nigel|last=Bunyan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A month before his death Begley had received tests for blackouts and intermittent chest pain.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; No abnormality was found, but doctors asked him to return for a more detailed test. Begley did not attend the appointment.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; Begley was a heavy drinker and used [[cocaine]].&lt;ref name=bbc2jul/&gt; At the time of his death he had intended to put down a deposit for a flat for himself, his girlfriend and her daughter.&lt;ref name=men11jul/&gt;

Figures published by the [[Home Office]] show that since the introduction of [[Taser]]s in 2003, their use had increased by more than 200 percent, that more than one in every ten officers carried a Taser, and that more than 10,000 Taser incidents had been recorded in England and Wales in 2013.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc6jul/&gt;

==Taser incident and death==
Dorothy Begley initially called police on the evening of 10 July 2013 as her son had become upset following an argument with neighbours and was threatening to take a knife outside, causing her to fear that there would be "a murder".&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; She did not tell Begley she had called the police.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt;

Armed [[Greater Manchester Police]] (GMP) officers rushed into Begley's dining room in Gorton.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; Eleven officers were deployed.&lt;ref name=bbc6jul/&gt; Begley was initially outside the house but agreed to go inside with the officers, and a standoff developed, which ended with [[Police Constable]] (PC) Terrence Donnelly drawing his [[Taser]] X26 and opening fire.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; Begley was immediately restrained when he offered minimal resistance.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt;

Begley was punched twice by PC Christopher Mills as other officers attempted to handcuff him.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; He was hit with "distraction strikes" and shot with a 50,000-volt [[Taser]] while he was handcuffed and restrained by three armed officers.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; The Taser shot lasted nine seconds&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; and was from a distance of 70 centimetres.&lt;ref name=bbc6jul/&gt; It was attributed by police to Donnelly having entered "a high state of alert."&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; The officers left Begley lying face-down with his hands cuffed behind his back.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt;

The inquest was later told that Donnelly had been made aware that Begley was potentially in possession of a knife. Donnelly said that Begley's hands were in his pockets, and that he asked him to show his hands to determine the whereabouts of a weapon, and to stop moving. According to Donnelly, Begley continued to approach him, after which he told him to stand still, then deployed the Taser.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; Dorothy Begley said her son had been "doing exactly what they wanted him to do" when the Taser was used.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt;

The inquest jury's verdict said that after Begley was forced to the floor the officers did not attempt to determine whether he was conscious, and ignored the fact that he did not cry out or speak.&lt;ref name=men6jul&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/devastated-mum-jordon-begley-hits-9600830|title= Devastated mum of Jordon Begley hits out after damning inquest rules police use of Taser was 'unreasonable'|date=6 July 2015|accessdate=25 July 2015|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|first=Chris|last=Osuh}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was turned over on to his back it became clear that he was in distress.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; Sergeant Andrew Wright said Begley had an "ashen" colour to his face and a "golf ball"-sized lump on his head when he was rolled over, and that his breathing was irregular.&lt;ref name=men16jun/&gt; Officers removed his handcuffs and attempted to revive him using a trauma kit, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] and a [[defibrillator]].&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt;

Begley died in [[Manchester Royal Infirmary]] at 10&amp;nbsp;pm on 10 July, around two hours after the incident, from a cardiac arrest.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; Begley was 23 at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; His funeral, which was paid for by the police, took place at Sacred Heart Church in Gorton on 17 September 2013.&lt;ref name=men11jul/&gt;

In August 2013 Dorothy Begley said she believed her son's death was due to a case of mistaken identity relating to a 25-year-old man from [[Sale, Greater Manchester]] also named Jordan Begley, who was on the run from prison. Begley said that on the night of her son's death an officer had questioned her about links to Sale. [[Assistant Chief Constable]] Dawn Copley said police were "not aware of any evidence to support that suggestion at this time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/taser-death-tragedy-police-mistake-5765152|title=Taser death tragedy: Did police mistake Jordan Begley for on-the-run prisoner?|date=22 August 2013|accessdate=25 July 2015|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|first=Richard|last=Wheatstone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-23793729|title=Jordan Begley Taser death 'not mistaken identity'|date=22 August 2013|accessdate=25 July 2015|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inquest and aftermath==
An [[inquest (England and Wales)|inquest]] was held at Manchester civil courts of justice over a period of five weeks in 2015.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt;

Lawyers for Donnelly and four other officers unsuccessfully sought a permanent [[anonymity order]], which would have prevented their being identified at the inquest.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; In February 2015 Manchester [[coroner]] Nigel Meadows refused the anonymity order, and named Donnelly, Mills, PC Peter Fox, PC Dave Graham and PC Andrew Wright as the officers who were present at the scene. Meadows said he had not been persuaded by arguments that the officers would face reprisals if their identities were publicised.&lt;ref name=bbc2feb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/five-officers-involved-jordan-begley-8565763|title=Named for the first time: Five police officers involved in Jordan Begley Taser death|date=2 February 2015|accessdate=25 July 2015|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|first=Richard|last=Wheatstone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donnelly, Fox, Graham, Mills and Wright, all serving GMP officers, gave evidence.&lt;ref name=bbc2jul/&gt; In June 2015 Wright denied colluding with other officers regarding his evidence.&lt;ref name=men16jun&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/police-sergeant-denies-colluding-fellow-9468101|title=Police sergeant denies colluding with fellow officers after Taser fired at tragic Jordan Begley|date=16 June 2015|accessdate=25 July 2015|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|first=Pat|last=Hurst}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical experts who gave evidence said the Taser was "unlikely" to have contributed to Begley's cardiac arrest.&lt;ref name=bbc2jul/&gt;&lt;ref name=gu2jun/&gt; The coroner said the inquest had "been a long case with a lot of evidence" which had been "different and inconsistent".&lt;ref name=bbc2jul/&gt; The jury retired on 2 July.&lt;ref name=bbc2jul&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-33364639|title=Jordon Begley: Taser death inquest jury retires|date=2 July 2015|accessdate=25 July 2015|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury concluded in a [[narrative verdict]] on 6 July that the use of the Taser did not directly cause Begley's heart to stop, but the restraint and the Taser "more than materially contributed" to a combination of stressful factors which triggered cardiac arrest.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; Other factors included Begley's alcoholism, his drug abuse, a dispute with neighbours, and the confrontation with police which followed.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; The jury also found that Donnelly had acted "inappropriately and unreasonably" in using the Taser for longer than was necessary.&lt;ref name=bbc6jul/&gt; and found that the two punches delivered as "distraction blows" by one officer were unnecessary.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; The verdict said "there was no need to punch twice without even checking his first response to the first punch."&lt;ref name=men6jul/&gt; The jury also found that the officers were "more concerned about their own welfare" than that of Begley.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc6jul/&gt;

The ruling marked the first time an inquest jury had found the use of a Taser to have contributed to a death.&lt;ref name=men11jul/&gt;

The [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) also conducted an investigation, which effectively exonerated the officers involved. As of July 2015 the IPCC had not published the results of its investigation.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; The result of the inquest caused the IPCC to review its investigation, and in August 2016 the IPCC won permission for a [[judicial review in English law|judicial review]] of its own report into Begley's death. This was the first time the IPCC had applied for a judicial review of an independent investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-36955309|title=Jordon Begley death: IPCC seeks to quash Taser death report|date=2 August 2016|accessdate=2 August 2016|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response===

Begley's family said after the outcome that they intended to sue the GMP.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; Dorothy Begley called for the immediate introduction of [[police body camera]]s and questioned why the officers involved had not been disciplined.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; She described the decision as "fantastic" and said "After two years of fighting everybody, fighting the system, Jordon's day has come. That is all I ever wanted. The last two years have been hell."&lt;ref name=bbc6jul/&gt; She also said her trust in the police had been "devastated and broken", and criticised the IPCC's report, which she said was "not worth the paper it's written on."&lt;ref name=men6jul/&gt; Dorothy Begley's lawyer, Mark McGhee, said the inquest's outcome would extent "far beyond the death of this one individual".&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt;

Ian Hanson, the chair of the GMP branch of the [[Police Federation of England and Wales]], emphasised the "dynamic" nature and short time-frame of the situation in which the Taser was used, and said "Unlike a jury, officers do not have five weeks to take decisions, and many of the [jury's] criticisms do not appear to us to reflect the reality and duration of this incident."&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt; Dawn Copley, the GMP's [[assistant chief constable]] said the verdict "raised a number of serious concerns, including the way the Taser was used, the use of force by the officers after the Taser was deployed and ... the communication between the officers who attended Jordon's home." Copley said the GMP would "examine the jury's findings in detail" and liaise with the IPCC and that she had restricted the duties of the officers involved.&lt;ref name=gu6jul/&gt;

In the wake of the verdict the [[National Police Chiefs' Council]] called for an independent body to examine the medical evidence and determine whether safety advice on Tasers should be changed in light of Begley's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/granada/update/2015-07-09/police-chiefs-call-for-taser-safety-review/|title=Police chiefs call for Taser safety review|date=9 July 2015|accessdate=25 July 2015|publisher=[[ITV News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/taser-safety-review-jordon-begley-9621680|title=Review into safety of Tasers ordered in wake of Jordon Begley inquest|date=9 July 2015|accessdate=25 July 2015|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|first=Chris|last=Slater}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-33464348|title=Jordon Begley: Taser review ordered after Manchester man's inquest|date=9 July 2015|accessdate=25 July 2015|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; GMP [[Chief Constable]] [[Peter Fahy]] defended the use of Tasers by police, and said the record of British police in terms of force was "remarkable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/granada/update/2015-07-09/chief-constable-fahey-defends-use-of-tasers/|title=Chief Constable Fahy defends police use of Tasers|date=9 July 2015|accessdate=25 July 2015|publisher=[[ITV News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]] is the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] term for deity; however, '''devata''' ([[Devanagari]]: देवता; [[Khmer language|Khmer]]: ទេវតា (''tevoda''); [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Balinese language|Balinese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''dewata''; [[Batak languages]]: ''debata'' [[Toba Batak language|(Toba)]], ''dibata'' [[Batak Karo language|(Karo)]], ''naibata'' [[Batak Simalungun language|(Simalungun)]]; [[Philippine languages]]: ''[[diwata]]'') is a smaller, more focused deva. The term "devata" can also mean deva (pl: devatas, meaning the gods). There are [[God and gender in Hinduism|male and female]] '''devatas'''. There are many kinds of devatas: vanadevatas (forest spirits, perhaps descendants of early nature-spirit cults), [[gramadevata]] (village gods), devatas of river crossings, caves, mountains, and so on. In Hinduism, the devatas that guard the eight, nine and ten cardinal points are called [[Lokapala]] ([[Guardians of the directions|Guardians of the Directions]]) or, more specifically in ancient [[Java]] tradition, ''Dewata Nawa Sanga'' ([[Surya Majapahit|Guardians of Nine Directions]]). Every human activity has its devata, its spiritual counterpart or aspect.

Hindu devatas in the [[Konkan]] region are often divided into five categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Folklore Notes, Vol. 2, Konkan|year=1915|publisher=British India Press, Mazgaon.|location=Bombay|author=R.E. Enthoven|author2=[[A. M. T. Jackson]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Gramadevata|Grama devatas]] or village deities, for example, [[Hanuman]], [[Kali|Kalika]], [[Durga|Amba]], [[Bhairava]].
# Sthana devatas or local deities, for example, those in certain places of pilgrimage like [[Rama]] in [[Nasik]], [[Vithoba]] in Pandharpur or [[Krishna]] at Dwarka.
# [[Kuladevata|Kula devatas]] or family deities, like Khanderai.
# [[Iṣṭa-devatā (Hinduism)|Ishta devatas]] or chosen deities
# Wastu devatas or Gruha devatas, a class of deities that preside over the house.

Some well-known Hindu-Buddhist heavenly beings belong to the group of devatas, such as [[apsara]] or [[Vidyadhara|vidhyadari]]; heavenly maiden sent by [[Indra]] from [[svarga]] to seduce the meditating [[ascetics]], and their male counterparts; [[gandharva]]s; the heavenly musicians. Devatas often occur in Hindu epics such as the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]], and also some Buddhist holy scriptures. The island of [[Bali]] is nicknamed ''Pulau Dewata'' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: "islands of devata or island of gods"), because of its vivid [[Hindu culture]] and traditions. In Bali, there are many offerings dedicated to [[hyang]], the guardian spirits associated with devata.

'''Ed "The Bull" Gantner''' (February 4, 1959 – December 31, 1990) was an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestler]].

==Early life==
'''Edward J. Gantner, Jr.''' was born and raised in Orlando, Florida, to Edward and Mary Lou Gantner. The youngest of four children, Ed was the only son with three older sisters. By the time he was three years old, his father would throw him the football hard enough to knock him down, only to get back up and throw it back. His mother and sisters never recall Gantner having a knack for football. He was considered a "puny little runt," all the way through junior high school.

Gantner's life began to change when he was around twelve years old, when his parents separated. His father moved out of the house, while his mother went back to school. His mother and sisters worked to keep the family afloat. He found solace in [[Olympic weightlifting|weight lifting]], pumping iron for hours alone in his room. He also found solace in [[surfing]].

==Football career==
Ed Gantner's major football career started at [[Edgewater High School]]. Around his junior year, he started using [[steroids]]. Between his junior and senior years in high school, he gained 45&amp;nbsp;lbs. His newly found physique gained him confidence to point, where he talked incessantly about the weight he gained, how much he could lift, and the size of his biceps and neck.

After graduating from high school, he got a college scholarship to play football for the [[University of Tennessee]], but after less than a year, he became depressed and homesick.

After returning home to Orlando, he took a hiatus, working as a bartender and a bouncer. In 1980, he returned to playing college football, this time for the [[University of Central Florida]], as a [[starting lineup|starter]]. He was also had the honor of being the first man from the college to go professional. He played pro football in the [[United States Football League]], where he played for the [[Tampa Bay Bandits]] for one year, and for the [[Jacksonville Bulls]] for two years.&lt;ref name=Schmadtke/&gt;

==Wrestling career==
Ed "The Bull" Gantner made his pro wrestling debut in 1985 in [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]]. Gantner started out as a heel, as a part of the House of Humperdink, led by [[Oliver Humperdink|Sir Oliver Humperdink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmitz|first=Brian|title=A PRO SHIFT: 'THE BULL' CHARGES INTO WRESTLING|newspaper=The Sentinel|date=July 19, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the group, he formed a tag team with [[Ray Candy|Kareem Muhammed]] called the '''Shock Troops'''. They made their debut on TV jumping [[The Fabulous Ones]] starting a program with them. They also unsuccessfully challenged [[The Road Warriors]] at [[Battle Of The Belts 3]] on September 3, 1986. He would also have a feud with [[Lex Luger]] that would go on for a good part of 1986.

In February 1987, Gantner was awarded the [[NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship]], after his manager Sir Oliver Humperdink defeated [[Allen Coage|Bad News Allen]] for the title. After losing the title to [[Mike Rotunda]] a month later, Gantner turn on Humperdink, turning him face. Gantner feuded with Humperdink's group with [[Barry Windham]], [[Blackjack Mulligan]], [[Bugsy McGraw]] and even [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] as his partner at different times. However, by July 1987, even with him in most of the major angles for Championship Wrestling from Florida, he abruptly retired from pro wrestling due to health issues.

==Retirement and death==
In 1988, Gantner's health began to go downhill after years of steroid use. His kidneys were the first to start failing, causing him to undergo kidney dialysis, forced him to be hooked up several hours a week to a machine to survive.

Doctors also forced Gantner to lose 100&amp;nbsp;lbs, as he nearly weighed 300&amp;nbsp;lbs. He complied by giving up red meat and starting a holistic diet, making his own watermelon tea. Despite the changes, he could not stop using steroids and had started using cocaine. He was rushed to the hospital for heart failure four times within two months. At that point, he started asking around for a firearm.

By the fall of 1989, his heart and kidneys were failing, after refusing doctors' orders to lose weight and alter his exercise regimen. On Thanksgiving Day, November 23, 1989, Gantner received a kidney transplant, as his sister donated her kidney. His family thought the worst was over. However, five days after the transplant, he asked that weights be brought to his room, as he went back to using steroids.

The strain of recovering from the transplant caused Gantner to lose weight, but he had still an imposing figure. Despite this, when he looked into a mirror, he saw a defective, distorted image. Self-conscious about his physique, he would wear shorts under his jeans to look bigger. While in the gym, he would wear an extra pair of socks to bulk up his calves. Over the next six months, he would go back to the hospital five times, because of complications. He would also move from Orlando, to [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], to [[West Palm Beach]], working as a [[salesman]].

Early in the fall of 1990, Gantner's mental health began to falter, as he started calling his parents late at night. He would get dressed for work, make it to his car, and sit there for a half-hour with the keys in the ignition, before going back in his house. When his mother finally decided to bring him home in Orlando, she found him in a dark room, sitting down, rocking on his bed.

Back home with his parents in Orlando, Gantner would not eat, sleep, or work out. He would shower constantly and pace all night long. When his mother tried to take him for a haircut, he made her drive all over town, and at each stop, he refused to leave the car.

By November 1990, Gantner was placed in a psychiatric ward at a Florida hospital, where he stayed until after Christmas. During this time, he began casting about for solutions and new truths—meditation, vitamins, even faith healing with Rev. [[Benny Hinn]].

Feeling defeated, on New Year's Eve, December 31, 1990, Ed Gantner committed suicide by shooting himself in the heart in the kitchen of his parents' home in Orlando, Florida. He was 31 years old.&lt;ref name=Schmadtke&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmadtke|first=Alan|title=THE BULL' GANTER DIES AT AGE 31|newspaper=The Sentinel|date=January 4, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evan Eckenrode''' (born February 11, 1997) is an American [[comedian]], [[filmmaker]], [[internet personality]] and former [[Vine (service)|Vine]] star. Eckenrode is best known for his work on [[Vine (service)|Vine]], and on the video platform [[YouTube]]. His other projects included collaborations with his roommate [[Logan Paul]].

Eckenrode began filming [[Vine (service)|Vine]] videos in his hometown of [[Smithsburg, Maryland]] with his high school friends, most of which lightheartedly emphasized his dwarfism. By the time [[Vine]] shutdown, Eckenrode amassed a following of over two millions viewers. His YouTube account, DwarfMamba, recently achieved the same number of subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UC1bMs87K1YPMcs8Wb5L0ndw/realtime |title=Real Time YouTube Subscriber Count |author=SocialBlade |publisher=SocialBlade |accessdate=February 27, 2018|date=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Farrell Till''' (April 26, 1933 – October 3, 2012) was the editor of the formerly published ''The Skeptical Review'' and was a prominent debater against [[Christianity]] and [[biblical inerrancy]]. He published critical articles of the inerrancy subject as well as skeptical examinations of other biblical interpretations.

Till held a B.A. English and M.A. English from [[Harding University]]. He was a member of [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], the [[National Center for Science Education]], and the [[Council for Secular Humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://infidels.org/library/modern/farrell_till/till-bio.html "Brief Biography of Farrell Till"]. Internet Infidels. Retrieved 2017-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Till was a [[Church of Christ]] minister and missionary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theskepticalreview.com/AuthorFarrellTill.html  | title=A Long Day's Journey Into Light | publisher= The Skeptical Review |year= 2012 | first= | last= | accessdate =2015-02-18 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120205175352/http://www.theskepticalreview.com/AuthorFarrellTill.html | archivedate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; but left the church in 1963 and later became an [[atheist]]. In addition to having edited ''The Skeptical Review,'' Till ran the "Errancy" list, which discusses biblical contradictions and errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://iierrancy.com/  | title=Entire Errancy archive | publisher= The Skeptical Review |year= 2012 | first= | last= | accessdate =2015-02-18 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140517095857/http://iierrancy.com/ | archivedate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He formally and informally debated with numerous Christian thinkers and evangelists, including philosophical apologist [[Norman Geisler]] and [[Young Earth creationism]] advocate [[Kent Hovind]].

[[File:Bust to Felice Cavallotti in Como.jpg|thumb|Bust to Felice Cavallotti in Como]]
'''Felice Cavallotti''' (6 November 1842 – 6 March 1898) was an [[Italy|Italian]] politician, poet and dramatic author.

==Biography==

=== Early career ===
Born in [[Milan]], Cavallotti fought with the [[Hunters of the Alps|Garibaldian Corps]] in their 1860 and 1866 campaigns during the [[Italian unification|Italian Wars of Independence]].

Following his military service he created a series of anti-monarchical lampoons in the ''[[Gazzetta di Milano]]'' and in  the ''[[Gazzettina Rosa]]'' between 1866 and 1872.  He also commented Garibaldi's deeds in the Neapolitan ''Indipendente'', directed by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]].

=== Political career ===
In 1872 Cavallotti was elected to the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]] as deputy for [[Corteolona]]. When sworn in Cavallotti took the oath of allegiance, despite having lampooned the oath in his articles. Eloquent and turbulent, his combativeness in and out of Parliament secured for him the leadership of the extreme Left on the death of [[Agostino Bertani]] in 1886.

During his twelve years' leadership his party increased in number
from twenty to seventy, and at the time of his death his parliamentary influence was greater than ever before.

Although he was ambitious and used defamatory methods of personal attack, Cavallotti's eloquent advocacy of democratic reform and apparent generosity of sentiment secured for him a popularity surpassed by that of no Italian political contemporary save [[Francesco Crispi]].

Services rendered in the [[cholera]] epidemic of 1885, his numerous lawsuits and thirty-three [[duel]]s, his bitter campaign against Crispi, and his championship of [[France|French]] interests combined to enhance his notoriety and to increase his political influence.

By skillful alliances with the Marquis [[Antonio di Rudinì]] he more than once obtained practical control of the Italian government and exacted notable concessions to Radical demands.

In 1889 he contributed to the erection of the statue of [[Giordano Bruno]] in [[Campo de' Fiori]] at [[Rome]], a symbol of the lay struggle against the unceasing encroachment of the [[Holy See]] in the Italian politics.

=== Death===
Aged 55, Cavallotti was killed in a duel with Count [[Ferruccio Macola]], editor of the conservative ''[[Gazzetta di Venezia]]'', whom he had insulted.&lt;ref name=nyt070398&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1898/03/07/102086820.pdf Roman Duel Ends Fatally; Signor Cavallotti, the Poet and Radical, Killed by the Sword of Signor Macola], The New York Times, March 7, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;  Poet [[Giosuè Carducci]] issued a celebrative discourse for his death. Cavallotti was buried in the cemetery of Dagnente, on the [[Lake Maggiore]].

'''François Isaac de Rivaz''' ([[Paris]], December 19, 1752 &amp;ndash; [[Sion, Switzerland|Sion]], July 30, 1828) was an [[inventor]] and a politician. He invented a hydrogen-powered [[internal combustion engine]] with electric ignition and described it in a French patent published in 1807. In 1808 he fitted it into a primitive working vehicle – "the world's first internal combustion powered automobile".&lt;ref name=e/&gt;

== Biography ==
Isaac was born in Paris to a family from [[Valais]]. In 1763 the family settled in [[Moûtiers]] in [[Savoy]] ([[Kingdom of Sardinia]]). The last two boys, Anne Joseph and Isaac, came to settle in [[Saint-Gingolph, Switzerland|St. Gingolph in Valais]]. It is not known at which schools he studied, but he became fluent in [[Latin]] plus mastering [[mathematics]] and [[geometry]], whilst continuing his study of [[mechanics]] throughout his life. He qualified as both a [[surveying|surveyor]] and [[notary]] and worked for the state of Valais.&lt;ref name='Michelet'/&gt;

Isaac had many interests plus an intuitive and extremely curious mind which was driven by the ''demon of discovery''. His experimental work was overflowing. He experimented with [[History of steam road vehicles|steam-powered vehicles]] in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name='Michelet'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Michelet | first1 = Henri | title = L'inventeur Isaac de Rivaz: 1752 - 1828 | publisher = Editions Saint-Augustin | year = 1965| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Wf-nrnUaZxAC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Fran%C3%A7ois+Isaac+de+Rivaz#v=onepage&amp;q=1807&amp;f=false|accessdate = 2011-05-28}} In French&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied the ignition of combustible gases.&lt;ref name='Michelet'/&gt;

== Internal combustion engine ==
{{Main article|de Rivaz engine}}

After retirement from the Army, living in Switzerland, he invented a primitive [[internal combustion engine]] which he constructed in 1807.&lt;ref name=e&gt;{{cite book|last=Eckermann|first=Erik|title=World History of the Automobile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLZeQwqNmdgC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22François+Isaac+de+Rivaz%22&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers|location=Warrendale, PA|year=2001|isbn=0-7680-0800-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen manually ignited by electric spark, but the engine neither involved the in-cylinder compression, the [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]], nor the [[connecting rod]].&lt;ref name=e/&gt; A year later, Isaac built an early [[automobile]] for his new engine to power.&lt;ref name=e/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;About.com: Inventors: [http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aacarsgasa.htm The History of the Automobile - The Internal Combustion Engine and Early Gas-Powered Cars]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US7137366"&gt;{{Cite patent|US|7137366}} Page 10: '': In the early nineteenth century, Francois Isaac de Rivaz of Switzerland invented a hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine.''&lt;/ref&gt; His engine was never commercially successful.{{clarify|date=May 2011|reason=But did it at least influence Lenoir, Roches, Otto or Dugald Clerk?}}

== Alternative claims for internal combustion engines ==

Coincidentally, in 1807 [[Nicéphore Niépce]] installed his 'moss, coal-dust and resin'-fueled [[Pyréolophore]] internal combustion engine in a boat and powered up the river [[Saone]] in France to be granted a patent by the [[Emperor of the French|Emperor]] [[Napoleon I|Napoleon Bonaparte]]. The discrete, virtually simultaneous, implementations of these two designs of internal combustion in different modes of transport means that the de Rivaz engine can be correctly described as "the worlds first use of an internal combustion engine in an auto-mobile (in 1808)", whilst the "Pyréolophore (in 1807) was the world's first use of an internal combustion engine in a ship".{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Although de Rivaz's early work is credited as the first use of the internal combustion engine in an automobile, the further development and mass production of the invention never truly began until the late nineteenth century.

In 1824, the French physicist [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot]] scientifically established the [[thermodynamic]] theory of idealized [[heat engine]]s. This highlighted{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} the shortcoming of these pioneering designs, whereby they needed a compression mechanism to increase the difference between the upper and lower working temperatures and potentially unlock sufficient power and efficiency. [[Gasoline]] was not used for internal combustion engines until 1870 when [[carburetor]]s were invented to convert non-combustible liquid fuels into a combustible gaseous mixture form.

'''Harry James Watson "Jimmy" Belvin''' (1900 -1986) was an educator and served as an [[Oklahoma]] State Representative and Senator. He was the first elected principal chief of any of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] in the 20th century, and the longest serving principal chief of the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]]. He saw his tribe through termination, restoration, and a rebirth of Native Pride. He was a polarizing leader, seen by some as a semi-dictator who held onto the office of principal chief and used his power to advocate for complete assimilation into the dominant society, suppressing Choctaw traditions, language and ceremonial practices as undesirable remnants of an unrefined history.&lt;ref name="Akers (2013)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akers|first1=Donna L.|title=Culture and customs of the Choctaw indians|date=2013|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=978-0-313-36401-3|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XeDeGlxgASUC&amp;lpg|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To others, he was a well-liked, populist leader, who went door-to-door talking with tribe members, informing them on issues, and trying to develop the means the alleviate the poverty and unemployment they faced.&lt;ref name="Lambert AIQ Vol. 31" /&gt;

After his first successful election to the Oklahoma legislature in 1955, Belvin served three terms in the Oklahoma State House of Representatives representing Bryan County. In 1960, he was elected as an Oklahoma State Senator.&lt;ref name="Miami (1961)" /&gt;

==Coal and Asphalt Lands==
As early as 1946, support for Belvin becoming principal chief had been growing.&lt;ref name="Chickasaw Nation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jimmy Belvin and the Rise of Tribal Sovereignty, 1944-48|url=https://www.chickasaw.net/Our-Nation/History/Historical-Articles/History/Indian-Territory/Jimmy-Belvin-and-the-Rise-of-Tribal-Sovereignty,-1.aspx|publisher=The Chickasaw Nation|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William A. Durant]] had served since 1937,&lt;ref name="Chief Durant"&gt;{{cite web|title=William Durant 1937 - 1948|url=http://www.choctawnation.com/history/people/chiefs/1937---william-durant/|publisher=Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|accessdate=6 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128113610/http://www.choctawnation.com/history/people/chiefs/1937---william-durant/#|archive-date=2015-01-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was seen as having made little headway on selling the asphalt lands of the Choctaw and Chickasaw. At issue were some {{convert|400000|acres|km2}} of lands that were jointly owned by the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes. Based on a 1902 agreement, the US had agreed to purchase these lands within three years, but had still not done so. In 1946, Chief Durant and Chickasaw Governor [[Floyd Maytubby]] were asking for $33.1 million which the US government valued at $2.2 million. Belvin was, on the other hand was seen as an educated, galvanized leader who wanted to revitalize the tribe. Even before he was chief, he wrote long letters to Congressman [[Carl Albert]], Congressman [[William Stigler]], Senator [[Elmer Thomas]], Senator [[Edward H. Moore]], the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] office, and the Superintendent of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] criticizing the delays in finalizing the purchase.&lt;ref name="Chickasaw Nation" /&gt;

When a settlement was finally reached of $8.5 million, Belvin again launched a letter-writing campaign questioning why the settlement was reached without allowing representatives of the Choctaw-Chickasaw Confederation to attend the negotiations.&lt;ref name="Chickasaw Nation" /&gt;  Considering that the land contained 770 million tons of readily available coal, another 1 billion tons of reserve coal and asphalt, and was near a recent oil strike,&lt;ref name="Truman"&gt;{{cite web|title=President Truman receives prominent Oklahoma Native American leaders in the Oval Office|url=http://www.historyinink.com/1317001_Truman_SP_with_Indian_leaders.htm|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belvin questioned how the coal could be valued at 1 cent per ton and the reserve coal, valued at 0.1 cent per ton.&lt;ref name="Chickasaw Nation"/&gt; Belvin was also highly critical of the fact that Chief Durant had not attended the negotiations, leaving the decision of "the most momentous meeting affecting the tribe's welfare since the [[Atoka Agreement]] of 1897" up to Maytubby and the Choctaw Tribal attorney.&lt;ref name= "Truman"/&gt;

Choctaw-Chickasaw Confederation was officially created on 9 January 1947,&lt;ref name="C-C Confederation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Choctaw Chickasaw Confederation|url=http://oklahomafirms.us/choctaw-chickasaw-confederation.106999.company#top_info|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it had operated for several years, as a means for the tribes to track tribal assets, hold meetings and discussions and disseminate information outside of the "official" BIA structure.&lt;ref name=Ardmoreite&gt;{{cite news|title=Indians to Hold Meet at Antlers|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/oklahoma/ardmore/ardmore-daily-ardmoreite/1947/08-27/page-7|accessdate=10 January 2015|publisher=Ardmore Daily Ardmoreite|date=27 August 1947|location=Ardmore, Oklahoma|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sale had been negotiated, Belvin wrote letters as president of the Confederation to tribal members and urged them to attend informational meetings and decide whether or not they wanted to accept the offer. He did not give his own opinions, but urged each tribemember to vote according to their own conscience.&lt;ref name="Indian Friend"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dear Indian Friend Letter|url=http://digital.libraries.ou.edu/utils/getfile/collection/gmccurtain/id/539/filename/540.pdf|website=University of Oklahoma|accessdate=10 January 2015|date=7 November 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he thought the settlement amount was undervalued, once he became chief, Belvin stopped criticizing the amount and strove to collect the distribution so desperately needed by his poverty stricken tribe members.&lt;ref name="Chickasaw Nation" /&gt;

==Choctaw Principal Chief==
Belvin was first elected as Principal Chief of the Choctaw Nation in 1948.&lt;ref name="Paris News (1948)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Belvin Reported Vote Leader In Race for Choctaw Chief|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/14096657/|accessdate=10 January 2015|publisher=The Paris News|date=27 June 1948|location=Paris, Texas|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="10 Nov. 1954 BIA letter"&gt;{{cite web|title=Belvin Appointed Principal Chief of Oklahoma Choctaws|url=http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc016228.pdf|publisher=Department of the Interior|accessdate=7 January 2015|date=10 November 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he was the first elected chief of any of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] and of the Choctaw Nation in the 20th century. All chiefs of the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma since the implementation of the [[Dawes Act]] had been appointed by the president upon recommendation from the BIA. Until the 1970s, the only two exceptions to presidential appointment were that in 1948 and again in 1954, the Choctaw were allowed to elect their chief. Both times, they elected Belvin,&lt;ref name="Lambert 2007, p 66"&gt;Lambert (2007), p 66&lt;/ref&gt; though voting was limited to a fraction of the eligible enrollees.&lt;ref name= "Civ-05-01524-W"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE CHICKASAW NATION and THE CHOCTAW NATION v.

In the lead up to the 1954 election, the Department of the Interior informed Belvin that they did not believe the tribe warranted a full-time chief. Belvin contacted Congressman Carl Albert, also a proponent of tribal democracy, who worked behind the scenes to keep the Choctaw Principal Chief as a full-time position. Belvin believed so strongly in the right of the tribes to elect their own governance, that he persuaded the Chickasaw to press for their own elections.&lt;ref name="Chickasaw Times"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic 1959 Tribal Meeting at Ada's Aldridge Hotel|url=http://digital.turn-page.com/i/24128/34|website=Chickasaw Times|accessdate=8 January 2015|page=35|date=September 2007}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Chickasaw tried for many years to convince the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] to allow them to vote on their own leadership, their requests were ignored.&lt;ref name=Civ-05-01524-W /&gt;

===Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes===
There had been several joint relationships among the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] throughout their history—the 1842 Inter-Tribal Council of the Deep Fork River, the 1861 United Nations of Indian Territory, and the 1866 Okmulgee Council.&lt;ref name="Intertribal Council"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/I/IN033.html|website=digital.library.okstate|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of their similar histories and situations in Oklahoma, with removal, allotment, and government oversight, there was a recognition that tribal goals for development, education, services for tribe members, health initiatives and poverty alleviation were virtually the same and working together would be of benefit.&lt;ref name="ITC History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Section One: Preserving Indian Heritage|url=http://www.fivecivilizedtribes.org/Home/History/ChapterFive.aspx|website=ITC 5 Civilized Tribes|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, informally the tribes had already been working jointly on projects. In March, 1949, Belvin had gone to [[Washington, DC]] not only to prod lawmakers regarding the coal and asphalt settlement, but to present a proposal drawn up by representatives of the five tribes as a far-reaching "relief" plan. They proposed more effective administration of Indian affairs, a new land policy, rehabilitation, education, health, conservation, and road building and maintenance as the means to alleviate distress in their nations and had obtained the endorsement from the local agency office.&lt;ref name="ITC - Ardmore 1949"&gt;{{cite news|title=Belvin Home From Washington: Reports on Indian Situation|url=http://www.myheritage.es/research/collection-10025/archivo-de-periodicos?itemId=594520081&amp;action=showRecord|accessdate=11 January 2015|agency=Ardmore Daily Ardmoreite|date=23 March 1949|location=Ardmore, Oklahoma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September and October 1949, the leaders of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] met in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]] and formed the Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes (ITC). They pledged to work together to attain for themselves and their descendants the rights and benefits which they were entitled to under law, state or federal, and to seek equity for tribal affairs and tribe members by promoting the common welfare of American Indians. The constitution of the organization was approved on February 3, 1950. Inter-Tribal Council membership includes the principal chief and four members from each of the [[Cherokee Nation|Cherokee]], [[Chickasaw Nation|Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw Nation|Choctaw]], [[Creek Nation|Creek]] and [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma|Seminole]] nations.&lt;ref name="Intertribal Council" /&gt;

Belvin served on the ITC from its founding in 1949 through 1975.&lt;ref name="ITC History" /&gt; After obtaining Congressional approval, and pressing for the withdrawal of [[House concurrent resolution 108|House Concurrent Resolution 108]], the ITC has spent over a half-century of activity focusing on education, health care, housing, and sovereignty to serve the special cultural, economic, and social needs of all tribespeople.&lt;ref name="Intertribal Council" /&gt;

===Termination===
As part of the [[Indian termination policy]] pursued by the US government from the 1940s through the 1960s, a series of laws were passed to enable the government to end its trust relationships with native tribes. One of the first of these laws passed on August 13, 1946—the [[Indian Claims Commission]] Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-726, ch. 959. Its purpose was to settle for all time any outstanding grievances or claims the tribes might have against the U.S. for treaty breaches, unauthorized taking of land, dishonorable or unfair dealings, or inadequate compensation. Claims had to be filed within a five-year period, and most of the 370 complaints that were submitted were filed at the approach of the 5-year deadline in August, 1951.&lt;ref name="Philip (1999)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Philp|first1=Kenneth R.|title=Termination revisited : American Indians on the trail to self-determination, 1933-1953|date=1999|publisher=Univ. of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln [u.a.]|isbn=0-8032-3723-5|pages=21–33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68ggiC4QtRkC&amp;lpg|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, the government had appropriated funds for the tribal sale of coal and asphalt resources, but had charged almost 10% of the $8.5 million award in administrative fees.&lt;ref name="Kidwell (2002)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kidwell|first1=Clara Sue|title=The Resurgence of the Choctaws in the Twentieth Century|journal=Indigenous Nations Studies Journal|volume= . 3, No. 1|issue=Spring 2002|pages=10–12|url=http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/handle/1808/5782/ins.v03.n1.3-18.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Belvin became chief in 1948, he realized that only federally recognized tribes were allowed to file a claim with the Commission. If he wanted to get that money back, his tribe needed to reorganize. He created a democratically elected tribal council and a constitution to re-establish a government, but his efforts were opposed by the Area Director of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. Ultimately, the tribe was able to file a claim for around $750,000 with the Commission in 1951 on a  technicality. The suit was classified as a renewal of the 1944 case against the US Court of Claims, but that did not stop the antagonism between Belvin and the area BIA officials.&lt;ref name="Kidwell (2002)" /&gt; The BIA had had management issues for decades. Poorly trained personnel, inefficiency, corruption, and lack of consistent policy plagued the organization almost from its founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downsizinggovernment.org/interior/indian-lands-indian-subsidies|title=Indian Lands, Indian Subsidies,|work=Downsizing the Federal Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Belvin, relief from BIA oversight of policies and funds seemed as if it might pave the way for the Choctaw to maintain their own traditional ways of operating and reform their own governing council.&lt;ref name="Kidwell (2002)" /&gt;

Early on, it may also be that Belvin believed termination was what the tribe wanted. In a 1954 presentation to the [[Five Civilized Tribes|Intertribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes]], he told the chiefs of the [[Cherokee Nation|Cherokee]], [[Chickasaw Nation|Chickasaw]], [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation|Creek]] and [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma|Seminole]] nations that the majority of [[Choctaw Nation|Choctaw]] were not interested in tribal affairs and supported discontinuance of the tribe.&lt;ref name="Lambert 2007, p 66"/&gt; But, he also stated in an interview that same year with the ''Lubbock Avalanche,'' that he thought proposing termination was another way for the government to "shirk its responsibility to a people who owned the entire continent of North America when the white man first invaded, not discovered, this country".&lt;ref name="Lubbock (1954)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Considine|first1=Bob|title=Bill Would Be a Blow to Redmen: U.S. Continues War on Indian Tribes with Legislative Bullet|url=http://www.myheritage.es/research/collection-10025/archivo-de-periodicos?itemId=688307153&amp;action=showRecord|accessdate=11 January 2015|publisher=Lubbock Morning Avalanche|date=31 March 1954|location=Lubbock, Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After eleven years as Choctaw chief, Belvin persuaded Representative [[Carl Albert]] of Oklahoma to introduce federal legislation to begin terminating the Choctaw tribe.&lt;ref name="Kidwell (2002)" /&gt; What Belvin proposed was relief from the paternalistic watch of the BIA, which allowed the tribe to choose their own chiefs and handle tribal business and assets without federal supervision.&lt;ref name="Brownwood (1970)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Godfrey|title=Indians Ready Peace Pipe -- Repeal Bill Due Senate Action|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/6741102/|accessdate=9 January 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Brownwood Bulletin|date=August 19, 1970|location=Brownwood, Texas|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 April 1959, the BIA confirmed that H.R.2722, had been submitted to Congress at the request of the tribe, and would sell all remaining tribal assets, but would not effect any individual Choctaw earnings. It also provided for retention of 1/2 of all mineral rights which could be managed by a tribal corporation.&lt;ref name="BIA - 23 April 1959"&gt;{{cite web|title=Department Supports Choctaw Termination Bill Introduced in Congress at the Request of Tribal Representatives|url=http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc016731.pdf|publisher=Department of the Interior|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 August 1959, Congress passed a bill&lt;ref name="Public Law 86-192"&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Law 86-192|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol6/html_files/v6p0882.html|publisher=US Code|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to terminate the tribe, which was later called ''Belvin's law,'' as he was the main advocate behind it. Belvin created overwhelming support for termination among tribespeople through his promotion of the bill, describing the process and expected outcomes.&lt;ref name="Lambert AIQ Vol. 31" /&gt; What Belvin envisioned was that the high unemployment and poverty which existed in the nation, would be offset by the per capita payment that tribe members would receive from liquidation of the tribal assets.&lt;ref name="Lambert 2007, p 66"/&gt; Tribal members later interviewed said that Belvin never used the word "termination" for what he was describing, and many people were unaware he was proposing termination.&lt;ref name="Lambert AIQ Vol. 31"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lambert|first1=Valerie|title=Political Protest, Conflict, and Tribal Nationalism: The Oklahoma Choctaws and the Termination Crisis of 1959–1970|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume= 31, No. 2|issue=Spring 2007|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4138948?sid=21105014084301&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3738664&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|doi=10.2307/4138948}}&lt;/ref&gt; In actuality, the provisions of the bill were intended to be a final disposition of all trust obligations and a final "dissolution of the tribal governments."&lt;ref name="BIA - 23 April 1959"/&gt; Belvin claimed that he was misled and that the BIA did not pass the legislation the Choctaw proposed, as it did affect individual Choctaws and the relationships they had with the government and programs.&lt;ref name="Ardmore (1970)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Washington (AP)|url=http://www.myheritage.es/research/collection-10025/archivo-de-periodicos?itemId=594424183&amp;action=showRecord|accessdate=11 January 2015|publisher=Ardmore Daily Ardmoreite|date=15 July 1970|location=Ardmore, Oklahoma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Act was to have expired in 1962, but was amended twice to allow more time to sell the tribal assets. As time wore on, Belvin realized that the bill severed the tribe members' access to government loans and other services, including the tribal tax exemption. By 1967, he had asked Oklahoma Congressman [[Ed Edmondson (politician)|Ed Edmondson]] to try to repeal the termination act.&lt;ref name="Kidwell (2002)" /&gt; Belvin's views were not just contained in private letters. In a 1967 newspaper account, he stated that the tribe needed to determine whether to outright repeal the 1959 Choctaw Termination Act or whether they wanted to form a tribal corporation to manage tribal affairs without supervision of the federal government.&lt;ref name="Ada News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chief J.W. Harry Belvin said!|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/oklahoma/ada/ada-evening-news/1967/03-31/page-3|accessdate=7 January 2015|publisher=Ada Evening News|date=March 31, 1967|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, both Oklahomans, House Majority Leader [[Carl Albert]] and Senator [[Fred R. Harris]], as well as [[Louis R. Bruce]], Commissioner of Indian Affairs, were in support of the Choctaw request to kill the bill.&lt;ref name="Ardmore (1970)" /&gt;

By the late 1960s public sentiment was changing as well. The Choctaw people had seen what termination could do to tribes, since they witnessed the process with four other tribes in Oklahoma: the [[Wyandotte Nation]], [[Peoria tribe|Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma]], [[Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma]], and [[Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma]].  In 1969, ten years after passage of the Choctaw termination bill and one year before the Choctaws were to be terminated, word spread throughout the tribe that Belvin's law was a termination bill. The [[Choctaw Youth Movement]] fought politically against the termination law and helped create a new sense of tribal pride, especially among younger generations. Congress finally repealed the law on  August 24, 1970.&lt;ref name="Lambert AIQ Vol. 31" /&gt;

===Choctaw Youth Movement===
{{main|Choctaw Youth Movement}}
In 1969, one year before the termination bill was scheduled to go into effect (officially 25 August 1970) Jim Wade, son of Talihina's police chief, told [[Charles E. Brown (Choctaw)|Charles E. Brown]], that the government was dissolving the Choctaw tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (2007), pp 64-65&lt;/ref&gt; Alarmed, and believing that most Choctaw did not realize "Belvin's law" was a termination bill rather than a per capita payment bill, Brown began organizing other urban Choctaw, primarily in the Oklahoma City area. With a key group of organizers they began using kin networks to contact Choctaw relatives throughout the country and traditional Choctaw Nation to urge them to fight against termination and be proud of their Choctaw heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (2007), pp 66-70&lt;/ref&gt; They printed a newsletter called ''Hello Choctaws''&lt;ref name="Kidwell (2007)"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Kidwell|first1=Clara Sue ; foreword by Lindsay G.

It is equally clear that Belvin felt that activists were personally attacking him and that he scheduled meetings throughout the Choctaw Nation to justify his actions.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (2007), pp 73-75&lt;/ref&gt;

It is hard to judge the effectiveness of the Choctaw Youth Movement in actually overturning the termination legislation.  Public sentiment was changing with the passage of the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968]],&lt;ref name="Wunder (1996)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wunder|first1=edited with introductions by John R.|title=The Indian Bill of Rights, 1968|date=1996|publisher=Garland Pub.|location=New York|isbn=0-8153-2487-1|pages=78–81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xRR2B2q5wxkC&amp;lpg|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court ruling in the [[Menominee Tribe v.

Activists saw the BIA appointment of their leadership as an infringement on their identity as a sovereign people.&lt;ref name="Kidwell (2007)" /&gt;

Where Belvin and youth activists differed was that Belvin seemed to see the tribe as a simple corporate entity whose role was to manage tribal assets. Activists saw the tribe as a multifaceted organization which spurred community development and fostered Choctaw identity.&lt;ref&gt;Kidwell (2007), p 213&lt;/ref&gt; What the movement did in unequivocal terms was foster pride in being Choctaw and brought about a rebirth in Choctaw nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (2007), p 72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Education===
As a teacher and educator, Belvin had on ongoing interest in furthering education for Native Americans. He participated in the 1956 [[American Indian Institute]] Conference at the [[University of Oklahoma]] and urged that education had to include teaching underprivileged Indians the skills necessary to earn a living. He acknowledged that while education would bring about economic change, for Indians to progress they "could not neglect the culture and heritage" that they had contributed to the country. Belvin agreed to serve on the Institute's planning committee for the following year.&lt;ref name="American Indian Institute"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Indian Institute|url=http://digital.libraries.ou.edu/whc/nam/manuscripts/Campbell_WS_119_11.pdf|publisher=Western History Collections, University of Oklahoma|accessdate=10 January 2015|location=Norman, Oklahoma|pages=12–13|date=17 March 1956|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723125722/http://digital.libraries.ou.edu/whc/nam/manuscripts/Campbell_WS_119_11.pdf#|archive-date=2010-07-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, a dispute among the Mississippi Choctaw found Belvin encouraging support for a Choctaw high school in Mississippi. Victor Kaneubbe, a worker at a Baptist mission in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]] was an Oklahoma Choctaw with a white wife and a mixed-blood daughter, who was unable to attend either the agency schools or white schools in Mississippi.  Choctaw administrators refused to allow his daughter admittance and the Neshoba County School Board refused admittance as well. He brought the issue of racism to the fore and urged his missionary network to petition Congress for creation of a Choctaw high school. The adverse publicity enraged the Baptist community, and cost Kaneubbe his job, forcing him to transfer to the Navajo reservation. Kaneubbe left but the problem of inadequate education remained for eastern Choctaw.  Appeals to the BIA resulted in responses that students could attend out of state boarding schools, thus squarely putting pressure on the eastern Choctaw to relocate or face lack of educational opportunity. Agitation from the [[National Congress of American Indians]], the [[Mississippi Federation of Women's Clubs]], Oklahoma Choctaw Chief Belvin, and other civil rights activists forced Mississippi's congressional delegation to request a high school and dormitory for the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]], though it took several more years of negotiation to make the high school become a reality.&lt;ref name="Osburn (2014)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osburn|first1=Katherine M. B.|title=Choctaw resurgence in Mississippi : race, class, and nation building in the jim crow south, 1830-1977|date=2014|publisher=University of Nebraska|isbn=978-0-8032-4044-5|pages=192–197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCeXAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belvin was acutely aware that his generation had been urged to learn [[English language|English]] and not [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]], but claims that his father's  encouragement to speak only English had caused Belvin to advocate for full assimilation and favor eliminating the study of Choctaw,&lt;ref name="Akers (2013)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (2007), p 85&lt;/ref&gt; are not born out by his work in education. Belvin remained involved with his alma mater, Southeastern State College (now [[Southeastern Oklahoma State University]]) in Durant. Around 1969, with Belvin and other educators' full support and input, the college began a Bilingual Education Program, which was sponsored by a grant from the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] National Institute of Education. The program targeted four elementary schools in the heart of Choctaw country, [[Battiest, Oklahoma|Battiest]], [[Broken Bow, Oklahoma|Broken Bow]], [[Smithville, Oklahoma|Smithville]] and [[Wright City, Oklahoma|Wright City]] in McCurtain County, Oklahoma. The program, as designed had 3 principal goals, all aimed at mainstreaming the student without sacrificing his/her native identity:

* Students should have positive image reinforcement both inside and outside of the classroom;
* [[Choctaw language]] must be accepted to be the basis for learning as the student develops a facility with English which will supplement learning;
* Teachers and classroom attendants must understand Choctaw language, thought patterns and behavior and accept those as equal to their English counterparts.&lt;ref name="Choctaw Bilingual Program"&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Bowen|editor1-first=Collin W.|title=Choctaw Bilingual Education Program: Distinguished Achievement Awards Entry|journal=Education Resources Information Center (ERIC)|date=19 November 1973|pages=1–4|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED085363.pdf|accessdate=12 January 2015|publisher=Southeastern State College|location=Durant, Oklahoma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program continued until around 1982, when federal funding initiatives were cut.&lt;ref name="Southeastern (1982)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lokey|first1=Ray|title=Choctaw Bilingual Center May Fade to History|url=http://carmine.se.edu/digitized-annuals/The%20Southeastern/Newspapers/1982/3%20-%20March/March%2011,%201982.pdf|accessdate=12 January 2015|issue=Volume 60; Number 26|publisher=Soulheastem Oklahoma Stale University|date=11 March 1982|location=Durant, Oklahoma|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Health===
In 1955, the Indian Health Service was transferred from the administration of the BIA to the [[Public Health Service]], which resulted in an almost immediate improvement in funding, training and services.&lt;ref name="Sturtevant (1988)"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sturtevant|editor1-first=William C.|title=Handbook of North American Indians: History of Indian-White relations, Vol. 4|date=1988|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|isbn=0-16-004583-5|lccn=77017162|pages=77–78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQRpEgEzYd4C&amp;lpg|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the Talihina Indian Hospital (now known as the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma#Health System|Choctaw Nation Health Care Center]]) was designated as the Public Health Service Indian Hospital and was the chief facility in [[Oklahoma]] providing comprehensive, preventative and other treatment services for the Choctaw.&lt;ref name="Choctaw Health System"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pyle|first1=Gregory E.|title=Having Options Making Choices – The Choctaw Nation Health Care System|url=http://www.ok.gov/abletech/documents/Indian%20Health%20Service%20Offices.pdf|website=OK.gov|accessdate=13 January 2015|page=2|date=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belvin worked with Floyd Gale Anderson, the first full-blood Indian to hold the position of Service Unit Director, to expand the Choctaw health system. Under their tutelage, to make health care more accessible, satellite clinics were opened in [[Broken Bow, Oklahoma|Broken Bow]], [[Hugo, Oklahoma|Hugo]] and [[McAlester, Oklahoma|McAlester]].&lt;ref name="Anderson obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=ANDERSON -- Floyd Gale|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/anderson/article_74cb149b-8e4e-547e-b94a-e8eb36b463af.html|accessdate=13 January 2015|publisher=Tulsa World|date=9 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during Belvin's term, in 1969. the Choctaw Nation created a Community Health Representative Program to help those Indians residing within the tribal service area of the Choctaw Nation boundaries to maintain health for their families.&lt;ref name="Health Representative Program"&gt;{{cite web|title=Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma Programs and Services|url=http://digital.libraries.ou.edu/utils/getfile/collection/choctawnat/id/7707/filename/7708.pdf|accessdate=13 January 2015|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program targets people who predominantly reside in rural settings and may not be near medical facilities&lt;ref name=Faiman-Silva&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faiman-Silva|first1=Sandra|title=Choctaws at the crossroads : the political economy of class and culture in the Oklahoma timber region|date=1997|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=0-8032-2001-4|page=164|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DS5LgMyvYNAC&amp;lpg|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and assists them with health checks, monitoring health issues, nutritional needs, education, and referral services.&lt;ref name="Health Representative Program" /&gt;

===Choctaw Nation Housing Authority===
In the 1960s as part of the [[War on Poverty]] programs introduced by [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B. Johnson]], Belvin submitted an application to the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) to create a tribal housing authority.&lt;ref name="Lambert 2007, pp 75-77"&gt;Lambert (2007), pp 75-77&lt;/ref&gt; He realized that Federal programs administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs were aimed primarily at reservation communities, and the unique status of Oklahoma tribes without extensive land bases, meant that  many programs designed for Indians did not benefit the Five Civilized Tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Kidwell (2007), p 211-212&lt;/ref&gt; He further had become aware that programs which the BIA had offered for loans, had evaporated with the enactment of the termination bill.&lt;ref name="Kidwell (2002)" /&gt; HUD denied Belvin's application based on various reasons, but included that the Choctaw were not policing tribal lands. In 1966,&lt;ref name="McKee (1980)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKee|first1=Jesse O.|last2=Schlenker|first2=Jon A.|title=The Choctaws : cultural evolution of a native American tribe|date=1980|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson, Miss.|isbn=0-87805-107-4|page=183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tf6CjSn17wgC&amp;lpg|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he then resubmitted the application under the requirements for a state agency,&lt;ref name="Lambert 2007, pp 75-77"/&gt; rather than a tribal authority, and designated himself, as chief, with the powers vested in a mayor for the purposes of the Act. According to the state requirements, a 5-person board of commissioners was appointed to oversee the housing authority.&lt;ref name="Housing Authority (1979)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Housing Authority Of Choctaw Nation v. Craytor|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/oklahoma/supreme-court/1979/48077.html|website=Justia U.S. Law|accessdate=9 January 2015|date=26 June 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1971, 364 homes&lt;ref name="Lambert 2007, pp 75-77"/&gt; designed for low-income Indian families to purchase or rehabilitate housing&lt;ref name="Mututal Help"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mutual Help Homeownership Opportunity Program for Indian Areas|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/programdescription/muthelp|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 116 units of low-rent housing had been finished, with an additional 274 homes under construction.&lt;ref name="Lambert 2007, pp 75-77"/&gt; By 1973, 885 houses had been completed and were occupied and an additional 331 were under construction.&lt;ref name="McKee (1980)" /&gt;

==Tribal Election of 1971==
On 22 October 1970, the US Congress passed an Act (84 Stat. 1091) authorizing each of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] to popularly elect their Principal Chief.&lt;ref name="five civilized tribes"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Choctaw Nation|url=http://www.fivecivilizedtribes.org/FiveTribes/Choctaw/ChoctawHistory.aspx|website=fivecivilizedtribes.org|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BIA selected an election committee of eight Choctaws to determine who would be eligible to vote in the first free election since the [[Dawes Act]]. The committee decided "to permit all lineal descendants of Choctaw by blood Dawes enrollees to vote," which resulted in about 25% of the ballots being from absentee voters.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (2007), p 77-79&lt;/ref&gt; Though Belvin won the election, it would be his last term as chief. His efforts at rebuilding the tribal structure were seen as insignificant and not aggressive enough, his failure to define membership procedures to admit unenrolled descendants of enrolled
members, and his lack of planning to develop the tribe led to his defeat in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (2007), pp 79-81&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hedley Norman Bull''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (10 June 1932 &amp;ndash; 18 May 1985) was Professor of [[International Relations]] at the [[Australian National University]], the [[London School of Economics]] and the [[University of Oxford]] until his death from cancer in 1985. He was [[Montague Burton Professor of International Relations]] at Oxford from 1977 to 1985, and died there.&lt;ref name="ANU Obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oa.anu.edu.au/obituary/bull-hedley-norman-175|title=Bull, Hedley Norman (1932–1985)|publisher=oa.anu.edu.au|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Bull was born in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], where he attended [[Fort Street High School]]. He went on to study history and philosophy at the [[University of Sydney]], where he was strongly influenced by the philosopher [[John Anderson (philosopher)|John Anderson]]. In 1953, Bull left Australia to study politics at Oxford, and after two years he was appointed to an assistant lectureship in international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).

In 1965, Bull was appointed director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Unit of the [[British Foreign Office]], forfeiting his Australian identity for British citizenship.&lt;ref name="Ayson"/&gt; Two years later, in 1967, he was appointed to a professorship of international relations at the Australian National University (ANU) in [[Canberra]].

In 1977, Bull published his main work, ''[[The Anarchical Society]]''. It is widely regarded as a key textbook in the field of international relations and is also seen as the central text in the so-called '[[English school of international relations theory|English School]]' of [[international relations]]. In this book, he argues that despite the [[Anarchism|anarchical]] character of the international arena, it is characterised by the formation of not only a system of states, but a society of states. His requirements for an entity to be called a [[Sovereign state|state]] are that it must claim [[sovereignty]] over (i) a group of [[People#In politics|people]] (ii) a defined territory, and that it must have a [[government]]. States form a system when they have a sufficient degree of interaction, and impact on each other's decisions, so as they "behave &amp;mdash; at least in some measure &amp;mdash; as parts of a whole." A system of states can exist without it also being a society of states. A society of states comes into existence "when a group of states, conscious of certain common interests and common values, form a society in the sense that they conceive themselves to be bound by a common set of rules in their relations with one another, and share in the working of common institutions."

The society of states is a way for Bull to analyse and assess possibilities of order in [[Geopolitics|world politics]]. He continues his argument by giving the concept of [[social order|order]] in social life, and the mechanisms of: the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]], [[international law]], [[diplomacy]], [[war]] and the [[great powers]] central roles. He finally concludes that, despite the existence of possible alternative forms of organization, the states system is our best chance of achieving order in world politics.

[[File:Bertie and arthur sullivan.jpg|thumb|right|Herbert Sullivan (right) with his uncle, [[Arthur Sullivan]], c. 1890]]
'''Herbert ('Bertie') Thomas Sullivan''' (13 May 1868 – 26 November 1928) was the nephew, heir and biographer of the British composer [[Arthur Sullivan]].  He grew up as his uncle's ward and worked briefly as an engineer.  After his uncle's death, Sullivan became active in charitable work. He was co-author of a 1927 biography of Arthur Sullivan, well regarded in its day, but later discredited because of its suppression of the composer's diary entries that mentioned his gambling and philandering.

Sullivan inherited many of his uncle's papers and original music manuscripts. Sullivan left most of these to his wife, who died in 1957, and they finally were sold to collectors in 1966.

==Biography==
Herbert Sullivan was the third child and eldest son of [[Fred Sullivan|Frederic]] and Charlotte Sullivan, one of eight siblings.{{refn|His brothers and sisters were: Amy Sophie (1863–1947), Florence Louise (1865–1891), Edith Mary (1866–1877), Maud "Cissie" Helen (1870–1940), [[Frederic Richard Sullivan]], George Arthur (1874–1919) and William Lacy (1877–1902).|group= n}} When Fred Sullivan died aged 39 in 1877, his younger brother, the composer [[Arthur Sullivan]], made himself responsible for the support of Fred's widow and eight children. In 1881, Charlotte married Captain Benjamin Hutchinson, a man 13 years her junior.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (2002), pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt; Charlotte emigrated to the US in 1883 with her husband and all her children except Herbert, who remained in England under the care of his uncle.{{refn|Charlotte died in January 1885, barely a year after the move to California. Hutchinson, unable to cope with this loss and his responsibilities, soon returned to England, leaving the six surviving California children (Edith had died) to be raised mostly by their uncle William Lacy, with the financial support of their uncle Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (2002), pp. 10–12&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} At the age of nine, Sullivan began boarding school in [[Brighton]], England.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; He studied in Germany in the autumn of 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Sullivan's health was precarious from the 1880s onwards, and Herbert often accompanied his uncle to the [[South of France]] and other resorts where the composer rested or spent holidays.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 8 April 1892, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1890, at 22 years of age, Herbert left his uncle's home for an engineering job connected with the laying of a cable between Haiti and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert soon returned to England, and he continued to spend much of his time with his uncle, continuing as his companion at the theatre and on trips. Though never formally adopted, Herbert was in many respects Arthur Sullivan's adopted son. He was at his uncle's bedside at his death in 1900.&lt;ref name=Sherr&gt;Sherr, Richard. ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'', Vol. 38, No. 3 (Autumn, 1985), pp. 637–43&lt;/ref&gt; When Arthur died, the German Emperor [[William II, German Emperor|Wilhelm]], an admirer of Sullivan's works, sent Herbert a personal message of condolence.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 November 1900, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert remained friendly with his uncle's collaborator, [[W. S. Gilbert]], after Arthur's death; when Herbert organised a [[Garrick Club]] dinner in 1908, in honour of Gilbert, the dramatist wrote, "My dear Sullivan, There is little need to tell you how deeply I appreciate the good feeling that actuated you in organizing yesterday's most successful dinner. It is an instance of friendship that can never fade from my memory".&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Gilbert to Herbert Sullivan, 4 October 1908, reproduced in Dark and Grey, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newman-Flower.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Newman Flower]] in 1917]]
After his uncle's death, Herbert Sullivan inherited the bulk of the composer's estate, including his diaries and many of his important musical manuscripts. He became prominent in ''pro bono publico'' activities, and in April 1915 he contributed the manuscript of ''[[Utopia Limited]]'' by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] to a charity auction in aid of the [[Red Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 27 April 1915, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; During the First World War, Herbert became a [[King's Messenger]]. While in this service, his ship was hit by a torpedo, and he spent hours in the freezing waters of the North Sea. Afterwards, he found walking painful and used a cane.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (2009), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; While on his yacht ''Zola'', in 1921, he retrieved mail from the [[English Channel]] after an aeroplane crash.{{refn|On 26 August 1921, Sullivan [[1921 SNETA Farman Goliath ditching|witnessed the crash]] of a [[Farman F.60 Goliath|Farman Goliath]] aircraft of [[SNETA]] into the English Channel off [[Calais]], France, while sailing ''Zola''. He reported the crash and retrieved a bag of mail from the sea.&lt;ref&gt;"Wreck of an Air Mail", ''The Times'', 27 August 1921, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} In 1923 he married Elena Margarita Vincent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=%2FLeaGRWSLNBL3ic8hmlLAg&amp;scan=1 Marriages registered in April, May &amp; June 1923], freebmd.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Warden of the [[Worshipful Company of Musicians]] in 1925 and as Master of the Company in 1926.

In 1927 Sullivan collaborated with [[Newman Flower]] on a biography of Arthur Sullivan. As Sullivan and Flower had exclusive access to the composer's diaries, the biography was regarded at the time as uniquely authoritative. Subsequently, when wider access to the diaries became possible, it was seen that Sullivan had suppressed mention of his uncle's gambling and womanising, and this evasion, combined with the lack of musical analysis in the biography, led to a lowering of its status among scholars.&lt;ref name=Sherr/&gt;

Herbert Sullivan died suddenly in London in 1928, aged 60.  His estate included many of his uncle's manuscripts. His widow remarried about 1929, becoming Mrs Elena M. Bashford.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 5 December 1929, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;Allen, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; and the manuscripts were sold at auction in 1966 by her estate, some going to museums and collectors in America and others remaining in England.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 14 June 1966, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the autograph scores were bought by the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] scholar and collector [[Terence Rees|Dr Terence Rees]] and others by dealers.&lt;ref&gt;A list of the sales is found in ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Journal'', vol. 9, no. 3, September 1966, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hüsnüşah Hatun''' (died c. 1513), was a consort of Sultan [[Bayezid II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Life==
Hüsnüşah Hatun was born in 1454 to a Nasuh Bey. Bayezid was still a şehzade and the governor of Amasya sanjak when she gave birth to Şehzade Şehinşah in 1474, followed by Sultanzade Hatun.

According to Turkish tradition, all princes were expected to work as provincial governors as a part of their training. In 1481 Şehinşah, was sent to Manisa sanjak and then in 1483 to [[Karaman Province|Karaman]], and Hüsnüşah accompanied him. She built and endowed a mosque at [[Manisa]] in 1490.

After Şehzade Şehinşah's death in 1511, Hüsnüşah Hatun came to [[Bursa]]. Hüsnüşah Hatun also corresponded with [[Selim I]], Şehinşah's victorious brother, on behalf of Mevlana Pir Ahmed Çelebi, a scholar who had been at Şehinşah's court and who was neglected when the members of the prince's household were assigned new posts. She lies buried in [[Muradiye Complex]], [[Bursa]].

'''Irma L. Lindheim''' (1886–1978), born in New York, was a [[Zionist]] fund-raiser and educator.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SH8r3ntJG8AC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=%22irma+lindheim%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vbSAT7STA-aY0QGyrOydCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CE8Q6wEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22irma%20lindheim%22&amp;f=false |title=Gender and Judaism: The Transformation of Tradition - Tamar Rudavsky - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bare_url_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gEj0oLYK10sC&amp;pg=PA857&amp;dq=%22irma+lindheim%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vbSAT7STA-aY0QGyrOydCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEkQ6wEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22irma%20lindheim%22&amp;f=false |title=Jewish Women in America: A-L - Paula Hyman, Deborah Dash Moore, American Jewish Historical Society - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Early life ==
Lindheim was born '''Irma Levy''' in [[New York City]] on December 9, 1886, to a German-Jewish family with roots in the American South.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt; Her father, Robert Levy, was a business man, and her mother, Mathilda (née Morgenstern) stayed at home and raised Irma and her sisters, Amy and Edna. Though Lindheim would later attend a Jewish seminary, her early life at home was largely devoid of Jewish ritual; the family had Christmas trees in their home and declined to celebrate Jewish holidays.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt; 

Irma, refusing to consent to her father's insistence that he choose her husband, married Norvin R. Lindheim in 1907, a young attorney and graduate of [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] and [[Columbia Law School|Columbia University Law School]]. Together, they had five children, and when Irma's father died in 1914, she inherited a small fortune. 

== Initial Zionist activity ==
She served as the only Jewish female first lieutenant in the Motor Corps of America during [[World War I]], starting in 1917.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt; Around this time, Lindheim, inspired by an Ethical Culture teacher, decided to further educate herself on her [[Judaism]]. After visiting her husband's cousin in [[Baltimore]], where she met American Zionists and Palestinian Jews, she decided to dedicate herself to [[Zionism]].&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt; She began to lecture on the subject, and, recognizing her leadership potential, [[Henrietta Szold]], head of the cultural division of the [[American Zionist Organization]], named Lindehim to the chair of New York's Seventh Zionist District. There, she oversaw the creation of a cultural center, the opening of which was attended by prominent Zionist and [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] Justice Louis [[Louis Brandeis|Brandeis]].&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt; Though the center was initially successful, a dispute between Brandeis and [[Chaim Weizmann]] at the 1921 Zionist Convention led to the closing of the center.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt; 

=== Rabbinical education ===
In 1922 she entered the Jewish Institute of Religion in New York City, becoming the first woman in the U.S. to attend a Jewish seminary. As the first female student of the Institute, she was relegated to special student status. In 1923, she petitioned the faculty to change her status from that of [[Matriculation#Special_student|special student]] to a regular student in the rabbinic program; in response, in May of that year they unanimously recommended the admission of women to the Institute on the same basis as men.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; However, in 1925, she decided to drop her studies and traveled to Palestine. 

=== First visit to Palestine ===
During her visit (later described in her book, ''The Immortal Adventure'', published in 1928), Lindehim was able to attend the opening ceremony of [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]] and was introduced to [[Manya Shochat|Manya Shohat]], who would later become a lifelong friend. Shoat helped Lindheim tour the country, taking her to the kibbutz she called home, [[Kfar Giladi|K'far Giladi]]. After touring the [[Negev]], Lindheim was newly energized for the Zionist cause.

== Hadassah presidency ==
After a short period of fundraising, Lindheim became the second president of [[Hadassah]], in 1926.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt; At the time, the [[Zionist Organization of America]], then-president [[Louis Lipsky]] was pressuring Hadassah to give up their autonomy and fold into the ZOA. Lindheim fought against that pressure and eventually succeeded, was re-elected president in 1927, and served as Hadassah's delegate to the [[World Zionist Congress]] in [[Basel]]. When she returned, she joined the [[Labor Zionism|Labor Zionist]] [[Poale Zion]], prompting the Hadassah board to demand her resignation on the grounds of conflict of interest. Lindheim resigned her post and began to raise funds for [[Histadrut]] and [[Hashomer Hatzair]], organizations that defined themselves as further left than Hadassah.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt;

== Back to Palestine ==
In March 1933, Lindheim moved to Palestine with her children (Norvin had died in 1928) and attempted to found a Histadrut-funded clearing house for new immigrants. Finding this unfulfilling, she moved to Kibbutz [[Mishmar HaEmek]].&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt; At 47, she was about 25 years older than the average kibbutz member.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt; 

During World War II, she was drafted by [[Jewish National Fund|Keren Kayemet]] to solicit funding for Zionist causes in England. She also remained active in prodding Hadassah during this time, petitioning them to increase their work with the Zionist youth movement. Briefly moving back to America, she mounted an unsuccessful congressional campaign as candidate for the [[American Labor Party]] in [[Queens]], New York, in 1948 (when she appeared at rallies for Progressive presidential candidate [[Henry A. Wallace]] and ran with Brooklyn ALP candidate [[Lee Pressman]]), sending her back to what was now Israel.&lt;ref&gt;

There, she helped to create Kibbutz [[Adamit]] and Kibbutz [[Ein HaShofet]]. ''Shofet'', which means "judge" in Hebrew, was chosen to honor Louis Brandeis. Dubbed the "grandmother of the kibbutz" by the Israeli press, she moved back to the U.S. in the mid-60's, continuing to write articles and essays for Zionist publications. 

In 1962 she published her autobiography ''Parallel Quest: A Search of a Person and a People''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/lindheim-irma-levy|title=Irma Levy Lindheim &amp;#124; Jewish Women's Archive|date=|publisher=Jwa.org|accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindheim died on April 10, 1978, in Berkeley, California.

'''Jack William Nicklaus''' (born January 21, 1940), nicknamed '''The Golden Bear''', is an American retired [[professional golfer]]. Many observers regard him as the greatest golfer of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Auclair|first1=T.J.|title=10 Greatest golfers of all time|url=http://www.pga.com/news/golf-buzz/10-greatest-golfers-all-time|website=pga.com|accessdate=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chase|first=Chris|date=April 13, 2018|title=Who is the greatest golfer ever: Tiger or Jack?|url=https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/04/tiger-woods-jack-nickalus|work=[[USA Today]]|location=McLean, Virginia|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a span of more than 25 years, he won a record 18 [[Men's major golf championships|major championships]] while producing 19 second-place and 9 third-place finishes.&lt;ref name="Top50"&gt;{{cite book |last=Spencer |first=Reid |title=The Sporting News selects 50 Greatest Golfers |publisher=The Sporting News |isbn=0-89204-692-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicklaus focused on the major championships—[[Masters Tournament]], [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship|Open Championship]] and [[PGA Championship]]—and played a selective schedule of regular [[PGA Tour]] events, yet still finished with 73 victories, third on the all-time list behind [[Sam Snead]] (82) and [[Tiger Woods]] (80).

Nicklaus won the [[U.S. Amateur]] in 1959 and 1961 and challenged for the [[1960 U.S. Open (golf)|1960 U.S. Open]], where he finished in second place, two shots behind [[Arnold Palmer]]. Nicklaus turned professional at age 21 toward the end of 1961. He earned his first professional win at the [[1962 U.S. Open (golf)|1962 U.S. Open]], when he defeated Palmer by three shots in a next day 18-hole playoff. This win over Palmer began the on-course rivalry between the two golf superstars. In 1966, Nicklaus won the Masters Tournament for the second year in a row, becoming the first golfer to achieve this distinction, and also won The Open Championship, completing his career slam of major championships.&lt;ref name=open&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theopen.com/en/History/OpenChampions.aspx#player=Jack+NICKLAUS |title=1966 Jack Nicklaus |publisher=The Open |accessdate=October 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016164928/http://www.theopen.com/en/History/OpenChampions.aspx |archivedate=October 16, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 26, he became the youngest to do so at the time. He won another Open Championship in 1970.&lt;ref name=open/&gt;

Between 1971 and 1980, he won an additional nine major championships, overtook [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]]' record of 13 majors, and became the first player to complete double and triple career slams of golf's four professional major championships. When Nicklaus claimed his 18th and final major championship at age 46 at the [[1986 Masters Tournament|1986 Masters]], he became the tournament's oldest winner. Nicklaus joined the Senior PGA Tour (now known as the [[PGA Tour Champions]])  when he became eligible in January 1990, and by April 1996 had won 10 tournaments, including eight major championships despite playing a very limited schedule. He continued to play at least some of the four regular Tour majors until 2005, when he made his final appearances at the Masters Tournament and The Open Championship.

Nicklaus has also taken part in various other activities, including [[golf course design]], charity work and book writing. He is a member of the [[American Society of Golf Course Architects]] and has helped design courses such as [[Harbour Town Golf Links]]. Nicklaus also runs his own tournament on the PGA Tour, the [[Memorial Tournament]]. His golf course design company is one of the largest in the world. Nicklaus' books vary from instructional to autobiographical, with his ''Golf My Way'' considered one of the best instructional golf books of all time; the video of the same name is the best selling golf instructional to date.

==Early life and amateur golf pursuits==
Nicklaus was born in [[Columbus, Ohio]] and grew up in the suburb of [[Upper Arlington, Ohio|Upper Arlington]]. He is of [[German American|German descent]], the son of Helen (Schoener) (1909–2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/12954763/nellie-helen-nicklaus|title=Nellie Helen Schoener Nicklaus (1909–2000)|website=www.findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Charlie Nicklaus (1913–1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/12954762/louis-charles-nicklaus|title=Louis Charles "Charlie" Nicklaus (1913–1970)|website=www.findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pharmacist who ran several businesses named Nicklaus Drug Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.golfchannel.com/news/golf-central-blog/know-jack-charlie-and-helen-nicklaus/|title=Know Jack: Charlie and Helen Nicklaus - Golf Channel|work=golfchannel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlie was a skilled all-round athlete who had played football for the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State Buckeyes]] and had gone on to play semi-professional football under an assumed name for the [[Portsmouth Spartans]] (who later became the [[NFL]]'s [[Detroit Lions]]). Charlie had also been a scratch golfer and local [[tennis]] champion in his youth.&lt;ref name=fairway&gt;{{cite book |title=On &amp; Off the Fairway |first1=Jack |last1=Nicklaus |first2=Ken |last2=Bowden |year=1978 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-0671225681}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rivalry/&gt; Charlie Nicklaus died of [[pancreatic cancer]] at age fifty six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.everydayhealth.com/pancreatic-cancer/1006/dana-delany-jack-nicklaus-lisa-niemi-swayze-unite-to-raise-awareness-for-pancreatic-cancer.aspx|title=Pancreatic Cancer Action Network Raises Awareness for Pancreatic Cancer|work=everydayhealth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicklaus was raised in Upper Arlington and attended [[Upper Arlington High School (Ohio)|Upper Arlington High School]], whose nickname and mascot are coincidentally the Golden Bears. In his senior year, Nicklaus was an honorable mention All-Ohio selection in [[basketball]] as a shooting guard, and he received some recruiting interest from college basketball programs, including Ohio State. During his youth, he also competed successfully in football, baseball, tennis, and track and field.&lt;ref name=fairway/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wicked Game: Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, and the Story of Modern Golf |first=Howard |last=Sounes |authorlink=Howard Sounes |year=2005 |publisher=William Morrow |isbn=978-0-06-051386-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicklaus took up golf at the age of 10, scoring a 51 at [[Scioto Country Club]] for his first nine holes ever played. Charlie Nicklaus had joined Scioto that same year, returning to golf to help heal a [[volleyball]] injury. Jack Nicklaus was coached at Scioto by club pro [[Jack Grout]], a Texas-developed contemporary of golf greats [[Byron Nelson]] and [[Ben Hogan]]; Grout had played quite successfully on the [[PGA Tour]] and would become Nicklaus' lifelong golf instructor.&lt;ref name=fairway/&gt; Nicklaus overcame a [[List of polio survivors|mild case]] of [[polio]] as a 13-year-old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Guy |last=Yocum |title=My Shot: Jack Nicklaus |url=http://www.golfdigest.com/magazine/myshot_gd0404 |magazine=[[Golf Digest]] |date=April 2004 |accessdate=May 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicklaus won the first of five straight&lt;ref name="Golf My Way"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nicklaus |first1=Jack |last2=Bowden |first2=Ken |title=Golf My Way |publisher=William Heinemann Ltd |year=1974 |isbn=1-85051-475-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio State Junior titles at the age of 12. At 13, he broke 70 at Scioto Country Club for the first time, and became that year's youngest qualifier into the [[U.S. Junior Amateur]], where he survived three match-play rounds. He had earned a handicap of +3 at age 13, the lowest in the Columbus area.&lt;ref name=fairway/&gt;&lt;ref name=rivalry/&gt; Nicklaus won the Tri-State High School Championship (Ohio/[[Kentucky]]/[[Indiana]]) at the age of 14 with a round of 68, and also recorded his first [[hole-in-one]] in tournament play the same year. At 15, Nicklaus shot a 66 at Scioto Country Club, which was the amateur course record, and qualified for his first [[U.S. Amateur]]. He won the [[Ohio Open]] in 1956 at age 16, highlighted by a phenomenal third round of 64, competing against professionals. In all, Nicklaus won 27 events in the Ohio area from age 10 to age 17.

In 1957, Nicklaus won the [[International Jaycee Junior Golf Tournament]], having lost the previous year in a playoff. Nicklaus also competed in his first of 44 consecutive [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]s that year, but missed the cut. In 1958 at age 18, he competed in his first PGA Tour event, the Rubber City Open, at [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], Ohio, tying for 12th place after being just one out of the lead at the 36-hole mark,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B14FE3C5F117B93C7A9178CD85F4C8585F9 |title=Wall's 67 for 132 Keeps Golf Lead; Bolt, Phillips, Nicklaus and Balding Share Second, a Stroke Back, at Akron |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 4, 1958 |agency=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made the cut in the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], tying for 41st place. Nicklaus also won two [[Trans-Mississippi Amateur]]s – in 1958 at [[Prairie Dunes Country Club]] and 1959 at Woodhill Country Club, with final match victories of 9 &amp; 8 and 3 &amp; 2, respectively. Also in 1959, Nicklaus won the [[North and South Amateur]] at [[Pinehurst, North Carolina]] and competed in three additional [[PGA Tour]] events, with his best finish being another 12th place showing at the [[Buick Open]].

While attending [[Ohio State Buckeyes|Ohio State]], he won the [[U.S. Amateur]] twice (1959, 1961), and an [[NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships|NCAA Championship]] (1961). In the 1959 U.S. Amateur, Nicklaus defeated two-time winner and defending champion [[Charles Coe]] 1-up in the final 36-hole match when he birdied the eighteenth hole.&lt;ref name=nwnanxpl&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lztYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XPcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3302,1924641 |newspaper=The Bulletin |location=[[Bend, Oregon]] |agency=United Press International |title=Nicklaus wins National Am; nixes pro life |date=September 21, 1959 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was significant not only because of Coe's proven ability as a player, but also because Nicklaus became the then-youngest champion in the modern era, second only to [[Robert A. Gardner (golfer)|Robert A. Gardner]], who won in 1909. In 1961, Nicklaus became the first player to win the individual title at the NCAA Championship and the U.S. Amateur in the same year. He was followed by [[Phil Mickelson]] (1990), [[Tiger Woods]] (1996), [[Ryan Moore (golfer)|Ryan Moore]] (2004), and [[Bryson DeChambeau]] (2015). Nicklaus also won the NCAA [[Big Ten Conference]] Championship that year with a 72-hole aggregate of 283, while earlier claiming the [[Western Amateur]] in New Orleans. In his second and last U.S. Amateur win in 1961, Nicklaus convincingly defeated [[Dudley Wysong]] 8 &amp; 6 at [[Pebble Beach Golf Links|Pebble Beach]] in the 36-hole championship match. For the week, Nicklaus was 20 strokes under par, including 34 birdies and two eagles.

At the [[1960 U.S. Open (golf)|1960 U.S. Open]], twenty-year-old Nicklaus shot a two-under par 282, finishing in second place two strokes behind [[Arnold Palmer]], who won the tournament for the only time with a final round charge of six-under-par 65. This score remains the lowest ever by an amateur in the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]. Nicklaus played the final 36 holes with [[Ben Hogan]], who later remarked that he had just played 36 holes with a kid who should have won by 10 shots. During the final 36 holes, Nicklaus was two-under-par; he had shot every round of the tournament at or below par and was the only entrant to do so. Nicklaus had led by two shots with six holes to play. In 1960, Nicklaus also tied for 13th in the [[Masters Tournament]]. He tied for fourth in the 1961 [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], three shots behind champion [[Gene Littler]], having played the final 54 holes one under par. Each of these three major championship finishes designated Nicklaus as low amateur. However, Nicklaus' one-under-par 287 tied for seventh in the 1961 [[Masters Tournament]], and was second that year only to [[Charles Coe]]'s low amateur placing, when he tied for second with Arnold Palmer at seven-under par 281, one shot behind champion [[Gary Player]].

Nicklaus represented the United States against Great Britain and Ireland on winning [[Walker Cup]] teams in both 1959 and 1961, decisively winning both of his matches in each contest. On the 1959 trip to Britain, he also made his only attempt at the [[British Amateur]], the world's oldest international amateur event, at [[Royal St George's Golf Club]], reaching the quarterfinal round (top 8).&lt;ref name=fairway/&gt; He was also a member of the victorious 1960 U.S. [[Eisenhower Trophy]] team, winning the unofficial individual title by 13 shots over teammate [[Deane Beman]] with a four-round score of 269, a record which still stands; this score was 18 shots lower than [[Ben Hogan]]'s earlier [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] aggregate of 287 at the same site (which had, however, been scored under much tougher conditions).&lt;ref name=fairway/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalgolffederation.org/2006/men/FactSheet.html|title=2006 World Amateur Championship Fact Sheet|accessdate=March 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For three straight years (1959–1961), Nicklaus was named the world's top amateur golfer by ''[[Golf Digest]]'' magazine.

===College studies and marriage===
Nicklaus attended Ohio State from 1957 to 1961. He majored in pre-[[pharmacy]] and had good grades in his first three years; he intended to follow his father into pharmacy after graduation.&lt;ref name=nwnanxpl/&gt;&lt;ref name=nsthwtp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H7BPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5AQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6981,2995885 |newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner |location=[[Ocala, Florida]] |agency=Associated Press |title=Nicklaus says that he won't turn pro |date=August 24, 1959 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his amateur golf achievements mounted, Nicklaus changed his mind on his career path; he switched programs to study [[insurance]]. At that stage, he planned to remain an amateur golfer and earn his living by selling insurance. For a time, he worked in the insurance field while he also attended college. He married Barbara Bash (b. 1940), who was a nursing student at Ohio State,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jack-columbus.pgatour.com/13-meeting-barbara|title=Meeting Barbara - Mr. Columbus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 1960,&lt;ref name=ckelifar&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/content/blog-post/john-boyette/2010-07-23/nicklauses-celebrate-50-years?v=1279895179 |newspaper=Augusta Chronicle |last=Boyette |first=John |title=Nicklauses celebrate 50 years |date=July 23, 2010 |accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their first of five children, Jack Jr., was born in September 1961, but the following month, Nicklaus was still intent on becoming the first amateur to win the Masters.&lt;ref name=nwtpdp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xswVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HhEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2233,420008 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=Associated Press |title=Nicklaus won't turn pro, despite pressure |date=October 21, 1961 |page=4-part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abptan&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Sv4sAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8s4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=849,4538450 |newspaper=Palm Beach Post |agency=Associated Press |title=Attractive bait put to entice Nicklaus |date=October 24, 1961 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early November, he changed his mind and announced that he was turning professional in order to support his family.&lt;ref name=abejtp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mXBAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AVkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2634,2764789 |newspaper=Youngstown Vindicator |agency=Associated Press |title=Amateurs breathing easy, Jack Nicklaus turns pro |date=November 9, 1961 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aknrhtp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wgJdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BVoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5112,2271600 |newspaper=St. Joseph Gazette |agency=Associated Press |location=[[St. Joseph, Missouri]] |title=Amateur king Nicklaus reports he'll turn pro |date=November 9, 1961 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wound up a few course hours short of graduating from college. In a goodwill gesture, Ohio State granted him an honorary doctorate in 1972.&lt;ref name=fairway/&gt;

==PGA Tour career==

===Professional breakthrough: 1962–1963===
Nicklaus began his career on the [[PGA Tour]] in 1962. While Nicklaus officially turned professional in late 1961, he heavily debated the idea of remaining an amateur in order to further emulate his idol, [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]]. However, Nicklaus realized that in order to be regarded as the best, he would have to compete in greater frequency against the best. Shortly after turning professional, Nicklaus' future agent, [[Mark McCormack]], was interviewed by ''Melbourne Age'' writer [[Don Lawrence]], who inquired about the American golf scene. When McCormack described Nicklaus, Lawrence referred to the "large, strong, and blond" player as "the Golden Bear," a nickname that would become synonymous with Nicklaus throughout his professional life. However, another possible origination of the name derives from the [[Upper Arlington High School|high school]] that Nicklaus attended in Upper Arlington, Ohio, which uses the mascot the Golden Bears for its sports teams. As mentioned above, Nicklaus played on several Golden Bear athletic teams, including captaining its 1956 state-champion golf squad, suggesting that McCormack may have adopted the name through Nicklaus' high school affiliation. Regardless, by 1963, the nickname had stuck.

Nicklaus won his first PGA tournament in his 17th start, when he defeated  [[Arnold Palmer]] in a Sunday playoff at [[Oakmont Country Club|Oakmont]] for the 1962 [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]; Nicklaus earned $17,500 for his efforts. The galleries were more vocal in their support for Palmer—who had grown up in nearby [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania|Latrobe]]—but Nicklaus won the playoff by three shots (71 to 74). In 90 holes, Nicklaus had only one three-putt green. The [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] victory made Nicklaus the reigning U.S. Open and [[U.S. Amateur]] champion. In addition, at age 22, Nicklaus was the youngest U.S. Open champion since Bobby Jones won at age 21 in 1923, and he has remained the youngest winner since (John McDermott is still the youngest winner of the U.S. Open at age 19 in 1911).&lt;ref&gt;The Boston Globe, August 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Open win thrust Nicklaus into the national spotlight, and he was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. This was also the beginning of the Nicklaus-Palmer rivalry, which attracted viewers to golf on television.&lt;ref name=rivalry&gt;{{cite book |title=Arnie &amp; Jack: Palmer, Nicklaus, and Golf's Greatest Rivalry |last=O'Connor |first=Ian |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |date=April 11, 2008 |isbn=0-618-75446-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1962, Nicklaus had won two more tournaments, which were back-to-back in the [[Seattle Open]] and [[Portland Open]]. In addition, he tied for third in his first attempt at the [[PGA Championship]]. Nicklaus completed the year with over $60,000 in prize-money, made 26 of 26 cuts with 16 top-10 finishes, placed third on the PGA Tour money list, and was named Rookie of the Year. He also won the inaugural staging of the World Series of Golf, a select-field event for the year's major champions, and collected another $50,000 (unofficial money) for that win.&lt;ref name="Golf My Way"/&gt;

In 1963, Nicklaus won two of the four majors—the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]] and the [[PGA Championship]]. These victories made him the then-youngest winner of the Masters and third-youngest winner of the PGA Championship, and each win came in just his second year as a professional. Earlier in 1963, Nicklaus injured his left hip playing an approach shot from the rough—an injury that would manifest itself years later. Ironically, Nicklaus credits this injury with assisting him in altering his swing heading into the 1963 Masters, thus allowing him to play a draw more easily. Along with three other wins including the [[Tournament of Champions (PGA Tour)|Tournament of Champions]], he placed second to [[Arnold Palmer]] on the PGA Tour money list with just over $100,000.&lt;ref name="Golf My Way"/&gt; He also teamed with Palmer to win the [[Canada Cup (golf)|Canada Cup]] (now the [[World Cup of Golf]]) in France, representing the United States (this event was shortened to 63 holes due to heavy fog). Nicklaus also finished as low individual scorer for that event.

====Business success====
Nicklaus' meteoric rise to fame immediately after turning professional brought opportunities for him to earn significant endorsement income.&lt;ref name=nssssn&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AZscAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wmUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5365%2C1032152 |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |location=Florida |agency=Associated Press |last=Grimsley |first=Will |title=Nicklaus: none so successful so soon |date=April 4, 1965 |page=3D }}&lt;/ref&gt; These business opportunities were facilitated by [[Mark McCormack]], who also managed Palmer and [[Gary Player]]. Golf was growing rapidly in popularity and media coverage during the early 1960s, led by the performances of these three star players. Palmer's charging style and popularity with the galleries made him the world's most marketable sports figure. This association was the start of the agency that became known as [[International Management Group]], and IMG, after building a base in golf management, eventually expanded into other sports. The Palmer-Nicklaus-Player rivalry developed into the so-called "Big Three" of Golf. McCormack set up a series of televised golf matches around the world amongst the three stars, known as Big Three Golf, in the early 1960s. Nicklaus left IMG in the early 1970s, to set up his own management agency, Golden Bear Inc.&lt;ref name=rivalry/&gt;

===Continued excellence: 1964–1967===
Despite winning no majors in 1964 (he had three runner-up finishes), Nicklaus led the PGA Tour money list for the first time in his career by a slim margin of $81.13 over Palmer. At [[The Open Championship]] at [[Old Course at St Andrews|St Andrews]], Nicklaus set a new record for the lowest score in the final 36 holes with 66-68 in high winds (the first time in the championship's history that 70 had been broken in each of the last two rounds). This was not enough, however, to win the event; Nicklaus placed second to [[Tony Lema]].&lt;ref name="Golf My Way"/&gt; Nicklaus also set a record for the lowest final round score in the PGA Championship with a 64 (since broken by [[Brad Faxon]] in 1995 with a 63), but fell three shots short of champion [[Bobby Nichols]] and his record-setting 271 score. In 31 official worldwide events in 1964, Nicklaus achieved six victories, seven runners-up, placed in the top-five 21 times, the top-10 21 times, and had only one missed cut. Nicklaus and Palmer also defended their team title at the [[World Cup (men's golf)|World Cup]] in Hawaii, with Nicklaus again finishing as low individual scorer.

When Nicklaus won the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]] in 1965 and 1966, he became the tournament's first back-to-back winner and the youngest two-time and three-time winner. He broke [[Ben Hogan]]'s 72-hole scoring record of 274 in 1953 when he compiled a new aggregate of 271 in the [[1965 Masters Tournament]]. This record was tied by [[Raymond Floyd]] in 1976 and lasted until [[Tiger Woods]] shot 270 in 1997, which was a 72-hole record that was subsequently tied by [[Jordan Spieth]] in 2015. When Woods and Spieth shot 270, the scores were achieved with significantly improved golf equipment on essentially the same-length golf course over which Nicklaus and Floyd shot 271. During the 1965 tournament, Nicklaus hit 62 of 72 greens in regulation and had 123 putts, inclusive of just one three-putt green. This was good enough to win by nine shots over [[Arnold Palmer]] and [[Gary Player]]; this margin of victory was a tournament record that would last for 32 years until Woods won by 12 shots in 1997. The week's performance was highlighted by a third-round 64 that consisted of eight birdies and no bogeys. It was of this round that Nicklaus said, "I had never before and have never since played quite as fine a complete round of golf in a major championship as I did in the third round of the 1965 Masters". This round tied [[Lloyd Mangrum]]'s record set in 1940 at [[Augusta National]] and remained in place until [[Nick Price]] shot 63 during the third round in 1986. It was at this time that [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] stated Nicklaus played a game with which he was unfamiliar; Jones called Nicklaus' result "the greatest performance in all of golfing history."

After Nicklaus' record performance at Augusta National in 1965,  the course underwent some minor changes to make it tougher. These modifications and the difficult weather in the [[1966 Masters Tournament|1966 tournament]] did not deter Nicklaus. He successfully defended his title with an even-par aggregate of 288, 17 shots higher. He won in an 18-hole playoff over [[Gay Brewer]] (Brewer had three-putted the 18th green to force the playoff) and [[Tommy Jacobs]] by shooting a two-under-par 70. Nicklaus led the PGA Tour money list again in 1965 by a healthy margin over Tony Lema. Nicklaus and Lema formed the U.S. team for the World Cup, held in [[Madrid]], Spain,&lt;ref name=fairway/&gt; but could not defend the title, as South Africa won. In all, Nicklaus competed in 28 official worldwide events in 1965, accumulating five victories, seven runners-up, 19 top-5 finishes, 23 top-10 finishes, and zero missed cuts.

In 1966, Nicklaus also won [[The Open Championship]] at [[Muirfield]] in Scotland under difficult weather conditions; he used his driver just 17 times because of very heavy rough. This was the only major he had failed to win up to that point. This win made him the youngest player, age 26 (his fifth year on Tour), and the only one after [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Ben Hogan]], and [[Gary Player]] (until Tiger Woods at age 24 in 2000, also during his fifth year on Tour) to win all four major championships, now known as the Career Slam. Nicklaus eventually accomplished the double career slam in 1971 and the triple career slam in 1978, winning all four majors two and three times, respectively. Nicklaus was part of another title for the U.S. in the [[World Cup (men's golf)|World Cup]] in Japan. Nicklaus concluded 1966 playing 22 official worldwide events, with four victories, four runners-up, 14 top-5 finishes, 16 top-10 finishes, and zero missed cuts.

In [[1967 U.S. Open (golf)|1967]], Nicklaus won the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] for a second time. The tournament was held at [[Baltusrol Golf Club|Baltusrol]], and he broke Hogan's 72-hole record by one shot with a 275 when he birdied the par 5 18th hole.&lt;ref name="Golf My Way"/&gt; During the four rounds, Nicklaus hit 61 of 72 greens in regulation. Nicklaus finished this record win with a dramatic 238-yard 1-iron shot, uphill into a breeze and light rain, to the 72nd green (an approximate 260-yard equivalent) and holing a {{convert|22|ft|m|adj=on}} birdie putt to close out a final nine of 30 and final round of 65 to beat [[Arnold Palmer]] by four shots. Nicklaus and Palmer were the only two players to break par for the week. ''Sports Illustrated'' ran a cover photo of Nicklaus throwing his leg high in the air with the headline, "Nicklaus Breaks the Open Record."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1967/06/26/610071/jack-delivers-the-crusher |title=Jack Delivers The Crusher |magazine=Sports Illustrated |first=Alfred |last=Wright |date=June 26, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also finished runner up in [[The Open Championship]] and third in the [[PGA Championship]], one shot out of a playoff between [[Don January]] and [[Don Massengale]]. In 1967, Nicklaus led the PGA Tour money list for the third time. Later that year, Nicklaus and Palmer teamed up for a 13-shot wire-to-wire [[World Cup (men's golf)|World Cup]] victory in [[Mexico City]]. Nicklaus competed in 24 official worldwide events in 1967, with five victories, four runners-up, 14 top-5 finishes, 16 top-10 finishes, and one missed cut. For most of his professional career, Nicklaus employed [[Angelo Argea]] as his caddie.

===Career downturn (1968–1970)===
After Nicklaus won the [[1967 U.S. Open (golf)|1967 U.S. Open]] in record breaking fashion, he did not win another major championship until the [[1970 Open Championship]] at the [[Old Course at St Andrews]]. Moreover, his highest finish on the Tour money list for the years 1968–70 was second; his lowest was fourth, his worst ranking on the list since turning professional. However, it should be noted that his fourth-place ranking in 1970 would have been elevated to second if [[The Open Championship]] winnings were included during that period in the official PGA Tour money list, as they are today. Nicklaus finished runner-up in both the 1968 U.S. Open (to new rival [[Lee Trevino]]) and the 1968 Open Championship (to old rival Gary Player).

Nicklaus did not make his inaugural appearance in the [[Ryder Cup]] until [[1969 Ryder Cup|1969]] at age 29; eligibility rules at the time required a minimum five-year PGA Tour membership before points could be counted for team qualification; rules have been relaxed significantly since.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt; In the [[1969 Ryder Cup]], the entire competition came down to the anchor singles match between Nicklaus and [[Tony Jacklin]]. At the par-5 17th hole with Nicklaus leading by the score of 1 up, Jacklin made a {{convert|35|ft|sing=on}} eagle putt to square the match. With the entire competition outcome riding on this match, Nicklaus made a five-foot par putt on the last hole before controversially conceding Jacklin's par putt, ensuring that this game, and the overall match, ended in a tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rydercup.com/2008/usa/history/results/1969.html |title=The 2008 Ryder Cup – History – 1969 |publisher=Ryder Cup |accessdate=December 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards United States team Captain Sam Snead said "This is the greatest golf match you have ever seen in England".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=I8paAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=u3sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1271,2026044&amp;dq=tony+jacklin+sam+snead+ryder+cup&amp;hl=en |title=Yanks great golf good for tie |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |agency=AP |date=September 22, 1969 |page=4-C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, Nicklaus' physical condition declined somewhat; he put on some excess weight, which affected his stamina. Following the Ryder Cup, he significantly improved his condition in the fall of 1969 by losing {{convert|25|lb}} in one month,&lt;ref name=wtlose70&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4ppQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NuEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6555%2C2916364 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |agency=Associated Press |title=Jack seeks 2nd title sweep |date=August 14, 1970 |page=3B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his game started to return to top form.&lt;ref name="story"&gt;{{cite book |title=Jack Nicklaus: My Story |last1=Nicklaus |first1=Jack |last2=Bowden |first2=Ken |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-684-83628-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1970, Nicklaus' father, Charlie Nicklaus, died. Five months after this, Nicklaus won the [[1970 Open Championship]] under difficult scoring conditions in Scotland where the wind howled up to 56 MPH, defeating fellow American [[Doug Sanders]] in an 18-hole playoff round in emotional fashion. On the 18th hole of the playoff, Nicklaus drove about 380 yards, through the par-4 green with a three-wood, and was forced to pitch back to the hole. His eagle pitch finished approximately eight feet short of the hole. Nicklaus threw his putter into the air after sinking the winning putt, as he was thrilled to have won the Open at the home of golf, St Andrews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nicklaus.com/nicklaus_facts/1970.php |title=Professional Highlights 1970 |publisher=Nicklaus.com |accessdate=November 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201200255/http://nicklaus.com/nicklaus_facts/1970.php |archivedate=December 1, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes this period in his life:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I was playing good golf, but it really wasn't that big a deal to me one way or the other. And then my father died and I sort of realized that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I sort of got myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint.&amp;nbsp;... It was a big boost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Soffian |first=Seth |url=http://www.nicklaus.com/design/oldcorkscrew/news_062606a.php |title=Nicklaus, Woods have major ties |publisher=News-Press |accessdate=November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nicklaus also went on to capture the [[Piccadilly World Match Play Championship]] in 1970 with a 2 &amp; 1 win over [[Lee Trevino]] in the championship match. In all for the year, Nicklaus competed in 23 official worldwide events, won four, placed in the top-5 10 times, and the top-10 in 14.

Although Nicklaus' performance had declined somewhat during this period, he was still ranked as the #1 player in the world, for 10 straight years, beginning in 1968, on the [[McCormack's World Golf Rankings]], which were introduced that year by sports agent [[Mark McCormack]]. These rankings, the first attempt to take into account results from professional tours around the world, were not official during that era, but they eventually evolved into the current [[Official World Golf Ranking]], starting in 1986.

===Resurgence (1971–1977)===
With his win in the [[1971 PGA Championship]], Nicklaus became the first golfer to win all four majors twice.&lt;ref name="Golf My Way"/&gt; In this championship, Nicklaus was the only player to break 70 consecutively in the first two rounds under windy conditions; he finished at seven-under par 281. Nicklaus finished second twice and fifth in the remaining three major championships for the year. While he finished tied for second in the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]] with [[Johnny Miller]], Nicklaus made a big enough impression on a young [[Nick Faldo]] (watching on TV in England) in order for Faldo to take up the game seriously.

By the end of 1971, Nicklaus had won four additional PGA tournaments including the [[Tournament of Champions (PGA Tour)|Tournament of Champions]] by eight shots and the [[National Team Championship]] with [[Arnold Palmer]] by six shots. With $244,490 in official PGA Tour earnings, Nicklaus established a new single-season money record during the year. Nicklaus also claimed his third [[World Cup (men's golf)|World Cup]] individual title in 1971, with help from a 63 in the third round. He also won the team competition with partner [[Lee Trevino]] by 12 shots. The year 1971 brought Nicklaus a victory in the Australian Dunlop International as well, punctuated by a course record 62 (his career low score in competition; one of three) in the second round. For the record, Nicklaus played in 23 official worldwide events in 1971, won eight, had 17 top-5 finishes, 20 top-10 finishes, and compiled a 5–1–0 record in that year's [[Ryder Cup]] competition.

Nicklaus won the first two major championships of 1972 by three shots each in wire-to-wire fashion. He won the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]] and the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], creating talk of a calendar-year [[Grand Slam (golf)|Grand Slam]]. Nicklaus opened with a four-under-par 68 at Augusta National and never looked back. He was the only player under par for the week as he and the field battled difficult scoring conditions. In the U.S. Open at [[Pebble Beach Golf Links|Pebble Beach]] again under severe scoring conditions, Nicklaus struck a one-iron on the 218-yard par-three 17th hole during the final round into a stiff, gusty ocean breeze that hit the flagstick and ended up three inches from the cup. The [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] was Nicklaus' 13th career major and tied him with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] for career majors (although a different group of tournaments had been considered majors in Jones's time). This victory was also Nicklaus' 11th professional major, tying him with [[Walter Hagen]], and made him the first player to win the U.S. Amateur and U.S. Open championships on the same golf course.

During the 1972 PGA Tour season, Nicklaus won seven tournaments and was runner-up in three events. However, Nicklaus did not win the Grand Slam that year, as [[Lee Trevino]] repeated as the Open Championship winner (Nicklaus finished second, one shot behind), and [[Gary Player]] prevailed in the [[PGA Championship]]. Nicklaus closed out this remarkable year with a second of three consecutive [[Walt Disney World Golf Classic]] victories by shooting a 21-under par 267 to win by nine shots. He concluded 1972 by competing in 20 official worldwide events winning seven, placing second in four, and compiling 15 top-10 finishes.

Bobby Jones' record of majors was soon broken when Nicklaus won the [[PGA Championship]] in August 1973 by four shots over [[Bruce Crampton]] for his 12th professional major (surpassing Hagen's mark of 11) and 14th overall when using the old-style configuration of Jones' day. In that year he won another six tournaments. When he won the 1973 Ohio King's Island Open, he became the first PGA Tour player to win a Tour event on a course that he designed himself. The [[PGA Player of the Year]] was awarded to Nicklaus for the third time, and the second year in a row. Nicklaus was also the first player to win over $300,000.00 in official money for a single season in 1972 at $320,542; he eclipsed that threshold again the following year with $308,362. The former total was $106,137 more than runner-up [[Lee Trevino]]. The latter total for the year 1973 catapulted Nicklaus over the $2&amp;nbsp;million career PGA Tour earnings mark, making him the first player to reach that milestone. Nicklaus teamed with [[Johnny Miller]] for another team title in the [[World Cup of Golf]], held in Spain. For the year, Nicklaus competed in 20 official worldwide events and claimed seven victories, 14 top-five finishes, 17 top-10s, and compiled a 4–1–1 record in that year's Ryder Cup competition.

Nicklaus' failure to win a major in 1974 was somewhat offset when he won the inaugural [[Tournament Players Championship]] and was named one of the 13 original inductees into the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldgolfhalloffame.org/jack-nicklaus/ |title=Jack Nicklaus in the World Golf Hall of Fame |publisher=World Golf Hall of Fame |accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicklaus said this honor was a "nice memento" after a "disappointing season".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nicklaus.com/nicklaus_facts/1974.php |title=Professional Highlights 1974 |publisher=Nicklaus.com |accessdate=November 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117083025/http://nicklaus.com/nicklaus_facts/1974.php |archivedate=January 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had no major championship victories in 1974, Nicklaus still achieved four top-10 finishes in the four events, three of which were in the top four, and placed second on the official money list behind [[Johnny Miller]]. While less than a stellar year, Nicklaus was able to claim two victories and 13 top-10 finishes in 20 official worldwide events.

Nicklaus started off well in 1975: he won the [[Doral-Eastern Open]], the [[Sea Pines Heritage Classic]], and the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]] in consecutive starts. His Masters win was his fifth, a record he was to break eleven years later. In this tournament, Nicklaus's {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} birdie putt on the 16th hole of the final round was a key in his victory over [[Tom Weiskopf]] and [[Johnny Miller]] in a riveting final-round battle. He also won the [[PGA Championship]] in August at [[Firestone Country Club]] by two shots over [[Bruce Crampton]] for his fourth win. Having won the Masters and PGA Championship, Nicklaus missed a playoff for the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] by two shots and a playoff for [[Open Championship]] by one shot. His performance in 1975 resulted in his being named [[PGA Player of the Year]] for the fourth time, tying [[Ben Hogan]], and he was also named [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] [[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]] Athlete of the Year. Nicklaus also captured his fourth Australian Open during the year. The year 1975 yielded Nicklaus six wins, 12 top-5 finishes, and 16 top-10 finishes in 18 official worldwide events.

Nicklaus placed first on the PGA Tour money list again in 1976, despite competing in only 16 events, winning just two ([[The Players Championship|Tournament Players Championship]] and [[World Series of Golf (PGA Tour)|World Series of Golf]]) – neither of them majors – and playing what he called "hang-back-and-hope golf".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nicklaus.com/nicklaus_facts/1976.php |title=Professional Highlights 1975 |publisher=Nicklaus.com |accessdate=November 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201200306/http://nicklaus.com/nicklaus_facts/1976.php |archivedate=December 1, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1976 Tournament Players Championship saw Nicklaus set a championship record of 19-under par 269 for his second win in this event which remained in place until [[Greg Norman]]'s 24-under-par 264 assault in 1994. He also won the PGA Player of the Year award for a record fifth time. Between 1972 and 1976 the only time he failed to win this award was 1974. The year 1976 also concluded an official streak of 105 consecutive cuts made on the PGA Tour (ending at the World Open), which began for Nicklaus in 1970. At the time this streak was second only to [[Byron Nelson]]'s record of 113.

The following year, 1977, was also majorless for Nicklaus, but he did achieve four top-10 finishes in the four events inclusive of two second and one third-place finish – this being one shot out of the [[PGA Championship]] playoff between [[Lanny Wadkins]] and [[Gene Littler]]. Despite a brilliant final round 66 at the Masters, he finished second by two shots to [[Tom Watson (golfer)|Tom Watson]]. But his subsequent second-place finish behind Watson at the Open Championship at [[Turnberry (golf course)|Turnberry]] created headlines around the world. In a one-on-one battle dubbed the "Duel in the Sun," Nicklaus shot 65-66 in the final two rounds, only to be beaten by Watson, who scored 65-65. This event marked the first time 270 was broken in a major championship, and the third-place finisher [[Hubert Green]] scored 279. Nicklaus would later say:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are those in golf who would argue into next month that the final two rounds of the 1977 British Open were the greatest head-to-head golf match ever played. Not having been around for the first five hundred or so years of the game, I'm not qualified to speak on such matters. What's for sure, however, is that it was the most thrilling one-on-one battle of my career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nicklaus.com/nicklaus_facts/1977.php |title=Professional Highlights 1977 |publisher=Nicklaus.com |accessdate=November 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117082859/http://nicklaus.com/nicklaus_facts/1977.php |archivedate=January 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1977, Nicklaus won his 63rd tour event, passing [[Ben Hogan]] to take second place on the career wins list, behind only [[Sam Snead]] (subsequently Hogan's official career PGA Tour victory total was put at 64, including his  1953 Open Championship which was retroactively deemed an official PGA Tour event). He also became the first player to amass over $3&amp;nbsp;million in official [[PGA Tour]] earnings. The year also saw Nicklaus win for the first time his own [[Memorial Tournament]], where he described the victory as the most emotional moment of his entire career, and nearly decided to retire from competitive golf.

====Proposes Ryder Cup modifications====
During the [[1977 Ryder Cup]] at Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes, Nicklaus approached the PGA of Great Britain about the urgency to improve the competitive level of the contest. The issue had been discussed earlier the same day by both past [[PGA of America]] President Henry Poe and [[Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain &amp; Ireland)|British PGA]] President Lord Derby. Nicklaus pitched his ideas, adding: "It is vital to widen the selection procedures if the [[Ryder Cup]] is to continue to enjoy its past prestige." The changes in team selection procedure were approved by descendants of the [[Samuel Ryder]] family, along with The PGA of America. The major change was expanding selection procedures to include players from the European Tournament Players' Division, and "that European Members be entitled to play on the team." This meant that professional players on the European Tournament Players' Division, the forerunner to the European Tour we have today, from continental Europe would be eligible to play in the Ryder Cup.

====Achieves triple career grand slam (1978)====
When Nicklaus won the [[1978 Open Championship]] at St. Andrews, he became the only player to win each major championship three times.&lt;ref name=open/&gt; This record was tied by [[Tiger Woods]] when he won the [[2008 U.S. Open (golf)|2008 U.S. Open]]. Nicklaus and Woods are the only two players to win three "Career Grand Slams". Nicklaus considered his performance in the 1978 Open as the finest four days of tee-to-green golf he had ever produced, and was most proud that the win came at St. Andrews, his favorite place to play golf. The victory was also his most emotional to date.

Nicklaus won three other tournaments on the [[PGA Tour]] in 1978. One of those wins came in the [[Jackie Gleason-Inverrary Classic]], where he played the final 36 holes 13 under par and scored five consecutive birdies over the closing holes in the final round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L6RHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Tf8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1460,4074304&amp;dq=grier+jones+jack+nicklaus&amp;hl=en |title=Nicklaus rally topples Jones |newspaper=The Morning Record and Journal |location=Meriden, Connecticut |agency=UPI |date=February 27, 1978 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also won his third [[Tournament Players Championship]] in difficult weather conditions; he had won three of the first five stagings of that tournament, and he remains the championship's only three-time winner. He was named [[Sportsman of the Year]] by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. The year 1978 also marked Nicklaus' sixth and final [[Australian Open (golf)|Australian Open]] victory.

===Short slump and revamping===
In 1979, Nicklaus suffered a lapse of form and did not win a tournament. This was the first year in his professional career in which he failed to win a PGA Tour event. He had only one runner-up finish, plus a tied-for-second with [[Ben Crenshaw]] behind 22-year-old [[Seve Ballesteros]] at [[The Open Championship]]. He would not win another tournament until June 1980. Previously, Nicklaus won at least one PGA Tour tournament per year (a record he shares with Arnold Palmer), and a minimum of two tournaments per year for 17 consecutive years, and this is another PGA Tour record.

During the offseason, Nicklaus addressed two problems that had hurt his performance. His lifelong teacher [[Jack Grout]] noticed that he had become much too upright with his full swing, which caused a steep, oblique approach into the ball, compared with a more direct hit; this was corrected by slightly flattening his backswing. Then Nicklaus' short game, never a career strength, was further developed with the help of [[Phil Rodgers]], a friend for more than 20 years, and earlier PGA Tour rival, who had become a fine coach. Rodgers lived for a time at the Nicklaus home while this work was going on.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;

===Wins fourth U.S. Open, fifth PGA Championship (1980)===
In 1980, Nicklaus recorded only four top-10 finishes in 14 events, but two of these were record-setting victories in majors (the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship); the other two were a tie for fourth in [[The Open Championship]] and a runner-up finish in the [[Doral-Eastern Open]] to [[Raymond Floyd]] via his chip-in birdie on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff. These victories and placements more than justified the work Nicklaus put in toward his game during the off-season.

Nicklaus set a new scoring record for the [[1980 U.S. Open (golf)|1980 U.S. Open]] with an aggregate of 272, eclipsing his earlier record of 275 from 1967 over the same golf course. That record, while since having been tied by three other players, stood until Rory McIlroy's 268 in winning the 2011 US Open. This was Nicklaus's second major win at [[Baltusrol Golf Club]]. Nicklaus opened with a record-tying 63 in round one and fought off his playing partner of all four rounds, 1978 [[Colgate World Match Play Championship]] winner, [[Isao Aoki]]. Entering the final round, Aoki had caught Nicklaus after three consecutive rounds of 68, but over the course of the last day, Nicklaus pulled away by two shots. Each player birdied the final two holes for a dramatic finish. Aoki's aggregate of 274 was the lowest score for a [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] runner-up. Nicklaus' win was his fourth and final victory in the championship, tying him with [[Willie Anderson (golfer)|Willie Anderson]], [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], and [[Ben Hogan]]. Nicklaus referred to this win as "by far the most emotional and warmest reaction to any of my wins in my own country".

In the [[1980 PGA Championship]], Nicklaus set another record when he won the tournament by seven shots over [[Andy Bean]] at the [[Oak Hill Country Club]]; the win was largely due to exceptional putting. Nicklaus shot an even-par 70 in the first round. This was followed by three successive rounds in the 60s over the difficult course, and he was the only player to break par for 72 holes. For the week, the field averaged 74.60 strokes while Nicklaus averaged 68.50. This was Nicklaus' fifth and final victory in the PGA Championship, which elevated him to record-holder for the most wins in the stroke-play era, and which tied him with [[Walter Hagen]] for the most wins overall, since Hagen's victories were all during the match-play era. Nicklaus' seven-shot winning margin remained the largest for the stroke-play version of the championship until Rory's McIroy's 2012 victory. This victory also made Nicklaus the only player since [[Gene Sarazen]] in 1922 and [[Ben Hogan]] in 1948 to win the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] and PGA Championship the same year (subsequently equaled by [[Tiger Woods]] in 2000).

===1981–1985===
Between 1981 and 1985, Nicklaus accumulated seven more top-10 placements in major championships, including three runner-up performances. He won only twice on the PGA Tour during this period, the [[Colonial National Invitation]] in 1982 and his own [[Memorial Tournament]] in 1984 for the second time, defeating Andy Bean in a sudden-death playoff to become the tournament's first repeat champion.

In 1983, Nicklaus closed out the [[PGA Championship]] and [[World Series of Golf]] with brilliant final rounds in the mid-60's, and passed many players to move into contention, but finished runner-up in each to [[Player of the Year]] [[Hal Sutton]] and [[Nick Price]], respectively, who dominated the tournaments from start to finish. Despite not winning a PGA Tour event in 1983, Nicklaus finished 10th on the PGA Tour money list, and passed a significant milestone by becoming the first player to eclipse the $4&amp;nbsp;million level in career earnings.

In 1985, Nicklaus finished second to [[Curtis Strange]] in the [[Canadian Open (golf)|Canadian Open]], which marked his seventh and final second-place finish in that tournament; this is a record for that event. These seven runner-up finishes came over the course of 21 events—or one second-place finish for every three tournaments played—and does not include a third-place finish in 1983, one shot out of the playoff between [[John Cook (golfer)|John Cook]] and [[Johnny Miller]].

During the five-year period between 1981 and 1985, the [[Ryder Cup]] matches provided Nicklaus with two bright spots. He completed his competition as a player in style by contributing a perfect 4–0–0 record (inclusive of a 5 &amp; 3 anchor singles match win over [[Eamonn Darcy]]) in 1981, and captained the United States team in 1983 to a one-point win over Europe.

===Wins sixth Masters at age 46 (1986)===
In 1986, Nicklaus capped his major championship career by winning his sixth Masters title under challenging circumstances; he posted a six-under-par 30 on the back nine for a final round of seven-under-par 65. At the 17th hole, Nicklaus hit his second shot to within {{convert|18|ft|m}} and rolled it in for birdie; he raised his putter in celebration and completed an eagle-birdie-birdie run. Nicklaus made a solid par-4 at the 72nd hole, and waited for the succeeding players, several of whom ([[Tom Kite]], [[Greg Norman]]) were still in contention, to fall short. Nicklaus played the final ten holes seven under par, with six birdies and an eagle. At age 46, Nicklaus became the oldest Masters winner in history, a record that still stands. On the feat, sports columnist [[Thomas Boswell]] remarked,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some things cannot possibly happen, because they are both too improbable and too perfect. The [[Miracle on Ice|U.S. hockey team cannot beat the Russians in the 1980 Olympics]]. Jack Nicklaus cannot shoot 65 to win The Masters at age 46. Nothing else comes immediately to mind.&lt;ref name="Quote"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Apfelbaum |editor-first=Jim |title=The Gigantic Book of Golf Quotations |year=2007 |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |isbn=978-1-60239-014-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This victory was his 18th and final major title as a professional.

This victory was to be his last in his long career on the PGA Tour, and was described at the time by noted golf historian and writer Herbert Warren Wind as "nothing less than the most important accomplishment in golf since [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]]' Grand Slam in 1930".

Author Ken Bowden wrote after the win:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There have been prettier swingers of the club than Jack Nicklaus. There may have been better ball-strikers than Jack Nicklaus. There have definitely been better short-game exponents than Jack Nicklaus. Other golfers have putted as well as Jack Nicklaus. There may have been golfers as dedicated and fiercely competitive as Jack Nicklaus. But no individual has been able to develop, combine and sustain all of the complex physical skills and the immense mental and emotional resources the game demands at its highest level as well as Jack Nicklaus has for as long as he has.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the [[1998 Masters Tournament|1998 Masters]], Nicklaus was 58 when he tied for sixth place despite being hampered by an ever-increasing painful left hip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Michaux |first=Scott |url=http://www.augusta.com/masters/stories/040305/pre_3693161.shtml |title=Langer sees time to wear third jacket |newspaper=The Augusta Chronicle |date=April 3, 2005 |accessdate=November 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728005755/http://www.augusta.com/masters/stories/040305/pre_3693161.shtml |archivedate=July 28, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicklaus' five-under par 283 is the lowest 72-hole score in the Masters by a player older than fifty.

During the course of a 25-year span (1962–1986), Nicklaus won 18 major championships and finished second 18 times (excluding the second-place finish at the [[1960 U.S. Open (golf)|1960 U.S. Open]] as an amateur). He also placed third nine times and fourth seven times in this span and was one stroke out of a playoff on five of those occasions ([[1963 Open Championship]], [[1967 PGA Championship]], [[1975 Open Championship]], [[1977 PGA Championship]], and [[1979 Masters Tournament]]). His total span of 73 top-10 finishes over 39 years (1960–1998) is a record in total number as well as longevity among the four major championships and encompassed his tenure from an amateur through the majority of his [[Champions Tour]] career.

==Senior golf career==
Nicklaus became eligible to join the [[Senior PGA Tour]], now known as PGA Tour Champions,&lt;!--The tour was known as the Senior PGA Tour throughout his career on that circuit. Name changed to Champions Tour in 2003, and PGA Tour Champions in 2016.--&gt; when he turned 50 in January 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicklaus.com/nicklaus_facts/1990.php |title=Professional Highlights 1990 |publisher=Nicklaus.com |accessdate=November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; at which point he declared, "I'm never satisfied. Trouble is, I want to play like me—and I can't play like me anymore."&lt;ref name="Quote"/&gt; He then quickly won in his first start on the Tour, [[The Tradition]], also a Senior Tour major championship. Nicklaus would go on to win another three Traditions—the final two in succession—while the most anyone else has won is two. [[File:JackNicklaus2006MastersPar3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Nicklaus walks up to his ball on the 9th hole of the par-3 course at Augusta National Golf Club during the 2006 par-3 contest.]]
Later in the year, Nicklaus won the [[Senior Players Championship]] by six shots over [[Lee Trevino]] for his second win of the year, and also his second major of the year by shooting a record 27-under par 261. The next year, in 1991, Nicklaus won three of the five events he started in, those being the [[U.S. Senior Open]] at Oakland Hills by firing a 65 in a playoff against [[Chi-Chi Rodríguez]] and his fine round of 69, the [[PGA Seniors Championship]] and [[The Tradition]] for the second year straight. These, again, were all majors on the senior circuit.

Nicklaus has won all the [[Senior major golf championships|senior majors]] with the exception of the [[Senior Open Championship]] (also known as the Senior British Open). However, he never played in that event until after he turned 60, and it was only elevated to a major in 2003. After a winless year in 1992, Nicklaus came back to win the U.S. Senior Open for the second time in 1993 by one shot over [[Tom Weiskopf]]. Also in that year he teamed up with Chi-Chi Rodríguez and [[Raymond Floyd]] to win the [[Wendy's 3-Tour Challenge]] for the Senior PGA Tour team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicklaus.com/nicklaus_facts/1993.php |title=Professional Highlights 1993 |publisher=Nicklaus.com |accessdate=November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Nicklaus won the Senior PGA Tour's version of the Mercedes Championship for his only win of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicklaus.com/nicklaus_facts/1994.php |title=Professional Highlights 1994 |publisher=Nicklaus.com |accessdate=November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tradition was his again in 1995, in a year where he made the top 10 in all of the seven tournaments he entered in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicklaus.com/nicklaus_facts/1995.php |title=Professional Highlights 1995 |publisher=Nicklaus.com |accessdate=November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 100th career win came the next year, when he won the Tradition for the fourth time, and second time in succession. He made a [[double eagle (golf)|double eagle]] in the final round. Nicklaus closed the final 36 holes with back-to-back seven-under par rounds of 65 to shoot a 16-under par 272 and win by three shots over [[Hale Irwin]]. This was to be his last win on the Senior PGA Tour, and the last official win of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicklaus.com/nicklaus_facts/1996.php |title=Professional Highlights 1996 |publisher=Nicklaus.com |accessdate=November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Close of playing career==
In [[2000 U.S. Open (golf)|2000]], Nicklaus played in his final [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]. He shot 73-82 and missed the cut at [[Pebble Beach Golf Links]]. This was the same tournament where Tiger Woods won his first Open when he outclassed the nearest competitors by a 15-shot margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.golf.com/golf/special/article/0,28136,1716703,00.html |title=Open and Shut |last=Garity |first=John |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=December 18, 2008 |date=June 26, 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603020018/http://www.golf.com/golf/special/article/0,28136,1716703,00.html |archivedate=June 3, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, he was paired with [[Tiger Woods]] and [[Vijay Singh]] in his final [[PGA Championship]] only a few days after the death of his 91-year-old mother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/grieving-nicklaus-plays-to-honour-wish-of-late-mother/article18425065/|title=Grieving Nicklaus plays to honour wish of late mother|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he missed the cut by one shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pga.com/pgachampionship/2005/news/pairings_challenge080905.html |title=The Pairings Challenge |accessdate=December 18, 2008 |last=Denney |first=Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicklaus.com/nicklaus_facts/majors.php |title=Major Championship Performances |publisher=Nicklaus.com |accessdate=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both tournaments, Nicklaus provided last-minute heroics by reaching the par-5 18th in two shots in the U.S. Open and nearly holing his wedge shot for eagle at the par-5 18th in the PGA Championship.

Nicklaus played without much preparation in the [[2005 Masters Tournament|2005 Masters]], a month after the drowning death of his 17-month-old grandson Jake (child of his son Steve) on March 1, 2005. In a written statement, Nicklaus said that it was impossible to put into words the devastation of his family. Nicklaus later spoke emotionally about the tragedy. He said: "It's been an overwhelmingly difficult and trying time for my entire family. The loss of our precious 17-month-old grandson Jake was devastating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/03/25/AR2005032503829.html |title=Nicklaus to Focus Attention on Family |newspaper=Washington Post |date=March 25, 2005 |accessdate=December 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicklaus and his son Steve played golf as therapy for their grief following Jake's death. After days of playing, Steve suggested his father return to [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]]. He made that his last appearance in the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Van Brimmer |first=Adam |url=http://www.augusta.com/masters/stories/040905/nicklaus.shtml |title=Golden Bear says goodbye |publisher=Morris News Service |date=April 9, 2005 |accessdate=November 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728005800/http://www.augusta.com/masters/stories/040905/nicklaus.shtml |archivedate=July 28, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2005, Nicklaus finished his professional career at [[The Open Championship]] played at [[Old Course at St Andrews|St Andrews]] on July 15, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/4645647.stm |title=Nicklaus set for St Andrews bow |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=November 11, 2007 |date=July 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; On St Andrews, Nicklaus stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm very sentimental and the place gets to me every time I go there. In May I walked around and welled up with hardly anyone watching me. St Andrews was always where I wanted to finish my major career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/4645647.stm |title=Nicklaus set for St Andrews bow |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nicklaus turned 65 in January that year, which was the last year he could enter The Open Championship as an exempt player. He played with [[Luke Donald]] and [[Tom Watson (golfer)|Tom Watson]] in his final round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/4687903.stm |title=Woods shines as Nicklaus bows out |work=BBC Sport   |accessdate=November 11, 2007 |date=July 15, 2005 |first=Matt |last=Slater}}&lt;/ref&gt; After hitting his tee shot off the 18th tee in the second round, Nicklaus received a ten-minute standing ovation from the crowd. On the eighteenth fairway, he gave his final farewell to professional golf while standing on the iconic [[Swilken Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pga.com/openchampionship/2010/news/swilcan-hof-071210.cfm |title=Swilcan Bridge replica a true World Golf Hall of Fame highlight |publisher=PGA of America |accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, Nicklaus ended his career with a birdie, holing a 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th green. Nicklaus missed the 36-hole cut with a score of +3 (147).&lt;ref name="GolfLegends"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.golflegends.org/jack-nicklaus.php |title=Jack Nicklaus Bio |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102202914/http://www.golflegends.org/jack-nicklaus.php |archivedate=November 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last competitive tournament in which Nicklaus played in the United States was the Champions Tour's [[Bayer Advantage Classic]] in [[Overland Park, Kansas]], on June 13, 2005.&lt;ref name="GolfLegends"/&gt;

On April 8, 2015, Nicklaus hit his first-ever [[hole-in-one]] at the Augusta National Golf Club at the age of 75 when participating in the Masters' Par 3 Contest, albeit on the Par 3 Course, while playing with [[Gary Player]] and [[Ben Crenshaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=75-Year-Old Jack Nicklaus Picks Up an Ace at 2015 Masters Par 3 Contest |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2424237-75-year-old-jack-nicklaus-picks-up-an-ace-at-2015-masters-par-3-contest |publisher=Bleacher Report |first=Kyle |last=Newport |date=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hit 20 holes-in-one in professional tournament play at other venues over his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facts and Figures |url=http://www.nicklaus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/facts.pdf |website=www.nicklaus.com |accessdate=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Off-the-course activities==

===Golf course design===
{{main article|Nicklaus Design}}

Nicklaus devotes much of his time to golf course design and operates one of the largest golf design practices in the world. In the mid-1960s, [[Pete Dye]] initially requested Nicklaus' opinion in the architecture process of The Golf Club in suburban Columbus, Ohio, and the input increased from that point forward. Nicklaus considered golf course design another facet of the game that kept him involved and offered a challenge. His first design, [[Harbour Town Golf Links]], co-credited with Dye, was opened for play in 1969.&lt;ref name="Design"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicklaus.com/design/ |title=Nicklaus Design |publisher=Nicklaus.com |accessdate=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nine-hole, par-3 golf course of Cheeca Resort &amp; Spa was also designed by Nicklaus in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/travel/cheeca-lodge-the-upper-keys-historic-hotspot-for-presidents/Gxpt4qOwKhZ0AQCHuwhfJK/ |title=Cheeca Lodge in the Upper Keys a historic hotspot for presidents |newspaper=Palm Beach Daily News |first=Cheryl |last=Blackerby |date=April 28, 2017 |access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.flkeysnews.com/news/business/article197012259.html |title=Cheeca to reopen March 30 |website=FLKeysNews.com |first=David |last=Goodhue |date=January 27, 2018 |access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandrakirkman/2015/01/31/the-perfect-valentines-day-weekend-escape-cheeca-lodge-spa-in-the-florida-keys/#5e4e07181bbc |title=The Perfect Winter Weekend Getaway: Cheeca Lodge &amp; Spa in the Florida Keys |last=Kirkman |first=Alexandra |magazine=[[Forbes]] |date=January 31, 2015 |access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent early, yet more prominent design was [[Muirfield Village]] Golf Club in Dublin, OH which opened in 1974 and has hosted the [[Memorial Tournament]] since its inception in 1976. This course has also hosted the 1987 [[Ryder Cup]] and the 1998 [[Solheim Cup]] matches. For the first few years, all of his projects were co-designs with either Pete Dye or [[Desmond Muirhead]], who were two of the leading golf course architects of that era.

His first solo design, [[Glen Abbey Golf Course]] in [[Oakville, Ontario]], opened for play in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.clublink.ca/golf/glenabbey/?SECT=GLENABBEY&amp;GOLF_COURSE_ID=0220 |title=Glen Abbey: Overview |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918193959/http://en.clublink.ca/golf/glenabbey/?SECT=GLENABBEY&amp;GOLF_COURSE_ID=0220 |archivedate=September 18, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This course served as the host site for the [[Canadian Open (golf)|Canadian Open]] for many years, the first being in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.clublink.ca/golf/glenabbey/?section_id=89&amp;SECT=GLENABBEY&amp;GOLF_COURSE_ID=0220 |title=RBC Canadian Open |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928045516/http://en.clublink.ca/golf/glenabbey/?section_id=89&amp;SECT=GLENABBEY&amp;GOLF_COURSE_ID=0220 |archivedate=September 28, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest golf club in the U.S, [[Saint Andrew's Golf Club]] in New York, was redesigned by Nicklaus in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintandrewsgolfclub.com/Golf.aspx |title=Golf |publisher=Saint Andrews Golf Club |date= |accessdate=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the King &amp; Bear opened in [[St. Augustine, Florida]], as a joint collaboration between Nicklaus and [[Arnold Palmer]]. In 2006, the Concession Golf Club opened in [[Sarasota]], Florida, as a joint collaboration between Nicklaus and [[Tony Jacklin]], to commemorate their historic Ryder Cup singles match in 1969.

Nicklaus is in partnership with his four sons and his son-in-law through their company, ''[[Nicklaus Design]]''. The company had 299 courses open for play at the end of 2005, which was nearly 1% of all the courses in the world (In 2005 ''Golf Digest'' calculated that there were nearly 32,000 golf courses in the world, approximately half of them in the United States.&lt;ref name="Design"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visiteurope.com/ccm/experience/detail/?nav_cat=134&amp;lang=en_US&amp;item_url=/ETC/pan-european/golf-in-europe.ja |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219050156/http://www.visiteurope.com/ccm/experience/detail/?nav_cat=134&amp;lang=en_US&amp;item_url=%2FETC%2Fpan-european%2Fgolf-in-europe.ja |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 19, 2007 |title=Golf in Europe |publisher=VisitEurope.com |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;). While the majority of Nicklaus-designed courses are located in the United States, the company has designed golf courses in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, and Mexico. For 2009, Nicklaus Design had 12 courses in ''Golf Digest'''s "75 Best Golf Resorts in North America". Past and present Senior Design Associates with Nicklaus Design include Chris Cochran,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicklaus.com/design/lionsgate/ |title=Lionsgate |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chet Williams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicklaus.com/design/dovemountainII/news033109.php |title=Ritz Carlton |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dave Heatwole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicklaus.com/design/thecliffs/ |title=The Cliffs |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings and media===
Nicklaus has written several golf instructional books, an autobiography (''My Story''), a book on his golf course design methods and philosophy, and has produced several golf videos. The writer Ken Bowden often assisted him with this work. His book ''Golf My Way'' is one of the all-time classics of golf instruction, and has been reissued several times since the initial printing in 1974. Nicklaus has also written golf instructional columns for ''[[Golf Magazine]]'' and for ''Golf Digest'' magazine, with which he is currently associated. He also appeared as a television analyst and commentator with [[ABC Sports]] on golf broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,317588,00.html |title=U.S. Open Preview |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |work=Entertainment Weekly }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the books have been reissued, sometimes under different titles, and ''My Story'' as a special high-quality limited edition for the 2000 [[Memorial Tournament]].

===Golf computer games===
Between 1988 and 1998, Nicklaus also gave his name to promote the successful ''Jack Nicklaus Golf'' computer game series developed by [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]]. Several of the golf courses he designed were incorporated into the fourth incarnation of the game ''[[Jack Nicklaus 4]]'' published in 1997. In addition, ''Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge'' by Activision was published in 1999.

===Other interests===
Nicklaus continues to manage the [[Memorial Tournament]], which he founded in his home state of Ohio. The event is played at [[Muirfield Village]], a course that he co-designed with [[Desmond Muirhead]] and opened in 1974. The course was officially dedicated on Memorial Day, May 27, 1974, with an exhibition match between Nicklaus and [[Tom Weiskopf]]. Nicklaus scored a six-under-par 66, which stood as the course record until 1979. The forerunner to this tournament, the Columbus Pro-Am, had its final year in 1975, and the inaugural Memorial Tournament was held the following year. The tournament is one of the more prestigious events on the PGA Tour.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;

Each year, the tournament selects one or more individuals as honorees who have made a significant impact to the game. The inaugural tournament in 1976 paid tribute to the late Bobby Jones, while the 25th edition in 2000 honored Nicklaus, himself. This concept was Nicklaus' idea as a contribution to perpetuating achievements of the game's greatest individuals. The honoree is selected by the Captain's Club, a group that acts independently of the tournament organization, but also advises on player invitations and the general conduct of the event. Members of the Captain's Club include [[Peter Alliss]], [[Peggy Kirk Bell]], [[George H.W. Bush]], [[Sean Connery]], [[Arnold Palmer]], and [[Gary Player]] among others.

The Memorial Tournament continues the [[PGA Tour]]'s philanthropic focus through its relationships with Central Ohio charities. The most significant of which is its relationship with [[Nationwide Children's Hospital]] since 1976. Contributions generated through the support of over 2,600 volunteers are distributed each year to the Hospital's unrestricted giving fund. This fund assists in ensuring Central Ohio continues to have one of the best children's hospitals in the United States. The Memorial Tournament has raised more than $5.7&amp;nbsp;million to support the programs and services at Nationwide Children's Hospital in those 30-plus years. In 2005 the Memorial made a pledge that will elevate its level of giving to more than $11&amp;nbsp;million in the coming years. Unique and successful relationships also exist with Fore Hope, James Cancer Hospital, Wolfe Associates, The First Tee, Central Ohio Junior Golf Association, Shriners, Lions Club and many more.

Nicklaus and wife Barbara serve as honorary chairman and active chairwoman of the Nicklaus Children's Health Care Foundation in North Palm Beach, Florida which provides valuable programs and services to more than 4,000 hospitalized children and their families, free of charge, through Child Life programs, the Pediatric Oncology Support Team, and the Safe Kids program. The Nicklauses established "The Jake", a pro-am golf tournament played annually at The Bear's Club in Jupiter, Florida in honor of their 17-month-old grandson who drowned in a hot tub in 2005. It has become the foundation's chief fundraiser. Players like [[Robert Allenby]], [[Raymond Floyd]], [[Tom Watson (golfer)|Tom Watson]], [[Ian Baker-Finch]], [[Ernie Els]], [[Jay Haas]], [[Johnny Miller]], and [[Gary Player]] have participated. No one accepts a fee. Everything goes to the foundation, more than $3&amp;nbsp;million over the past three years.

Nicklaus and retired General [[John Shalikashvili]], who served as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] from 1993 to 1997, are serving as honorary chairs for the [[American Lake Veterans Golf Course]] capital campaign in Tacoma, WA. The $4.5&amp;nbsp;million campaign in 2009 was established to complete the nation's only golf course designed for the rehabilitation of wounded and disabled veterans. The existing nine-hole course is operated, maintained, and managed by 160 volunteers. Funds are needed to add nine new holes and make other improvements to better accommodate demand from the growing influx of wounded veterans. A two-day event was held at [[Bighorn Golf Club]] at Palm Desert, CA featuring Nicklaus, who is donating his design services for the "Nicklaus Nine". In announcing his donation of services (valued at $500,000), Nicklaus said, "I was moved to see the amazing efforts at American Lake Veterans Golf Course where our wounded warriors learn to play golf with the help of an incredible army of volunteers." Monies raised during the campaign will be used to construct the new holes, complete the construction of the Rehabilitation and Learning Center, make improvements to the original holes to enhance accessibility, upgrade the maintenance facilities and restrooms, and help underwrite operational costs.

Nicklaus owns [[Nicklaus Golf Equipment]], which he founded in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manta.com/coms2/dnbcompany_649gsp |accessdate=December 22, 2008 |title=Nicklaus Golf Equipment Company Profile}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicklaus Golf Equipment manufactures equipment in three brands: Golden Bear, Jack Nicklaus Signature, and Nicklaus Premium. These brands are designed to target golfers at different stages of golfing ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicklaus-golf.com/index.html |title=Nicklaus Golf Equipment |accessdate=December 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also been known to reach out to younger golfers. One notable example came in 1984, when a teenage Canadian golfer who had previously met Nicklaus at an exhibition wrote him for career advice. The young golfer was right-handed but played left-handed; although he was showing considerable promise as a left-hander, he had been told that he might be an even better player if he switched to right-handed play. He wrote Nicklaus asking for advice; Nicklaus immediately wrote back telling him not to change if he was comfortable playing left-handed. The young Canadian, [[Mike Weir]], decided to stay with left-handed play, and eventually became a Masters champion. He still keeps Nicklaus' letter framed in his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Moment of Glory: The Year Underdogs Ruled Golf |last=Feinstein |first=John |authorlink=John Feinstein |year=2010 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |location=New York |isbn=0-316-02531-3 |pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicklaus lends his name and likeness to a line of flavored [[lemonade]]s from [[Arizona Beverage Company]], the same company that sells the [[Arnold Palmer (drink)|Arnold Palmer]] line of lemonade/iced tea blends.

In 2010, Nicklaus partnered with Terlato Wines to produce a collection of three [[Napa Valley AVA|Napa Valley]] wines: Jack Nicklaus Private Reserve (a red blend), Cabernet Sauvignon and Private Reserve White (a white blend).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ww2.terlatowines.com/wines/california/nicklaus/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216205656/http://ww2.terlatowines.com/wines/california/nicklaus/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 16, 2013 |title=Jack Nicklaus Wines: Overview |accessdate=January 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, Golden Bear Reserve, a Bordeaux-style red blend, was released to mark the 50th anniversary of Jack Nicklaus' first major championship victory, the 1962 U.S. Open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/42822 |title=Golf Legend Jack Nicklaus Introduces a Napa Cabernet |date=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing style==
During his prime, Nicklaus was consistently among the longest and straightest hitters on the [[PGA Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/8534978/ |title=Ball-striking |accessdate=December 23, 2008 |work=NBC Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; One early example was winning the official long drive contest at the [[1963 PGA Championship]] with a belt of 341 yards, 17&amp;nbsp;inches (312&amp;nbsp;meters). This record lasted more than 20 years. He preferred the fade (left-to-right shape) for his ball flight, since this allowed the ball to stop quickly on hard and fast greens. Another factor in this decision was his distance capabilities, which were developed enough to allow him to play a fade and still reach long par fours and par fives in two shots.&lt;ref name="Golf My Way"/&gt; Nicklaus considers his longest drive in competition to be during the final round of the [[1964 Masters Tournament|1964 Masters]] on the 15th hole, where he had less than 160 yards left to the 500 yard par five. He hit an eight-iron slightly over the green for his second shot.

As his career matured, he also developed the ability to hit the right-to-left controlled draw when needed. Nicklaus debuted as a young pro who hit the ball very high, but he could also hit lower-trajectory shots when needed, after gaining pro experience.

In 1968, [[IBM]] kept [[PGA Tour]] statistics for the first time, but did not continue this practice in the immediately subsequent years. Nicklaus led two categories for the 1968 season: he had an average driving distance of 275 yards, and hit 75 percent of greens in regulation; both marks were significantly ahead of rivals.&lt;ref&gt;''Golf Digest'' magazine, March 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though official [[PGA Tour]] statistics did not begin until 1980, Nicklaus was consistently the leader in greens hit in regulation through that year, displaying great command of the long and middle irons. Indeed, Nicklaus remained in the top six of this category through 1985 – far past his best playing years. Nicklaus also finished 10th in driving distance and 13th in driving accuracy in 1980 at age 40, which equated to a "Total Driving" composite of 23 – a statistical level not attained since, by a comfortable margin. Nicklaus led this category through 1982. One key to Nicklaus' ball-striking ability and overall power was his exceptional swing tempo. Of this [[Tom Watson (golfer)|Tom Watson]] referred to it as Nicklaus' greatest strength in its ability to remain smooth. This proved an asset, especially under pressure, which allowed him to obtain great distance control with his irons.

Nicklaus was also known for his course management skills. He would plan to hit each full shot to the optimal position, to best set up his next shot, usually aiming for level lies and clear approach lines, while favoring his preferred shot shapes. He would often hold back on power to achieve this, but had a power advantage over most rivals through the set, so that he could hit a 3-wood or 1-iron from the tee with increased accuracy to avoid trouble, with sufficient length to keep up with the drivers hit by most rivals. An exceptional example of this came in the final round of the 1966 Open Championship at Muirfield, on the 17th hole, a 530-yard par 5 hole. Nicklaus needed a birdie, but the hole was framed by tall fescue rough, and was playing downwind with very firm turf conditions. He used a 3-iron from the tee and hit the shot 290 yards, then hit a 5-iron 240 yards onto the green, two-putted for birdie, and parred the final hole to win the title.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;

Nicklaus was the first player to chart and document yardages on the course on a consistent, planned basis. For most of his career, he was not known for his skill on touch shots with the wedges, so he would often play to avoid wedge shots that needed less-than-full swings. [[Gary Player]] stated that Nicklaus had "the greatest mind the game has ever known".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/8534977/ |title=Course Management |accessdate=December 23, 2008 |work=NBC Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicklaus was not known for being an outstanding putter, but he was often able to make the important putts when they were needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/8534970/ |title=Putting |accessdate=December 23, 2008 |work=NBC Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicklaus' putting was highly regarded by his rivals. He was also known as a conservative player at times; he went for broke only when it was necessary. This was especially apparent on the greens, where he would often choose to be less aggressive and make sure of an easy two-putt. Nicklaus spoke about this in his autobiography. "I was a fine two-putter, but sometimes too defensive—too concerned about three-putting—to go for putts that I probably should have gone for."&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;

After his first year on the PGA Tour in 1962, Nicklaus received the [[PGA Tour Rookie of the Year|PGA Tour Rookie of the Year award]]. As well as receiving the [[PGA Tour Player of the Year]] five times and topping the PGA Tour money list eight times, he has also attained the [[Bob Jones Award]] and the [[Payne Stewart Award]], among others.

Nicklaus was inducted into the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]] in the inaugural class of 1974 and the [[Canadian Golf Hall of Fame]] in 1995. His likeness was featured on a special commemorative issue [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|five-pound note]] issued by the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], making him the first living person outside the [[Royal Family]] to appear on a British banknote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.rbs.com/media/news/press-releases/2005-press-releases/2005-07-12special-note.ashx |title=The Royal Bank of Scotland Group to Issue Special Commemorative £5 Note in Honour of Jack Nicklaus |date=July 12, 2006 |publisher=[[Royal Bank of Scotland Group]] |location=[[Edinburgh]] |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928065417/http://www.rbs.com/media/news/press-releases/2005-press-releases/2005-07-12special-note.ashx |archivedate=September 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbs.com/about-rbs/g2/heritage/our-banknote/banknote-history/banknote-issues.ashx |title=Our Banknotes: Learn more here about the banknotes we've issued since 1987 |date=September 17, 2009 |publisher=[[Royal Bank of Scotland Group]] |location=[[Edinburgh]] |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127182225/http://www.rbs.com/about-rbs/g2/heritage/our-banknote/banknote-history/banknote-issues.ashx |archivedate=January 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rampantscotland.com/letter2005b.htm |title=High Fives for Golden Bear |date=December 24, 2005 |publisher=Rampant Scotland |accessdate=October 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 he was on the six man short list for the [[BBC]]'s [[BBC Sports Personality of the Century|Sports Personality of the Century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/561352.stm |title=Ali crowned Sportsman of Century |date=December 13, 1999 |work=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Nicklaus was honored with the "Lombardi Award of Excellence" from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The award was created to honor Coach [[Vince Lombardi|Lombardi]]'s legacy, and is awarded annually to an individual who exemplifies the spirit of the Coach.

There is a [[Jack Nicklaus Museum]] on the campus of [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]] in his home town of [[Columbus, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicklausmuseum.org/ |title=Nicklaus Museum |publisher=NicklausMuseum.com |accessdate=November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was opened in 2002 and is a state-of-the-art, {{convert|24000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility offering a comprehensive view of Nicklaus' life and career in and out of golf as well as exhibits celebrating the history and legends of the game.

Nicklaus had the rare privilege of "dotting the 'i'" of "[[Script Ohio]]", the signature formation of [[the Ohio State University Marching Band]], at the Ohio State homecoming game on October 28, 2006 when the Buckeyes played Minnesota; this is considered the greatest honor that can be bestowed on a non-band member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2641971 |title=Strike up the band: Nicklaus dots 'i' at Ohio State |date=October 28, 2006 |agency=Associated Press |work=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicklaus was the fifth non-band member to receive this award. Other recipients include [[Bob Hope]] and [[Woody Hayes]]. While at Ohio State University, Nicklaus became a member of the Fraternity of [[Phi Gamma Delta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wmwoods.edu/Info.asp?3500 |title=Phi Gamma Delta |accessdate=November 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929133316/http://www.wmwoods.edu/Info.asp?3500 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Annika Sörenstam]], Nicklaus was named a Global Ambassador for the [[International Golf Federation]] in 2008 and was instrumental in bringing golf to the Olympics for the 2016 and 2020 games. Golf was last an Olympic sport at the 1904 Games in [[St. Louis]], Mo. when the United States and Canada were the only two competing countries. The [[International Olympic Committee]] approved the inclusion by a vote of 63–27, with two abstentions.

Nicklaus joined [[Arnold Palmer]] as an honorary starter for the 2010 Masters. Nicklaus became the eighth honorary starter since the tradition began in 1963 when Nicklaus won his first green jacket. The Big Three were once again reunited in Augusta for the 2012 Masters Tournament as [[Gary Player]] joined Palmer and Nicklaus to kickoff the 76th renewal of the major tournament.

[[File:Jack Nicklaus Congressional Gold Medal (front).jpg|thumb|200px|Congressional Gold Medal]]
Nicklaus, through his global reach in design and development, as well as the worldwide marketing and licensing of his golf and lifestyle brand, is atop ''Golf Inc.'' magazine's coveted list of the "Most Powerful People in Golf" for a record-extending sixth consecutive year. He is the only golf industry figure who has ever been named to the No. 1 spot for more than three years. Nicklaus topped the 2009 worldwide list of 35 individuals who were selected by a panel of editors for their ability to influence and impact the business of golf, be it the development of courses and communities, the operation of courses, the equipment used by golfers, or the rules and regulations of the game. ''Golf Inc.'' wrote that while the Golden Bear's reign at No. 1 is unprecedented, "the fact is that he keeps adding to his legend, at the design table and in the business world. Despite a worldwide course development slowdown, Nicklaus's design firm has over 40 courses in development around the globe...And he remains perhaps golf's most respected spokesperson on a wide range of issues."

On May 19, 2014, the [[United States House of Representatives]] voted to pass {{USBill|113|HR|2203}}, a bill that would award Nicklaus the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] "in recognition of his service to the nation in promoting excellence and good sportsmanship."&lt;ref name=2203sum&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 2203 - Summary |url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2203 |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill says that Nicklaus' "magnetic personality and unfailing sense of kindness and thoughtfulness have endeared him to millions throughout the world."&lt;ref name=MarcosAwardsCGM&gt;{{cite news |last=Marcos |first=Cristina |title=House votes to award medals to 'Monuments Men,' Jack Nicklaus |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/206578-house-votes-to-award-medals-to-monuments-men-jack-nicklaus |accessdate=May 20, 2014 |newspaper=The Hill |date=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Congressman [[Thomas Massie]] objected to a [[voice vote]], and demanded a [[roll call vote]].&lt;ref name="shesgreen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2014/06/15/congressman-thinks-answer/10565771/ |title=A congressman thinks 'no' is the answer |first=Deirdre |last=Shesgreen |date=June 15, 2014 |work=Cincinnati.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then tried to rally opposition to the measure, but the vote passed easily over Massie's objection: 371–10.&lt;ref name="shesgreen"/&gt;

*Most consecutive cuts made – 39 (1969 Masters – 1978 Open)
*Longest streak of top-10s – 13 (1973 Masters – 1976 Masters)
*At the Open Championship,1966–80, Nicklaus finished 15 consecutive years in the top-6. Specifically 1st (3), 2nd (6), 3rd (2), 4th (2), 5th (1), 6th (1).

'''Jaleleddin Farsi''' ({{lang-fa|جلال‌الدین فارسی}}) is an Iranian former politician who served as a member of the [[Iranian Parliament|parliament]] from 1984 to 1988. He was also elected to the 73-man [[Assembly of Experts for Constitution]] responsible for drafting the [[Constitution of Iran|constitution]] in 1979.

Farsi belonged to the [[Islamic Republican Party]]'s radical faction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sepehr Zabir|title=The Left in Contemporary Iran (RLE Iran D)|date=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-136-81263-7|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was its candidate for president in the [[Iranian presidential election, 1980|1980 election]], however he was replaced by [[Hassan Habibi]] after his [[Afghan]] origin was revealed (according to Article 115 of the constitution, president must be an Iranian citizen with Iranian origin).&lt;ref name="r"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adelkhah|first=Fariba|date=2015|series=Iranian Studies|volume=27|title=The Thousand and One Borders of Iran: Travel and Identity|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317418972|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moin1999"/&gt;

Before the [[Iranian Revolution]], Farsi was trained in guerilla techniques in [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="r"/&gt; He was a senior [[Islamic Coalition Party|Islamic Coalition]] member and maintained ties to [[Fada'iyan-e Islam]].&lt;ref name="Moin1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Baqer Moin|title=Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah|year=1999|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-85043-128-2|pages=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Murder case==
In 1992, Farsi killed a farmer in [[Taleqan]] during an argument. Four years later he was reportedly sentenced to the death penalty by the court of law. The case has never been cleared up.&lt;ref name="r"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Iranian politician condemned to death|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1996/02/01/Iranian-politician-condemned-to-death/1599823150800/|date=1 February 1996|access-date=2 November 2017|work=United Press International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre of Javanese culture and politics was moved towards the eastern part of the island when [[Mpu Sindok]] (r. 929-947) moved the capital of the kingdoms eastward to the valleys of the [[Brantas River]] in the 10th century CE. The move was most likely caused by the [[volcanic eruption]] of [[Mount Merapi|Merapi]] and/or invasion from [[Srivijaya]].&lt;ref name=survey /&gt;{{rp|238–239}}

Singhasari dominance was cut short in 1292 by Kediri's rebellion under [[Jayakatwang]], killing Kertanegara. However, Jayakatwang's reign as king of Java soon ended as he was defeated by Kertanegara's son-in-law, [[Raden Wijaya]] with the help of [[Mongol invasion of Java|invading Mongol troops]] in March 1293.

[[Raden Wijaya]] would later establish [[Majapahit]] near the delta of the Brantas River in modern-day [[Mojokerto]], [[East Java]]. Kertanegara policies were later continued by the [[Majapahit]]s under King [[Hayam Wuruk]] and his minister [[Gajah Mada]].&lt;ref name=handbook /&gt;

Aside from its power over Javanese city-states, it also gained overlordship of the ports of [[Jambi]] and [[Palembang]] in eastern Sumatra.&lt;ref name="Suma"/&gt; Demak played a major role in opposing the newly arrived colonial power, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. Demak twice attacked the Portuguese following their capture of [[Malacca]]. They also attacked [[Luso Sundanese padrão|the allied forces]] of the Portuguese and the [[Sunda Kingdom]], establishing in the process the [[Sultanate of Banten]].

Demak was succeeded by the [[Kingdom of Pajang]] and finally the [[Mataram Sultanate|Sultanate of Mataram]]. The centre of power moved from coastal Demak, to Pajang in Blora, and later further inland to Mataram lands in [[Kotagede]], near present-day [[Yogyakarta]]. The Mataram Sultanate reached its peak of power and influence during the reign of [[Sultan Agung of Mataram|Sultan Agung Hanyokrokusumo]] between 1613 and 1645.

=== Colonial Java ===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM 'Het veertig-jarig regeringsjubileum van Soesoehoenan Pakoe Boewono X van Surakarta in de stoet lopen serimpi's mee' TMnr 10001563.jpg|thumb|right|A Javanese courtly ceremony at Keraton Surakarta in 1932.]]

In 1619 the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] established their trading headquarter in [[Jakarta|Batavia]]. Java slowly fell to the [[Dutch East India Company]], which would also eventually control most of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. The internal intrigue and war of succession, in addition to Dutch interference, caused the Mataram Sultanate to break up into [[Surakarta Sunanate|Surakarta]] and [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Yogyakarta]]. The further separation of the Javanese realm was marked by the establishment of the [[Mangkunegaran]] and [[Pakualaman]] princedom. Although the real political power in those days actually lay with the colonial Dutch, the Javanese kings, in their [[keraton]]s, still held prestige as the supposed power centre of the Javanese realm, especially in and around Surakarta and Yogyakarta.

Dutch rule was briefly interrupted by [[United Kingdom|British]] rule in the early 19th century. While short, the British administration led by [[Stamford Raffles]] was significant, and included the re-discovery of [[Borobudur]]. Conflict with foreign rule was exemplified by the [[Java War]] between 1825 and 1830, and the leadership of Prince [[Diponegoro]].

Like the rest of the [[Dutch East Indies]], Java was captured by the [[Empire of Japan]] during [[World War II]]. With Japan's defeat, independence was proclaimed in the new [[Republic of Indonesia]].

===Republic of Indonesia===
When the Indonesian independence was proclaimed on 17 August 1945, the last sovereign Javanese monarchies, represented by the Sri Sultan of [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Yogyakarta]], the Sunanate of [[Surakarta Sunanate|Surakarta]] and Prince of Mangkunegara declared that they would become part of the Republic of Indonesia.

Yogyakarta and Pakualam were later united to form the Yogyakarta Special Region. The Sri sultan became Governor of Yogyakarta, and the Prince of Pakualaman became vice-governor; both were responsible to the President of Indonesia. The Special Region of Yogyakarta was created after the war of independence ended and formalised on 3 August 1950. Surakarta was later absorbed as part of the Central Java province.

{{main article|Javanese culture}}
{{See also|Javanese dance|Javanisation}}
[[File:Wayang Performance.jpg|thumb|right|Javanese cultural expressions, such as [[wayang]] and [[gamelan]] are often used to promote the excellence of Javanese culture.]]
The [[Javanese culture]] is one of the oldest civilisations and has flourished in Indonesia. It has gradually absorbed various elements and influences from other cultures, including native reverence for ancestral and natural spirits, [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] dharmic civilisation, Islamic values, and to a lesser extent, Christianity, Western philosophy and modern ideas. Nevertheless, Javanese culture — especially in the Javanese cultural heartland; those of highly polished aristocratic culture of the ''[[keraton]]s'' in [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]] — demonstrates some specific traits, such as particular concern with elegance and refinement (Javanese: ''alus''), subtlety, politeness, courtesy, indirectness, emotional restraint and consciousness to one's social stature. Javanese culture values harmony and social order highly, and abhors direct conflicts and disagreements. These Javanese values are often promoted through Javanese cultural expressions, such as [[Javanese dance]], [[gamelan]], [[wayang]] and [[batik]]. It is also reinforced through adherence to Javanese ''adat'' (traditional rules) in ceremonies, such as ''[[Slametan]], [[Satu Suro]]'', Javanese weddings and ''[[Naloni Mitoni]]''.

However, the culture of ''pesisiran'' of Javanese north coast and in Eastern Java demonstrates some slightly different traits. They tend to be more open to new and foreign ideas, more egalitarian, and less conscious of one's social stature. Some of these northern settlements — such as Demak, Kudus, Tuban, Gresik and Ampel in Surabaya — have become more overtly Islamic, traditionally because these port towns are among the earliest places that Islamic teachings gained foothold in Java.
[[File:Gamelan Player 1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Gamelan]] is one of Javanese cultural expression that demonstrate refinement.]]
Javanese culture is traditionally centred in the [[Central Java]], [[Yogyakarta]] and [[East Java]] provinces of Indonesia. Due to various migrations, it can also be found in other parts of the world, such as [[Suriname]] (where 15% of the population are of Javanese descent), the broader Indonesian archipelago region,&lt;ref name=srilankan&gt;{{Cite book | last = Shucker | first = M.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a public poll held [[circa]]-1990, approximately 12% of Javanese used [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], around 18% used both Javanese and Indonesian, and the rest used Javanese exclusively.

The Javanese language was formerly written with a script descended from the [[Brahmi script]], natively known as ''Hanacaraka'' or ''Carakan''. Upon Indonesian independence it was replaced with a form of the [[Latin alphabet]].
[[File:Javanese commoner and Javanese warrior.jpg|thumb|270x270px|An image of Javanese commoner and Javanese warrior, from Homann's map of Batavia, 1733.]]
While Javanese was not made an [[official language]] of Indonesia, it has the status of regional language for communication in the Javanese-majority regions. The language also can be viewed as an ethnic language because it is one of the defining characteristics of the Javanese ethnic identity.&lt;ref name=dict /&gt;

===Literature and philosophy===
{{main article|Javanese literature|Javanese poetry}}
Javanese intellectuals, writers, poets and men of letters are known for their ability to formulate ideas and creating [[idiom]]s for high cultural purpose, through stringing words to express a deeper philosophical meanings. Several philosophical idioms sprung from Javanese classical literature, [[Javanese historical texts]] and oral traditions, and have spread into several media and promoted as popular [[motto]]s. For example, ''"[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]"'', used as the national motto of the [[Republic of Indonesia]], ''"Gemah Ripah Loh Jinawi, Toto Tentrem Kerto Raharjo"'', ''"Jer Basuki Mawa Bea"'', ''"Rawe-Rawe rantas, Malang-Malang putung"'' and ''"[[Tut Wuri Handayani]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The [[United States|American]] [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Clifford Geertz]] divided in the 1960s the Javanese community into three ''aliran'' or "streams": [[santri]], [[abangan]] and [[priyayi]]. According to him, the Santri followed an orthodox interpretation [[Islam]], the abangan followed a syncretic form of Islam that mixed Hindu and animist elements (often termed ''[[Kejawen]]''), and the priyayi were the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = McDonald  | first = Hamish  | title = Suharto's Indonesia  | publisher = Fontana  | year = 1980  | location = Melbourne  | pages = 9–10  | isbn = 0-00-635721-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Geertz opinion is often opposed today because he mixed the social groups with belief groups. It was also difficult to apply this social categorisation in classing outsiders, for example other non-[[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] Indonesians such as persons of [[Arab Indonesian|Arab]], [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]] and [[India]]n descent.

Social stratification is much less rigid in northern coast area.

===Calendar===
{{main article|Javanese calendar}}

The Javanese [[calendar]] is used by the Javanese people concurrently with two other calendars, the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the [[Islamic calendar]]. The Gregorian calendar is the official calendar of Indonesia, while the Islamic calendar is used by Muslims and Indonesian government for religious worship and deciding relevant [[Islamic holidays]]. The Javanese calendar is presently used mostly for cultural events (such as [[Satu Sura|Siji Surå]]). The Javanese calendar system is currently a lunar calendar adopted by [[Sultan Agung]] in 1633, based on the Islamic calendar. Previously, Javanese people used a solar system based on the [[Hindu calendar]].

Unlike many other calendars, the Javanese calendar uses a 5-day week known as the ''[[Javanese calendar#Five-day week (Pasaran)|Pasaran]]'' cycle. This is still in use today and is superimposed with 7-day week of the [[Gregorian calendar]] and [[Islamic calendar]] to become what is known as the 35-day [[Javanese calendar#Wetonan cycle|Wetonan cycle]].

===Architecture===
{{main article|Javanese traditional house}}
[[File:RUMAHJAWA 1.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional Javanese house.]]
Throughout their long history, the Javanese have produced many important buildings, ranging from Hindu monuments, Buddhist [[stupa]], mortuary temples, palace complexes, and mosques.

Two important religious monuments are the Hindu temple of [[Prambanan]] and the Buddhist temple of [[Borobudur]]. Both of them are 9th century temples and [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s. Both are located near [[Yogyakarta]] in the slope of Mount Merapi.

Meanwhile, examples of secular buildings can be seen in the ruins of the former capital city of the [[Majapahit]] Kingdom (14th to 16th century AD) in [[Trowulan]], [[East Java]]. The complex covers an area of 11&amp;nbsp;km x 9&amp;nbsp;km. It consists of various brick buildings, a canal ranging from 20 to 40 meters wide, purification pools, temples and iconic split gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== Names ===
{{main article|Javanese names}}

Javanese do not usually have family names or surnames, with only a single name. Javanese names may come from traditional Javanese languages, many of which are derived from [[Sanskrit]]. Names with the prefix ''Su-'', which means ''good'', are very popular. After the advent of Islam, many Javanese began to use [[Arabic]] names, especially coast populations, where Islamic influences are stronger. Commoners usually only have one-word names, while nobilities use two-or-more-word names, but rarely a surname. Some people use a [[patronymic]]. Due to the influence of other cultures, many people started using names from other languages, mainly [[European languages]]. [[Christian]] Javanese usually use [[Latin]] [[baptism]] names followed by a traditional Javanese name.

==Occupations==
In Indonesia, Javanese people can be found in all occupations, especially in the government and the military.

===Farming===
Traditionally, most Javanese people are farmers. Farming is especially common because of the fertile volcanic soil in Java. The most important agricultural commodity is rice. In 1997, it was estimated that Java produced 55% of Indonesia's total output of the crop.&lt;ref name=agri&gt;{{Cite book

[[Cetbang]], the Javanese bronze breech-loaded swivel-gun, was used ubiquitously by the Majapahit navy, pirates, and rival lords. The demise of the [[Majapahit]] empire also caused the flight of disaffected skilled bronze cannon-smiths to [[Brunei]], modern [[Sumatra]] and [[Malaysia]], and the [[Philippines]]. This led to near universal use of the swivel-gun, especially on trade vessels to protect against pirates, in the [[Makassar Strait]].&lt;ref name="Thomas Stamford Raffles 1965"&gt;Thomas Stamford Raffles, ''The History of Java'', Oxford University Press, 1965, {{ISBN|0-19-580347-7}}, 1088 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Javanese art of wood carving is traditionally applied to various cultural attributes such as statues, (wayang-)dolls, and masks. Woodcarving also prominent as house ornamentation and details. The elaborately carved Omah Kudus is a fine example of Javanese woodcarving mastery.

Since the Hindu kingdom period, Javanese [[merchant]]s settled at many places in the Indonesian archipelago.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt;{{rp|247}} In the late 15th century, following the collapse of Majapahit and the rise of Muslim principalities on the northern coast of Java, many Hindu nobilities, artisans and courtiers migrated to [[Bali]],&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{Cite book

In the conflicts during the transitions of power between the [[Sultanate of Demak|Demak]], the [[Kingdom of Pajang|Pajang]] and the [[Sultanate of Mataram|Mataram]] in the late 16th century, some Javanese migrated to [[Palembang]] in southern [[Sumatra]].

During the reign of [[Sultan Agung of Mataram|Sultan Agung]] (1613–1645), some Javanese began to establish settlements in coastal [[West Java]] around [[Cirebon]], [[Indramayu]] and [[Karawang]]. These Javanese settlements were originally commissioned by Sultan Agung as rice farming villages to support the Javanese troop logistics on his military campaign against Dutch Batavia.

The Javanese were also present in [[Peninsular Malaysia|Peninsular Malaya]] since early times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Migration also took place from 1880 to 1930 from other parts of Java with a secondary migration Javanese from Sumatra. Those migrations were to seek a new life away from the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonists]] who ruled Indonesia at that time. Today these people live throughout Peninsular Malaysia and are mainly concentrated in parts of [[Johor]], [[Perak]] and [[Selangor]] and cities such as [[Kuala Lumpur]]. 
Today, the Javanese in Malaysia are included in [[Malay race]] along with other native Indonesian ethnics, it is estimated 40% of all Malays in Malaysia at least has some Javanese ancestry.

In Singapore, approximately 50-60% of [[Malays in Singapore|its Malay population]] have some degree of Javanese ancestry.

[[File:Tropenmuseum Royal Tropical Institute Objectnumber 60006744 Javaanse arbeiders aangekomen bij de.jpg|thumb|Javanese migrant workers in Suriname, circa 1940.]]
New migration patterns emerged during colonial periods. During the rise of [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] power starting in the 17th century, many Javanese were exiled, enslaved or hired as mercenaries for the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colonies]] of [[Ceylon]] in [[South Asia]] and the [[Cape colony]] in [[South Africa]]. These included princes and nobility who lost their dispute with the Company and were exiled along with their retinues. These, along with exiles from other ethnicities like [[Bugis]] and [[Malay people|Malay]] became the [[Sri Lankan Malay]]&lt;ref name=srilankan/&gt; and [[Cape Malay]]&lt;ref name=cape/&gt; ethnic groups respectively. Other political prisoners were transported to closer places. Prince [[Diponegoro]] and his followers were transported to [[North Sulawesi]], following his defeat in [[Java War]] in the early 19th century. Their descendants are well known as [[Jatons|Jaton]] (abbreviation of "Jawa Tondano"/Tondano Javanese).

Major migrations started during the Dutch colonial period under [[Transmigration program]]s. The Dutch needed many labourers for their plantations and moved many Javanese under the program as contract workers, mostly to other parts of the colony in Sumatra. They also sent Javanese workers to [[Suriname]] in South America. Today approximately 15% of the Suriname population is of Javanese ancestry.

The Transmigration program that was created by the Dutch continued following independence. A significant Javanese population can be found in the Jabodetabek ([[Greater Jakarta]]) area, [[Lampung]], [[South Sumatra]] and [[Jambi]] provinces. Several ''paguyuban'' (traditional community organisation) were formed by these Javanese immigrants, such as "Pujakesuma" (abbreviation of Indonesian: ''Putra Jawa Kelahiran Sumateran'' or Sumatra-born Javanese).

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1979–1985) ===
Following his release from the Dallas Cowboys, Neidhart traveled to [[Calgary]] to train with [[Stu Hart]] and pursue a career in professional wrestling.&lt;ref name=slamaug14/&gt; He worked for Hart's [[Stampede Wrestling]] from 1978 to 1983, and again in 1985, during which time he married Ellie Hart, one of Stu's daughters.&lt;ref name="thief"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/02/05/921693.html |title=Neidhart accused of theft |first=Kevin |last=Martion |publisher=Calgary Sun |accessdate=July 9, 2007 |date=February 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a two-time Stampede International Tag Team Champion, with [[Hercules Ayala]] in 1980 and [[Mr. Hito]] in 1983. Stu Hart, seeking publicity for Neidhart, promised him $500 to enter and win an [[anvil]] toss at the [[Calgary Stampede]]. He did, throwing it 11 feet, 2 inches. This earned him the nickname "The Anvil", replacing his prior nickname, "The Animal".&lt;ref name=defino/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/05/03/pf-4151140.html|title=Neidhart-Santana ready to renew rivalry|author=Patton, Kristi|publisher=Cochrane Times|date=May 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stampede had a working relationship with [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]], and Neidhart worked on their Big Fight Series tour in 1982, the New Year Golden Series in 1983 and two shows on March 2 and 3, 1984.&lt;ref name=Neidplaces&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=bios&amp;wrestler=433&amp;bild=1&amp;details=7|title=Wrestlingdata.com - The World's Largest Wrestling Database|first=Axel|last=Saalbach|website=www.wrestlingdata.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neidhart teamed twice with [[King Kong Bundy]] for [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] in 1983 and worked for [[Mid-South Wrestling]] from September till February 1984, where he and [[Butch Reed]] held the [[Mid-South Tag Team Championship]] for two and a half months.&lt;ref name=Neidplaces/&gt; From April to August 1984, Neidhart worked for the [[Continental Wrestling Association]]. He then left for [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]], winning their versions of the NWA Southern Heavyweight and NWA United States Tag Team Championship, before leaving for the WWF in January 1985.&lt;ref name=Neidplaces/&gt;

=== World Wrestling Federation ===

==== The Hart Foundation (1985–1991) ====
{{Main|The Hart Foundation#The Hart Foundation|l1=The Hart Foundation}}
When Stu Hart sold Stampede Wrestling to [[Vince McMahon]], owner of the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), Neidhart and Bret Hart were included in the deal. Initially a singles wrestler, managed by [[Mr. Fuji]], Neidhart debuted on January 21, 1985, in [[Madison Square Garden]], defeating [[Tony Garea]].&lt;ref name=Neidmatch/&gt; He wrestled Hart, who had a cowboy gimmick, to a draw twice. Bret, upset with his gimmick, suggested to McMahon that he form a tag team with Neidhart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hart, Bret|title=Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling|publisher=Random House of Canada|date=February 24, 2009|isbn=0307371468|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Hart Foundation Tag Team.jpg|thumb|left|upright|"[[The Hart Foundation]]" Neidhart (back) and [[Bret Hart]] (front), {{circa|1980s}}]]
The new team was dubbed The Hart Foundation and was managed by [[Jimmy Hart]] (no relation to Bret). They made their [[pay-per-view]] debut at [[WrestleMania 2]], where they were the last two eliminated from a 20-man [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] by [[André the Giant]].&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt; The Hart Foundation won their first [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championship]] on the February 7, 1987 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars]]'' (taped January 26) from [[The British Bulldogs]] ([[Davey Boy Smith]] and [[The Dynamite Kid]]), with the help of [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] [[Dan Marsh|Danny Davis]], who was continually "distracted" by checking on Dynamite (laid out of the match early by a megaphone shot from Jimmy), allowing the challengers to double-team Smith.&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt; Davis was subsequently fired as referee and began wrestling, aligned with The Hart Foundation. They lost the belts on the November 7 episode of ''[[Prime Time Wrestling]]'' (taped October 27), to [[Strike Force (professional wrestling)|Strike Force]] ([[Rick Martel]] and [[Tito Santana]]).&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt;

The Hart Foundation wrestled in another 20-man battle royal at [[WrestleMania IV]]. [[Bad News Brown]] attacked and eliminated Hart to win. Neidhart eventually joined Bret's side in the feud with Brown causing a rift between the team and manager Jimmy Hart. This led them to fire him and before starting a feud with [[The Fabulous Rougeaus|The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers]]. In the fall of 1988, Jimmy Hart began managing the Rougeaus. The Hart Foundation unsuccessfully challenged [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] ([[Bill Eadie|Ax]] and [[Barry Darsow|Smash]]) for the tag title at [[SummerSlam (1988)|the 1988 SummerSlam]], when Ax hit Hart with Jimmy Hart's megaphone for the pin (Hart accompanied Demolition's manager, Mr. Fuji, solely to further his feud with the challengers).&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt; The Hart Foundation continued feuding with Jimmy Hart's wrestlers for the next year, teaming with [[Jim Duggan]] to defeat [[Dino Bravo]] and The Rougeaus in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Series variations|2/3 falls match]] at the [[Royal Rumble (1989)|1989 Royal Rumble]], then defeating [[The Honky Tonk Man]] and [[Greg Valentine]] at [[WrestleMania V]].&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt;

In April 1989, both Hart Foundation members began wrestling singles matches at [[house shows]]. Neidhart also had a few shots at [[Rick Rude|Ravishing Rick Rude]]'s [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]] in August.&lt;ref name=Neidmatch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=bios&amp;wrestler=433&amp;bild=1&amp;details=11|title=Wrestlingdata.com - The World's Largest Wrestling Database|first=Axel|last=Saalbach|website=www.wrestlingdata.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hart Foundation reformed full-time on March 24 in [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name=Neidmatch/&gt; At [[WrestleMania VI]] in [[Toronto]], they defeated [[The Bolsheviks]] ([[Nikolai Volkoff]] and [[Jim Barrell|Boris Zhukov]]) in 19 seconds. They started a second feud with champions Demolition, who at this point added [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]].&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt; At [[SummerSlam (1990)|SummerSlam 90]] on August 27, The Hart Foundation won the title for a second time in a 2/3 falls match.&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt;

On October 30, 1990, [[The Rockers]] ([[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Marty Jannetty]]) defeated The Hart Foundation in a two out of three falls match in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]], to seemingly win the title. During the match, the top rope broke by accident, and the match did not air on television.&lt;ref name="Phantom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm |title=WWF Show Results 1990 |accessdate=July 13, 2007 |date=October 30, 1990 |author=Graham Cawthon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rockers defended the WWF Tag Team title against [[Power and Glory]] ([[Paul Roma]] and [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]]) on November 3, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm |title=WWF Show Results 1990 |accessdate=July 13, 2007 |date=November 3, 1990 |author=Graham Cawthon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after November 3, the WWF decided to not air the title change and that the title would revert to the Hart Foundation. In his book, Shawn Michaels claims that the Hart Foundation had politicked to keep the title.&lt;ref name="HBKBOOK"&gt;{{cite book |last=Michaels |first=Shawn |authorlink=Shawn Michaels |author2=Feigenbaum, Aaron |title=Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: the Shawn Michaels Story |edition=paperback |date=November 7, 2006 |publisher=[[WWE Books]] |location=Hartford, CN |isbn=978-1-4165-1686-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WWF has never officially recognized The Rockers' reign.&lt;ref name="sportingnews"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Remembering the winding, entertaining and storied career of Jim 'The Anvil' Neidhart |last=Keith|first=Scott|work=[[Sporting News]] |date=August 12, 2018 |accessdate= August 13, 2018|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/us/wwe/news/jim-neidhart-dead-death-cause-of-death-age-hart-foundation-career-biography/19tnwrxvjq7zj1iqwg4w77zhqg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hart Foundation reigniting their feud with Jimmy Hart via his team, [[Rhythm and Blues (professional wrestling)|Rhythm and Blues]] (Honky Tonk and Valentine). Jimmy Hart once again cost The Hart Foundation the belts at [[WrestleMania VII]], in a match with his new team, [[The Nasty Boys]] ([[Brian Knobs]] and [[Jerry Sags]]), when he distracted the referee, allowing Sags to knock out Neidhart with his motorcycle helmet.&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt; Hart and Neidhart again split up, though they reunited for a title rematch with The Nasty Boys on the July 29 ''Prime Time Wrestling'', losing by disqualification when Bret hit both champions with a helmet, again introduced by Jimmy Hart. Neidhart also commentated on ''[[Wrestling Challenge]]'' alongside [[Gorilla Monsoon]] and [[Bobby Heenan]] from March until August 1991.

==== The New Foundation (1991–1992) ====
{{Main|The Hart Foundation#The New Foundation|l1=The New Foundation}}
He returned to TV action on the November 9 edition of ''Superstars of Wrestling'' against [[Ric Flair]], who continued to apply his figure-four leglock after winning the match, beginning a series of Flair vs Neidhart matches that have continued into a second generation. While hobbling away to the back, he was attacked and further injured by [[The Beverly Brothers]].&lt;ref name=wwe91&gt;{{cite web|title=Ring Results: 1991|publisher=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm|accessdate=2018-08-15|first=Graham|last=Cawthon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was thus replaced in the [[Survivor Series 1991|1991 Survivor Series]] by [[Sgt. Slaughter]] (who became the team captain).

He returned on the December 1 edition of ''[[Wrestling Challenge]]'', teaming with [[Owen Hart]] (Bret's younger brother) as The New Foundation, defeating [[Barry Horowitz]] and [[Gillberg (wrestler)|Duane Gill]].&lt;ref name=wwe91/&gt; Clad in bright [[parachute pants]] with checkerboard designs, The New Foundation's highlight was a win over [[The Orient Express]] ([[Paul Diamond|Kato]] and [[Pat Tanaka|Tanaka]]) at the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|1992 Royal Rumble]]. Aside from one match against The Barbarian and Warlord, they wrestled The Beverly Brothers exclusively at house shows in 1992. He was fired on February 16, 1992 after refusing to take a drug test and throwing a television monitor backstage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hart, Bret|title=Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling|publisher=Random House of Canada|date=February 24, 2009|isbn=0307371468|page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ECW, New Japan and WCW (1992–1993) ===
After three matches in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Wrestling]] (ECW), Neidhart had three tours with [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] in 1992: The [[G1 Climax]] in August (losing in the first round to [[Kensuke Sasaki]]), the [[G1 Tag League|Super Grade Tag League II]] in October (teaming with [[Tom Zenk]] and finishing with 0 points) and Battle Final in December.&lt;ref name=Neidplaces/&gt;

He debuted for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) on the May 15 episode of ''[[WCW Worldwide]]'', beating a [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber]]. After defeating another jobber on the next episode, Neidhart teamed with [[Junkyard Dog|The Junkyard Dog]] for the next, again beating jobbers. Neidhart and The Junkyard Dog beat [[Paul Orndorff]] and [[Dick Slater]] by disqualification on the June 5 ''[[WCW Saturday Night]]''. Eleven days later, he beat [[Mark Canterbury|Shanghai Pierce]] in a [[dark match]] before [[Clash of the Champions XXIII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw93.htm|title=WCW 1993 results, from TheHistoryOfWWE.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After losing to [[Maxx Payne]] at a house show in Kokomo, Indiana, on October 7, Neidhart left WCW.&lt;ref name=Neidplaces/&gt;

On November 13, 1993, Neidhart wrestled [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]] to a [[No contest (combat sports)|no contest]] at ECW's [[November to Remember#1993|November to Remember]] in the [[ECW Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|publisher=The History of WWE|title=ECW: 1992-93|accessdate=2018-08-15|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/ecw92-93.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to WWF (1994-1997)===
====Reunion with Owen Hart (1994-1995)====
[[File:Neidhart-Sincere.jpg|thumb|Neidhart in a wrestling match in 2009 against [[Tom Brandi|Salvatore Sincere]].]]
Neidhart returned to the WWF at [[King of the Ring (1994)|King of the Ring]] in 1994, as Bret Hart's cornerman for his [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match defense against [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]] [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]]. After Diesel hit Hart with his [[Powerbomb#Release powerbomb|Jackknife]] finisher, Neidhart interfered to prevent the pin, and disqualifying Hart but allowing him to retain the title. After the match, Diesel and [[Shawn Michaels]] beat down Hart, and Neidhart didn't intervene. Later that night, Neidhart reappeared at ringside again during Owen Hart's King of the Ring tournament final against [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Razor Ramon]]. He attacked Razor outside the ring, behind the referee's back, before Neidhart throwing Razor back for Hart to elbow drop and pin to become "The King of Harts", turning heel for the first time since 1988.&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt;

Owen had been feuding with Bret since the [[Royal Rumble (1994)|Royal Rumble]]. Neidhart, believing Bret had held Owen back from his potential, sided with Owen, and usually cornering him in matches through the summer. Neidhart claimed he'd only helped Bret keep the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at King of the Ring so Owen could take it from him. This opportunity came in a [[steel cage match]] at [[SummerSlam (1994)|SummerSlam]]. Neidhart sat in the third row during the match, behind other Hart family members. After Bret won the match, Neidhart entered the cage, locked it and helped Owen beat him down, while the Hart family members tried to climb over it and save him.

Neidhart joined Owen on Shawn Michaels' team, The Teamsters, to face Razor Ramon and The Bad Guys in an elimination match at [[Survivor Series (1994)|Survivor Series]].&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt; After they eliminated every Bad Guy except Razor, after Michaels inadvertently hit Diesel with the [[Superkick|Sweet Chin Music]]. This caused an argument and the tag team partners split up, before Diesel chased Michaels down the aisle. As the other Teamsters tried to intervene, and all were counted out.

Because Diesel and Michaels were WWF Tag Team Champions when they split, the title was vacated and a tournament held. Neidhart and Hart lost to The New Headshrinkers ([[Rikishi (wrestler)|Fatu]] and [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|Sionne]]) in the first round on the December 31 ''Superstars'', by disqualification. By the time it aired, Neidhart had left the WWF. Bret Hart wrote in his autobiography that the original plan was for Owen and Neidhart to win the tournament and the WWF Tag Team Championships but Neidhart was officially fired due to no-showing events. Owen wound up winning the WWF Tag Team Championships at [[WrestleMania XI]] with new partner [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]] and years later with fellow brother-in-law [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]].

====Who (1996)====
On the July 6, 1996 ''Superstars'', he returned as the masked heel Who, a gimmick designed for commentators [[Vince McMahon]] and [[Jerry Lawler]] to make "[[Who's on First?]]"-style jokes during his matches (most of which he lost). Who last appeared on TV in the "Bikini Beach Blast-Off" party on the [[SummerSlam (1996)|SummerSlam]] pre-show. His last match was a win over [[Alex Porteau]] in [[Miami]] on September 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/96.htm|title=1996 WWF results, from TheHistoryOfWWE.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Neidhartfalconcoperis.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Neidhart vs. Falcon Coperis UCW 1997]]
Neidhart wrestled for New York independent promotion Ultimate Championship Wrestling (UCW), against [[Chris Chavis|Tatanka]], his brother-in-law [[Bruce Hart (wrestler)|Bruce Hart]], [[King Kong Bundy]] and [[Marty Jannetty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Straight From the Hart|last=Hart|first=Bruce|page=55|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2011|isbn=978-1-55022-939-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WRESTLER CHARLES GUILLOTINE LeGRANDE ON TIGER KHAN"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://smashedmedia.us/tigerkhan/?p=19|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160128201333/http://smashedmedia.us/tigerkhan/?p=19|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2016-01-28|title= WRESTLER CHARLES "GUILLOTINE" LeGRANDE ON TIGER KHAN |publisher=smashedmedia.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Hart Foundation reunion and departure (1997)====
{{main|The Hart Foundation#The (New) Hart Foundation|l1=The Hart Foundation}}
Neidhart returned to the WWF on the April 28, 1997 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw is War]]'', and attacking [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and reuniting with Bret and Owen Hart as part of the new Hart Foundation, a [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]] of Canadian sympathizers, also including Davey Boy Smith and [[Brian Pillman]]. On July 6 at [[In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede]] in Bret's hometown [[Calgary]], The Hart Foundation defeated the American team of Stone Cold Steve Austin, [[Ken Shamrock]], [[Goldust]] and [[The Road Warriors|The Legion of Doom]].&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt; Neidhart was part of Team Canada at [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]] in [[Montreal]], teaming with The British Bulldog, [[Doug Furnas]] [[The Can-Am Express|and]] [[Phil Lafon|Philip Lafon]] defeated Team USA [[Big Van Vader|Vader]], Goldust, [[Marc Mero|"Marvelous" Marc Mero]] and the debut of [[Steve Blackman|"The Lethal Weapon" Steve Blackman]] (Bulldog was the sole survivor, Neidhart was pinned by Vader).&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt;

After Bret and Davey Boy Smith left the WWF on bad terms because of the [[Montreal Screwjob]] at [[Survivor Series (1997)|''Survivor Series'']]. [[D-Generation X]] leader and [[WWE Championship|WWF Champion]] [[Shawn Michaels]] offered Neidhart a spot in the group on the November 24 episode of ''Raw Is War''. Neidhart accepted, only for it to be revealed as a setup as the group assaulted Neidhart at the end of the show. The following week on the December 1 episode of ''Raw is War'', DX member [[Triple H]] defeated Neidhart. After the match, DX attacked Neidhart once again and spray-painted "WCW" on his back, and signifying him following Bret Hart to World Championship Wrestling. [[Sgt. Slaughter]] and Ken Shamrock saved him, before Slaughter and Shamrock attacked D-Generation X at the end of the show. After Raw is War, WWF announced that Neidhart was released from his WWF contract on December 2, 1997.

===Return to WCW (1998)===
In January 1998, Neidhart returned to World Championship Wrestling, where he formed a short-lived tag team with The British Bulldog, who also departed from the WWF following the infamous [[Montreal Screwjob]]. Although this was his first true big-money deal, they were rarely utilized by WCW. They achieved little in-ring success, and he was eventually released and returned to the [[independent circuit]]. His final match for WCW was on the September 26 episode of ''[[WCW Saturday Night]]'' where Neidhart and The British Bulldog lost to [[Stevie Ray]] and [[Virgil (wrestler)|Vincent]].

===Later WWE appearances (2007; 2013–2018)===
On ''Raw XV'', the 15th-anniversary ''[[WWE Raw]]'' special on December 10, 2007, Neidhart returned to WWE for the first time since 1997, and participated in the 15th Anniversary Battle Royal, eventually making it to the final five before being eliminated by [[Steve Keirn|Skinner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/12102007/|title=Rhodes and Holly golden on Raw's 15th Anniversary|date=2007-12-15|last=Clayton|first=Cory|accessdate=2008-09-14|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neidhart made appearances on the WWE and ''[[E!]]'' reality show ''[[Total Divas]]'', on which his daughter [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalie]] is a main cast member.

Neidhart appeared in [[Impact Wrestling|TNA]] on the November 12, 2009, edition of ''[[Impact! (TV series)|Impact!]]'' winning against [[Jay Lethal]] in his initial open challenge thrown out to the legends of professional wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_36725.shtml|title=Wilkenfeld's TNA Impact Report 11/12: Ongoing "virtual time" coverage of Spike TV broadcast|date=2009-11-12|last=Wilkenfeld|first=Daniel|accessdate=2009-11-13|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ancient Roman religion}}
'''Jupiter''' (from {{lang-la|Iūpiter}} {{IPA-la|ˈjuːpɪtɛr|}} or ''Iuppiter'' {{IPA-la|ˈjʊppɪtɛr|}}&lt;ref&gt;''Iūpiter
is thought to be the historically older form and ''Iuppiter'' to have arosen through the so-called ''littera''-rule. Compare [http://conf.ling.cornell.edu/weiss/Observations_on_the_littera_rule.pdf Weiss (2010)].&lt;/ref&gt;, from [[Proto-Italic language|Proto-Italic]] *djous "day, sky" + *patēr "father", thus "[[sky father]]"), also known as '''Jove''' [[genitive case|gen]]. ''Iovis'' {{IPA-la|ˈjɔwɪs|}}), is the [[sky god|god of the sky]] and [[god of thunder|thunder]] and [[Pantheon (gods)|king of the gods]] in [[Ancient Roman religion]] and [[Roman mythology|mythology]]. Jupiter was the chief deity of Roman state religion throughout the [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] eras, until [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christianity became the dominant religion of the Empire]]. In Roman mythology, he negotiates with [[Numa Pompilius]], the second [[king of Rome]], to establish principles of Roman religion such as offering, or sacrifice.

Jupiter is usually thought to have originated as an aerial god. His identifying implement is the [[thunderbolt]] and his primary sacred animal is the eagle,&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''Naturalis Historia'' X 16. A. Alföldi ''Zu den römischen Reiterscheiben''  in ''Germania''  '''30'''  1952 p. 188 and n. 11 as cited by G. Dumézil ''La religion reomaine archaïque'' Paris 1974 2nd ed., It. tr. Milan 1977 (hereafter cited as ARR) p. 215 n. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; which held precedence over other birds in the taking of [[auspices]]&lt;ref&gt;Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' II 374.&lt;/ref&gt; and became one of the most common symbols of the [[Roman army]] (see [[Aquila (Roman)|Aquila]]). The two emblems were often combined to represent the god in the form of an eagle holding in its claws a thunderbolt, frequently seen on Greek and Roman coins.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Roman Coins, see e.g. reverse of "Consecratio" coin of Emperor Commodus &amp; coin of Ptolemy V Epiphanes minted c. 204–180 BC.&lt;/ref&gt; As the sky-god, he was a divine witness to oaths, the sacred trust on which justice and good government depend. Many of his functions were focused on the [[Capitoline Hill]], where the [[Arx (Roman)|citadel]] was located. In the [[Capitoline Triad]], he was the central guardian of the state with [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]]. His sacred tree was the oak.
[[File:Jupiter statue, Vaticana.jpg|thumb|300px|Statue of ''Jupiter'', Vaticana, Rome.]]
The Romans regarded Jupiter as the [[interpretatio graeca|equivalent]] of the Greek [[Zeus]],&lt;ref name="Lar"&gt;''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Latin literature]] and [[Roman art]], the myths and iconography of Zeus are adapted under the name ''Iuppiter''. In the Greek-influenced tradition, Jupiter was the brother of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], the Roman equivalents of [[Poseidon]] and [[Hades]] respectively. Each presided over one of the three realms of the universe: sky, the waters, and the underworld. The [[Italic peoples|Italic]] '''Diespiter''' was also a sky god who manifested himself in the daylight, usually identified with Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;''Diespiter'' should not be confused with ''[[Dis pater]],'' but the two names do cause confusion even in some passages of ancient literature; P.T. Eden, [[commentary (philology)|commentary]] on the ''[[Apocolocyntosis]]'' (Cambridge University Press, 1984, 2002), pp. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tinia]] is usually regarded as his [[Etruscan religion|Etruscan]] counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Pallottino]], "Etruscan Daemonology," p. 41, and Robert Schilling, "Rome," pp. 44 and 63, both in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981); Giuliano Bonfante and [[Larissa Bonfante]] ''The Etruscan Language: An Introduction'' (Manchester University Press, 1983 rev. ed. 2003), pp. 24, 84, 85, 219, 225; Nancy Thomson de Grummond, ''Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend'' (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 2006), pp. 19, 53–58 ''et passim''; Jean MacIntosh Turfa, ''Divining the Etruscan World: The Brontoscopic Calendar and Religious Practice'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the state==
The Romans believed that Jupiter granted them supremacy because they had honoured him more than any other people had. Jupiter was "the fount of the [[auspices]] upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; He personified the divine authority of Rome's highest offices, internal organization, and external relations. His image in the [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] Capitol bore [[regalia]] associated with [[Kings of Rome|Rome's ancient kings]] and the highest [[Roman consul|consular]] and [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial honours]].&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arch of titus - imperial cortege.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Triumphator'' in his four-horse chariot, from the [[Arch of Titus]]|alt=Bas-relief of Roman driver in four-horse chariot, facing left.]]
The consuls swore their oath of office in Jupiter's name, and honoured him on the annual ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|feriae]]'' of the Capitol in September. To thank him for his help (and to secure his continued support), they offered him a white ox ''(bos mas)'' with gilded horns.&lt;ref&gt;Scheid, in Rüpke (ed), 263–271; G. Dumézil ARR It. tr. p. 181 citing [[Jean Bayet]] ''Les annales de Tite Live'' édition G. Budé vol. III 1942 Appendix V p. 153 and n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar offering was made by [[Roman Triumph|triumphal generals]], who surrendered the tokens of their victory at the feet of Jupiter's statue in the Capitol. Some scholars have viewed the ''triumphator'' as embodying (or impersonating) Jupiter in the triumphal procession.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil 1977 p. 259 note 4: cf. Servius ''Eclogae'' X 27  "''unde etiam triumphantes habent omnia insignia Iovis, sceptrum palmatamque togam''" "wherefore also the triumphing commanders have all the insignia of Jupiter, the sceptre and the toga palmata'". On the interpretation of the triumphal dress and of the triumph, Larissa Bonfante has offered an interpretation based on Etruscan documents in her article : "Roman Triumphs and Etruscan Kings: the Changing Face of the Triumph" in  ''Journal of Roman Studies'' '''60''' 1970 pp. 49–66 and tables I–VIII. [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]] rehearses various views of the ''triumphator'' as god or king in ''The Roman Triumph'' (Harvard University Press, 2007), pp. 226–232, and expresses skepticism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jupiter's association with kingship and sovereignty was reinterpreted as Rome's form of government changed. Originally, [[Kings of Rome|Rome was ruled by kings]]; after the monarchy was abolished and the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] established, religious prerogatives were transferred to the ''patres'', the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician ruling class]]. Nostalgia for the kingship ''(affectatio regni)'' was considered treasonous. Those suspected of harbouring monarchical ambitions were punished, regardless of their service to the state. In the 5th century BC, the ''triumphator'' [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]] was sent into exile after he drove a chariot with a team of four white horses ''([[quadriga]])''—an honour reserved for Jupiter himself. When [[Marcus Manlius Capitolinus|Marcus Manlius]], whose defense of the Capitol against the [[Sack of Rome (387 BC)|invading Gauls]] had earned him the name ''Capitolinus'', was accused of regal pretensions, he was executed as a traitor by being cast from the [[Tarpeian Rock]]. His house on the Capitoline Hill was razed, and it was decreed that no patrician should ever be allowed to live there.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil 1977 citing Livy V 23, 6 and VI 17, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Capitoline Jupiter found himself in a delicate position: he represented a continuity of royal power from the [[Roman Kingdom|Regal period]], and conferred power on the [[Roman Magistrates|magistrates]] who paid their respects to him; at the same time he embodied that which was now forbidden, abhorred, and scorned.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above 1977 p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Conflict of the Orders]], Rome's [[plebs|plebeians]] demanded the right to hold political and religious office. During their first ''[[Secessio plebis|secessio]]'' (similar to a [[general strike]]), they withdrew from the city and threatened to found their own. When they agreed to come back to Rome they vowed the hill where they had retreated to Jupiter as symbol and guarantor of the unity of the Roman ''res publica''.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil 1977 p.  citing Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' VI 90, 1; Festus s.v. p. 414 L 2nd.&lt;/ref&gt; Plebeians eventually became eligible for all the [[Roman Magistrates|magistracies]] and most priesthoods, but the high priest of Jupiter ''([[Flamen Dialis]])'' remained the preserve of patricians.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War'' (University of California Press, 2005, 2006), p. 159 ''et passim.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flamen and Flaminica Dialis===
[[File:Ara pacis fregio lato ovest 2 B.JPG|thumb|left|Detail of [[relief]] from the [[Ara Pacis|Augustan Altar of Peace]], showing ''flamines'' wearing the pointed ''[[Apex (headdress)|apex]]''|alt=Bas-relief of five Roman priests]]
{{Main|Flamen Dialis}}
Jupiter was served by the patrician Flamen Dialis, the highest-ranking member of the ''[[Flamen|flamines]],'' a [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|college]] of fifteen priests in the official public cult of Rome, each of whom was devoted to a particular deity. His wife, the Flaminica Dialis, had her own duties, and presided over the sacrifice of a ram to Jupiter on each of the ''[[Roman calendar#Nundinal cycle|nundinae]]'', the "market" days of a calendar cycle, comparable to a week.&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.16.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple were required to marry by the exclusive patrician ritual ''[[confarreatio]]'', which included a sacrifice of [[spelt]] bread to Jupiter Farreus (from ''far'', "wheat, grain").&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Dillon and Lynda Garland, "Religion in the Roman Republic," in ''Ancient Rome: From the Early Republic to the Assassination of Julius Caesar'' (Routledge, 2005), pp. 127, 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of Flamen Dialis was circumscribed by several unique ritual prohibitions, some of which shed light on the sovereign nature of the god himself.&lt;ref&gt;Most of the information about the Flamen Dialis is preserved by [[Aulus Gellius]], ''Attic Nights'' [https://archive.is/20120713140825/http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/10*.html X 15.]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the ''flamen'' may remove his clothes or ''[[Apex (headdress)|apex]]'' (his pointed hat) only when under a roof, in order to avoid showing himself naked to the sky—that is, "as if under the eyes of Jupiter" as god of the heavens. Every time the Flaminica saw a lightning bolt or heard a clap of thunder (Jupiter's distinctive instrument), she was prohibited from carrying on with her normal routine until she placated the god.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 16, 8: ''flaminica quotiens tonitrua audisset feriata erat, donec placasset deos.'' The adjective ''feriatus'', related to ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|feriae]]'', "holy days," pertains to keeping a holiday, and hence means "idle, unemployed," not performing one's usual tasks.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some privileges of the ''flamen'' of Jupiter may reflect the regal nature of Jupiter: he had the use of the [[curule chair]],&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 20, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the only priest ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sacerdos]])'' who was preceded by a [[lictor]]&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''Quaestiones Romanae'' 113.&lt;/ref&gt; and had a seat in the [[Roman senate|senate]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy XXVII 8, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Other regulations concern his ritual purity and his separation from the military function; he was forbidden to ride a horse or see the army outside the sacred boundary of Rome ''([[pomerium]]).'' Although he served the god who embodied the sanctity of the oath, it was not religiously permissible ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#fas|fas]])'' for the Dialis to swear an oath.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, 10.15.5: ''item iurare Dialem fas numquam est''; [[Robert E.A. Palmer]], "The Deconstruction of Mommsen on Festus 462/464L, or the Hazards of Interpretation," in ''Imperium sine fine: T. Robert S. Broughton and the Roman Republic'' (Franz Steiner, 1996), p. 85; Francis X. Ryan, ''Rank and Participation in the Republican Senate'' (Franz Steiner, 1998), p. 165. The [[Vestals]] and the Flamen Dialis were the only Roman citizens who could not be compelled to swear an oath (Aulus Gellius 10.15.31); Robin Lorsch Wildfang, ''Rome's Vestal Virgin: A Study of Rome's Vestal Priestesses in the Late Republic and Early Empire'' (Routledge, 2006), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; He could not have contacts with anything dead or connected with death: corpses, funerals, funeral fires, raw meat. This set of restrictions reflects the fulness of life and absolute freedom that are features of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil 1977 p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Augurs===
The ''augures publici'', [[augurs]] were a college of ''sacerdotes'' who were in charge of all inaugurations and of the performing of ceremonies known as ''auguria''. Their creation was traditionally ascribed to [[Romulus]]. They were considered the only official interpreters of Jupiter's will, thence they were essential to the very existence of the Roman State as Romans saw in Jupiter the only source of state authority.

===Fetials===
The [[fetials]] were a college of 20 men devoted to the religious administration of international affairs of state.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 94–96, 169, 192, 502–504; G. Wissowa ''Religion un Kultus der Römer'' Munich 1912 p. 104 Hereafter cited as RK). Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Rom. Ant.'' I 21, 1 ; Livy I 32, 4. See also ''[[ius gentium]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Their task was to preserve and apply the fetial law ''(ius fetiale)'', a complex set of procedures aimed at ensuring the protection of the gods in Rome's relations with foreign states. [[Iuppiter Lapis]] is the god under whose protection they act, and whom the chief fetial ''(pater patratus)'' invokes in the rite concluding a treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 24, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; If a [[declaration of war]] ensues, the fetial calls upon Jupiter and [[Quirinus]], the heavenly, earthly and [[chthonic]] gods as witnesses of any potential violation of the ''ius''. He can then declare war within 33 days.&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 32, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The action of the fetials falls under Jupiter's jurisdiction as the divine defender of good faith. Several emblems of the fetial office pertain to Jupiter. The ''silex'' was the stone used for the fetial sacrifice, housed in the Temple of [[Feretrius|Iuppiter Feretrius]], as was their sceptre. Sacred herbs ''(sagmina)'', sometimes identified as [[vervain]], had to be taken from the nearby [[Arx (Roman)|citadel ''(arx)'']] for their ritual use.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 502–504 and 169. {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=104}}, citing Paulus p. 92 M.; Servius  ''Aeneis'' XII 206; Livy I 24, 3–8; IX 5, 3; XXX 43, 9; Festus p. 321 M.; Pliny NH XXII 5; Marcianus apud ''Digesta'' I 8, 8 par. 1; Servius ''Aeneis''  VIII 641; XII 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jupiter and religion in the secessions of the plebs===
[[File:Jupiter cameo Louvre Bj1820.jpg|thumb|left|Jupiter's head crowned with laurel and ivy. Sardonyx cameo ([[Louvre]])]]
The role of Jupiter in the [[conflict of the orders]] is a reflection of the religiosity of the Romans. On one side, the patricians were able to naturally claim the support of the supreme god as they held the [[auspices]] of the State. On the other side, the [[pleb]]s (plebeians) argued that, as Jupiter was the source of justice, they had his favor because their cause was just.

The first secession was caused by the excessive debt burden on the plebs. The legal institute of the ''[[nexum]]'' permitted a debtor to become a slave of his creditor. The plebs argued the debts had become unsustainable because of the expenses of the wars wanted by the patricians. As the senate did not accede to the proposal of a total debt remission advanced by dictator and augur [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] the plebs retired on the Mount Sacer, a hill located three Roman miles to the North-northeast of Rome, past the Nomentan bridge on river [[Anio]].&lt;ref&gt;Varro in his ''Lingua Latina'' V writes of "Crustumerian secession" ("''a secessione Crustumerina''"）.&lt;/ref&gt; The place is windy and was usually the site of rites of divination performed by haruspices. The senate in the end sent a delegation composed of ten members with full powers of making a deal with the plebs, of which were part [[Menenius Agrippa]] and Manius Valerius. It was Valerius, according to the inscription found at Arezzo in 1688 and written on the order of Augustus as well as other literary sources, that brought the plebs down from the Mount, after the secessionists had consecrated it to ''Jupiter Territor'' and built an altar (''ara'') on its summit. The fear of the wrath of Jupiter was an important element in the solution of the crisis. The consecration of the Mount probably referred to its summit only. The ritual requested the participation of both an augur (presumably Manius Valerius himself) and a pontifex.&lt;ref&gt;F. Vallocchia "Manio Valerio Massimo dittatore ed augure" in ''Diritto @ Storia'' '''7''' 2008 (online).&lt;/ref&gt;

The second secession was caused by the autocratic and arrogant behaviour of the ''[[decemviri]]'', who had been charged by the Roman people with writing down the laws in use till then kept secret by the patrician magistrates and the ''sacerdotes''. All magistracies and the tribunes of the plebs had resigned in advance. The task resulted in the XII Tables, which though concerned only private law. The plebs once again retreated to the Sacer Mons: this act besides recalling the first secession was meant to seek the protection of the supreme god. The secession ended with the resignation of the ''decemviri'' and an amnesty for the rebellious soldiers who had deserted from their camp near Mount Algidus while warring against the Volscians, abandoning the commanders. The amnesty was granted by the senate and guaranteed by the ''pontifex maximus'' Quintus Furius (in Livy's version) (or Marcus Papirius) who also supervised the nomination of the new tribunes of the plebs, then gathered on the Aventine Hill. The role played by the ''pontifex maximus'' in a situation of vacation of powers is a significant element underlining the religious basis and character of the ''tribunicia potestas''.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. A. Rinolfi "Plebe, pontefice massimo, tribuni della plebe: a proposito di Livio 3.54.5–14" in ''Diritto @ Storia'' '''5''' 2006 (online).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths and legends==
[[File:Zeus pompei.JPG|thumb|right|Jupiter in a wall painting from [[Pompeii]], with eagle and globe|alt=Painting of a bearded, seated Jupiter, unclothed from the waist up and holding a staff]]
A dominant line of scholarship has held that Rome lacked a body of myths in its earliest period, or that this original mythology has been irrecoverably obscured by the influence of the [[Greek mythology|Greek narrative tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], "Characteristic Traits of Ancient Roman Religion," in ''Pietas: Selected Studies in Roman Religion'' (Brill, 1980), p. 241, ascribing the view that there was no early Roman mythology to [[Walter Friedrich Otto|W.F. Otto]] and his school.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Hellenization]] of Roman culture, Latin literature and iconography reinterpreted the myths of Zeus in depictions and narratives of Jupiter. In the legendary history of Rome, Jupiter is often connected to kings and kingship.

===Birth===
Jupiter is depicted as the twin of Juno in a statue at [[Praeneste]] that showed them nursed by [[Fortuna Primigenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Described by [[Cicero]], ''[[De divinatione]]'' 2.85, as cited by R. Joy Littlewood, "Fortune," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), vol. 1, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription that is also from Praeneste, however, says that Fortuna Primigenia was Jupiter's first-born child.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 1.60, as cited by Littlewood, "Fortune," p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jacqueline Champeaux sees this contradiction as the result of successive different cultural and religious phases, in which a wave of influence coming from the Hellenic world made Fortuna the daughter of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;J. Champeaux ''Fortuna. Le culte de la Fortune à Rome et dans le monde romain. I Fortuna dans la religion archaïque'' 1982 Rome: Publications de l'Ecole Française de Rome; as reviewed by John Scheid in ''Revue de l' histoire des religions'' 1986 '''203''' 1: pp. 67–68 (Comptes rendus).&lt;/ref&gt; The childhood of Zeus is an important theme in Greek religion, art and literature, but there are only rare (or dubious) depictions of Jupiter as a child.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), pp. 223–225.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numa===
Faced by a period of bad weather endangering the harvest during one early spring, King [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]] resorted to the scheme of asking the advice of the god by evoking his presence.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil 1977 pp. 51–52 and 197.&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded through the help of Picus and Faunus, whom he had imprisoned by making them drunk. The two gods (with a charm) evoked Jupiter, who was forced to come down to earth at the Aventine (hence named ''Iuppiter Elicius'', according to Ovid). After Numa skilfully avoided the requests of the god for human sacrifices, Jupiter agreed to his request to know how lightning bolts are averted, asking only for the substitutions Numa had mentioned: an onion bulb, hairs and a fish. Moreover, Jupiter promised that at the sunrise of the following day he would give to Numa and the Roman people pawns of the ''imperium''. The following day, after throwing three lightning bolts across a clear sky, Jupiter sent down from heaven a shield. Since this shield had no angles, Numa named it ''ancile''; because in it resided the fate of the ''imperium'', he had many copies made of it to disguise the real one. He asked the smith [[Mamurius Veturius]] to make the copies, and gave them to the [[Salii]]. As his only reward, Mamurius expressed the wish that his name be sung in the last of their ''carmina''.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti III'', 284–392. Festus s.v. Mamuri Veturi p. 117 L as cited by Dumézil 1977 p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch gives a slightly different version of the story, writing that the cause of the miraculous drop of the shield was a plague and not linking it with the Roman ''imperium''.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch Numa 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tullus Hostilius===
Throughout his reign, [[Tullus Hostilius|King Tullus]] had a scornful attitude towards religion. His temperament was warlike, and he disregarded religious rites and piety. After conquering the [[Albani people|Albans]] with the duel between the [[Horatii and Curiatii]], Tullus destroyed [[Alba Longa]] and deported its inhabitants to Rome. As [[Livy]] tells the story, omens ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#prodigium|prodigia]])'' in the form of a rain of stones occurred on the [[Alban Mount]] because the deported Albans had disregarded their ancestral rites linked to the sanctuary of Jupiter. In addition to the omens, a voice was heard requesting that the Albans perform the rites. A plague followed and at last the king himself fell ill. As a consequence, the warlike character of Tullus broke down; he resorted to religion and petty, superstitious practices. At last, he found a book by Numa recording a secret rite on how to evoke ''Iuppiter Elicius''. The king attempted to perform it, but since he executed the rite improperly the god threw a lightning bolt which burned down the king's house and killed Tullus.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil 1977 p. 175 citing Livy I 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tarquin the Elder===
When approaching Rome (where Tarquin was heading to try his luck in politics after unsuccessful attempts in his native [[Tarquinii]]), an eagle swooped down, removed his hat, flew screaming in circles, replaced the hat on his head and flew away.  Tarquin's wife [[Tanaquil]] interpreted this as a sign that he would become king based on the bird, the quadrant of the sky from which it came, the god who had sent it and the fact it touched his hat (an item of clothing placed on a man's most noble part, the head).&lt;ref&gt;R. Bloch ''Prodigi e divinazione nell' antica Roma'' Roma 1973. Citing Livy I 34, 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elder Tarquin is credited with introducing the Capitoline Triad to Rome, by building the so-called Capitolium Vetus. Macrobius writes this issued from his Samothracian mystery beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacrifices===
Sacrificial victims (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#hostia|hostiae]]'') offered to Jupiter were the ox (castrated bull), the lamb  (on the Ides, the  ''ovis idulis'') and the [[wikt:wether|wether]] (on the Ides of January).&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' I 587–588.&lt;/ref&gt;  The animals were required to be white. The question of the lamb's gender is unresolved; while a lamb is generally male, for the vintage-opening festival the flamen Dialis sacrificed a [[Sheep|ewe]].&lt;ref&gt;Varro LL VI 16. Sacrifices to Jupiter are also broached in Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 10. The issue of the sacrificial victims proper to a god is one of the most vexed topics of Roman religion: cf. Gérard Capdeville "Substitution de victimes dans les sacrifices d'animaux à Rome" in ''MEFRA'' ''' 83'''  2 1971 pp. 283–323. Also G. Dumézil "Quaestiunculae indo-italicae: 11. Iovi tauro verre ariete immolari non licet" in ''Revue d'études latins'' '''39''' 1961 pp. 242–257.&lt;/ref&gt; This rule seems to have had many exceptions, as the sacrifice of a ram on the [[Nundinae]] by the ''flaminica Dialis'' demonstrates.
During one of the crises of the [[Second Punic War|Punic Wars]], Jupiter was offered every animal born that year.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al, Vol 1, 32–36: the consecration made this a "Sacred Spring" ''(ver sacrum).'' The "contract" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals, but any that died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice would count as if already sacrificed. Sacred animals were already assigned to the gods, who ought to protect their own property.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temples===
====Temple of Capitoline Jupiter====
{{main|Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)}}
The temple to [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] stood on the [[Capitoline Hill]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 258–261.&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter was worshiped there as an individual deity, and with [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]] as part of the [[Capitoline Triad]]. The building was supposedly begun by king [[Tarquinius Priscus]], completed by the last king ([[Tarquinius Superbus]]) and inaugurated in the early days of the Roman Republic (September 13, 509 BC). It was topped with the statues of four horses drawing a [[quadriga]], with Jupiter as charioteer. A large statue of Jupiter stood within; on festival days, its face was painted red. &lt;!-- Need section on images, probably above or below this --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Fasti'', 1.201f.&lt;/ref&gt; In (or near) this temple was the ''Iuppiter Lapis'': the [[Jupiter Stone]], on which oaths could be sworn.

Jupiter's Capitoline Temple probably served as the architectural model for his provincial temples. 
When Hadrian built [[Aelia Capitolina]] on the site of [[Jerusalem]], a temple to Jupiter Capitolinus was erected in the place of the destroyed [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. &lt;!-- Permanent military shrine to Jupiter known as Capitolium (one case only) --&gt;

====Other temples in Rome====
There were two temples in Rome dedicated to ''Iuppiter Stator''; [[Temple of Jupiter Stator (8th century BC)|the first one]] was built and dedicated in 294 BC by [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] after the third Samnite War. It was located on the ''Via Nova'', below the ''Porta Mugonia'', ancient entrance to the Palatine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=107}}; Livy X 36, 1 and 37, 15 f.&lt;/ref&gt; Legend has attributed its founding to Romulus.&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 12; Dionysius of Halicarnassus II 59; Ovid ''Fasti'' VI 793; Cicero ''Catilinaria'' I 33.&lt;/ref&gt; There may have been an earlier shrine ''([[fanum]])'', since the Jupiter's cult is attested epigraphically.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=107}}: CIL VI 434, 435; IX 3023, 4534; X59-4; also III 1089.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovid]] places the temple's dedication on June 27, but it is unclear whether this was the original date,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=198}} and n. 1&lt;!-- Wissowa's note 1 or ours? --&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; or the rededication after the restoration by Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Based on the tradition of dedicating Jovian temples on the [[Roman calendar#Months|Ides]]. This assumption is supported by the [[calendar of Philocalus]], which states on the Ides of January (13): ''Iovi Statori c(ircenses) m(issus) XXIV''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Weihealtar für Jupiter.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Altar to Jupiter on the outskirts of legionary fortress, 2nd–3rd century AD. Inscription: "Dedicated by L. Lollius Clarus for himself and his family"|alt=Narrow stone altar, with inscription]]

[[Temple of Jupiter Stator (2nd century BC)|A second temple of ''Iuppiter Stator'']] was built and dedicated by Quintus Caecilus Metellus Macedonicus after his triumph in 146 BC near the [[Circus Flaminius]]. It was connected to [[Temple of Juno Regina (Campus Martius)|the restored temple of ''Iuno Regina'']] with a [[portico]] (''[[Porticus Octaviae|porticus Metelli]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=108}} and n. 1 citing Vitruvius ''De Architectura'' (hereafter Vitruvius) III 1, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Iuppiter Victor'' had a temple dedicated by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges (consul 292 BC)|Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges]] during the third Samnite War in 295 BC. Its location is unknown, but it may be on the Quirinal, on which an inscription reading ''D]iovei Victore''&lt;ref&gt;CIL VI 438.&lt;/ref&gt; has been found, or on the Palatine according to the ''Notitia'' in the ''Liber Regionum'' (regio X), which reads: ''aedes Iovis Victoris''. Either might have been dedicated on April 13 or June 13 (days of ''Iuppiter Victor'' and of ''Iuppiter Invictus'', respectively, in Ovid's ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' IV 621 and VI 650.&lt;/ref&gt;
Inscriptions from the imperial age have revealed the existence of an otherwise-unknown temple of  ''Iuppiter Propugnator'' on the Palatine.&lt;ref&gt;Protocols of a sacerdotal ''collegium'': {{harvp|Wissowa|1912}}, citing CIL VI 2004–2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iuppiter Latiaris and Feriae Latinae===
The cult of ''Iuppiter Latiaris'' was the most ancient known cult of the god: it was practised since very remote times near the top of the ''Mons Albanus'' on which the god was venerated as the high protector of the Latin League under the hegemony of [[Alba Longa]].

After the destruction of Alba by king Tullus Hostilius the cult was forsaken.  The god manifested his discontent through the prodigy of a rain of stones: the commission sent by the Roman senate to inquire was also greeted by a rain of stones and heard a loud voice from the grove on the summit of the mount requesting the Albans perform the religious service to the god according to the rites of their country. In consequence of this event the Romans instituted a festival of nine days (''nundinae'').   Nonetheless a plague ensued:  in the end Tullus Hostilius himself was affected and lastly killed by the god with a lightning bolt.&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 31 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was reestablished on its primitive site by the last Roman king Tarquin the Proud under the leadership of Rome.

The ''[[feriae Latinae]]'', or ''[[Latiar]]'' as they were known originally,&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius I 16. This identification has though been challenged by A. Pasqualini.&lt;/ref&gt; were the common festival  (''panegyris'') of the so-called Priscan Latins&lt;ref&gt;Festus s.v. prisci Latini p. : "the Latin towns that existed before the foundation of Rome".&lt;/ref&gt; and of the Albans.&lt;ref&gt;L. Schmitz in W. Smith  ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'' London 1875 s. v. Feriae p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt; Their restoration aimed at grounding Roman hegemony in this ancestral religious tradition of the Latins. The original cult was reinstated unchanged as is testified by some archaic features of the ritual:  the exclusion of wine from the sacrifice&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De Divinatione''  I 18; Dionysius Hal.  AR IV 49, 3; Festus p. 212 L l. 30 f.; '' Scholiasta Bobiensis ad Ciceronis pro Plancio'' 23.&lt;/ref&gt; the offers of milk and cheese and the ritual use of rocking among the games. Rocking is one of the most ancient rites mimicking ascent to Heaven and is very widespread. At the ''Latiar'' the rocking took place on a tree and the winner was of course the one who had swung the highest. This rite was said to have been instituted by the Albans to commemorate the disappearance of king [[Latinus]], in the battle against [[Mezentius]] king of [[Caere]]: the rite symbolised a search for him both on earth and in heaven. The rocking as well as the customary drinking of milk was also considered to commemorate and ritually reinstate infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Festus s.v. oscillantes p. 194 M; C. A. Lobeck ''Aglaophamus sive de theologiae mysticae Graecorum causis libri tres'' Königsberg 1829 p. 585.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans in the last form of the rite brought the sacrificial ox from Rome and every participant was bestowed a portion of the meat, rite known as ''carnem petere''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''Pro Plancio'' 23; Varro LL VI 25; Pliny NH III 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Other games were held in every participant borough. In Rome a race of chariots (''quadrigae'') was held starting from the Capitol: the winner drank a liquor made with absynth.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny XXVII 45.&lt;/ref&gt; This competition has been compared to the Vedic rite of the [[vajapeya]]: in it seventeen chariots run a phoney race which must be won by the king in order to allow him to drink a cup of ''madhu'', i. e. ''soma''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Alföldi ''Early Rome and the Latins'' Ann Arbor 1965 p. 33 n. 6 cited by O. de Cazanove above p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The feasting lasted for at least four days, possibly six according to [[Niebuhr]], one day for each of the six Latin and Alban ''decuriae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=109}}; L. Schmitz in ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'' London 1875 s. v. Feriae p. 529: Niebuhr  ''History of Rome'' II p. 35 citing Livy V 42, Plutarch  ''Camillus'' 42.&lt;/ref&gt; According to different records 47 or 53 boroughs took part in the festival  (the listed names too differ in Pliny NH III 69 and Dionysius of Halicarnassus AR V 61). The ''Latiar'' became an important feature of Roman political life as they were ''[[feriae conceptivae]]'', i. e. their date varied each year: the consuls and the highest magistrates were required to attend shortly after the beginning of the administration, originally on the Ides of March: the Feriae usually took place in early April. They could not start campaigning before its end and if any part of the games had been neglected or performed unritually the ''Latiar'' had to be wholly repeated. The inscriptions from the imperial age record the festival back to the time of the [[decemvir]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=110}}. CIL 2011–2022; XIV 2236–2248.&lt;/ref&gt;
Wissowa remarks the inner linkage of the temple of the Mons Albanus with that of the Capitol apparent in the common association with the rite of the [[Roman triumph|triumph]]:{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=110}} since 231 BC some triumphing commanders had triumphed there first with the same legal features as in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Livy XLII 21, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious calendar==
{{See also|Roman calendar}}

=== Ides ===
The [[Ides (calendar)|Ides]] (the midpoint of the month, with a full moon) was sacred to Jupiter, because on that day heavenly light shone day and night.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=101}}, citing Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 15, 14 and 18, Iohannes Lydus ''De Mensibus'' III 7, Plutarch ''Quaestiones Romanae'' 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Some (or all) Ides were ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|Feriae]] Iovis'', sacred to Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Rome's surviving calendars provide only fragmentary evidence for the ''Feriae'' but [[Georg Wissowa|Wissowa]] believes that every Ide was sacred to him.&lt;/ref&gt; On the Ides, a white lamb (''ovis idulis'') was led along Rome's [[Via Sacra|Sacred Way]] to the [[Arx (Roman)|Capitoline Citadel]] and sacrificed to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=101}}, citing Varro LL V 47; Festus p. 290 Müller, Paulus p. 104; Ovid ''Fasti'' I 56 and 588; Macrobius ''Sat.'' I 15, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter's two ''[[Epulum Jovis|epula Iovis]]'' festivals fell on the Ides, as did his temple foundation rites as ''Optimus Maximus'', ''Victor'', ''Invictus'' and (possibly) ''Stator''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=101}}: the ''epula Iovis'' fell on 13 September and 13 November. The temple foundation and festival dates are 13 September for Jupiter Optimus Maximus, 13 April for Jupiter Victor, 13 June for Jupiter Invictus, and perhaps 13 January for Jupiter Stator''.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nundinae ===
The ''[[nundinae]]'' recurred every ninth day, dividing the calendar into a market cycle analogous to a week. Market days gave rural people ''([[pagus|pagi]])'' the opportunity to sell in town and to be informed of religious and political edicts, which were posted publicly for three days. According to tradition, these festival days were instituted by the king [[Servius Tullius]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassius and Rutilius apud Macrobius I 16, 33. Tuditanus claimed they were instituted by Romulus and T. Tatius I 16, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The high priestess of Jupiter ''([[Flamen Dialis#Flaminica Dialis|Flaminica Dialis]])'' sanctified the days by sacrificing a ram to Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius I 16, 30: "...flaminica Iovi arietem solet immolare"; Dumézil ARR above p. 163 and n. 42, citing A. Kirsopp Michels ''The Calendar of the Roman Republic'' 1967 pp. 84–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivals===
{{See also|Roman festivals}}
During the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]], more [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|fixed holidays]] on the Roman calendar were devoted to Jupiter than to any other deity.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Viniculture and wine====
Festivals of [[viniculture]] and wine were devoted to Jupiter, since grapes were particularly susceptible to adverse weather.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa ''Religion und Kultus der Römer'' Munich 1912 pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil describes wine as a "kingly" drink with the power to inebriate and exhilarate, analogous to the Vedic [[Soma (deity)|Soma]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Roman festivals were connected with viniculture and wine.

The rustic ''[[Vinalia]] altera'' on August 19 asked for good weather for ripening the grapes before harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=101}}, citing Pliny ''NH'' XVIII 289: "This festival day was established for the placation (i. e. averting) of storms", "''Hunc diem festum tempestatibus leniendis institutum''".&lt;/ref&gt; When the grapes were ripe,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912}}, citing [[Pandects|Digest]] II 12, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; a sheep was sacrificed to Jupiter and the ''flamen Dialis'' cut the first of the grape harvest.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above Milan 1977 p. 173; {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Meditrinalia]] on October 11 marked the end of the grape harvest; the new wine was [[pressed (wine)|pressed]], tasted and mixed with old wine&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=101-102}}, citing Varro LL VI 21 ''Novum vetus vinum bibo, novo veteri morbo medeor''.&lt;/ref&gt; to control fermentation. In the ''Fasti Amiternini'', this festival is assigned to Jupiter. Later Roman sources invented a goddess ''Meditrina'', probably to explain the name of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil, ''Fêtes romaines d' été et d' automne'', Paris, 1975, pp. 97–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the ''[[Vinalia]] urbana'' on April 23, new wine was offered to Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;In Roman legend Aeneas vowed all of that year's wine of Latium to Jupiter before the battle with [[Mezentius]]: cf. G. Dumézil ARR above p. 173 ; Ovid ''Fasti'' IV 863 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Large quantities of it were poured into a ditch near the temple of [[Venus Erycina]], which was located on the Capitol.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=102}}, citing Varro LL VI 16, Pliny NH XVIII 287, Ovid  ''Fasti'' IV 863 ff., Paulus p. 65 and 374 M.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regifugium and Poplifugium====
{{See also|Regifugium|Poplifugia}}
The ''[[Regifugium]]'' ("King's Flight")&lt;ref&gt;Gary Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War'' (University of California Press, 2005, 2006), p. 136. ''Populus'' originally meant not "the people," but "army."&lt;/ref&gt; on February 24 has often been discussed in connection with the ''[[Poplifugia]]'' on July 5, a day holy to Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Turcan, ''The Cults of the Roman Empire'' (Blackwell, 1992, 1996, 2001 printing, originally published 1989 in French), p. 75. Wissowa had already connected the ''Poplifugia'' to Jupiter: RK p. 102, citing [[Cassius Dio]] XLVII 18 and the ''Fasti Amiternini''  (''feriae Iovis'').&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Regifugium'' followed the festival of ''Iuppiter [[Terminus (mythology)|Terminus]]'' (Jupiter of Boundaries) on February 23. Later Roman [[antiquarian]]s misinterpreted the ''Regifugium'' as marking the expulsion of the monarchy, but the "king" of this festival may have been the priest known as the ''[[rex sacrorum]]'' who ritually enacted the waning and renewal of power associated with the [[New Year]] (March 1 in the old Roman calendar).&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; A temporary vacancy of power (construed as a yearly "[[interregnum]]") occurred between the ''Regifugium'' on February 24 and the New Year on March 1 (when the lunar cycle was thought to coincide again with the solar cycle), and the uncertainty and change during the two winter months were over.&lt;ref&gt;André Magdelain "Auspicia ad patres redeunt" in ''Hommage á Jean Bayet'' Bruxelles 1964 527 ff. See also [[Jean Bayet]] ''Histoire politique et psychologique de la religion romaine'' Paris 1957 p. 99; [[Jacques Heurgon]], ''Rome et la Méditerranée occcidentale'' Paris 1969 pp. 204–208.; Paul-M. Martin "La fonction calendaire du roi de Rome et sa participation á certaines fêtes" in ''Annales de Bretagne et des pays de l' Ouest'' '''83''' 1976 2 pp. 239–244 part. p. 241; and Dario Sabbatucci ''La religione di Roma antica: dal calendario festivo all'ordine cosmico'' Milan 1988, as reviewed by Robert Turcan in ''Revue del'histoire des religions'' '''206''' 1989 1 pp. 69–73 part. p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars emphasize the traditional political significance of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), p. 33, note 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Poplifugia'' ("Routing of Armies"&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome'', p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;), a day sacred to Jupiter, may similarly mark the second half of the year; before the [[Julian calendar|Julian calendar reform]], the months were named numerically, ''[[Quintilis]]'' (the fifth month) to ''December'' (the tenth month).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Gagé]] thinks the murder of [[Servius Tullius]] occurred on this date, as [[Tarquin the Proud]] and his wife Tullia would have taken advtange of the occasion to claim publicly that Servius has lost the favour of the gods (especially Fortuna): Jean Gagé "La mort de Servius Tullius et le char de Tullia" in ''Revue belge de philologie et d' histoire'' '''41''' 1963 1 pp. 25–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Poplifugia'' was a "primitive military ritual" for which the adult male population assembled for purification rites, after which they ritually dispelled foreign invaders from Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epula Iovis====
{{See also|Epulum Jovis}} 
There were two festivals called ''epulum Iovis'' ("Feast of Jove"). One was held on September 13, the anniversary of the foundation of Jupiter's Capitoline temple. The other (and probably older) festival was part of the [[Plebeian Games]] ''(Ludi Plebei)'', and was held on November 13.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Le Bonniec ''Le culte de Cérès á Rome'' Paris 1958 p. 348, developing Jean Bayet ''Les annales de Tite Live'' (Titus Livius ''AUC libri qui supersunt'') ed. G. Budé vol. III Paris 1942 Appendix V pp. 145–153.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century BC, the ''epulum Iovis'' became similar to a [[lectisternium]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 485–486.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ludi====
{{See also|Ludi}}
The most ancient Roman games followed after one day (considered a ''dies ater'', or "black day", i. e. a day which was traditionally considered unfortunate even though it was not ''nefas'', see also article [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion]]) the two ''Epula Iovis'' of September and November.

The games of September were named ''Ludi Magni''; originally they were not held every year, but later became the annual ''Ludi Romani''&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen ''Römischen Forschungen'' II p. 42 ff. puts their founding on 366 BC at the establishment of the curule aedility. Cited by {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and were held in the [[Circus Maximus]] after a procession from the Capitol. The games were attributed to Tarquinius Priscus,&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 35, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and linked to the cult of Jupiter on the Capitol. Romans themselves acknowledged analogies with the [[Roman triumph|triumph]], which Dumézil thinks can be explained by their common Etruscan origin; the magistrate in charge of the games dressed as the ''triumphator'' and the ''[[pompa circensis]]'' resembled a triumphal procession. Wissowa and Mommsen argue that they were a detached part of the triumph on the above grounds&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=111–112}}, citing Livy V 41, 2 ; Tertullian ''De corona militis'' 13; Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Antiq. Rom.'' VII 72. Marquardt ''Staatsverwaltung'' III 508.&lt;/ref&gt; (a conclusion which Dumézil rejects).&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 488.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ludi Plebei'' took place in November in the [[Circus Flaminius]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 181 citing Jean Bayet ''Les annales de Tite Live'' édition G. Budé vol. III 1942 Appendix V p. 153 and n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Mommsen]] argued that the ''epulum'' of the Ludi Plebei was the model of the Ludi Romani, but Wissowa finds the evidence for this assumption insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=112}}, citing Mommsen CIL I 2nd p. 329, 335; ''Rǒmische Forschungen'' II 45, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ludi Plebei'' were probably established in 534 BC. Their association with the cult of Jupiter is attested by Cicero.&lt;ref&gt;''In Verrem'' V 36 and Paulus s.v. ''ludi magni'' p.&amp;nbsp;122 M.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Larentalia====
The ''feriae'' of December 23 were devoted to a major ceremony in honour of [[Acca Larentia]] (or ''Larentina''), in which some of the highest religious authorities participated (probably including the [[Flamen Quirinalis]] and the [[pontiff]]s). The [[Fasti Praenestini]] marks the day as ''feriae Iovis'', as does Macrobius.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius I 10, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether the rite of ''parentatio'' was itself the reason for the festival of Jupiter, or if this was another festival which happened to fall on the same day. Wissowa denies their association, since Jupiter and his ''flamen'' would not be involved with the [[Roman mythology|underworld]] or the deities of death (or be present at a funeral rite held at a gravesite).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=102}}, citing Gellius X 15, 12. 24; Paulus p. 87 M.; Pliny NH XVIII 119; Plutarch ''Quaest. Romanae'' 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and epithets==
The Latin name ''Iuppiter'' originated as a [[Vocative case|vocative compound]] of the [[Old Latin]] vocative *''Iou'' and ''pater'' ("father") and came to replace the Old Latin [[nominative case]] *''Ious''. Jove&lt;ref&gt;Most common in [[poetry]], for its useful [[Poetry#Meter|meter]], and in the expression "By Jove!"&lt;/ref&gt; is a less common [[English (language)|English]] formation based on ''Iov-'', the stem of oblique cases of the Latin name. [[Linguistics|Linguistic]] studies identify the form *''Iou-pater'' as deriving from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] vocative compound *''Dyēu-pəter'' (meaning "O Father Sky-god"; nominative: *''[[Dyeus|Dyēus]]-pətēr'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/8.html |title=Indo-European and the Indo-Europeans |accessdate=2008-09-27 |work=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=4th |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major epithets===
{{Main|Epithets of Jupiter}}
The epithets of a Roman god indicate his theological qualities. The study of these epithets must consider their origins (the historical context of an epithet's source).

Jupiter's most ancient attested forms of cult belong to the State cult: these include the mount cult (see section above note n. 22&lt;!-- a less easily broken reference here could use an anchor --&gt;).  In Rome this cult entailed the existence of particular sanctuaries the most important of which were located on ''Mons Capitolinus'' (earlier ''Tarpeius''). The mount had two tops that were both destined to the discharge of acts of cult related to Jupiter. The northern and higher top was the ''[[Arx (Roman)|arx]]'' and on it was located the observation place of the [[augurs]] ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#auguraculum|auguraculum]])'' and to it headed the monthly procession of the ''sacra Idulia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=108}}, citing Varro LL V 47 and Festus p. 290 M. s.v. Idulia.&lt;/ref&gt; On the southern top was to be found the most ancient sanctuary of the god: the shrine of  ''Iuppiter Feretrius'' allegedly built by Romulus, restored by Augustus. The god here had no image and was represented by the sacred flintstone (''silex'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=108}}, citing Paulus p. 92 M.; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' VIII 641.&lt;/ref&gt; The most ancient known rites, those of the ''spolia opima'' and of the [[fetials]] which connect Jupiter with Mars and Quirinus are dedicated to ''Iuppiter Feretrius'' or ''Iuppiter Lapis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=108}}, citing Festus p. 189 M. s.v. lapis; Polybius ''Historiae'' III 25, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the sky god was already overlapped with the ethical and political domain since this early time. According to Wissowa and Dumézil&lt;ref name="G. Dumézil ARR above p. 169"&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iuppiter Lapis'' seems to be inseparable from ''Iuppiter Feretrius'' in whose tiny templet on the Capitol the stone was lodged.
 
Another most ancient epithet is ''Lucetius'': although the Ancients, followed by some modern scholars such as Wissowa,{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=100}} interpreted it as referring to sunlight, the ''carmen Saliare'' shows that it refers to lightning.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ARR above p. 167. The ''carmen Saliare'' has: "cume tonas Leucesie prai ted tremonti/ quot tibi etinei deis cum tonarem".&lt;/ref&gt; A further confirmation of this interpretation is provided by the sacred meaning of lightning which is reflected in the sensitivity of the ''flaminica Dialis'' to the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt; To the same atmospheric complex belongs the epithet ''Elicius'': while the ancient erudites thought it was connected to lightning, it is in fact related to the opening of the rervoirs of rain, as is testified by the ceremony of the ''Nudipedalia'', meant to propitiate rainfall and devoted to Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 168 citing [[Petronius]] ''[[Satyricon]]'' 44.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ritual of the ''[[lapis manalis]]'', the stone which was brought into the city through the ''Porta Capena'' and carried around in times of drought, which was named ''Aquaelicium''.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus s. v. p. 94 L 2nd; p. 2 M; Tertullian ''Apologeticum'' 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Other early epithets connected with the atmospheric quality of Jupiter are ''Pluvius'', ''Imbricius'', ''Tempestas'', ''Tonitrualis'', ''tempestatium divinarum potens'', ''Serenator'', ''Serenus''&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius ''De Mundo'' 37; cf. ''Iuppiter Serenus'' CIL VI 431, 433,; XI 6312;  ''Iuppiter Pluvialis'' CIL XI 324.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Iuppiter Serenus'' has been recognized as an ''interpretatio'' of the Phocean god Ζευς Ούριος: F. Cenerini above p. 104 citing Giancarlo Susini "Iuppiter Serenus e altri dei" in ''Epigraphica'' '''33''' 1971 pp. 175–177.&lt;/ref&gt; and, referred to lightning, ''Fulgur'',&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius I 2, 5; CIL I 2nd p. 331: sanctuary in the Campus Martius, dedicated on October 7 according to calendaries.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fulgur Fulmen'',&lt;ref&gt;CIL XII 1807.&lt;/ref&gt; later as nomen agentis  ''Fulgurator'', ''Fulminator'':&lt;ref&gt;CIL VI 377; III 821, 1596, 1677, 3593, 3594, 6342 cited by {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the high antiquity of the cult is testified by the neutre form ''Fulgur'' and the use of the term for the ''bidental'', the lightning well dug on the spot hit by a lightning bolt.&lt;ref&gt;Festus s. v. provorsum fulgur p. 229 M: "...; itaque Iovi Fulguri et Summano fit, quod diurna Iovis nocturna Summani fulgura habentur." as cited by {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jupiter bronze Luxembourg MNHA.jpg|thumb|A bronze statue of Jupiter, from the territory of the [[Treveri]]]]
A group of epithets has been interpreted by Wissowa (and his followers) as a reflection of the agricultural or warring nature of the god, some of which are also in the list of eleven preserved by Augustine.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine ''De Civitate Dei'' (herafter CD) VII 11. ''Pecunia'' is tentatively included in this group by {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=105}} n.  4. Cfr. Augustine CD VII 11 end and 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Frugifer'' CIL XII 336. Apuleius ''De Mundo'' 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The agricultural ones include ''Opitulus'', ''Almus'', ''Ruminus'', ''Frugifer'', ''Farreus'', ''Pecunia'', ''Dapalis'',&lt;ref&gt;Cato ''De Agri Cultura'' 132; Paulus s. v. p. 51 M.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Epulo''.&lt;ref&gt;CIL VI 3696.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine gives an explanation of the ones he lists which should reflect Varro's: ''Opitulus'' because he brings ''opem'' (means, relief) to the needy, ''Almus'' because he nourishes everything, ''Ruminus'' because he nourishes the living beings by breastfeeding them, ''Pecunia'' because everything belongs to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=105}} n. 4 understands ''Pecunia'' as protector and increaser of the flock.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dumézil maintains the cult usage of these epithets is not documented and that the epithet Ruminus, as Wissowa and Latte remarked, may not have the meaning given by Augustine but it should be understood as part of a series including  ''Rumina'', '' Ruminalis ficus'', ''Iuppiter Ruminus'', which bears the name of Rome itself with an Etruscan vocalism preserved in inscriptions, series that would be preserved in the sacred language (cf. ''Rumach'' Etruscan for Roman). However many scholars have argued that the name of Rome, ''Ruma'', meant in fact woman's breast.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Migliorini s.v. Roma in ''Enciclopedia Italiana di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti'' vol. XXIX p. 589; A. W. Schlegel ''Sämtliche Werke'' Leipzig 1847 XII p. 488; F. Kort ''Römische Geschichte'' Heidelberg 1843 p.32-3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diva Rumina]], as Augustine testifies in the cited passage, was the goddess of suckling babies: she was venerated near the ''ficus ruminalis'' and was offered only libations of milk.&lt;ref&gt;N. G. L. Hammond &amp; H. H. Scullard (Eds.) ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'' Oxford 1970 s. v. p. 940.&lt;/ref&gt; Here moreover Augustine cites the verses devoted to Jupiter by [[Quintus Valerius Soranus]], while hypothesising ''Iuno'' (more adept in his view as a breastfeeder), i.e. Rumina instead of Ruminus, might be nothing else than  ''Iuppiter'': "''Iuppiter omnipotens regum rerumque deumque Progenitor genetrixque deum...''".

In Dumézil's opinion ''Farreus'' should be understood as related to the rite of the ''confarreatio'' the most sacred form of marriage, the name of which is due to the spelt cake eaten by the spouses, rather than surmising an agricultural quality of the god: the epithet means the god was the guarantor of the effects of the ceremony, to which the presence of his flamen is necessary and that he can interrupt with a clap of thunder.&lt;ref&gt;Servius IV 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

The epithet ''Dapalis'' is on the other hand connected to a rite described by Cato and mentioned by Festus.&lt;ref&gt;Cato ''De Agri Cultura'' 132; Festus s. v. daps, dapalis, dapaticum pp. 177–178 L 2nd.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the sowing of autumn or spring the peasant offered a banquet of roast beef and a cup of wine to Jupiter : it is natural that on such occasions he would entreat the god who has power over the weather, however Cato' s prayer of s one of sheer offer and no request. The language suggests another attitude: Jupiter is invited to a banquet which is supposedly abundant and magnificent. The god is honoured as ''summus''. The peasant may hope he shall receive a benefit, but he does not say it. This interpretation finds support in the analogous urban ceremony of the ''epulum Iovis'', from which the god derives the epithet of  ''Epulo''  and which was a magnificent feast accompanied by flutes.&lt;ref&gt;''Epulo'' CIL VI 3696.&lt;/ref&gt;

Epithets related to warring are in Wissowa's view  ''Iuppiter Feretrius'', ''Iuppiter Stator'', ''Iuppiter Victor'' and ''Iuppiter Invictus''.{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|pages=105-108}} ''Feretrius'' would be connected with war by the rite of the first type of  ''[[spolia opima]]'' which is in fact a dedication to the god of the arms of the defeated king of the enemy that happens whenever he has been killed by the king of Rome or his equivalent authority. Here too Dumézil notes the dedication has to do with regality and not with war, since the rite is in fact the offer of the arms of a king by a king:  a proof of such an assumption is provided by the fact that the arms of an enemy king captured by an officer or a common soldier were dedicated to Mars and Quirinus respectively.

''Iuppiter Stator'' was first attributed by tradition to [[Romulus]], who had prayed the god for his almighty help at a difficult time the battle with the Sabines of king Titus Tatius.&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 12, 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil opines the action of Jupiter is not that of a god of war who wins through fighting: Jupiter acts by causing an inexplicable change in the morale of the fighters of the two sides. The same feature can be detected also in the certainly historical record of the battle of the third Samnite War in 294 BC, in which consul [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] vowed a temple to ''Iuppiter Stator'' if "Jupiter will stop the rout of the Roman army and if afterwards the Samnite legions shall be victouriously massacred...It looked as if the gods themselves had taken side with Romans, so much easily did the Roman arms succeed in prevailing...".&lt;ref&gt;Livy X 36, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil above pp. 174–75.&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar manner one can explain the epithet ''Victor'', whose cult was founded in 295 BC on the battlefield of [[Sentinum]] by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges (consul 292 BC)|Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges]] and who received another vow again in 293 by consul [[Lucius Papirius Cursor]] before a battle against the Samnite ''legio linteata''. The religious meaning of the vow is in both cases an appeal to the supreme god by a Roman chief at a time of need for divine help from the supreme god, albeit for different reasons: Fabius had remained the only political and military responsible of the Roman State after the ''devotio'' of P. Decius Mus, Papirius had to face an enemy who had acted with impious rites and vows, i.e. was religiously reprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;Livy X 29, 12–17; ''nefando sacro, mixta hominum pecudumque caedes'', "by an impious rite, a mixed slaughter of people and flock" 39, 16; 42, 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently Dario Sabbatucci has given a different interpretation of the meaning of ''Stator'' within the frame of his structuralistic and dialectic vision of Roman calendar, identifying oppositions, tensions and equilibria: January is the month of [[Janus]], at the beginning of the year, in the uncertain time of winter (the most ancient calendar had only ten months, from March to December). In this month Janus deifies kingship and defies Jupiter. Moreover, January sees also the presence of [[Veiovis]] who appears as an anti-Jupiter, of [[Carmenta]] who is the goddess of birth and like Janus has two opposed faces, ''Prorsa'' and ''Postvorta'' (also named [[Antevorta]] and [[Antevorta|Porrima]]), of [[Iuturna]], who as a gushing spring evokes the process of coming into being from non-being as the god of passage and change does. In this period the preeminence of Janus needs compensating on the Ides through the action of Jupiter ''Stator'', who plays the role of anti-Janus, i.e. of moderator of the action of Janus.&lt;ref&gt;Dario Sabbatucci above, as summarized in the review by Robert Turcan above p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epithets denoting functionality====
Some epithets describe a particular aspect of the god, or one of his functions:
*'''Jove Aegiochus''', Jove "Holder of the Goat or Aegis", as the father of [[Aegipan]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica.html Astronomica]'', [[Hyginus]], translated by Mary Grant, pt.1, ch.2, sec.13&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Jupiter Caelus''', Jupiter as the sky or heavens; see also [[Caelus]].
*'''Jupiter Caelestis''', "Heavenly" or "Celestial Jupiter".
*'''Jupiter Elicius''', Jupiter "who calls forth [celestial omens]" or "who is called forth [by incantations]"; "sender of rain".
*'''Jupiter Feretrius''', who carries away the [[War looting|spoils of war]]". Feretrius was called upon to witness solemn oaths.&lt;ref&gt;''Der Große Brockhaus'', vol.9, Leipzig: Brockhaus 1931, p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet or "[[numen]]" is probably connected with the verb ''ferire'', "to strike," referring to a ritual striking of ritual as illustrated in ''foedus ferire'', of which the ''silex'', a quartz rock, is evidence in his temple on the Capitoline hill, which is said to have been the first temple in Rome, erected and dedicated by [[Romulus]] to commemorate his winning of the ''spolia opima'' from Acron, king of the Caeninenses, and to serve as a repository for them. ''Iuppiter Feretrius'' was therefore equivalent to ''Iuppiter Lapis'', the latter used for a specially solemn oath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Jupiter_Feretrius.html Samuel Ball Platner, revised by Thomas Ashby: ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'', London: Oxford University Press, 1929 p.293]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Livy I 10, 5 and Plutarch ''Marcellus'' 8 though, the meaning of this epithet is related to the peculiar frame used to carry the ''spolia opima'' to the god, the ''feretrum'', itself from verb ''fero'',
*'''Jupiter Centumpeda''', literally, "he who has one hundred feet"; that is, "he who has the power of establishing, of rendering stable, bestowing stability on everything", since he himself is the paramount of stability.
*'''Jupiter Fulgur''' ("Lightning Jupiter"), '''Fulgurator''' or '''Fulgens'''
*'''Jupiter Lucetius''' ("of the light"), an epithet almost certainly related to the light or flame of lightningbolts and not to daylight, as indicated by the Jovian verses of the [[carmen Saliare]].&lt;ref&gt;''cume tonas, Leucesie, prai ted tremonti...''; G. Dumézil above p. It. tr. Milan 1977 p.168.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Jupiter Optimus Maximus]]''' (" the best and greatest"). ''Optumus''&lt;ref&gt;''Optimus'' is a superlative formed on ''ops'' [ability to help], the ancient form is ''optumus'' from ''opitumus'', cf. the epithet ''Opitulus'' [The Helper].&lt;/ref&gt; because of the benefits he bestows, ''Maximus'' because of his strength, according to Cicero ''Pro Domo Sua''.&lt;ref&gt;As cited by Dumézil ARR It tr. p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Pluvius|Jupiter Pluvius]]''', "sender of rain".
*'''Jupiter Ruminus''', "breastfeeder of every living being", according to Augustine.&lt;ref&gt;St. Augustine, The City of God, Books 1-10, Pg 218&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Jupiter Stator''', from ''stare'', "to stand": "he who has power of founding, instituting everything", thence also he who makes people, soldiers, stand firm and fast&lt;ref&gt;St. Augustine, The City of God, Books 1-10&lt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Jupiter Summanus]]''', sender of nocturnal thunder
*'''[[Terminus (mythology)|Jupiter Terminalus]]''' or '''Iuppiter Terminus''', patron and defender of boundaries
*'''Jupiter Tigillus''', "beam or shaft that supports and holds together the universe."&lt;ref name="Augustine CD VII 11"&gt;Augustine CD VII 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Jupiter Tonans]]''', "thunderer"
*'''Jupiter Victor''', "he who has the power of conquering everything."&lt;ref name="Augustine CD VII 11" /&gt;

====Syncretic or geographical epithets====
Some epithets of Jupiter indicate his association with a particular place. Epithets found in the provinces of the Roman Empire may identify Jupiter with a local deity or site (see [[syncretism]]).
*'''Jupiter Ammon''', Jupiter equated with the Egyptian deity [[Amun]] after the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman conquest of Egypt]]
*'''Jupiter Brixianus''', Jupiter equated with the local god of the town of [[Brescia]] in [[Cisalpine Gaul]] (modern North [[Italy]])
*'''Jupiter Capitolinus''', also Jupiter Optimus Maximus, venerated throughout the [[Roman Empire]] at sites with a ''Capitol'' ([[Capitolium]])
*'''[[Jupiter Dolichenus]]''', from [[Gaziantep|Doliche]] in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], originally a [[Baal]] weather and war god. From the time of [[Vespasian]], he was popular among the [[Roman legions]] as god of war and victory, especially on the [[Danube]] at [[Carnuntum]]. He is depicted as standing on a bull, with a thunderbolt in his left hand, and a double ax in the right.
*'''[[Jupiter Indiges]]''', "Jupiter of the country," a title given to [[Aeneas]] after his death, according to [[Livy]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], [[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]] Book 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Jupiter Ladicus''', Jupiter equated with a Celtiberian mountain-god and worshipped as the spirit of Mount Ladicus in [[Gallaecia]], northwest Iberia,&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' II, 2525; Toutain. 1920. 143ff.&lt;/ref&gt; preserved in the toponym ''Codos de Ladoco''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Dictionary'', ''s.v.'' "Ladicus")&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Jupiter Laterius''' or '''Latiaris''', the god of [[Latium]]
*'''Jupiter Parthinus''' or '''Partinus''', under this name was worshiped on the borders of northeast [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and [[Upper Moesia]], perhaps associated with the local tribe known as the [[Partheni]].
*'''Jupiter Poeninus''', under this name worshipped in the Alps, around the [[Great St Bernard Pass]], where he had a sanctuary.
*'''Jupiter Solutorius''', a local version of Jupiter worshipped in [[Spain]]; he was syncretised with the local [[Iberians|Iberian]] god [[Eacus (god)|Eacus]].
*'''Jupiter Taranis''', Jupiter equated with the Celtic god [[Taranis]].
*'''Jupiter Uxellinus''', Jupiter as a god of high mountains.&lt;!--isn't this a Gaulish epithet, as in Uxellodunum--&gt;

In addition, many of the epithets of Zeus can be found applied to Jupiter, by ''[[interpretatio romana]]''. Thus, since the hero [[Trophonius]] (from [[Lebadea]] in Boeotia) is called Zeus Trophonius, this can be represented in English (as it would be in Latin) as Jupiter Trophonius. Similarly, the Greek cult of Zeus [[Meilichios]] appears in Pompeii as Jupiter Meilichius. Except in representing actual cults in Italy, this is largely 19th-century usage; modern works distinguish Jupiter from Zeus.

==Theology==

===Sources===
[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] and [[Verrius Flaccus]]&lt;ref&gt;The work of Verrius Flaccus is preserved through the summary of [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] and his epitomist [[Paul the Deacon]].&lt;/ref&gt; were the main sources on the theology of Jupiter and archaic Roman religion in general. Varro was acquainted with the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#libri pontificales|libri pontificum]]'' ("books of the [[College of Pontiffs|Pontiffs]]") and their archaic classifications.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Dumézil ''La religion romaine archaïque'', Payot, Paris, 1974 2nd "Remarques preliminaires" X; It. tr. Milan 1977 p. 59ff.; citing Lucien Gerschel "Varron logicien" in ''Latomus'' '''17''' 1958 pp. 65–72.&lt;/ref&gt; On these two sources depend other ancient authorities, such as [[Ovid]], [[Servius]], [[Aulus Gellius]], [[Macrobius]], [[Church Fathers|patristic texts]], [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] and [[Plutarch]].

One of the most important sources which preserve the theology of Jupiter and other [[List of Roman deities|Roman deities]] is ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God against the Pagans]]'' by [[Augustine of Hippo]]. Augustine's criticism of traditional Roman religion is based on Varro's lost work, ''[[Res divina|Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum]]''. Although a work of [[Christian apologetics]], ''The City of God'' provides glimpses into Varro's theological system and authentic Roman theological lore in general. According to Augustine,&lt;ref&gt;Augustine ''De Civitate Dei'' IV 27; VI 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Varro drew on the pontiff [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex|Mucius Scaevola]]'s tripartite theology:

* The [[mythical theology|mythic theology]] of the poets (useful for the [[Theatre of ancient Rome|theatre]])
* The [[Natural theology|physical theology]] of the philosophers (useful for understanding the natural world)
* The civil theology of the priests (useful for the state)&lt;ref&gt;J. Pépin "La théologie tripartite de Varron" ''Revue des études augustiniennes'' '''2''' 1956 pp. 265-294. Dumézil has pointed out that even though Augustine may be correct in pointing out cases in which Varro presented under the civil theology category contents that may look to belong to mythic theology, nevertheless he preserved under this heading the lore and legends ancient Romans considered their own.&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Theology of Jupiter in early Rome}}Jovian theology===
[[Georg Wissowa]] stressed Jupiter's uniqueness as the only case among Indo-European religions in which the original god preserved his name, his identity and his prerogatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, Jupiter is the god of heaven and retains his identification with the sky among the Latin poets (his name is used as a synonym for "sky".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912}} cites three passages from Horace, ''Carmina'': I 1, 25 ''manet sub Iove frigido venator''; I 22, 20 ''quod latus mundi nebulae malusque Iuppiter urget''; III 10, 7 ''ut glaciet nives puro numine Iuppiter''.&lt;/ref&gt;) In this respect, he differs from his Greek equivalent Zeus (who is considered a personal god, warden and dispenser of skylight). His name reflects this idea; it is a derivative of the Indo-European word for "bright, shining sky". His residence is found atop the hills of Rome and of mountains in general; as a result, his cult is present in Rome and throughout Italy at upper elevations.&lt;ref&gt;On the Esquiline lies the ''sacellum'' of  ''Iuppiter Fagutalis'' (Varro ''De Lingua Latina'' V 152 (hereafter LL), Paulus p. 87 M., Pliny ''Naturalis historia'' XVI 37 (hereafter NH), CIL VI 452); on the Viminal is known a ''Iuppiter Viminius'' (Varro LL V 51, Festus p. 376); a ''Iuppiter Caelius'' on the Caelius (CIL VI 334); on the Quirinal the so called ''Capitolium Vetus'' (Martial V 22, 4; VII 73, 4). Outside Rome: Iuppiter Latiaris on ''Mons Albanus'', Iuppiter Appenninus (Orelli 1220, CIL VIII 7961 and XI 5803) on the Umbrian Appennines, at Scheggia, on the [[Via Flaminia]], Iuppiter Poeninus (CIL 6865 ff., cfr. Bernabei ''Rendiconti della Regia Accademia dei Lincei'' '''III''', 1887, fascicolo 2, p. 363 ff.) at the Great Saint Bernard Pass, Iuppiter Vesuvius (CIL X 3806), Iuppiter Ciminus (CIL XI 2688); the Sabine Iuppiter Cacunus (CIL IX 4876, VI 371). Outside Italy Iuppiter Culminalis in Noricum and Pannonia (CIL III 3328, 4032, 4115, 5186; Supplememtum 10303, 11673 etc.) as cited by {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=102}} and Francesca Cenerini "Scritture di santuari extraurbani tra le Alpi e gli Appennini" in ''[[Mélanges de l'École française de Rome]]'' (hereafter ''MEFRA'')  '''104''' 1992 1 pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter assumed atmospheric qualities; he is the wielder of lightning and the master of weather. However, Wissowa acknowledges that Jupiter is not merely a naturalistic, heavenly, supreme deity; he is in continual communication with man by means of thunder, lightning and the flight of birds (his [[auspices]]). Through his vigilant watch he is also the guardian of public oaths and compacts and the guarantor of good faith in the State cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=100-101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jovian cult was common to the [[Italic people]] under the names ''Iove'', ''Diove'' (Latin) and  ''Iuve'', ''Diuve'' (Oscan, in Umbrian only ''Iuve'', ''Iupater'' in the [[Iguvine Tables]]).

Wissowa considered Jupiter also a god of war and agriculture, in addition to his political role as guarantor of good faith (public and private) as ''Iuppiter Lapis'' and ''Dius Fidius'', respectively. His view is grounded in the sphere of action of the god (who intervenes in battle and influences the harvest through weather).{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=103–108}}
 
In [[Georges Dumézil]]'s view, Jovian theology (and that of the equivalent gods in other Indo-European religions) is an evolution from a naturalistic, supreme, celestial god identified with heaven to a sovereign god, a wielder of lightning bolts, master and protector of the community (in other words, of a change from a naturalistic approach to the world of the divine to a socio-political approach).&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil above It. tr. pp. 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Giorgione, The tempest.jpg|thumb|One interpretation of the lightning in [[Giorgione]]'s ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|Tempest]]'' is that it represents the presence of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Salvatore Settis, ''Giorgione's ''Tempest'': Interpreting the Hidden Subject'', University of Chicago Press, 1990, p. 62, summarising this scholarly interpretation: "The lightning is Jove." cf Peter Humfrey, ''Painting in Renaissance Venice'', Yale University Press, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ARLTK284AHAC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=Giorgione+tempest+jupiter&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cSp_TpupGYTo0QGe2tz-Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Giorgione%20tempest%20jupiter&amp;f=false p.118f.]&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=Painting of a mother feeding her child, watched by a shepherd, with lightning flashing across a dark sky in the background]]

In [[Vedic mythology|Vedic religion]], [[Dyaus Pitar]] remained confined to his distant, removed, passive role and the place of sovereign god was occupied by [[Varuna]] and [[Mitra]]. In Greek and Roman religion, instead, the homonymous gods ''*Diou-'' and ''Δι[[digamma|ϝ]]-'' evolved into atmospheric deities; by their mastery of thunder and lightning, they expressed themselves and made their will known to the community. In Rome, Jupiter also sent signs to the leaders of the state in the form of [[auspices]] in addition to thunder. The art of [[augury]] was considered prestigious by ancient Romans; by sending his signs, Jupiter (the sovereign of heaven) communicates his advice to his terrestrial colleague: the king (''rex'') or his successor magistrates. The encounter between the heavenly and political, legal aspects of the deity are well represented by the prerogatives, privileges, functions and taboos proper to his ''[[flamen]]'' (the ''[[flamen Dialis]]'' and his wife, the ''flaminica Dialis'').

Dumézil maintains that Jupiter is not himself a god of war and agriculture, although his actions and interest may extend to these spheres of human endeavour. His view is based on the methodological assumption that the chief criterion for studying a god's nature is not to consider his field of action, but the quality, method and features of his action. Consequently, the analysis of the type of action performed by Jupiter in the domains in which he operates indicates that Jupiter is a sovereign god who may act in the field of politics (as well as agriculture and war) in his capacity as such, i.e. in a way and with the features proper to a king. Sovereignty is expressed through the two aspects of absolute, magic power (epitomised and represented by the Vedic god [[Varuna]]) and lawful right (by the Vedic god [[Mitra]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil above p. 239; It. Tr. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; However, sovereignty permits action in every field; otherwise, it would lose its essential quality. As a further proof, Dumézil cites the story of Tullus Hostilius (the most belligerent of the Roman kings), who was killed by Jupiter with a lightning bolt (indicating that he did not enjoy the god's favour). 
Varro's definition of Jupiter as the god who has under his jurisdiction the full expression of every being (''penes Iovem sunt summa'') reflects the sovereign nature of the god, as opposed to the jurisdiction of Janus (god of passages and change) on their beginning (''penes Ianum sunt prima'').&lt;ref&gt;Varro apud Augustine ''De Civitate Dei VII 9.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to other gods==

===Capitoline Triad===
{{See also|Capitoline Triad}}
[[File:Arte romana, triade capitolina, 160-180 dc (guidonia montecelio, museo civico archeologico) 01.jpg|thumb|left|Capitoline Triad|alt=Statue of three figures, seated side by side]]
The Capitoline Triad was introduced to Rome by the Tarquins. Dumézil&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 274 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; thinks it might have been an Etruscan (or local) creation based on Vitruvius' treatise on architecture, in which the three deities are associated as the most important. It is possible that the Etruscans paid particular attention to [[Menrva]] (Minerva) as a goddess of destiny, in addition to the royal couple Uni (Juno) and Tinia (Jupiter).&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil ARR above p. 271 citing Ovid ''Fasti'' III 815–832.&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, Minerva later assumed a military aspect under the influence of [[Athena Pallas]] (Polias). Dumézil argues that with the advent of the Republic, Jupiter became the only king of Rome, no longer merely the first of the great gods.

====Archaic Triad====
{{Main|Archaic Triad}}
The Archaic Triad is a hypothetical theological structure (or system) consisting of the gods Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus. It was first described by Wissowa,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=23, 133–134}};  Dumézil ''Jupiter Mars Quirinus'' I-IV Paris 1941–1948; ARR above pp.  137–165.&lt;/ref&gt; and the concept was developed further by Dumézil. The three-function hypothesis of [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European society]] advanced by Dumézil holds that in prehistory, society was divided into three classes (priests, warriors and craftsmen) which had as their religious counterparts the divine figures of the sovereign god, the warrior god and the civil god. The sovereign function (embodied by Jupiter) entailed omnipotence; thence, a domain extended over every aspect of nature and life. The colour relating to the sovereign function is white.

The three functions are interrelated with one another, overlapping to some extent; the sovereign function, although essentially religious in nature, is involved in many ways in areas pertaining to the other two. Therefore, Jupiter is the "magic player" in the founding of the Roman state and the fields of war, agricultural plenty, human fertility and wealth.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 172 and 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

This hypothesis has not found widespread support among scholars.

===Jupiter and Minerva===
Apart from being protectress of the arts and craft as Minerva Capta, who was brought from Falerii, Minerva's association to Jupiter and relevance to Roman state religion is mainly linked to the [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|Palladium]], a wooden statue of Athena that could move the eyes and wave the spear. It was stored in the ''penus interior'', inner penus of the ''aedes Vestae'', temple of Vesta and considered the most important among the ''[[pignora imperii]]'', pawns of dominion, empire.&lt;ref&gt;E. Montanari ''Mito e Storia nell' annalistica romana delle origini'' Roma 1990 pp. 73 ff.; citing Cicero ''Pro Scauro 48: "''pignus nostrae salutis atque imperii''"; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem II 188, 16: "''Illic imperium fore ubi et Palladium''"; Festus s.v. p. 152 L.&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman traditional lore it was brought from Troy by Aeneas.  Scholars though think it was last taken to Rome in the third or second century BC.&lt;ref&gt;E. Montanari above citing M. Sordi "Lavinio, Roma e il Palladio" in ''CISA'' '''8''' 1982 p. 74 ff.; W. Vollgraf "Le Palladium de Rome" in ''BAB'' 1938 pp. 34 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juno and Fortuna===

The divine couple received from Greece its matrimonial implications, thence bestowing on [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] the role of tutelary goddess of marriage (''Iuno Pronuba'').

The couple itself though cannot be reduced to a Greek apport. The association of Juno and Jupiter is of the most ancient Latin theology.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil "Déesses latines et mythes vediques. III Fortuna Primigenia" in ''Coll. Latomus'' '''25''' 1956 pp. 71–78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Praeneste]] offers a glimpse into original Latin mythology: the local goddess [[Fortuna]] is represented as milking two infants, one male and one female, namely Jove (Jupiter) and Juno.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De nat. Deor.'' II 85-86: "Is est locus saeptus religiose propter Iovis pueri, qui lactens cum Iunone in gremio sedens, mamma appetens, castissime colitur a matribus": "This is an enclosed place for religious reasons because of Iupiter child, who is seated on the womb with Juno suckling, directed towards the breast, very chastely worshipped by mothers".&lt;/ref&gt; It seems fairly safe to assume that from the earliest times they were identified by their own proper names and since they got them they were never changed through the course of history: they were called Jupiter and Juno. These gods were the most ancient deities of every Latin town. Praeneste preserved divine filiation and infancy as the sovereign god and his paredra Juno have a mother who is the primordial goddess Fortuna Primigenia.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ''Déesses latines et mythes vediques'' p. 96 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Many terracotta statuettes have been discovered which represent a woman with a child: one of them represents exactly the scene described by Cicero of a woman with two children of different sex who touch her breast. Two of the votive inscriptions to Fortuna associate her and Jupiter: " Fortunae Iovi puero..." and "Fortunae Iovis puero..."&lt;ref&gt;CIL XIV 2868 and 2862 (mutile).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882 though R. Mowat published an inscription in which Fortuna is called ''daughter of Jupiter'', raising new questions and opening new perspectives in the theology of Latin gods.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mowat "Inscription latine sur plaque de bronze acquise à Rome par par M. A. Dutuit"  in ''Mem. de la Soc. nat. des Antiquités de France'' 5me Ser. 3  '''43''' 1882 p. 200: CIL XIV 2863: ORCEVIA NUMERI/ NATIONU CRATIA/  FORTUNA DIOVO FILEA/ PRIMOCENIA/ DONOM DEDI. Cited by G. Dumezil above p. 71 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumezil has elaborated an interpretative theory according to which this ''aporia'' would be an intrinsic, fundamental feature of Indoeuropean deities of the primordial and sovereign level, as it finds a parallel in Vedic religion.&lt;ref&gt;G Dumezil ''Déesses latines et mythes vediques'' Bruxelles 1956 chapt. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The contradiction would put Fortuna both at the origin of time and into its ensuing diachronic process: it is the comparison offered by Vedic deity [[Aditi]], the ''Not-Bound'' or ''Enemy of Bondage'', that shows that there is no question of choosing one of the two apparent options: as the mother of the [[Aditya]] she has the same type of relationship with one of his sons, [[Dakṣa]], the minor sovereign. who represents the ''Creative Energy'', being at the same time his mother and daughter, as is true for the whole group of sovereign gods to which she belongs.&lt;ref&gt;Ṛg-Veda X 72, 4-5; G. Dumezil above and ''Mariages indo-européens'' pp. 311–312: "Of Aditi Daksa was born, and of Daksa Aditi, o Daksa, she who is your daughter".&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Aditi is thus one of the heirs (along with [[Savitr]]) of the opening god of the Indoiranians, as she is represented with her head on her two sides, with the two faces looking opposite directions.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ''Déesses latines...'' p. 91 n.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The mother of the sovereign gods has thence two solidal but distinct modalities of duplicity, i.e. of having two foreheads and a double position in the genealogy. Angelo Brelich has interpreted this theology as the basic opposition between the primordial absence of order (chaos) and the organisation of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;A. Brelich ''Tre variazioni romane sul tema delle origini. I. Roma e Preneste. Una polemica religiosa nell'Italia antica'' Pubbl. dell'Univ. di Roma 1955–1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Janus===
{{Main|Janus}}
The relation of Jupiter to Janus is problematic. Varro defines Jupiter as the god who has ''potestas'' (power) over the forces by which anything happens in the world. Janus, however, has the privilege of being invoked first in rites, since in his power are the beginnings of things (''prima''), the appearance of Jupiter included.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 101 and 290. Discussed at length by Augustine, ''City of God'' VII 9 and 10. Also Ovid ''Fasti'' I 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saturn===
{{Main|Saturn (mythology)}}
The [[Latini|Latins]] considered Saturn the predecessor of Jupiter. Saturn reigned in [[Latium]] during a mythical [[Golden Age]] reenacted every year at the festival of [[Saturnalia]]. Saturn also retained primacy in matters of agriculture and money. Unlike the Greek tradition of [[Cronus]] and Zeus, the usurpation of Saturn as king of the gods by Jupiter was not viewed by the Latins as violent or hostile; Saturn continued to be revered in his temple at the foot of the Capitol Hill, which maintained the alternative name ''Saturnius'' into the time of Varro.&lt;ref&gt;D. Briquel "Jupiter, Saturne et le Capitol" in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''198''' 2. 1981 pp. 131–162; Varro V 42;  Vergil ''Aeneis''  VIII 357-8;  Dionysius Hal. I 34; Solinus I 12; Festus p. 322 L; Tertullian ''Apologeticum'' 10; Macrobius I 7, 27 and I 10, 4 citing a certain Mallius. See also Macrobius I 7, 3: the annalistic tradition attributed its foundation to king Tullus Hostilius. Studies by E. Gjerstad in ''Mélanges Albert Grenier'' Bruxelles 1962 pp. 757–762; Filippo Coarelli in ''La Parola del Passato'' '''174''' 1977 p. 215 f.&lt;/ref&gt;
A. Pasqualini has argued that Saturn was related to ''Iuppiter Latiaris'', the old Jupiter of the Latins, as the original figure of this Jupiter was superseded on the Alban Mount, whereas it preserved its gruesome character in the ceremony held at the sanctuary of the Latiar Hill in Rome which involved a human sacrifice and the aspersion of the statue of the god with the blood of the victim.&lt;ref&gt;A. Pasqualini "Note sull'ubicazione del Latiar" in ''MEFRA'' '''111''' 1999 2 p[. 784–785 citing M. Malavolta "I ''ludi'' delle ''feriae Latinae'' a Roma" in A. Pasqualini (ed.) ''Alba Longa. Mito storia archeologia. Atti dell'incontro di studio, Roma-Albano laziale 27-29 gennaio 1994'' Roma 1996 pp. 257–273; Eusebius ''De laude Constantini'' 13, 7 = MPG XX col. 1403–1404; J. Rives "Human sacrifice among Pagans and Christians" in ''Journal of Roman Studies'' LXXXV 1995 pp. 65–85;  Iustinus ''Apologeticum'' II 12, 4–5; G. Pucci "Saturno: il lato oscuro" in ''Lares'' LVIII 1992 p. 5-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fides===
{{Main|Fides (mythology)}} 
The abstract [[personification]] Fides ("Faith, Trust") was one of the oldest gods associated with Jupiter. As guarantor of public faith, Fides had her temple on the Capitol (near that of Capitoline Jupiter).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=100–101}}; G. Dumézil above p. 348; Cicero ''De Natura Deorum'' II 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dius Fidius===
{{Main|Dius Fidius}}
''Dius Fidius'' is considered a [[theonym]] for Jupiter,&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ''La religion Romaine archaïque'' Paris, 1974; It. tr. Milan 1977 p.189.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes a separate entity also known in Rome as [[Sancus|Semo Sancus]] Dius Fidius. Wissowa argued that while Jupiter is the god of the ''Fides Publica Populi Romani'' as ''Iuppiter Lapis'' (by whom important oaths are sworn), Dius Fidius is a deity established for everyday use and was charged with the protection of good faith in private affairs. Dius Fidius would thus correspond to ''Zeus Pistios''.{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=103}} The association with Jupiter may be a matter of divine relation; some scholars see him as a form of Hercules.&lt;ref&gt;Roger D. Woodard ''Vedic and Indo-European Sacred Space'' Chicago Illinois Un. Press 2005 p. 189. The scholar thinks Dius Fidius is the Roman equivalent of Trita Apya, the companion of Indra in the slaying of Vrtra.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Jupiter and Dius Fidius were wardens of oaths and wielders of lightning bolts; both required an opening in the roof of their temples.&lt;ref name="G. Dumézil ARR above p. 169"/&gt;

The functionality of Sancus occurs consistently within the sphere of ''fides'', oaths and respect for contracts and of the divine-sanction guarantee against their breach. Wissowa suggested that Semo Sancus is the ''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]'' of Jupiter,&lt;ref name="Roschers Lexicon' 1912, p. 131"&gt;G. Wissowa in ''Roschers Lexicon'' 1909 s.v. Semo Sancus col. 3654; ''Religion und Kultus der Römer'' Munich, 1912, p. 131 f.&lt;/ref&gt; but the concept of a deity's ''genius'' is a development of the Imperial period.&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Fowler ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' London, 1899, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some aspects of the oath-ritual for Dius Fidius (such as proceedings under the open sky or in the ''compluvium'' of private residences), and the fact the temple of Sancus had no roof, suggest that the oath sworn by Dius Fidius predated that for ''Iuppiter Lapis'' or ''Iuppiter Feretrius''.&lt;ref&gt;O. Sacchi "Il trivaso del Quirinale" in ''Revue Internationale de Droit de l'Antiquité '' 2001 pp. 309–311, citing Nonius Marcellus s.v. rituis (L p. 494): ''Itaque domi rituis nostri, qui per dium Fidium iurare vult, prodire solet in compluvium.'', 'thus according to our rites he who wishes to swear an oath by Dius Fidius he as a rule walks to the ''compluvium'' (an unroofed space within the house)'; Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 11, 5 on the use of the private ''mensa'' as an altar mentioned in the ''ius Papirianum''; Granius Flaccus ''indigitamenta'' 8 (H. 109) on king Numa's vow by which he asked for the divine punishment of perjury by all the gods.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genius===
{{Main|Genius (mythology)}}

Augustine quotes Varro who explains the ''genius'' as "the god who is in charge and has the power to generate everything" and "the rational spirit of all (therefore, everyone has their own)". Augustine concludes that Jupiter should be considered the ''genius'' of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine CD VII 13, referencing also [[Quintus Valerius Soranus]]. H. Wagenvoort "''Genius'' a ''genendo''" ''Mnemosyne'' 4. Suppl., 4, 1951, pp. 163–168. G. Dumézil ARR above p. 315, discussing G. Wissowa and K. Latte' s opinions.&lt;/ref&gt;

G. Wissowa advanced the hypothesis that Semo [[Sancus]] is the genius of Jupiter.&lt;ref name="Roschers Lexicon' 1912, p. 131" /&gt; W. W. Fowler has cautioned that this interpretation looks to be an anachronism and it would only be acceptable to say that Sancus is a ''Genius Iovius'', as it appears from the Iguvine Tables.&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Fowler ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' London, 1899, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Censorinus cites [[Granius Flaccus]] as saying that "the Genius was the same entity as the Lar" in his lost work ''De Indigitamentis''.&lt;ref&gt;Censorinus ''De Die Natali'' 3, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; probably referring to the ''[[Lar Familiaris]]''. [[Mutunus Tutunus]] had his shrine at the foot of the Velian Hill near those of the Di Penates and of Vica Pota, who were among the most ancient gods of the Roman community of according to Wissowa.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa ''Kultus'' 1912 p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumézil opines that the attribution of a Genius to the gods should be earlier than its first attestation of 58 BC, in an inscription which mentions the ''Iovis Genius''.&lt;ref&gt;CIL IX 3513 from the ''lex templi'' of the temple of ''Iuppiter Liber '' at Furfo, Samnium.&lt;/ref&gt;

A connection between Genius and Jupiter seems apparent in [[Plautus]]' comedy ''[[Amphitryon]]'', in which Jupiter takes up the looks of [[Alcmene|Alcmena]]'s husband in order to seduce her: J. Hubeaux sees there a reflection of the story that [[Scipio Africanus]]' mother conceived him with a snake that was in fact Jupiter transformed.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius ''Noctes Atticae'' VI 1, 6. Silius Italicus ''Punica'' XIII 400-413. Cited by G. Dumézil ARR above p. 435, referencing J. Hubeaux ''Les grands mythes de Rome'' Paris 1945 pp. 81–82 and J. Aymard "Scipion l' Africain et les chiens du Capitol" in ''Revue d'études latins'' '''31''' 1953 pp. 111–116.&lt;/ref&gt; Scipio himself claimed that only he would rise to the mansion of the gods through the widest gate.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De Republica'' VI 13: = ''[[Somnium Scipionis]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Etruscan ''Penates'' there is a ''Genius Iovialis'' who comes after ''Fortuna'' and ''Ceres'' and before ''Pales''.&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' IV 40, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Genius Iovialis is one of the ''Penates'' of the humans and not of Jupiter though, as these were located in region I of Martianus Capella' s division of Heaven, while Genius appears in regions V and VI along with Ceres, Favor (possibly a Roman approximation to an Etruscan male manifestation of Fortuna) and Pales.&lt;ref&gt;G. Capdeville "Les dieux de Martianus Capella" in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''213''' 1996 3. p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; This is in accord with the definition of the Penates of man being Fortuna, Ceres, Pales and Genius Iovialis and the statement in Macrobius that the Larentalia were dedicated to Jupiter as the god whence the souls of men come from and to whom they return after death.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius I 10, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summanus===
{{Main|Summanus}}
The god of nighttime lightning has been interpreted as an aspect of Jupiter, either a [[chthonic]] manifestation of the god or a separate god of the underworld. A statue of Summanus stood on the roof of the Temple of Capitoline Jupiter, and ''Iuppiter Summanus'' is one of the epithets of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;E. and A. L. Prosdocimi in ''Etrennes M. Lejeune'' Paris 1978 pp. 199–207 identify him as an aspect of Jupiter. See also A. L.  Prosdocimi "'Etimologie di teonimi: Venilia, Summano, Vacuna" in ''Studi linguistici in onore di Vittore Pisani '' Milano 1969 pp. 777–802.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil sees the opposition Dius Fidius versus Summanus as complementary, interpreting it as typical to the inherent ambiguity of the sovereign god exemplified by that of Mitra and Varuna in Vedic religion.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 184–185 citing his ''Mitra Varuna, essai sur deux représentations indo-européennes de la souveraineté'' Paris 1940–1948.&lt;/ref&gt; The complementarity of the epithets is shown in inscriptions found on ''puteal''s or ''bidental''s reciting either ''fulgur Dium conditum''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=107}}, citing CIL VI 205; X 49 and 6423.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''fulgur Summanum conditum'' in places struck by daytime versus nighttime lightning bolts respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912}}, CIL VI 206.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also consistent with the etymology of ''Summanus'', deriving from ''sub'' and ''mane'' (the time before morning).&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liber===
{{See also|Liber}}
''Iuppiter'' was associated with [[Liber]] through his epithet of ''Liber'' (association not yet been fully explained by scholars, due to the scarcity of early documentation).
In the past, it was maintained that Liber was only a progressively-detached [[wikt:hypostasis|hypostasis]] of Jupiter; consequently, the vintage festivals were to be attributed only to ''Iuppiter Liber''.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Preller ''Rõmische Mythologie'' I Berlin 1881 pp. 195–197; E. Aust s. v. Iuppiter (Liber) in ''Roscher lexicon'' II column 661 f.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a hypothesis was rejected as groundless by Wissowa, although he was a supporter of Liber's Jovian origin.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier de Cazanove cites {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=120}} and A. Schnegelsberg ''De Liberi apud Romanos cultu capita duo'' Dissertation Marburg 1895 p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Olivier de Cazanove&lt;ref&gt;O. de Cazanove "Jupiter, Liber et le vin latin" in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''205''' 1988 3 p. 247 n. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  contends that it is difficult to admit that Liber (who is present in the oldest calendars—those of Numa—in the ''Liberalia'' and in the month of ''Liber'' at Lavinium)&lt;ref name="CDVII21"&gt;Augustine CD VII 21.&lt;/ref&gt; was derived from another deity. Such a derivation would find support only in epigraphic documents, primarily from the Osco-Sabellic area.&lt;ref&gt;Inscriptions from the territory of the Frentani  (Zvetaieff  ''Sylloge inscriptionum Oscarum'' nr. 3); Vestini (CIL IX 3513; I 2nd 756 Furfo); Sabini  (Jordan  ''Analecta epigraphica latina'' p. 3 f.= CIL I 2nd 1838) and Campani  (CIL X 3786 ''Iovi Liber(o)'' Capua).&lt;/ref&gt; Wissowa sets the position of ''Iuppiter Liber'' within the framework of an agrarian Jupiter. The god also had a temple in this name on the Aventine in Rome, which was restored by Augustus and dedicated on September 1. Here, the god was sometimes named ''Liber''&lt;ref&gt;Fasti Arvales ad 1. September.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes ''Libertas''.&lt;ref&gt;Monumentum Ancyranum IV 7; CIL XI 657 Faventia; XIV 2579 Tusculum.&lt;/ref&gt; Wissowa opines that the relationship existed in the concept of creative abundance through which the supposedly-separate Liber might have been connected{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=106}} to the Greek god [[Dionysos]], although both deities might not have been originally related to [[viticulture]].

Other scholars assert that there was no Liber (other than a god of wine) within historical memory.&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Bömer ''Untersuchungen über die Religion der Sklaven in Griechenland und Rom'' I Wiesbaden 1957 p. 127 f. cited by Olivier de Cazanove "Jupiter, Liber et le vin" in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''205''' 1988 3 p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; O. de Cazanove&lt;ref&gt;O. de Cazanove above p. 248 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the domain of the sovereign god Jupiter was that of sacred, sacrificial wine (''vinum inferium''),&lt;ref&gt;[[Trebatius Testa]] apud Arnobius ''Ad nationes'' VII 31: "''solum quod inferetur sacrum...''" "only that which is spilt is considered sacred...";also Cato ''De Agri Cultura'' CXXXII 2; CXXXIV 3; Servius IX 641; Isidore XX 2,7.&lt;/ref&gt; while that of Liber and Libera was confined to secular wine (''vinum spurcum'');&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Antistius Labeo]] apud Festus s. v., p. 474 L.&lt;/ref&gt; these two types were obtained through differing fermentation processes. The offer of wine to Liber was made possible by naming the ''mustum'' (grape juice) stored in [[amphora]]s ''sacrima''.&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Altheim ''Terra Mater'' Giessen 1931 p. 22 and n. 4 while acknowledging the obscurity of the etymology of this word proposed the derivation from ''sacerrima'' as ''bruma'' from ''brevissima''; ''Onomata Latina et Graeca'' s.v.:  ''novum vinum''; ''Corpus Glossatorum Latinorum'' II p. 264: απαρχη γλεύκους.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sacred wine was obtained by the natural fermentation of juice of grapes free from flaws of any type, religious (e. g. those struck by lightning, brought into contact with corpses or wounded people or coming from an unfertilised grapeyard) or secular (by "cutting" it with old wine). Secular (or "profane") wine was obtained through several types of manipulation (e.g.  by adding honey, or ''mulsum''; using raisins, or ''passum''; by boiling, or ''defrutum''). However, the ''sacrima'' used for the offering to the two gods for the preservation of grapeyards, vessels and wine&lt;ref&gt;Columella ''De Re Rustica'' XII 18, 4 mentions a sacrifice to Liber and Libera immediately before.&lt;/ref&gt; was obtained only by pouring the juice into amphors after pressing.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus s. v. sacrima p. 423 L; Festus p. 422 L (mutile).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''mustum'' was considered ''spurcum'' (dirty), and thus unusable in sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Isidore ''Origines'' XX 3, 4; Enrico Monatanari "Funzione della sovranitá e feste del vino nella Roma repubblicana" in ''Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni'' '''49''' 1983 pp. 242–262.&lt;/ref&gt; The amphor (itself not an item of sacrifice) permitted presentation of its content on a table or could be added to a sacrifice; this happened at the ''auspicatio vindamiae'' for the first grape&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil "Quaestiunculae indo-italicae" 14-16 in  ''Revue d' études latins'' XXXIX 1961 pp. 261–274.&lt;/ref&gt;  and for ears of corn of the ''praemetium'' on a dish (''lanx'') at the
temple of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]].&lt;ref&gt;Henri Le Bonniec ''Le culte de Cérès à Rome'' Paris 1958 pp. 160–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumézil, on the other hand, sees the relationship between Jupiter and Liber as grounded in the social and political relevance of the two gods (who were both considered patrons of freedom).&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 331–332.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Liberalia'' of March were, since earliest times, the occasion for the ceremony of the donning of the ''toga virilis'' or ''libera''  (which marked the passage into adult citizenship by young people). Augustine relates that these festivals had a particularly obscene character:  a ''phallus'' was taken to the fields on a cart, and then back in triumph to town. In [[Lavinium]] they lasted a month, during which the population enjoyed bawdy jokes. The most honest ''matronae'' were supposed to publicly crown the ''phallus'' with flowers, to ensure a good harvest and repeal the ''fascinatio'' (evil eye).&lt;ref name="CDVII21" /&gt; In Rome representations of the sex organs were placed in the temple of the couple ''Liber Libera'', who presided over the male and female components of generation and the "liberation" of the semen.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine CD VII 3, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This complex of rites and beliefs shows that the divine couple's jurisdiction extended over fertility in general, not only that of grapes. The etymology of  ''Liber'' (archaic form ''Loifer, Loifir'') was explained by Émile Benveniste as formed on the IE theme *leudh- plus the suffix -es-; its original meaning is "the one of germination, he who ensures the sprouting of crops".&lt;ref&gt;"Liber et liberi" in ''Revue d'études latins'' '''14''' 1936 pp. 52–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship of Jupiter with freedom was a common belief among the Roman people, as demonstrated by the dedication of the ''Mons Sacer'' to the god after the first secession of the ''plebs''. Later inscriptions also show the unabated popular belief in Jupiter as bestower of freedom in the imperial era.&lt;ref&gt;"''...curatores Iovi Libertati''" CIL XI 657 and "''Iovi Obsequenti publice''" CIL XI 658 from [[Bagnacavallo]]; "''Iuppiter Impetrabilis''" from Cremella sopra [[Monza]] published by G. Zecchini in ''Rivista di studi italiani e latini'' '''110''' 1976 pp. 178–182. The double presence of Jupiter and [[Feronia (goddess)|Feronia]] at Bagnacavallo has led to speculation that the servile ''[[manumissio]]'' (legal ritual action by which slaves were freed)  was practised in this sanctuary : Giancarlo Susini "San Pietro in Sylvis, santuario pagense e villaggio plebano nel Ravennate" in ''Mélanges offertes à G. Sanders'' Steenbrugge 1991 pp. 395–400. Cited in F. Cenerini above p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veiove===
{{Main|Vejovis}}
Scholars have been often puzzled by Ve(d)iove (or [[Veiovis]], or Vedius) and unwilling to discuss his identity, claiming our knowledge of this god is insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR It. tr. p. 188 n. 44; Kurt Latte  ''Römische Religionsgeschichte'' Munich 1960 p. 81 and n. 3.; W. Warde Fowler ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' London 1899 pp. 121–122.&lt;/ref&gt; Most, however, agree that Veiove is a sort of special Jupiter or anti-Iove, or even an underworld Jupiter. In other words, Veiove is indeed the Capitoline god himself, who takes up a different, diminished appearance (''iuvenis'' and ''parvus'', young and gracile), in order to be able to discharge sovereign functions over places, times and spheres that by their own nature are excluded from the direct control of Jupiter as Optimus Maximus.&lt;ref&gt;G. Piccaluga "L' anti-Iupiter" in ''Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni'' XXXIV 1963 p. 229-236; E. Gierstad "Veiovis, a pre-indoeuropean God in Rome?" in ''Opuscola Romana'' 9, 4 1973 pp. 35–42.&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion is based on information provided by Gellius,&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius V 12.&lt;/ref&gt; who states his name is formed by adding prefix ''ve'' (here denoting "deprivation" or "negation") to ''Iove '' (whose name Gellius posits as rooted in the verb ''iuvo'' "I benefit"). D. Sabbatucci has stressed the feature of bearer of instability and antithesis to cosmic order of the god, who threatens the kingly power of Jupiter as ''Stator'' and ''Centumpeda'' and whose presence occurs side by side to Janus' on January 1, but also his function of helper to the growth of the young Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;D. Sabbatucci above as summarised by R. Turcan above p. 70 and pp. 72–73. On the aspect of making Jupiter grow up Turcan cites the denarii struck by [[Manius Fonteius]] and [[Valerian the younger]] of the type ''Iovi crescenti'' mentioned by [[A. Alföldi]] in ''Studien zur Geschichte der Weltkrisedes 3. Jhd. n.Chr.'' Darmstadt 1067 p. 112 f.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858 [[Ludwig Preller]] suggested that Veiovis may be the sinister double of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Preller ''Römische Mythologie'' I p. 262 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, the god (under the name ''Vetis'') is placed in the last case (number 16) of the outer rim of the Piacenza Liver—before ''Cilens'' (Nocturnus), who ends (or begins in the Etruscan vision) the disposition of the gods. In [[Martianus Capella]]'s division of heaven, he is found in region XV with the ''dii publici''; as such, he numbers among the infernal (or antipodal) gods. The location of his two temples in Rome—near those of Jupiter (one on the Capitoline Hill, in the low between the ''arx'' and the Capitolium, between the two groves where the [[asylum (antiquity)|asylum]] founded by Romulus stood, the other on the Tiber Island near that of  ''Iuppiter Iurarius'', later also known as temple of Aesculapius)&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' I 291–294.&lt;/ref&gt;—may be significant in this respect, along with the fact that he is considered the father&lt;ref&gt;Ferruccio Bernini ''Ovidio. I Fasti'' (translation and commentary), III 429; Bologna 1983 (reprint).&lt;/ref&gt; of Apollo, perhaps because he was depicted carrying arrows. He is also considered to be the unbearded Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius ''De Architectura'' IV 8, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The dates of his festivals support the same conclusion: they fall on January 1,&lt;ref&gt;Ovid above. Fasti Praenestini CIL I 2nd p. 231: ''Aescu]lapio Vediovi in insula''.&lt;/ref&gt; March 7&lt;ref&gt;Fasti Praen.: ''Non. Mart. F(as)...]ovi artis Vediovis inter duos lucos''; Ovid ''Fasti'' III 429–430.&lt;/ref&gt; and May 21,&lt;ref&gt;Ovid above V 721–722. ''XII Kal. Iun. NP Agonia'' (Esq. Caer. Ven. Maff.); ''Vediovi'' (Ven.).&lt;/ref&gt; the first date being the recurrence of the [[Agonalia]], dedicated to Janus and celebrated by the king with the sacrifice of a ram. The nature of the sacrifice is debated; Gellius states ''capra'', a female goat, although some scholars posit a ram. This sacrifice occurred ''rito humano'', which may mean "with the rite appropriate for human sacrifice".&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa on the grounds of Paulus's glossa ''humanum sacrificium'' p. 91 L interprets "with a rite proper to a ceremony in honour of the deceased". G. Piccaluga at n. 15 and 21 pp. 231-232 though remarks that Gellius does not state ''sacrificium humanum'' but only states...''immolaturque ritu humano capra''.&lt;/ref&gt; Gellius concludes by stating that this god is one of those who receive sacrifices so as to persuade them to refrain from causing harm.

The arrow is an ambivalent symbol; it was used in the ritual of the [[devotio]] (the general who vowed had to stand on an arrow).&lt;ref&gt;Livy VIII 9, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is perhaps because of the arrow and of the juvenile looks that Gellius identifies Veiove with Apollo&lt;ref&gt;Gellius V 12, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a god who must receive worship in order to obtain his abstention from harming men, along with [[Robigus]] and [[Averruncus]].&lt;ref&gt;Gellius V 12. The Romans knew and offered a cult to other such deities: among them ''Febris'', ''Tussis'', ''Mefitis''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ambivalence in the identity of Veiove is apparent in the fact that while he is present in places and times which may have a negative connotation (such as the ''asylum'' of Romulus in between the two groves on the Capitol, the Tiberine island along with Faunus and Aesculapius, the kalends of January, the nones of March, and May 21, a statue of his nonetheless stands in the ''arx''. Moreover, the initial particle ''ve-'' which the ancient supposed were part of his name is itself ambivalent as it may have both an accrescitive and diminutive value.&lt;ref&gt;G. Piccaluga "L' anti-Juppiter" in ''Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni'' XXXIV 1963 p. 233-234 and notes 30, 31 citing Gellius V 12 and Pliny the Elder ''Naturalis Historia''  XVI 216: "''Non et simulacrum Veiovis in arce?''".&lt;/ref&gt;

Maurice Besnier has remarked that a temple to ''Iuppiter'' was dedicated by ''praetor'' Lucius Furius Purpureo before the [[Battle of Cremona (200 BC)|battle of Cremona]] against the [[Cenomani (Cisalpine Gaul)|Celtic Cenomani of Cisalpine Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy XXXI 21.&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription found at [[Brescia]] in 1888 shows that ''Iuppiter Iurarius'' was worshipped there&lt;ref&gt;Ettore Pais CIL ''Supplementa Italica'' I ''addimenta al CIL V'' in ''Atti dei Lincei, Memorie'' V 1888 n. 1272: ''I O M IUR D(e) C(onscriptorum) S(ententia)''.&lt;/ref&gt; and one found on the south tip of Tiber Island in 1854 that there was a cult to the god on the spot too.&lt;ref&gt;CIL I 1105: ''C. Volcaci C.  F Har. de stipe Iovi Iurario... onimentum''.&lt;/ref&gt; Besnier speculates that Lucius Furius had evoked the chief god of the enemy and built a temple to him in Rome outside the ''pomerium''. On January 1, the ''Fasti Praenestini'' record the festivals of Aesculapius and Vediove on the Island, while in the ''Fasti'' Ovid speaks of ''Jupiter'' and his grandson.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' I 291–295.&lt;/ref&gt; Livy records that in 192 BC, ''duumvir'' Q. Marcus Ralla dedicated to Jupiter on the Capitol the two temples promised by L. Furius Purpureo, one of which was that promised during the war against the Gauls.&lt;ref&gt;Livy XXXV 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Besnier would accept a correction to Livy's passage (proposed by Jordan) to read ''aedes Veiovi'' instead of ''aedes duae Iovi''.  Such a correction concerns the temples dedicated on the Capitol: it does not address the question of the dedication of the temple on the Island, which is puzzling, since the place is attested epigraphically as dedicated to the cult of  ''Iuppiter Iurarius'', in the ''Fasti Praenestini'' of ''Vediove''&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. above: "''Aeculapio Vediovi in insula''".&lt;/ref&gt; and to Jupiter according to Ovid. The two gods may have been seen as equivalent: ''Iuppiter Iurarius'' is an awesome and vengeful god, parallel to the Greek ''Zeus Orkios'', the avenger of perjury.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Besnier "Jupiter Jurarius" in ''Mélanges d'archéologie et d' histoire'' '''18''' 1898 pp. 287–289.&lt;/ref&gt;

A. Pasqualini has argued that Veiovis seems related to ''Iuppiter Latiaris'', as the original figure of this Jupiter would have been superseded on the Alban Mount, whereas it preserved its gruesome character in the ceremony held on the sanctuary of the Latiar Hill, the southernmost hilltop of the [[Quirinal]] in Rome, which involved a human sacrifice. The [[gens Iulia]] had gentilician cults at [[Bovillae]] where a dedicatory inscription to Vediove has been found in 1826 on an ara.&lt;ref&gt;CIL XIV 2387 = ILS 2988 = ILLRP 270=CIL I 807: ''Vediovei patrei genteiles Iuliei leege Albana dicata''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pasqualini it was a deity similar to Vediove, wielder of lightningbolts and chthonic, who was connected to the cult of the founders who first inhabited the Alban Mount and built the sanctuary. Such a cult once superseded on the Mount would have been taken up and preserved by the Iulii, private citizens bound to the ''sacra Albana'' by their Alban origin.&lt;ref&gt;A. Pasqualini "Le basi documenatarie della ''leggenda'' di Alba Longa" Universita' di Roma Torvergata 2012 online.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria===
{{See also|Victoria (mythology)}}
[[File:RSC 0009.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Coin with [[Laurel wreath|laureate]] head of Jupiter ([[Obverse and reverse|obverse]]) and (reverse) Victory, standing ("''ROMA''" below in [[relief]])|alt=Roman coin, with bearded head on front and standing figure on reverse]]
Victoria was connected to ''Iuppiter Victor'' in his role as bestower of military victory. Jupiter, as a sovereign god, was considered as having the power to conquer anyone and anything in a supernatural way; his contribution to military victory was different from that of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] (god of military valour). Victoria appears first on the reverse of coins representing Venus (driving the quadriga of Jupiter, with her head crowned and with a palm in her hand) during the first Punic War.  Sometimes, she is represented walking and carrying a trophy.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

A temple was dedicated to the goddess afterwards on the Palatine, testifying to her high station in the Roman mind. When [[Hieron of Syracuse]] presented a golden statuette of the goddess to Rome, the Senate had it placed in the temple of Capitoline Jupiter among the greatest (and most sacred) deities.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 413. Livy XXVII 2, 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although Victoria played a significant role in the religious ideology of the late Republic and the Empire, she is undocumented in earlier times. A function similar to hers may have been played by the little-known [[Vica Pota]].

===Terminus===
{{See also|Terminus (god)}}
Juventas and Terminus were the gods who, according to legend,&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Rom. Antiquities''  III 69, 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; refused to leave their sites on the Capitol when the construction of the temple of Jupiter was undertaken. Therefore, they had to be reserved a ''sacellum'' within the new temple. Their stubbornness was considered a good omen; it would guarantee youth, stability and safety to Rome on its site.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus above III 69; Florus I 7, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; This legend is generally thought by scholars to indicate their strict connection with Jupiter. An inscription found near [[Ravenna]] reads ''Iuppiter Ter.'',&lt;ref&gt;CIL XI 351.&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that Terminus is an aspect of Jupiter.

Terminus is the god of boundaries (public and private), as he is portrayed in literature. The religious value of the [[boundary marker]] is documented by Plutarch,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''Numa'' 16.&lt;/ref&gt; who ascribes to king Numa the construction of temples to Fides and Terminus and the delimitation of Roman territory. Ovid gives a vivid description of the rural rite at a boundary of fields of neighbouring peasants on February 23 (the day of the [[Terminus (mythology)#Worship|Terminalia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' II 679.&lt;/ref&gt; On that day, Roman pontiffs and magistrates held a ceremony at the sixth mile of the [[Via Laurentina]] (ancient border of the Roman ''ager'', which maintained a religious value). 
This festival, however, marked the end of the year and was linked to time more directly than to space (as attested by Augustine's [[Apologetics|apologia]] on the role of Janus with respect to endings).&lt;ref&gt;Augustine CD VII 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dario Sabbatucci has emphasised the temporal affiliation of Terminus, a reminder of which is found in the rite of the ''regifugium''.&lt;ref&gt;D. Sabbatucci above.&lt;/ref&gt; 
G. Dumézil, on the other hand, views the function of this god as associated with the legalistic aspect of the sovereign function of Jupiter. Terminus would be the counterpart of the minor Vedic god Bagha, who oversees the just and fair division of goods among citizens.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iuventas===
{{See also|Iuventas}}

Along with ''Terminus'', '' Iuventas'' (also known as  ''Iuventus'' and ''Iuunta'') represents an aspect of Jupiter (as the legend of her refusal to leave the Capitol Hill demonstrates. Her name has the same root as [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] (from ''Iuu-'', "young, youngster"); the ceremonial litter bearing the sacred goose of Juno Moneta stopped before her ''sacellum'' on the festival of the goddess. Later, she was identified with the Greek [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]]. The fact that Jupiter is related to the concept of youth is shown by his epithets ''Puer'', ''Iuuentus'' and ''Ioviste'' (interpreted as "the youngest" by some scholars).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=135}}; G. Dumezil ''La relig. rom. arch.'' Paris 1974; It. tr. Milano 1977 pp. 185–186; C. W. Atkins "Latin 'Iouiste' et le vocabulaire religieux indoeuropéen" in ''Mélanges Benveniste'' Paris, 1975, pp. 527–535.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil noted the presence of the two minor sovereign deities Bagha and [[Aryaman]] beside the Vedic sovereign gods Varuna and Mitra (though more closely associated with Mitra); the couple would be reflected in Rome by ''Terminus'' and ''Iuventas''. Aryaman is the god of young soldiers. The function of ''Iuventas'' is to protect the ''iuvenes'' (the ''novi togati'' of the year, who are required to offer a sacrifice to Jupiter on the Capitol)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=135}}, citing Servius Danielis  ''Eclogae'' IV 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Roman soldiers (a function later attributed to Juno). King Servius Tullius, in reforming the Roman social organisation, required that every adolescent offer a coin to the goddess of youth upon entering adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Piso apud Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Rom. Antiquities'' IV 15, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dumézil's analysis, the function of ''Iuventas'' (the personification of youth), was to control the entrance of young men into society and protect them until they reach the age of ''iuvenes'' or ''iuniores'' (i.e. of serving the state as soldiers).&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt;
A temple to ''Iuventas'' was promised in 207 BC by consul [[Marcus Livius Salinator]] and dedicated in 191 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Livy XXXV 36, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penates===
{{See also|Penates}}
The Romans considered the Penates as the gods to whom they owed their own existence.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 4, 8–9 citing Varro: "Per quos penitus spiramus". Sabine Mac Cormack ''The Shadows of Poetry: Vergil in the Mind of Augustine'' University of California Press 1998 p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Wissowa ''Penates'' is an adjective, meaning "those of or from the ''penus''" the innermost part, most hidden recess;&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 311–312.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil though refuses Wissowa's interpretation of ''penus'' as the storeroom of a household. As a nation the Romans honoured the ''Penates publici'': Dionysius calls them ''Trojan gods'' as they were absorbed into the Trojan legend. They had a temple in Rome at the foot of the [[Velian Hill]], near the Palatine, in which they were represented as a couple of male youth. They were honoured every year by the new consuls before entering office at [[Lavinium]],&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''De Lingua Latina'' V 144; Plutarch ''Coriolanus'' XXIX 2; Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 4, 11; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' II 296: as cited by Dumézil ARR above p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; because the Romans believed the Penates of that town were identical to their own.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''di Penates'' is more defined in Etruria: [[Arnobius]] (citing a Caesius) states that the Etruscan Penates were named Fortuna, Ceres, Genius Iovialis and Pales; according to [[Nigidius Figulus]], they included those of Jupiter, of Neptune, of the infernal gods and of mortal men.&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius ''Adversus nationes'' III 40. Cf. also Lucan ''Pharsalia'' V 696; VII 705; VIII 21.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Varro the Penates reside in the recesses of Heaven and are called ''Consentes'' and ''Complices'' by the Etruscans because they rise and set together, are twelve in number and their names are unknown, six male and six females and are the cousellors and masters of Jupiter. Martianus states they are always in agreement among themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' III 40, 3; Martianus Capella ''De Nuptiis'' I 41: "Senatores deorum qui Penates ferebantur Tonantis ipsius quorumque nomina, quoniam publicari secretum caeleste non pertulit, ex eo quod omnia pariter repromittunt, nomen eis consensione perficit".&lt;/ref&gt; While these last gods seem to be the Penates of Jupiter, Jupiter himself along with Juno and Minerva is one of the Penates of man according to some authors.&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' III 40 4;  Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 4 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

This complex concept is reflected in Martianus Capella's division of heaven, found in Book I of his ''De Nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae'', which places the ''Di Consentes Penates'' in region I with the ''Favores Opertanei''; ''Ceres'' and ''Genius'' in region V; ''Pales'' in region VI; ''Favor'' and ''Genius'' (again) in region VII; ''Secundanus Pales'', ''Fortuna'' and ''Favor Pastor'' in region XI. The disposition of these divine entities and their repetition in different locations may be due to the fact that ''Penates'' belonging to different categories (of Jupiter in region I, earthly or of mortal men in region V) are intended. ''Favor(es)'' may be the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] masculine equivalent of ''Fortuna''.&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Capdeville "Les dieux de Martianus Capella" in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''213''' 1996 3 p. 285 citing Carl Olof Thulin ''Die Götter des Martianus Capella und der Bronzeleber von Piacenza'' (=RGVV 3. 1) Giessen 1906 pp. 38–39. On the topic see also A. L. Luschi  "Cacu, Fauno e i venti'  in ''Studi Etruschi''  '''57''' 1991 pp. 105–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jürg Federspiel''' (28 June 1931  &amp;ndash; 12 January 2007) was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] writer, born  in Kemptthal, [[Canton Zurich]]. Federspiel authored more than 20 [[novel]]s and [[short story]] collections.&lt;ref name="NY Times -- 28Feb2007 -- Jürg Federspiel, Who Wrote ‘Typhoid Mary,’ Dies at 75 "&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/28/obituaries/28federspiel.html?fta=y|title=Jürg Federspiel, Who Wrote ‘Typhoid Mary,’ Dies at 75 |date=28 February 2007|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federspiel grew up in [[Davos]] and attended secondary school in [[Basel]]. From 1951 he worked as a [[journalist]] and [[film critic]] for several Swiss newspapers, and spent time in Germany, France, Great Britain, Ireland and the USA.

His first notable work was a collection of short stories, ''Orangen und Tode'' ("Oranges and death") in 1961.&lt;ref name="NZZ"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nzz.ch/2007/02/25/fe/newzzEYLS9SYW-12.html

Towards the end of his life, he lived alternately in Basel and [[New York City]]. His last published book was ''Mond ohne Zeiger'' ("Moon without hands"), a collection of poetry in 2001. He suffered for years with severe [[diabetes]] and [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name="NY Times -- 28Feb2007 -- Jürg Federspiel, Who Wrote ‘Typhoid Mary,’ Dies at 75 "/&gt;
 
Federspiel died on 25 February 2007 in Basel, having been missing since 12 January 2007. The cause of death was assumed to be suicide.&lt;ref name="NZZ"/&gt;

'''Kenneth Stewart Cole''' (July 10, 1900 – April 18, 1984) was an American [[biophysicist]] described by his peers as "a pioneer in the application of physical science to biology".&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, D.E. 1985. Kenneth S. Cole 1900-1984. ''Biophysical Journal'' 47:859-860&lt;/ref&gt; Cole was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Kenneth Cole, 83, Scientist, is Dead |quote= Kenneth S. Cole, winner of the National Medal of Science and a pioneer in the study of the electrical properties of nerves and other living cells, died Wednesday at the Wesley Palms Retirement Home in [[La Jolla, California]] He was 83 years old. Dr. Cole, known as the ''father of biophysics,'' was one of the first scientists to apply the concepts and techniques of physics to the study of the excitation and response of living cells. His studies of electrical resistance in nerve cells, especially those of squid, laid the foundation for the rapid advance of neurophysiology in the 1930s and 1940s.  |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=April 20, 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwan HP. 2001.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born on July 10, 1900 in [[Ithaca, New York]] to Charles Nelson Cole, an instructor in Latin at [[Cornell University]] and Mabel Stewart. Kenneth had a younger brother, {{ill|Robert H. Cole|wd=Q56567758}}, with whom he remained very close throughout his life despite a large difference in age; they were joint authors of four papers published between 1936 and 1942.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

In 1902 the family moved to [[Oberlin, Ohio]], when his father took a post at [[Oberlin College]]. His father would later become the Dean. Kenneth's mother was, and Cole graduated from [[Oberlin College]] in 1922 and received a [[Ph.D.]] in physics with [[Floyd K. Richtmyer]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1926. He spent summers working at the [[General Electric]] laboratory in [[Schenectady, New York]].

In 1932, Cole married Elizabeth Evans Roberts, an attorney. Later, her work was mostly concerned with civil rights and in 1957 she joined the staff of the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]]&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew  |last=Huxley |url=http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/kcole.html |title=Kenneth Stewart Cole |accessdate=2007-06-14 |authorlink=Andrew Huxley |website= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth joined the staff of [[Columbia University]] in 1937 and remained there until 1946. He had also been associated with the [[Presbyterian Hospital (New York City)|Presbyterian Hospital]], and the [[Guggenheim Foundation for Advanced Study]] at [[Princeton University]] and the [[University of Chicago]].

From 1949 to 1954 he was the technical director of the [[Naval Medicine Research Institute]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. In 1954 he became chief of the laboratory of biophysics of the [[National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness]].

He achieved advances that led to the "sodium theory" of nerve transmission that later won [[Nobel Prizes]] for [[Alan L. Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew F. Huxley]] in 1963. Cole was elected a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1956,&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenneth S. Cole|url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/deceased-members/56820.html|website=[[National Academy of Sciences]]|accessdate=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter C|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterC.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1967, the award citation, read: "As a result, we know far more about how the nervous system functions." In 1972 he was made a member of the [[Royal Society of London]]. The [[Biophysical Society]] awards the Kenneth S. Cole medal to a scientist studying cell membranes.

In 1980 he became an adjunct professor of the Department of Neurosciences at the [[Scripps Institute of Oceanography]] in [[San Diego]]. He had a son, Roger Braley Cole, and a daughter, Sarah Roberts Cole.

He died on April 18, 1984 in [[La Jolla, California]].&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;

==Electrical Model of Tissue==

Tissue can be modeled as an electrical circuit with resistive and capacitive properties:

[[Image:Cole cole circuit.jpg|thumb|Equivalent Electrical Circuit]]

Its dispersion and absorption are represented by the empirical formula:

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon^* - \epsilon_\infty  = \dfrac{\epsilon_0 - \epsilon_\infty}{1 + (i\omega\tau_0)^{1-\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation &lt;math&gt;\epsilon^*&lt;/math&gt; is the complex dielectric constant, &lt;math&gt; {\epsilon_0 }&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_\infty&lt;/math&gt; are the "static" and "infinite frequency" dielectric constants, &lt;math&gt;\omega = 2\pi&lt;/math&gt; times the frequency, and &lt;math&gt;\tau_0&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized relaxation time. The parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can assume values between 0 and 1, the former value giving the result of Debye for polar dielectrics. This expression requires that the locus of the dielectric constant in the complex plane be a circular arc with end points on the axis of reals and center below the axis.

It is worth emphasizing that the Cole–Cole model is an empirical model of the measured data. It has been successfully applied to a wide variety of tissues over the past 60 years, but it does not give any information about the underlying causes of the phenomena being measured.

Several references in the literature use a form of the Cole equation written in terms of impedance instead of a complex permittivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=B H|last2=Smallwood|first2=R H|last3=Barber|first3=D C|last4=Lawford|first4=P V|last5=Hose|first5=D R|title=Medical Physics And Biomedical Engineering|year=1999|publisher=Turtleback Books|isbn=9780613919692|pages=736|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7mVLPgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

&lt;math&gt;
Z = R_\infty + \frac{R_0-R_\infty}{1+(\tfrac{jf}{f_c})^{1-\alpha}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_\infty&lt;/math&gt; are the resistances at zero frequency (i.e. DC) and infinity, respectively. &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt; is often referred to as the characteristic frequency. It should be emphasized that the characteristic frequency is not the same when the analysis is carried out in terms of the complex permittivity.
A simple interpretation of the above equation is in terms of a circuit where a resistance &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is in series with a capacitor &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and this combination is placed in parallel with a resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. In this case &lt;math&gt;R_0 = R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_\infty\ = \tfrac{RS}{R+S}&lt;/math&gt;. It can be shown that &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;f_c=\tfrac{1}{2\pi C(R+S)}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Big Brother 5 (UK)|fifth edition]] of the British reality series ''Big Brother'' featured a total of thirteen housemates competing to win the series. Twelve housemates entered on the first night, with the final housemate entering later on as an intruder.

==Ahmed==
Ahmed Aghil was a 44-year-old property developer and advocate. He has graduated with a law degree from the [[North London University]].

'''[[French American]]s''' are [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizens]] or [[nationality|nationals]] of [[French people|French descent]] and heritage. The majority of Franco-American families did not arrive directly from France, but rather settled [[New France|French territories in the New World]] (primarily in the 17th and 18th centuries) before moving or being forced to move to the United States later on (see [[Quebec diaspora]] and [[Great Upheaval]]). Also, the largest French territory in North America was sold to the U.S., absorbing their French citizens (see [[Louisiana Purchase]]). About thirteen million U.S. residents are of French descent, and about 1.5 million of them speak the French language at home. Being isolated, mixed with different cultures, or ignored, the French-Americans developed particular cultures that reflect varying degrees of adaptation of their environments. This gave birth to streams of French-Americans like the Acadians, the Cajuns (an Anglicization of the autonym ''Cadien'', from the French word for Acadian, ''Acadien''), Louisiana Créoles and many others.

The following is a list of '''notable French Americans''' by occupation, including both original immigrants who obtained American citizenship and their American descendants.

'''Maria and Teresa Tapia''' (born April 8, 2010) are formerly [[conjoined twins]] born in the [[Dominican Republic]]. The twins were joined by their lower chest and abdomen and were therefore classified as omphalopagus sharing a liver, pancreas, and a small portion of their small intestine. On November 7, 2011, the twins underwent a successful separation surgery at the Children's Hospital of Richmond in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;(Burkett)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conjoined Twins ==
For every 200,000 live births, conjoined twins are born. Conjoined twins are identical and of the same sex one hundred percent of the time and are more common in females than in males. For surgical separations the survival rate of at least one twin surviving is approximately 75%.&lt;ref&gt;(CNN, Library)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Separation surgery was critical to this set of twins as 88 percent of the blood flow from the liver was transmitted to Teresa leaving Maria approximately 20 percent smaller due to a lack of nutrients.  The Dominican Republic does not have access to the medical tools needed to separate the twins. Upon learning about the twins, World Pediatric Project stepped in and helped.

=== World Pediatric Project ===
The World Pediatric Project is a non-profit organization that heals critically ill children in developing nations that may not have access to quality health care tools or procedures. WPP was founded in 2001 as the International Hospital for Children with a  mission "to link worldwide pediatric surgical, diagnostic and preventative resources to heal critically ill children in developing countries."  The International Hospital for Children and a non-profit organization based in St. Louis merged in March 2011 and became World Pediatric Project.&lt;ref&gt;(World Pediatric Project)&lt;/ref&gt; WPP heard about the twins' story through their partners in the Dominican Republic and as a result brought the twins and their mother to the United States to receive surgery performed by Dr. David Lanning.

=== Children’s Hospital of Richmond ===

== Surgery Team==

The surgery team included a variety of doctors and surgeons to ensure the twins' safety during and after the procedure. There were a variety of departments from plastics to anesthesiology represented.  The surgeon team that completed the 20-hour surgery was composed of the following:

=== The Separation Team ===
*Jennifer Rhodes, professor of the Department of Surgery Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at VCU, and director of the Children’s Hospital of Richmond Center for Craniofacial Care
*Robert Fisher, M.D., professor of surgery and director of liver transplant program 
*Claudio Oiticica, M.D. associate professor of surgery.

Dr Lanning also worked alongside the Division of Pediatric [[Anesthesiology]]. The Division of Pediatric Anesthesiology played a significant role in the process that leading up to as well as the actual separation surgery.&lt;ref&gt;(Burkett)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Anesthesia Team===

*Jay Shapiro, M.D., professor
*Jeanette Kierce, M.D., assistant professor
*Arkadiy Dubovoy, M.D., assistant professor
*James Dore, M.D., assistant professor
* Iolanda Russo-Menna, M.D., assistant professor, pediatric anesthesiology

=== Surgery ===
With a team of 45 surgeons, the separation surgery took approximately 20-hours.  The separation process started on November 7, 2011 at 6 am. This was the first time that a surgery of the type was performed at the Children’s Hospital of Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;(Burkett)&lt;/ref&gt; The surgical team divided the pancreas, the liver, as well the organ systems that the twin girls shared. Lastly, the surgical team rebuilt the abdominal walls of the twins.&lt;ref&gt;(Press Associated)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recovery ===

The girls underwent a six-week period for physical therapy and recovery.&lt;ref&gt;(World Pediatric Project)&lt;/ref&gt; Maria and Teresa are now able to walk independently and are starting to form their own individual personalities. The girls were able to return to the Dominican Republic and often return to the United States for follow-up care.

==== Dr. David Lanning, M.D., Ph.D. ====

Background at VCU 
Dr. David Lanning acquired both his M.D. and Ph.D. at Virginia Commonwealth University. In 2002 he finished his general surgical training. His pediatric fellowship was completed at the Children’s Hospital of Michigan. In 2004 he turned to VCU to work. Now Dr. David Lanning practices as an associate professor of Surgery and Pediatrics in Surgery. Now, Dr. Lanning practices both General and Thoracic Pediatric Surgery.&lt;ref&gt;(Virginia Health System)&lt;/ref&gt;

Background with the World Pediatric Project
* Since 2007 Dr. Lanning has volunteered with World Pediatric Project.  
* The first mission trip that Dr. Lanning attended with World Pediatric Project was in the countries of [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] and Grenadines. Every year Dr. Lanning visits these countries and performs surgeries to heal children that are in St. Vincent as well as the nearby by area.

[[General (United Kingdom)|General]] '''Sir Miles Christopher Dempsey''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GBE|KCB|DSO|MC}} (15 December 1896 – 6 June 1969) was a senior [[British Army]] officer who served in both [[world war]]s. As a junior officer, he fought in France during the [[First World War]], where he was wounded, and served throughout the difficult [[interwar period]], travelling to various corners of the globe.

During the [[Second World War]] he had a close relationship with [[Bernard Montgomery]] and commanded the [[13th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|13th Brigade]] in [[Battle of France|France]] in 1940, and spent the next two years training troops in England, before commanding [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] for the invasions of [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]] in 1943. He later commanded the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] during the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]] and made rapid advances in the subsequent campaign in Northern France and Belgium and was the first British Army commander to cross the Rhine. A highly professional and dedicated career soldier who made his reputation in active service, Miles Dempsey was highly thought of by both his superiors and subordinates, most notably Montgomery, although he remains relatively unknown.

==Early life and military career==
Miles Christopher Dempsey was born in [[Wallasey]], Cheshire on 15 December 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWdempseyA.htm|title=Miles Dempsey biography at Spartacus Educational|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231085429/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWdempseyA.htm|archivedate=31 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the descendant of a powerful clan in Offaly and Laois in Ireland with a very long history. His ancestor [[Terence O'Dempsey, 1st Viscount Clanmalier|Terence O'Dempsey, Viscount Clanmalier]], was loyal to the Catholic King James II and, as a result, lost all his lands in 1691. Dempsey's branch of the family then left Ireland for Cheshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selectsurnames2.com/dempsey.html|title=the select surnames website|website=www.selectsurnames2.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and youngest son of Arthur Francis and Margaret Maud Dempsey,&lt;ref name="Officers of the British Army" /&gt; Miles Dempsey was educated at [[Shrewsbury School]], entering there in 1911, where he captained the first eleven [[Cricket]] team in 1914. On leaving Shrewsbury he attended the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]] during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, pps. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smart81"&gt;Smart, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First World War]] Dempsey, aged just 17, volunteered for the [[British Army]] and, after graduating from the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]] in February 1915, six months after the outbreak of war, was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Royal Berkshire Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=29292| date=10 September 1915|page=9066| supp=y|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] in August 1915,&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=29489| date=25 February 1916|page=2101|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; he served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] with the 1st Battalion, Royal Berkshires, from June 1916 onwards. The battalion was a [[Standing army|Regular Army]] unit that, as part of the [[6th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|6th Brigade]] of the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Division]] (although by the time of Dempsey's arrival the battalion had been transferred to the [[99th Brigade (United Kingdom)|99th Brigade]] of the same division), had been one of the first units of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) to be sent overseas and was stationed in billets away from the [[Trench warfare|trenches]] in the [[Béthune]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Dempsey, serving as a [[Platoon|platoon commander]] in 'D' Company, first saw action during the [[Battle of Delville Wood]] in late July 1916, part of the larger [[Battle of the Somme|Somme offensive]]. The battalion, although successful in its role, had suffered heavy casualties, including 8 officers, and was relieved in the line and saw little further fighting throughout the year. Dempsey was promoted to [[Acting (rank)|acting]] [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] and assumed command of 'D' Company, and later 'B' Company. In November the battalion took part in an assault on Munich Trench, near the [[Serre (river)|River Serre]]. As at Delville Wood earlier in the year, the assault was successful but with heavy losses, although Dempsey again remained unscathed, and soon returned to England for home leave. In February 1917 he became the [[adjutant]] of the battalion.&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Following attacks near [[Miraumont]] and then [[Oppy, Pas-de-Calais|Oppy]], during which Lance Corporal [[James Welch (VC)|James Welch]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC), the battalion, badly understrength, thereafter remained in a quiet sector of the front for most of the year, and was temporarily merged with the 23rd (Service) Battalion, [[Royal Fusiliers]]. Dempsey was soon posted as a [[Staff (military)|staff officer]] at [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II Corps]] HQ, before returning to the 1st Royal Berkshires, this time in command of 'A' Company. In late November the battalion attacked Bourlon Wood as part of the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]].&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March 1918, as the [[German Army (German Empire)|Germans]] prepared to launch their [[Spring Offensive]], they laid down a heavy [[Chemical weapons in World War I|mustard gas]] [[Barrage (artillery)|barrage]] on Dempsey's battalion, which was now at La Vacquerie with Dempsey commanding 'D' Company. Dempsey, along with 10 officers and 250 [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]], was wounded and later evacuated to England, where he had a lung removed.&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the battalion in July, where, with the tide of the war having turned, the 1st Royal Berkshires took part in the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] until the war ended on [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|11 November 1918]]. By then the battalion was at [[Escarmain]].&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; Dempsey was awarded the [[Military Cross]] (MC), which was gazetted in the King's Birthday Honours list in June 1919.&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=31371| supp=y| date=30 May 1919|page=6826|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smart81"/&gt;

==Between the wars==
After the war, in 1919, Dempsey played two [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[cricket]] matches for [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] against [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]] and [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/29/29036/First-Class_Matches.html|title=First-Class Matches played by Miles Dempsey|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1926 and 1932, he also played [[Minor Counties Championship]] cricket for [[Berkshire County Cricket Club|Berkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/29/29036/Minor_Counties_Championship_Matches.html|title=Minor Counties Championship Matches played by Miles Dempsey|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dempsey returned to England with the 1st Royal Berkshires after it served in the [[Allied occupation of the Rhineland]], and later, with the battalion, was sent to [[Iraq]] in 1919, and later [[Persia]], the following year, where the battalion formed part of [[North Persia Force]] (or Norperforce).&lt;ref&gt;English, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, pps. 15-23&lt;/ref&gt; While his battalion was stationed in Persia, Dempsey took up [[Pelmanism (system)|Pelmanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1921 the battalion moved again, this time to [[Bareilly]], [[British Raj|India]], and Dempsey took over 'C' Company, but in 1922 returned to England for his first leave in almost three years, returning to India later in the year before returning to England again in 1923, this time to take up an appointment at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. While there he commanded No. 1 Platoon of No. 1 Company, commanded by [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] [[Richard O'Connor]], who had served with distinction during the First World War, and later to serve with Dempsey again, under very different circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, pps. 25-28&lt;/ref&gt; Dempsey remained in this post, during which, in 1926, he was able to travel around Europe, until 1927, when he returned to regimental duties, returning to his regiment, although he was posted to the 2nd Battalion, then serving in Germany as part of the [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR). Dempsey took over 'B' Company, and spent a large amount of his time travelling, mainly by bicycle, around Europe, visiting old battlefields of old wars, as well as likely scenes of battle in any future conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, pps. 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1930 Dempsey was admitted to the [[Staff College, Camberley]], graduating in December 1931.&lt;ref name="Officers of the British Army" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smart82"&gt;Smart, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; His fellow students in the Junior Division included numerous future [[general officer]]s, including [[William Gott]], [[George F. Hopkinson|George Hopkinson]], [[James Steele (British Army officer)|James Steele]], [[George William Symes|George Symes]], [[Maurice Chilton]], [[Aubertin Walter Sothern Mallaby|Walter Mallaby]], [[Arthur Snelling (British Army officer)|Arthur Snelling]], [[Stuart Blundell Rawlins|Stuart Rawlins]], [[John Nichols (British Army officer)|John Nichols]] and [[Manley Angell James|Manley James]].&lt;ref name="Smart82"/&gt; In the year senior to Dempsey, in the Senior Division attending from 1929–1930, included [[Neil Ritchie]], [[Herbert Lumsden]], [[George Erskine]], [[Ivor Hughes]], [[Reginald Denning]], [[Harold Redman]] and [[I. S. O. Playfair|Ian Playfair]], while in Dempsey's second year, the Junior Division, attending from 1931–1932, included [[Brian Horrocks]], [[Sidney Kirkman]], [[Frank Simpson (British Army officer)|Frank Simpson]], [[Joseph Baillon]], [[Arthur Dowler]], [[Thomas Wynford Rees|Thomas Rees]], [[Keith Arbuthnott, 15th Viscount of Arbuthnott|Keith Arbuthnott]] and [[Cameron Nicholson]]. The instructors in Dempsey's first year included [[Henry Maitland Wilson]], [[George Giffard]], [[Henry Willcox]], [[John George Walters Clark|John Clark]] and [[James Gammell]], and [[Arthur Percival]] and [[Sir John Smyth, 1st Baronet|John Smyth]].&lt;ref&gt;Rostron, pps. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all of these men were to achieve high rank in the upcoming war.&lt;ref name="Smart81"/&gt;

Enjoying his time at the Staff College, Dempsey's first posting after Camberley was as a [[Staff (military)|General Staff Officer Grade 3]] (GSO3) to the [[Military Secretary (United Kingdom)|Military Secretary]], where he became responsible for the careers of all officers below the rank of [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]], having access to their annual confidential reports. Dempsey, by now a major (having been promoted in September 1932),&lt;ref name="Officers of the British Army" /&gt; held this post until late January 1934, when he handed over to Brian Horrocks upon receiving an appointment as [[brigade major]] of the [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Infantry Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, pps. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; The brigade, commanded by [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Victor Fortune]] ([[Francis Nosworthy]] from 1935), formed part of the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Division]], then commanded by [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major General]] [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], was serving in [[Aldershot Command]] and took part in numerous large-scale [[Military exercise|military maneouvres]] throughout Dempsey's time as brigade major and, after handing over again to Brian Horrocks in February 1936, he returned to the 1st Battalion of his regiment, taking command of HQ Company.&lt;ref&gt;Smart 2010, pps. 36-38&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion, then stationed in [[Shorncliffe, Kent]], was serving as part of the [[10th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|10th Brigade]] of the [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Division]], and shortly after Dempsey's return, the battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel [[Eric Miles (British Army officer)|Eric Miles]].&lt;ref&gt;Rostron, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Dempsey attended a brief course at the [[Senior Officers' School]] at [[Sheerness]], before being posted to South Africa, where he served as a GSO2 with the [[Union Defence Force (South Africa)|Defence Forces of the Union of South Africa]], a posting which he enjoyed.&lt;ref name="Officers of the British Army" /&gt; Relinquishing that post in late January 1938, he returned to England soon after to succeed Miles as [[Commanding Officer]] (CO) of the 1st Battalion, Royal Berkshires, and receiving a promotion to lieutenant colonel.&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion, still with the 10th Brigade, was both lacking in modern equipment and severely understrength, although, with the possibility of another war in Europe, the situation slowly changed and new equipment and reservists began arriving.&lt;ref&gt;Rostron, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
===Belgium and France, 1939–1940===
[[File:British Generals 1939-1945 F3108.jpg|thumb|left|Brigadier Miles Dempsey and his staff, with their mascot 'Tiny' at Wervicq, France, pictured here in late 1939.]]

By the start of the [[Second World War]] in September 1939 Dempsey's battalion had moved, transferring from Brigadier [[Evelyn Barker]]'s 10th Brigade to Brigadier [[Noel Irwin]]'s [[6th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|6th Brigade]], part of the 2nd Division, commanded by Major General [[Charles Loyd]].&lt;ref name="Smart81"/&gt; Dempsey, with his battalion, was sent to France towards the end of the month, as part of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF). In November he was promoted to the [[Acting (rank)|acting rank]] of brigadier&lt;ref name="Officers of the British Army" /&gt; and assumed command of the [[13th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|13th Infantry Brigade]] in place of Brigadier Henry Willcox, who had been one of Dempsey's instructors at the Staff College in the 1930s, which was already in France.&lt;ref name="Smart81"/&gt; Aged just 42, he was one of the youngest brigadiers in the British Army. The brigade formed part of Major General [[Harold Franklyn]]'s [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]], although by war's beginning the division was still not fully formed and so the brigade was sent to France as an independent formation two months before, and had spent most of its time on guard duties in the BEF's rear areas.&lt;ref name="Mead117"&gt;Mead 2007, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The brigade, together with the [[15th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|15th Infantry Brigade]], under Brigadier [[Horatio Pettus Mackintosh Berney-Ficklin|Horatio Berney-Ficklin]], and the [[17th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|17th Infantry Brigade]], under Brigadier [[Montagu Stopford]], rejoined the 5th Division when the division HQ arrived in late December.&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, pps. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1940 the brigade saw action on the retreat from the River Dyle and then fought in the major defensive battle on the River Scarpe. When the Belgian Army surrendered in late May the brigade took part in the holding battle on the Ypres-Comines canal allowing Major General [[Bernard Montgomery]]'s [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Infantry Division]] to cross their rear and secure the gap created by the Belgian collapse.&lt;ref name="Mead117"/&gt; In the subsequent [[Battle of Dunkirk|retreat to Dunkirk]] the brigade provided part of the rear-guard for the BEF during the [[Dunkirk evacuation]]. By the time the 13th Brigade returned to England it was reduced to a strength of less than 500 men, out of an original strength of nearly 3,000. For his services in France, Dempsey was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in July 1940,&lt;ref name="DSO"&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34893| supp=y| date=9 July 1940|page=4261|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was presented to him personally by the GOC, Major General Franklyn, who was soon replaced by Major General Berney-Ficklin.&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smart82"/&gt;

===England, 1940–1942===
In July 1940 Dempsey took up the appointment of Brigadier General Staff (BGS) to the [[Canadian Corps (World War II)|Canadian Corps]]&lt;ref name="Mead117"/&gt; until June 1941 when he was appointed acting rank of major general to command of the [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th Infantry Division]] and then [[42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division]] four months later, which was converting to an armoured division.&lt;ref name="Mead117"/&gt; requiring him to implement a huge training programme. Further challenges were presented in May 1942 when the establishment of British armoured divisions was altered to team an armoured brigade with an infantry brigade rather than two armoured brigades. By the end of the year Dempsey had become well-versed in the direction of combined armoured and infantry formations as well as an experienced trainer of troops.&lt;ref name="Mead118"&gt;Mead 2007, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Campaign in Sicily 1943 NA5687.jpg|thumb|right|Lieutenant General Dempsey with two of his staff (Major Priestly and Captain Hay) in Sicily, July 1943.]]

===North Africa, Sicily and Italy, 1942–1943===
In December 1942 Dempsey was promoted to [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|lieutenant general]] to command [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] in North Africa. Montgomery, the Eighth Army commander, had first spotted Dempsey's potential when he had been one of his students at the Staff College.&lt;ref name="Mead118"/&gt; On arrival in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], Dempsey found his corps HQ in reserve because the long [[Line of communication|lines of communication]] to Eighth Army's spearhead could only sustain two corps ([[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] and [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]]). Dempsey was therefore employed in the planning of the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invasion of Sicily]] and led his corps in the assault on Sicily in July 1943.

The invasion was spearheaded by [[airborne forces]] under Dempsey's command (see operations [[Operation Ladbroke|Ladbroke]] and [[Operation Fustian|Fustian]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, pps. 62-65&lt;/ref&gt; In early August Dempsey relieved Major General [[Horatio Pettus Mackintosh Berney-Ficklin|Horatio Berney-Ficklin]], commander of the [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Infantry Division]], then under XIII Corps.&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the campaign, Dempsey's HQ was withdrawn to reserve to plan [[Operation Baytown]], Eighth Army's part in the [[Allied invasion of Italy|invasion of Italy]] across the [[Strait of Messina]].&lt;ref name="Mead119"&gt;Mead 2007, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Although his Corps' landing on 3 September was unopposed, the Germans ensured his progress was slow by destroying bridges and culverts on the only routes through the harsh terrain. It took nearly two weeks to advance more than {{convert|300|mi|km}} to the north to link up with the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]] (which contained, in addition to the [[VI Corps (United States)|U.S. VI Corps]], the British X Corps) landing at Salerno as part of [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Operation Avalanche]]. Allied forces then commenced to fight their way northward with Fifth Army to the west and Eighth Army to the east of Italy's [[Apennine Mountains|Apennine Mountain]] spine.&lt;ref name="Mead119"/&gt; The corps later took part in the [[Moro River Campaign]] but the severe winter weather forbade any further progress.

===Northwestern Europe, 1944–1945===
In North Africa, Sicily and Italy, Montgomery's faith in Dempsey had proved justified and he had also gained a reputation for his expertise in [[Combined Operations]]. This prompted Montgomery, when he left Italy at the end of 1943 to take command of the [[21st Army Group]] for the forthcoming [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]], to select Dempsey to command the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|British Second Army]]. The Second Army was the main British force (although it also included [[Canadian Army]] units) involved in the landings, making successful assaults at [[Gold Beach|Gold]], [[Juno Beach|Juno]] and [[Sword Beach|Sword]] beaches on 6 June 1944.

[[File:Bradley - Montgomery - Dempsey.jpg|thumb|right|Lieutenant General Sir M.C. Dempsey (right) with the [[21st Army Group]] commander, [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]] (centre), and [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]] commander, [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Omar Bradley]] (left), 10 June 1944.]]

The successful assaults were followed by a [[Attrition warfare|battle of attrition]] during which the Anglo-Canadian forces were frustrated by determined German resistance. This fighting drew vital German units including the bulk of their armoured strength to the [[Caen]] sector, facilitating the breakout further west in July (see [[Operation Cobra]]) by [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George S. Patton]]'s [[United States Army Central|U.S. Third Army]].&lt;ref name="Mead120"&gt;Mead 2007, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Army then made a rapid advance across northern France into [[Belgium]], liberating [[Brussels]] and [[Antwerp]] in September 1944. On 15 October 1944, during a visit to the Second Army, [[George VI|King George VI]] [[knight]]ed Dempsey on the battlefield. Because of the fast and successful advance over more than 200 miles in a week Dempsey received the nickname of "Two Hundred Miles" Dempsey.

Second Army's XXX Corps (now commanded by Lieutenant General [[Brian Horrocks]]) took part in [[Operation Market Garden]], the failed attempt to secure an early crossing of the River Rhine in September 1944, which Dempsey believed could not succeed and openly questioned to Montgomery. Airborne troops secured a succession of canal and river crossings to enable XXX Corps to reach the Lower Rhine at [[Arnhem]] and wheel right into Germany. Intelligence had not detected the presence of unexpected German formations in the area and resistance proved greater than expected frustrating XXX Corps attempts to reach its final objective. During the operation, Dempsey, forward near the front with his Tac HQ, witnessed the crossing of the [[82nd Airborne Division|U.S. 82nd Airborne Division]]'s [[504th Infantry Regiment (United States)|504th Parachute Regiment]] cross the [[Nijmegen]] bridge. Impressed, he later wrote that the 82nd was "easily the best division on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western front]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Dempsey met with the 82nd's commander, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[James M. Gavin]], shook him by the hand and said "I am proud to meet the commander of the greatest division in the world today."&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:General Dempsey crossing the Rhine.jpg|thumb|left|Lieutenant General Dempsey crossing the [[Rhine]] in a small boat, March 1945.]]

The Second Army, with XII and XXX Corps in the vanguard and [[II Canadian Corps]] under command and [[VIII Corps (United Kingdom)|VIII Corps]] in reserve eventually [[Operation Plunder|crossed the Rhine]] on 23 March 1945,&lt;ref name="Mead120+121"&gt;Mead 2007, pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt; and Dempsey was the first British Army commander to do so. On 7 April 1945, ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' carried a full front page of a specially commissioned portrait painting of Dempsey by artist [[Arthur Pan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iln.org.uk/iln_years/year/1945.htm "The Illustrated London News 1945"], iln.org.uk. Retrieved 19 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
In May, Dempsey's men captured [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], Hamburg and [[Kiel]]. At 11.00&amp;nbsp;am on 3 May, a delegation of senior German officers led by General Admiral [[Hans-Georg von Friedeburg|von Friedeberg]] arrived at Dempsey's Tac HQ and after questioning it appeared that Friedeberg was a representative of ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Wilhelm Keitel|Keitel]] and Grand Admiral [[Karl Dönitz|Dönitz]] who wished to surrender. In typical fashion Dempsey sent them on their way to report to Montgomery which led to the [[German surrender at Lüneburg Heath|formal surrender]] the next day at Lüneberg Heath.

===Far East, 1945–1946===
After the [[end of World War II in Europe]], Dempsey was appointed to the command of the [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|British Fourteenth Army]] and GOC in C [[Malaya Command]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Army%20Commands%201900-2011.pdf |title=Army Commands |publisher= |accessdate=3 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705211343/http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Army%20Commands%201900-2011.pdf |archivedate=5 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then Land Force Commander, South East Asia. By the time he had arrived however, the war in the East was also over.&lt;ref name="Mead121"&gt;Mead 2007, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Within his command were 123,000 British and Dutch prisoners and nearly 750,000 captured Japanese.

Miles Dempsey, although modest and unassuming, was considered to be a highly competent officer. He asserted a very effective control over the  [[British Second Army|Second Army (United Kingdom)]] without taking the limelight. This was despite the stalemate in Normandy and the failure to advance beyond Antwerp and thus ensure that German forces remained isolated. He was claimed by military historian [[Carlo D'Este]] to be:
{{quote|A career infantryman, Dempsey was an ardent student of military history and during the interwar period had frequently visited Europe to study its battlefields firsthand. Blessed with an active and incisive mind, a phenomenal memory and a unique skill in reading maps, Dempsey would soon leave his army staff in awe over his ability to remember everything he saw on a map, to bring a landscape literally to life in his mind even though he had never actually seen it. This talent proved particularly important during the crucial [[Battle for Caen|battles around Caen]] in June and July 1944. Dempsey was considered the Eighth Army's best expert in [[combined operations]] and, as he grew in experience, Montgomery soon recognized his potential for army command. The two men shared many qualities, including a disdain for paperwork and a determination, based on their First World War experiences, never to waste their soldiers lives.&lt;ref&gt;D'Este 2004, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Post-war==
In 1946 he was appointed [[Commander-in-Chief]] (C-in-C) of [[Middle East Command|Middle East Land Forces]], and was in command throughout the [[Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine|Palestine Emergency]]. He was made acting general in June 1946&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=37648| supp=y| date=9 July 1946|page=3607|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was made permanent in October 1946&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=37764| supp=y| date=18 October 1946|page=5191|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed to the ceremonial post of Aide de Camp general to the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=37781| supp=y| date=5 November 1946|page=5461|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dempsey retired from the British Army in August 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38051|date=19 August 1947|page=3933|supp=y|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, he was given a 'shadow' appointment as Commander In Chief, British Home forces which he relinquished in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=40698| supp=y| date=27 January 1956|page=639|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held the ceremonial posts of [[Colonel Commandant]] of the [[Royal Military Police]], (1947 to 1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=37990| supp=y| date=17 June 1947|page=2772|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=41034| supp=y| date=26 March 1957|page=6169|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Special Air Service]] (1951–1960)&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=39176| supp=y| date=16 March 1951|page=1498|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=42004| supp=y| date=8 April 1960|page=2640|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel of the Regiment]] of the [[Royal Berkshire Regiment|Princess Charlotte of Wales Royal Berkshire Regiment]] (1946 to 1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=37823| supp=y| date=17 December 1946|page=6169|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=40928| supp=y| date=16 November 1946|page=6564|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also [[Honorary Colonel]] of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial army's]] 21st SAS Regiment (Artists Rifles) from 1948 to 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=38237 |supp=2 |date=12 March 1948 |page=1866 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=39270| supp=y| date=26 June 1951|page=3538|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, Dempsey married Viola O'Reilly, the youngest daughter of Captain [[Percy O'Reilly]] of [[Coolamber]], [[County Westmeath]], Ireland. The couple lived at "The Old Vicarage", Greenham, [[Newbury, Berkshire]], and later rented "Coombe House", Yattendon, Berkshire. When the former house was requisitioned as part of the U.S. Airforce base, President Eisenhower personally arranged compensation to be paid to his friend and wartime colleague.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

He was Chairman of the Race Course Betting Board, [[Simonds Brewery|H&amp;G Simonds]], [[Greene King|Greene King and Sons]] (the first non-family chairman) and Deputy Chairman of [[Courage Brewery|Courage Ltd]]. He was commissioned as a Deputy Lord Lieutenant in the county of Berkshire in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=39053| date=27 October 1950|page=5362|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dempsey declined to write any memoirs about his military experiences. He ordered that his diaries be burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Master of the Battlefield Monty's War Years 1942–1944|last1=Hamilton|first1=Nigel|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company|year=1983|page=697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
After returning to England from visiting a nephew in [[Kenya]], Dempsey was diagnosed with cancer. He died soon afterwards, on 6 June 1969, at the age of 72, exactly 25 years after [[Normandy landings|D-Day]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=djft3U1LymYC&amp;dat=19690606&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en "D-Day General Dies", ''Pittsburgh Press'', June 6, 1969, p1&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;"Obituary— General Sir Miles Dempsey", ''The Guardian'', June 7, 1969, p3&lt;/ref&gt;  He is buried at [[Yattendon]] churchyard, [[Berkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Rostron 2010, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tributes==
* In September 1944, Sir Miles Dempsey was made an honorary citizen of the city of [[Caen]] in Normandy, France.
* Around 1990, a street in Caen (''avenue Général Dempsey'') was named after him,&lt;ref&gt;Caen map, La Poste, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; in a district close to the [[Mémorial pour la Paix museum]], where many of the streets commemorate personalities linked with the Second World War. The street links the ''avenue Maréchal Montgomery'' to the ''avenue Amiral Mountbatten''.
* In the Dutch town of [[Langenboom]] a street was named after him (''Dempseystraat'').
* In the small Belgian town of [[Hamont-Achel]], General Sir Miles Dempsey and his Second Army held their headquarters here, from September 1944 until April 1945. In honour, the street was named after him ''Generaal Dempseylaan''.
* In Singapore, Dempsey Hill and Dempsey Road are named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dempseyhill.com/history.html|title=Dempsey|website=www.dempseyhill.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nazperver Kadın''' ({{lang-ota|نازپرور قادین}}; 12 June 1870 &amp;ndash; 9 March 1929; born '''Princess Emine Çikotua'''),{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=171}} meaning "Breeder of grace",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Halide Edib|last=Adıvar|title=Inside India|publisher=K.N. Book House|year=2009|pages=143|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the fourth wife of Sultan [[Mehmed V]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=261}}{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=703}}

==Early life==
Nazperver Kadın was born on 12 June 1870 in [[Beşiktaş]], [[Istanbul]]. Born as Emine Çikotua, she was a member of an [[Abkhaz people|Abkhazian]] princely family Çikotua.  Her father waas Prince Ismail Bey Çikotua, and her mother was Princess Aliye Hanım Dziapş-lpa, the daughter of Prince Mahmud Dziapş-lpa. She had a sister named Behiye Hanım. She was the maternal niece of [[Dürrünev Kadın]], first wife of Sultan [[Abdülaziz]].{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=171-2}} 

In 1874, Emine had been brought to [[Istanbul]] as a young child, where her father entrusted her and her sister to the care of her aunt Dürrünev Kadın. her name according to the custom of the Ottoman court was changed to Nazperver.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=172}}

Abdülaziz was deposed by his ministers on 30 May 1876, his nephew [[Murad V]] became the Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Erik J.|last=Zürcher|title=Turkey: A Modern History, Revised Edition|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=October 15, 2004|pages=73|isbn=978-1-850-43399-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was transferred to [[Feriye Palace]] the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Stanford J.|last1=Shaw|first2=Ezel Kural|last2=Shaw|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey: Volume 2, Reform, Revolution, and Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey 1808-1975, Volume 11|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1976|pages=164|isbn=978-0-521-29166-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her aunt Dürrünev, and other women of Abdülaziz's entourage didn't wanted to leave the Dolmabahçe Palace. So they were grabbed by hand and were send out to the Feriye Palace. In the process, they were searched from head to toe and everything of value was taken from them.{{sfn|Brookes|2010|p=40}} Naperver followed her aunt to Feriye Palace.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=172}} On 4 June 1876,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Roderic H.|last=Davison|title=Reform in the Ottoman Empire, 1856-1876|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=December 8, 2015|pages=341|isbn=978-1-400-87876-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdülaziz died under mysterious circumstances.{{sfn|Brookes|2010|p=43}}

==Marriage==
One day, when Mehmed was in his forties, he visited aunt-in-law Dürrünev Kadın in the Feriye Palace. Here he saw Nazperver, then eighteen years old, and fell in love with her. He asked his aunt-in-law to give him Nazperver in marriage. She acceded to her nephew-in-law's demand, and the marriage took place in 1888 in the Veliahd Palace.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=172}} Nazperver didn't bore Mehmed any children.{{sfn|Brookes|2010|p=286}} 

On 27 April 1909, after Mehmed's accession to the throne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Suraiya|last=Faroqhi|title=The Cambridge History of Turkey|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|pages=79|isbn=978-0-521-62096-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was given the title of "Dördüncü Kadın". Upon the death of [[Dürrüaden Kadın]] in October 1909, Nazperver was given the title of "Üçüncü Kadın".{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=261}}{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=703}} 

Safiye Ünüvar, a teacher at the [[Palace School]], who met her in 1915, described her as being plump, and tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Uniwersytet Jagielloński. Instytut Filologii Orientalnej|title=Turks and non-Turks: studies on the history of linguistic and cultural contacts|year=2005|publisher=Institute of Oriental Philology Jagiellonian University|page=524|isbn=978-83-7188-891-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ünüvar, Nazperver did not appeared particularly learned, but she did had a refined and kindly air about her that made a good impression. It seems that having no children weighed heavily upon her, despite the fact that the Sultan treated her most kindly and graciously, and so she lived out her life in this rather downhearted fashion.{{sfn|Brookes|2010|p=210}}

On 18 May 1918, Nazperver met with the Empress [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]] in the Dolmabahçe Palace, when the latter visited Istanbul. During the Empress's visit, she communicated with her in French,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Leyla|last=Açba|title=Bir Çerkes prensesinin harem hatıraları|year=2004|publisher=L &amp; M|pages=56|isbn=978-9-756-49131-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=173}} which she had been taught by her aunt Dürrünev Kadın.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=172}}

'''Paul Hilder''' is a British-born social entrepreneur, writer and organiser. He is co-founder and Chief International Officer of [[Crowdpac]], the platform for new politics, where he works with [[Steve Hilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crowdpac.co.uk/about/team|title=Crowdpac - Giving politics back to people|website=Crowdpac.co.uk|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 he co-founded [[openDemocracy.net]], a website for debate about global politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/content/articles/PDF/Interview_Barnett.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029061454/http://www.opendemocracy.net/content/articles/PDF/Interview_Barnett.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-29 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/globalisation/visions_reflections/happy_birthday_anthony_barnett#nine|title=Anthony Barnett: a radical’s fanfare|website=Opendemocracy.net|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped launch the global web movement [[Avaaz.org]] in 2007, and served as one of its first campaign directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://personaldemocracy.com/content/avaazorg-moveon-goes-international |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715071016/http://personaldemocracy.com/content/avaazorg-moveon-goes-international |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he became Director of Campaigns for [[Oxfam]], the global development movement. In 2012, he became Vice President of Global Campaigns at [[Change.org]].

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]] Hilder was campaign director for Vote4Peace.org.uk which sought to support 40 anti-[[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq war]] MPs in marginal seats, and to help elect Liberal Democrats standing in Conservative marginal seats.&lt;ref name=guardian-20050221&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/feb/21/politics.election2005 |title=£100,000 defence fund for anti-war MPs |author=Daphna Baram, David Hencke |newspaper=The Guardian |date=21 February 2005 |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilder previously stood as a self-declared "outsider" candidate for the role of [General Secretary of the Labour Party|General Secretary] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|UK Labour Party]] in 2011, and was described at the time as a "strong candidate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://labourlist.org/2011/07/labours-next-general-secretary-time-for-transparency/|title=Labour's next General Secretary: Time for transparency - LabourList|date=7 July 2011|website=Labourlist.org|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[New Statesman]] article in 2014, he wrote that his candidacy for the role had centred on "movement politics and democratic renewal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/11/new-politics-how-old-political-consensus-melting-away|title=A new politics? How the old political consensus is melting away|website=Newstatesman.com|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same piece, Hilder reported on [[Douglas Carswell]]'s successful 2014 by-election campaign after switching from the Conservatives to UKIP and on the Scottish referendum campaign, and on the subject of "new politics" through conversations with figures such as [[Jon Cruddas]], [[Rory Stewart]], [[Lisa Nandy]], [[Stewart Wood, Baron Wood of Anfield|Stewart Wood]] and [[Maurice Glasman]]. Hilder argued that "over the coming months and years, this new politics will shake the British establishment to its foundations. It has many faces but a common origin: the growing consensus that the status quo is broken and old politics is actively disempowering".

In March 2016 he called for the establishment of an English Labour Party, writing that "the Labour Party will never again win a UK parliamentary majority unless it can transform its relationship with English voters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://labourlist.org/2016/03/seven-steps-for-labour-to-win-england/|title=Seven steps for Labour to win England - LabourList|date=14 March 2016|website=Labourlist.org|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in March 2016, Hilder travelled around the US with the [[Bernie Sanders]] campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. In The Guardian, he described the campaign as "a political start-up growing exponentially in a cauldron of American discontent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/12/inside-bernie-sanders-campaign-do-or-die|title=It's not over til it's over: inside the Sanders campaign's do-or-die moment|first=Paul|last=Hilder|date=12 March 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He interviewed [[Zack Exley]] and other organizers of the campaign about their volunteer-driven approach, writing that "The Bernie campaign is working toward a political revolution" and that their digital infrastructure was "fast growing into something more powerful even than the Obama campaign". Elsewhere, he argued that the Sanders movement was "changing the laws of political physics" and that "in the most important sense, he has already won".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/2016/03/the-momentum-story-how-the-bernie-sanders-crowd-can-still-win/|title=The momentum story: How the Bernie Sanders crowd can still win|date=3 March 2016|website=Rawstory.com|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Politico]], Hilder has been "cited as an inspiration by some of the leading figures in Momentum for his work on political campaigning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McTague|first1=Tom|title=Jeremy Corbyn copies the Bernie Sanders playbook|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leader-copies-the-bernie-sanders-playbook-socialist-campaign-momentum/|accessdate=2 March 2018|publisher=Politico|date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared on The Daily Politics as a Momentum member, speaking supportively about the membership vote that shifted that movement toward a more participatory model of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Daily Politics|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b088s1qq|accessdate=2 March 2018|publisher=BBC|date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a long [[Prospect Magazine]] essay in April 2017, Hilder drew on experiences "behind the scenes with winning insurgent campaigns" to make an argument that 2016 was "the West's 1989", comparing the campaigns for Donald Trump, Brexit and Bernie Sanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hilder|first1=Paul|title=The new politics: the revolution will be digitised|journal=Prospect Magazine|date=7 April 2017|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/the-new-politics-the-revolution-will-be-digitised|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 Hilder stood again for [[General Secretary of the Labour Party]], but was not short-listed.&lt;ref name=newstatesman-20180308&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/03/paul-hilder-labour-general-secretary-NEC |title=Why I am the right person to turn Labour into a 21st century movement |last=Hilder |first=Paul |newspaper=New Statesman |date=8 March 2018 |accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=labourlist-20180315&gt;{{cite news |url=https://labourlist.org/2018/03/jennie-formby-and-christine-blower-shortlisted-for-general-secretary-post/ |title=Jennie Formby and Christine Blower shortlisted for general secretary post |last=Rodgers |first=Sienna |website=Labourlist |date=15 March 2018 |accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilder was involved in the launch of the British campaigning movement [[38 Degrees]], and served as one of its board members. In 2010 he gave a [[TED (conference)|TED]]x talk on "The Power of Food", linked to the 2010 UN Millennium Development Goals summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9UigzXGpNo|title=TEDx London - Paul Hilder|date=23 November 2010|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a trustee of the Article 1 Charitable Trust, which was founded in 2004 to lobby on issues related to [[Sudan]] and [[Darfur]].&lt;ref name=article1-who&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.article1.org/ |title=Article 1 - Who We Are |publisher=Article 1 |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anys is best known for her live streams on the Twitch platform, where she showcases her gaming experiences—most notably with ''[[League of Legends]]'' and ''[[Fortnite]]''.

== Twitch streaming ==
Anys has streamed on Twitch.tv since 2012.&lt;ref name=Shorty2017&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shortyawards.com/10th/pokimanelol|title=Pokimane - The Shorty Awards|publisher=[[Shorty Awards]]|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She gained 450,000 followers on Twitch in 2017, earning her account a place within the 100 most followed on the platform.&lt;ref name=Shorty2017/&gt; As a result of her account's rise on the platform in 2017, the [[Shorty Awards]] named her as the Best Twitch Streamer of the year.&lt;ref name=Shorty2017/&gt; The Shorty Awards detailed that her [[Let's Play|gameplay and commentary]] streams of ''[[League of Legends]]'' (''LOL''), a [[multiplayer online battle arena|MOBA]] video game, propelled her to popularity on Twitch.&lt;ref name=Shorty2017/&gt; Anys had a cameo appearance in a ''LOL'' trailer announcing a new game mode.&lt;ref name=Dedmon2018&gt;{{cite web|last=Dedmon|first=Tanner|url=http://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/05/20/league-of-legends-clash-trailer-faker/|title=League of Legends' New Clash Trailer Offers Advice From Faker|work=Comic Book|date=20 May 2018|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anys also has been noted to stream gameplay and commentary of ''[[Fortnite]]'', which she first streamed as part of a sponsorship.&lt;ref name=NicolWinn2018&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicol|first=Will|last2=Winn|first2=Riley|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/fortnite-twitch-streamer-pokimane-interview-e3-2018/|title=Twitch streamer Pokimane on playing 'Fortnite' full-time, building a community|work=[[Digital Trends]]|date=15 June 2018|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) in 2018, [[Epic Games]], the developers of ''Fortnite'', arranged a [[pro–am]] event.&lt;ref name=Bishop2018&gt;{{cite web|last=Bishop|first=Sam|url=https://www.gamereactor.eu/esports/660973/Fortnites+Celebrity+ProAm+gets+more+details/|title=Fortnite's Celebrity Pro-Am gets more details|work=[[Gamereactor]]|date=24 May 2018|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goslin2018&gt;{{cite web|last=Goslin|first=Austen|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/1/17417568/fortnite-e3-tournament-teams-players-ninja-ali-a|title=Here’s everyone playing in Epic’s major Fortnite E3 tournament|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=1 June 2018|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event paired streamers with mainstream celebrities in a match of ''Fortnite''{{'}}s [[Fortnite Battle Royale|''Battle Royale'']] mode; Anys was paired with rapper [[Desiigner]].&lt;ref name=Bishop2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goslin2018/&gt;

Tech news site ''[[Digital Trends]]'' described her "laidback but enthusiastic personality" as "perfectly suited to long-form streams."&lt;ref name=Gurwin2018&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurwin|first=Gabe|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/best-twitch-streamers-to-watch/|title=Here are 8 fun Twitch streamers you should start watching|work=[[Digital Trends]]|date=19 April 2018|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site also detailed that she frequently interacts with her audience.&lt;ref name=Gurwin2018/&gt; Aside from streaming gaming content, Anys also streams miscellaneous real-world moments, as well as a podcast.&lt;ref name=Gurwin2018/&gt;

As one of the more popular streamers on the platform, Twitch has directly partnered with Anys. In July 2018, Twitch selected her as one of 15 ambassadors for the 2018 iteration of their [[TwitchCon]] event.&lt;ref name=Weiss2018&gt;{{cite web|last=Weiss|first=Geoff|url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2018/07/06/pokimane-avajaijai-djarii-ambassadors-twitchcon/|title=Pokimane, Avajaijai, Djarii Named First-Ever 'Ambassadors' For Twitch's TwitchCon|work=[[Tubefilter]]|date=6 July 2018|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A TwitchCon Ambassador is one of Twitch's partner that headline programming for the event.&lt;ref name=Weiss2018/&gt; Later that month, Twitch also scheduled Anys as a partner for their Twitch Creator Camp, a series of broadcasts and articles designed to help content creators build successful channels.&lt;ref name=Chan2018&gt;{{cite web|last=Chan|first=Stephanie|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/24/twitch-creator-camp-has-both-crash-courses-and-master-classes-for-streamers/|title=Twitch Creator Camp has both crash-courses and master classes for streamers|work=GamesBeat|publisher=''[[VentureBeat]]''|date=24 July 2018|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social Blade, a website which tracks social media statistics lists Anys as the 21st-most followed user on Twitch, with over 1.8 million followers as of 2 August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://socialblade.com/twitch/top/100/followers|title=Top 100 Twitch Streamers Sorted by Followers|publisher=Social Blade|accessdate=2 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802083047/https://socialblade.com/twitch/top/100/followers|archive-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== YouTube ==
In addition to streaming on the Twitch platform, Anys also has two active YouTube channels: Pokimane and Poki ASMR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/pokimane/about|title=Pokimane – about page|work=Pokimane|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy2if-N3KVswQF2KjiqWx9Q/about?&amp;ab_channel=PokiASMR|title=Poki ASMR – about page|work=Poki ASMR|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former includes clips of her gaming content, vlogs, and podcast. The latter channel features videos that are part of a broader community of [[Autonomous sensory meridian response]] (ASMR) channels. Like other channels in the community, Anys creates ASMR experiences for her viewers, with the intent of triggering pleasant tingling sensations.&lt;ref name=Gutelle2018&gt;{{cite web|last=Gutelle|first=Sam|url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2018/06/23/asmr-revenue-vidcon/|title=ASMR Creators Rustle Up Some Revenue On YouTube And Beyond|work=[[Tubefilter]]|date=23 June 2018|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the topic of ASMR videos, Anys expressed, "ASMR is not a sexual thing. I wish people wouldn't dismiss it as being sexual," and noted that many of her viewers use her ASMR videos to help with falling asleep.&lt;ref name=Gutelle2018/&gt;

Anys is also a member of "Offline TV", a collaborative YouTube channel made up of [[content creators]].&lt;ref name=Lee2017&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Julia|url=https://www.riftherald.com/interviews/2017/7/14/15966098/pokimane-offline-tv-interview-lol|title=Pokimane on Offline TV, trying new things and why Scarra is most like Zilean|work=[[Polygon (website)|The Rift Herald]]|date=14 July 2017|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking about the channel, Anys stated, "it's not fun being a streamer and living alone, so we decided to come together in a way so we not only keep each other company but we can also collab and actually do good work and content for everyone else."&lt;ref name=Lee2017/&gt;

'''Qian Xuesen''', or '''Hsue-Shen Tsien''' ({{zh |s=钱学森}}; 11 December 1911 – 31 October 2009), was a prominent Chinese [[aerodynamicist]] and [[cyberneticist]] who contributed to [[aerospace engineering|rocket science]] and established [[engineering cybernetics]]. Recruited from [[MIT]], he joined [[Theodore von Karman]]'s group at [[Caltech]], including the founding of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://history.nasa.gov/biost-z.html |title = Biographies of Aerospace Officials and Policymakers |publisher = NASA |accessdate = {{Date|2015-02-02|dmy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he returned to China and made important contributions to [[China]]'s [[missile]] and [[Chinese space program|space program]].

During the [[Second Red Scare]], in the 1950s, the [[US federal government]] accused him of [[communist]] sympathies. In 1950, despite protests by his colleagues, he was stripped of his security clearance.&lt;ref name="autogenerated57"&gt;{{cite journal |date = {{Date|2008-01-07|dmy}} |title = Person of the Year: Qian Xuesen |url = http://aviationweek.com/awin/qian-xuesen-laid-foundation-china-s-space-rise |journal = Aviation Week and Space Technology |volume = 168 |pages = 57–61 |author1 = Perrett, Bradley |author2 = Asker, James R. |number = 1 |accessdate = {{Date|2015-02-02|dmy}} }} {{subreq}}&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to return to China, but he was detained at [[Terminal Island]], near [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.astronautix.com/astros/tsien.htm |author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title = Tsien |date = |website = Encyclopedia Astronautica |accessdate = {{Date|2015-02-02|dmy}} |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131013215748/http://www.astronautix.com/astros/tsien.htm |archivedate = 2013-10-13 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending five years under virtual [[house arrest]],&lt;ref name="caltech1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://today.caltech.edu/today/story-display.tcl?story_id=39604 |title = Tsien Hsue-Shen Dies |website=Caltech |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date = {{Date|2009-11-02|dmy}} |accessdate = {{Date|2015-02-02|dmy}} |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100612190920/http://today.caltech.edu/today/story-display.tcl?story_id=39604 |archivedate={{date|2010-06-12|dmy}} |deadurl = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was released in 1955 in exchange for the [[repatriation]] of American pilots who had been captured during the [[Korean War]]. He left the United States in September 1955 on the [[American President Lines]] passenger liner ''[[SS President Cleveland (1947)|SS President Cleveland]]'', arriving in China via [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="MJ550913"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LAkkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cSUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7147%2C5707600 |title = US Deporting Rocket Expert |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date = {{Date|1955-09-13|dmy}} |newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |accessdate = {{Date|2015-02-02|dmy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return, he helped lead the [[China and weapons of mass destruction|Chinese nuclear weapons program]]. This effort ultimately led to China's first successful [[596 (nuclear test)|atomic bomb test]] and [[Test No. 6|hydrogen bomb test]], making China the fifth nuclear weapons state, and achieving the fastest [[Nuclear fission|fission]]-to-[[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] development in history. Additionally, Qian's work led to the development of the [[Dongfeng (missile)|Dongfeng ballistic missile]] and the [[Chinese space program]]. For his contributions, he became known as the "Father of Chinese Rocketry", nicknamed the "King of Rocketry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://scitech.people.com.cn/GB/10294899.html |title = 钱学森：历尽险阻报效祖国 火箭之王淡泊名誉 |trans-title = Qian Xuesen: King of Rocketry who experienced obstacles in serving the Motherland |website = 人民网 (People.com.cn) |date = {{Date|2009-10-31|dmy}} |accessdate = {{Date|2009-10-31|dmy}} |language = zh }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.163.com/09/1031/17/5MVIKNT90001124J.html |title = 美国航空周刊2008年度人物:钱学森 |trans-title = US Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology Person of the Year 2008: Qian Xuesen |website = 网易探索(广州) |date = {{Date|2009-10-31|dmy}} |accessdate = {{Date|2009-11-11|dmy}} |language = zh }}&lt;/ref&gt;.He was known as one of the founding fathers of [[Two Bombs, One Satellite]] ({{zh|s=两弹一星元勋}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=23位两弹一星元勋已有17人离世 媒体解析其功绩|url=http://news.china.com/domesticgd/10000159/20160529/22762769.html|publisher=china.com|date=30 May 2016|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, in recognition of his achievements, Qian was elected an [[academician]] of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] .

He was the cousin of [[mechanical engineer]] [[Hsue-Chu Tsien]], who was involved in the aerospace industries of China and the United States; his nephew is [[Roger Y. Tsien]], the 2008 winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].

== Early life and education ==
Qian Xuesen was born in [[Hangzhou]], the capital of [[Zhejiang]] province, 180&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Shanghai]]. He left Hangzhou at the age of three when his father obtained a post in the [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Ministry of Education]] in [[Beijing]]. Qian graduated from [[The High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University]] and attended National Chiao Tung University (now [[Shanghai Jiaotong University]]) in 1934. There, he received a degree in [[mechanical engineering]] with an emphasis on railroad administration. He interned at [[Nanchang Laoyingfang Airport|Nanchang Air Force Base]].

In August 1935, Qian left China on a [[Boxer Indemnity Scholarship]] to study mechanical engineering at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he earned a [[Master of Science]] degree after one year.

While at MIT he was called Hsue-Shen Tsien. He was influenced by the methods of American engineering education, especially its focus on experimentation. This was in contrast to the contemporary approach practiced by many Chinese scientists, which emphasized theoretical elements rather than "hands-on" experience. Tsien's experiments included plotting of pitot pressures using mercury-filled manometers.

[[Theodore von Kármán]], Tsien's doctoral advisor, described their first meeting:

{{quote|One day in 1936 he came to me for advice on further graduate studies. This was our first meeting. I looked up to observe a slight short young man, with a serious look, who answered my questions with unusual precision. I was immediately impressed with the keenness and quickness of his mind, and I suggested that he enroll at Caltech for advanced study ... Tsien agreed. He worked with me on many mathematical problems. I found him to be quite imaginative, with a mathematical aptitude that he combined successfully with a great ability to visualize accurately the physical picture of natural phenomena. Even as a young student he helped clear up some of my own ideas on several difficult topics. These are gifts which I had not often encountered and Tsien and I became close colleagues.&lt;ref name=TvK&gt;Theodore von Kármán with Lee Edson (1967) ''The Wind and Beyond'', chapter 38: Dr. Tsien of Red China, pp. 308 to 15&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|309}}}}

Kármán made his home a social scene for the aerodynamicists of Pasadena, and Tsien was drawn in: "Tsien enjoyed visiting my home, and [[Josephine de Karman|my sister]] took to him because of his interesting ideas and straightforward manner."

== Career in the United States ==
[[File:Left-right Ludwig Prandtl, Theodore Von Karman, Tsien Hsue-sen.jpg|thumb|250px|Left to right: [[Ludwig Prandtl]] (German scientist),Hsue-Shen Tsien, [[Theodore von Kármán]].

Tsien's overseas cap displays his temporary [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] rank of colonel. Prandtl was von Kármán's doctoral adviser; von Kármán in turn was Tsien's.]]

Shortly after arriving at Caltech in 1936, Tsien became fascinated with the rocketry ideas of [[Frank Malina]], other students of von Kármán, and their associates, including [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]]. Along with his fellow students, he was involved in rocket-related experiments at the [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]] at Caltech. Around the university, the dangerous and explosive nature of their work earned them the nickname "Suicide Squad."&lt;ref name="caltech2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = http://www.irischang.net/books/ |last = Chang |first = Iris |authorlink = Iris Chang |title = Thread of the Silkworm |date = 1995 |publisher=BasicBooks |pages = 109–117 |location = New York |ISBN = 978-0-465-08716-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsien received his PhD from Caltech in 1939.&lt;ref name="thesis-tsien-1939"&gt;{{cite thesis |url=http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechETD:etd-01122004-105646 |title=Problems in motion of compressible fluids and reaction propulsion |date=1939 |publisher=[[California Institute of Technology]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Tsien |first=Hsue-shen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Tsien and two other members of their rocketry group drafted the first document to use the name [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], originally a proposal to the Army for developing missiles in response to Germany's [[V-2 rocket]]. This led to [[Private (missile)|Private A]], which flew in 1944, and later the [[MGM-5 Corporal|Corporal]], the [[WAC Corporal]], and other designs.

Von Kármán wrote of Tsien, "At the age of 36, he was an undisputed genius whose work was providing an enormous impetus to advances in high-speed aerodynamics and jet propulsion."&lt;ref name="2008poy"&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&amp;id=news/aw010708p1.xml |title = Qian Xuesen Laid Foundation For Space Rise in China |last = Perrett |first = Bradley | date = 2008-01-06 |journal = Aviation Week and Space Technology |volume=168 |number=1 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110521055346/http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&amp;id=news/aw010708p1.xml |archivedate = {{Date|2011-05-11|dmy}} |deadurl = yes |accessdate = {{Date|2015-02-02|dmy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he worked on designing an intercontinental space plane, which would later inspire the [[X-20 Dyna-Soar]], a precursor to the American [[Space Shuttle]].

Tsien married [[Jiang Ying (musician)|Jiang Ying]] (蒋英), a famed opera singer and the daughter of [[Jiang Baili]] (蒋百里) and his wife, Japanese nurse Satô Yato. The elder Jiang was a military strategist and adviser to [[Kuomintang]] leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. The Tsiens were married on September 14, 1947&lt;ref&gt;Chang (1995), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Shanghai]], and had two children; their son [[Qian Yonggang]](钱永刚) was born in [[Boston]] on October 13, 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Chang (1995), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; while their daughter [[Qian Yongzhen]](钱永真) was born in early 1950&lt;ref&gt;Chang (1995), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; when the family was residing in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], California.

Shortly after his wedding, Tsien returned to America to take up a teaching position at MIT. Jiang Ying would join him in December 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (1995), pp. 139-140&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, with the recommendation of von Kármán, Tsien became Robert H. Goddard Professor of Jet Propulsion at Caltech.&lt;ref name="caltech2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.caltech.edu/about/history|title=GALCIT History}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947 Tsien was granted a permanent resident permit,&lt;ref name="MJ550913" /&gt; and in 1949 he applied for naturalization, although he could not obtain citizenship.&lt;ref name="autogenerated57" /&gt; Years later, his wife Jiang Ying said in an interview with [[Phoenix Television]] that Tsien could not raise the necessary funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://v.ifeng.com/history/renwujingdian//201202/18b53c55-2072-4e66-90d8-5cea9450fd38.shtml |title = 2012-02-18我的中国心 天籁美音——蒋英 |trans-title = My Chinese Heart heavenly tone: Jiang Ying |date = {{Date|2012-02-18|dmy}} |author = 凤凰卫视 |publisher = 凤凰网/凤凰视频 |accessdate = {{Date|2015-02-02|dmy}} }} {{zh-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Detention ===
By the early 1940s, US Army Intelligence was already aware of allegations that Tsien was a Communist, but his security clearance was not suspended.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (1995), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 6, 1950 his security clearance was revoked and Tsien was questioned by the FBI. Two weeks later Tsien announced that he would be resigning from Caltech and returning to China, which by then was effectively governed by the Communist Party of China led by [[Mao Zedong]].&lt;ref name="caltech1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang (1995), p. 149-150&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, Tsien had a conversation on the subject with the then [[Under Secretary of the Navy]] [[Dan A. Kimball]], whom Tsien knew on a personal basis. After Tsien told him of the allegations, Kimball responded, "Hell, I don't think you're a Communist", at which point Tsien indicated that he still intended to leave the country, saying "I'm Chinese. I don't want to build weapons to kill my countrymen. It's that simple." Kimball then said, "I won't let you out of the country."&lt;ref name="William L 1969"&gt;William L. Ryan and Sam Summerlin, ''The China Cloud: America's tragic blunder and China's rise to nuclear power'' [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchison]] (1969) {{ISBN|978-0090959600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the firm in charge of arranging Tsien's move back to China tipped off U.S. Customs that some of the papers encountered among his possessions were marked "Secret" or "Confidential," U.S. officials seized them from a Pasadena warehouse. The U.S. Immigration and Nationalization Service issued a warrant for Tsien's arrest on August 25. Tsien claimed that the security-stamped documents were mostly written by himself and had outdated classifications, adding that, "There were some drawings and logarithm tables, etc., which someone might have mistaken for codes."&lt;ref&gt;Chang (1995), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Included in the material was a scrapbook with news clippings about the trials of those charged with atomic espionage, such as [[Klaus Fuchs]].&lt;ref&gt;Chang (1995), p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent examination of the documents showed they contained no classified material.&lt;ref name="MJ550913" /&gt;

While at Caltech, Tsien had secretly attended meetings with J. Robert Oppenheimer's brother [[Frank Oppenheimer]], [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]], and [[Frank Malina]] that were organized by the Russian-born Jewish chemist Sidney Weinbaum and called Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Monk]], ''Robert Oppenheimer: A Life Inside the Center'' [[Random House]] {{ISBN|978-0-385-50407-2}} (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  Weinbaum's trial commenced on August 30 and both Frank Oppenheimer and Parsons testified against him.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Pendle]], ''Strange Angel: The Otherworldly Life of Rocket Scientist John Whiteside Parsons'' [[Mariner Books]] (2006) {{ISBN|0-297-84853-4}} p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Weinbaum was convicted of perjury and sentenced to four years.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (1995), p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Tsien was taken into custody on September 6, 1950 for questioning&lt;ref name="MJ550913" /&gt; and for two weeks detained at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island|Terminal Island]], a low-security United States federal prison near the ports of Los Angeles and [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]].

When Tsien had returned from China with his new bride in 1947, he had answered "no" on an immigration questionnaire that asked if he ever had been a member of an organization advocating overthrow of the U.S. Government by force. This, together with an American [[CPUSA|Communist Party]] document from 1938 with Tsien's name on it, was used to argue that Tsien was a national security threat. Prosecutors also cited a cross-examination session where Tsien said, "I owe allegiance to the people of China" and would "certainly not" let the United States government make his decision for him as to whom he would owe allegiance to in the event of a conflict between the U.S. and communist China.

On April 26, 1951 Tsien was declared subject to deportation and forbidden from leaving [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] without permission, effectively placing him under [[house arrest]].&lt;ref name="William L 1969" /&gt;

During this time Tsien wrote ''Engineering Cybernetics'' which was published by [[McGraw Hill]] in 1954. The book deals with the practice of stabilizing [[servomechanism]]s. In its 18 chapters it considers non-interacting controls of many-variable systems, control design by [[perturbation theory]], and [[von Neumann]]'s theory of [[error control]] (chapter 18). Ezra Krendel reviewed&lt;ref&gt;Ezra Krendel (1955) "Review of Engineering Cybernetics", [[Journal of the Franklin Institute]] 259(4): 367&lt;/ref&gt; the book, stating that it is "difficult to overstate the value of Tsien's book to those interested in the overall theory of complex [[control system]]s." Evidently Tsien's approach is primarily practical, as Krendel notes that for servomechanisms the "usual linear design criterion of stability is inadequate and other criteria arising from the physics of the problem must be used."

== Return to China ==
Qian became the subject of five years of secret diplomacy and negotiation between the U.S. and China. During this time he lived under constant surveillance with the permission to teach without any classified research duties.&lt;ref name="caltech1" /&gt; Qian received support from his colleagues at Caltech during his incarceration, including president [[Lee DuBridge]], who flew to Washington to argue Qian's case. Caltech appointed attorney [[Grant Cooper (attorney)|Grant Cooper]] to defend Qian.

The travel ban on Qian was lifted on {{date|1955-08-04|dmy}}&lt;ref name="MJ550913" /&gt; and he resigned from Caltech shortly thereafter. Qian departed from Los Angeles aboard the ''[[SS President Cleveland (1947)|SS President Cleveland]]'' in September 1955 amidst rumors that his release was a swap for 11 U.S. airmen held captive by China since the end of the Korean War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CooeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fcsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3115%2C1559834 |title=Scientist To Be Deported By U.S. |authpr=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date={{date|1955-09-13|dmy}} |newspaper=DAytona Beach Morning Journal |agency=AP |accessdate={{date|2015-02-02|dmy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Secretary Kimball, who had tried for several years to keep Qian in the U.S., commented on his treatment: "It was the stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a Communist than I was, and we forced him to go."&lt;ref name="autogenerated57"/&gt;

Immediately upon his return, Qian began a remarkably successful career in rocket science, boosted by the reputation he garnered for his past achievements as well as Chinese state support for his nuclear research. He led and eventually became the father of the Chinese missile program, which constructed the [[Dongfeng (missile)|Dongfeng ballistic missiles]] and the [[Long March (rocket family)|Long March space rockets]].

== Chinese nuclear program and other studies ==
In October 1956, he became the director of the [[China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation|Fifth Academy]] of the [[Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of National Defense]], tasked with ballistic missile and nuclear weapons development. He was part of the overall effort that resulted in the successful "596" atomic bomb test on October 16, 1964, and the "Test No. 6" hydrogen bomb test on June 17, 1967. This was the fastest [[Nuclear fission|fission]]-to-[[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] development in history at 32 months, compared to 86 months for the United States and 75 months for the USSR, and gave China a [[thermonuclear device]] ahead of major Western powers like [[France]].

Qian's reputation as a prominent scientist who essentially defected from the United States to China gave him considerable influence in the era of [[Mao Zedong]] and afterward. Qian eventually rose through Party ranks to become a [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] member. He became associated with the ''China's Space Program - From Conception to Manned Spaceflight'' initiative.

Qian was elected as an [[academician]] of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] in 1957, a lifelong honor granted to Chinese scientists who have made significant advancements in their field. He organized scientific seminars and dedicated some of his time to training successors for his positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stdaily.com/kjrb/content/2010-10/24/content_239983.htm 科技网 -《科技日报》- 钱学森的系统科学成就和贡献] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514150132/http://www.stdaily.com/kjrb/content/2010-10/24/content_239983.htm |date=May 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was heavily involved in the eastablishment of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 1958 and served as the Chairman of the Department of Modern Mechanics of the university for a number of years.

Outside of rocketry, Qian had a presence in numerous areas of study. He was among the creators of [[systematics]], and made contributions to science and technology systems, [[somatic science]], [[engineering science]], [[military science]], [[social science]], the [[natural sciences]], geography, [[philosophy]], literature and art, and education. His advancements in the concepts, theories, and methods of the [[system science]] field include studying the [[open complex giant system]].&lt;ref&gt;钱学森：《创建系统学（新世纪版）》，上海交通大学出版社&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;钱学森：《论系统工程（新世纪版）》，上海交通大学出版社&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he helped establish the Chinese school of [[complexity science]].

From the 1980s onward, Qian had advocated the scientific investigation of [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[Qigong]], and the concept of "special human body functions". He particularly encouraged scientists to accumulate observational data on qigong so that future scientific theories could be established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Qian Xuesen |title = 《创建人体科学》 |location = Chengdu |publisher = Sichuan Education Publishing House |date = May 1989 |edition = 1st |display-authors = etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
[[File:钱学森图书馆.jpg|250px|thumb|Qian Xuesen Library, Xi'an Jiaotong University]]
Qian retired in 1991 and lived quietly in Beijing, refusing to speak to Westerners.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Grier, "The forgotten 'spy' case of a rocket scientist" ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' Vol. 92 Issue 244, November 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 Qian was awarded Caltech's ''Distinguished Alumni Award'' for his achievements. Qian eventually received his award from Caltech, and with the help of his friend [[Frank Marble]] brought it to his home in a widely covered ceremony. Furthermore, in the early 1990s, the filing cabinets containing Qian's research work were offered to him by Caltech.

Qian was invited to visit the US by the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] after the [[China-United States Relations|normalization of the Sino-US relationship]], but he refused the invitation, having wanted a formal apology for his detention. In a reminiscence published in 2002, Marble stated that he believed Qian had "lost faith in the American government" but that he had "always had very warm feelings for the American people."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pr.caltech.edu/periodicals/CaltechNews/articles/v36/tsien.html Tsien Revisited]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese government launched its manned space program in 1992, reportedly with some help from Russia due to their extended history in space. Qian's research was used as the basis for the [[Long March rocket]], which successfully launched the [[Shenzhou V]] mission in October 2003. The elderly Qian was able to watch China's first manned space mission on television from his hospital bed.
 
In 2008, he was named [[Aviation Week and Space Technology]] Person of the Year.

== In popular culture ==
[[Science fiction]] author [[Arthur C. Clarke]], in his novel ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]],'' named a Chinese spaceship after him. The science fiction novel series ''[[The Expanse (novel series)|The Expanse]]'' by [[James S. A. Corey]] also named a Martian spaceship after him (MCRN Xuesen). In the 1981 novel [[Noble House]] by [[James Clavell]], the American-Chinese scientist who defected to China and helped develop the first atom bomb for China, Dr. Joseph Yu, is a fictionalized version of Dr. Qian Xuesen.

'''Ramón Unzaga Asla''' (1894 – 31 August 1923) was a [[Chile]]an citizen football player. He was born in [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]]. Unzaga  emigrated to [[Talcahuano]], [[Chile]], in 1906 at 12 years of age, with his parents. In 1912 the eighteen-year-old Unzaga impressed the Talcahuano sports delegation with his football ability, so they signed him to the football club. He began his career and adopted the Chilean nationality. Unzaga is attributed as the first person to create the [[bicycle kick]], devising the move playing for his club team in 1914 in ''El Morro'' stadium of Talcahuano. The kick is labeled the ''chorera'' in honor of the team he played for that was called the ''escuela chorera'' (chorera school) at the time. In the [[Copa America]] of 1916 and 1920 playing for the Chilean national team, Unzaga repeated the kick on various occasions in which the Argentine press labels the kick as ''la chilena''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euskonews.com/0332zbk/kosmo33201.html |title=::: Euskonews &amp;amp; Media ::: Kosmopolita ::: La &amp;#8220;chilena&amp;#8221; es cosa de vascos |publisher=Euskonews.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unzaga received many offers to play with international football clubs but always chose to stay with Club Atlético y de Fútbol Estrella de Mar of Talcahuano. On May 15, 2014, the municipality of Talcahuano inaugurated a monument of Ramon Unzaga in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://papeldigital.info/lahora/2014/05/07/01/paginas/024.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601015449/http://papeldigital.info/lahora/2014/05/07/01/paginas/024.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that Unzaga's move was born in the ''El Morro Stadium'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://diario.elmercurio.cl/detalle/index.asp?id={f4ebea2f-b492-4745-a336-cd19b8ae4fcd} |title=Los ilustres nombres de los estadios chilenos |publisher=emol.cl |date= 2 January 2010|accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in its honor that the stadium was renamed after him.

'''Robert Oliver Lowery''' (April 20, 1916 – July 24, 2001) was sworn in as the 21st [[New York City Fire Commissioner]] by Mayor [[John V. Lindsay]] on January 1, 1966 and served in that position until his resignation on September 29, 1973.

==Biography==
Leaving a Harlem job as head usher for the [[The Harlem Alhambra|Alhambra]] Theatre for his first civil service appointment, He was for a year a Subway [[Conductor (rail)|Conductor]] in the [[New York City Subway|Transit Authority]], having taken a number of tests.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/27/nyregion/robert-lowery-first-black-fire-commissioner-dies-at-85.html&lt;/ref&gt; The next call came from the [[New York City Fire Department]] (FDNY). Lowery was appointed as a [[Firefighter|fireman]] in 1941. He was promoted to [[fire marshal]] in 1946, and that same year won a commendation for arresting a man for 30 acts of [[arson]] and [[burglary]]. In 1960, he was cited for capturing an armed arsonist, and the next year became an acting lieutenant in the Bureau of Fire Investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vulcansocietyfdny.org/vulcan_society_history.htm Vulcan Society FDNY - Vulcan Society History]&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time Lowery was an active member of the [[Vulcan Society]], serving as its President from 1946 to 1950, 1953 and 1954, 1957, and from 1959 to 1963.

On November 14, 1963, Lowery was appointed Deputy Fire Commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Negro Appointed Deputy Fire Aide. Lowery Succeeds Ortiz |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/11/15/archives/negro-appointed-deputy-fire-aide-lowery-succeeds-ortiz-2-puerto.html |quote= |work=[[New York Times]] |date=November 15, 1963 |accessdate=2010-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He addressed the racial issue straightforwardly, striving to increase the proportion of blacks and the sensitivity of whites. He also raised the number of black firefighters assigned to black neighborhoods, as well as the number of blacks in leadership roles.

On November 23, 1965, incoming [[Mayor Lindsay]] announced the appointment of Lowery as Fire Commissioner of the New York City Fire Department. His was the first commissioner level appointment announced by the Mayor-elect. Lowery, who was the first [[African American]] to serve as a Fire Commissioner of a major U.S. city, served in that position for more than 7 years until his resignation on September 29, 1973 in order to campaign for then-Controller [[Abraham D. Beame]], the Democratic candidate for Mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Lindsay Selects A Negro To Head Fire Department.

Lowery died on July 24, 2001 in [[Manhattan]] at the age of 85.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Robert Lowery, First Black Fire Commissioner, Dies at 85 |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40C1FF73F590C748EDDAE0894D9404482 |quote=Robert O. Lowery, the city's first black fire commissioner who served at a time when arson-fueled blazes raged through the city's minority neighborhoods, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. He was 85 and had homes in Washington Heights and on the island of St. Vincent, his daughter Trudy Erwin said. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=July 27, 2001 |accessdate=2010-03-25 | first=Douglas | last=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
Either as tribute or by happenstance, his name is shown prominently in a scene of the first movie ''[[The Godfather]]'', printed in bold red letters on a hospital fire safety box in the scene where [[Michael Corleone]] protects his father, [[Vito Corleone]], against would-be assassins in the absence of his bodyguards. The action is set to be prior to 1946, however, so the reference is anachronistic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1918">'''Samuel ben Hayyim Vital''' (1598 – 1677) was a [[Kabalist]] born in [[Damascus]] in the latter half of the sixteenth century.  While still young he married a daughter of Isaiah Pinto, rabbi of Damascus. Poverty compelled him to emigrate to [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]], where, through the influence of prominent men, he was placed in charge of the cabalistic society Tiḳḳune ha-Teshubah. After a brief residence there he went to [[Safed]], where he instructed the physician [[Joseph Zemah]] in [[Kabbalah|Kabala]]. In the middle of the 17th century he returned to Egypt, where he died.

Samuel Vital was the author of both cabalistic and [[rabbinical]] works. Among the former may be noted the ''Shemonah She'arim,'' an introduction to the Cabala, later embodied in the ''Eẓ Ḥayyim'' (Zolkiev, 1772; Korzec, 1785). Among his unpublished writings mention may be made of his ''Sefer Toẓe'ot Ḥayyim,'' a commentary on the [[Bible]], and his ''Sefer Ta'alumot Ḥokmah,'' on the Cabala.

'''Sarah Fuller Flower Adams''' (or '''Sally Adams'''&lt;ref name="Orlando"/&gt;) (1805 – 1848) was an [[England|English]] poet and [[hymnwriter]], best known for writing the words of the hymn "[[Nearer, My God, to Thee]]".&lt;ref name = Blain&gt;{{cite|first =Virginia H.|last=Blain|article=Adams, Sarah Flower (1805–1848)|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/129|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and education==
Sarah Fuller Flower was born 22 February 1805, at [[Old Harlow]], [[Essex]],{{sfn|Hatfield|1884|p=1}} and baptised in September 1806 at the Water Lane Independent Chapel in [[Bishops Stortford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title = FamilySearch|url = https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:NPSW-JMN |access-date = 4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the younger daughter of the radical editor [[Benjamin Flower]],{{sfn|Julian|1892|p=16}} and his wife Eliza Gould.&lt;ref name = Blain/&gt;

Her father's mother Martha, sister of the wealthy bankers [[William Fuller (banker)|William Fuller]] and [[Richard Fuller (died 1782)|Richard Fuller]], had died the month before Adam's birth. Her elder sister was the composer [[Eliza Flower]].&lt;ref name = Blain/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hale | first = Sarah Josepha Buell | authorlink = Sarah Josepha Hale | title = Woman's Record; Or, Sketches of All Distinguished Women, from the Beginning... | publisher = Harper &amp; bros | year = 1853 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=13UEAAAAYAAJ}}  874 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Her uncles included [[Richard Flower (settler)|Richard Flower]], who emigrated to the United States in 1822 and was a founder of the town of [[Albion, Illinois]];{{sfn|Hatfield|1884|p=4}} and the nonconformist minister [[John Clayton (minister)|John Clayton]].

Her mother died when she was only five years old and initially her father, a liberal in politics and religion,{{sfn|Hatfield|1884|p=2}} brought the daughters up, taking a hand in their education. The family moved to [[Dalston]] in [[Middlesex]], where they met the writer [[Harriet Martineau]], who was struck by the two sisters and used them for her novel “Deerbrook”. In 1823, on a holiday in [[Scotland]] with friends of the radical preacher [[William Johnson Fox]], the minister of South Place Unitarian Chapel, London, who was a frequent visitor to their home, Adam broke the female record for climbing up [[Ben Lomond]]. Back home, the girls became friends with the young poet [[Robert Browning]], who discussed his religious doubts with Adam.&lt;ref name = Blain/&gt;

==Career==
After the father's death, about 1825, the sisters became members of the Fox household.{{sfn|American Unitarian Association|1922|p=1094}} Both sisters 
began literary pursuits, and Adam first fell ill with what became [[tuberculosis]]. Soon after, the sisters moved to [[Upper Clapton]], a suburb of [[London]]. They attached themselves to the [[Conway Hall Ethical Society|religious society]] worshipping in South Place, [[Finsbury]], under the pastoral care of Fox. He encouraged and sympathized with the sisters, and they in turn helped him in his work. Eliza, the elder, devoted herself to enriching the musical part of the Chapel service, while Adams contributed hymns.{{sfn|American Unitarian Association|1922|p=1094}} Fox was one of the founders of the ''[[Westminster Review]]''.{{sfn|Hatfield|1884|p=2}} and his Unitarian magazine, the ''[[Monthly Repository]]'', printed essays, poems and stories by [[William Bridges Adams]], polemicist and railway engineer, who Adam met at the house of her friend, the feminist philosopher [[Harriet Taylor Mill]]. The two married in 1834,&lt;ref name = Blain/&gt; setting up house at [[Loughton]] in Essex. In 1837, he distinguished himself as the author of an elaborate volume on ''English Pleasure Carriages'', and another on ''The Construction of Common Roads and Railroads''. He was also a contributor to some of the principal reviews and newspapers.{{sfn|Hatfield|1884|p=2}}

Encouraged by her husband, Adams turned to acting and in the 1837 season at [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] played [[Lady Macbeth]], followed by [[Portia (The Merchant of Venice)|Portia]] and [[Lady Teazle]], all successes. Though offered a role at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], then a springboard for the [[West End theatre|West End]], her health broke down and she returned to literature.&lt;ref name = Blain/&gt;

In 1841, she published her longest work, ''Vivia Perpetua, A Dramatic Poem''. In it, a young wife who refuses to submit to male control and renounce her [[Christian]] beliefs is put to death. She contributed to the ''Westminster Review'', including a critique of [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]'s poetry, and wrote political verses, some for the [[Anti-Corn Law League]]. Her work often advocated equal treatment for women and for the working class.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} At the solicitation of her pastor, she also contributed thirteen hymns to the compilation prepared by him for the use of his chapel, published 1840-41, in two parts, six in the first and seven in the second part. Of these, the two best known —" Nearer, my God! to Thee," and "He sendeth sun, he sendeth shower"— are in the second part. For this work, her sister, Eliza, wrote sixty-two tunes. Her only other publication, a catechism for children, entitled "The Flock at the Fountain," appeared in 1845.{{sfn|Hatfield|1884|p=3}} Her hymn, "Nearer, my God! to Thee", was introduced to American Christians in the "Service Book," published (1844) by Rev. James Freeman Clarke, D.D., of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], from where it was soon transferred to other collections.{{sfn|Hatfield|1884|p=4}} A selection of hymns she wrote, published by Fox, included her best-known piece, "Nearer, My God, to Thee", reportedly played by the band as the [[RMS Titanic]] sank in 1912.&lt;ref name = Blain/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Titanic's Band | url = http://www.titanic-titanic.com/titanic_band.shtml |publisher= Titanic-Titanic |accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
A Unitarian in belief, her career was hampered by deafness she had inherited from her father and,  inheriting their mother's feebleness, both sisters yielded to disease in middle age. Eliza, after a lingering illness, died in December 1846 and, worn down by caring for her invalid sister, Adam's health gradually declined. She died on 14 August 1848 at the age of 43 and  was buried beside her sister and parents in the Forest Street cemetery near Harlow.{{sfn|Hatfield|1884|p=3}}{{sfn|Hatfield|1884|p=4}}&lt;ref name = Blain/&gt;{{sfn|Julian|1892|p=16}} At her grave was sung the only other hymn of hers which was widely known, “He sendeth sun, he sendeth shower”.{{sfn|American Unitarian Association|1922|p=1094}}

A [[blue plaque]] honouring the husband and wife was placed at their Loughton home: they had no children. [[Richard Garnett (writer)|Richard Garnett]] wrote of her:— "All who knew Mrs. Adams personally speak of her with enthusiasm; she is described as a woman of singular beauty and attractiveness, delicate and truly feminine, high-minded, and in her days of health playful and high-spirited."[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Adams,_Sarah_Flower_(DNB00)]

'''Stephan A. Hoeller''' (November 27, 1931)&lt;ref&gt;National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). ''U.S. Naturalization Record Indexes, 1791-1992'' (Provo, UT: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc.), 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is an American author and scholar. He was born in [[Budapest]], [[Kingdom_of_Hungary_(1920–46)|Hungary]] into a family of Austro-Hungarian nobility. Exiled from his native country as the result of the communist rule subsequent to [[World War II]], he studied in various academic institutions in [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], and [[Italy]]. In January 1952 he emigrated to the United States on the steamship General Muir from the Port of Bremerhaven and has resided in Southern California ever since.&lt;ref name="questbooks.net"&gt;http://www.questbooks.net/author.cfm?authornum=14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

An author and scholar of [[Gnosticism]] and [[Jungian psychology]], Hoeller is Regionary Bishop of [[Ecclesia Gnostica]], and the senior holder of the English Gnostic transmission in America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnosis.org/ecclesia/ecclesia.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoeller was ordained to the priesthood of the [[American Catholic Church (1915)|American Catholic Church]] by Bishop Lowell P. Wadle in 1958.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} He was consecrated to the Gnostic episcopate by [[Richard Duc de Palatine]] on April 9, 1967.&lt;ref name="questbooks.net"/&gt;  Ronald Powell (who took the ecclesiastical name Richard Jean Chretien Duc de Palatine) had established a modern-day Gnostic church, the Pre-Nicene Gnostic Catholic Church, in England during the 1950s - de Palatine received his successions from British independent prelate Hugh de Wilmott-Newman in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoeller|first=Stephan|title=Wandering Bishops: Not All Roads Lead to Rome|url=http://www.gnosis.org/wandering_bishops.htm|work=Wandering Bishops: Not All Roads Lead to Rome|publisher=The Gnosis Archive|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   After the death of Duc de Palatine in the 1970s, Hoeller abbreviated the church's name, in Latin form, to [[Ecclesia Gnostica]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.gnosis.org/ecclesia/ecclesia.htm Introduction to the Ecclesia Gnostica&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  He has continued to serve as bishop of the Ecclesia Gnostica for over four decades.

Hoeller has lectured in Australia, New Zealand, England, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Hungary, Germany, and the United States. He is a former member of the lecturing faculty of the late [[Manly P. Hall]]'s [[Philosophical Research Society]], and a national speaker for the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society of America]].  Since 1963 he has been Director of Studies for the [[Gnostic Society]] centered in Los Angeles, where he has lectured every Friday evening for many decades. He was a frequent contributor to ''[[Gnosis (magazine)|Gnosis]]'' magazine; and has also written for ''Quest Magazine'' and for many professional journals.  He is Professor Emeritus of Comparative Religion at the College of Oriental Studies in Los Angeles, California.

During a 2003 interview, he talked about Gnosticism:

{{Quote|I think we could describe it as a very early form of Christianity, very different in many respects from what Christianity became later on. It is much more individualistic. It is much more orientated toward the personal, spiritual advancement and transformation of the individual, regarding figures such as Jesus as being helpers rather than sacrificial saviors. It is a form of religion that has a much more ecumenical and universal scope in terms of its relationship to spiritual, religious traditions other than the Christian.&lt;ref name="paranoiamagazine.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paranoiamagazine.com/hoeller.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031228044719/http://www.paranoiamagazine.com/hoeller.html |archivedate=2003-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

I would say that this appears to be, as far as Gnosticism is concerned, the time that the Greeks called the kairos, the time when the Gods are reborn. We live in an age, I think, when certain timeless ideas, which have been submerged and subdued for a long time, are making their appearance once again. In that respect we're living in very interesting times as the Chinese would say. Interesting times, spiritually powerful times, always cast a great shadow. There will also be great difficulties, but I think that Gnostic traditions, along with a number of kindred ideas, are being reborn at this time, and will have a significant influence in the future. Those of us who find ourselves working within that field are singularly blessed that we can do this work at this particular time. So I feel I'm at the right place and at the right time and I am profoundly grateful for all of that.&lt;ref name="paranoiamagazine.com"/&gt;}}

'''Theresa Goh Rui Si''' &lt;small&gt;[[Pingat Bakti Masyarakat|PBM]]&lt;/small&gt; ({{zh|s=吴蕊思|zh|t=吳蕊思|p=Wú Ruǐ Sī}}; born 16 February 1987) is a [[Singapore]]an [[swimming (sport)|swimmer]] and [[Paralympic Games|Paralympic]] medalist, with a bronze in the SB4 100m breaststroke at the [[2016 Summer Paralympics]]. She holds the [[List of IPC world records in swimming – Women's long course|world records]] for the SB4 50&amp;nbsp;metres and 200&amp;nbsp;metres breaststroke events.

Due to [[congenital disorder|congenital]] [[spina bifida]], she does not have use of her legs. Nonetheless, she started swimming at the age of five years, and began taking part in competitions at age 12. She soon established herself as a top competitor, winning medals at, among others, the [[ASEAN ParaGames]] (2001, 2003, 2005 and 2008), Far East and South Pacific Games Federation for the Disabled (FESPIC) Games (now known as the [[Asian Para Games]]) (2002), [[World Wheelchair and Amputee Games|International Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Sports Federation (ISMWSF) World Wheelchair Games]] (2003), National Swimming Championships (2004), and [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) World Swimming Championships (2006).

In March 2007, at the Danish Open in [[Esbjerg]], [[Denmark]], Goh took top honours in the 100&amp;nbsp;metres breaststroke, 100&amp;nbsp;metres butterfly, 100&amp;nbsp;freestyle and 200&amp;nbsp;metres individual [[medley swimming|medley]]. At the [[2008 ASEAN ParaGames|4th ASEAN ParaGames]] held in [[Nakhon Ratchasima]] (Korat), Thailand, in January 2008, Goh broke the record she set in May 2007 at the German International Disability Swimming Championships to win the gold in the 50&amp;nbsp;metres breaststroke in a world and FESPIC record time of 52.62&amp;nbsp;seconds. She achieved another gold in the 200&amp;nbsp;metres freestyle.

She said she did so to gain "mental closure" after having missed the bronze in the 100&amp;nbsp;metres breaststroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Sim Chi Yin|title=Goh gains closure in final race|newspaper=The Straits Times (Sport)|date=16 September 2008|page=B12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2008, Goh was employed by [[Standard Chartered Bank]] as a marketing services officer while on their Programme for Elite Athletes. She hopes to continue swimming full-time and to become a swimming coach.&lt;ref name="2008 ASEAN ParaGames"/&gt;

In the [[2016 Summer Paralympics]], Goh won a bronze medal in the SB4 100m breaststroke final, with a time of 1 minute and 55.55 seconds.

==Murder==
On April 24, 1979, a [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist]] [[Ulster Defence Association]] [[death squad]] consisting of William John Mullan and Billy Dodds visited Carson's home on Rosevale Street in [[Belfast]] with the intention to kill him. They were told by his young son and daughter that their parents were not home, and left. They returned an hour later, and since the 32-year-old Carson was still not home, the men sat with his 11-year-old daughter watching television, until he returned, at which point they shot him in front of his child. He died in hospital in the early morning hours.&lt;ref name="McGuigan"&gt;McGuigan, Ciaran, [[Belfast Telegraph]], "UFF killer’s compo bid is rejected", December 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Irish Times]], [http://www.irishtimes.com/news/3-722-lives-lost-the-price-of-peace-in-a-divided-island-1.1204985 3,722 dead between 1966 and 2007...], May 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Malcolm.

==Aftermath==
Mullan served 14 years for the murder, and was re-arrested while planning a [[bank robbery|robbery]] at First Trust Bank in 2004.

'''William Jones''' (1809–1873) was a political [[Political radicalism|Radical]] and [[Chartism|Chartist]], who was a former actor, working as a watchmaker at [[Pontypool]] in [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] and also kept a beer house.

He was prosecuted for his part in the Chartist [[Newport Rising]] at [[Newport, Monmouthshire]] on 4 November 1839.

Along with [[John Frost (Chartist)|John Frost]] and [[Zephaniah Williams]], he was appointed a leader of a column of men in what is sometimes regarded as the greatest armed rebellion in 19th-century Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Royal, ''Chartism'', Longman, London: 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones was supposed to be bringing men to Newport from the Pontypool area and the eastern valleys of Monmouthshire on the night of the rising, but they never arrived, delaying the main body of Chartists final march into Newport into the daylight hours and thus partly contributing to its defeat.

[[File:William Jones Chartist.jpg|thumb|left|Jones on trial]]
He was captured a few days after the rising. He was imprisoned in [[Monmouth County Gaol]] and placed on trial at [[Shire Hall, Monmouth|the Shire Hall]] in Monmouth. He was sentenced to death for [[High Treason]], but his sentence was commuted and he was sentenced to [[penal transportation]] to Australia for life.

== Exile in Australia ==
While in exile, members of the Chartist movement continued to advocate for the repatriation of the leaders of the Newport Rising. In March 1847, the House of Commons debated a proposal for their repatriation, but it was defeated by 196 votes to 31 (including the vote of Disraeli). The convicts won partial pardon in 1854 and total pardon in 1856. John Frost returned to England. Jones decided to remain behind in Australia and stuck by his watchmakers's trade. He died in poverty in 1873.
