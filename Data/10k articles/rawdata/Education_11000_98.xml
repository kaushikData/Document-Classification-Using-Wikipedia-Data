The '''Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education''' ('''ACGME''') is the body responsible for accrediting the majority  of [[Graduate medical education|graduate medical training programs]] (i.e., internships, residencies, and fellowships, a.k.a. subspecialty residencies) for [[physicians]] in the [[United States]]. It is a [[non-profit]] private council that evaluates and accredits [[medical residency]] and internship programs. The ACGME was founded in 1981 and was preceded by the [[Liaison Committee for Graduate Medical Education]], which was established in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/home/home.asp |title=ACGME |publisher=Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education |accessdate=2007-08-18 |format= |work= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813041721/http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/home/home.asp |archivedate=13 August 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ACGME currently oversees the post-graduate education and training for all [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] and the majority of [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]] physicians in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Salsberg, Edward.

The ACGME's member organizations are the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]], [[American Hospital Association]], [[American Medical Association]], [[Association of American Medical Colleges]], and the Council of Medical Specialty Societies each of whom appoints four members to the ACGME's board of directors.

In 2014, the ACGME, the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) and the [[American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine]] (AACOM) announced an agreement to pursue a single, unified accreditation system for graduate medical education programs in the United States beginning in 2015. Plans call for the ACGME to accredit all osteopathic graduate medical education programs by 2020.
==Projects==
The Clinical Learning Environment Review project promotes [[patient safety]], quality during changes in care, appropriate supervision of care, managing fatigue of residents, and increasing the professionalism of physicians.&lt;ref name="WeissWagner2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weiss|first1=Kevin B.|last2=Wagner|first2=Robin|last3=Nasca|first3=Thomas J.|title=Development, Testing, and Implementation of the ACGME Clinical Learning Environment Review (CLER) Program|journal=Journal of Graduate Medical Education|volume=4|issue=3|year=2012|pages=396–398|issn=1949-8349|doi=10.4300/JGME-04-03-31|pmc=3444205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 30, 2020, all US residency programs will be ACGME-accredited. Before this date, only MD residencies were ACGME-accredited, while DO residencies were AOA-accredited.

===Outcome Project===
The Outcome Project began in 2001 with a set of assessments for measuring physician competence.&lt;ref name="SwingClyman2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swing|first1=Susan R.|last2=Clyman|first2=Stephen G.|last3=Holmboe|first3=Eric S.|last4=Williams|first4=Reed G.|title=Advancing Resident Assessment in Graduate Medical Education|journal=Journal of Graduate Medical Education|volume=1|issue=2|year=2009|pages=278–286|issn=1949-8349|doi=10.4300/JGME-D-09-00010.1|pmc=2931233}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, it was recognized that ACGME measurements could not reliably be evaluated independently of each other and instead should be used together and with other measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lurie|first1=SJ|last2=Mooney|first2=CJ|last3=Lyness|first3=JM|title=Measurement of the general competencies of the accreditation council for graduate medical education: a systematic review.|journal=Academic Medicine|date=March 2009|volume=84|issue=3|pages=301–9|pmid=19240434|doi=10.1097/acm.0b013e3181971f08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3716">The '''American Association of Teachers of French''' (AATF) is a professional organisation for teachers of [[French language|French]] in the United States founded in 1927. Teachers may be involved in primary, secondary, or university education. Additionally, retired and student teachers are welcome. Currently there are about 10,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Convention annuelle de l'association américaine des professeurs de français à San Jose|url=http://www.france-amerique.com/articles/2009/07/01/convention_annuelle_de_l_association_americaine_des_professeurs_de_francais_a_san_jose.html|accessdate=27 December 2012|newspaper=France-Amérique|date=1 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the interest in French has declined in the United States since 1980's, the organisation has held annual convention to bring together a cross-section of teachers and educators to find ways to promote French in traditional curriculum and other methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teachers Try to Renew Interest in French|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/nyregion/teachers-try-to-renew-interest-in-french.html|accessdate=27 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AATF's official publication is called ''The French Review'', which has the largest circulation of any scholarly journal on the French language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The FRENCH REVIEW|url=http://www.wwu.edu/depts/mcl/french/fr/|publisher=Western Washington University|accessdate=27 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117202627/http://www.wwu.edu/depts/mcl/french/FR/|archive-date=2012-11-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National French Contest==
The '''National French Contest''' was established in 1936 by the Executive Council of AATF to help determine the relative student achievement in the learning of French in the United States. Originally the contest was called '''Le Grand Concours National de Français'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PMA students top in French contest|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=KFIQUvoPKFAC&amp;dat=19820519&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en|accessdate=27 December 2012|newspaper=Nashua Telegraph|date=19 May 1982|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later shortened to '''Le Grand Concours'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=1936–2010: Le Grand Concurs Celebrates 75 Years|journal=National Bulletin|date=November 2009|volume=35|issue=2|pages=1|url=http://www.frenchteachers.org/bulletin/archives/2000s/2009-34.2nov.pdf|accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The annual contest currently has around 100,000 participants from elementary schools to high schools in all chapters nationwide. There are seven levels. The first level called FLES is for elementary school students. Levels 01, and 1 to 5 are for grades 7 to 12. In each level, there are divisions A to E to separate students based on prior exposure to French. About 0.1% of all participants receive gold medals for National Rank 1. About 0.7% receive silver medals for National Ranks 2 to 3. About 8% receive bronze medals for National Ranks 4 to 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Grand Concours 2011 - Statistics |url=http://www.frenchteachers.org/concours/Resources/gc_stats.html |publisher=American Association of Teachers of French |accessdate=27 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617012133/http://www.frenchteachers.org/concours/Resources/gc_stats.html |archivedate=June 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bejan''' (Fr. ''bejaune'', from ''bec jaune'', "yellow beak," in allusion to unfledged birds, and the equivalent to Ger. ''Gelbschnabel'') was a term for [[First year|freshmen]], or [[Undergraduate education|undergraduates]] of the first year, in the [[Universities in Scotland#Middle Ages|Scottish universities]]. The term is rarely used today except at the [[University of Aberdeen]] Aberdeen; at the [[University of St Andrews]] the word has mutated to "Bejant" (female: Bejantine).

The phrase was introduced from the [[List of colleges and universities in France|French universities]], where the levying of ''bejaunium'' ("footing-money") had been prohibited by the statutes of the [[Orléans#University_and_other_education|university of Orleans]] in 1365 and by those of [[University of Toulouse|Toulouse]] in 1401. In 1493 the election of an ''Abbas Bejanorum'' (Abbot of the Freshmen) was forbidden in the [[university of Paris]].

The '''Bogdanov affair''' is an academic dispute regarding the legitimacy of a series of [[theoretical physics]] papers written by French twins [[Igor and Grichka Bogdanoff|Igor and Grichka Bogdanov]] (alternately spelt Bogdanoff). These papers were published in reputable [[scientific journal]]s, and were alleged by their authors to culminate in a proposed theory for describing what occurred at the [[Big Bang]].

The controversy began in 2002 when Max Niedermaier, a physicist at the [[University of Tours]], emailed [[Ezra T. Newman|Ted Newman]], a physicist at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], alleging that the twins—who had previously gained celebrity status for a science fiction television program in France—had "spoofed" their PhD theses.&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt; Rumors spread on [[Usenet]] newsgroups that the work was a deliberate hoax intended to target weaknesses in the [[peer review]] system employed by the physics community to select papers for publication in academic journals. While the Bogdanov brothers continued to defend the veracity of their work, the debate over whether or not the work represented a contribution to physics spread from Usenet to many other Internet forums, including the [[blog]]s of notable physicists. The ensuing dispute received [[#Media involvement|considerable coverage]] in the mainstream media.&lt;ref name="Baez web" /&gt; A [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS) internal report eventually concluded that their theses had no scientific value.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/actualite-economique/les-bogdanov-reclamaient-1-million-ils-sont-condamnes-a-payer-2000-euros_1695746.html|title=Les Bogdanov réclamaient un million, ils sont condamnés à payer 2000 euros|work=[[L'Express]]|date=2015-07-02|access-date=2018-02-25|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors have [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degrees from the [[University of Burgundy]]; Grichka Bogdanov received his degree in mathematics, and Igor Bogdanov received his in theoretical physics (in 1999 and 2002 respectively). Both were given the low, unusual, but passing grade of "honorable"; Igor initially failed and was required to publish three papers in peer-reviewed journals before being given a degree. When later challenges to the legitimacy of the Bogdanovs' papers arose, the debate spread to the question of whether a publication requirement is a valid means of evaluating students' work. The incident also prompted considerable reflection among physicists as to how and why the peer review system can fail.

==Origin of the affair==
[[Image:Universe expansion-en.svg|thumb|right|299px|The Bogdanov papers assert that there is evidence of what happened during the first 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds of the [[Big Bang]], known as the [[Planck era]].

In 1991 the Bogdanovs published a book, ''Dieu et la Science'' (''God and Science''), drawn from interviews with the philosopher [[Jean Guitton]], which became a French bestseller.&lt;ref name="overbye" /&gt; This book provoked a dispute of its own when [[University of Virginia]] astronomy professor [[Trinh Xuan Thuan]] accused the Bogdanovs of [[plagiarism|plagiarizing]] his 1988&lt;ref name='newscientist'&gt;{{cite news | first=Hazel | last=Muir | title=Twins raise ruckus | date=2002-11-16  | work =New Scientist | pages =6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; book ''The Secret Melody: And Man Created the Universe''.  After a legal battle in France, Thuan and the Bogdanovs settled out of court, and the Bogdanovs later denied all wrongdoing. Thuan suggests that the plagiarism suit pressed the brothers to obtain doctorates as fast as possible, since (according to Thuan) the back cover of the book claimed that the Bogdanovs held doctorates when they did not.&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt; In 1993, the brothers began work toward doctorates, first working under the mathematical physicist Moshé Flato of the [[University of Burgundy]]. Flato died in 1998, and his colleague Daniel Sternheimer (of CNRS) took over the job of supervising the Bogdanovs. According to Sternheimer, the twins viewed themselves as "the Einstein brothers" and had a propensity to voice vague, "impressionistic" statements; he considered guiding their efforts "like teaching [[My Fair Lady]] to speak with an Oxford accent."&lt;ref name="overbye"/&gt;  As he told ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]],'' Sternheimer did not consider himself an expert in all the topics Grichka Bogdanov included in his thesis, but judged that those portions within his specialty were Ph.D.-quality work.&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt;

Grichka Bogdanov was given a Ph.D. by the University of Burgundy ([[Dijon]]) in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;Grichka Bogdanoff, ''Fluctuations quantiques de la signature de la métrique à l'échelle de Planck'', 1999; doctorate in mathematics from the University of Dijon (University of Burgundy), supervised by Daniel Sternheimer, [http://www.sudoc.abes.fr/xslt/DB=2.1/SET=5/TTL=1/CMD?ACT=SRCHM&amp;ACT0=SRCH&amp;MATCFILTER=Y&amp;MATCSET=Y&amp;NOSCAN=Y&amp;PARSE_MNEMONICS=N&amp;PARSE_OPWORDS=N&amp;PARSE_OLDSETS=N&amp;IMPLAND=Y&amp;screen_mode=search&amp;IKT0=1004&amp;TRM0=bogdanoff+grichka&amp;ACT1=*&amp;IKT1=4&amp;TRM1=fluctuations&amp;ACT2=*&amp;IKT2=1016&amp;TRM2=&amp;ACT3=*&amp;IKT3=1016&amp;TRM3=&amp;SRT=RLV&amp;ADI_TAA=&amp;ADI_LND=&amp;ADI_JVU=&amp;ADI_MAT=B&amp;ADI_MAT=T&amp;ADI_MAT=F&amp;ADI_MAT=O&amp;ADI_MAT=A&amp;ADI_MAT=M&amp;ADI_MAT=N&amp;ADI_MAT=G&amp;ADI_MAT=V&amp;ADI_MAT=I&amp;ADI_MAT=K&amp;ADI_MAT=Y&amp;ADI_MAT=X&amp;ILN_DEP_BIB=DEP&amp;ADI_BIB= entry in the French academic library directory].&lt;/ref&gt; though this doctorate is sometimes erroneously described as having been granted by the [[École Polytechnique]].&lt;ref name="overbye" /&gt;  He originally applied for a degree in physics, but was instead given one in mathematics,  and was first required to significantly rewrite his thesis, de-emphasizing the physics content.&lt;ref name="chronicle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="le-monde"&gt;{{fr icon}} Hervé Morin.

In 2002, after publishing the requisite articles, Igor was given a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Burgundy.&lt;ref name="overbye" /&gt;  Both of the brothers received the lowest passing grade of "honorable," which is seldom given, as Daniel Sternheimer told ''[[New York Times]]'' science reporter [[Dennis Overbye]].&lt;ref name="overbye"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chronicle" /&gt; In justifying the conferring of doctoral degrees to the Bogdanovs, Sternheimer told the ''Times'', "These guys worked for 10 years without pay. They have the right to have their work recognized with a diploma, which is nothing much these days."&lt;ref name="overbye"/&gt;

In 2001 and 2002 the brothers published five papers in peer-reviewed physics journals, including ''[[Annals of Physics]]'' and ''[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]]''.&lt;ref name="bogdanov-spires"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inspirehep.net/search?p=FIND+a+BOGDANOFF|title=INSPIRE-HEP citation information for Bogdanov papers|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='economist'&gt;{{cite news | title=Publish and perish |url=http://www.economist.com/node/1441745 | date=2002-11-16 | newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The controversy over the Bogdanovs' work began on October 22, 2002, with an email sent by [[University of Tours]] physicist Max Niedermaier to [[University of Pittsburgh]] physicist [[Ezra T. Newman]].&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt;  Niedermaier suggested that the Bogdanovs' Ph.D. theses and papers were "spoof[s]," created by throwing together instances of theoretical-physics jargon, including terminology from [[string theory]]: "The abstracts are delightfully meaningless combinations of buzzwords ... which apparently have been taken seriously."&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newscientist" /&gt; Copies of the email reached American [[mathematical physicist]] [[John Baez]], and on October 23 he created a discussion thread about the Bogdanovs' work on the [[Usenet]] newsgroup ''sci.physics.research'', titled "Physics bitten by reverse Alan Sokal hoax?"&lt;ref name = "Baez web" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usenet"&gt;{{cite newsgroup | author=John Baez | title=Physics bitten by reverse Alan Sokal hoax? | date=2002-10-24 | newsgroup=sci.physics.research |message-id=ap7tq6$eme$1@glue.ucr.edu | url=https://groups.google.com/group/sci.physics.research/browse_frm/thread/28e04d38aabd16f2/09f8fde48d7c3566#09f8fde48d7c3566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baez was comparing the Bogdanovs' publications to the 1996 [[Sokal affair]], in which physicist [[Alan Sokal]] successfully submitted an intentionally nonsensical paper to a [[cultural studies]] journal in order to criticize that field's lax standards for discussing science. The Bogdanovs quickly became a popular discussion topic, with most respondents agreeing that the papers were flawed.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;  The story spread in public media, prompting Niedermaier to offer an apology to the Bogdanovs, admitting that he had not read the papers firsthand. The Bogdanovs' background in entertainment lent some plausibility to the idea that they were attempting a deliberate hoax, but Igor Bogdanov quickly denied the accusation.&lt;ref name="overbye" /&gt;&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;  The online discussion was quickly followed by media attention; ''[[The Register]]'' reported on the dispute on November 1, 2002&lt;ref name=register&gt;{{cite web|last=Orlowski|first=Andrew|title=Physics hoaxers discover Quantum Bogosity|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/11/01/physics_hoaxers_discover_quantum_bogosity/|website=[[The Register]]|author-link=Andrew Orlowski|date=2002-11-01|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and stories in ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'',&lt;ref name="chronicle" /&gt; ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'',&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt; ''The New York Times'', and other publications appeared soon after.&lt;ref name="le-monde"/&gt;&lt;ref name="die-zeit"/&gt;

==Reports and comments from scientists==

===Thesis readers===
One of the scientists who approved Igor Bogdanov's thesis, MIT's [[Roman Jackiw]], spoke to ''New York Times'' reporter Dennis Overbye.  Overbye wrote that Jackiw was intrigued by the thesis, although it contained many points he did not understand.  Jackiw defended the thesis:&lt;blockquote&gt;All these were ideas that could possibly make sense. It showed some originality and some familiarity with the jargon. That's all I ask.&lt;ref name="overbye"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast, Ignatios Antoniadis (of the [[École Polytechnique]]), who approved  Grichka Bogdanov's thesis, later reversed his judgment of it. Antoniadis told ''[[Le Monde]],''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I had given a favorable opinion for Grichka's defense, based on a rapid and indulgent reading of the thesis text. Alas, I was completely mistaken. The scientific language was just an appearance behind which hid incompetence and ignorance of even basic physics.&lt;ref name="le-monde"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Published papers===

In May 2001, the journal ''[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]]'' (CQG) reviewed an article authored by Igor and Grichka Bogdanov, titled "Topological theory of the initial singularity of spacetime". One of the referees' reports stated that the article was "Sound, original, and of interest. With revisions I expect the paper to be suitable for publication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | url = http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/bogdanoff/bogdanof3.pdf
 | accessdate = 2006-12-12|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was accepted by the journal seven months later.

However, after the publication of the article and the publicity surrounding the controversy, mathematician [[Greg Kuperberg]] posted to Usenet a statement written by Andrew Wray and Hermann Nicolai of the CQG editorial board. Originally sent via e-mail, the statement read, in part,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Regrettably, despite the best efforts, the refereeing process cannot be 100% effective. Thus the paper ... made it through the review process even though, in retrospect, it does not meet the standards expected of articles in this journal... The paper was discussed extensively at the annual Editorial Board meeting ... and there was general agreement that it should not have been published. Since then several steps have been taken to further improve the peer review process in order to improve the quality assessment on articles submitted to the journal and reduce the likelihood that this could happen again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup

The paper in question has, however, not been withdrawn by the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bogdanov|first=Grichka|last2=Bogdanov|first2=Igor|date=2001|title=Topological field theory of the initial singularity of spacetime*|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0264-9381/18/i=21/a=301|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|language=en|volume=18|issue=21|pages=4341|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/18/21/301|issn=0264-9381|bibcode=2001CQGra..18.4341B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the editor-in-chief of the journal issued a slightly different statement on behalf of the [[Institute of Physics]], which owns the journal, in which he insisted on the fact that their usual peer-review procedures had been followed, but no longer commented on the value of the paper. In particular the sentences "...it does not meet the standards expected of articles in this journal" and "The paper was discussed extensively at the annual Editorial Board meeting ... and there was general agreement that it should not have been published" were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2001, the ''[[Czechoslovak Journal of Physics]]'' accepted an article written by Igor Bogdanov, entitled "Topological Origin of Inertia". The referee's report concluded: "In my opinion the results of the paper can be considered as original ones. I recommend the paper for publication but in a revised form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | url = http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/bogdanoff/bogdanof2.pdf
 | accessdate = 2006-12-12|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, the ''[[Chinese Journal of Physics]]'' published Igor Bogdanov's "The [[KMS state]] of spacetime at the Planck scale". The report stated that "the viewpoint presented in this paper can be interesting as a possible approach of the Planck scale physics." Some corrections were requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Not all review evaluations were positive. [[Eli Hawkins]], acting as a referee on behalf of the ''[[Journal of Physics A]]'', suggested rejecting one of the Bogdanovs' papers: "It is difficult to describe what is wrong in Section 4, since almost nothing is right. [...] It would take up too much space to enumerate all the mistakes: indeed it is difficult to say where one error ends and the next begins. In conclusion, I would not recommend that this paper be published in this, or any, journal."&lt;ref name="hawkins"&gt;{{cite web

===Criticism of the papers===
[[Image:Le petit Parisien illustre 2nov1902.jpg|thumb|A [[Foucault pendulum]], "an icon of French science",&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt; illustrated in the magazine ''[[Le Petit Parisien]]'' (1902).]]
After the start of the Usenet discussion, most comments were critical of the Bogdanovs' work. For example, [[John C. Baez]] stated that the Bogdanov papers are  "a mishmash of superficially plausible sentences containing the right buzzwords in approximately the right order. There is no logic or cohesion in what they write."&lt;ref name = "Baez web"/&gt;  [[Jacques Distler]] voiced a similar opinion, proclaiming "The [Bogdanovs'] papers consist of buzzwords from various fields of mathematical physics, string theory and quantum gravity, strung together into syntactically correct, but semantically meaningless prose."&lt;ref name="distler-bogdanorama"&gt;{{cite web

Others compared the quality of the Bogdanov papers with that seen over a wider arena. "The Bogdanoffs' work is significantly more incoherent than just about anything else being published", wrote [[Peter Woit]]. He continued, "But the increasingly low standard of coherence in the whole field is what allowed them to think they were doing something sensible and to get it published."&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;  Woit later devoted a chapter of his book ''Not Even Wrong'' (2006) to the Bogdanov Affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pcJA3i0xKAUC |title=Not Even Wrong |author=Peter Woit |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-465-09275-8 |publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in the discussions were particularly unconvinced by a statement in the "Topological origin of inertia" paper that "whatever the orientation, the plane of oscillation of [[Foucault pendulum|Foucault's pendulum]] is necessarily aligned with the initial [[gravitational singularity|singularity]] marking the origin of physical space."  In addition, the paper claimed, the Foucault pendulum experiment "cannot be explained satisfactorily in either classical or relativistic mechanics".&lt;ref name = "Baez web"/&gt;  The physicists commenting on Usenet found these claims and subsequent attempts at their explanation peculiar,&lt;ref name = "Baez web"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baez-inertia"&gt;{{cite newsgroup

  | accessdate = 2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Baez and Russell Blackadar attempted to determine the meaning of the "plane of oscillation" statement; after the Bogdanovs issued some elaborations, Baez concluded that it was a complicated way of rephrasing the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the [[Big Bang|big bang]] [[Metric expansion of space|happened everywhere]], no matter which way a pendulum swings, the plane in which it swings can be said to "intersect the big bang".&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, Baez pointed out, this statement does not in fact concern the Big Bang, and is entirely equivalent to the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No matter which way a pendulum swings, there is some point on the plane in which it swings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Yet this rephrasing is itself equivalent to the statement &lt;blockquote&gt;Any plane contains a point.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  If ''this'' was the essence of the statement, Baez noted, it cannot be very useful in "explaining the origin of [[inertia]]".&lt;ref name="baez-inertia"/&gt;

[[Urs Schreiber]], then a [[postdoctoral researcher]] at the [[University of Hamburg]], noted that the mention of the Foucault pendulum was at odds with the papers' general tone, since they generally relied upon more "modern terminology".  (According to [[George Johnson (writer)|George Johnson]], the Foucault pendulum is "an icon of French science that would belong in any good Gallic spoof."&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt;)  Schreiber identified five central ideas in the Bogdanovs' work—"'result' A" through "'result' E"—which are expressed in the jargon of [[statistical mechanics]], [[topological quantum field theory|topological field theory]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. One bit of jargon, the [[Hagedorn temperature]], comes from [[string theory]], but as Schreiber notes, the paper does not use this concept in any detail; moreover, since the paper is manifestly not a string theory treatise, "considering the role the Hagedorn temperature plays in string cosmology, this is bordering on self-parody."  Schreiber concludes that the fourth "result" (that the spacetime [[Metric tensor|metric]] "at the initial singularity" must be [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]]) contradicts the initial assumption of their argument (an [[FRW cosmology]] with [[Pseudo-Riemannian manifold|''pseudo''-Riemannian metric]]). The fifth and last "result", Schreiber notes, is an attempt to resolve this contradiction by "invok[ing] quantum mechanics". The Bogdanovs themselves described Schreiber's summary as "very accurate"; for more on this point, see [[#Media involvement|below]]. Schreiber concluded,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Just to make sure: I do not think that any of the above is valid reasoning. I am writing this just to point out what I think are the central 'ideas' the authors had when writing their articles and how this led them to their conclusions.&lt;ref name="schreiber"&gt;{{cite web

Eli Hawkins of [[Pennsylvania State University]] voiced a similar concern about "The [[KMS state]] of spacetime at the Planck scale".

&lt;blockquote&gt;The main result of this paper is that this [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] should be a KMS state. This almost goes without saying; for a quantum system, the KMS condition is just the concrete definition of thermodynamic equilibrium. The hard part is identifying the quantum system to which the condition should be applied, which is not done in this paper.&lt;ref name="hawkins"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both Baez and, later, [[Peter Woit]] noted that content was largely repeated from one Bogdanov paper to another.&lt;ref name = "Baez web"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woit |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Woit |title=Not Even Wrong |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |year=2006 |isbn=9780465092758 |oclc=1035851234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hopf algebra.svg|250px|thumb| The defining conditions of a Hopf algebra can be expressed using a [[commutative diagram]].]]
Damien Calaque of the [[Louis Pasteur University]], [[Strasbourg]], commented negatively about Grichka Bogdanov's unpublished preprint "Construction of cocycle bicrossproducts by twisting". In Calaque's estimation, the results presented in the preprint did not have sufficient novelty and interest to merit an independent journal article, and moreover the principal theorem was, in its current formulation, false: Grichka's construction yields a [[bialgebra]] which is not necessarily a [[Hopf algebra]],&lt;ref name="calaque"&gt;{{cite web

Eventually, the controversy attracted mainstream media attention, opening new avenues for physicists' comments to be disseminated.  ''[[Le Monde]]'' quoted [[Alain Connes]], recipient of the 1982 [[Fields Medal]], as saying, "I didn't need long to convince myself that they're talking about things that they haven't mastered."&lt;ref name="le-monde"/&gt;  [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel laureate]] [[Georges Charpak]] stated on a French talk show that the Bogdanovs' presence in the scientific community was "nonexistent".&lt;ref&gt;[[France 2]] TV talk show, ''Tout le monde en parle'', June 12, 2004. See {{cite web|url=https://www.nouvelobs.com/rue89/rue89-nos-vies-connectees/20100930.RUE8748/quand-charpak-parlait-de-son-nobel-et-faisait-le-mariole.html |title=Quand Charpak parlait de son Nobel (et faisait le mariole) |last=Riché |first=Pascal |website=[[L'Obs]] |date=2010-09-30 |access-date=2018-11-21 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acrimed"/&gt;

The most positive comments about the papers themselves came from [[string theory|string theorist]] [[Luboš Motl]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...Some of the papers of the Bogdanoff brothers are really painful and clearly silly ... But the most famous paper about the solution of the initial singularity is a bit different; it is more sophisticated.

...it does not surprise me much that Roman Jackiw said that the paper satisfied everything he expects from an acceptable paper—the knowledge of the jargon and some degree of original ideas. (And be sure that Jackiw, Kounnas, and Majid were not the only ones with this kind of a conclusion.)

...Technically, their paper connects too many things. It would be too good if all these ideas and (correct) formulae were necessary for a justification of a working solution to the initial singularity problem. But if one accepts that the papers about these difficult questions don't have to be just a well-defined science but maybe also a bit of inspiring art, the brothers have done a pretty good job, I think. And I want to know the answers to many questions that are opened in their paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://motls.blogspot.com/2005/06/bogdanoff-papers.html "The Bogdanoff papers"] by Luboš Motl, ''The Reference Frame'' blog, June 16, 2005, accessed April 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Motl's measured support for ''Topological field theory of the initial singularity of spacetime'', however, stands in stark contrast to Robert Oeckl's official [[MathSciNet]] review, which states that the paper is "rife with nonsensical or meaningless statements and suffers from a serious lack of coherence," follows up with several examples to illustrate his point, and concludes that the paper "falls short of scientific standards and appears to have no meaningful content."&lt;ref name="oeckl"&gt;{{cite web | last=Oeckl | first=Robert | title=Review of 'Topological field theory of the initial singularity of spacetime' | publisher=[[MathSciNet]] | mr =1894907 |url=https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1894907}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official report from the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS), which became public in 2010, summarized the Bogdanovs' theses thusly: "''Ces thèses n’ont pas de valeur scientifique.

[...] Rarely have we seen a hollow work dressed with such sophistication''"'')''.''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sciences.blog.lemonde.fr/2010/10/16/les-jumeaux-bogdanov-etrilles-par-le-cnrs/|title=Les jumeaux Bogdanov étrillés par le CNRS|last=Parienté|first=Jonathan|date=2010-10-16|work=En quête de sciences|access-date=2018-02-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=[[Le Monde]]|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet discussions==

In addition to a few articles in print media, the Bogdanov Affair has been discussed extensively in various newsgroups, webpages and blogs; the Bogdanov brothers have often participated in the discussions, sometimes using pseudonyms or represented by friends acting as proxies.&lt;ref name="distler-bogdanorama"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acrimed"&gt;[http://www.acrimed.org/article1840.html Les frères Bogdanov, la science et les médias] ''Acrimed'' November 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; They have used these methods to defend their work and sometimes to insult their critics, among them the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize]] recipient [[Georges Charpak]].&lt;ref name="acrimed"/&gt;

In October 2002, the Bogdanovs released an email containing apparently supportive statements by [[Laurent Freidel]], then a visiting professor at the [[Perimeter Institute]].&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt;  Soon after, Freidel denied writing any such remarks, telling the press that he had forwarded a message containing that text to a friend. The Bogdanovs then attributed the quoted passages to Freidel, who said, "I'm very upset about that because I have received e-mail from people in the community asking me why I've defended the Bogdanov brothers. When your name is used without your consent, it's a violation."&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt;

At the start of the controversy in the moderated group ''sci.physics.research'', Igor Bogdanov denied that their published papers were a hoax,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup

''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[George Johnson (writer)|George Johnson]] described reading through the debate as "like watching someone trying to nail Jell-O to a wall", for the Bogdanovs had "developed their own private language, one that impinges on the vocabulary of science only at the edges."&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;Johnson, George.

===Spread of the dispute===

At the beginning of 2004, Igor Bogdanov began to post on French Usenet physics groups and Internet forums, continuing the pattern of behavior seen on ''sci.physics.research.''  A controversy began on the [[French Wikipedia]] when Igor Bogdanov and his supporters began to edit that encyclopedia's [[:fr:Igor et Grichka Bogdanoff|article on the brothers]], prompting the creation of a new article dedicated to the debate (''[[:fr:Polémique autour des travaux des frères Bogdanoff|Polémique autour des travaux des frères Bogdanov]]''—"Debate surrounding the work of the Bogdanov brothers"). The dispute then spread to the [[English Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Latrive | first=Florent |author2=Mauriac, Laurent | title=Dans les rouages de Wikipedia | work=Libération | pages=42–43 | date=2006-02-27 | url=http://www.liberation.fr/grand-angle/010140270-dans-les-rouages-de-wikipedia | accessdate=2006-07-16|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Lapirot | first=Olivier | title=Peut-on se fier à Wikipédia? | work=Micro Hebdo | pages=28 | date=2006-06-22 |url=http://www.01net.com/article/321982_a.html |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2005, this led the [[Arbitration Committee]], a [[dispute resolution]] panel that acts as the project's [[court of last resort]], to ban anyone deemed to be a participant in the external dispute from editing the English Wikipedia's article on the Bogdanov Affair.  A number of English Wikipedia users, including Igor Bogdanov himself, were explicitly named in this ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Regarding the Bogdanov Affair| url =http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Regarding_The_Bogdanov_Affair&amp;oldid=73602269| date = 2006-09-03| accessdate = 2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Baez wrote on his website that for some time the Bogdanovs and "a large crowd of [[sock puppet (internet)|sock puppets]]" had been attempting to rewrite the English Wikipedia article on the controversy "to make it less embarrassing to them". "Nobody seems to be fooled", he added.&lt;ref name = "Baez web"/&gt;

===Claims of pseudonymous activity===

The participation of an unidentified "Professor Yang" provoked additional confusion.&lt;ref name="distler-bogdanorama" /&gt;  Using an e-mail address at the domain ''th-phys.edu.hk'', an individual publishing under this name wrote to a number of individuals and on the Internet to defend the Bogdanov papers. This individual wrote to physicists John Baez, Jacques Distler and Peter Woit; to ''[[New York Times]]'' journalist Dennis Overbye; and on numerous physics blogs and forums, signing his name "''Professor L. Yang—Theoretical Physics Laboratory, International Institute of Mathematical Physics—HKU/Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong.''"  It is the [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] which is located in [[Clear Water Bay]], not [[Hong Kong University]] (HKU), whose main campus is located in the [[Mid-Levels]] of [[Hong Kong Island]].

The Bogdanovs have claimed several times that the "domain name 'th-phys.edu.hk' was officially owned by Hong Kong University."&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.fr/group/sci.physics.relativity/msg/5efe659e4869d961 "What before big bang?"] Google Groups, sci.physics.relativity, response to comment on September 10, 2004, accessed April 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was not confirmed officially by HKU and no Prof. Yang existed on the roster of the HKU physics department; nor did the university have an "International Institute of Mathematical Physics".&lt;ref name="Baez web"&gt;{{Cite web |last= Baez |first= John |authorlink= John Baez |date= 22 October 2010 |title= The Bogdanoff Affair |url= http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/bogdanov.html |website= Baez' review of the affair on his webpage at [[University of California, Riverside|math.ucr.edu]] |accessdate= 20 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspicions were consequently raised that Professor L. Yang was actually a pseudonym of the Bogdanovs.&lt;ref name="distler-bogdanorama"/&gt;  However, Igor Bogdanov has maintained that Professor Yang is a real mathematical physicist with expertise in [[KMS state|KMS theory]], a friend of his, and that he was posting anonymously from Igor's apartment.

Following this pattern, another academic domain name was also registered in [[Latvia]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060407175445/http://www.phys-maths.edu.lv/ phys-maths.edu.lv]), hosting the "Mathematical Center of Riemannian Cosmology". Again, this apparent educational institution was registered by Igor Bogdanov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Aftermath==
===''Rayons X'' and ''Avant Le Big Bang''===
In 2002, the Bogdanovs launched a new weekly TV show ''Rayons X'' (''[[X-ray|X Rays]]'') on French public channel [[France 2]]. In August 2004, they presented a 90-minute special cosmology program in which they introduced their theory among other cosmological scenarios. The French mainstream media, in both the press and on the Internet, covered the renewed controversy to some extent; media outlets that reported upon it include ''Acrimed''&lt;ref name="acrimed"/&gt; and ''Ciel et Espace.''&lt;ref name="fosse"&gt;{{cite news

[[Image:Golden Rectangle Construction.svg|thumb|The [[golden ratio]] φ, here shown as the long side of a [[golden rectangle]], is a solution to an [[algebraic equation]] and thus not a [[transcendental number]].]]
In 2004, the Bogdanovs published a commercially successful popular science book, ''Avant Le Big Bang'' (''Before the Big Bang''), based on a simplified version of their theses, where they also presented their point of view about the affair. Both the book and the Bogdanovs' television shows have been criticized for elementary scientific inaccuracies. Critics cite examples from ''Avant Le Big Bang'' including a statement that the "[[Golden ratio|golden number]]" [[Phi|φ]] (''phi'') is [[Transcendental number|transcendental]], an assumption that the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of a decreasing [[sequence]] is always zero, and that the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the Universe]] implies that the planets of the [[Solar System]] have grown farther apart.&lt;ref name="acrimed"/&gt;

In October 2004, a journalist from ''Ciel et Espace'' interviewed [[Shahn Majid]] of [[Queen Mary, University of London]] about his report on Grichka Bogdanov's thesis.  Majid said that the French version of his report on Grichka's thesis was "an unauthorized translation partially invented by the Bogdanovs." In one sentence, the English word "interesting" was translated as the French "''important''." A "draft [mathematical] construction" became "''la première construction [mathématique]''" ("the first [mathematical] construction"). Elsewhere, an added word demonstrated, according to Majid, that "Bogdanov does not understand his own draft results." Majid also described more than ten other modifications of meaning, each one biased towards "''surestimation outrancière''"—"outrageous over-estimation." Majid said that his original report described a "very weak" student who nevertheless demonstrated "an impressive amount of determination to obtain a doctorate."&lt;ref name="fosse"/&gt;  Later, Majid claimed in a Usenet post that, in an addendum to ''Avant Le Big Bang,'' Grichka intentionally misquoted Majid's opinion on the way this interview had been transcribed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.fr/group/fr.sci.physique/msg/3672cc092056a507?hl=en Usenet post by Shahn Majid], September 30, 2004, accessed April 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, in the same addendum, a critical analysis of their work made by [[Postdoctoral researcher|post-doc]] Urs Schreiber, and affirmed by the Bogdanovs as "very accurate", was included with the exception of the concluding remark "Just to make sure: I do not think that any of the above is valid reasoning", thus inverting the meaning from criticism into ostensible support.&lt;ref name="schreiber"/&gt;  Moreover, a comment by physicist Peter Woit written as, "It's certainly possible that you have some new worthwhile results on [[quantum group]]s", was translated as "''Il est tout à fait certain que vous avez obtenu des résultats nouveaux et utiles dans les groupes quantiques''" ("It is completely certain that you have obtained new and useful results on quantum groups") and published by the Bogdanovs in the addendum of their book.&lt;ref name="fosse"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/blog/archives/000034.html "Bogdanovs Redux"] by Peter Woit, from blog ''Not Even Wrong'', June 5th, 2004, accessed April 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuits===
In December 2004, the Bogdanovs sued ''Ciel et Espace'' for [[defamation]] over the publication of a critical article entitled "The Mystification of the Bogdanovs".&lt;ref name = "Baez web"/&gt;  In September 2006, the case was dismissed after the Bogdanovs missed court deadlines; they were ordered to pay 2500 [[euro]]s to the magazine's publisher to cover its legal costs.&lt;ref name="ciel-et-espace-judgment"&gt;{{cite news

{{anchor|Criminal prosecution of Alain Riazuelo}}
Alain Riazuelo, an [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] at the [[Institut d'astrophysique de Paris]], participated in many of the online discussions of the Bogdanovs' work. He posted an unpublished version of Grichka Bogdanov's PhD thesis on his personal website, along with his critical analysis. Bogdanov subsequently described this version as "dating from 1991 and too unfinished to be made public". Rather than suing Riazuelo for [[defamation]], Bogdanov filed a criminal complaint of [[copyright]] (''droit d'auteur'') violation against him in May 2011. The police detained and interrogated Riazuelo. He came to trial and was convicted in March 2012. The sentence was lenient: a fine of 2000 euros the court imposed was suspended, and only one euro of damages was awarded. But in passing judgement the court stated that the scientist had "lacked prudence", given "the fame of the plaintiff".&lt;ref name=Foucart2012&gt;{{cite news |last=Foucart |first=Stéphane |title=Les chercheurs et la menace Bogdanov (Researchers and the Bogdanov threat) |language=fr |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2012/04/20/les-chercheurs-et-la-menace-bogdanov_1688106_1650684.html |newspaper=[[Le Monde]] |date= 20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verdict outraged many scientists, who felt that the police and courts should have no say in a discussion of the scientific merits of a piece of work. In April 2012, a group of 170 scientists published an open letter titled ''L'affaire Bogdanoff: Liberté, Science et Justice, Des scientifiques revendiquent leur droit au blâme'' (''The Bogdanov Affair: Liberty, Science and Justice, scientists claim their right to blame'').&lt;ref name=NouvObsApril2012&gt;{{cite journal |title=Frères Bogdanov: 170 scientifiques réclament le droit de les critiquer (Bogdanov brothers: 170 scientists claim the right to criticize) |url=http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/2012/04/26/freres-bogdanov-170-scientifiques-reclament-le-droit-de-les-critiquer-231613 |journal=[[Le Nouvel Observateur]] |language=fr |date=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reflections upon the peer-review system==
During the heyday of this affair, some media coverage cast a negative light on theoretical physics, stating or at least strongly implying that it has become impossible to distinguish a valid paper from a hoax. Overbye's article in the ''[[New York Times]]'' voiced this opinion,&lt;ref name="overbye"/&gt; for example, as did Declan Butler's piece in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]].''&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; Posters on blogs and Usenet used the affair to criticize the present status of [[string theory]]; for the same reason, Woit devoted a chapter of ''[[Not Even Wrong (book)|Not Even Wrong]],'' a book emphatically critical of string theory, to the affair. On the other hand, George Johnson's report in ''The New York Times'' concludes that physicists have generally decided the papers are "probably just the result of fuzzy thinking, bad writing and journal referees more comfortable with correcting typos than challenging thoughts."&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt;  String theorist Aaron Bergman riposted in a review of ''Not Even Wrong'' that Woit's conclusion
&lt;blockquote&gt;is undermined by a number of important elisions in the telling of the story, the most important of which is that the writings of the Bogdanovs, to the extent that one can make sense of them, ''have almost nothing to do with string theory.'' ... I first learned of the relevant papers in a posting on the internet by Dr. John Baez. Having found a copy of one of the relevant papers available online, I posted that "the referee clearly didn't even glance at it."  While the papers were full of rather abstruse prose about a wide variety of technical areas, it was easy to identify outright nonsense in the areas about which I had some expertise. ... A pair of non-string theorists were able to get nonsensical papers generally not about string theory published in journals not generally used by string theorists. This is surely an indictment of something, but its relevance to string theory is marginal at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bergman, Aaron | date=2006-08-19 | url=http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/string/archives/000898.html | title=Review of ''Not Even Wrong'' | accessdate=2006-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jacques Distler]] mused that the tone of the media coverage had more to do with [[journalism ethics and standards|journalistic practices]] than with physics.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The much-anticipated New York Times article on the Bogdanov scandal has appeared. Alas, it suffers from the usual journalistic conceit that a proper newspaper article must cover a "controversy". There must be two sides to the controversy, and the reporter's job is to elicit quotes from both parties and present them side-by-side. Almost inevitably, this "balanced" approach sheds no light on the matter, and leaves the reader shaking his head, ''"There they go again..."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Distler, Jacques | date=2002-11-09 | url=http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000033.html | title=Half Full or Half Empty? | accessdate=2007-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many comments have been made on the possible shortcomings of the referral system for published articles, and also on the criteria for acceptance of a thesis and subsequent delivery of a Doctorate of Philosophy. [[Frank Wilczek]], who edited ''Annals of Physics'' (and is now a [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel laureate]]), told the press that the scandal motivated him to correct the journal's slipping standards, partly by assigning more reviewing duties to the editorial board.&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt;

Prior to the controversy, the reports on the Bogdanov theses and most of the journal referees' reports spoke favorably of their work, describing it as original and containing interesting ideas. This has been the basis of concerns raised about the efficacy of the [[Peer review|peer-review]] system that the scientific community and academia use to determine the merit of submitted manuscripts for publication; one concern is that over-worked and unpaid referees may not be able to thoroughly judge the value of a paper in the little time they can afford to spend on it. Regarding the Bogdanov publications, physicist [[Steve Carlip]] remarked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Referees are volunteers, who as a whole put in a great deal of work for no credit, no money, and little or no recognition, for the good of the community. Sometimes a referee makes a mistake. Sometimes two referees make mistakes at the same time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm a little surprised that anyone is surprised at this. Surely you've seen bad papers published in good journals before this! ... referees give opinions; the real peer review begins after a paper is published.&lt;ref name="carlip"&gt;{{cite newsgroup

Similarly, Richard Monastersky, writing in ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', observed, "There is one way...for physicists to measure the importance of the Bogdanovs' work. If researchers find merit in the twins' ideas, those thoughts will echo in the references of scientific papers for years to come."&lt;ref name="chronicle" /&gt;  Before the controversy over their work arose, the scientific community had shown practically no interest in the Bogdanovs' papers; indeed, according to [[State University of New York at Stony Brook|Stony Brook]] physics professor Jacobus Verbaarschot, who served on Igor Bogdanov's dissertation committee, without the hoax rumors "probably no one would have ever known about their articles."&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt;  {{As of|2018|October}}, the Bogdanovs' most recent paper was "Thermal Equilibrium and KMS Condition at the Planck Scale", which was submitted to the ''Chinese Annals of Mathematics'' in 2001 and appeared in 2003.&lt;ref name="bogdanov-spires" /&gt; That journal ceased publication in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscinet/cam |title=Chinese Annals of Mathematics |website=[[World Scientific]] |access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons with the Sokal affair==

Several sources have referred to the Bogdanov affair as a "reverse Sokal" hoax, drawing a comparison with the [[Sokal affair]], where the physicist [[Alan Sokal]] published a deliberately fraudulent and indeed nonsensical article in the humanities journal ''[[Social Text]].'' Sokal's original aim had been to test the effects of the intellectual trend he called, "for want of a better term, [[postmodernism]]". Worried by this "more-or-less explicit rejection of the rationalist tradition of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]", Sokal decided to perform an experiment which he later cheerfully admitted was both unorthodox and uncontrolled, provoking a maelstrom of reactions which, to his surprise, received coverage in ''[[Le Monde]]'' and even the front page of ''[[The New York Times]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Both Igor and Grichka Bogdanov have vigorously insisted upon the validity of their work, and possess academic degrees in the fields in which they are publishing, although the ''bona fides'' of their credentials are a bone of contention. In comparison, Alan Sokal was an outsider to the field in which he was publishing—a physicist, publishing in a humanities journal—and promptly issued a statement himself that his paper was a deliberate hoax; indeed, Sokal published the article to expose the weakness of the journal's editorial process. Replying on ''sci.physics.research'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup | title=Physics bitten by reverse Alan Sokal hoax? | author=Sokal, Alan | date=2002-10-31 | newsgroup=sci.physics.research |message-id=5b66478c.0210301401.84a7926@posting.google.com | url=https://groups.google.com/group/sci.physics.research/msg/a01affcdcc83e1e2 | accessdate=2006-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sokal referred readers to his follow-up essay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last=Sokal | first=Alan | authorlink=Alan Sokal | title=What the ''Social Text'' Affair Does and Does Not Prove | booktitle=A House Built on Sand: Exposing Postmodernist Myths about Science | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=1998-08-27 | isbn=0-19-511725-5 | url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/noretta.html | accessdate=2006-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he notes "the mere fact of publication of my parody" only proved that one particular journal's editors were "derelict in their intellectual duty". (According to ''The New York Times'', Sokal was "almost disappointed" that the Bogdanovs had not attempted a hoax after his own style. "What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander", he said.&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt;) Baez, who made a comparison between the two affairs, later retracted, saying that the brothers "have lost too much face for [withdrawing the work as a hoax] to be a plausible course of action".&lt;ref name = "Baez web"/&gt;

In a letter to ''The New York Times'', [[Cornell University|Cornell]] physics professor [[Paul Ginsparg]] writes that the contrast between the cases is plainly evident: "here, the authors were evidently aiming to be credentialed by the intellectual prestige of the discipline rather than trying to puncture any intellectual pretension."  He adds that the fact some journals and scientific institutions have low or variable standards is "hardly a revelation".&lt;ref name="ginsparg"&gt;Ginsparg, Paul.  "[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/12/opinion/l-is-it-art-is-not-a-question-for-physics-869198.html 'Is It Art?' Is Not a Question for Physics]".

The '''Cameron Prize of the University of Edinburgh''' is awarded to a person who has made any highly important and valuable addition to Practical Therapeutics{{clarify|date=November 2017}} in the previous five years. The prize, which may be awarded biennially, was founded in 1878 by the late Dr Andrew Robertson Cameron of Richmond, New South Wales, with a sum of £2,000. The University's ''[[Ancient university governance in Scotland#Senatus academicus|senatus academicus]]'' may require the prizewinner to deliver one or more lectures or to publish an account on the addition made to Practical Therapeutics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=1925|title=The Cameron Prize Lectures|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(01)69072-X|journal=Lancet|volume= 206| issue = 5332,|pages=979|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A list of recipients of the prize dates back to 1879.

Civil society can be understood as the "third sector" of society, distinct from government and business, and including the family and the private sphere.&lt;ref name=CSI&gt;[http://www.civilsoc.org/whatisCS.htm ''What is Civil Society''] civilsoc.org {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502111725/http://www.civilsoc.org/whatisCS.htm |date=2 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By other authors, "civil society" is used in the sense of 1) the aggregate of non-governmental organizations and institutions that manifest interests and will of citizens or 2) individuals and organizations in a society which are independent of the government.&lt;ref name=diccom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/civil+society?r=66|title=Civil society – Define Civil society at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term ''civil society'' is used in the more general sense of "the elements such as freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, etc, that make up a democratic society" (''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'').&lt;ref&gt;"Civil Society". ''[[Collins English Dictionary]] – Complete and Unabridged 11th Edition''. Retrieved 2 August 2012 from CollinsDictionary.com website: http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/civil-society&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the discussions among thinkers of Eastern and Central Europe, civil society is seen also as a normative concept of civic values.

==Etymology==
The term ''civil society'' goes back to [[Aristotle]]'s phrase ''koinōnía politikḗ'' (κοινωνία πολιτική), occurring in his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', where it refers to a ‘political community’, commensurate with the Greek [[city-state]] (''polis'') characterized by a shared set of norms and [[ethos]], in which free citizens on an equal footing lived under the [[rule of law]]. The ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' or end of civil society, thus defined, was [[eudaimonia]] (τὸ εὖ ζῆν ''tò eu zēn'') (often translated as human flourishing or common well-being), in as man was defined as a ‘political (social) animal’ (ζῷον πολιτικόν ''zōon politikón'').&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'', Bk. 1 passim, esp. 1252a1–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Jean L. Cohen,''Civil Society and Political Theory,'' MIT Press, 1994 pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Blumenfeld ''The Political Paul: Democracy and Kingship in Paul's Thought,'' Sheffield Academic Press, 2001 pp. 45–83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Davis,''The Politics of Philosophy: A Commentary on Aristotle's Politics,'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield 1996 pp. 15–32&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was used by Roman writers, such as [[Cicero]], where it referred to the ancient notion of a [[republic]] (''res publica''). It re-entered into Western political discourse following one of the late medieval translations of Aristotle’s ''Politics'' into Latin by [[Leonardo Bruni]] who as a first translated ''koinōnía politikḗ'' into ''societas civilis''. With the rise of a distinction between monarchical autonomy and public law, the term then gained currency to denote the corporate estates (''Ständestaat'') of a feudal elite of land-holders as opposed to the powers exercised by the prince.&lt;ref name="Cohen p.86"&gt;Jean L. Cohen,''Civil Society and Political Theory,'' MIT Press, 1994 p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; It had a long history in state theory, and was revived with particular force in recent times, in Eastern Europe, where dissidents such as [[Václav Havel]] as late as in 1990's employed it to denote the sphere of civic associations threatened by the intrusive holistic state-dominated regimes of Communist Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick W. Powell,''The Politics of Civil Society: Neoliberalism Or Social Left?,'' Policy Press, 2007. pp. 119–20, 148–49.&lt;/ref&gt; The first post-modern usage of civil society as denoting political opposition stems from writings of [[Aleksander Smolar]] in 1978-79.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However the term was not in use by [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] labor union in 1980-1981 and was popularized on a global scale by communist propaganda only in 1989 as a tool of legitimation of neoliberal transformation. &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Democracy==
The literature on relations between civil society and democratic [[state (polity)|political society]] have their roots in [[classical liberal]] writings of [[G.W.F. Hegel]] from whom they were adapted by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],&lt;ref name="zaleski" /&gt; [[Karl Marx]], and [[Ferdinand Tönnies]]. They were developed in significant ways by 20th century researchers [[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]], who identified the role of political culture in a democratic order as vital.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Almond, G., &amp; Verba, S.; 'The Civic Culture: Political Attitudes And Democracy In Five Nations; 1989; Sage&lt;/ref&gt;

They argued that the political element of political organizations facilitates better awareness and a more informed citizenry, who make better voting choices, participate in politics, and hold government more accountable as a result.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The statutes of these organizations have often been considered micro-constitutions because they accustom participants to the formalities of democratic decision making.

More recently, [[Robert D. Putnam]] has argued that even non-political organizations in civil society are vital for democracy. This is because they build [[social capital]], trust and shared values, which are transferred into the political sphere and help to hold society together, facilitating an understanding of the interconnectedness of society and interests within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Robert D. Putnam, Robert Leonardi, Raffaella Y. Nanetti | first = | authorlink = |author2=Robert Leonardi |author3=Raffaella Y. Nanetti  | title = Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1994 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-691-07889-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, however, have questioned how democratic civil society actually is. Some have noted that the civil society actors have now obtained a remarkable amount of political [[Power (philosophy)|power]] without anyone directly electing or appointing them.&lt;ref name="globall" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agnew, John; 2002; 'Democracy and Human Rights' in Johnston, R.J., Taylor, Peter J. and Watts, Michael J. (eds); 2002; ''Geographies of Global Change''; Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that civil society is biased towards the global north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccs.ukzn.ac.za/default.asp?3,28,11,1994|author=Pithouse, Richard |year=2005 |title=Report Back from the Third World Network Meeting Accra, 2005 |publisher=Centre for Civil Society : 1–6|work=ukzn.ac.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Partha Chatterjee (scholar)|Partha Chatterjee]] has argued that, in most of the world, "civil society is demographically limited."&lt;ref&gt;The Politics of the Governed: Popular Politics in Most of the World, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; For Jai Sen civil society is a neo-colonial project driven by [[global elite]]s in their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Engaging_Critically_with_the_Reality_and_Concept_of_Civil_Society |title=Engaging Critically with the Reality and Concept of Civil Society |last= |first= |date= |website=p2pfoundation.net |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, other scholars have argued that, since the concept of civil society is closely related to democracy and representation, it should in turn be linked with ideas of nationality and nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Graham.'Civil Society Theory and Euro-Nationalism' , Studies In Social &amp; Political Thought, Issue 4, March 2001, pp. 31–56&lt;/ref&gt; Latest analyses suggest that civil society is a neoliberal ideology legitimizing antidemocratic attack of economic elites on institutions of the welfare state through the development of the third sector as its substitute.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pawel Stefan Zaleski, ''Neoliberalizm i spoleczenstwo obywatelskie (Neoliberalism and Civil Society)'', Wydawnictwo UMK, Torun 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional economics==
[[Constitutional economics]] is a field of [[economics]] and [[constitutionalism]] which describes and analyzes the specific interrelationships between constitutional issues and functioning of the economy including [[budget process]]. The term "constitutional economics" was used by American economist [[James M. Buchanan]] as a name for a new [[budget]] planning and the latter's [[transparency in government|transparency]] to the civil society, are of the primary guiding importance to the implementation of the [[rule of law]]. Also, the availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in situations of unfair government spending and executive [[Impoundment of appropriated funds|impoundment]] of any previously authorized appropriations, becomes a key element for the success of any influential civil society.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova. "[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia, in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform]", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global==
[[File:Civil Brainbar (1).jpg|thumb|Civil lecture at Budapest Brainbar]]
Critics and activists currently often apply the term ''civil society'' to the domain of social life which needs to be protected against [[globalization]], and to the sources of resistance thereto, because it is seen as acting beyond boundaries and across different territories.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Michael; 1984; "The Autonomous Power of The State: Its Origins, Mechanisms and Results"; ''European Journal of Sociology'' 25: pp. 185–213&lt;/ref&gt; However, as civil society can, under many definitions, include and be funded and directed by those businesses and institutions (especially donors linked to European and Northern states) who support [[globalization]], this is a contested use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/partners/civil_society/home.htm|title=NGOs NGO civil society partnerships UN United Nations|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid development of civil society on the global scale after the fall of the communist system was a part of neo-liberal strategies linked to the [[Washington Consensus]].&lt;ref name="globall" /&gt; Some studies have also been published, which deal with unresolved issues regarding the use of the term in connection with the impact and conceptual power of the international aid system (see for example Tvedt 1998).

On the other hand, others see [[globalization]] as a social phenomenon expanding the sphere of [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] values, which inevitably led to a larger role for civil society at the expense of politically derived state institutions.

[http://esango.un.org/civilsociety/login.do The integrated Civil Society Organizations (iCSO) System], developed by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), facilitates interactions between civil society organizations and DESA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=http://vimeo.com/44625148|title=Basta! Rio+20 Walkout|work=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil Societies also have become involved in the environmental policy making process.  These groups impact the environmental policies by setting an agenda on fixing the harms done to the environment. They also get the public informed about environmental issues, which increases the public demand for environmental change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dodge|first1=Jennifer|title=Civil society organizations and deliberative policy making: interpreting environmental controversies in the deliberative system|journal=Policy Sciences|date=5 June 2014|volume=47|issue=2|pages=161–185|doi=10.1007/s11077-014-9200-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Republicanism sidebar}}
From a historical perspective, the actual meaning of the concept of civil society has changed twice from its original, classical form. The first change occurred after the French Revolution, the second during the fall of communism in Europe.

===Western antiquity===
The concept of civil society in its pre-modern [[classical republicanism|classical republican]] understanding is usually connected to the early-modern thought of [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century.  However, it has much older history in the realm of political thought. Generally, civil society has been referred to as a political association governing social conflict through the imposition of rules that restrain citizens from harming one another.&lt;ref name = "Ed6"&gt;Edwards 2004. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the classical period, the concept was used as a synonym for the good society, and seen as indistinguishable from the state. For instance, [[Socrates]] taught that conflicts within society should be resolved through public argument using ‘[[dialectic]]’, a form of rational dialogue to uncover truth. According to Socrates, public argument through ‘dialectic’ was imperative to ensure ‘civility’ in the polis and ‘good life’ of the people.&lt;ref name = "O'Connell"&gt;O'Connell 1999&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Plato]], the ideal state was a just society in which people dedicate themselves to the common good, practice civic virtues of wisdom, courage, moderation and justice, and perform the occupational role to which they were best suited. It was the duty of the ‘[[philosopher king]]’ to look after people in civility. [[Aristotle]] thought the polis was an ‘association of associations’ that enables citizens to share in the virtuous task of ruling and being ruled.&lt;ref name = "Ed6"/&gt; His ''koinonia politike'' as political [[community]].

The concept of ''societas civilis'' is Roman and was introduced by [[Cicero]]. The political discourse in the classical period, places importance on the idea of a ‘good society’ in ensuring peace and order among the people. The philosophers in the classical period did not make any distinction between the state and society. Rather they held that the state represented the civil form of society and ‘civility’ represented the requirement of good citizenship.&lt;ref name = "Ed6"/&gt; Moreover, they held that human beings are inherently rational so that they can collectively shape the nature of the society they belong to. In addition, human beings have the capacity to voluntarily gather for the common cause and maintain peace in society. By holding this view, we can say that classical political thinkers endorsed the genesis of civil society in its original sense.

The [[Middle Ages]] saw major changes in the topics discussed by political philosophers. Due to the unique political arrangements of [[feudalism]], the concept of classical civil society practically disappeared from mainstream discussion. Instead conversation was dominated by problems of [[Just War|just war]], a preoccupation that would last until the end of [[Renaissance]].

===Pre-modern history===
The [[Thirty Years' War]] and the subsequent [[Peace of Westphalia|Treaty of Westphalia]] heralded the birth of [[Westphalian sovereignty|the sovereign states system]]. The Treaty endorsed states as territorially-based political units having sovereignty. As a result, the monarchs were able to exert domestic control by emasculating the feudal lords and to stop relying on the latter for armed troops.&lt;ref name = "Bro70"&gt;Brown 2001:70{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henceforth, monarchs could form national armies and deploy a professional bureaucracy and fiscal departments, which enabled them to maintain direct control and supreme authority over their subjects. In order to meet administrative expenditures, monarchs controlled the economy. This gave birth to [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]].&lt;ref name = "Knut80"&gt;Knutsen 1997:80–118{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the mid-eighteenth century, absolutism was the hallmark of Europe.&lt;ref name = "Knut80"/&gt;

The absolutist concept of the state was disputed in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period.&lt;ref name = "Chand88"&gt;Chandhoke 1995:88{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a natural consequence of Renaissance, Humanism, and the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment thinkers raised fundamental questions such as "What legitimacy does heredity confer?", "Why are governments instituted?", "Why should some human beings have more basic rights than others?", and so on. These questions led them to make certain assumptions about the nature of the human mind, the sources of political and [[moral authority]], the reasons behind absolutism, and how to move beyond absolutism. The Enlightenment thinkers believed in the inherent goodness of the human mind. They opposed the alliance between the state and the Church as the enemy of human progress and well-being because the coercive apparatus of the state curbed individual liberty and the Church legitimated monarchs by positing the theory of divine origin. Therefore, both were deemed to be against the will of the people.

Strongly influenced by the atrocities of Thirty Years' War, the political philosophers of the time held that social relations should be ordered in a different way from [[natural law]] conditions. Some of their attempts led to the emergence of [[social contract]] theory that contested social relations existing in accordance with human nature. They held that human nature can be understood by analyzing objective realities and natural law conditions. Thus they endorsed that the nature of human beings should be encompassed by the contours of state and established [[positive law]]s. [[Thomas Hobbes]] underlined the need of a powerful state to maintain civility in society. For Hobbes, human beings are motivated by self-interests (Graham 1997:23). Moreover, these self-interests are often contradictory in nature. Therefore, in [[state of nature]], there was a condition of a war of all against all. In such a situation, life was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short" (Ibid: 25). Upon realizing the danger of anarchy, human beings became aware of the need of a mechanism to protect them. As far as Hobbes was concerned, rationality and self-interests persuaded human beings to combine in agreement, to surrender sovereignty to a common power (Kaviraj 2001:289).{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}} Hobbes called this common power, state, [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]].

[[John Locke]] had a similar concept to Hobbes about the political condition in England. It was the period of the Glorious Revolution, marked by the struggle between the divine right of the Crown and the political rights of Parliament. This influenced Locke to forge a social contract theory of a limited state and a powerful society. In Locke’s view, human beings led also an unpeaceful life in the state of nature. However, it could be maintained at the sub-optimal level in the absence of a sufficient system (Brown 2001:73). From that major concern, people gathered together to sign a contract and constituted a common public authority. Nevertheless, Locke held that the consolidation of political power can be turned into autocracy, if it is not brought under reliable restrictions (Kaviraj 2001:291). Therefore, Locke set forth two treaties on government with reciprocal obligations. In the first treaty, people submit themselves to the common public authority. This authority has the power to enact and maintain laws. The second treaty contains the limitations of authority, i. e., the state has no power to threaten the basic rights of human beings. As far as Locke was concerned, the basic rights of human beings are the preservation of life, liberty and property. Moreover, he held that the state must operate within the bounds of civil and natural laws.

Both Hobbes and Locke had set forth a system, in which peaceful coexistence among human beings could be ensured through social pacts or contracts. They considered civil society as a community that maintained civil life, the realm where civic virtues and rights were derived from natural laws. However, they did not hold that civil society was a separate realm from the state. Rather, they underlined the co-existence of the state and civil society. The systematic approaches of Hobbes and Locke (in their analysis of social relations) were largely influenced by the experiences in their period. Their attempts to explain human nature, natural laws, the social contract and the formation of government had challenged the divine right theory. In contrast to divine right, Hobbes and Locke claimed that humans can design their political order. This idea had a great impact on the thinkers in the Enlightenment period.

The Enlightenment thinkers argued that human beings are rational and can shape their destiny. Hence, no need of an absolute authority to control them. Both [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], a critic of civil society, and [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that people are peace lovers and that wars are the creation of absolute regimes (Burchill 2001:33). As far as Kant was concerned, this system was effective to guard against the domination of a single interest and check the tyranny of the majority (Alagappa 2004:30).

===Modern history===

{{Communitarianism sidebar}}

[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, G. W. F. (1821), [[Elements of the Philosophy of Right|''PR'']] [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prethica.htm#PR157 § 157]&lt;/ref&gt; completely changed the meaning of civil society, giving rise to a modern [[liberalism|liberal]] understanding of it as a form of [[free market|market]] society as opposed to institutions of modern [[nation state]].&lt;ref name="zaleski"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Zaleski | first = Pawel Stefan | authorlink =   | title = Tocqueville on Civilian Society. A Romantic Vision of the Dichotomic Structure of Social Reality  | journal = Archiv für Begriffsgeschichte  | volume = 50  | issue =   | pages =   | publisher = Felix Meiner Verlag  | location =   | year = 2008  | url =  http://zaleski.wex.pl/2008%20tocqueville%20on%20civilian%20society.pdf | doi =   | id =   | accessdate = }}
&lt;/ref&gt; While in [[classical republicanism]] civil society where synonymous with [[political society]], Hegel distinguished political state and civil society, what was followed by Tocqueville's distinction between civil and political societies and associations,&lt;ref name="zaleski" /&gt; repeated by Marx and Tönnies.

Unlike his predecessors, Hegel considered civil society ({{lang-de|bürgerliche Gesellschaft}}) as a separate realm, a "system of needs", that is the, "[stage of] difference which intervenes between the family and the state."&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, G. F. W., ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', edited by [[Allen W. Wood]] (Cambridge University Press, 1991), §184&lt;/ref&gt; Civil society is the realm of economic relationships as it exists in the modern industrial capitalist society,&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, Peter G. ''Hegel’s Civil Society: A Locus of Freedom'', appearing in Polity, Vol. 12, No. 4 (Summer 1980), pp. 622–46. p. 623&lt;/ref&gt; for it had emerged at the particular period of capitalism and served its interests: individual rights and private property.&lt;ref&gt;Dhanagare 2001:169{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, he used the German term "bürgerliche Gesellschaft" to denote civil society as "civilian society" – a sphere regulated by the [[civil code]]. This new way of thinking about civil society was followed by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] and [[Karl Marx]] as well.&lt;ref name="zaleski" /&gt; For Hegel, civil society manifested contradictory forces. Being the realm of capitalist interests, there is a possibility of conflicts and inequalities within it (ex: mental and physical aptitude, talents and financial circumstances). He argued that these inequalities influence the choices that members are able to make in relation to the type of work they will do. The diverse positions in Civil Society fall into three estates: the substantial estate (agriculture), the formal estate (trade and industry), and the universal estate (civil society).&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, G. F. W., ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', edited by Allen W. Wood (Cambridge University Press, 1991), §202&lt;/ref&gt; A man is able to choose his estate, though his choice is limited by the aforementioned inequalities. However, Hegel argues that these inequalities enable all estates in Civil Society to be filled, which leads to a more efficient system on the whole.

[[Karl Marx]] followed the Hegelian way of using the concept of civil society. For Marx, the emergence of the modern state created a realm of civil society that reduced society to private interests competing against each other. Political society was autonomised into the state, which was in turn ruled by the bourgeois class (consider also that suffrage only belonged, then, to propertied men). Marx, in his early writings, anticipated the abolition of the separation between state and civil society, and looked forward to the reunification of private and public/political realms (Colletti, 1975). Hence, Marx rejected the positive role of state put forth by Hegel. Marx argued that the state cannot be a neutral problem solver. Rather, he depicted the state as the defender of the interests of the bourgeoisie. He considered the state to be the executive arm of the bourgeoisie, which would wither away once the working class took democratic control of society.&lt;ref&gt;See [[V. I. Lenin]], ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'', (2010), for a summary of Marx's thought on the State and an introduction to Marxist thought on the state up until 1917. For a detailed discussion of Marx's thought on the state and civil society see Draper, 1977 &amp; 1986 (Volumes 1 and 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

The above view about civil society was criticised by [[Antonio Gramsci]] (Edwards 2004:10). Departing somewhat from Marx, Gramsci did not consider civil society as a realm of private and alienated relationships. Rather, Gramsci viewed civil society as the vehicle for bourgeois hegemony, when it just represents a particular class. He underlined the crucial role of civil society as the contributor of the cultural and ideological capital required for the survival of the hegemony of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg 1999:208&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than posing it as a problem, as in earlier Marxist conceptions, Gramsci viewed civil society as the site for problem-solving. Misunderstanding Gramsci, the [[New Left]] assigned civil society a key role in defending people against the state and the market and in asserting the democratic will to influence the state.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg 1999:30&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, neo-liberal thinkers consider civil society as a site for struggle to subvert Communist and authoritarian regimes.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg 1999:33&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the term civil society occupies an important place in the political discourses of the New Left and neo-liberals.

===Post-modern history===
[[File:Nemzeti Ünnep - Kossuth tér 1989.03.15 (6).jpg|thumb|The street is ours again - Budapest, 1989.03.15]]
It is commonly believed{{by whom|date=August 2018}} that the post-modern way of understanding civil society was first developed by political opposition in the former Soviet bloc East European countries in the 1980s. However, research shows that communist [[propaganda]] had the most important influence on the development and popularization of the idea instead, in an effort to legitimize [[neo-liberalism|neoliberal]] transformation in 1989.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to theory of restructurization of welfare systems, a new way of using the concept of civil society became a [[neo-liberalism|neoliberal]] [[ideology]] legitimizing development of the third sector as a substitute for the [[welfare state]].  The recent development of the third sector is a result of this welfare systems restructuring, rather than of democratization.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

From that time stems a political practice of using the idea of civil society instead of [[State (polity)|political society]]. Henceforth, postmodern usage of the idea of civil society became divided into two main ones: as political society and as the third sector – apart from plethora of definitions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The [[Washington Consensus]] of the 1990s, which involved conditioned loans by the World Bank and IMF to debt-laden developing states, also created pressures for states in poorer countries to shrink.&lt;ref name="globall" /&gt;  This in turn led to practical changes for civil society that went on to influence the theoretical debate.  Initially the new conditionality led to an even greater emphasis on "civil society" as a panacea, replacing the state's service provision and social care,&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Stefan Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making," IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006[http://zaleski.wex.pl/2006%20global%20nongovernmental%20administrative%20system.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Hulme and Edwards suggested that it was now seen as "the magic bullet."

By the end of the 1990s civil society was seen less as a panacea amid the growth of the [[anti-globalization movement]] and the transition of many countries to democracy; instead, civil society was increasingly called on to justify its legitimacy and democratic credentials. This led to the creation by the UN of a high level panel on civil society.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002044238/http://www.un.org/reform/civilsociety/bios.shtml |title=Reforming the United Nations |date=2 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the 1990s with the emergence of the nongovernmental organizations and the [[new social movements]] (NSMs) on a global scale, civil society as a [[Voluntary sector|third sector]] became treated as a key terrain of strategic action to construct ‘an alternative social and world order.’ Post-modern civil society theory has now largely returned to a more neutral stance, but with marked differences between the study of the phenomena in richer societies and writing on civil society in developing states.

==Link to the public sphere==
[[Jürgen Habermas]] said that the [[public sphere]] encourages rational will-formation; it is a sphere of rational and democratic social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, J. (1974). The public sphere: an encyclopaedia article. ''New German Critique'', 3, 49–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas argues that even though society was representative of capitalist society, there are some institutions that were part of political society. Transformations in economy brought transformations to the public sphere. Though these transformations happen, a civil society develops when it emerges as non-economic and has a populous aspect, and when the state is not represented by just one political party. There needs to be a locus of authority, and this is where society can begin to challenge authority. Jillian Schwedler points out that civil society emerges with the resurrection of the public sphere when individuals and groups begin to challenge boundaries of permissible behaviour – for example, by speaking out against the regime or demanding a government response to social needs – civil society begins to take shape.&lt;ref&gt;Schwedler, 1995:5{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 2017, social activist Himmat Bhandari in his lecture said at Civil Society, Rotary Club Bareilly,   
"Civilization need civilized societies, and civil societies need civilized citizens."

He was later that year elected to a citywide student leadership position as President of the Philadelphia Inter-Collegiate Black Student Union. His leadership grew nationally as he led the effort to organize the National Student Unity Conference and Congress, that hosted its inaugural conference of over 700 from across the nation from over 80 colleges and university at the University of Pennsylvania in 1986-87. The conference featured national 60 speakers spanning the ideological spectrum in black America, from Kwame Toure (formerly Stokely Carmichael) to  Ronald Reagan supporter, and Black conservative Robert L. Woodson. Both Jesse Jackson and Louis Farrakhan were keynote speakers. Jackson called the conference, "the most significant gathering of students since the founding of SNCC in 1960. The conference would take place in 1987-88 at Howard University in Washington DC and at Columbia University in New York City, in 1988–89.

In 1988 Tillard, would be invited to the White House to meet with President Ronald Reagan as the Student delegate of the Council for an Economic Agenda, a group of Black conservatives that included Woodson, then Harvard Economics professor Glen Lowery, New Jersey Minister Buster Soaries.

In 1995 Tillard, then known as Conrad Muhammad, the Nation of Islam's New York representative, and minister of the Nation of Islam in Harlem was a facilitator for a fundraiser to support Quibilah Shabazz (Malcolm X's Daughter). Quibilah had admitted to her involvement in a plot to kill Louis Farrakhan. The event was at the [[Apollo Theater]] in Harlem. The event was organized to address a 30-year rift between the Shabazz family and the Nation of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/06/nyregion/after-30-year-rift-farrakhan-s-meeting-with-dr-shabazz-stirs-hope.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, he was named the National Student Minister of the Nation of Islam and assigned to New York City and Harlem's Mosque Number Seven. In 1991, he was named Minister of the legendary Mosque, from that base he became a leading Minister in the nation, lecturing at over 100 colleges and universities, frequently representing the NOI at churches, meetings rally's and on radio and television. In 1993 he settled a rap war between A Tribe Called Quest and Wreckx-N-Effect. He provided tremendous diplomacy during the East Coast, West Coast rap wars during the 1990s.
       
In 1996 after the murder of rapper Tupac Shakur, Conrad who was at the time was known within the Nation of Islam as the 'Hip-hop minister', A Tribe Called Questorganized "Day of Atonement", to address issues of violent themes in hip-hop music. The Rappers summit invited key rappers. Its' goal was to initiate a truce a peace summit between East Coast-West Coast rap rivalry. Invited were Rap group [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Chuck D]] with [[Public Enemy (group)]], [[Kool Herc]],  [[Afrika Bambaataa]], model [[Bethann Hardison]], and actor [[Malik Yoba]].  Bad Boy Records president [[Sean Combs]], and his protege, rapper [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], so was rapper [[Tupac Shakur]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/rappers-pe aceThe Notorious B.I.G.-summit-article-1.748414&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 he studied at the Harvard Divinity School the theological writings of [[Howard Thurman]]. Thurman was an African-American theologian, civil rights advocate, author, philosopher, and educator.

In the 1990s he started (CHHCHANGE), A Movement for Change, was said to focus on “conscious hip hop activism", and social empowerment for black youth.&lt;ref name="villagevoice.com"/&gt; Conrad also hosted a popular radio talk show in the late 90s into the new millennium on New York City's African-American owned Inner-City Broadcasting, owned by one of his mentors Percy Ellis Sutton. He hosted New York Roundtable daily on WLIB and on the weekends Sunday Night Live on the networks flagship station WBLS.  

May 2001 -Conrad organized a hip-hop summit in Harlem at the [[Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building]] on 125th Street to address critical and negative issues with Hip-Hop and to find ways to clean up rap music. Music industry executives were invited such as; [[Elektra Records|Elektra]], [[Motown]], and rappers included was [[Fat Joe]] and [[Afrika Bambaata]].&lt;ref name="nypost.com"/&gt;

Conrad was outraged when he felt that Reverend Al Sharpton had taken his idea, and that Al Sharpton the leader of the National Action Network in Harlem along with David Mays of [[The Source]] magazine were to "use the moral cover of the civil rights movement", said to divert from criticizing that rap is not in good taste, and lacks decency. Taking the Rap an article written by Peter Noel for the Village Voice on January 9, 2001 stated that Conrad was infuriated that Sharpton and the other black leaders did not address Sean Combs or Shyne Barrows both who were at the time symbols of gangsta rap. Conrad stated that the Hip hop summits organized by Al Sharpton were shams. Combs, Barrow and Anthony "Wolf" Jones were about to go on trial in New York supreme court in Manhattan for a shooting at Club New York in New York City that took place in December 1999. Conrad is quoted as saying "I'm challenging the civil rights establishment, who essentially have become hired guns". Muhammad is also quoted as saying "Is the civil rights movement for rent, for sale, to the highest bidder?"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.villagevoice.com/2001/01/09/taking-the-rap-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russell Simmons]] did not support Conrad Muhammad's Hip-Hop summit. He organized a counter-summit hosted by Louis Farrakhan. Farrakhan who had ousted Conrad from Mosque No. 7 in Harlem.  Russell Simmons at the time was considered to be rap's premier mogul. Simmons was quoted as saying, “I urge that you do not support open and aggressive critics of the hip-hop community (i.e. C. Delores Tucker, Bob Dole or Conrad Muhammad)".

Conrad Muhammad is quoted as saying a ''New York Post'' article, “It is our community,” says Muhammad, “that is most hurting from the excesses of this music".  “Contemporary rap has brought back ‘pimp’ style,” Muhammad told The Post. “Contemporary rap has brought back ‘pimp’ style,” Muhammad told ''The Post''.   He was outspoken against the use of the "N word" and quoted as saying     
Second, he decries the ubiquitous use of the “N”-word in commercial rap.

“We have reinstitutionalized a word that the black community had fought to make persona non grata. Today, it is more popular than ever".&lt;ref name="nypost.com"/&gt;

In 2002, he ran for Congress, challenging veteran Democrat Congressman [[Charles Rangel]], predicting that Harlem was becoming unaffordable for its longtime residents.

Also in 2002, Conrad returned to his birth name Conrad Tillard. that same year, deeply influenced by Baptist theologian, Howard Thurman and several influential Christian ministers, including Bishop Frank M. Reid of the AME Church, Rev. William James, a legendary Harlem United Methodist Minister and Dr. Calvin o. Butts III, Tillard returned to Christianity.He is currently working on a book about his early life and ministry, his memoir, "In My Father's House: The Spiritual and Political Memoir of the Man Once Known as the Hip Hop Minister, Conrad Muhammad".  He says about his book,  "It was the golden age of Black Hip Hop. All the groups and things the youth like now I was right there in the middle of it and I can't wait to share my story through this book," said Rev. Tillard.&lt;ref name="amsterdamnews.com"/&gt;

Conrad co-wrote and hosted Culture Shock a one-hour television program for WPIX channel 11 in New York City. A program that addressed negative imagery in the media in youth programming. The program won various awards, the National Council on Family Relations First Place Media Award, Platinum Best “Show Award”,  and the “Aurora Award".&lt;ref name="imagesinternationalpr.com"/&gt;

In Bedford Stuyvesant, Conrad was a very socially and community-oriented Minister. As the Senior Minister, at The Nazarene Congregational United Church of Christ, he served on the Community Advisory Board, for the historic Boys and Girls High School. He funeralized police brutality victim Kiel Coppin, a Bedford Stuyvesant teenager with developmental issues, who was shot to death by police holding a hairbrush. He also worked to end violence among youth in the central Brooklyn, fair wages for NYC workers and in 2013 he made a spirited run for New York City Council in the 36th Council District. He was a key early clergy supporter of Barack Obama's historic 2009 campaign for president.

During his tenure at Nazarene, the pulpit featured nationally renown Ministers, politicians, civil rights leaders and cultural icons. Dick Gregory, Wynton Marsalis, Harvard Law School professor Charles Ogletree, NAACP President Ben Jealous, Howard University Divinity School Dean, Yolanda Pierce and journalist George Curry are some of the individuals who came to Nazarene, during Conrad's tenure. He constantly said to his members, "I want to expose my people to the best minds, I want the youth of Bedford Stuyvesant to see that they can be rappers, but they can also be anything they want to be, they can be the best"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34327">'''Constantin Gheorghe Banu''' (March 20, 1873 – September 8, 1940) was a [[Romania]]n writer, journalist and politician, who served as [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony (Romania)|Arts and Religious Affairs Minister]] in 1922–1923. He is remembered in literary history as the founder of ''[[Flacăra]]'' review, which he published in two editions, alongside [[Petre Locusteanu]], [[Ion Pillat]], [[Adrian Maniu]], and, later, [[Vintilă Russu-Șirianu]]. A best-selling magazine for its time, it functioned as a launching pad for several writers of the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist movement]].

Banu was an affiliate and orator of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], which he served continuously for 30 years, as a political journalist, public polemicist, and member of [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]]. His contribution as an essayist, lampoonist, and aphorist reflected his [[Progressivism|progressive]] approach to labor and productive life, his critique of conservatism, as well as his concept of civilized political mores.

Banu's career in politics reached the international level during World War I, when he took refuge from [[Romania in World War I|German-occupied Romania]] to campaign for the Romanian cause in Paris. Subsequently, during his term as minister, he focused on negotiating a Romanian [[Concordat]] and normalizing relations with the Catholic Church. In his final years in politics, he was an affiliate of the [[National Liberal Party-Brătianu]]. These activities, like much of his vast (but fragmentary) work in print, or his speeches, endured as the focus of political controversy.

==Biography==
===Early years and political debut===
Born in [[Bucharest]], his father was a Gheorghe N. Banu, and his mother a Smaranda (or Coralia) Banu. He was French on his mother's side,&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1967), p. 380; Stavinschi, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; but his exact lineage is unclear. According to Banu himself, his French grandmother led a mysterious life in Bucharest and died at ''Așezămintele Brâncovenești'' Hospital in September 1848. Her husband was a [[Greeks in Romania|Greek-Romanian]] known as Koronidy, who may have been a shipbuilder or a schoolteacher from a shipbuilding family.&lt;ref name="stav18"&gt;Stavinschi, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; On his father's side, Banu was probably descending from a clan of Romanian shepherds.&lt;ref name="ni(67)380"&gt;Iorga (1967), p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather or great-grandfather was reportedly a ''[[Starosta|Staroste]]'' of the furriers' guild in [[Galați]].&lt;ref name="stav18"/&gt;

Baptized [[Romanian Orthodox]],&lt;ref&gt;Rusu Abrudeanu (1930), p. 557&lt;/ref&gt; Banu completed secondary education at [[Saint Sava National College]], a classmate of writer [[Ioan A. Bassarabescu]], actor [[Ion Livescu]], and lawyer-politician [[Scarlat Orăscu]]. Influenced by their teacher, classical scholar [[Anghel Demetriescu]], they formed their own literary club, which held its meetings in the Saint Sava basement, putting out the [[Polygraph (duplicating device)|polygraphed]] magazine ''Armonia'', then the bi-monthly ''Studentul Român''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ion Livescu]], ''Amintiri și scrieri despre teatru'', pp. 7, 299–300. Bucharest: [[Editura pentru literatură]], 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Banu was also in a mathematics class taught by Ștefan Popescu. By his own recollection, he was a struggling student, and had much trouble learning [[trigonometry]] from the textbook of [[Spiru Haret]]—his future political mentor and employer.&lt;ref&gt;Banu, pp. 169–171&lt;/ref&gt;

Banu graduated from the literature and philosophy faculty of the [[University of Bucharest]] in 1895, and from the law faculty in 1900.&lt;ref name="stav18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carte"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.agentiadecarte.ro/2012/03/«rotonda-13-constantin-banu-si-revista-flacara»-la-mnlr/ «Rotonda 13: Constantin Banu şi Revista Flacăra», la MNLR], Agenția de Carte&lt;/ref&gt; As he himself noted in 1936: "Although not a literary professional, I always had a soft spot for literature."&lt;ref name="mșev3"&gt;Mihail Șerban, "Cu d. Const. Banu, evocând trecutul. După 25 de ani dela apariția revistei ''Flacăra'', fostul ei director ne vorbește despre începuturi, colaboratori și drumul parcurs", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', June 27, 1928, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He also had an enduring passion for history, as noted by his professor [[Nicolae Iorga]], who recommended him for a teacher's chair.&lt;ref name="ni(67)380"/&gt; During a stint as a novice teacher in [[Brăila]], he had his "second encounter" with Haret, who, as [[Ministry of Education and Scientific Research (Romania)|Education Minister]], was personally inspecting the local schools. He equated listening to Haret's speech as a personal revelation about the sheer force of one's creative energies.&lt;ref&gt;Banu, pp. 171–175&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Bucharest, Banu began working as a history professor at [[Matei Basarab National College (Bucharest)|Matei Basarab High School]] in 1898,&lt;ref name="stav18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carte"/&gt; part of a teaching staff which came to include [[Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu]], [[Emanoil Grigorovitza]], [[Theodor Speranția]], [[Alexandru Toma]], and [[Eugen Lovinescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; One of his students was the poet [[George Topîrceanu]].&lt;ref name="stav18"/&gt; Banu later transferred to the Nifon Mitropolitul Seminary.&lt;ref name="stav18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carte"/&gt; In this environment, he founded a literary-and-theatrical society, with contributions from pupil [[Petre Locusteanu]], who later became his friend and close associate.&lt;ref name="mșev3"/&gt; His debut in letters came in 1900, with a brochure criticizing the textbook author Serafim Ionescu and the teaching of [[Romanian history]].&lt;ref name="stav19"&gt;Stavinschi, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Banu also took up work as a promoter of public literacy, joining [[Ioan Kalinderu]] and [[Barbu Știrbey]]'s Steaua Association, which had as its object "the strengthening of education among regular folk through moral, patriotic and useful publications".&lt;ref&gt;"«Steaua»", in ''Albina. Revistă Enciclopedică Populară'', Nr. 51/1901, p. 1976; "«Steaua»", in ''Albina. Revistă Enciclopedică Populară'', Nr. 22/1915, p. 839&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, Banu's former professor, folklorist [[G. Dem. Teodorescu]], died. Attending his funeral, Banu gave a rousing speech exhorting the values of [[work ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Petre Haneș]], "Figuri de dascăli. II: Teodorescu. Gh. Dem.", in ''Preocupări Literare'', Nr. 1/1942, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; His political articles that appeared in ''Secolul XX'' starting in 1899, as well as his oratorical talent, drew the attention of Haret's own National Liberal Party (PNL).&lt;ref name="carte"/&gt; Around 1903, he was a functionary in the upper echelons of Education Ministry, Chief Inspector of the Private Schools under Minister Haret,&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 170; Stavinschi, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; in which capacity he first met and encouraged the novelist (and aspiring politician) [[Mihail Sadoveanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/centenarul_debutului_sadovenian "Centenarul debutului sadovenian"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 41/2004&lt;/ref&gt; Upon moving to Bucharest, he took over a villa on Parfumului Street, where he lived with his wife Aneta (or Ioana). She came from a [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar]] family of [[Western Moldavia]], and owned an estate at [[Hălăucești]].&lt;ref name="stav19"/&gt; Their two sons, Nicolae and Ioan, were respectively born in 1907 and 1908.&lt;ref name="stav19"/&gt;

As noted by memoirist [[Constantin Kirițescu]], Banu quit the education system when his job became "a nuisance, a hindrance to his rise."&lt;ref name="stav21"&gt;Stavinschi, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Working for the liberal press, he was editor-in-chief of ''[[Voința Națională]]'' from 1903 and director of ''[[Viitorul]]'' from 1907,&lt;ref name="carte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stav19"/&gt; part of a team that also comprised [[Ion G. Duca]] and [[Henric Streitman]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Podoleanu, ''60 scriitori români de origină evreească'', Vol. II, p. 311. Bucharest: Bibliografia, Bucharest, [1935].  {{OCLC|40106291}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''Voința Națională'', Banu inaugurated a literary supplement, which put out ''[[feuilleton]]s'' by Sadoveanu, [[Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești]], [[Ilarie Chendi]], [[Nicolae Gane]], and [[Ion Bentoiu]].&lt;ref name="mșev3"/&gt; Under his auspices, ''Voința Națională'' also featured commentary on literature, theater and painting.&lt;ref name="carte"/&gt; Under the pen name Teofil, he wrote the column ''Una-alta'' ("This and That") in a literary style, focusing on politics, but also outlining his belief in the [[Didacticism|didactic value of art]].&lt;ref name="carte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mșev3"/&gt; It was also at this paper that he resumed his close collaboration with Locusteanu.&lt;ref name="carte"/&gt;

===''Flacăra'' creation===
Meanwhile, Banu's radical politics collided with the agenda of the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]] and its [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]], [[Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino]]. During the [[1907 Romanian peasants' revolt|peasants' revolt of early 1907]], Iorga and Banu's Bucharest homes were searched by police, who confiscated "a great number of letters and important papers."&lt;ref&gt;"Ultima oră. Nuoi perchezițiunĭ", in ''Opinia'', April 8, 1907, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In his late years, Banu still recalled the impression left on him by the revolt, "this free-riding daughter of Nature": "I have seen pillars of fire roaming the villages, setting train stations alight, and crackling among the ruins."&lt;ref name="mșev3"/&gt; In the [[Romanian general election, 1907|election of May]], running on PNL lists in [[Ialomița County]],&lt;ref name="stav20"&gt;Stavinschi, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Banu took a seat in the [[Romanian Chamber of Deputies|Assembly of Deputies]]. He was its Secretary from 1907 to 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 720; Stavinschi, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Banu impressed his audience, including the Conservative adversary [[Alexandru Marghiloman]], with his oratorical skill.&lt;ref&gt;Stavinschi, pp. 19, 20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, he was among the jurors who condemned to prison Gheorghe Stoenescu-Jelea, the would-be assassin of Prime Minister [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantin Bacalbașa]], ''Bucureștii de altă dată'', Vol. III, p. 256. Bucharest: [[Universul]], 1936&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the Conservatives' return to power, he failed to win a seat in the 2nd College [[Ilfov County]] in the [[Romanian general election, 1911|February 1911 election]], running on a coalition anti-Conservative list headed by [[Nicolae Fleva]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantin Bacalbașa]], ''Bucureștii de altă dată'', Vol. IV, pp. 12–14. Bucharest: [[Universul]], 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 1911,&lt;ref&gt;Baiculescu ''et al.'', p. 245; Călinescu, p. 713; Desa ''et al.'', p. 348; Stavinschi, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Banu and Locusteanu printed the first issue of ''[[Flacăra]]'', a weekly literature and current events magazine. When asked what motivated him to launch his own magazine, Banu referred to his literary passion, and also noted that the magazine (or "literary newspaper") was "of some use to my [liberal] party"—"Duca understood this from the very start, and so he was happy to inaugurate the magazine with an article of his own".&lt;ref name="mșev3"/&gt; The name, literally "Flame", was chosen in oblique reference to the "pillars of fire" of 1907. These, Banu argued, could be turned into constructive fires of "purification".&lt;ref name="mșev3"/&gt;

With its "people's agenda",&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; ''Flacăra'' had unparalleled success among the urban middle classes, particularly with its exposure of literary scandals,&lt;ref name="gc713"&gt;Călinescu, p. 713&lt;/ref&gt; but was poorly received by literary professionals. Once criticized for its alleged eclecticism and lack of aesthetic discernment, the magazine became involved in polemics, mainly written by Banu,&lt;ref name="carte"/&gt; who also personally interviewed his featured writers.&lt;ref name="gc713"/&gt; ''Flacăra'' had a regular circulation of 15,000,&lt;ref name="mșev3"/&gt; peaking at 30,000,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 96–97; Peltz, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; which was unusually high for the demographic and literacy standards of the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. This was largely because of Locusteanu's contribution in publicity,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 96–976&lt;/ref&gt; but also, according to Banu, to the talents featured in its pages. Also according to Banu, the magazine owed its survival to Locusteanu and, secondly, to [[Spiru Hasnaș]].&lt;ref name="mșev3"/&gt;

The magazine set out as a mainstream review, hosting established talents such as [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] and [[Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea]]; its most nonconformist contributors were "moderate" [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolists]]: [[Ion Minulescu]], [[Caton Theodorian]], and [[Victor Eftimiu]],&lt;ref name="gc713"/&gt; later joined by [[Barbu Nemțeanu]],&lt;ref name="pc107–8"&gt;Cernat, pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes by [[Nicolae Budurescu]], [[Alexandru Dominic]], and [[Eugen Titeanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Peltz, pp. 102, 190, 204&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Banu's own writings appeared in ''Flacăra''; these included poems, aphorisms and literary, cultural and political articles. He also signed his work as Glaucon and Mefisto, and sometimes used Al. Șerban, Const. Paul and Cronicarul Dâmboviței, pen names he shared with Locusteanu.&lt;ref name="carte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stav19"/&gt; His journalistic work, also carried in [[George Diamandy]]'s ''Revista Democrației Române'',&lt;ref&gt;Baiculescu ''et al.'', p. 532&lt;/ref&gt; sought to express political objectivity and sincerity. Some of his socially themed texts, conceived as sketches or little scenes, denounced parasitism, lack of patriotism, arrogance and aggressive stupidity; his ideology veered toward sympathy and a sense of duty toward the productive classes.&lt;ref name="carte"/&gt; According to literary historian [[George Călinescu]], such works are without stylistic value: "C. Banu shows up in his aphorisms as a grieving but trite [[Francesco Guicciardini|Guicciardini]], of no humanistic worth".&lt;ref name="gc713"/&gt;

At the time of their publishing, Banu's texts were derided by a rival modernist, [[Tudor Arghezi]],  who, by one estimate, wrote half of his lampoons entirely against Banu or ''Flacăra''.&lt;ref name="stav20"/&gt; In Arghezi's magazine ''[[Facla]]'', Banu and Locusteanu were viewed as "triumphant mediocrities" and "[[street organ]]s", on the same artistic level as [[Radu D. Rosetti]] and [[Maica Smara]].&lt;ref&gt;Remus Zăstroiu, "Elemente de critică literară în periodicele socialiste dintre 1900 și 1916", in ''Anuar de Lingvistică și Istorie Literară'', Vol. 18, 1967, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, with [[Ion Pillat]] and [[Adrian Maniu]] as caretakers of the literary pages, ''Flacăra'' also turned to more radical forms of modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 713; Cernat, pp. 23, 32, 54, 61, 188&lt;/ref&gt; Pillat, Maniu, and [[Horia Furtună]] also "conspired" to relaunch here the disgraced Symbolist mentor, [[Alexandru Macedonski]], serializing his novel ''[[Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu|Thalassa]]''; and helped launch the career of [[George Bacovia]], publishing his plaquette ''[[Plumb (Bacovia)|Plumb]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tudor Vianu]], ''Scriitori români'', Vol. III, [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1971, pp. 353, 383. {{OCLC|7431692}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolist [[N. Davidescu]] took over as the literary reviewer, pushing an aesthetic ideal that was inspired by readings from [[Remy de Gourmont]];&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; the other staff reviewer was Hasnaș who, Călinescu notes, merely wrote "earnestly".&lt;ref name="gc713"/&gt; The magazine also published illustration by, among others, the debuting avant-garde draftsman, [[Marcel Janco]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
In the years before World War I, returned to the Assembly, Banu debated major national issues with the Conservative Party doctrinaires. Responding to [[Constantin C. Arion]]'s call for national unity after the [[Balkan Wars]], he argued that such internal peace could never be achieved with "an aggrieved peasantry as the basis of our State". A [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]], he contended, could even make Romania into a great regional power.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian-Dragoș Bunghez, "Parlamentul și politica externă a României în ajunul Primului Război Mondial (februarie-iunie 1914)", in ''Cercetări Istorice'', Vol. 33, 2014, pp. 197–198&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Banu was also critical of the populist currents undermining the PNL, and thus picked sides against Iorga and his [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalists]]. His ''Flacăra'' articles, Iorga noted at the time, supported anti-nationalist causes such as [[Jewish emancipation]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Iorga]], ''Acțiunea militară a României. În Bulgaria cu ostașii noștri'', p. 19. Bucharest: [[Editura Socec]], 1914&lt;/ref&gt; while his parliamentary speeches expressed worries against the rise of Romania's insurrectionist "[[Boulangisme]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Iorga]], ''Oameni cari au fost'', Vol. II, p. 332. Bucharest: [[Editura Fundațiilor Regale]], 1935&lt;/ref&gt; Banu hoped to appease Conservatives who viewed land reform as proof of socialism, contending that "increasing property" was the best method to curb left-wing agitation and promote "social conservation". He also campaigned for [[election reform]], insisting that it could solve the "periodic convulsions" in Romanian society, and criticizing the Conservatives' electoral ideal as a [[Potemkin village]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae Copoiu, "...acest vulcan care fierbe surd", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', September 1973, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plaque Comité unité roumaine, 22 avenue de l'Opéra, Paris 1.jpg|thumb|210px|Plaque honoring the 1917–1918 National Committee for Romanian Unity, at the former ''Hôtel des deux mondes'', [[Avenue de l'Opéra]], Paris. Banu credited as one of three ''La Roumanie'' editors]]
By 1914, Banu was also writing for the ''Flacăra'' satellite ''Semnalul'', for the PNL paper ''Democrația'', and for the literary bimonthly ''Văpaia''.&lt;ref&gt;Baiculescu ''et al.'', pp. 178, 613, 694&lt;/ref&gt; In July, days after the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Sarajevo assassination]], Banu was selected on a panel of deputies, headed by [[Mihail G. Orleanu]], which proposed democratic reforms to the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|1866 constitution]]. Other members included Iorga, [[Constantin Stere]], [[Nicolae Romanescu]], and [[Vintilă Brătianu]].&lt;ref&gt;"Comisiunile de studii ale Constituantei", in ''Gazeta Ilustrată'', Nr. 30/1914, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Romania kept neutral during the first two years of war, but an intellectual battle divided Romanian society, between "[[Francophilia|Francophiles]]", who supported the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]], and "[[Germanophilia|Germanophiles]]", who looked to the [[Central Powers]]. Banu and the National Liberals leaned toward the Entente Francophiles. In October 1914, he directed a rally of university students who vandalized the offices of ''Ziua'', a Germanophile daily put out by [[Ioan Slavici]], and chanted threats against [[Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino]], owner of the Germanophile ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Carmen Patricia Reneti, "Relații româno-germane în anul 1914", in ''Revista de Istorie Militară'', Nr. 1–2/2010, pp. 36, 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Although, as historian [[Lucian Boia]] writes, it remained "without jarring partisanship",&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; ''Flacăra''{{'}}s Ententist-and-populist tinges were ridiculed and parodied in ''[[Chemarea]]'', the radical-left Symbolist review put out by [[Ion Vinea]].&lt;ref name="pc107–8"/&gt; Banu's 1916 book ''Sub mască'' ("Under the Mask"), signed Mefisto, included poems initially published in ''Flacăra''{{'}}s ''Gazeta rimată'' column. Their subjects received varying treatment, with tones that ranged from humor and pamphleteering jokes to invective;&lt;ref name="carte"/&gt; Banu himself acknowledged that such pieces were "sometimes mean and often unfair".&lt;ref name="mșev3"/&gt; As critics note, his critical virulence and moralizing intent were balanced by a certain literary talent, itself subsumed by the categorical nature of polemic.&lt;ref name="carte"/&gt; Also published that year, the brochure ''Trăiască viaţa!…'' ("Long Live Life!…") is a collection of articles, some of them distinctly autobiographical.&lt;ref name="carte"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stavinschi, pp. 18, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Honoring its [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|secret commitment to the Entente]], Romania entered the war in August 1916. ''Flacăra'' closed down with a final issue on November 13 of that year,&lt;ref&gt;Baiculescu ''et al.'', p. 245; Desa ''et al.'', p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; as Bucharest prepared for [[Battle of Bucharest|the German siege]]. Banu later escaped to Paris, where, from January 1918, he joined the directorial staff of ''La Roumanie'' journal (with [[Emil Fagure]] and [[Constantin Mille]]), campaigning in French for the cause of [[Greater Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'', pp. 829–830; Rusu Abrudeanu (1921), pp. 442–443&lt;/ref&gt; He intervened directly to obtain statements of solidarity with beleaguered Romania from [[Ernest Lavisse]], [[Lucien Poincaré]], and other French academics, while trying in vain to prevent the Romanian government from negotiating a [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|separate peace with the Central Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;Rusu Abrudeanu (1921), pp. 446–450&lt;/ref&gt;

With the turn of tides, Banu formed part of the Romanian delegation to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919, attending as co-director of ''La Roumanie''.&lt;ref name="carte"/&gt; Reelected to the Assembly [[Romanian general election, 1919|in November 1919]], he made overtures toward Iorga and the Democratic Nationalists in power, moderating his party's attacks against them.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1930), p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1920, when the anti-PNL coalition was toppled by [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]], Iorga proposed that Banu and [[Matei B. Cantacuzino]] form a technocratic government of national reconciliation; the monarch preferred a cabinet headed by [[Alexandru Averescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1930), pp. 362–364&lt;/ref&gt; Banu put out two more editions of ''Flacăra'' between December 10, 1921 and June 1923, with [[Vintilă Russu-Șirianu]] as his second, contributions from old regulars such as Minulescu and Macedonski,&lt;ref name="gc713"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Desa et al., p. 209"&gt;Desa ''et al.'', p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; and food chronicles by [[Păstorel Teodoreanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Florina Pîrjol, "Destinul unui formator de gusturi. De la savoarea 'pastilei' gastronomice la gustul fad al compromisului", in ''Transilvania'', Nr. 12/2011, pp. 19, 25&lt;/ref&gt; Banu who wrote regularly for ''[[Cuget Românesc]]'' monthly during that interval,&lt;ref name="Desa et al., p. 209"/&gt; had no say in ''Flacăra''{{'}}s management, which went to Pillat, Furtună, and then Minulescu. Despite their "great efforts", he noted, the magazine failed commercially—"such were the times."&lt;ref name="gc713"/&gt;

===Ministerial office and later life===
Still in the Assembly following the [[Romanian general election, 1922|1922 election]], Banu served as [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony (Romania)|Arts and Religious Affairs Minister]] under Prime Minister Brătianu, from 1922 to 1923. During that time, he involved himself in negotiating a [[Concordat]], in the hope of normalizing [[Holy See–Romania relations|relations with the Holy See]]. The [[1923 Constitution of Romania|1923 constitution]] gave special recognition to the Orthodox and [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek Catholic Church]], but Banu satisfied the former when he stripped state representatives of their right to elect bishops.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1939), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; According to memoirist and PNL man [[Ion Rusu Abrudeanu]], he erred in keeping by his side the Greek Catholic functionary [[Zenovie Pâclișanu]], who stood accused of undermining the PNL and of leaking the Concordat draft to the Catholic press in [[Transylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Rusu Abrudeanu, pp. 557, 562–563, 565–568&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Pâclișanu also sabotaged Banu's investigation into allegations of church art smuggling by Catholic clergymen who migrated to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Rusu Abrudeanu (1930), pp. 564–565&lt;/ref&gt;

Banu's accomplishments as minister include his successful promotion of [[Intellectual property in Romania|Romania's first copyright law]], on January 15, 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cassian Maria Spiridon]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/TATAapr8.html "Secolul breslei scriitoricești"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded an Inspectorate of Romanian Museums, under [[Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș]], but withheld its financing later on.&lt;ref&gt;Tzigara-Samurcaș, pp. 165–166&lt;/ref&gt; The two politicians negotiated for a reciprocal exchange of coveted cultural goods between, on one hand, Romania and, on the other, [[Weimar Germany]] and the [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian Republic]]. They only managed to obtain the [[Cucuteni Treasure]] from Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Tzigara-Samurcaș, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1923, Banu was noted for his opposition to the new PNL establishment, whose most prominent figure was [[Vintilă Brătianu]]; unlike his colleagues, he did not believe in the goal of "crushing" the opposition, at the time led by the [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1939), pp. 102, 106&lt;/ref&gt; Resigning from the Ministry in November, to be replaced by [[Alexandru Lapedatu]],&lt;ref&gt;"Noul ministru al artelor", in ''Ilustrația Săptămânală'', Nr. 2/1923, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Banu still served in the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]],&lt;ref name="carte"/&gt; but largely withdrew from public life. His articles and musings were being still published in ''[[Adevărul]]'', ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', and ''Cele Trei Crișuri''.&lt;ref name="carte"/&gt; In 1927, celebrating the golden jubilee of [[Romanian War of Independence|Romanian Independence]] with conferences at the [[Romanian Athenaeum|Bucharest Atheneum]], Banu outlined his liberal critique of the conservative ethos, turning against "reactionary" cultural figures such as Caragiale, [[Mihail Eminescu]], and the ''[[Junimea]]'' circle.&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, pp. 151–154&lt;/ref&gt; Such themes were also explored in his lectures, recorded by [[Radio Romania]] in 1929 and 1933.&lt;ref name="stav21"/&gt; As Caragiale scholar [[Șerban Cioculescu]] noted at the time, Banu's "effete phraseology" and "cliche vocabulary" encased his resentments against conservative intellectuals, who had exposed and satirized the "characteristics of practical liberalism".&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, pp. 153–154&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1927 and 1930, the PNL polarized into competing factions: one led by Vintilă Brătianu and the other, the "Georgists", by [[Gheorghe Brătianu]]. Banu was on the side of the former, and also expressed his faction's sympathy for King [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]], who had returned from exile to reclaim his throne.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ioan Lupaș]], "Între «Vintiliști» și «Gheorghiști»", in ''[[Țara Noastră]]'', Nr. 10/1930, p. 945&lt;/ref&gt; By December 1933, with Vintilă dead and Duca, his one-time colleague at ''Viitorul'', in charge of the party, Banu had embraced Georgism and defected to the PNL's seceded wing, the "[[National Liberal Party-Brătianu]]". He and [[Artur Văitoianu]] were the most notorious PNL assets to follow Gheorghe Brătianu on this venture.&lt;ref&gt;Vasile Netea, ''Memorii''. Târgu Mureș: Editura Nico, 2010, p. 204.  {{ISBN|978-606-546-049-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move was also a sign of Banu's opposition to the politically ambitious Carol II: Banu, Brătianu, and [[Constantin C. Giurescu]] were working on a proclamation against Carol, his ''[[camarilla]]'', and Duca, the acting PNL Prime Minister. A year later, after Duca's unexpected assassination by the [[Iron Guard]], a [[National Peasants' Party]] administration intervened to stop Banu, Brătianu, [[P. P. Negulescu]] and others from coordinating massive opposition rallies.&lt;ref&gt;Petre Țurlea, "România sub stăpânirea Camarilei Regale (1930–1940) (III)", in ''Analele Universității Creștine Dimitrie Cantemir. Seria Istorie'', Vol. 2, Issues 1–2, pp. 172–173, 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; The Iron Guard also took notice, and Banu's name appeared on an enemies' list, alongside those of [[Aristide Blank]], [[Alexandru C. Constantinescu]], [[Wilhelm Filderman]], and [[Gheorghe Gh. Mârzescu]].&lt;ref name="stav21"/&gt;

According to Kirițescu, Banu reached the "forefront of politics", but failed to preserve his position—overall, he lacked "the faculty which allows one to wiggle through, to engage in transactions".&lt;ref name="stav21"/&gt; Banu's final book appeared in 1937 as ''Grădina lui Glaucon sau Manualul bunului politician'' ("[[Glaucon]]'s Garden or A Textbook for Good Politicians"). Here, he uses his political and artistic experience to analyze his peers in 757 sections (aphorisms, words of advice and morality sketches). Through these, he shows his ethical leanings, irony, and skepticism, formulating concise general judgments.&lt;ref name="carte"/&gt;

Banu spent his final years away from the capital, at his wife's home in [[Hălăucești]].&lt;ref name="stav19"/&gt; He died in 1940 at a hospital in [[Roman, Romania|Roman]],&lt;ref name="ni(67)380"/&gt; and was buried in Plot 21 of [[Bellu Cemetery]], Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, ''Necropola Capitalei'', p. 63. Bucharest: [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History]], 1972&lt;/ref&gt; His former mentor and adversary Iorga paid homage to him with an obituary in ''[[Neamul Românesc]]'', emphasizing that Banu, the "unusual figure" among his peers, belonged to an older era of "dignity and decency, when people were held up by talent and merit".&lt;ref name="ni(67)380"/&gt; Banu's oratory was of "great formal restraint, unjarring."&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1967), p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;

Aneta Guțulescu-Banu survived her husband for decades, dying in 1970.&lt;ref name="stav19"/&gt; Their first-born Nicolae "Bob", who lived to 1985, was married to the actress Lucia, a member of the [[Rosetti family]] and niece of the composer [[George Enescu]]. Ioan, his brother, died in 2001. Constantin and Aneta's other child was a daughter, Ana-Irina "Nazica", who married the engineer Nicolae Cristofor.&lt;ref name="stav19"/&gt; The villa built by the Banus' on Parfumului Street was [[Nationalization in Romania|nationalized]] by the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], and assigned to an army institution. In 1987, at the height of the [[Ceaușima]] campaign, it was demolished.&lt;ref name="stav19"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17604">A '''course evaluation''' is a paper or electronic [[questionnaire]], which requires a written or selected response answer to a series of questions in order to evaluate the instruction of a given [[Course (education)|course]].  The term may also refer to the completed survey form or a summary of responses to questionnaires.

They are a means to produce feedback which the teacher and school can use to assess their quality of instruction. The process of (a) gathering information about the impact of learning and of teaching practice on student learning, (b) analyzing and interpreting this information, and (c) responding to and acting on the results, is valuable for several reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Rahman, K. (2006). Learning from your business lectures: using [[stepwise regression]] to understand course evaluation data. ''Journal of American Academy of Business, Cambridge'', 19(2), 272–279.&lt;/ref&gt; They enable instructors to review how others interpret their teaching methods. The information can be also used by administrators, along with other input, to make summative decisions (e.g., decisions about promotion, tenure, salary increases, etc.) and make formative recommendations (e.g., identify areas where a faculty member needs to improve).&lt;ref name=DuneganHrivnak2003&gt;Dunegan, K. J., &amp; Hrivnak, M. W. (2003). Characteristics of mindless teaching evaluations and the moderating effects of image compatibility. ''Journal of Management Education'', 27(3), 280–303.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, these evaluations are combined with peer evaluations, supervisor evaluations, and results of student’s test scores to create an overall picture of teaching performance.  Course evaluations are implemented in one of two ways, either [[Summative assessment|summative]] or [[Formative assessment|formative]].

==Course evaluation instruments==
Course evaluation instruments generally include variables such as communication skills, organizational skills, enthusiasm, flexibility, attitude toward the student, teacher – student interaction, encouragement of the student, knowledge of the subject, clarity of presentation, course difficulty, fairness of grading and exams, and global student rating.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, C., Damewood, E., &amp; Hodge, N. (2000). Professor attitude: its effect on teaching evaluations. ''Journal of Management Education'', 24(4), 458–473.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tang, T. L.-P. (1997). Teaching evaluation at a public institution of higher education: factors related to the overall teaching effectiveness. ''Public Personnel Management'', 26(3), 379–391.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summative evaluation==
{{main|Summative assessment}}
Summative evaluation occurs at the end of a semester, usually a week or two before the last day of class. The evaluation is performed by the current students of the class. Students have the option to reflect on the teachers’ instruction without fear of punishment because course evaluations are completely confidential and anonymous. This can be done in one of two ways; either with a paper form or with online technology. Typically, in a paper based format, the paper form is distributed by a student while the teacher is out of the room. It is then sealed in an envelope and the teacher will not see it until after final grades are submitted. The online version can be identical to a paper version or more detailed, using branching question technology to glean more information from the student. Both ways allow the student to be able to provide feedback. This feedback is to be used by teachers to assess the quality of their instruction. The information can also be used to evaluate the overall effectiveness of a teacher, particularly for tenure and promotion decisions.&lt;ref name=Mohanty2005&gt;Mohanty, G., Gretes, J., Flowers, C., Algozzine, B., &amp; Spooner, F. (2005). Multi-method evaluation of instruction in engineering classes. ''Journal of Personnel Evaluation in Education'', 18(2), 139–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formative evaluation==
{{main|Formative assessment}}
Formative evaluation typically occurs when changes can take place during the current semester, although many institutions consider written comments on how to improve formative as well. Typically this form of evaluation is performed by peer consultation. Other experienced teachers will review one of their peer’s instructions.  The purpose of this evaluation is for the teacher to receive constructive criticism on teaching. Generally, peer teachers will sit in on a few lessons given by the teacher and take notes on their methods. Later on the team of peer teachers will meet with the said teacher and provide useful, non-threatening feedback on their lessons. The peer team will offer suggestions on improvement, which the said teacher can choose to implement.

[[Peer feedback]] is given to the instructor typically in the form of an open session meeting. The peers first reflect on the qualities that were good in the instruction. Then they move on to areas that need improvement. Next the instructor will make suggestions for improvement and receive feedback on those ideas.

Student feedback can be an important part of formative evaluation. Student evaluations are formative when their purpose is to help faculty members improve and enhance their teaching skills.&lt;ref name=Mohanty2005/&gt; The teachers may require their students to complete written evaluation, participate in ongoing dialogue or directed discussions during the course of the semester. The use of a 'Stop, Start Continue' format for student feedback has been shown to be highly effective at generating constructive feedback for course improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Hoon, A.E., Oliver, E., Szpakowska, K., and Newton P.M. 2014. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02602938.2014.956282#.VDj5IFfbGw2 Use of the ‘Stop, Start, Continue’ method is associated with the production of constructive qualitative feedback by students in higher education]. ''Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education''. DOI:10.1080/02602938.2014.956282&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Faculty of Psychology of the [[University of Vienna]], [[Twitter]] was used for formative course evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Stieger, S., &amp; Burger, C. (2010). Let's go formative: continuous student ratings with Web 2.0 application Twitter. ''Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking'', 13(2), 163–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of course evaluations as measures of teaching effectiveness==
Summative student evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been widely criticized, especially by teachers, for not being accurate measures of teaching effectiveness.&lt;ref name=DuneganHrivnak2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emery, C. R., Kramer, T. R., &amp; Tian, R.G. (2003).

Scott Armstrong | journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Surveys have shown that a majority of teachers believe that a teacher's raising the level of standards and/or content would result in worse SETs for the teacher, and that students in filling out SETs are biased in favor of certain teachers' personalities, looks, disabilities, gender and ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;Birnbaum, M. H. (1999).

[http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/faculty2.rtf Longer version with references.] Retrieved 2011-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  The evidence that some of these critics cite indicates that factors other than effective teaching are more predictive of favorable ratings. In order to get favorable ratings, teachers are likely to present the content which can be understood by the slowest student. Consequently, the content has been affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=3459 |title=Natural Learning in Higher Education |author=J.

Some have suggested that using them for such purposes leads to the [[dumbing down]] of educational standards.  Others have said that the typical way SETs are now used at most universities is demeaning to instructors&lt;ref&gt;Gray, M., &amp; Bergmann, B. R. (September–October 2003).

The economics of education literature and the economic education literature is especially critical.  For example, Weinberg ''et al.'' (2009) finds SET scores in first-year economics courses at Ohio State University are positively related to the grades instructors assign but are unrelated to learning outcomes once grades are controlled for.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, B. A., Hashimoto, M., &amp; Fleisher, B. M. (2009). Evaluating teaching in higher education. ''Journal of Economic Education'', 40(3), 227–261.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have also found a positive relationship between grades and SET scores but unlike Weinberg ''et al.'' (2009) do not directly address the relationship between SET scores and learning outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, M. A., Jewell, R. T., &amp; Kim, M. (2009). What determines student evaluation scores?

''Economics of Education Review'', 27(4), 417–428.&lt;/ref&gt;  A paper by Krautmann and Sander (1999) find that the grades students expect to receive in a course are positively related to SET scores.&lt;ref&gt;Krautmann, A. C., &amp; Sander, W. (1999). Grades and student evaluations of teachers. ''Economics of Education Review'', 18(1), 59–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Isely and Singh (2005) find it is the difference between the grades students expect to receive and their cumulative GPA that is the relevant variable for obtaining favourable course evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;Isely, P., &amp; Singh, H. (2005). Do higher grades lead to favorable student evaluations? ''Journal of Economic Education'', 36(1), 29–42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another paper by Carrell and West (2010) use a data set from the U.S. Air Force Academy where students are randomly assigned to course sections (reducing selection problems).&lt;ref name=CarrellWest2010&gt;Carrell, S.

Scott Armstrong | journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hamermesh and West (2005) find that students at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] gave attractive instructors higher SET scores than less attractive instructors.&lt;ref&gt;Hamermesh, D. S., &amp; Parker, A. (2005). Beauty in the classroom: instructors’ pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity. ''Economics of Education Review'', 24(4), 369–376.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the authors conclude that it may not be possible to determine if attractiveness increases the effectiveness of an instructor, possibly resulting in better learning outcomes.  It may be the case that students pay more attention to attractive instructors. Meanwhile, a 2017 lawsuit was filed on grounds of xenophobic discrimination in course evaluations at the [[University of Kansas]], with Peter F. Lake, the director of [[Stetson University]]'s Center for Excellence in Higher Education Law and Policy, suggesting this is no isolated incident.&lt;ref name="chroniclewhenstudentsprejudicestaint"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schmidt|first1=Peter|title=When Students’ Prejudices Taint Reviews of Instructors|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/When-Students-Prejudices/238892?key=u3dI3dQRSKsxDuUp14YxCRflItw9ugwSJcqkheIXQyDUs1bamST4Y6n2yK2gXap2LWU0WEw1ODRXZDFZT1JLM21sSndQSENzTjN5eVplNWY0ZlFPakFmakNTMA|accessdate=January 13, 2017|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The empirical economics literature is in sharp contrast to the educational psychology literature which generally argues that teaching evaluations are a legitimate method of evaluating instructors and are unrelated to [[grade inflation]].  However, similar to the economic literature other researchers outside of educational psychology have offered negative findings on course evaluations.  For example, some papers have examined online course evaluations and found them to be heavily influenced by the instructor’s attractiveness and willingness to give high grades in return for very little work.&lt;ref&gt;Felton, J., Mitchell, J., &amp; Stinson, M. (2004a). Web-based student evaluations of professors: the relations between perceived quality, easiness and sexiness. ''Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education'', 29(1), 91–108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Felton, J., Mitchell, J., &amp; Stinson, M. (2004b). [http://www.abe.sju.edu/proc2004/felton2.pdf Cultural differences in student evaluations of professors.] ''Journal of the Academy of Business Education'', Proceedings. Retrieved 2011-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of these assessment instruments is that largely the data they produce are difficult to interpret for purposes of self- or course-improvement, given the number of variables that can affect evaluation scores.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, P. (2012). [http://cjsdw.com/index.php/cjsdw/article/view/16/8 Silent Partners: student course evaluations and the construction of pedagogical worlds] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140119070734/http://cjsdw.com/index.php/cjsdw/article/view/16/8 |date=2014-01-19 }}. ''Canadian Journal for Studies in Discourse and Writing'', 24(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, paper based course evaluations can cost a university thousands of dollars over the years, while an electronic survey is offered at minimal cost to the university.

Another concern that has been raised by instructors is that response rates to online course evaluations are lower (and therefore the results may be less valid) than paper-based in class evaluations.  The situation is more complex that response rates alone would indicate.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J., Brown, G., &amp; Spaeth, S. (Aug/Sept 2006).

'''Diver training''' is the set of processes through which a person learns the necessary and desirable skills to safely [[Underwater diving|dive underwater]] within the scope of the [[training standard]] relevant to the specific training programme. Most diver training follows procedures and schedules laid down in the associated training standard, in a formal training programme, and includes relevant [[foundational knowledge]] of the underlying theory, including some basic [[physics]], [[physiology]] and [[Diving environment|environmental information]], practical skills training in the selection and safe use of the associated [[diving equipment|equipment]] in the specified underwater environment, and [[Test (assessment)|assessment]] of the required skills and knowledge deemed necessary by the [[Diver certification agency|certification agency]] to allow the newly certified diver to dive within the specified range of conditions at an acceptable level of [[risk]]. [[Recognition of prior learning]] is allowed in some training standards.

Diver training is closely associated with diver certification or registration, the process of application for and issue of formal recognition of competence by a certification agency or registration authority.

Work skills specific to the underwater environment may be included in diver trailing programmes, but are also often provided independently, either as job training for a specific operation, or as generic training by specialists in the fields.

==Prerequisites==
{{see also|Fitness to dive}}
The entry requirements for diver training depend on the specific training involved, but generally include medical fitness to dive.

'''Fitness to dive''', (also '''medical fitness to dive'''), is the medical and physical suitability of a [[Underwater diving|diver]] to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater [[diving equipment]] and procedures. Depending on the circumstances it may be established by a signed statement by the diver that he or she does not suffer from any of the listed disqualifying conditions and is able to manage the ordinary physical requirements of diving, to a detailed medical examination by a physician registered as a [[Diving medicine#Education and registration of practitioners|medical examiner of divers]] following a procedural checklist, and a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner.

The most important medical is the one before starting diving, as the diver can be screened to prevent exposure when a dangerous condition exists. Other important medicals are after some significant illness where medical intervention is needed. This has to be done by a doctor who is competent in diving medicine, and can not be done by prescriptive rules.&lt;ref name="Fitness 2001" /&gt;

[[Psychology|Psychological]] factors can affect fitness to dive, particularly where they affect response to emergencies, or risk taking behaviour. The use of medical and recreational drugs, can also influence fitness to dive, both for physiological and behavioural reasons. In some cases prescription drug use may have a net positive effect, when effectively treating an underlying condition, but frequently the side effects of effective medication may have undesirable influences on the fitness of  diver, and most cases of recreational drug use result in an impaired fitness to dive, and a significantly increased risk of sub-optimal response to emergencies.

Formal educational prerequisites are variable. Diving skills are largely physical, but for professional diving a measure of literacy and numeracy is necessary to allow a reasonable chance of success with the theoretical knowledge requirements, and for effective on-site communication within the dive team. The international ''lingua franca'' of offshore diving operations is English.

Some training standards include an ability to swim as a prerequisite.&lt;ref name="Class IV DTS" /&gt;

Diving theory is the basic knowledge of the physical and physiological effects of the underwater environment on the diver.

'''Diving physics''' are the aspects of [[physics]] which directly affect the [[Underwater diving|underwater diver]] and  which explain the effects that divers and their equipment are subject to underwater which differ from the normal human experience out of water. These effects are mostly consequences of immersion in water, the hydrostatic pressure of depth and the effects of the pressure on breathing gases. An understanding of the physics is useful when considering the physiological effects of diving and the [[List of diving hazards and precautions|hazards and risks of diving]].

'''Diving physiology''' is the [[Physiology|physiological]] influences of the underwater environment on the physiology of air-breathing animals, and the adaptations to operating underwater, both during [[breath-hold diving|breath-hold dives]] and while breathing at ambient pressure from a suitable breathing gas supply.  It, therefore, includes both the physiology of breath-hold diving in humans and other air-breathing animals, and the range of physiological effects generally limited to human ambient pressure divers either freediving or using [[underwater breathing apparatus]]. Several factors influence the diver, including immersion, exposure to the water, the limitations of breath-hold endurance, variations in ambient pressure, the effects of breathing gases at raised ambient pressure, effects caused by the use of breathing apparatus, and sensory impairment. All of these may affect diver performance and safety.&lt;ref name="usn" /&gt;

Immersion affects fluid balance, circulation and work of breathing.&lt;ref name="Pendergast and Lundgren 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kollias et al 1976" /&gt; Exposure to cold water can result in the harmful cold shock response,&lt;ref name="phases" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coldii" /&gt; the helpful diving reflex and excessive loss of body heat.&lt;ref name="Physiology and Pathophysiology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Panneton 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sterba" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cheung" /&gt; Breath-hold duration is limited by oxygen reserves, and the risk of hypoxic blackout, which has a high associated risk of drowning.&lt;ref name="Pearn et al 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shallow1968" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dan" /&gt;

Large or sudden changes in ambient pressure have the potential for injury known as barotrauma.&lt;ref name="usn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brubakk" /&gt; Breathing under pressure involves several effects. Metabolically inactive gases are absorbed by the tissues and may have narcotic or other undesirable effects, and must be released slowly to avoid the formation of bubbles during decompression.&lt;ref name="Bauer1970" /&gt; Metabolically active gases have a greater effect in proportion to their concentration, which is proportional to their partial pressure, which for contaminants is increased in proportion to absolute ambient pressure.&lt;ref name="usn" /&gt;

Work of breathing is increased by increased density and viscosity of the breathing gas, artifacts of the breathing apparatus, and hydrostatic pressure variations due to posture in the water. The underwater environment also affects sensory input, which can impact on safety and the ability to function effectively at depth.&lt;ref name="Pendergast and Lundgren 2009" /&gt;

[[File:Leszek Czarnecki wyprawa na Atol Bikini 2006.JPG|thumb|Scuba diver decompressing at a planned stop during ascent from a dive]]

'''Decompression theory''' is the study and modelling of the transfer of the [[inert gas]] component of [[breathing gas]]es from the gas in the lungs to the tissues and back during exposure to variations in ambient pressure. In the case of underwater diving, this mostly involves ambient pressures greater than the local surface pressure,&lt;ref name="USNDM R6" /&gt; but astronauts, high altitude mountaineers, and travellers in aircraft which are not pressurised to sea level pressure,&lt;ref name="Van Liew and Conkin 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt; are generally exposed to ambient pressures less than standard sea level atmospheric pressure. In all cases, the [[Decompression sickness|symptoms caused by decompression]] occur during or within a relatively short period of minutes to hours, or occasionally days, after a significant pressure reduction.&lt;ref name="USNDM R6" /&gt; The term "decompression" derives from the reduction in [[ambient pressure]] experienced by the organism and refers to both the reduction in [[pressure]] and the process of allowing dissolved inert gases to be eliminated from the [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s during and after this reduction in pressure. The uptake of gas by the tissues is in the dissolved state, and elimination also requires the gas to be dissolved, however a sufficient reduction in ambient pressure may cause bubble formation in the tissues, which can lead to tissue damage and the symptoms known as decompression sickness, and also delays the elimination of the gas.&lt;ref name="USNDM R6" /&gt;

Decompression modeling attempts to explain and predict the mechanism of gas elimination and bubble formation within the organism during and after changes in ambient pressure,&lt;ref name="Gorman" /&gt; and provides mathematical models which attempt to predict acceptably low risk and reasonably practicable procedures for decompression in the field.&lt;ref name="Wienke" /&gt; Both deterministic and probabilistic models have been used, and are still in use.

[[File:Decompression chamber.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Photograph of the cramped interior of a cylinder containing two benches and two diver trainees|A [[recompression chamber]] is used to treat some diving disorders, and for training divers to recognise the symptoms of others.]]

'''Diving medicine''', also called '''undersea and hyperbaric medicine''' (UHB), is the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of conditions caused by humans entering the underwater environment. It includes the effects on the body of pressure on gases, the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how a diver's fitness to dive affects the diver's safety. 

[[Hyperbaric medicine]] is a related field associated with diving, since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber is used as a treatment for two of the most significant diving-related illnesses, [[decompression sickness]] and [[arterial gas embolism]].

Diving medicine deals with medical research on issues of diving, the prevention of diving disorders, treatment of diving accidents and diving fitness. The field includes the effect of breathing gases and their contaminants under high pressure on the human body and the relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety.

In diving accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications.

Diving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine, and an important part of diver education.

Teaching of diving theory is usually provided as classroom lecture sessions with formative assessment tasks and exercises and a written examination for final assessment. [[Blended learning]] is used by some agencies and schools to ensure a more consistent standard.

==Other theory based knowledge==
{{see also|Diving regulations}}
Professional divers are required to be familiar with the law regulating their occupation, and any national or international [[codes of practice]] that apply in the region where they will practice. National legislation will commonly be included in the curriculum for entry level professional diving, and may be recognised as prior learning for further diver training. The level of knowledge required of a diving supervisor is considerably higher, and is usually part of supervisor training and assessment.&lt;ref name="Class IV Supervisor training standard" /&gt;

Occupational heath and safety are important aspects of professional diving. The diver is expected to understand the hazards, risks and potential consequences of diving at work and using the equipment provided in the environment of the project, and though risk assessment and team safety on the job are primarily the responsbility of the supervisor and the employer, the diver is also responsible as a member of the team and is expected to have sufficient knowledge of the processes for informed consent.&lt;ref name="CoP Inshore 2017" /&gt;

==Dive planning==
{{main|Dive planning}}
[[File:Shotline with deco trapeze.png|thumb|A shotline with decompression trapeze provides a relatively safe and convenient place for in-water decompression.]]

'''Dive planning''' is the practical application of theoretical knowledge and understanding. It is the process of planning an underwater diving operation. The purpose of dive planning is to increase the probability that a dive will be completed safely and the goals achieved.&lt;ref name="NOAA 4th Ed"/&gt; Some form of planning is done for most underwater dives, but the complexity and detail considered may vary enormously.&lt;ref name="Gurr 2008" /&gt; In most professional diving, dive planning is mainly the responsibility of the supervisor, but the diver is expected to understand the process sufficiently to know when it has been done correctly. In recreational diving, unless under training, the diver is generally considered equally responsible for the planning of any dive they participate in, along with the other involved divers, so dive planning at the level of certification is an important aspect of recreational diver training.

[[Professional diving]] operations are usually formally planned and the plan documented as a legal record that due diligence has been done for health and safety purposes.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UK Diving at work regulations 1997"/&gt; [[Recreational diving|Recreational]] dive planning may be less formal, but for complex [[Technical diving|technical dives]], can be as formal, detailed and extensive as most professional dive plans. A professional diving contractor will be constrained by the code of practice, standing orders or regulatory legislation covering a project or specific operations within a project, and is responsible for ensuring that the scope of work to be done is within the scope of the rules relevant to that work.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009"/&gt; A recreational (including technical) diver or dive group is generally less constrained, but nevertheless is almost always restricted by some legislation, and often also the rules of the organisations to which the divers are affiliated.&lt;ref name="Gurr 2008" /&gt;

The planning of a diving operation may be simple or complex. In some cases the processes may have to be repeated several times before a satisfactory plan is achieved, and even then the plan may have to be modified on site to suit changed circumstances. The final product of the planning process may be formally documented or, in the case of recreational divers, an agreement on how the dive will be conducted. A diving project may consist of a number of related diving operations.&lt;ref name="SURG Vol 1" /&gt;

A documented dive plan may contain elements from the following list:&lt;ref name="NOAA 4th Ed"/&gt;
*Overview of Diving Activities
*Schedule of Diving Operations
*Specific Dive Plan Information
*Budget

For scuba dives, selection of the breathing gases and calculation of the required quantities is one of the most complex parts of dive planing, and is done in parallel with planning of the dive profile and decompression plan.

The general aspects of dive planning include the following, but not all of these apply to every dive, and in many cases there is no choice available to the diver, who must work within the constraints of what is available and appropriate to their level of competence. Planning of a complex dive may be an iterative process, and the order of steps may vary.&lt;ref name="SURG Vol 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mount 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IMCA D022" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CoP Inshore 2017" /&gt;
*Purpose of the dive.
*Site analysis, environmental aspects and known hazards of the site and task.
*Selection of mode and techniques of diving. This aspect is often severely limited, and for training purposes is usually linked to the training standard.
*Selection of team. 
*Estimation of depth and time, dive profile, decompression plan. These are generally constrained by the purpose and site.
*Choice of equipment.
*Gas planning for the planned profile, allowing for contingencies and foreseeable emergencies.
*Risk assessment is based on the planning to this point. The assessed risk must be acceptable if the dive is to be done. It may be possible to reduce an unacceptable risk by changing the plan.
*Contingency and emergency planning depend on the outcome of the risk assessment.
*Other logistical considerations, arranging permits and permission to dive, schedule of tasks and budgeting.
*Schedule of tasks and budget.
Teaching of dive planning typically omits any aspects not relevant to the certification level, and to some extent the certification will be defined by the competence requirements for dive planning. Assessment of dive planning competence is commonly a combination of written exams on the details, and direct observation of performance of dive planning tasks.

== Diving skills ==
{{see also|Scuba skills|Surface-supplied diving skills}}
[[File:Diving training -c.jpg|thumb|The instructor monitors a trainee practicing diving skills]]

'''Scuba skills''' are the skills required to dive safely using [[Scuba set|self-contained underwater breathing apparatus]], (scuba). Most of these skills are relevant to both open circuit and [[Rebreather diving|rebreather scuba]], and many are also relevant to [[surface-supplied diving]]. Those skills which are critical to the safety of the diver may require more practice than is usually provided during training to achieve reliable long-term proficiency&lt;ref name="Egstrom 1992" /&gt;

Some of the skills are generally accepted by recreational [[Diving certification|diver certification]] agencies&lt;ref name="WRSTC OWTS" /&gt; as necessary for any [[Scuba diving|scuba diver]] to be considered competent to dive without direct supervision, and others are more advanced, though some [[List of diver certification organizations|diver certification and accreditation organizations]] may consider some of these to also be essential for minimum acceptable entry level competence.&lt;ref name="IDSA Level 1" /&gt; Divers are instructed and assessed on these skills during basic and advanced training, and are expected to remain competent at their level of certification, either by practice or refresher courses.

The skills include selection, functional testing, preparation and transport of scuba equipment, dive planning, preparation for a dive, kitting up for the dive, water entry, descent, breathing underwater, monitoring the dive profile (depth, time and decompression status), personal breathing gas management, situational awareness, communicating with the dive team, buoyancy and trim control, mobility in the water, ascent, emergency and rescue procedures, exit from the water, unkitting after the dive, cleaning and preparation of equipment for storage and recording the dive, within the scope of the diver's certification.&lt;ref name="WRSTC OWTS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IDSA Level 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Class IV DTS" /&gt;&lt;ref name=BSAC /&gt;

[[File:Commercial diver training at Blue Rock Quarry P3233799.JPG|thumb|Commercial surface supplied diver training in a flooded quarry]]

'''Surface supplied diving skills''' are the skills and procedures required for the safe operation and use of surface-supplied [[diving equipment]]. Besides these skills, which may be categorised as standard operating procedures, emergency procedures and rescue procedures, there are the actual working skills required to do the job, and the procedures for safe operation of the work equipment other than diving equipment that may be needed.

Some of the skills are common to all types of surface-supplied equipment and deployment modes, others are specific to the type of bell or stage, or to [[saturation diving]]. There are other skills required of divers which apply to the surface support function, and some of those are also mentioned here.

===Training methods for diving skills===
Diving skills are practical skills, suitable for learning by performing and improvement by correct repetition and overlearning. Many of the diving skills are safety-critical – incorrect performance can put the diver or another person at risk, and in some cases incorrect response can be rapidly fatal. The skill is generally discussed, demonstrated by a skilled practitioner, and then attempted by the learner in controlled conditions. Repetition with feedback from the instructor is generally continued until the skill can be performed reliably under normal conditions. Professional, particularly military training, may [[Overtraining|overtrain]] skills until they are internalised to the extent of being conditioned reflexes, requiring very little conscious thought, as adequate performance under highly stressed conditions may be necessary for survival.

===Training venues for diving skills===
Initial skills training is restricted to [[Confined water (diving)|Confined water]], a diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training purposes. This generally implies that conditions are not affected by geographic or weather conditions, and that divers can not get lost. [[Swimming pool]]s and [[diver training tank]]s are included in this category. A diver training tank is a container of water large and deep enough to practice diving and underwater work skills, usually with a window through which the exercises can be viewed by the instructor. Once competence has been demonstrated in confined water, repetition of skills in [[Open water (diving)|open water]] is usual. This is generally done in combinations that simulate realistic circumstances when reasonably practicable.

== First aid skills ==
{{see also|First aid}}
Most professional divers are required by national or state legislation to be qualified first aid providers to a specified standard. First aid training is not generally considered to be an integral part of diver training, but may be provided in parallel. First aid registration is generally valid for a limited period and must be updated to stay in-date to dive.&lt;ref name="Class IV DTS" /&gt;

== Underwater work skills ==
[[File:US Navy 100527-N-1134L-003 Navy Diver 2nd Class Sam Elliot, left, assigned to company 26 of Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit (MDSU) 2, instructs a Barbados Coast Guard diver on the proper way to use a hydraulic grinder underwater.jpg|thumb|Practical training on underwater tool use is common for professional divers. The tools will depend on the employment of the diver.]]
[[File:US Navy 030220-N-5862D-079 practicing building a flange while blindfolded.jpg|thumb|A navy diver practices mechanical work while blindfolded to simulate a low visibility environment]]
{{See also|Underwater work}}
Underwater work skills may be included in professional diver training to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the requirements of the relevant training standard, which will specify the minimum, and the diving school, which may choose to offer more than the minimum as a premium service.

Specialist work skills are generally not part of diver training, and are either learned at a specialist training facility, from the equipment manufacturer, or from the employer at the workplace.

Training methods vary depending on the specific skill, but in many cases it is more effective to first learn the skill out of the water, where it is generally safer and easier, and where immediate feedback on problems is much simpler, then learn how to do it in the underwater environment. Some work skills used underwater are more complex and difficult to learn than diving skills – it is quicker to train a skilled welder to dive well than to train a skilled diver to weld well. This principle holds particularly for professional skills. A marine scientist or archaeologist may require 3 to 5 years full-time university study to become competent in their chosen field, but can be trained to do the relevant diving in about a month.&lt;ref name="Class IV DTS" /&gt;

== Competence assessment ==
[[File:US Navy 061106-N-9708H-007 Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Christopher Perez films a student performing the Drill, Tap, and Grind portion of the Second Class Diver course at the Navy Diving ^ Salvage Training Center.jpg|thumb|video recordings of skill performance is useful for assessment and feedback, and as a record of competence]]
{{see also|Test (assessment)|Competence (human resources)}}
Competence may be assessed in several ways. Theoretical knowledge and understanding is often amenable to assessment by written examination, which has the advantage of inherently providing a permanent record.
Practical skills are more generally assessed by direct observation of a demonstration of the skill, or by inference, where successful completion of an activity implies acceptable application of the skill. In some cases simulations are used, particularly for emergency skills. Records of practical assessment are usually in the form of a report made by the assessor, which may involve the use of a checklist to ensure that all aspects have been covered, and may also include video recordings.

The level of competence required depends on the safety implications of the skill. A qualified diver should be a low risk for causing injury or death to themselves or another member of the diving team when operating within the constraints of the training standard. Competence at assessment is no guarantee of competence at a future date. Retention and improvement of skills requires practice.

== Quality assurance ==
The [[quality assurance]] of diver training is usually based on three basic components:&lt;ref name="CoP Training" /&gt;
*[[Training standard]]s – Documents which define the minimum levels of competence acceptable for a person to be registered as a diver against the specified standard. As a general rule, there will be a number of safety critical skills which must always be demonstrated as competent, and other skills and knowledge which require general competence, but where some leeway can be tolerated.&lt;br /&gt;Training manuals, assessment tools, task descriptions, checklists and other documentation may be required as evidence that training complies with the standard.&lt;ref name="CoP Training" /&gt;
*[[Quality audit|Audits]] – Periodical re-assessment of the competence of training staff and adequacy of staff, equipment, documentation and venues, by personnel authorised by the certification agency or registration authority.&lt;ref name="CoP Training" /&gt;
*Records – Permanent records of attendance, assessments, completed tasks and other documentation specified by the training standard code of practice or regulations may be required to be kept available for a specified period for inspection as evidence of adherence to standards.&lt;ref name="CoP Training" /&gt;

==Diving schools==
Diving schools are establishments where divers are trained and assessed. They range from a spare room in the home of a freelance recreational diving instructor, to a set of offices, classrooms, workshops, stores, accommodations and ancillary structures such as diving tanks, swimming pools, diving support vessels, saturation systems, hyperbaric chambers and similar, with associated staff and equipment, for a major military or commercial diving school. The minimum facilities for occupational diver training schools may be specified by a standard or code of practice, and in these cases the school may be periodically audited to ensure that the facilities comply with requirements.&lt;ref name="CoP Training" /&gt;

==Professional divers ==
{{see also|Professional diving}}

Professional divers are generally trained firstly to dive safely as a member of a dive team, and secondly in underwater work skills specific to their employment. Registration as a professional diver does not necessarily imply competence in any specific work skills other than those commonly required by the majority of professional diving work. These may be specified in the training standard associated with the specific registration, but training standards can change over time and may no longer be accurate in all details.

=== Commercial divers ===
{{see also|Professional diving|Commercial diving}}

=== Military divers ===
{{see also|Military diving}}
{{empty section|date=November 2018}}

=== Public safety divers ===
{{see also|Public safety diving}}
[[File:Nesconset FD Scuba rescue team 14539 1260593349239 6089134 n.jpg|thumb|Nesconset fire department scuba rescue team on training exercise]]
Depending on the jurisdiction, public safety divers may be required to be registered as commercial divers, or may be trained independently by specialists, or may be initially trained as recreational divers, then given additional specialist training.&lt;ref name="Phillips 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson 1002" /&gt;

In addition to basic diving skills training, public safety divers require specialized training for recognizing [[hazards]], conducting [[risk assessment]]s, [[Underwater searches|search procedures]], diving in zero visibility, using [[full-face mask]]s with communication systems, and recovering [[evidence]] that is admissible in court. Some of the water they are required to dive in is [[contaminated]], and they may be required to wear vulcanized [[drysuits]], with [[diving helmet]]s sealed to the suit, and utilize [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied air]]. At times, the [[decontamination]] process that takes place out of the water can be longer than the dive time.&lt;ref name="Robinson 1002"/&gt;

=== Scientific divers ===
{{see also|Scientific diving#Training and registration of scientific divers}}
When a scientific diving operation is part of the duties of the diver as an employee, the operation may be considered a professional diving operation subject to regulation as such. In these cases the training and registration may follow the same requirements as for other professional divers, or may include training standards specifically intended for scientific diving. In other cases, where the divers are in full control of their own diving operation, including planning and safety, diving as volunteers, the occupational health and safety regulations may not apply.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CoP Scientific" /&gt;

Where scientific diving is exempt from commercial diving regulation, training requirements may differ considerably, and in some cases basic scientific diver training and certification may not differ much from entry level recreational diver training.

Technological advances have made it possible for scientific divers to accomplish more on a dive, but they have also increased the complexity and the task loading of both the diving equipment and the work done, and consequently require higher levels of trainng and preparation to safely and effectively use this technology. It is preferable for effective learning and safety that such specialisation training is done systematically and under controlled conditions, rather than on site and on the job. Environmental conditions for training should include exercises in conditions as close as reasonably practicable to field conditions.&lt;ref name="Somers 1987a" /&gt;

=== Training standards ===
In some cases national training standards and codes of practice will apply to professional diver training, assessment and registration, for example:
*Australia: [[Australian Diver Accreditation Scheme]] (ADAS)
*[[Professional_diving#Canada|Canada]]: [[Diver Certification Board of Canada]] (DCBC)
*Norway: [[Petroleum Safety Authority Norway]] (PSA)
*[[Professional_diving#South Africa|South Africa]]: [[Department of Labour (South Africa)]] (DoL)
*[[Professional_diving#United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]: [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE)

=== International equivalence ===
{{see also|International Diving Regulators and Certifiers Forum}}
The International Diving Regulators and Certifiers Forum&lt;ref name="EDTC 2010" /&gt; (IDRF)  is a group of representatives of countries with national training standards for professional divers, who work together towards mutual recognition of diver registration and to identify and implement good practice in diver training and assessment.&lt;ref name="bell diver 2017" /&gt; Members of the IDRF include [[Australian Diver Accreditation Scheme|ADAS]] (Australia), DCBC (Canada), HSE (UK), PSA (Norway), and the Secretariat General to the Sea Progress Committee (France).

A similar arrangement for international recognition of scientific divers within Europe exists. Two levels of scientific diver registration are recognised. These represent the minimum level of training and competence required to allow scientists to participate freely throughout the countries of the European Union in underwater research projects diving using scuba. Certification or registration by an authorized national agency is a prerequisite, and depth and breathing gas limitations may  apply.&lt;ref name="ESD" /&gt;
*The {{annotated link|European Scientific Diver|abbreviation=ESD}} – A diver competent to perform as a member of a scientific diving team.&lt;ref name="ESD standards" /&gt;
*The {{annotated link|Advanced European Scientific Diver|abbreviation=AESD}} – A diver competent to organise a scientific diving team.&lt;ref name="ESD standards" /&gt;
This competence may be gained either through a formal training program, by in the field training and experience under appropriate supervision, or by a combination of these methods.&lt;ref name="ESD standards" /&gt; These standards specify the minimum basic training and competence for scientific divers, and do not consider any speciality skill requirements by employers. Further training for job-specific competence is additional to the basic competence implied by the registration.&lt;ref name="ESD standards" /&gt;

== Recreational divers ==
{{main|Recreational diver training}}
Recreational diver training is the process of developing knowledge and understanding of the basic principles, and the skills and procedures for the use of [[scuba equipment]] so that the diver is able to [[Scuba diving|dive]] for recreational purposes with acceptable risk using the type of equipment and in similar conditions to those experienced during training.

=== Recreational scuba ===

Not only is the underwater environment [[Diving hazards and precautions|hazardous]] but the [[Scuba equipment|diving equipment]] itself can be dangerous. There are problems that divers must learn to avoid and manage when they do occur.  Divers need repeated practice and a gradual increase in challenge to develop and internalise the skills needed to control the equipment, to respond effectively if they encounter difficulties, and to build confidence in their equipment and themselves. Diver practical training starts with simple but essential procedures, and builds on them until complex procedures can be managed effectively. This may be broken up into several short training programmes, with certification issued for each stage,&lt;ref name="PADI manual" /&gt; or combined into a few more substantial programmes with certification issued when all the skills have been mastered.&lt;ref name="CMAStrgprog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GUE 2011"  /&gt;

Many diver training organizations exist, throughout the world, offering diver training leading to certification: the issuing of a "[[Diving certification|Diving Certification Card]]," also known as a "C-card," or qualification card. This diving certification model originated at [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in 1952 after two divers died while using university-owned equipment and the SIO instituted a system where a card was issued after training as evidence of competence.&lt;ref name="Scripps" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SIO Certification" /&gt; Diving instructors affiliated to a diving certification agency may work independently or through a university, a dive club, a dive school or a dive shop.  They will offer courses that should meet, or exceed, the standards of the [[List of diver certification organizations|certification organization]] that will certify the divers attending the course. The [[International Organization for Standardization]] has approved six recreational diving standards that may be implemented worldwide, and some of the standards developed by the [[World Recreational Scuba Training Council#United States RSTC|(United States) RSTC]] are consistent with the applicable ISO Standards:&lt;ref name="WRSTC ISO" /&gt;

The initial open water training for a person who is [[Fitness to dive|medically fit to dive]] and a reasonably competent swimmer is relatively short. Many dive shops in popular holiday locations offer courses intended to teach a novice to dive in a few days, which can be combined with diving on the vacation.&lt;ref name="PADI manual" /&gt; Other instructors and dive schools will provide more thorough training, which generally takes longer.&lt;ref name="GUE 2011"  /&gt; Dive operators, [[dive center|dive shops]], and cylinder filling stations may refuse to allow uncertified people to dive with them, hire diving equipment or have their [[diving cylinder]]s filled. This may be an agency standard, company policy, or specified by legislation.&lt;ref name="Rec Diving Act 1979" /&gt;

=== Technical diving ===
{{see also|Technical diving}}
[[File:Tech diver at lake Iso-Melkutin Finland 2013.jpg|thumb|Tech diver training]]
Technical diving requires specialised equipment and training. There are many technical training organisations: see the Technical Diving section in the [[list of diver certification organizations]]. [[Technical Diving International]] (TDI), [[Global Underwater Explorers]] (GUE), Professional Scuba Association International (PSAI), [[International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers]] (IANTD) and [[National Association of Underwater Instructors]] (NAUI) were popular {{as of|2009|lc=on}}. Recent entries into the market include [[Unified Team Diving]] (UTD), InnerSpace Explorers (ISE) and [[Diving Science and Technology]] (DSAT), the technical arm of [[Professional Association of Diving Instructors]] (PADI). The [[Scuba Schools International]] (SSI) Technical Diving Program (TechXR – Technical eXtended Range) was launched in 2005.&lt;ref name="techxr" /&gt;

[[British Sub-Aqua Club]] (BSAC) training has always had a technical element to its higher qualifications, however, it has recently begun to introduce more technical level Skill Development Courses into all its training schemes by introducing technical awareness into its lowest level qualification of Ocean Diver, for example, and nitrox training will become mandatory. It has also recently introduced trimix qualifications and continues to develop closed circuit training.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Freediving ===
{{see also|Freediving}}
In most jurisdictions, no certification is required for freediving, and the equipment is sold freely over the counter with no questions asked of the purchaser's competence to use it. Most freedivers learn the skills from practice, often with some coaching from a friend, and sometimes attend a formal training programme presented by a qualified and registered instructor, with assessment and certification of competence as the target.&lt;ref name="SSI Freediving" /&gt;

Some recreational diver training agencies offer training and certification in freediving, sometimes known as a snorkel certificate.&lt;ref name="CMAS snorkel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SSI snorkel" /&gt; 
Professional diver training standards may include freediving at basic level as part of scuba training and assessment.&lt;ref name="Class IV DTS" /&gt;

== Training of diving support personnel ==

Professional diving support personnel are the members of the professional diving team, which at minimum includes a working diver, a standby diver and a supervisor:
*{{annotated link|Diving supervisor}}. Usually regulated by the same legislation as for professional divers.
*{{annotated link|Stand-by diver}}. All professional divers are qualified to act as standby diver as part of their duties.
*{{annotated link|Bellman (diving)|Bellman}}. All divers qualified to dive from a bell are also qualified to act as bellman as part of their duties.
*{{annotated link|Chamber operator}}. May be regulated by the same legislation as for professional divers.
*{{annotated link|Diver's attendant}}. Not usually a regulated occupation, but often the post is filled by another diver.
*{{annotated link|Life support technician}}. Usually regulated by the same legislation as for professional divers.
*{{annotated link|Diving medical technician}}. Usually regulated by the same legislation as for professional divers.
*{{annotated link|Diving instructor}}. Usually regulated by the same legislation as for professional divers.

Recreational diving support may only be one person, but can be more:
*{{annotated link|Dive leader|aka=Divemaster}}. Similar to recreational diving certification systems, but may require membership and registration with the certification organisation.
*{{annotated link|Diving instructor}}. Similar to recreational diving certification systems, but requires membership and registration with the certification organisation. Cross-over training is usually available, and multiple certification and membership is common.
*{{annotated link|Dive boat skipper}}. Varies with national legislation. In some countries there is no specific requirement, in others there may be regulation, and it may vary between professional and recreational skippers.

Support personnel who are not generally part of the dive team, and apply similarly to professional and recreational diving, include:
*{{annotated link|Compressor operator}}
*{{annotated link|Gas blender}}
*{{annotated link|Equipment technician}}
In all three of these cases requirements vary with national legislation. In some countries there is no specific requirement, in others some form of assessed competency may be necessary. Equipment technicians often have some equipment specific training from the equipment manufacturers, but the fundamental skill level required may vary considerably.

'''Electronic Information for Libraries (EIFL)''' works with libraries worldwide to enable access to digital information for people in developing and transition countries. They are an international not-for-profit organisation based in [[Vilnius]] with a global network of partners.

Founded in 1999, EIFL began by advocating for affordable access to commercial e-journals for academic and research libraries in Central and Eastern Europe. EIFL now partners with libraries and library consortia in more than 60 developing and transition countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Their work has expanded to include other programmes that enable access to knowledge for education, learning, research and community development.

== History ==
EIFL began as eIFL.net in 1999 as an initiative of the [[Open Society Institute]] (OSI), a private grant-making foundation that is part of the [[Soros Foundation]] network during the time that publisher [[Frances Pinter]] was head of its international publishing programme. Recognising the role that libraries play in the exchange of ideas, [[knowledge]] and [[information]] and the development of [[open societies]], OSI invested in library development and modernisation especially in the post-socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

These countries represented [[emerging markets]] for international providers of scholarly and academic information. However, the barriers to access were formidable with little money to pay for expensive electronic resources, poor technological infrastructures, lack of capacity and  little awareness of electronic alternatives to print subscriptions. This deprived libraries of the wealth of international academic journals and databases and the opportunities of digital technologies.

OSI through EIFL aimed to assist libraries and their users in achieving access to electronic scholarly resources. EIFL negotiates licences with [[publishers]] for electronic resources on behalf of its members. As access to Internet-based digital material can be expanded at marginal cost to the provider, the idea is to leverage the purchasing power of individually "poor" customers and negotiate a multi-country consortial deal with information providers. EIFL acts as an agent for the national library consortia, who manages promotion and use of the electronic resources locally. Libraries and their users have access to thousands of full-text academic and scholarly journals from the arts to zoology through EIFL licences. 

In 2002, EIFL became an independent foundation registered in the Netherlands with its operational seat in Rome, Italy. EIFL is a member of the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) and the [[International Coalition of Library Consortia]] (ICOLC).

== Approach==
EIFL’s approach is to partner with libraries organised into national library consortia – groups of libraries that share common goals – thereby effectively reaching millions of people. Consortia include university, research and public libraries, and other institutions. At EIFL:
*  They organize training events, developing tools and resources, and providing information on issues that affect access to knowledge,
*  They advocate for access to knowledge nationally and internationally,
*  They encourage knowledge sharing through peer-to-peer learning, best practice case studies, an annual partner conference and regional cooperation among consortia,
*  They incubate pilot projects for public library services.

== Partner countries ==
EIFL works with national library consortia and public libraries in  over 60 developing and transition countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America. To see the list go to [http://www.eifl.net/where-we-work www.eifl.net/where-we-work]

'''Episkopon''' ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]]: ΕΠΙΣΚΟΠΩΝ, "[[bishop]]") is a [[secret society]] at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]] in the [[University of Toronto]], which has been active since 1858 when its male branch was founded. The 225th reading was held in 2011.&lt;ref name = "Review"&gt;''[http://main.library.utoronto.ca/webcat/goto_catalogue_url.cfm?where=ckey&amp;what=476369 Trinity, 1852-1952]'': Published as a special centennial issue of the Trinity Review.{{Verify source|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A female branch of Episkopon has been active since 1899, holding their 175th Reading in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sce.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/Trinity_College_Background|title=Trinity College Background|last=|first=|date=March 2012|website=The Senior College Encyclopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Prominent alumni of the Episkopon include Former Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Bill Graham (Canadian politician)|Bill Graham]], filmmaker [[Atom Egoyan]], and Former Canadian [[Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]].

The male and female branches both present three annual Readings during which they publicly satirize the goings-on about college through a wide range of jokes, songs, and poems delivered mostly by the branch's leader, the Scribe.&lt;ref name = "Mitchell" /&gt; The society's mythological premise is to deliver "gentle chastisement" on behalf of the Venerable Father (or Mother) Episkopon, a spirit who supposedly resides at Trinity and who is represented at Readings by a human skull.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; Described in the media as a "self-perpetuating board of directors", the clandestine group of former Scribes and their assisting editors style themselves as the Order of the Golden Key.&lt;ref name = "Hill"&gt;Hill, Declan. "The Tempest at Trinity". ''[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]'', 1993. Toronto: [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]]&lt;/ref&gt; The motto of the organization is from [[Horace]]: ''Notandi Sunt Tibi Mores'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: "The manners of men are to be carefully observed").

In 1992, Episkopon was censured and forcibly disassociated by the Trinity College Council following allegations of racism and homophobia.&lt;ref name = "Mitchell"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Is the student society at venerable Trinity College guilty of offensive human-rights abuses? Or is this another sanctimonious outcry from the prissy ranks of the politically correct? |journal= [[The Globe and Mail]] |date= 1992-09-05 |last= Mitchell |first= Alanna |pages=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite policies prohibiting Episkopon from engaging in any activities on College property, the society has nevertheless continued to play a controversial role in undergraduate life at Trinity.&lt;ref name= "Star"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[The Toronto Star]] |first= Tanya |last= Talaga |title= Secret student group divides U of T's Trinity College; Once banned from campus, society returns |date= 1999-03-27 |pages= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Episkopon has existed since 1858, when it was announced that the first Scribe was Pakenham Edward Stewart, later an [[Anglican]] priest.&lt;ref name = "Review" /&gt; Episkopon began as a [[student newspaper]], developed into a form in which only one copy of each edition was created, to be read aloud by the Scribe.&lt;ref name = "Review" /&gt; Episkopon provides insight into College history, through the keeping of archives dating back to 1879.{{When|date=April 2010}}&lt;ref name = "Mitchell" /&gt; A poster by artist [[Roloff Beny]] advertising a Reading from 1945 is in possession of the [[National Archives of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mikan3.archives.ca/pam/public_mikan/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&amp;lang=eng&amp;rec_nbr=185554&amp; National Archives of Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930202022/http://mikan3.archives.ca/pam/public_mikan/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&amp;lang=eng&amp;rec_nbr=185554&amp; |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the National Archives is a film about the former Trinity College campus on [[Queen Street West]], made by [[Gordon Sparling]], in which Episkopon's traditions feature prominently.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} A board listing the names of female Scribes once hung in Trinity's St. Hilda's College, but was removed upon the group's decision to disassociate from the College, a show of solidarity with the male branch in the 1990s.{{When|date=April 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In 2018, the Trinity College Meeting - the student government of Trinity College - passed a non-binding motion requesting student leaders not to join Episkopon.

==Controversy==
One attempted student suicide was allegedly linked to a 1985 reading, although the circumstances of the connection were not reported.&lt;ref name="Star"/&gt; In October 1991, following accusations{{By whom|date=April 2010}} of racism, sexism, and homophobia in Episkopon, a task force was formed to investigate it and Trinity College at large.&lt;ref name = "Mitchell"/&gt; When the male Scribe of the 1992-1993 academic year refused to draft a constitution that was consistent with the task force's recommendations, the Trinity College Council voted unanimously to sever all ties with the organization.&lt;ref name = "sever"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[The Globe and Mail]] |first= Donald |last= Grant |title= Toronto Live: Links to Episkopon Cut |date= 1992-10-06 |pages= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigative journalist [[Declan Hill]], a Trinity alumnus,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.declanhill.com/resumes/DHill-resume2009.doc Declan Hill's resume on his personal website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709005319/http://www.declanhill.com/resumes/DHill-resume2009.doc |date=2011-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a 1993 documentary broadcast on the [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]] program ''[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]'', claimed that Episkopon's Readings tended to ridicule certain groups and actions as a form of social control. The article cited student objections to the singling out of individuals for public shaming.&lt;ref name= "Post"&gt;{{cite journal |journal = [[National Post]] |last = Black |first = Shannon |title = Juvenile jokes or cruel cuts?

[[File:FromWhereYouDream.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Grove/Atlantic]])]]

'''''From Where You Dream: The Process of writing fiction''''' is a transcription and condensation of [[Robert Olen Butler]]'s Masters class on writing. Put together and edited by [[Janet Burroway]], it emphasizes dreamspace or unconscious writing as opposed to thinking or analytical writing in order to create a good or true work of art. It purports that yearning, or motivation, is the key point of craft missed by inexperienced writers.

It is cut up into three main sections, "The Lecture", "The Workshop", and "The Stories Analyzed", where he details why getting to the "white hot" unconscious is important and tactics on how to find it and write it well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20431">The '''history of education in Canada''' covers schooling from elementary through university, plus the ideas of educators, plus the policies of national and provincial governments. According to Brenda B. MacKay and Michael W. Firmin, Phillips in 1957 periodized the history of public schooling in terms of four stages:
:The first was characterized by church-controlled education and lasted from the early 1700s through to the mid 1800s. Stage two, which extended to the late 1800s, saw the introduction of more centralized authority, universal free education, and taxation for schooling at the local level. Stage three, the early 1900s, saw the development of provincial departments of education, a more consistent curriculum, better trained  teachers and the start of provincial government financial support for schools. The fourth stage, since the Second World War, has been characterized by the appointment of Ministers of Education in each provincial government and a far greater involvement of government in all aspects of education.&lt;ref&gt;Brenda B. MacKay and Michael W. Firmin, "The Historical Development of Private Education in Canada"  ''Educational Research &amp; Perspectives'' (2008) p 68, citing Charles Phillips, ''The development of education in Canada'' (1957). &lt;/ref&gt;
 
For the current situation see [[Education in Canada]].

==Religious schools==
The first schools in [[New France]] were operated by the Catholic church (as indeed were schools in France itself). In the early nineteenth century the colonial governments moved to set up publicly funded education systems. Protestants and Catholics were deeply divided over how religious and moral education should be delivered. In Upper Canada the Catholic minority rejected the Protestant practice of Biblical study in schools, while in Lower Canada the Protestant minority objected to the education system instilling Roman Catholic dogma. Thus in both these areas two schools systems were established, a Catholic and a Protestant.

Upon [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] these schools systems were enshrined in the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act (BNA), 1867]].  Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the BNA Act to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of the Protestant and Catholic minorities. Thus, separate Catholic schools and school boards were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario's provincial capital at this time.

British Columbia established a non-sectarian school system in 1872. 

In the three Maritime provinces, schools were mainly Protestant, and a single Protestant oriented school system was established in each of them. In [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] there was not only the Catholic/Protestant split, but also deep divisions between Protestant sects, and nine separate schools systems were set up, one catering to each major denomination. Eventually the major Protestant boards merged into an integrated school system.

Over time, the originally Protestant school boards of English Canada, known as the public schools, became increasingly secularized as Canadians came to believe in the [[separation of Church and state]], and the main boards became secular ones. In Ontario all overt religiosity was removed from the public school system in 1990. In two provinces the sectarian education systems have recently been eliminated through constitutional change. Newfoundland and Labrador eliminated its tri-denominational Catholic-Protestant-Pentecostal system after two referendums. In Quebec the Catholic/Protestant divide was replaced with a French language/English language one.

Religious colleges are attached to numerous universities. &lt;ref&gt;Laurence K. Shook, ''Catholic Post-Secondary Education in English-Speaking Canada: A History'' (University of Toronto Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;
===Language war and school crisis in Ontario===
{{main|Regulation 17}}
In Ontario in 1912, the Conservative government of Sir [[James P. Whitney]] issued [[Regulation 17]] which severely limited the availability of French-language schooling to the province's French-speaking minority.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Craig Brown,  and Ramsay Cook, ''Canada, 1896-1921: A nation transformed'' (1974) pp 253-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chad Gaffield, ''Language, Schooling, and Cultural Conflict: The Origins of the French Language Controversy in Ontario'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; French could only be used in the first two years of schooling, and then only English was allowed. Few of the teachers at these schools were fluent in English, so they had to shut down. 

French-Canadians—growing rapidly in number in eastern Ontario because of migration,  reacted with outrage, journalist [[Henri Bourassa]] denouncing the "Prussians of Ontario"--a stinging rebuke since Canada was at war with Prussia and Germany at the time.  It was one of the key reasons the Francophones turned away from the war effort in 1915 and refused to enlist. Ontario's Catholics were led by the Irish, who united with the Protestants in opposing French schools.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Cecillon, "Turbulent Times in the Diocese of London: Bishop Fallon and the French-Language Controversy, 1910-18," ''Ontario History,'' Dec 1995, Vol. 87 Issue 4, pp 369-395&lt;/ref&gt; 

Regulation 17 was eventually repealed in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Barber, "The Ontario Bilingual Schools Issue: Sources of Conflict," ''Canadian Historical Review,'' (1966) 47#3 , pp 227-248&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Jack D. Cecillon, ''Prayers, Petitions, and Protests: The Catholic Church and the Ontario Schools Crisis in the Windsor Border Region, 1910-1928'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;
==Prairies==
The three Prairie provinces adopted a system based on Ontario's with a dominant Protestant system, and smaller Catholic ones. 
===Manitoba Schools Question===
In 1891, Manitoba moved to eliminate the Catholic board, sparking the [[Manitoba Schools Question]]. It demonstrated the deep divergence of cultural, religious and language values and became an issue of national importance. The Catholic Franco-Manitobains had been guaranteed a state-supported separate school system in the original constitution of Manitoba, such that their children would be taught in French. However a grassroots political movement among English Protestants from 1888 to 1890 demanded the end of French schools. In 1890, the Manitoba legislature passed a law removing funding for French Catholic schools.&lt;ref name="language"&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Fletcher, Robert|date=1949|title=The Language Problem in Manitoba's Schools|journal=MHS Transactions|publisher=Manitoba Historical Society|volume=3|issue=6|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French Catholic minority asked the federal government for support; however, the [[Orange Order in Canada|Orange Order]] and other anti-Catholic forces mobilized nationwide to oppose them.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|author=McLauchlin, Kenneth|date=1986|title="Riding The Protestant Horse": The Manitoba School Question and Canadian Politics, 1890–1896|journal=Historical Studies|publisher=CCHA|volume=53|pages=39–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservatives]] proposed remedial legislation to override Manitoba, but they were blocked by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], led by [[Wilfrid Laurier]], who opposed the remedial legislation because of his belief in provincial rights.&lt;ref name="language" /&gt; The Manitoba Schools issue became an issue in the [[Canadian federal election, 1896|Canadian federal election of 1896]], where it worked against the Conservatives and helped elect the Liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Crunican, ''Priests and Politicians: Manitoba Schools and the Election of 1896'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; As Prime Minister, Laurier implemented a compromise stating that Catholics in Manitoba could have their own religious instruction for 30 minutes at the end of the day if there were enough students to warrant it, implemented on a school-by-school basis.&lt;ref name="language" /&gt;

===Alberta===
The Catholic archbishop of Edmonton, Henry Joseph O'Leary had a considerable impact on the city's Catholic sectors, and his efforts reflect many of the challenges facing the Catholic Church at that time. During the 1920s, O'Leary favored his fellow Irish and drastically reduced the influence of French Catholic clergy in his archdiocese and replaced them with Anglophone priests. He helped to assimilate Ukrainian Catholic immigrants into the stricter Roman Catholic traditions, extended the viability of Edmonton's separate Catholic school system, and established both a Catholic college at the University of Alberta and a seminary in Edmonton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=McGuigan |title=Edmonton, Archbishop Henry O'Leary and the Roaring Twenties |work=Alberta History |date=1996 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pp=6–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892 Alberta adopted the Ontario schools model, emphasizing state-run institutions that stressed the English language, English history and English customs. The Catholic community, under the control of Irish, joined the British Protestant community in these new policies, despite the complaints of the French-Canadian minority. Predominantly francophone communities in Alberta maintained some control of local schools by electing trustees sympathetic to French language and culture. Such groups as the Association Canadienne-Française de l'Alberta expected trustees to implement their own cultural agenda. An additional problem francophone communities faced was the constant shortage of qualified francophone teachers during 1908-35; the majority of those hired left their positions after only a few years of service. After 1940 school consolidation largely ignored the language and culture issues of francophones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Yvette T. M. |last=Mahé |title=Bilingual School District Trustees and Cultural Transmission: The Alberta Experience, 1892-1939 |work=Historical Studies in Education |date=1997 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pp=65–82 |issn=0843-5057 |url=http://historicalstudiesineducation.ca/index.php/edu_hse-rhe/article/download/1435/1559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadianization of immigrants===
After 1870 numerous non-Anglophone immigrants arrived from Europe, including Germans, Ukrainians, Scandinavians and many others. Large numbers headed to the attractive free farms in the Prairie Provinces. Education was a central factor in their assimilation into Canadian culture and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Manfred |last=Prokop |title=Canadianization of Immigrant Children: Role of the Rural Elementary School in Alberta, 1900-1930 |work=Alberta History |year=1989 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=1–10 |url=http://peel.library.ualberta.ca/bibliography/9021.37.2/3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important indicator of assimilation was the use of English; the children of all immigrant groups showed a strong preference in favour of speaking English, regardless of their parents' language. From 1900 to 1930, the governments of the Prairie Provinces faced the formidable task of transforming the ethnically and linguistically diverse immigrant population into loyal and true Canadians. Many officials believed language assimilation by children would be the key to Canadianization.  However, there was opposition to the direct method of English teaching from some immigrant spokesmen. English-language usage in playground games often proved an effective device, and was systematically  used. The elementary schools especially in rural Alberta played a central role in the acculturation of the immigrants and their children, providing, according to Prokop, a community character that created a distinctive feature of Canadian schools glaringly missing in the European school tradition.

==Academic versus vocational education==
Historic educational ideals in Canada, contrasted to the United States,  have been more elitist, with an emphasis on training church and political elites along British lines. In 1960, for example 9.2 percent of Canadians aged 20 to 24 were enrolled in higher education, compared to 30.2 percent in the United States. Even at the secondary level, enrollments were higher in the United States.  Furthermore, the United States has long led in vocational, technical and professional education, while the Canadian schools resist their inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Martin Lipset, '' Revolution and Counterrevolution: Change and persistence in social structures'' (2nd ed, 1970) pp 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;  According to research by Lawrence Downey:
: Canadians, as a group, assigned considerably higher priority than did Americans to knowledge, scholarly attitudes, creative skills, aesthetic appreciation, and morality , as outcomes of schooling. Americans emphasized physical development, citizenship, patriotism, social skills, and family living much more than did Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence William Downey, ''The task of public education: The perceptions of people'' (Midwest Administration Center, University of Chicago, 1960), Quoted in Lipset, ''Revolution and Counterrevolution'' p 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivor F. Goodson and Ian R. Dowbiggin have explored the battle over vocational education in London, Ontario, in the 1900-1930 era,  a time when American cities were rapidly expanding their vocational offerings. The  London Technical and Commercial High School came under heavy attack from the city's social and business elite, which saw the school as a threat to the budget of the city's only academic high school, London Collegiate Institute.&lt;ref&gt; Ivor F. Goodson and Ian R. Dowbiggin, "Vocational education and school reform: the case of the London (Canada) Technical School, 1900-1930" ''History of Education Review'' (1991) 20#1: 39–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational theory==
Ontario took the lead in the early 20th century in developing a theoretical approach to education that was not only taught in universities, but largely shaped government policies in Ontario, and in other provinces as well.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stamp, "Education and the economic and social milieu: The English-Canadian scene from the 1870’s to 1914." in Robert M. Stamp and J. Donald Wilson eds, ''Canadian education: A history'' (1970) pp: 290-313.&lt;/ref&gt;  The central theme was that schooling could be approached in scientific fashion. &lt;ref&gt;Patrice Milewski, "The scientisation of schooling in Ontario, 1910-1934." ''Paedagogica Historica'' (2010) 46#3 pp 341-355. &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14940">The '''[[RMIT University|Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]]''' ('''RMIT''') is an Australian [[public university]], founded by The Hon. [[Francis Ormond]] [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|MLA]] in 1887, in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

== The Working Men's College ==
{{see|Working Men's College, Melbourne}}
[[File:Francis Ormond.png|thumb|180px|right|RMIT founder, [[Francis Ormond]]]]
In 1881, prominent [[Pastoral farming|grazier]] and [[philanthropist]], The Hon. [[Francis Ormond]], proposed that a [[technical college]] would serve "useful" to City of [[Melbourne]]. Ormond, who had donated the majority of funds towards the foundation of [[Ormond College]] at the [[University of Melbourne]], offered £5,000 towards the establishment of a college on the proviso that the public contribute a "like sum".&lt;ref name=RMIT&gt;{{harvnb|Murray-Smith|Dare|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ross&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time Line"&gt;[http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse;ID=q0dhwbxncmdc A Timeline of RMIT history (RMIT Homepage)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805200853/http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse;ID=q0dhwbxncmdc |date=2008-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A considerable sum was raised by the Council of the [[Melbourne Trades Hall]], which rallied support amongst its membership of unions. Construction of the "[[Working Men's College, Melbourne|Working Men's College]]" then began in 1886, on a site provided by the Colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], next to the [[Melbourne Magistrates' Court]], and adjacent the [[State Library of Victoria|Melbourne Public Library]] on [[La Trobe Street, Melbourne|La Trobe Street]]. The College was officially opened during a gala ceremony on June 4, 1887&lt;ref name="RMIT"/&gt; and, on the night of its opening, took 320 enrollments which increased to over 1000 in its first 12 months of operation. Ormond, a staunch believer in the values of education and a tireless campaigner for the College, served as its President until his death in 1889.&lt;ref name="RMIT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ross" /&gt;

The College began offering full-time courses in 1899 and was incorporated under the "''Companies Act''" as a private college in 1904.&lt;ref name="RMIT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time Line"/&gt; Around the turn of the century, it began developing courses in [[engineering]], [[applied science]], [[chemistry]], [[metallurgy]] and [[mining]]. Between the 1900s and the 1920s, the College expanded beyond its foundation building, and constructed two new buildings on nearby Bowen Street, a new Art School and also acquired the neighbouring, and recently decommissioned, [[Old Melbourne Gaol|Melbourne Gaol]] site for expansion.&lt;ref name="RMIT"/&gt;

During the 1930s, the College underwent further expansion with the completion of an Engineering School and a Radio School, and two more buildings constructed on Bowen Street. In 1934, the College officially changed its name to the "Melbourne Technical College" (incorporating The Working Men's College), after a representation from its Student's Association.&lt;ref name="RMIT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time Line"/&gt;

== Legend of Ned Kelly's remains ==
After the closure and partial demolishment of the nearby [[Old Melbourne Gaol]], during the 1920s, the College acquired the site for future expansion. In 1929, the remains of Australia's most notorious [[bushranger]], [[Ned Kelly]] (who was hanged at the gaol), were believed to have been discovered during the construction of the Kernot Engineering School. These remains were later reinterred [[Pentridge Prison]], and rediscovered in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/03/09/2184323.htm Archaeologists sift grave for Kelly remains] - [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]], 9 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, no conclusive evidence of the remains suggest they are that of Ned Kelly's, and many historians believe his remains are still buried under the present day RMIT.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120709173159/http://bordermail.yourguide.com.au/news/local/news/general/doubt-on-bones-find/242405.aspx Doubt on bone find] - [[The Border Mail]], 12 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contribution to WWI and WWII ==
[[File:RMITBuilding9(Historical)j.jpg|thumb|left|Radio Communication Building in 1950]]
The College contributed to Australia's war efforts both in [[World War I]] and in [[World War II]]. Initially, between 1917 and 1919, it trained over 1500 returned [[ANZAC]] service men from World War I in vocational qualifications for post-war life in Australia.&lt;ref name="RMIT"/&gt; Between 1939 and 1945, during World War II, it made a greater contribution to Australia's war efforts by training 23,000 service men and women (approximately one-sixth of all trained in Australia),&lt;ref name="RMIT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse;ID=m6991zmldybd RMIT soldiers on during war time] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019232144/http://rmit.edu.au/browse;ID=m6991zmldybd |date=2009-10-19 }} - [http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse;ID=nrv8rk31811 Openline (RMIT News)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026030838/http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse;ID=nrv8rk31811 |date=2008-10-26 }}, 24 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; mainly [[Royal Australian Air Force]] personnel in radio communications, as well as 2,000 civilians in munitions manufacturing. The [[Government of Australia]] also commissioned the College to manufacture parts for the Air Force's [[Bristol Beaufort|DAP Beaufort Bomber]].&lt;ref name="RMIT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time Line"/&gt;

After World War II, and during the 1950s, the College again trained returned service men and women for post-war life, which prompted the development of courses in [[food technology]], [[logistics|transport studies]], [[accountancy]] and [[advertising]], and the revision of its art syllabuses. During this time, the College also embraced the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]' newly devised [[Colombo Plan]], which increased its intake of [[South East Asia]]n students greatly.&lt;ref name="Time Line"/&gt;

== Royal patronage and birth of RMIT ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:RMIT Coat of Arms.jpg|thumb|120px|right|RMIT's arms feature the [[St Edward’s Crown]], to mark its royal patronage]] --&gt;
In 1954, the College was awarded [[patronage|royal patronage]] by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] - for its service to the Commonwealth in the area of education and for its contribution to the war effort; and was officially renamed the "Royal Melbourne Technical College".&lt;ref name="RMIT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time Line"/&gt; It became (and remains to this day) the only higher education institution in Australia with the right of the prefix "Royal" along with the use of the [[Monarchy of England]]'s [[regalia]].&lt;ref name="RMIT"/&gt;

In 1960, the Council of the College voted to begin the process of reconstituting the college as a tertiary institution. The name of the College was then officially changed to the "'''Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology'''".&lt;ref name="RMIT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time Line"/&gt;

During the late 1950s and 1960s, the non-tertiary branch of RMIT was reconstituted as the "Technical College" ([[TAFE]]), and it was believed the Institute and the College would eventually separate. However, the two have remained as incorporated branches of RMIT to the present day. During the 1960s, RMIT's Art School established its reputations as an Australian leader in its field.&lt;ref name="RMIT"/&gt;

In the 1970s and early 1980s, the Institute expanded its degrees in [[business]] and [[engineering]], and the College expanded its courses in [[technology]] and general studies. In 1979, the neighbouring [[Emily McPherson College of Domestic Economy]] on [[Russell Street, Melbourne|Russell Street]] amalgamated with RMIT, bringing with it its reputation in [[fashion design]] and [[food technology]].&lt;ref name="RMIT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time Line"/&gt; RMIT's Aeronautics School also established its reputation as an Australian leader in its field, during the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="RMIT"/&gt;

RMIT celebrated its [[centenary]] in 1987 with a year-long calendar of events staged across the City of [[Melbourne]], a [[time capsule]] set in the Bowen Street courtyard of the foundation building of the Working Men's College on [[La Trobe Street, Melbourne|La Trobe Street]] and a book called "''The Tech: A Centenary History of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology''", documenting the institute's 100 years of history, was also published.&lt;ref name="RMIT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time Line"/&gt;

In 1992, RMIT was granted [[public university]] status by the [[Parliament of Victoria]] under the "''Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology Act''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mams.rmit.edu.au/e06djrlyuhce1.pdf |title=Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology Act (1992) |access-date=2008-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910142748/http://mams.rmit.edu.au/e06djrlyuhce1.pdf |archive-date=2008-09-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; RMIT's newly appointed Chancellery officially adopted the names "'''RMIT University'''" for its Institute branch and "RMIT TAFE" for its College branch, during the early 1990s, and its Design School also established its reputation as an international leader in eco-friendly design.&lt;ref name="Time Line"/&gt;

Following its reconstitution as a public university, RMIT then underwent a large and rapid expansion where a number of other institutes and colleges became amalgamated with it, between 1993 and 1999, which included: Phillip Institute of Technology, Melbourne College of Decoration and Design, Melbourne College of Printing and Graphic Art and Melbourne Institute of Textiles.&lt;ref name="Time Line"/&gt;&lt;ref name=textiles&gt;[http://rmit.edu.au/browse/News%20and%20Events%2FNewsroom%2FNews%2Fby%20date%2F1998%2F;ID=922qcxpzsddq;STATUS=A RMIT affiliation with Melbourne Institute of Textiles]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - [http://www.rmit.edu.au/NEWS Openline (RMIT News)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802133921/http://www.rmit.edu.au/NEWS |date=2009-08-02 }}, 24 October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, RMIT acquired the neighbouring, and recently vacated, former [[Former Melbourne Magistrates' Court|Melbourne Magistrates' Court]] and City Watch House buildings on the corner of [[La Trobe Street, Melbourne|La Trobe Street]] and [[Russell Street, Melbourne|Russell Street]], and renamed its expanding campus in Melbourne the "[[RMIT City|City campus]]".&lt;ref name="Time Line"/&gt; It also established a new enivronmentally sustainable "country campus" around 20&amp;nbsp;km from the City campus, in [[Bundoora, Victoria|Bundoora]], which opened in 1995.

In 1999, it acquired the derelict state heritage-listed [[Capitol Theatre, Melbourne|Capitol Theatre]] in the [[Melbourne CBD]], and refurbished it to its original design. It also established a specialised [[fashion]] and [[printing]] campus in [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]], on the site of the former Melbourne Institute of Textiles in 1999, and became a founding member of the [[Australian Technology Network]], a coalition of leading Australian universities working with industry.&lt;ref name="Time Line"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ATN&gt;[http://www.atn.edu.au/ Australian Technology Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the century, RMIT was invited by the [[Politics of Vietnam|Government of Vietnam]] to establish [[Vietnam]]'s first foreign-owned university. In 2001, it established "[[RMIT University Vietnam|RMIT International University, Vietnam]]" (now RMIT University Vietnam) near the centre of [[Ho Chi Minh City]], and a second campus in the Vietnamese capital city of [[Hanoi]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="vietnam"&gt;[http://www.rmit.edu.vn/about-rmit-vietnam About RMIT Vietnam (RMIT Vietnam Homepage)]&lt;/ref&gt; In its years of operation, the Government of Vietnam has awarded RMIT University Vietnam five Golden Dragon Awards for Education.&lt;ref name=GoldenDragon&gt;[http://www.rmit.edu.vn/news.php?nid=193 RMIT Vietnam wins fifth consecutive Golden Dragon Award] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225100546/http://rmit.edu.vn/news.php?nid=193 |date=2008-12-25 }} - [http://www.rmit.edu.vn/listnews.php RMIT VN News] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026174204/http://www.rmit.edu.vn/listnews.php |date=2008-10-26 }}, 26 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-2000s, RMIT experienced financial problems, partly due to problems associated with its student administration system upgrade ([[Australian dollars|A$]]47 million was spent in this effort). The financial problems eventually claimed the then Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Ruth Dunkin. In 2005, RMIT appointed a new Vice-Chancellor, Prof. [[Margaret Gardner]] [[Order of Australia|AO]] and, between 2006 and 2007, posted operating profits of A$50.1 million and then A$109.5 million each year respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21655229-12332,00.html RMIT back in the black] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919072159/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21655229-12332,00.html |date=2008-09-19 }} - [[The Australian]], 2 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse;ID=zfq3tjbb7yyu RMIT records another year of expansion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424004726/http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse;ID=zfq3tjbb7yyu |date=2008-04-24 }} - [http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse;ID=nrv8rk31811 Openline (RMIT News)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026030838/http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse;ID=nrv8rk31811 |date=2008-10-26 }}, 18 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, it also became a founding member of the [[Global U8 Consortium]].&lt;ref name=GU8&gt;[http://site.inha.ac.kr/xelpa/users/u7/0_1.jsp Global U8 Consortium] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20070629181731/http://site.inha.ac.kr/xelpa/users/u7/0_1.jsp |date=2007-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Manning Hall.png|thumb|left|Manning Hall houses IAU’s School of Humanities and Social Sciences.]]
IAU was founded in 1957 by academics and former diplomats such as Dr. Herbert Maza, who also served as its first President.,&lt;ref name=SundayHeral1958Man&gt;{{cite news|title=Local Man Heads French Institute|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2229&amp;dat=19580406&amp;id=hWMmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KQAGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1384,271916&amp;hl=en|accessdate=4 May 2015|publisher=Sunday Herald|date=6 April 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Evron Kirkpatrick, Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, and others who wanted to provide a platform for Americans interested in studying diplomatic relations with related interests and careers in the foreign service and the State Department.  It was founded under the authority of [[Aix-Marseille University]] and offered a study abroad program, providing for transfer credit to those willing to live and study in France for one year.&lt;ref name=SundayHeral1958Man/&gt; With its inception, it became the first institution to offer study abroad programs to students with majors other than language.&lt;ref name=AAICUIFAU/&gt;

By 1966 the Institute had an enrollment of approximately 150 students&lt;ref name=HeralJrouGirls&gt;{{cite news|title=Overseas Study Benefits Invaluable, Girls Assert|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19660206&amp;id=Yn4sAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A80EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4785,647962&amp;hl=en|accessdate=4 May 2015|publisher=Herald-Journal|date=6 February 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1976 it incorporated The Marchutz School of Fine Arts (founded by [[Leo Marchutz]]) into the program. The program grew and as of 2015 has served more than 700 colleges and universities with over 20,000 undergraduates, and an annual enrollment of over 700.&lt;ref name=IAUMissionHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=History of IAU|url=https://www.iaufrance.org/about/mission|website=IAU College official website|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Institute of Rural Management''' (IRM) is a capacity development and learning facility in the not-for-profit sector of Pakistan. Over the last 25 years, IRM has been directly responsible for building the capacity of development professionals and communities across Pakistan, as well as working with most UN agencies, [[USAID]], DFID and Federal and provincial government. IRM is ranked at 187th amongst the Top 500 NGOs by the NGO Advisor for year 2016.

IRM has a Head office in [[Islamabad]] and 40 sub offices in all four provinces of Pakistan.

==History==

IRM was established as a one-room human resource development organization under the patronage of National Rural Support Programme in 1992 with the mission is to eradicate poverty, reduce inequality and improve the quality of life of the rural communities by empowering them to harness their true human, social and economic potential through vocational and technical training.

In 2010, IRM was registered as a separate legal entity and underwent several strategic transformations. Roomi S. Hayat was appointed as first chief executive officer of the IRM. Under his leadership, IRM evolved into a substantial training institute, having trained more than 1&amp;nbsp;million people  with an annual turnout of over 50,000 trainees.

'''Instructional animations''' are [[animation]]s that are used either to provide instructions for immediate performance of a task or to support more permanent [[education|learning]] of subject matter. While both of these uses can be described as instructional animations, when the goal is to support learning, the term [[educational animation]] may be preferred.

'''Ivan Illich''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|v|ɑː|n|_|ˈ|ɪ|l|ɪ|tʃ}}; 4 September 1926 &amp;ndash; 2 December 2002) was a Croatian-Austrian [[philosopher]], [[Roman Catholic]] priest, and critic of the institutions of modern [[Western culture]], who addressed contemporary practices in education, medicine, work, energy use, transportation, and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ivan-Illich|title=Ivan Illich - Austrian philosopher and priest|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/ivan-illich Enciclopedia Treccani]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ca}} [https://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0033489.xml Gran Encyclopedia Catalana]&lt;/ref&gt; The book that brought Ivan Illich to public attention was ''[[Deschooling Society]]'' published in 1971. It was a groundbreaking critique of compulsory [[mass education]]. He argued that the oppressive structure of the school system could not be reformed but must be dismantled in order to free humanity from the crippling effects of lifelong [[institutionalization]].

== Life and career ==
Illich was born in Vienna to a [[Croatia]]n Catholic father, engineer Ivan Peter Illich, and a [[Sephardic Jewish]] mother, Ellen née Regenstreif-Ortlieb.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hansom|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandmother was from [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1415202/Ivan-Illich.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Ivan Illich | date=December 5, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illich spoke Italian, Spanish, French, and German fluently.&lt;ref name=Diplo&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paquot |first=Thierry |url=http://mondediplo.com/2003/01/15illich |title=The Non-Conformist |magazine=[[Le Monde diplomatique]] |date=January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2003/01/PAQUOT/9866|title=La résistance selon Ivan Illich|date=1 January 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeansocialecologyinstitute.org/site/news/obit/illich.html|title=BLUE: OBITUARY - Ivan Illich|first=Tim|last=Barton|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later learned [[Croatian language|Croatian]], the language of his grandfathers, then Ancient Greek and Latin, in addition to Portuguese, Hindi, English, and other languages.&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt; He studied [[histology]] and [[crystallography]] at the [[University of Florence]] (Italy) as well as [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]] (from 1942 to 1946), and medieval history in [[Salzburg]].&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt;

He wrote a dissertation focusing on the historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] and would return to that subject in his later years. In 1951, he "signed up to become a parish priest in one of New York's poorest neighborhoods—[[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], on the northern tip of Manhattan, at that time a barrio of newly-arrived [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican immigrants]]."&lt;ref name=Madar&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Madar |first1=Chase |title=The People's Priest |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-peoples-priest/ |work=The American Conservative |date=1 February 2010 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, at the age of 30, he was appointed vice rector of the [[Catholic University of Puerto Rico]], "a position he managed to keep for several years before getting thrown out—Illich was just a little too loud in his criticism of the Vatican's pronouncements on [[birth control]] and comparatively demure silence about [[Nuclear weapon|the bomb]]."&lt;ref name=Madar/&gt; It was in [[Puerto Rico]] that Illich met [[Everett Reimer]] and the two began to analyze their own functions as "educational" leaders. In 1959, he traveled throughout South America on foot and by bus.&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt;

The end of Illich's tenure at the university came in 1960 as the result of a controversy involving Bishops [[James Edward McManus]] and [[James Peter Davis]], who had denounced [[Luis Muñoz Marín|Governor Luis Muñoz Marín]] and his Popular Democratic Party for their positions in favor of birth control and divorce. The bishops also started their own rival Catholic party.&lt;ref name=Hartch&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartch|first1=Todd|title=The Prophet of Cuernavaca: Ivan Illich and the Crisis of the West|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190204563|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illich later summarized his opposition thusly:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a historian, I saw that it violated the American tradition of Church and State separation. As a politician, I predicted that there wasn't enough strength in Catholic ranks to create a meaningful platform and that failure of McManus's party would be disastrous on the already frail prestige of the Puerto Rican Church. As a theologian, I believe that the Church must always condemn injustice in the light of the Gospel, but never has the right to speak in favor of a specific political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Francine du Plessix|title=Divine Disobedience: Profiles in Catholic Radicalism|date=1970|publisher=Knopf|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After Illich disobeyed a direct order from McManus forbidding all priests from dining with Governor Muñoz, the bishop ordered Illich to leave his post at the university, referring to his very presence as "dangerous to the Diocese of Ponce and its institutions."&lt;ref name=Hartch/&gt;

Despite this display of insubordination and an order from [[Paul Tanner|Paul Francis Tanner]], then general secretary of the [[National Catholic Welfare Conference]], forbidding Illich from any official role in the organization's Latin American bureau, Illich maintained the support of the influential priest John J. Considine, who continued to push for Illich to have a role in training the Church's missionaries, personally funding trips to Mexico in order for Illich to scout locations.&lt;ref name=Hartch/&gt;

In 1961, Illich founded the [[Centro Intercultural de Documentación]] (CIDOC, or Intercultural Documentation Center) at [[Cuernavaca]] in Mexico, ostensibly a research center offering language courses to missionaries from North America and volunteers of the [[Alliance for Progress]] program&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt; initiated by [[John F. Kennedy]]. His real intent was to document the participation of the Vatican in the "modern development" of the so-called [[Third World]]. Illich looked askance at the liberal pity or conservative imperiousness that motivated the rising tide of global industrial development. He viewed such emissaries as a form of industrial hegemony and, as such, an act of "war on subsistence". He sought to teach missionaries dispatched by the Church not to impose their own cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|du Plessix Gray|1970|pp=44 &amp; 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Throughout the late '60s and early '70s, CIDOC was part language school and part free university for intellectuals from all over the Americas."&lt;ref name=Madar/&gt;

At the CIDOC, "Illich was able to develop his potent and highly influential critique of Third World development schemes and their fresh-faced agents: Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, the [[Peace Corps]], and countless other missionary efforts bankrolled and organized by wealthy nations, foundations, and religious groups."&lt;ref name=Madar/&gt; After ten years, critical analysis from the CIDOC of the institutional actions by the Church brought the organization into conflict with the Vatican. Unpopular with the local chapter of [[Opus Dei]],&lt;ref name=Madar/&gt; Illich was called to Rome for questioning, due in part to a [[CIA]] report.&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt; In 1976, Illich, apparently concerned by the influx of formal academics and the potential side effects of its own "institutionalization", shut the center down with consent from the other members of the CIDOC. Several of the members subsequently continued language schools in Cuernavaca, of which some still exist. Illich himself resigned from the active priesthood in the late-1960s (having attained the rank of [[monsignor]]), but continued to identify as a priest and occasionally performed private [[Mass (liturgy)|masses]].

In the 1970s, Illich was popular among leftist intellectuals in France, his thesis having been discussed in particular by [[André Gorz]]. However, his influence declined after the [[French presidential election, 1981|1981 election]] of [[François Mitterrand]] as Illich was considered too pessimistic at a time when the [[French Left]] took control of the government.&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt;

In the 1980s and beyond, Illich traveled extensively, mainly splitting his time between the United States, Mexico, and Germany. He held an appointment as a Visiting Professor of Philosophy, Science, Technology and Society at [[Penn State]]. He also taught at the [[University of Bremen]] and [[University of Hagen]].&lt;ref&gt;Illich, Ivan (1999). [http://www.ecobooks.com/books/deschooling.htm "Editorial - 'Deschooling Society by Ivan Illich']. [[Marion Boyars Publishers]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; During his last days of his life he admitted that he was greatly influenced by one of the Indian economists and adviser to M.&amp;nbsp;K. Gandhi, [[J.&amp;nbsp;C. Kumarappa]], most notably, his book, ''Economy of Permanence''.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Victus, Jesus and Mother Economy: An Introduction to the Theology of J.C.Kumarappa, New Delhi: ISPCK, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Illich never referred to himself as an anarchist in print, he was closely associated with major figures in left-anarchist circles, notably [[Paul Goodman]] and unschooling advocate [[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]]. Goodman is credited in ''[[Deschooling Society]]'' with having "radically obliged" Illich to revise his thinking, and described with great affection in Illich's 1990s interviews with [[David Cayley]]:

{{quote|... I loved Goodman very much, but not from the beginning. In 1951, as a twenty-six-year-old man newly arrived in New York, I went to a public debate. This strange person arrived and fascinated everybody with his way of presenting himself. I was just then having my first experiences of sitting through cold turkey with neighbourhood kids from Washington Heights, and this guy carefully phrased his proposal that New York ''immediately'' decriminalize all substances you can ingest, because otherwise the city of New York would become an unlivable city within the next few years. He had recently played a major part in getting a law passed which recognized that the state should not interfere with the private activities of consenting adults.

Well, I was shocked! I would not have suspected that within three of four years we would be good friends and that during the last part of his life he would spend considerable time with me in Cuernavaca. I consider Goodman one of the great thinkers I've known, and also a tender, touching person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cayley |first1=David |title=Ivan Illich in Conversation |date=1992 |publisher=[[House of Anansi Press]] |isbn=9780887845246 |pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Death==
Illich died 2 December 2002 in Bremen, Germany. His last wish, to die surrounded by close collaborators amid the genesis of a new learning centre he had planned in Bologna, was not realised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Todd|first1=Andrew|last2=La Cecla|first2=Franco|title=Ivan Illich|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/dec/09/guardianobituaries.highereducation|accessdate=11 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=2002-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Deschooling Society''==
{{main|Deschooling Society}}

The book that brought Ivan Illich to public attention was ''[[Deschooling Society]]'' (1971), a radical critical discourse on education as practised in "modern" economies. Giving examples of what he regards as the ineffectual nature of institutionalized education, Illich posited self-directed education, supported by intentional social relations, in fluid informal arrangements:

{{quote|Universal education through schooling is not feasible. It would be no more feasible if it were attempted by means of alternative institutions built on the style of present schools. Neither new attitudes of teachers toward their pupils nor the proliferation of educational hardware or software (in classroom or bedroom), nor finally the attempt to expand the pedagogue's responsibility until it engulfs his pupils' lifetimes will deliver universal education. The current search for new educational ''funnels'' must be reversed into the search for their institutional inverse: educational ''webs'' which heighten the opportunity for each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring. We hope to contribute concepts needed by those who conduct such counterfoil research on education--and also to those who seek alternatives to other established service industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecotopia.com/webpress/deschooling.htm|title=Deschooling Society, by Ivan Illich|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The last sentence makes clear what the title suggests—that the institutionalization of education tends towards the institutionalization of society and that ideas for de-institutionalizing education may be a starting point for a de-institutionalized society.

The book is more than a critique—it contains suggestions for a reinvention of learning throughout society and lifetime. Particularly striking is his call (in 1971) for the use of advanced technology to support "learning webs":

{{quote|The operation of a peer-matching network would be simple. The user would identify himself by name and address and describe the activity for which he sought a peer. A computer would send him back the names and addresses of all those who had inserted the same description. It is amazing that such a simple utility has never been used on a broad scale for publicly valued activity.}}

According to a contemporary review in ''[[The Libertarian Forum]]'', "Illich's advocacy of the [[free market]] in education is the bone in the throat that is choking the public educators."&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Liggio|Liggio, Leonard]] [https://mises.org/daily/4077 "Disestablish Public Education"], ''[[The Libertarian Forum]]'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; Since Illich's opposition was not merely to publicly funded schooling, as with the libertarians, but to schooling as such; the disestablishment of schools was for him not a means to a free market in educational services, but a deschooled society, which was a more fundamental shift. As he later asserted in ''After Deschooling, What?'' (1973): 'We can disestablish schools, or we can deschool culture'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Illich|first=Ivan|title=After deschooling, what?|year=1976|publisher=Writers and Readers Pub. Cooperative|location=London|isbn=0-904613-36-4|page=48|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He actually opposed advocates of free-market education as "the most dangerous category of educational reformers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Illich|first=Ivan|title=Toward a history of needs|year=1977|publisher=Heyday Books|location=Berkley|isbn=978-0-930588-26-7|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Tools for Conviviality''==
{{main|Tools for Conviviality}}
''[[Tools for Conviviality]]'' (1973) was published only two years after ''Deschooling Society''.  In this new work Illich generalized the themes that he had previously applied to the field of education: the institutionalization of specialized knowledge, the dominant role of [[technocratic]] elites in industrial society, and the need to develop new instruments for the reconquest of practical knowledge by the average citizen. He wrote that "[e]lite professional groups ... have come to exert a 'radical [[monopoly]]' on such basic human activities as health, agriculture, home-building, and learning, leading to a 'war on subsistence' that robs peasant societies of their vital skills and know-how. The result of much economic development is very often not human flourishing but 'modernized poverty', dependency, and an out-of-control system in which the humans become worn-down mechanical parts."&lt;ref name=Madar/&gt; Illich proposed that we should "invert the present deep structure of tools" in order to "give people tools that guarantee their right to work with independent efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Illich|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tools for Conviviality'' attracted worldwide attention. A résumé of it was published by French social philosopher [[André Gorz]] in ''[[Les Temps Modernes]]'', under the title "Freeing the Future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techno-science.net/?onglet=glossaire&amp;definition=1048 |title=Définition André Gorz |publisher=Encyclopédie scientifique en ligne |work=techno-science.net |language=FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's vision of tools that would be developed and maintained by a community of users had a significant influence on the first developers of the [[personal computer]], notably [[Lee Felsenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Convivial Cybernetic Devices, From Vacuum Tube Flip-Flops to the Singing Altair, An Interview with Lee Felsenstein (Part 1) |journal=The Analytical Engine |publisher=Computer History Association of California |issn=1071-6351 |volume=3 |issue=1 |date=November 1995 |url=http://opencollector.org/history/homebrew/engv3n1.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050825165932/http://opencollector.org/history/homebrew/engv3n1.html |archivedate=2005-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Medical Nemesis''==
In his ''Medical Nemesis'', first published in 1975, also known as ''Limits to Medicine'', Illich subjected contemporary Western medicine to detailed attack. He argued that the [[medicalization]] in recent decades of so many of life's vicissitudes—birth and death, for example—frequently caused more harm than good and rendered many people in effect lifelong patients. He marshalled a body of statistics to show what he considered the shocking extent of post-operative side-effects and drug-induced illness in advanced industrial society. He introduced to a wider public the notion of [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenic disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Illich|1974b}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been scientifically established a century earlier by British nurse [[Florence Nightingale]] (1820–1910). Others have since voiced similar views.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Postman|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''To Hell with Good Intentions''==
In his speech of 1968 to the Conference on InterAmerican Student Projects (CIASP), Illich strongly opposes the presence of American missionaries in Mexico. Illich says that the presence of American's "do-gooders" is causing more harm than good. Rather, he suggests that the Americans should stay completely away from Latin America and stay in their homeland where they can at least know what they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;Illich, Ivan.

He subsequently took up the post of Dean of the newly created Faculty of Health and Social Work at [[Anglia Polytechnic University]] from 1989 until 1996, where his wife, Cynthia, worked as a lecturer in pre-registration nursing. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

He was made an Emeritus Professor on retirement in 1996, and then devoted his time to the charitable activities of Disability Croydon, Nurses Fund for Nurses and the [[Nigerian]] Council of Elders, and served as a local education authority (LEA) governor of two schools in [[Croydon]].

==Personal life==
He had been involved in the [[Nursing Council of Nigeria]] and he was a fellow of the UK [[Royal College of Nursing]] (FRCN).

== International rankings ==
These are the universities' rankings in 2015 according to THE (Times Higher Education) and QS (Quacquarelli Symonds).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studyabroad.careers360.com/articles/top-universities-in-uae-2015 Top Universities in UAE  2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

These rankings are now out of date and do not include the THE 2016 or 2017 updates. Definitions of categories used for measurement of both THE and QS are missing. It would be helpful if the UAE provided its own rankings according to its own measurement system. The Tuning Project 2000 is integrated in the THE rankings in order to accommodate local and cultural diversity and to ameliorate against rankings with 'Western' bias.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4983">'''Margaret Hayman''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|FIMA}} (1923–1994, born '''Margaret Riley Crann''') was a British [[mathematics education|mathematics educator]] who co-founded the [[British Mathematical Olympiad]], wrote mathematics textbooks, and became president of the [[Mathematical Association]].

==Life==
Margaret Riley Crann was born on 7 August 1923 in [[New Earswick]] in [[North Yorkshire]], where her father Thomas Crann was a research chemist and her mother a teacher; she grew up as a [[Quakers|Quaker]]. After studying at the [[Millthorpe School|Mill Mount School]] in York,
she read mathematics and then geography in [[Newnham College, Cambridge]], and earned a master's degree from the [[University of Cambridge]], beginning in 1941 and finishing in 1944. She became a social worker in Birmingham for a year before taking a position as a mathematics teacher at [[Putney High School]], a girls' school in London where she eventually became head of mathematics.{{r|trust|mlaf|times}}

In 1947, she married mathematician [[Walter Hayman]].{{r|mactutor|times}}
He writes that they met at the [[Jesus Lane]] [[Quakers|Friends Meeting House]] in Cambridge, in her first and his third year at Cambridge, and that they fell in love after she hit him with a celery stick for making a pun.{{r|mlaf}} Beyond her professional interests, she was also an amateur violinist.{{r|mlaf|times}}

She retired from Putney High School in 1985, and returned with her husband to Yorkshire.{{r|mlaf}} She died on 26 July 1994.{{r|trust|obit}}

==Contributions==
In 1966, Hayman and her husband founded the British Mathematical Olympiad. Hayman took an active part in the meetings of proponents of the competition, helped negotiate the role of the British Olympiad in the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]], and fought for funding for the competition and for the good will of the Mathematical Association towards the competition.{{r|times|obit}}

She taught master classes in mathematics teaching for the [[Royal Institution]],{{r|times}} and became the author of mathematical textbooks,{{r|trust}} including:
*''Multiple Choice Modern Mathematics'' (Nelson, 1969){{r|lockwood}}
*''Essential Mathematics'' (Macmillan 1971){{r|bolt|fowlie}}

She became president of the Mathematical Association for the 1974–1975 term,{{r|obit|pres}} and a member of the council of the [[Institute of Mathematics and its Applications]]. Her philosophy as president of the Mathematical Association involved keeping the mathematics curriculum flexible enough to ensure that all pupils received a mathematical education fitting their individual needs.{{r|obit}}

'''The Master of Science in [[Marketing]]''' (or '''MS Marketing''') is a [[graduate degree]] that prepares the student to work in [[middle-management]]-and-above marketing positions.  The specific field within marketing will depend on the student, their program, and the firm with which they will work.  Fields may include [[brand management]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rauschnabel|first=Philipp A.|last2=Krey|first2=Nina|last3=Babin|first3=Barry J.|last4=Ivens|first4=Bjoern S.|date=2016-08-01|title=Brand management in higher education: The University Brand Personality Scale|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296316000369|journal=Journal of Business Research|volume=69|issue=8|pages=3077–3086|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.01.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[digital marketing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wymbs|first=Cliff|year=2011|title=Digital Marketing: The Time for a New "Academic Major" Has Arrived|url=|journal=Journal of Marketing Education|volume=1–14|pages=14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; integrated marketing communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/036381119190020L?via=ihub|title=Integrated marketing communications: A new master's degree concept |language=en|access-date=2017-03-29|doi=10.1016/0363-8111(91)90020-L|volume=17|journal=Public Relations Review|pages=237–244 | last1 = Caywood | first1 = Clarke}}&lt;/ref&gt; marketing [[analytics]] and [[research]], [[marketing strategy]], [[pricing strategy]] and many others.
 
The key difference between the MS Marketing degree and the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) degree is the required number of marketing courses in the degree.  Typically the MBA degree may have a concentration in marketing or other fields of 4-6 courses.  The MS Marketing degree will usually have 10-12 marketing courses.  The MBA will offer courses in [[accounting]], [[finance]], [[business]] strategy, marketing, organizational behavior and other general business courses in much less depth than a specialized degree&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laud|first=Robert L.|last2=Johnson|first2=Matthew S.|date=2013-03-01|title=Progress and Regress in the MBA Curriculum: The Career and Practice Skills Gap|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15416518.2013.781398|journal=Organization Management Journal|volume=10|issue=1|pages=24–35|doi=10.1080/15416518.2013.781398}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the MS Marketing degree that requires marketing courses, supplemented with perhaps a few [[electives]] in other areas such as analytics.

In the background, the movement was motivated by the global [[Protests of 1968]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallerstein|first=Emmanuel|date=1989|title=1968: revolución en el sistema-mundo. Tesis e interrogantes|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40420017|journal=Estudios Sociológicos|volume=7|issue=20|pages=229–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; and struggled for a democratic change in the country, more political and [[civil liberties]], the reduction of inequality and the resignation of the government of the ruling [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) that they considered authoritarian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The movement aroused from July–October 1968 in the context of the buildup to the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]] and the worldwide protests that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico's 1968 Massacre: What Really Happened?|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97546687|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="99percent"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trufelman|first1=Avery|title=Mexico 68|url=http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/mexico-68/|website=99% Invisible|accessdate=14 July 2017|date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the movement was permanently repressed by the government and finally tried to annihilate on the [[Tlatelolco massacre]] on [[October 2]], 1968. The massacre was planned and executed under the code name [[Operation Galeana]], by the paramilitary group called [[Olimpia Battalion]], the Federal Security Direction (DFS), then the so-called Secret Police and the [[Mexican Army]] simulating a shooting in the [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas]] after the conclusion of a concentration of the CNH. One year after, in [[1969]], president [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz]] –also a CIA's informer assumed the responsibility of the massacre.

Twenty two years after the Government of Mexico created a [[Special Prosecutor for the Social and Political Movements of the Past]] (FEMOSSP, in Spanish) which published several conclusions in an [[Historical Inform to the Society|''Historical Inform to the Society'']]''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'' after the reopening of the case and concluded that the movement marked an inflection "in the political times of Mexico", and was "independent, rebellious and close to the civil resistance" this last recognized officially as false the main argument of the Diaz Ordaz's official version that the reason behind the movement was the pretension of the installation of a Communist regime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With this argument the mexican government justified a strategy to combat the movement and characterizing it as a foreign risk with terrorists pretensions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In that order the Mexican Government planned and ordered an extermination campaign during the months of the movement and after based on a massive strategy of [[Human rights violations|Human Rights violations]] as [[false imprisonment]]s, [[abuse]]s, [[torture]], [[persecution]], [[espionage]], [[criminalization]]; also crimes as [[forced disappearance]]s, [[homicide]]s and [[extrajudicial killing]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/1968-los-archivos-de-la-violencia/oclc/469276082&amp;referer=brief_results|title=1968: los archivos de la violencia (1968: the violence files)|last=Aguayo|first=Sergio|date=1999|publisher=Grijalbo : Reforma|year=|isbn=9700510263|location=Mexico|pages=|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; All along this period the Mexican Government had an active advising, presence and intelligence operations of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] of the United States''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'' under the undercovered [[Operation LITEMPO]] including having Diaz Ordaz and other high representatives of the Mexican Government as informants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//NSAEBB/NSAEBB204/index2.htm|title=LITEMPO: Los ojos de la CIA en Tlatelolco (Litempo: the CIA's eyes on Tlatelolco)|last=Jefferson|first=Morley|date=2006-10-18|website=National Security Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=ecBiXwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Nuestro hombre en México: Winston Scott y la historia oculta de la CIA|last=Morley|first=Jefferson|date=2011|publisher=Santillana USA Publishing Company Incorporated|isbn=9786071108883|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of victims, disappeared and imprisoned is still imprecise''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;''.

Some victims of the Tlatelolco massacre tried to sue the October 2 killings on national and international courts as a [[Crimes against humanity|crime against humanity]] and a [[genocide]], affirmation that was sustained by FEMOSPP but rejected by its courts. Some political scientists, historians and intellectuals like [[Carlos Monsiváis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/68-la-tradicion-de-la-resistencia/oclc/301408298&amp;referer=brief_results|title=El 68: la tradición de la resistencia (The 68: the resistance tradition)|last=Monsiváis|first=Carlos|date=2008|publisher=Ediciones Era|year=|isbn=6074450013|location=México, D.F.|pages=|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; agreed in pointing out that this movement and its conclusion incited a permanent and more active critical and oppositional attitude of civil society, mainly in public universities. As well provoked the radicalization of some survivor activists who opted for clandestinity and formed urban and rural guerrillas, which were repressed in the so-called [[Dirty War (Mexico)|Dirty War]] on the 70s.

==Origins==

For several years prior to the protests, Mexico had experienced a period of strong economic performance called the [[Mexican miracle]].  The government wanted to showcase this progress to the world during the Olympics.  However, the economic growth hadn't been spread evenly, and students saw an opportunity to bring reforms and more democracy to Mexico.&lt;ref name="99percent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="swarthmore"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexican students protest for greater democracy, 1968|url=http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/mexican-students-protest-greater-democracy-1968|website=Global Nonviolent Action Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Arising from reaction to the government's violent repression of fights between rival ''porros'' (gangs), the student movement in Mexico City quickly grew to include large segments of the student body who were dissatisfied with the regime of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]].&lt;ref&gt;""La democracia, punto de unión universal entre quienes animamos ese movimiento, se vuelve un espejismo cuando nos acercamos tratando de precisar su contenido." See Sergio Zermeño, ''México, una democracia utópica: El movimiento estudiantil del 68'', 5th Edition (Mexico City: Siglo Veitiuno, 1985), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1968 [[Olympic Games]] took place in Mexico, making it the first developing country to host this event. This represented an important source of income to the country because of the tourists who would come to attend the Olympics. Giving a good impression to the world could lead to the introduction of international investors. However the students were against these ideals. They did not believe that the appearance of Mexico to the world was a priority. They preferred a revolution resulting in the reformation of their country. "No queremos Olimpiadas, queremos revolución" (We do not want Olympic Games, we want a revolution).&lt;ref name="op2"&gt;{{Cite news|last = Ponitowska|first = Elena|title = Son cuerpos, señor…|newspaper = Equis|pages = 3–8|date=  September 1998|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IOC threatened to move the Games to Los Angeles if the situation deteriorated.&lt;ref name="Xypolia 2013 33"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keele.ac.uk/journal-globalfaultlines/publications/geziReflections.pdf|title=Turmoils and Economic Miracles: Turkey '13 and Mexico '68|last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|year=2013|editor=Gokay, Bulent|editor2=Xypolia, Ilia|publisher=Keele European Research Centre|location=Keele, UK|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="op2"&gt;{{Cite news|last = Ponitowska|first = Elena|title = Son cuerpos, señor…|newspaper = Equis|pages = 3–8|date=  September 1998|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests==

Protests took place throughout 1968, and were often violently stopped by police.&lt;ref name="99percent" /&gt;

===Silence March===

The Silence March was a silent demonstration that took place on September 13, meant to prove that the movement was not a series of riots but had discipline and self-control.&lt;ref name="Poniatowska 1991"&gt;Poniatowska, Elena. ''Massacre in Mexico'', trans. Helen R. Lane Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tlatelolco massacre===
{{main|Tlatelolco massacre}}
From July to September 1968, student movements started to arise and become stronger, to the point that the government began aggressively intervening. {{citation needed|date=December 2007}} On October 2, 1968, at 5 PM in the [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas]] in [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]], a neighborhood of Mexico City, almost 10 thousand men, women and children stood waiting for a meeting to start. However, when the leaders of the several student organizations and movements arrived, policemen and the military, sent by president [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz|Díaz Ordaz]] and commanded by [[Luis Echeverria]], decided to dissolve the meeting. A student claims that at about 6:10 a helicopter dropped three flares over the plaza, quickly followed by the first gunshots. Students were kidnapped,
tortured, and terrorized by the government.&lt;ref name="op3"&gt;{{cite web|last=González |first=Víctor M. |title=México 1968…¡No se olvida! |publisher=Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Occidente |date=June 2003 |url=http://iteso.mx/~victorm/Mexico_1968.html |accessdate=2007-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103072803/http://iteso.mx/~victorm/Mexico_1968.html |archivedate=November 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/v/OBu8o6AlQlA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1 Youtube footage in which flare drop is visible.] Footage was recorded secretly by the government on the day of the massacre. See: [http://www.radiodiaries.org/audiohistory/storypages/mexico.html Radiodiaries.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

This social movement brought unavoidable consequences which permanently changed the future of Mexico,&lt;ref name="Xypolia 2013 33"/&gt; but these political and social changes were not immediate, the repression continued with the [[Corpus Christi massacre]] in 1971.

The major change caused by this movement came at a political level. The citizens had the opportunity to live a new democracy in which their opinion could actually bring change in society. People no longer trusted completely in the government and would no longer live completely under the conscious control of their government, nor tolerate it anymore,&lt;ref name="op3"/&gt; although they were not completely free. [[Octavio Paz]] resigned from the Indian embassy as an act of protest against the government's harsh repression of the student movements. However, there were also some older intellectuals who were in favor of the government, like [[Agustín Yañez]].&lt;ref name="op2"/&gt;

'''Montessori in India''' became popularised when [[Maria Montessori]], founder of the [[Montessori method]], was forced to stay in [[India]] during [[World War II]].

==History==
[[Maria Montessori|Maria Montessori's]] work in [[India]] began with her arrival there in 1939, and continued through her representatives, Joosten and Swamy, before spreading further. In 1939, the [[Theosophical Society of India]] extended an invitation to the 69-year-old Montessori. She accepted the invitation and reached India the same year. She made [[Adyar, Chennai]] her home and lived there along with her son, Mario. The famous Montessorians, Gool Minwala, Tehmina Wadia and Khurshed Taraporewala were the students in the first training at Adyar.

In 1940, when India entered [[World War II]], Montessori and her son were interned as [[enemy alien]]s in India, but Maria was allowed to conduct training courses. Sixteen courses were conducted during this time, creating a very strong base for the method here. She also had her own school in [[Kodaikanal]] for this duration. In 1947, she went back to [[Europe]] for a brief period. Montessori returned to India for a second time the same year to conduct a few more courses in [[Chennai]], [[Pune]], [[Ahmedabad]] and [[Karachi]]. The Montessoris then returned to Europe, leaving A.M. Joosten as their representative in India. Montessori died in 1952 at the age of 81 years.

==Indian Montessori Training Courses (IMTC)==
To create an official structure for Joosten's work, an organisation was created by the name of Indian Montessori Training Courses (IMTC) in 1949. It was an organisation consisting mainly of Joosten and Swamy. This travelling institution moved from city to city until Swamy's retirement in 1990. Ex-students from previous trainings working in the locality were called upon to be assistants. After Swamy's retirement, IMTC ran under the Directorship of Meenakshi Shivaramakrishnan. IMTC was now based in Bangalore. By the next decade, new branches were created at Chennai under the name CMTC.

==Indian Institute for Montessori Studies (IIMS)==
Indian Montessori Center invited Rajendra Gupta to conduct a primary Montessori training at Bangalore in 1996. This was the first such course to be conducted in India after Montessori left the country. However, IMC discontinued the course after this year. To preserve the method thereafter, Rajendra Gupta set up Indian Institute for Montessori Studies with himself as the Director, Radha Nagaraj as the co-Director, with the help of a few of his students. IIMS continues to be a rarity where the work is carried out by a committee rather than an individual, adding more faculty over the years.

== Indian Montessori Foundation (IMF) ==
At present, there are four AMI Montessori centres in India: Bangalore, Chennai, Hydrebad and Mumbai.

==Other Primary Montessori training courses==
After the popularising of the Primary Montessori Training by IIMS, several schools offering this method at the primary level came up in Bangalore, Tumkur, Chennai and Trichy. This has encouraged other pre-primary based institutions to branch out into this area. Both IMTC and Navadisha Montessori Institute have offered primary Montessori training from time to time.

==People behind the Montessori movement in India==
It has taken many years' work by many to make Montessori method popular in India. In one city, Bangalore itself, the number of such schools has increased from six in 1990 to more than a hundred. This growth of the movement was sustained by the following people and their students, who held it together with their personal efforts and charisma.

===A.M. Joosten===
[[File:Amjoosten.gif|right|thumb|Albert Joosten]]
Albert Joosten, a renowned Montessori trainer, was trained by Montessori in 1934. He worked in Montessori schools (pre-primary and elementary) in Berlin, Amsterdam, London and Laren (Netherlands) and assisted Maria and Mario Montessori and at International Montessori Training Courses and Conferences all over Europe. In 1949, he was appointed Director of the Indian Montessori Training Courses, India, Joosten co-founded the Good Shepherd Maria Montessori Training Center at Colombo (Sri Lanka) in 1957. In 1973, he was appointed, on behalf of the Association Montessori International, Director of the Montessori Training Center of Minnesota, U.S.A. He was the director of all these training centers until his death in 1980. Joosten conducted workshops and lectures in India, the U.S.A., Canada and several European countries and was speaker at several International Montessori Conference in Europe and the U.S.A. He translated and cooperated with the translation of several of Montessori's books in English, Dutch, German and Portuguese. He continued to be the Director of IMTC till his demise in 1980.

===S. R. Swamy===
S. R. Swamy took Montessori training with Montessori at Kodaikanal. He worked in various schools in India until 1951. He was first Assistant to Joosten and a trainer at the Indian Montessori Training Courses from 1951 to 1980. He became the Director of the training from 1980 to 1990.

===Meenakshi Shivaramakrishnan===
To read about her, please look below under the See also section

===Rajendra K. Gupta===
Gupta took his Montessori pre-primary training with Joosten in India in 1953 on the recommendation of the headmaster of the school in which he was working at Muzzafarnagar. After working for several years at his old school and at the AMI school of Gwalior, he moved to Delhi. When Joosten conducted his 6th – 8th course in Delhi, Gupta acted as his assistant. His wife, Urmila Gupta also took her training at this period and joined him in his work for nearly a decade. When the Birth Centenary celebrations of Montessori was organised in New Delhi, he was in charge. A postage stamp was released on the occasion. V. V. Giri, President of India, presided over the function. Two years later, he left for US. Gupta stayed in touch with Joosten until his death in 1980, even visiting him during the latter’s visit to Minnesota.
Gupta took his elementary training with Margaret Stevenson in the USA in 1978. Later he completed his Master of Education degree from Century University, New Mexico, USA. He worked in AMI Montessori Houses of Children for about 20 years in India and the USA and in AMI elementary Montessori Schools for 25 years in the USA.
Gupta was a Montessori trainer for both pre-primary and primary levels with the Southwest Montessori Training Center, Denton, Texas, USA for about ten years. He also gave orientation courses in Montessori Education at the College of St Scholastica, Duluth, Minnesota, and at the Chicago Community College, Illinois, USA. He was an Adjunct Professor with the University of Texas A &amp; I, Kingsville, Texas, USA where he gave a pre-primary Montessori course to the Master of Education students. Mr. Gupta gave workshops in India as well as in the USA on various subjects during 45 years of his teaching career. He has written manuals for Montessori teachers in the areas of botany, zoology, and language, and published classroom materials on science, language, botany, zoology, and history. He has also published books written by Albert Joosten and other Montessorians. Currently he is the Director of the Indian Institute for Montessori Studies which is conducting Pre-primary cum Elementary course in Bangalore, India.

===Radha Nagaraj===
Radha Nagaraj was a product of the infant Montessori school at Hymamshu. She took her pre-primary Montessori training from Joosten and Swamy in 1967–68 at the behest of the then Director, Sundaramma. She also set up a new Montessori at Mahila Mandali and worked there under the guidance of Swamy for ten years.
Joosten came to Bangalore in 1978. Radha Nagaraj acted as his assistant for two years. She continued to work in Mahila Mandali since then as a Director. She took up assistance at IMTC from 1997 under Swamy, and continued to work there till 2002. She also handled the training in Kannada till 2004. The post of the co-Director of the pre-primary-cum-primary course at IIMS became hers in 2000, which continues to be hers till now.
Radhaji has presented papers at the seminars organized by the Indian Montessori Center at Bangalore and at the celebration of 50 years of Montessori held at Chennai in 1989. She has been consulting with organisations like the Shreyas Foundation school at Ahmedabad and the Balasevika shibira of Vishva Hindu Parishad since 1990. She contributes articles to various Montessori publications in India.

==Montessori Associations linked to Training Institutions==
As training institutions grew and set roots in one place, they grew societies to support their students in their work in the field. They also helped in the work of propagation, and brought together all those interested in the method, be they Montessorians, parents, school management or public. We list here some of the prominent ones.

===Indian Montessori Center (IMC)===
Government regulations in India state that no education institution can be run by an individual. To solve that issue, IMC, a registered society was created in 1990 with S.R Swamy as the first chairman. Later, Meenakshi Sivaramakrishna continued as the Directess while B V A Rao took over as the chairman of IMC. Another center was also begun in South Bangalore. With all these new changes, AMI disaffiliated IMTC in 1999. IMTC came under the umbrella of IMC instead. Now, IMC has several chapters which operate in different states .Even in Kolkata there is IMC.

===Indian Montessori Association (IMA)===
Indian Montessori Association was created to support the students of IIMS, since they set up the first set of primary Montessori schools in India after Montessori’s time. Details of this association can be seen in the link provided.

=== Indian Montessori Foundation (IMF) ===
The Indian Montessori Foundation is a pan-Indian organisation established to promote Montessori education in India.

'''Their aim is to:'''
* Expand the awareness of Montessori philosophy in society
* Nurture Montessori principles in schools
* Promote research and development of all aspects of Montessori education
* Support AMI Montessori training
* Support and bring together the AMI Alumni
IMF is an affiliate of the '''Association Montessori Internationale (AMI)''' which has its headquarters in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

In 1929, Montessori established the Association Montessori International (AMI) to carry forward her humanistic social vision. AMI today, is a leading world body carrying forward Montessori's work in the spirit in which it was conceived. Headquartered in Amsterdam in Montessori's final home, AMI directs training programmes all over the world. AMI is affiliated to the United Nations through UNESCO and strives to further the rights of the child in society.

IMF carries out awareness programmes and arranges events to support the AMI Montessori training and local schools.

==Responses from other organisations, including the government==
Since the time of Montessori, many institutions have come to realise the value of her principles. Concepts like ‘child-centric’, ‘activity based’ and ‘discovery based’ methods have come into vogue with many educational institutions, both NGO run and Governmental. However, there has been a notable spurt of growth and development in the Montessori sphere in India.

'''Montessori sensorial materials''' are materials used in the [[Montessori]] classroom to help a child develop and refine his or her five senses. Use of these materials constitutes the next level of difficulty after those of practical life.

Like many other materials in the Montessori classroom, sensorial materials have what is called "control of error", meaning that the child not only works with the material, but has a way to check their work rather than seeking out the teacher if they have a question on whether or not they did it right. This is done to help promote independence and problem solving on the part of the child.

== Cylinder blocks ==
The cylinder blocks are ten wooden cylinders of various dimensions that can be removed from a fitted container block using a knobbed handle. To remove the cylinders, the child tends to naturally use the same three-finger grip used to hold pencils.

Several activities can be done with the cylinder blocks. The main activity involves removing the cylinders from the block and replacing them again in the spot that one got them from. The control of error is constituted in the child's inability to replace a cylinder in the wrong hole.

== Pink tower ==
The pink tower has ten pink [[cube]]s of different sizes, from 1&amp;nbsp;[[centimeter]] up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm in increments of 1&amp;nbsp;cm. The work is designed to provide the child with a concept of "big" and "small."  

The child starts with the largest cube and puts the second-largest cube on top of it. This continues until all ten cubes are stacked on top of each other.

The control of error is visual. The child sees the cubes are in the wrong order and knows that they should fix them. The successive dimensions of each cube are such that if the cubes are stacked flush with a corner, the smallest cube may be fit squarely on the ledge of each level

== Broad stair ==
The broad stair (also called Brown Stair) is designed to teach the concepts of "thick" and "thin". It comprises ten sets of wooden prisms with a natural or brown stain finish. Each stair is 20&amp;nbsp;cm in length and varies in thickness from 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;cm{{Dubious|date=January 2010}}.  When put together from thickest to thinnest, they make an even staircase.

As an extension, the broad stairs are often used with the pink tower to allow the child to make many designs.

&lt;gallery mode=packed heights=200&gt;
Image:PinkTowerandBroadStairs.jpg|The pink tower and the broad stair are shown here together in an extension activity.  
Image:BrownStairsAndPinkTower2.JPG|The child can make a variety of designs limited only by his or her imagination and the constraints of the material.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Red rods ==
The red rods are rods with a square cross section, varying only in length.  The smallest is 10&amp;nbsp;cm long and the largest is one meter long. Each rod is 2.5 cm/1inch square. By holding the ends of the rods with two hands, the material is designed to give the child a sense of long and short.

== Colored cylinders ==
Also called the ''knobless cylinders'', the colored cylinders are exactly the same dimensions as the cylinder blocks mentioned above.

There are 4 boxes of cylinders:
* Yellow cylinders that vary in height and width.  The shortest cylinder is the thinnest and the tallest cylinder is the thickest.
* Red cylinders that are the same height, but vary in width.
* Blue cylinders that have the same width, but vary in height.
* Green cylinders that vary in height and width.  The shortest cylinder is the thickest and the tallest cylinder is the thinnest.

The child can do a variety of exercises with these materials, including matching them with the cylinder blocks, stacking them on top of each other to form a tower, and arranging them in size or different patterns.  When the yellow, red, and green cylinders are placed on top of each other, they all are the same height.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/27682674@N02/2582293141/&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Binomial cube ==
The binomial cube is a cube that has the following pieces: one red cube, three black and red prisms, three black and blue prisms, and one blue cube.

A box with eight prisms represent the elements of &lt;math&gt;(a+b)^3&lt;/math&gt; or: &lt;math&gt;a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3&lt;/math&gt;

The pieces are stored in a box with two hinged opening sides. The color pattern of the cube is painted all around the outside of the box (except the bottom).

The material is not designed for math education until the elementary years of Montessori education. In the primary levels (ages 3-6), it is used as sensorial material.

&lt;gallery mode=packed heights=200&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Trinomial cube ==
The trinomial cube is similar to the binomial cube, but has the following pieces instead:
*1 red cube and 6 black and red prisms (varying in size)
*1 blue cube and 6 black and blue prisms (varying in size)
*1 yellow cube and 6 black and yellow prisms (varying in size)
*6 black prisms (same size)

This is similar to the binomial cube, but is a physical representation of this formula:

&lt;math&gt;(a+b+c)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3a^2c + b^3 + 3ab^2 + 3b^2c + c^3 + 3ac^2 + 3bc^2 + 6abc&lt;/math&gt;

== Other materials ==
There are many Montessori sensorial materials, and more are being investigated and developed by teachers around the world. Other popular Montessori sensorial materials include:
; Monomial cube :  A cube similar to the binomial and trinomial cube.  The child has a sensorial experience of the power of multiplying by two and developing that into a cube.
; Geometric cabinet :  Several different shapes are inset into wood and placed in drawers.  The child distinguishes the different shapes, learns their names, and learns how to discriminate from the shapes.
; The constructive triangles : Different triangles are put together to form various shapes.  Shapes made with the triangles include the parallelogram, hexagon, rhombus, and trapezoid.
; Color tablets : Boxes with tablets inside.  The sides are usually made of wood or plastic.  The middle is painted wood or plastic.  The only difference between them is the colors in the middle. There are three color boxes.  The first has the three primary colors (red, blue, and yellow).  The second has 12 different colors. The third box has nine colors, but in different grades from light to dark.
; Geometric solids : Ten Geometric three-dimensional shapes made from wood and usually painted blue.  The shapes are:
:* Sphere
:* Cone
:* Ovoid
:* Ellipsoid
:* Triangle-based pyramid
:* Square-based pyramid
:* Cube
:* Cylinder
:* Rectangular prism
:* Triangular prism
; The mystery bag : The mystery bag contains various object that the child feels and sorts without looking into the bag.  The object is removed after the child has decided how to sort it and a visual check is done.  (Though this may also be done blindfolded to add to the experience).
; Rough and smooth boards : Sandpaper is glued onto a smooth wood board. Various grading of sandpaper are used later as an extension of this activity to help the child discriminate between them.
; Fabric box : Different fabric materials are used that the child must feel and match. A blindfold is usually used so the child cannot see the materials.
; Thermic bottles: Water of different temperatures is added to metal bottles. The child lines them up from hottest to coldest.
; Baric tablets : Wooden tablets of various weight to help the child discriminate between weight.
; Sound cylinders : Two boxes, each containing six cylinders.  One set has a red top and the other a blue top.  When shaken, each cylinder of the same color gives off a different sound.  The sound from the red cylinder is matched with the same exact sound from the blue cylinder.
; Bells :  Twenty-six bells are used to help develop a sense of musical tones.

'''F. Moyra Allen''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}} (1921 &amp;ndash; May 2, 1996) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[nurse]] and professor. She helped develop the [[McGill Model of Nursing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The McGill Model of Nursing|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/nursing/about/model|website=Ingram School of Nursing|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She received her [[nursing]] education at the [[Montreal General Hospital School of Nursing]]. She also received a [[Bachelor of Nursing]] from [[McGill University]], a Master's degree from the [[University of Chicago]], and a [[Ph.D.]] in education from the [[Stanford Graduate School of Education]] in 1967. In 1954, she became an assistant professor at the [[McGill University School of Nursing]]. She became acting director of the School of Nursing in 1983, shortly before she retired in 1984.

In 1969, she founded the ''[[Nursing Papers]]'', now called the ''[[Canadian Journal of Nursing Research]]''.

In 1986, she was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]]. In 1979, she was awarded the [[Canadian Nurses Association]] [[Jeanne Mance]] [[Jeanne Mance Award|Award]], given to individuals who have made significant and innovative contributions to the health of Canadians.

'''MyDaughter''' is a British website set up by the [[Girls' Schools Association]] (GSA) offering advice to parents of daughters on all aspects of raising and educating girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article5158283.ece |title=Headmistresses offer key to teenage girls through MyDaughter website |publisher=Times Online |date=2008-11-15 |first=Alexandra |last=Frean |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advice is provided by head teachers from the member schools of the Girls' Schools Association and other specialists in fields such as nutrition, psychology, health education and business.

== History ==
MyDaughter.co.uk was launched in January 2009 following a survey of 1000 parents of daughters which asked 'How well do you know your daughter?' The survey found that sex and relationships were the most difficult subjects for parents to discuss with their daughters and that WAGs were the worst influence on girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1110045/High-heels-low-IQs-Dazzled-girls-want-WAGs-instead-having-careers-warn-headmistresses.html |title=High heels, low IQs |publisher=Daily Mail |date=2009-01-09 |first=Laura |last=Clark |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also highlighted a range of other topics that were a cause of anxiety to parents. The research revealed that parents wanted help and advice on how to deal with these issues.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, 9 January 2009, "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7819817.stm Girls 'under too much pressure'"]&lt;/ref&gt; This led the Girls' Schools Association to develop the MyDaughter brand as a source of online advice for parents. The Girls' Schools Association was approached by the Friday Project, an imprint of Harper Collins who will publish "Your Daughter", a book of the site in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;The Bookseller, "[http://www.thebookseller.com/news/111560-tfp-to-publish-girls-school-advice.html TFP to publish girls school advice"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205173151/http://www.thebookseller.com/news/111560-tfp-to-publish-girls-school-advice.html |date=2010-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NatlAssessmentOfEduProgress.jpg|thumb|NAEP Logo]]
[[File:TheNationsReportCard.png|thumb|The Nation's Report Card Logo]]

The '''National Assessment of Educational Progress''' ('''NAEP''') is the largest continuing and nationally representative assessment of what U.S. students know and can do in various subjects.  NAEP is a congressionally mandated project administered by the [[National Center for Education Statistics| National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)]], within the [[Institute of Education Sciences| Institute of Education Sciences (IES)]] of the [[U.S. Department of Education]]. The first national administration of NAEP occurred in 1969. The National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) is an independent, bipartisan board that sets policy for NAEP and is responsible for developing the framework and test specifications.The National Assessment Governing Board, whose members are appointed by the [[U.S. Secretary of Education]],  includes governors, state legislators, local and state school officials, educators, business representatives, and members of the general public. Congress created the 26-member Governing Board in 1988.

NAEP results are designed to provide group-level data on student achievement in various subjects, and are released as The Nation's Report Card. There are no results for individual students, classrooms, or schools. NAEP reports results for different demographic groups, including gender, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity. Assessments are given most frequently in [[mathematics]], [[reading (process)|reading]], [[science]] and [[writing]]. Other subjects such as [[arts|the arts]], [[civics]], [[economics]], [[geography]], technology and engineering literacy (TEL) and [[us history|U.S. history]] are assessed periodically.

In addition to assessing student achievement in various subjects, NAEP also surveys students, teachers, and school administrators to help provide contextual information. Questions asking about participants' race or ethnicity, school attendance, and academic expectations help policy makers, researchers, and the general public better understand the assessment results.

Teachers, principals, parents, policymakers, and researchers all use NAEP results to assess student progress across the country and develop ways to improve education in the United States. NAEP has been providing valid and reliable data on student performance since 1969.

NAEP uses a carefully designed [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] procedure that allows the assessment to be representative of the geographical, racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity of the schools and students in the United States. Data is also provided on students with disabilities and English language learners. Since NAEP assessments are administered uniformly to all participating students using the same test booklets and identical procedures across the nation, NAEP results serve as a common metric for states and select urban districts that participate in the assessment.

There are two NAEP websites: the [http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard NCES NAEP website] and [http://www.nationsreportcard.gov The Nation's Report Card website].  The first site details the NAEP program holistically, while the second focuses primarily on the individual releases of data.

== History ==
{{Education in the U.S.}}
NAEP began in 1964, with a grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Corporation]] to set up the Exploratory Committee for the Assessment of Progress in Education (ESCAPE). The first national assessments were held in 1969. Voluntary assessments for the states began in 1990 on a trial basis and in 1996 were made a permanent feature of NAEP to be administered every two years. In 2002, selected urban districts participated in the state-level assessments on a trial basis and continue as the Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA).

The development of a successful NAEP program has involved many, including researchers, state education officials, contractors, policymakers, students, and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/naephistory.asp |title=Measuring Student Progress Since 1964 |publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessments ==

There are two types of NAEP assessments, [http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/subjectareas.asp main NAEP] and [http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/ltt/ long-term trend NAEP]. This separation makes it possible to meet two objectives:

#As educational priorities change, develop new assessment instruments that reflect current educational content and assessment methodology. 
#Measure student progress over time.

=== Main ===

Main NAEP assessments are conducted in a range of subjects with fourth-, eighth- and twelfth-graders across the country.  Assessments are given most frequently in mathematics, reading, science, and writing. Other subjects such as the arts, civics, economics, geography, technology and engineering literacy (TEL), and U.S. history are assessed periodically.

These assessments follow subject-area frameworks that are developed by the NAGB and use the latest advances in assessment methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nagb.org/publications/frameworks.htm |title=Frameworks and Specifications |publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Under main NAEP, results are reported at the national level, and in some cases, the state and district levels.

==== National ====
National NAEP reports statistical information about student performance and factors related to educational performance for the nation and for specific demographic groups in the population (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender). It includes students from both public and nonpublic (private) schools and depending on the subject reports results for grades 4, 8, and 12.

==== State ====

State NAEP results are available in some subjects for grades 4 and 8. This allows participating states to monitor their own progress over time in mathematics, reading, science, and writing. They can then compare the knowledge and skills of their students with students in other states and with the nation.

The assessments given in the states are exactly the same as those given nationally. Traditionally, state NAEP was assessed only at grades 4 and 8. However, a 2009 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/pubs/main2009/2011455.asp#section3 |title=Results for public school students in 11 states available for the first time |publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  pilot program allowed 11 states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, South Dakota, and West Virginia) to receive scores at the twelfth-grade level.

Through 1988, NAEP reported only on the academic achievement of the nation as a whole and for demographic groups within the population. Congress passed legislation in 1988 authorizing a voluntary Trial State Assessment. Separate representative samples of students were selected from each state or jurisdiction that agreed to participate in state NAEP. Trial state assessments were conducted in 1990, 1992, and 1994. Beginning with the 1996 assessment, the authorizing statute no longer considered the state component a "trial.”

A significant change to state NAEP occurred in 2001 with the reauthorization of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]], also referred to as [[No Child Left Behind Act of 2001|"No Child Left Behind"]] legislation. This legislation requires that states which receive Title I funding must participate in state NAEP assessments in mathematics and reading at grades 4 and 8 every two years. State participation in other subjects assessed by state NAEP (science and writing) remains voluntary.

Like all NAEP assessments, state NAEP does not provide individual scores for the students or schools assessed.

==== Trial Urban District Assessment ====

The '''Trial Urban District Assessment''' ('''TUDA''') is a project developed to determine the feasibility of using NAEP to report on the performance of public school students at the district level. As authorized by congress, NAEP has administered the mathematics, reading, science, and writing assessments to samples of students in selected urban districts.

[http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/district.asp TUDA] began with six urban districts in 2002, and has since expanded to 27 districts for the 2017 assessment cycle.

=== Long-term trend ===

Long-term trend NAEP is administered to 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds periodically at the national level. Long-term trend assessments measure student performance in mathematics and reading and allow the performance of today's students to be compared with students since the early 1970s.

Although long-term trend and main NAEP both assess mathematics and reading, there are several differences between them. In particular, the assessments differ in the content assessed, how often the assessment is administered, and how the results are reported. These and other differences mean that results from long-term trend and main NAEP cannot be compared directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/ltt_main_diff.asp |title=What are the main differences between Long-Term Trend NAEP and Main NAEP? |publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assessment schedule ===

NAGB sets the calendar for NAEP assessments. Please refer to the entire [http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/assessmentsched.asp assessment schedule] for all NAEP assessments since 1968 and those planned through 2017.

Main NAEP assessments are typically administered over approximately six weeks between the end of January and the beginning of March of every year. Long-term trend assessments are typically administered every four years by age group between October and May.  All of the assessments are administered by NAEP-contracted field staff across the country.

=== NAEP State Coordinators (NSC) ===
NAEP is conducted in partnership with states. The NAEP program provides funding for a full-time NSC in each state. He or she serves as the liaison between NAEP, the state's education agency, and the schools selected to participate.

NSCs provide many important services for the NAEP program and are responsible for:
*coordinating the NAEP administration in the state,
*assisting with the analysis and reporting of NAEP data, and 
*promoting public understanding of NAEP and its resources

== New digitally-based assessments (DBA) ==

While most NAEP assessments are administered in a paper-and-pencil based format, NAEP is evolving to address the changing educational landscape through its transition to digitally-based assessments. NAEP is using the latest technology available to deliver assessments to students, and as technology evolves, so will the nature of delivery of the DBAs. The goal is for all NAEP assessments to be paperless by the end of the decade. The 2011 writing assessment was the first to be fully computer-based.

=== Interactive Computer Tasks (ICTs) ===
In 2009, ICTs were administered as part of the paper-and-pencil science assessment. The computer delivery affords measurement of science knowledge, processes, and skills not able to be assessed in other modes. Tasks included performance of investigations that include observations of phenomena that would otherwise take a long time, modeling of phenomena on a very large scale or invisible to the naked eye, and research of extensive resource documents.

=== Mathematics Computer-Based Study ===
This special study in multi-stage testing, implemented in 2011, investigated the use of adaptive testing principles in the NAEP context. A sample of students were given an online mathematics assessment which adapts to their ability level. All of the items in the study are existing NAEP items.

=== Technology and Engineering Literacy (TEL) Assessment  ===
The TEL assessment framework describes technology and engineering literacy as the capacity to use, understand, and evaluate technology as well as to understand technological principles and strategies needed to develop solutions and achieve goals. The three areas of the assessment are:

*'''Technology and society''' – deals with the effects that technology has on society and on the natural world and with the sorts of ethical questions that arise from those effects.
*'''Design and systems''' – covers the nature of technology; the engineering design process by which technologies are developed; and basic principles of dealing with everyday technologies, including maintenance and troubleshooting.
*'''Information and communication technology''' – includes computers and software learning tools; networking systems and protocols; hand-held digital devices; and other technologies for accessing, creating, and communicating information and for facilitating creative expression.

Eighth-grade students throughout the nation took the assessment in winter of 2014. Results from this assessment were released in May 2016.

=== Writing Computer-Based Assessment ===
In 2011, NAEP transitioned its writing assessment (at grades 8 and 12) from paper and pencil to a computer-based administration in order to measure students' ability to write using a computer.  The assessment takes advantage of many features of current digital technology and the tasks are delivered in multimedia formats, such as short videos and audio.  Additionally, in an effort to include as many students as possible, the writing computer-based assessment system has embedded within it several [[universal design]] features such as text-to-speech, adjustable font size, and electronic spell check.  In 2012, NAEP piloted the computer-based assessment for students at grade 4.

== Studies using NAEP data ==

In addition to the assessments, NAEP coordinates a number of related special studies that often involve special data collection processes, secondary analyses of NAEP results, and evaluations of technical procedures.

=== Achievement gaps ===

[[Achievement gap in the united states|Achievement gaps]] occur when one group of students outperforms another group and the difference in average scores for the two groups is statistically significant (that is, larger than the margin of error). In initial report releases NAEP highlights achievement gaps across student groups. However, NAEP has also releases a number of reports and data summaries that highlight achievement gap. – Some examples include the School Composition and the Black-White Achievement Gap and the Hispanic-White and the Black-White Achievement Gap Performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/studies/gaps/ Achievement Gaps] NAEP (homesite), retrieved 13 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; These publications use NAEP scores in mathematics and/or reading for these groups to either provide data summaries or illuminate patterns and changes in these gaps over time.  Research reports, like the School Composition and Black-White Achievement Gap, also include caveats and cautions to interpreting the data.

=== High School Transcript Study (HSTS) ===

The [http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/hsts/ HSTS] explores the relationship between grade 12 NAEP achievement and high school academic careers by surveying the curricula being followed in our nation's high schools and the course-taking patterns of high school students through a collection of transcripts. Recent studies have placed an emphasis on [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math|STEM]] education and how it correlates to student achievement on the NAEP mathematics and science assessments.

=== NAEP-TIMSS Linking Study ===

The [[TIMSS|Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS)]] is an international assessment by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) that measures student learning in mathematics and science. NCES initiated the NAEP-TIMSS linking study so that states and selected districts can compare their own students' performance against international benchmarks.  The linking study was conducted in 2011 at grade 8 in mathematics and science.  NCES will "project", state and district-level scores on TIMSS in both subjects using data from NAEP.

=== National Indian Education Study (NIES) ===

The [http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/nies/ NIES] is a two-part study designed to describe the condition of education for American Indian/Alaska Native students in the United States. The first part of the study consists of assessment results in mathematics and reading at grades 4 and 8. The second part presents the results of a survey given to American Indian/Alaska Native students, their teachers and their school administrators.  The surveys focus on the students' cultural experiences in and out of school.

=== Mapping State Proficiency Standards ===

Under the 2001 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965, states develop their own assessments and set their own proficiency standards to measure student achievement. Each state controls its own assessment programs, including developing its own standards, resulting in great variation among the states in statewide student assessment practices. This variation creates a challenge in understanding the achievement levels of students across the United States.
Since 2003, NCES has supported research that compares the proficiency standards of NAEP with those of individual states. State assessments are placed onto a common scale defined by NAEP scores, which allows states' proficiency standards to be compared not only to NAEP, but also to each other. 
NCES has released the Mapping State Proficiency Standards report using state data for mathematics and reading in 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, and most recently 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/studies/statemapping/ Mapping State Proficiency Standards] [[National Center for Education Statistics]], retrieved 13 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Past studies ===

Over the years, NCES has conducted a number of other studies related to different aspects of the NAEP program.  A few studies from the recent past are listed below:
*The [http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/studies/ors/ Oral Reading Study] was undertaken to discover how well the nation's fourth-graders can read aloud a typical grade 4 story. The assessment provided information about students' fluency in reading aloud and examined the relationship between oral reading, accuracy, rate, fluency, and reading comprehension.
*[http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/studies/charter/ America's Charter Schools] was a pilot study conducted as a part of the 2003 NAEP assessments in mathematics and reading at the fourth-grade level. While [[charter school]]s are similar to other public schools in many respects, they differ in several important ways, including the makeup of the student population and their location. 
*[http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/studies/privateschools/ Private Schools] educate about 10 percent of the nation's students.  In the first report, assessment results for all private schools and for the largest private school categories—Catholic, Lutheran, and Conservative Christian—were compared with those for public schools (when applicable).  The second report examined differences between public and private schools in 2003 NAEP mean mathematics and reading scores when selected characteristics of students and/or schools were taken into account.
*[http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/studies/tbaproject.asp Technology-Based Assessment project] was designed to explore the use of technology, especially the use of the computer as a tool to enhance the quality and efficiency of educational assessments.

== Criticism ==

NAEP's heavy use of [[statistical hypothesis testing]] has drawn some criticism related to interpretation of results. For example, the Nation's Report Card reported "Males Outperform Females at all Three Grades in 2005" as a result of science test scores of 100,000 students in each grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Male and Female Students Make Gains Since 2000 at Grade 4; Males Outperform Females at all Three Grades in 2005|url=http://nationsreportcard.gov/science_2005/s0110.asp|work=The Nation's Report Card|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde and Linn criticized this claim, because the mean difference was only 4 out of 300 points, implying a small [[effect size]] and heavily overlapped distributions. They argue that "small differences in performance in the NAEP and other studies receive extensive publicity, reinforcing subtle, persistent, biases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyde|first=Janet Shibley|author2=Marcia C. Linn|title=Gender similarities in mathematics and science|journal=Science|date=27 October 2006|volume=314|issue=5799|pages=599–600|doi=10.1126/science.1132154|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5799/599.summary|accessdate=16 September 2012|pmid=17068246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ogwen Cottage Outdoor Pursuits Centre''' is situated beside [[Llyn Ogwen]], in [[Gwynedd]], Wales. It is owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], who bought the property at auction in October 2014 for £450,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sapoe.org.uk/news/national-trust-purchase-ogwen-cottage-outdoor-centre SAPOE.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpbigwood.com/property/auction/204/results-350 CP Bigwood Auction Results]&lt;/ref&gt; It was formerly for many years part of [[Birmingham City Council]]'s Outdoor Learning Service, providing [[outdoor education]], and with links to the climbing community.

==Thomas Telford==
Located on the London to Holyhead [[A5 road (Great Britain)]], Ogwen developed as a stage coach inn and the present stores building was once stabling for horses. The nearby Tin Can Alley was a source of honing stones used to sharpen tools during the construction of the A5 by [[Thomas Telford]]. This mammoth project started in 1815 and it was 1836 by the time the first mail coach crossed the [[Menai Strait]]s via Telford's bridge.  Telford designed the milestones and the hexagonal toll houses every five miles. Toll houses survive in [[Capel Curig]] and [[Bethesda, Wales|Bethesda]], Wales whilst in the middle stands Ogwen.

==Climbers==
The centre is informally referred to as "The Cott" and has been used as a base for [[climbing|climbers]] since the nineteenth century. During the 1890s climbers stayed at Ogwen or the [[Pen-y-Gwryd]] and early accounts make mention of Mrs Jones of Ogwen Cottage; " Mrs Jones at Ogwen Cottage always most good naturedly received and fed us if we turned up, no matter at what hour.”

In 1895 Archer Thompson ascended Twll Du, climbing the ice with an unusual tool; "According to tradition Thor was armed with a hammer for his battle with the Frost Giants, and with such a weapon, we too, were luckily provided in the form of a hatchet, surreptitiously removed from Mrs Jones' coal cellar at Ogwen.”

The 1894 Climbers' Club Journal contained an advert for The Cott citing it as "the chief centre for climbers visiting Snowdonia….the cottage is on the high road and conveyances meet visitors at Bethesda Station if so desired.”

[[Geoffrey Winthrop Young]], a noted alpinist with many first ascents to his credit, stayed at Ogwen between visits to the Alps in the early 1900s.

==Mountaineering School==
1959 saw [[Ron James (mountaineer)|Ron James]], Trevor Jones and Tony Mason-Hornby purchasing The Cott from Mrs Williams and opening it as a mountaineering school. Ogwen became a climbing base and Mrs Williams gave the new owners advice on mounting rescues; "Fire a red flare in the car park – get the climbers together and put the one with the cleanest boots in charge.”

With increasing leisure time and improved transport links, Ogwen grew as a climbing mecca and The Cott's instructors regularly became involved in rescuing climbers in trouble and gradually a specialist mountain rescue team evolved into what is now the Ogwen Valley [[Mountain Rescue]] Organisation.

== Birmingham City Council ==
Ron James remained chief instructor for another five years after Birmingham City Council purchased The Cott in 1964.

Over the next 45 years thousands of Birmingham people attended courses at Ogwen. Until the 1980s courses were for a fortnight but economic considerations and the need to take more students meant a reduction to six days.

The Adventurous Activities Licensing Service (AALLS) pays regular visits and while the activities may not be as extreme as they once were, Ogwen is probably the only centre in the UK to programme multi-pitch climbing for secondary school students.

==Activities==
The traditional core of mountaineering activities remains with an emphasis on mountain walking and climbing but the programme has expanded to include kayaking, gorge walking, canoeing, ski trips, orienteering, expeditions. A student might ascend Hope on the Idwal Slabs as their first ever climb, before descending Suicide Wall by abseil.  An evening of orienteering and then the next day might see a kayak descent of the Afon Llugwy or a walk up Tryfan.

==Residential experience==
Ogwen now offers self-catering bunkhouse style accommodation and runs National Governing Body Awards and adventure courses for adults.

Students look after themselves, help serve meals, wash and tidy up. 

==Sale in 2014==
In October 2014 it was sold off by Birmingham City Council, which had to close its outdoor education service due to funding cuts and an increasing number of schools switching to different venues for educational trips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/campaign-save-ogwen-cottage-outdoor-7984962 Birmingham Mail]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] purchased it at auction for £450,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpbigwood.com/property/auction/204/results-350 CP Bigwood Auction results]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1647">'''Personal and Social Education (PSE)''' is a component of the [[state school]] [[curriculum]] in [[Wales]]. PSE became a statutory requirement in schools in September 2003, and is compulsory for all [[student]]s at [[Key Stage]]s 1, 2, 3 and 4 (5 to 16 years old), and shares some similar elements with [[Personal, Social and Health Education]] and [[Citizenship|citizenship education]] in [[England]]. These include:
* local and global [[community|communities]]
* [[sex education]]
* [[spirituality]]
* [[morals]]
* [[Environmentalism|environmental issues]]

==The PSE Framework==
For each Key Stage, learning outcomes for Knowledge &amp; Understanding are set in each of the Aspects (listed below); additionally, learning outcomes for the development of Attitudes &amp; Values and Skills are prescribed across all Aspects. [[ACCAC]], the curriculum authority for Wales (part of the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] from 1 April 2006), published these in the [[Personal and Social Education Framework|PSE Framework]] (2000). While it is not compulsory for schools to use the Framework, they are expected to use [[scheme of work|schemes of work]] in order to standardize practice across [[teacher]]s and [[Class (education)|class]]es.

Aspects:

* Community
* Emotional
* Environmental
* Learning
* Moral
* Physical
* Sexual
* Social
* Spiritual
* Vocational

A '''practicum''' (also called '''work placement''', especially in the [[UK]]) is a [[graduate school|graduate]] level course, often in a specialized field of study, that is designed to give students supervised practical application of a previously or concurrently studied theory. Practicums ([[student teaching]]) are common for [[education]] and [[social work]] majors.  In some cases, the practicum may be a part-time student teaching placement that occurs the semester before a student's full-time student teaching placement.

The process resembles an [[internship]]; however, the latter is often not part of the [[school]] program.

Practicum is widely practiced in Asia, especially in India. There, a B.Ed. student has to undergo rigorous training in Teaching and they have to face a lot of practicums to earn their degree. It generally makes one practically face a situation and describe their experience. It differs from Practical in terms of its handling mainly alive beings whereas Practical is confined within the inert materials.

'''Simulated Society''' (or '''SimSoc''', pronounced sim-sock) is a "[[Simulation game|game]]" used by [[university|universities]] and other groups to teach various aspects of [[sociology]], [[political science]], and [[communications]] skills.  Originally created by [[William A. Gamson]] in 1966, it is currently in its fifth edition.  It provides a way for participants to better understand the problems of [[governance|governing]] a 20th-century-style [[nation state]] society. The participants grapple with issues like [[economic inequality]], [[justice]], [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]], [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[Power (philosophy)|power dynamics]], and [[leadership]] as they negotiate their way through [[Labour economics|labor]]-[[management]] [[Labor relations|relations]], [[politics|political turmoil]], and [[natural disasters]]. To be successful, players must utilize basic [[Social control|social process]]es from [[cooperation]] and [[Reward (psychology)|reward]] to [[threat]] and [[punishment]]. The goal of SIMSOC is to bring a deeper understanding to everyday experiences as well as [[social theory|social]] and [[organizational theory]].

The '''[[State University of New York]] at Potsdam''', also known as '''SUNY Potsdam''', or, colloquially, Potsdam, is a public college in the village of [[Potsdam (village), New York|Potsdam]] in [[St. Lawrence County, New York|St. Lawrence County]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Founded in 1816, it is among the oldest colleges in the United States. It is composed of the College of Arts &amp; Sciences,the School of Business, the School of Education and Professional Studies, and the [[Crane School of Music]].

==History==
Potsdam was founded by Benjamin Raymond in 1816 as the '''St. Lawrence Academy'''. In 1834, the academy was chosen by the New York State Legislature to exclusively offer a [[teacher education]] program for its senatorial district. With funds from the state, and from support by preceptor Reverend Asa Brainerd, the first diploma in teaching was given in 1836, thus beginning the academy's and eventually the college's longstanding tradition of excellence in the field of teacher education.

In 1866, the State Legislature ended its funding of teacher education departments in private academies, and began establishing several [[normal school]]s throughout the state. The Village of Potsdam was thus named as one of four locations for new normal schools, and in 1867, the St. Lawrence Academy became the '''Potsdam Normal School'''.

By 1886, the Potsdam Normal School had become the first institution in the United States to offer a normal training course for public school music teachers in the United States. Founded by [[Julia E. Crane]], the '''Crane Normal Institute of Music''' continues today as the world-renowned [[Crane School of Music]] as a leader in the field of [[music education]].

The [[State University of New York]] was founded in 1948, and Potsdam became one of its founding members, and was thus renamed '''New York State Teachers College at Potsdam'''. In 1964, the college's mission changed to providing multiple programs, and the university adopted its current name.

During the 1980s, despite the college's traditional strengths in music and education, the college gained recognition for its quickly blossoming mathematics program under the guidance of Dr. [[Clarence F. Stephens]]. Known as the [[State University of New York at Potsdam#Potsdam Miracle|Potsdam Miracle]], Stephens transformed a practically non-existent department to having the third largest number of mathematics majors of any institution in the United States during his tenure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The college has a total enrollment of approximately 4,500 students and approximately 930 freshmen entered Potsdam in 2010. That is the biggest first-year class since 1982, and an 11.4 percent increase over last year's{{when|date=July 2017}} incoming freshman class, which had 835 students.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Campus==
The campus is in the small village of Potsdam, near the [[Canada–United States border]]. It is situated in the [[St. Lawrence Valley]], between the [[St. Lawrence River]] and the foothills of the [[Adirondack Mountains]]. It is about 10 miles northwest of the border of the [[Adirondack State Park]] in [[Parishville, New York|Parishville]].

The school sits on {{convert|240|acre|ha}} and consists of 44 buildings. Barrington Drive runs through the center of the campus, with all academic buildings on the northwest side of the street, and all campus life and residence buildings on the southeast side. The [[Crane School of Music]] campus is in the northern part of the campus, east of the academic quad.

The college has two libraries, the '''Frederick W. Crumb Memorial Library''' in the center of the academic quad, and the '''Crane Music Library''' in Schuette Hall at the Crane complex. The college also has six performance facilities: Hosmer Hall, Snell Theatre, and Wakefield Recital Hall (three venues in The Crane School of Music), the Proscenium Theater, the Black Box Theater, and the Dance Theater (three venues in the college's new Performing Arts Center).  The college also houses an art gallery and the '''Maxcy Hall Athletic Facility'''.

SUNY Potsdam is home to the '''[http://www.potsdam.edu/academics/AAS/weaver/index.cfm Charles T. Weaver Anthropology Museum]''', a teaching museum that allows students to curate exhibitions and have hands on experience with the museum's collection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.potsdam.edu/academics/AAS/weaver/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Also on campus is the '''[[Art Museum at SUNY Potsdam]]''', also known as the Gibson Gallery, which stresses its mission to connect students, faculty and all those on campus with visual art.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.potsdam.edu/museum/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

The affiliated non-profit organization that provides dining services and runs the union market and college bookstore on campus is known as PACES or Potsdam Auxiliary College Education Services. This organization is the largest financial supporter of the college, annually donating significant portions of their proceeds back to the college in support of scholarships and other initiatives on campus.

==Athletics==
In 1981 and 1986, under Hall of Fame Coach Jerry Welsh, the Potsdam Bears basketball team won the NCAA Division III National Championship.  In 1979, 1982, and 1985, the Potsdam Bears were national runners-up for this title. The SUNY-Potsdam men's ice hockey team has competed in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] for 27 years, from 1976 to the present. Most recently, they played in the [[State University of New York Athletic Conference]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hockeydb.com/stte/suny-potsdam-7799.html&lt;/ref&gt; which is a [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] [[athletics conference]]. The 1995-96 Men's Ice Hockey team won the hockey program's only SUNYAC title in school history, under Hall of Fame Coach Ed Seney.

SUNY Potsdam athletics were recently placed on NCAA probation due to an inadvertent error in the awarding of international student grants. The teams affected by the NCAA probation are men's and women's hockey, women's volleyball, men's and women's lacrosse, and women's soccer.

==ROTC==
Many SUNY Potsdam students participate in the [[Army ROTC]] and [[Air Force ROTC]] programs. Students can apply for ROTC scholarships to the university, and may commission as officers in the United States military upon graduation.

===Army ROTC===
SUNY Potsdam is a partner school of the Golden Knight Battalion, one of 272 Army ROTC Battalions in the United States. SUNY Potsdam students are the second largest group represented in the battalion, which is composed of approximately 100 ROTC Cadets. The headquarters for the Golden Knight Battalion is at 49 Elm St. in downtown Potsdam, where it has been for decades.

== A cappella ==
SUNY Potsdam has four a cappella groups on campus - The Potsdam Pointercounts (1993–Present), The A Sharp Arrangement (1994–Present), The Potsdam Pitches (2007–Present) and Stay Tuned (2012–Present). All four groups have competed in the ICCAs (International Championship of Collegiate A cappella) run by Varsity Vocals.

==Potsdam Miracle==
The '''Potsdam Miracle''' refers to the unusual success of the [[Mathematics]] Department at [[SUNY Potsdam]], USA, under the guidance of Dr. [[Clarence F. Stephens]], in attracting large numbers of students to become successful mathematics majors. For example, in one year, about 25% of the degrees conferred by Potsdam were in mathematics and over 40% of the institution’s [[Honors student|honor students]] were mathematics majors. The 184 majors that year was the third-largest number of colleges and universities in the [[United States]].

Seven of the eight [[valedictorian]]s for the period 1980–1987 were mathematics majors. No student who graduated from SUNY Potsdam between the time of its founding in 1816 and the arrival of Stephens in 1969 is known to have earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in mathematics. However, twelve students who graduated during Stephens's tenure are known to have done so, half of them women.

The Potsdam Miracle confirmed the effectiveness of the Potsdam Model of mathematics education. The model is based not on lowering student standard but in raising teaching standards.

In explaining the program in Dilip Datta's book ''Math Education at its Best: The Potsdam Model'', Stephens said his primary goal was to create the most favorable possible conditions for students to learn and for faculty to teach. He and a team of other student-oriented faculty members taught a course, "How to Read Mathematics Literature with Understanding and to Become Independent Learners", to students early in their study of mathematics. For undergraduates, that was typically in the freshman or sophomore year, while for graduate students it was during their first year.
 
The Potsdam Model is “based on the premise that the study of pure mathematics can be undertaken successfully by a large number of students if they are provided with a supportive environment including: careful and considerate teaching by a well-trained and dedicated faculty, continual encouragement, successful (student) role models, enough success to develop self-esteem, enough time to develop intellectually, recognition of their achievement, and the belief that the study is a worthwhile endeavor.”

Stephens had largely developed his ideas and earlier implemented them at Morgan State College (now [[Morgan State University]]). Although no graduates of Morgan are known to have received a Ph.D. in mathematics, nine did so during his tenure there. Hence, the Potsdam Model is sometimes called the Morgan-Potsdam Model.

'''''Walden, a game''''' is a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] open world [[video game]] developed by [[Tracy Fullerton]] and the [http://www.gameinnovationlab/ USC Game Innovation Lab] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[PlayStation 4]]. Released on [[itch.io]] on July 4, 2017 for PC/Mac and [[PlayStation 4]] on May 15, 2018, the game translates the experience of naturalist and author [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s stay at Walden Pond in 1845-47 to a video game. &lt;ref&gt;Andy Chalk, [http://www.pcgamer.com/walden-the-henry-david-thoreau-survival-game-comes-out-on-july-4/ "Walden, the Henry David Thoreau survival game, comes out on July 4"], ''PC Gamer''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/300719/USC_GAME_INNOVATION_LABS_WALDEN_A_GAME_ARRIVES_JULY_4_ONWINDOWS_PC_AND_MAC.php "USC Game Innovation Lab’s Walden, A Game Arrives July 4 on Windows PC and Mac"], ''Gamasutra''&lt;/ref&gt; The game was announced for [[PlayStation 4]] at the 2017 PlayStation Experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinema.usc.edu/news/article.cfm?id=19388 "USC Games Projects to be Showcased at Playstation Experience"], ''School of Cinematic Arts News''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay and plot==
The gameplay in ''Walden, a game'' is balanced between several goals: surviving in the woods through self reliant living; seeking inspiration in the woods through attention to animals, sounds, solitude and books; and exploration and discovery of the social and personal context leading to Thoreau's experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Rose, [http://www.byuradio.org/episode/fd3a7e35-ab0a-4994-aeb3-bf02980fca43?playhead=3682&amp;autoplay=true "Walden -- The Digital Version"], ''Top of Mind, BYU Radio''&lt;/ref&gt;

The survival simulation focuses on the four "necessaries of life" as described by Thoreau in the book [[Walden]] -- food, fuel, shelter and clothing. Players must care-take these aspects of their life in the woods in order to maintain their energy. If they fail to do so, they will faint from exhaustion. &lt;ref&gt;Greg Toppo, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/07/11/henry-david-thoreau-walden-pond-game-dives-into-deliberate-living/468756001/ "Learn to ‘live deliberately’ with ‘Walden’ game on Thoreau’s birthday"], ''USA Today''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The inspiration aspects of the game focus on several of the themes discussed in the later chapters of the book [[Walden]] -- visitors, sound, solitude and reading. Players can find inspiration by exploring the woods and interacting with animals (visitors), finding places of solitude, which are marked by cairns, listening to the sounds of civilization (wagons, a train whistle, church bells, etc) that can be heard from the edges of the woods, and reading the books found throughout the woods. When the player is inspired, the colors and sounds of the game are richer, however if they let their inspiration fall, these colors and sounds will become dull.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Stern, [https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2017/summer/feature/in-walden-the-video-game-you-the-player-are-henry-david-thoreau "In Walden the Video Game, You the Player Are Henry David Thoreau"], ''Humanities Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to care-taking survival and inspiration, the player may also explore Thoreau's world to discover a series of intertwined stories about his life and the tensions in the world around him that sent him to the woods for his experiment in self-reliant living. Letters and visits from his mentor [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] explore his ambitions as a writer. A series of poetic clues from his sister Sophia lead the player to secret areas of the woods and to an understanding of a mutual tragedy. Other storylines follow Thoreau's involvement in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist movement]] of the times, his work as a surveyor, and his connections to prominent scientist [[Louis Agassiz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://playdategameshow.com/past-playdates/podcast/is01/  "Playdate Podcast Interview Series"&lt;/ref&gt;

The game takes place over the course of the first year of Thoreau's stay in the woods, as does the book of Walden. At the end of the year, as Spring comes, Thoreau experiences a re-birth and re-connection to life, and the player can choose to leave the woods, or to stay and continue their own experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Cambell, [https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/5/5/15510180/walden-thoreau-preview-video "Life, and how to live it, explored in a new game"], ''Polygon''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The game was developed over the course of ten years as a research project at the [http://www.gameinnovationlab/ USC Game Innovation Lab] lead by [[Tracy Fullerton]]. The game began production in 2007 without funding, but in 2012 was awarded a media arts grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts|NEA]] to support production of the game.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arts.gov/art-works/2013/nea-arts-level "NEA Arts: Level Up!],''National Endowment for the Arts''&lt;/ref&gt; This support was followed by admission into the Sundance New Frontier Story Lab in 2014, and grants from the [[NEH]] Digital Projects for the Public.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sundance.org/blogs/news/creative-teams-and-projects-selected-for-new-frontier-story-lab-oct-2014 "Sundance Institute Selects Six Creative Teams and Projects for New Frontier Story Lab"], ''Sundance site''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Boehm, [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-online-gaming-world-warcraft-neh-federal-grants-20141208-story.html "Move over ‘Warcraft,’ NEH is funding new online games"], ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Vu, [https://news.usc.edu/81012/game-innovation-lab-receives-two-grants-to-advance-creativity/ "Game Innovation Lab receives two grants to fuel creativity"], ''USC News''&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew for the production was made up of a small core team of faculty and staff from the Game Innovation Lab as well as students who participated over the years. The audio design and music composition for the game was done by Michael Sweet of Berklee College of Music and the score for the game was recorded live at Berklee College.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Reese, [https://lwer.podbean.com/e/level-75-michael-sweet-walden-a-game-berklee-college-of-music/ "Level 75: Michael Sweet (Walden, a Game, Berklee College of Music)"], ''Level Podcast''&lt;/ref&gt;

The voice of Henry David Thoreau is performed by actor [[Emile Hirsch]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6649036/fullcredits/ "Walden, a game full cast and crew"], ''IMDb''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Walden, a game'' was selected for several festivals prior to its launch, including [[Indiecade]] 2014 (Digital Select), Indiecade 2015 (Finalist), Tokyo Game Show Sense of Wonder Night 2015, International Documentary Film Festival 2015, Sheffield Doc Fest 2015 (Special Mention Interactive Award), Meaningful Play 2016 (Most Meaningful Game Award) and Davos BetaZone 2017 at the World Economic Forum.

'''Wesley College of Education''' is a teacher education college in [[Kumasi]], [[Ashanti Region]] in [[Ghana]].  It was initially established for the training of teachers, catechists and ministers. It was founded by the Methodist Church, located between New Tafo and Old Tafo towns. The beginning of Wesley College of Education goes back to 1918. Following the signing of the lease, the college was named, and  the foundation stone of the present site was laid in 1922.


The courses offered in the College have gone through upgrading from 2-year Cert ‘B’; 4-year Cert ‘A’; 2-year Post-Secondary Cert ‘A; 3-year Post-Secondary Cert ‘A’; and now Diploma in Basic Education (DBE) by the passage of a Parliamentary Bill, Education Act 778 on 6 January 2008. Currently, Wesley College of Education offers special programmes at the Diploma in Basic Education level. These are Science, Mathematics and French.

The college participated in the [[Department for International Development|DFID]]-funded [[Transforming Teacher Education and Learning programme, Ghana|T-TEL]] programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.t-tel.org/about/coes-network.html |title=Our network |website=Transforming Teacher Education and Learning, Ghana |access-date=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
