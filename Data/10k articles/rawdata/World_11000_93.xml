==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Austria}}

[[File:Ostarrichi.jpg|thumb|left|The first appearance of the word "Ostarrîchi", circled in red. Modern Austria honours this document, dated 996, as the founding of the nation.]]

The German name for Austria, {{lang|de|Österreich}}, derives from the [[Old High German]] ''Ostarrîchi'', which meant "eastern realm" and which first appeared in the "Ostarrîchi document" of 996.&lt;ref name="University of Klagenfurt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwg.uni-klu.ac.at/spw/oenf/name2.htm|title=University of Klagenfurt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor1-last = Bischof| editor1-first=Günter| editor-link=Günter Bischof |editor2-last=Pelinka| editor2-first=Anton| editor2-link=Anton Pelinka| title=Austrian Historical Memory and National Identity| publisher=Transaction Publishers| place=New Brunswick| date=1997| isbn=978-1-56000-902-3 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=tfhADwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT34&amp;lpg=PA92#v=onepage|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word is probably a translation of [[Medieval Latin]] {{lang|la|[[Marchia orientalis]]}} into a local (Bavarian) dialect. Another theory says that this name comes from the local name of the mountain whose original Slovenian name is "Ostravica" (sharp mountain) - because it is very steep on both sides.
Austria was a prefecture of Bavaria created in 976. The word "Austria" is a Latinisation of the German name and was first recorded in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| ref=harv |author-last1 = Brauneder| author-first1 = Wilhelm| title = Österreichische Verfassungsgeschichte| edition = 11th| publisher = Manzsche Verlags- und Universitätsbuchhandlung| place = Vienna| date = 2009| isbn = 978-3-214-14876-8| page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the time, the Danube basin of Austria ([[Upper Austria|Upper]] and [[Lower Austria]]) was the easternmost extent of Bavaria.

[[File:2011-07-09 gasometer 28.JPG|thumb|[[Venus of Willendorf]], 28,000 to 25,000 BC. [[Naturhistorisches Museum|Museum of Natural History Vienna]]]]

The Central European land that is now Austria was settled in pre-Roman times by various [[Celt]]ic tribes. The Celtic kingdom of [[Noricum]] was later claimed by the [[Roman Empire]] and made a province. Present-day Petronell-[[Carnuntum]] in eastern Austria was an important army camp turned capital city in what became known as the Upper Pannonia province. Carnuntum was home for 50,000 people for nearly 400 years.&lt;ref name="Carnuntum Tourism"&gt;{{cite web|last =|first =|authorlink =|title =Rome's metropolis on the Danube awakens to new life|website =Archäologischer Park Carnuntum|publisher =Archäologische Kulturpark Niederösterreich Betriebsgesellschaft m.b.H.|date =|url =http://www.carnuntum.co.at/content-en/tales-from-carnuntum|doi =|accessdate =20 February 2010|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100116125751/http://www.carnuntum.co.at/content-en/tales-from-carnuntum|archivedate =16 January 2010|deadurl =yes|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Roman Empire, the area was invaded by [[Bavarians]], [[Slavs]], and [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]].&lt;ref name="johnson 19" /&gt; [[Charlemagne]], King of the Franks, conquered the area in AD 788, encouraged colonization, and introduced Christianity.&lt;ref name="johnson 19"&gt;Johnson 19&lt;/ref&gt; As part of [[Eastern Francia]], the core areas that now encompass Austria were bequeathed to the house of [[Babenberg]]. The area was known as the ''[[March of Austria|marchia Orientalis]]'' and was given to [[Leopold I of Austria (Babenberg)|Leopold of Babenberg]] in 976.&lt;ref name="johnson 20"&gt;Johnson 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

The first record showing the name Austria is from 996, where it is written as ''[[Ostarrîchi]]'', referring to the territory of the Babenberg March.&lt;ref name="johnson 20" /&gt; In 1156, the [[Privilegium Minus]] elevated Austria to the status of a duchy. In 1192, the Babenbergs also acquired the Duchy of [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]]. With the death of [[Frederick II of Austria|Frederick II]] in 1246, the line of the Babenbergs was extinguished.&lt;ref name="johnson 21"&gt;Johnson 21&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] effectively assumed control of the duchies of Austria, Styria, and [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]].&lt;ref name="johnson 21" /&gt; His reign came to an end with his defeat at [[Dürnkrut]] at the hands of [[Rudolph I of Germany]] in 1278.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 23&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, until World War I, Austria's history was largely that of its ruling dynasty, the [[Habsburgs]].

=== Middle Ages ===
In the 14th and 15th centuries, the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs]] began to accumulate other provinces in the vicinity of the Duchy of Austria. In 1438, Duke [[Albert V of Austria]] was chosen as the successor to his father-in-law, [[Emperor Sigismund]]. Although Albert himself only reigned for a year, henceforth every emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was a Habsburg, with only one exception.

[[File:Vienna Battle 1683.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Vienna]] in 1683 broke the advance of the [[Ottoman Empire]] into Europe.]]

The Habsburgs began also to accumulate territory far from the hereditary lands. In 1477, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Maximilian]], only son of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]], married the heiress Maria of [[County of Burgundy|Burgundy]], thus acquiring most of the [[Netherlands]] for the family.&lt;ref name="johnson 25"&gt;Lonnie Johnson 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brook 11"&gt;Brook-Shepherd 11&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Fair]] married [[Joanna the Mad]], the heiress of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], thus acquired Spain and its Italian, African, and [[New World]] appendages for the Habsburgs.&lt;ref name="johnson 25" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brook 11" /&gt;

In 1526, following the [[Battle of Mohács]], [[Bohemia]] and the part of [[Hungary]] not occupied by the Ottomans came under Austrian rule.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 26&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ottoman–Hungarian Wars|Ottoman expansion]] into Hungary led to [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|frequent conflicts]] between the two empires, particularly evident in the [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] of 1593 to 1606. The Turks made incursions into [[Styria]] nearly 20 times,&lt;ref&gt;"'' The Catholic encyclopedia''". Charles George Herbermann (1913). Robert Appleton company.&lt;/ref&gt; of which some are cited as "burning, pillaging, and taking thousands of slaves".&lt;ref&gt;"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8-ARAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA560#v=onepage Bentley's miscellany]''". Charles Dickens, William Harrison Ainsworth, Albert Smith (1853).&lt;/ref&gt; In late September 1529 Suleiman the Magnificent launched the first [[Siege of Vienna]], which unsuccessfully ended, according to Ottoman historians, with the snowfalls of an early beginning winter.

=== 17th and 18th centuries ===
[[File:CongressVienna.jpg|thumb|[[The Congress of Vienna]] met in 1814–15. The objective of the Congress was to settle the many issues arising from the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].]]

During the long reign of [[Emperor Leopold I|Leopold I]] (1657–1705) and following the successful [[Battle of Vienna|defence of Vienna]] against the Turks in 1683 (under the command of the King of Poland, [[John III Sobieski]]),&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 26–28&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Great Turkish War|series of campaigns]] resulted in bringing most of Hungary to Austrian control by the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699.

[[Emperor Charles VI]] relinquished many of the gains the empire made in the previous years, largely due to his apprehensions at the imminent extinction of the House of Habsburg. Charles was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for recognition of the [[Pragmatic Sanction]] that made his daughter [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] his heir. With the rise of [[Prussia]], the [[German dualism|Austrian–Prussian dualism]] began in Germany. Austria participated, together with Prussia and Russia, in the first and the third of the three [[Partitions of Poland]] (in 1772 and 1795).

===19th century===
[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|A map showing the [[German Confederation]] (1815-1836) with its 39 member states.]]

Austria later became engaged in a war with [[Revolutionary France]], at the beginning highly unsuccessfully, with successive defeats at the hands of Napoleon, meaning the end of the old Holy Roman Empire in 1806. Two years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 34&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]] was founded. From 1792 to 1801, the Austrians had suffered 754,700 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Clodfelter&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814, Austria was part of the Allied forces that invaded France and brought to an end the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

It emerged from the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 as one of the continent's four dominant powers and a recognised [[great power]]. The same year, the [[German Confederation]] ({{lang|de|Deutscher Bund}}) was founded under the presidency of Austria. Because of unsolved social, political, and national conflicts, the German lands were shaken by the [[1848 revolution]] aiming to create a unified Germany.&lt;ref name="johnson 36"&gt;Johnson 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The various different possibilities for a united Germany were: a [[Kleindeutschland and Großdeutschland|Greater Germany]], or a [[United States of Greater Austria|Greater Austria]] or just the German Confederation without Austria at all. As Austria was not willing to relinquish its German-speaking territories to what would become the [[Unification of Germany|German Empire of 1848]], the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the Prussian King [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]]. In 1864, Austria and Prussia fought together against [[Denmark]] and secured the independence from Denmark of the duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. As they could not agree on how the two duchies should be administered, though, they fought the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866. Defeated by Prussia in the [[Battle of Königgrätz]],&lt;ref name="johnson 36" /&gt; Austria had to leave the German Confederation and subsequently no longer took part in German politics.&lt;ref name="johnson 55"&gt;Lonnie Johnson 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schulze 233&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the ''Ausgleich'', provided for a dual sovereignty, the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], under [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]].&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 59&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian-Hungarian rule of this diverse empire included various [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] groups, including Croats, Czechs, Poles, [[Rusyns]], Serbs, Slovaks, Slovenes, and Ukrainians, as well as large Italian and Romanian communities.

[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|An ethno-linguistic map of Austria–Hungary, 1910]]

As a result, ruling Austria–Hungary became increasingly difficult in an age of emerging nationalist movements, requiring considerable reliance on an expanded secret police. Yet, the government of Austria tried its best to be accommodating in some respects: The ''Reichsgesetzblatt'', publishing the laws and ordinances of [[Cisleithania]], was issued in eight languages; all national groups were entitled to schools in their own language and to the use of their mother tongue at state offices, for example.
[[File:Deutscher Schulverein.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A stamp which was used predominantly by the pan-German movements in the Austro-Hungarian Empire which reads: "''And the German spirit will once heal the world''."]]
Many Austrians of all different social circles such as [[Georg Ritter von Schönerer]]  promoted strong [[German nationalism in Austria|pan-Germanism]] in hope of reinforcing an ethnic German identity and the annexation of Austria to Germany.&lt;ref name="DPSO"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | title=Das politische System in Österreich (The Political System in Austria) | publisher=Austrian Federal Press Service | date=2000 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | page=24 | language=German | location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Austrians such as [[Karl Lueger]] also used pan-Germanism as a form of populism to further their own political goals. Although Bismarck's policies excluded Austria and the German Austrians from Germany, many Austrian pan-Germans idolized him and wore blue cornflowers, known to be the favourite flower of German Emperor [[William I, German Emperor|William I]], in their buttonholes, along with cockades in the German national colours (black, red, and yellow), although they were both temporarily banned in Austrian schools, as a way to show discontent towards the multi-ethnic empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Daniel L. |last=Unowsky |title=The Pomp and Politics of Patriotism: Imperial Celebrations in Habsburg Austria, 1848–1916 |publisher=Purdue University Press |year=2005 |page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austria's exclusion from Germany caused many Austrians a problem with their national identity and prompted the Social Democratic Leader [[Otto Bauer]] to state that it was "the conflict between our Austrian and German character."&lt;ref&gt;Evan Burr Bukey, Hitler's Austria: Popular Sentiment in the Nazi Era, 1938-1945, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The Austro-Hungarian Empire caused ethnic tension between the German Austrians and the other ethnic groups. Many Austrians, especially those involved with the pan-German movements, desired for the reinforcement of an ethnic German identity and hoped that the empire would collapse which would subsequently allow an [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria with Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte Hamann, Hitler's Vienna: A Portrait of the Tyrant as a Young Man, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;

A lot of Austrian pan-German nationalists protested passionately against minister-president [[Count Kasimir Felix Badeni|Kasimir Count Badeni]]'s language decree of 1897, which made German and Czech co-official languages in Bohemia and required new government officials to be fluent in both languages. This meant in practice that the civil service would almost exclusively hire Czechs, because most middle-class Czechs spoke the German language, but not the other way around. The support of [[ultramontanism|ultramontane]] Catholic politicians and clergy for this reform triggered the launch of the "[[Away from Rome]]" ({{lang-de|Los-von-Rom}}) movement, which was initiated by supporters of Schönerer and called on "German" Christians to leave the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Suppan |title='Germans' in the Habsburg Empire | work=The Germans and the East | year=2008 | pages=164, 172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Second Constitutional Era]] began in the [[Ottoman Empire]], Austria-Hungary took the opportunity to annex [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria-Hungary|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/boshtml/bos127.htm |title=The Annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 1908 |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |date= |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The
[[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]] in 1914 by Bosnian Serb [[Gavrilo Princip]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 52–54&lt;/ref&gt; was used by leading Austrian politicians and generals to persuade the emperor to declare war on Serbia, thereby risking and prompting the outbreak of World War I, but it was not the only cause of the war. which eventually led to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Over one million Austro-Hungarian soldiers died in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Grebler, Leo and Winkler, Wilhelm ''The Cost of the World War to Germany and Austria-Hungary'', Yale University Press, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October 1918, the elected German members of the ''Reichsrat'' (parliament of Imperial Austria) met in Vienna as the Provisional National Assembly for German Austria (''Provisorische Nationalversammlung für Deutschösterreich''). On 30 October the assembly founded the [[Republic of German Austria]] by appointing a government, called ''Staatsrat''. This new government was invited by the Emperor to take part in the decision on the planned armistice with Italy, but refrained from this business.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

This left the responsibility for the end of the war, on 3 November 1918, solely to the emperor and his government. On 11 November, the emperor, advised by ministers of the old and the new governments, declared he would not take part in state business any more; on 12 November, German Austria, by law, declared itself to be a democratic republic and part of the new German republic. The constitution, renaming the ''Staatsrat'' as ''Bundesregierung'' (federal government) and ''Nationalversammlung'' as ''Nationalrat'' (national council) was passed on 10 November 1920.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] of 1919 (for Hungary the [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920) confirmed and consolidated the new order of Central Europe which to a great extent had been established in November 1918, creating new states and altering others. The German-speaking parts of Austria which had been part of Austria-Hungary were reduced to a rump state named The [[Republic of German-Austria]] (German: ''Republik Deutschösterreich'').&lt;ref&gt;In Habsburg Austria-Hungary, "German-Austria" was an unofficial term for the areas of the empire inhabited by Austrian Germans.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred D.

The status of German Bohemia (Sudetenland) later played a role in sparking the Second World War.&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;Brook-Shepherd 245&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of South Tyrol was a lingering problem between Austria and Italy until it was officially settled by the 1980s with a great degree of autonomy being granted to it by the Italian national government. Between 1918 and 1919, Austria was known as the State of [[German Austria]] ({{lang|de|Staat Deutschösterreich}}). Not only did the [[Allies of World War I|Entente powers]] forbid German Austria to unite with Germany, but they also rejected the name German Austria in the peace treaty to be signed; it was, therefore, changed to Republic of Austria in late 1919.&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;

The border between Austria and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia) was settled with the [[Carinthian Plebiscite]] in October 1920 and allocated the major part of the territory of the former Austro-Hungarian Crownland of Carinthia to Austria. This set the border on the [[Karavanke|Karawanken]] mountain range, with many Slovenes remaining in Austria.

After the war, inflation began to devalue the Krone, which was still Austria's currency. In autumn 1922, Austria was granted an international loan supervised by the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 257–8&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy, stabilise the currency, and improve Austria's general economic condition. The loan meant that Austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the League of Nations. In 1925, the ''[[Austrian schilling|Schilling]]''  was introduced, replacing the Krone at a rate of 10,000:1. Later, it was nicknamed the "Alpine dollar" due to its stability. From 1925 to 1929, the economy enjoyed a short high before nearly crashing{{clarify|date=December 2016}} after [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Black Tuesday]].

The [[First Austrian Republic]] lasted until 1933, when Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], using what he called [[Selbstausschaltung des Parlaments|"self-switch-off of Parliament"]], established an autocratic regime tending towards [[Italian fascism]].&lt;ref name="johnson 104"&gt;Lonnie Johnson 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brook 269"&gt;Brook-Shepherd 269–70&lt;/ref&gt; The two big parties at this time, the Social Democrats and the Conservatives, had paramilitary armies;&lt;ref name="Brook-Shepherd 261"&gt;Brook-Shepherd 261&lt;/ref&gt; the Social Democrats' ''[[Republikanischer Schutzbund|Schutzbund]]'' was now declared illegal, but was still operative&lt;ref name="Brook-Shepherd 261" /&gt; as [[Austrian Civil War|civil war]] broke out.&lt;ref name="johnson 104" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brook 269" /&gt;&lt;ref name="johnson 107"&gt;Johnson 107&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1934, several members of the ''Schutzbund'' were executed,&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 283&lt;/ref&gt; the Social Democratic party was outlawed, and many of its members were imprisoned or emigrated.&lt;ref name="johnson 107" /&gt; On 1 May 1934, the [[Austrofascism|Austrofascists]] imposed a new constitution ("Maiverfassung") which cemented Dollfuss's power, but on 25 July he was assassinated in a [[Nazi]] coup attempt.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 292&lt;/ref&gt;

His successor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] acknowledged Austria as a "German state" and that Austrians were "better Germans" but wished for Austria to remain independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vsl6mwMXl4YC&amp;pg=PA37|title=Constructing and Deconstructing National Identity: Dramatic Discourse in Tom Murphy's The Patriot Game and Felix Mitterer's In Der Löwengrube|first=Birgit|last=Ryschka|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Peter Lang|via=Google Books|isbn=9783631581117}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced a referendum on 9 March 1938, to be held on 13 March, concerning Austria's independence from Germany. On 12 March 1938, Austrian Nazis took over government, while German troops occupied the country, which prevented Schuschnigg's referendum from taking place.&lt;ref name="johnson 112"&gt;Lonnie Johnson 112–3&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 March 1938, the ''[[Anschluss]]'' of Austria was officially declared. Two days later, Austrian-born [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] announced what he called the "reunification" of his home country with the "rest of the [[Nazi Germany|German Reich]]" on Vienna's [[Heldenplatz]]. He established a plebiscite confirming the union with Germany in April 1938.

Parliamentary elections were held in Germany (including recently annexed Austria) on 10 April 1938. They were the final elections to the Reichstag during Nazi rule, and took the form of a single-question referendum asking whether voters approved of a single Nazi-party list for the 813-member Reichstag, as well as the recent annexation of Austria (the Anschluss). Jews and Gypsies were not allowed to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gellately, Social Outsiders in Nazi Germany, (2001), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Turnout in the election was officially 99.5%, with 98.9% voting "yes". In the case of Austria, Adolf Hitler's native soil, 99.71% of an electorate of 4,484,475 officially went to the ballots, with a positive tally of 99.73%.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[[German election and referendum, 1938]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although most Austrians favoured the ''Anschluss'', in certain parts of Austria the German soldiers were not always welcomed with flowers and joy, especially in Vienna which had Austria's largest Jewish population.&lt;ref&gt;Evan Burr Bukey, Hitler's Austria: Popular Sentiment in the Nazi Era, 1938–1945, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, despite the propaganda and the manipulation and rigging which surrounded the ballot box result, there was massive genuine support for Hitler for fulfilling the ''Anschluss'',&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw, 2001, Hitler 1936–1945: Nemesis, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; since many Germans from both Austria and Germany saw it as completing the long overdue German unification of all Germans united into one-state.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Stackelberg, Hitler's Germany: Origins, Interpretations, Legacies, p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March 1938, Austria was annexed to the [[Third Reich]] and ceased to exist as an independent country. The [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanisation]] of the wealth of Jewish Austrians started immediately in mid-March, with a so-called "wild" (i.e. extra-legal) phase, but was soon structured legally and bureaucratically to strip Jewish citizens of any assets they possessed. The Nazis renamed Austria in 1938 as "[[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]]"&lt;ref name="johnson 112" /&gt; until 1942, when it was again renamed and called "Alpine and Danubian Gaue" (Alpen-und Donau-Reichsgaue).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jelavich|first=Barbara|title=Modern Austria: Empire and Republic, 1815-1986|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521316255|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitz-Berning|first=Cornelia|title=Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus|year=2007|publisher=de Gruyter|language=German|isbn=978-3110195491|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Austrians made up only 8% of the population of the Third Reich,&lt;ref name=dav_art_nazi_past /&gt; some of the most prominent Nazis were native Austrians, including [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]], [[Franz Stangl]], and [[Odilo Globocnik]],&lt;ref&gt;Ian Wallace (1999).

Cambridge University Press. p.43. {{ISBN|0-521-85683-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vienna fell on 13 April 1945, during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Vienna Offensive]], just before the total collapse of the Third Reich. The invading Allied powers, in particular the Americans, planned for the supposed "Alpine Fortress Operation" of a national redoubt, that was largely to have taken place on Austrian soil in the mountains of the eastern Alps. However, it never materialised because of the rapid collapse of the Reich.

[[Karl Renner]] and [[Adolf Schärf]] (Socialist Party of Austria [Social Democrats and Revolutionary Socialists]), Leopold Kunschak (Austria's People's Party [former Christian Social People's Party]), and Johann Koplenig (Communist Party of Austria) declared Austria's secession from the Third Reich by the Declaration of Independence on 27 April 1945 and set up a [[provisional government]] in Vienna under state Chancellor Renner the same day, with the approval of the victorious [[Red Army]] and backed by [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref name="johnson 135"&gt;Lonnie Johnson 135–6&lt;/ref&gt; (The date is officially named the birthday of the second republic.) At the end of April, most of western and southern Austria were still under Nazi rule. On 1 May 1945, the federal constitution of 1929, which had been terminated by dictator Dollfuss on 1 May 1934, was declared valid again.

Total [[World War II casualties#endnote Austria|military deaths]] from 1939 to 1945 are estimated at 260,000.&lt;ref&gt;Rüdiger Overmans. ''Deutsche militärische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg.'' Oldenbourg 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish Holocaust victims totalled 65,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/44183/Austria/33382/Anschluss-and-World-War-II Anschluss and World War II]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; About 140,000 Jewish Austrians had fled the country in 1938–39. Thousands of Austrians had taken part in serious Nazi crimes (hundreds of thousands died in [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] alone), a fact officially recognised by Chancellor [[Franz Vranitzky]] in 1992.

=== Contemporary era ===
[[File:Uno City Kaiserwasser.jpg|thumb|The [[United Nations Office in Vienna]] &lt;!-- (UNOV) --&gt; is one of the four major [[UN]] office sites worldwide.]]

Much like Germany, Austria was [[Allied-occupied Austria|divided]] into American, British, French, and Soviet zones and governed by the [[Allied Commission for Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 137&lt;/ref&gt; As forecast in the [[Moscow Declaration]] in 1943,  a subtle difference was seen in the treatment of Austria by the Allies.&lt;ref name="johnson 135" /&gt; The Austrian government, consisting of Social Democrats, Conservatives, and Communists (until 1947), and residing in Vienna, which was surrounded by the Soviet zone, was recognised by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] in October 1945 after some doubts that Renner could be Stalin's puppet. Thus, the creation of a separate Western Austrian government and the division of the country was avoidable. Austria, in general, was treated as though it had been originally invaded by Germany and liberated by the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;Manfried Rauchensteiner: Der Sonderfall. Die Besatzungszeit in Österreich 1945 bis 1955 (The Special Case. The Time of Occupation in Austria 1945 to 1955), edited by [[Heeresgeschichtliches Museum]] / Militärwissenschaftliches Institut (Museum of Army History / Institute for Military Science), Vienna 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May 1955, after talks which lasted for years and were influenced by the [[Cold War]], Austria regained full independence by concluding the [[Austrian State Treaty]] with the Four Occupying Powers. On 26 October 1955, after all occupation troops had left, Austria declared its "permanent neutrality" by an act of parliament.&lt;ref name="johnson 153"&gt;Lonnie Johnson 153&lt;/ref&gt; This day is now Austria's [[National Day]], a public holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.austria.org/national-day/ |title=The Austrian National Day |website=Austrian Embassy, Washington |language=en-US |access-date=2018-10-24 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|Austria joined the European Union in 1995 and signed the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007.]]

The political system of the [[Second Austrian Republic|Second Republic]] is based on the constitution of 1920 and 1929, which was reintroduced in 1945. The system came to be characterised by ''[[Proporz]]'', meaning that most posts of political importance were split evenly between members of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SPÖ) and the [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP).&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 139&lt;/ref&gt; Interest group "chambers" with mandatory membership (e.g. for workers, business people, farmers) grew to considerable importance and were usually consulted in the legislative process, so hardly any legislation was passed that did not reflect widespread consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 165&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1945, governing via a single-party government has occurred twice: 1966–1970 (ÖVP) and 1970–1983 (SPÖ). During all other legislative periods, either a [[grand coalition]] of SPÖ and ÖVP or a "small coalition" (one of these two and a smaller party) ruled the country.

[[Kurt Waldheim]], a Wehrmacht officer in the Second World War [[Austria — the Nazis' first victim#Waldheim Affair|accused of war crimes]], was elected President of Austria from 1986 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kurt Waldheim {{!}} president of Austria and secretary-general of the United Nations |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kurt-Waldheim |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=25 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a [[Austrian European Union membership referendum, 1994|referendum in 1994]], at which consent reached a majority of two-thirds, the country became a member of the [[European Union]] on 1 January 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 447,449&lt;/ref&gt;

The major parties SPÖ and ÖVP have contrary opinions about the future status of Austria's military nonalignment: While the SPÖ in public supports a neutral role, the ÖVP argues for stronger integration into the EU's security policy; even a future NATO membership is not ruled out by some ÖVP politicians (ex. Dr Werner Fasslabend (OVP) in 1997). In reality, Austria is taking part in the EU's [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]], participates in [[peacekeeping]] and peace creating tasks, and has become a member of [[NATO]]'s "Partnership for Peace"; the constitution has been amended accordingly. Since [[Liechtenstein]] joined the [[Schengen Area]] in 2011, none of Austria's neighbouring countries performs border controls towards it anymore.

[[File:WienParlament.jpg|thumb|The [[Austrian Parliament Building]] in Vienna.]]
[[File:Wien - Hofburg, Leopoldinischer Trakt.JPG|thumb|The Leopoldine Wing of [[Hofburg Imperial Palace]] in [[Vienna]], home to the offices of the [[Austrian president]].]]
The [[Parliament of Austria]] is located in [[Vienna]], the country's largest city and capital. Austria became a [[Federation|federal]], [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] through the [[Federal Constitution (Austria)|Federal Constitution]] of 1920. The political system of the Second Republic with its [[States of Austria|nine states]] is based on the constitution of 1920, amended in 1929, which was reenacted on 1 May 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 17, 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[head of state]] is the [[President of Austria|Federal President]] (''Bundespräsident''), who is directly elected by popular vote. The chairman of the [[Government of Austria|Federal Government]] is the [[Chancellor of Austria|Federal Chancellor]], who is appointed by the President. The government can be removed from office by either a presidential decree or by [[vote of no confidence]] in the lower chamber of parliament, the [[National Council of Austria|Nationalrat]]. Voting for the Federal President and for the Parliament used to be compulsory in Austria, but this was abolished in steps from 1982 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.gv.at/wahlen/elections_compulsorey_voting.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103221527/http://www.bmi.gv.at/wahlen/elections_compulsorey_voting.asp|archivedate=3 November 2007|title=Bundesministerium für Inneres – Elections Compulsory voting|publisher=Bmi.gv.at|accessdate=3 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parliament of Austria consists of two chambers. The composition of the Nationalrat (183 seats) is determined every five years (or whenever the Nationalrat has been dissolved by the federal president on a motion by the federal chancellor, or by Nationalrat itself) by a general election in which every citizen over 16 years (since 2007) has [[Suffrage|voting rights]]. While there is a general threshold of 4% for all parties at federal elections (Nationalratswahlen), there remains the possibility to gain a direct seat, or {{lang|de|Direktmandat}}, in one of the 43 regional election districts.

The Nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the formation of legislation in Austria. However, the upper house of parliament, the [[Federal Council of Austria|Bundesrat]], has a limited right of veto (the Nationalrat can—in almost all cases—ultimately pass the respective bill by voting a second time. This is referred to as '''Beharrungsbeschluss'', lit. "vote of persistence"). A convention, called the {{lang|de|Österreich -Konvent}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konvent.gv.at/ |title=Willkommen beim Österreich Konvent |publisher=Konvent.gv.at |accessdate=21 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090104001526/http://www.konvent.gv.at/| archivedate= 4 January 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; was convened on 30 June 2003 to decide upon suggestions to reform the constitution, but failed to produce a proposal that would receive the two-thirds of votes in the Nationalrat necessary for constitutional amendments and/or reform.

With legislative and executive, the courts are the third column of Austrian state powers. Notably the Constitutional Court (''Verfassungsgerichtshof'') may exert considerable influence on the political system by ruling out laws and ordinances not in compliance with the constitution. Since 1995, the [[European Court of Justice]] may overrule Austrian decisions in all matters defined in laws of the European Union. Austria also implements the decisions of the [[European Court of Human Rights]], since the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] is part of the Austrian constitution.

===Since 2006===
[[File:Wien - Bundeskanzleramt1.JPG|thumb|Federal Chancellery on Ballhausplatz.]]
After general elections held in October 2006, the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] (SPÖ) emerged as the strongest party, and the [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP) came in second, having lost about 8% of its previous polling.&lt;ref name="Election2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionresources.org/at/nationalrat.php?election=2002|title=24 November 2002 General Election Results – Austria Totals|year=2006|website=Election Resources on the Internet|accessdate=12 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Election2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionresources.org/at/nationalrat.php?election=2006|title=October&amp;nbsp;1st,&amp;nbsp;2006 General Election Results – Austria Totals|year=2006|website=Election Resources on the Internet|accessdate=12 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political realities prohibited any of the two major parties from forming a coalition with smaller parties. In January 2007 the People's Party and SPÖ formed a grand coalition with the social democrat [[Alfred Gusenbauer]] as Chancellor. This coalition broke up in June 2008.

Elections in September 2008 further weakened both major parties (SPÖ and ÖVP) but together they still held 70% of the votes, with the Social Democrats holding slightly more than the other party. They formed a coalition with [[Werner Faymann]] from the Social Democrats as Chancellor. The Green Party came in third with 11% of the vote. The FPÖ and the deceased [[Jörg Haider]]'s new party [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]], both on the political right, were strengthened during the election but taken together received less than 20% of the vote.

In the [[Austrian legislative election, 2013|legislative elections of 2013]], the Social Democratic Party received 27% of the vote and 52 seats; People's Party 24% and 47 seats, thus controlling together the majority of the seats. The Freedom Party received 40 seats and 21% of the votes, while the Greens received 12% and 24 seats. Two new parties, Stronach and the NEOS, received less than 10% of the vote, and 11 and nine seats respectively.

After the Grand Coalition broke in Spring 2017 a snap election was  proclaimed for [[Austrian legislative election, 2017|October 2017]]. The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) with its new young leader Sebastian Kurz emerged as the largest party in the National Council, winning 31.5% of votes and 62 of the 183 seats. The Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) finished second with 52 seats and 26.9% votes, slightly ahead of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), which received 51 seats and 26%. NEOS finished fourth with 10 seats (5.3 percent of votes), and PILZ (which split from the Green Party at the start of the campaign) entered parliament for the first time and came in fifth place with 8 seats and 4.4% The Green Party failed with 3.8% to cross the 4% threshold  and was ejected from parliament, losing all of its 24 seats. The ÖVP has decided to form a coalation with the FPÖ, the new government between the center-right wing and the right-wing populist party under the new chancellor Sebastian Kurz was sworn in on 18 December. 2017.

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Austria}}

[[File:Inauguration EYE2014 Parlement européen Strasbourg 9 mai 2014.jpg|thumb|The [[European Parliament]]: Austria is one of the 28 EU members.]]

The 1955 [[Austrian State Treaty]] ended the occupation of Austria following World War II and recognised Austria as an independent and sovereign state. On 26 October 1955, the [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Federal Assembly]] passed a constitutional article in which "Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality". The second section of this law stated that "in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory". Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality, but rather different from the neutrality of Switzerland.

Austria began to reassess its definition of neutrality following the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], granting overflight rights for the UN-sanctioned action against [[Iraq]] in 1991, and since 1995, it has developed participation in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. Also in 1995, it joined [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia. Meanwhile, the only part of the Constitutional Law on Neutrality of 1955 still fully valid is not to allow foreign military bases in Austria.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Austria attaches great importance to participation in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and other international economic organisations, and it has played an active role in the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE). As an OSCE-participating State, Austria's international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the [[U.S. Helsinki Commission]].

===Military===
{{Main|Austrian Armed Forces}}

The manpower of the Austrian Armed Forces ({{lang-de|link=no|Bundesheer}}) mainly relies on [[conscription]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} All males who have reached the age of eighteen and are found fit have to serve a six months compulsory [[military service]], followed by an eight-year reserve obligation. Both males and females at the age of sixteen are eligible for voluntary service.&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt; [[Conscientious objector|Conscientious objection]] is legally acceptable and those who claim this right are obliged to serve an institutionalised nine months [[Zivildienst in Austria|civilian service]] instead. Since 1998, women volunteers have been allowed to become professional soldiers.

The main sectors of the Bundesheer are Joint Forces (Streitkräfteführungskommando, SKFüKdo) which consist of Land Forces (Landstreitkräfte), Air Forces (Luftstreitkräfte), International Missions (Internationale Einsätze) and Special Forces (Spezialeinsatzkräfte), next to Joint Mission Support Command (Kommando Einsatzunterstützung; KdoEU) and Joint Command Support Centre (Führungsunterstützungszentrum; FüUZ). Austria is a [[landlocked country]] and has no navy.

In 2012, Austria's defence expenditures corresponded to approximately 0.8% of its GDP. The Army currently has about 26,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/defence-data-portal/Austria/year/2012|title=Defence Data|website=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; soldiers, of whom about 12,000 are conscripts. As head of state, [[President of Austria|Austrian President]] is nominally the Commander-in-Chief of the Bundesheer. Command of the Austrian Armed Forces is exercised by the Minister of Defence, {{as of|2018|March|lc=yes}}: [[Mario Kunasek]].

Since the end of the [[Cold War]], and more importantly the removal of the former heavily guarded "[[Iron Curtain]]" separating Austria and its [[Eastern Bloc]] neighbours ([[Hungary]] and former [[Czechoslovakia]]), the Austrian military has been assisting Austrian border guards in trying to prevent border crossings by [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]]. This assistance came to an end when Hungary and [[Slovakia]] joined the EU [[Schengen Area]] in 2008, for all intents and purposes abolishing "internal" border controls between treaty states. Some politicians have called for a prolongation of this mission, but the legality of this is heavily disputed. In accordance with the Austrian constitution, armed forces may only be deployed in a limited number of cases, mainly to defend the country and aid in cases of national emergency, such as in the wake of [[natural disaster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Austria 1920 (reinst. 1945, rev. 2013)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Austria_2013?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may generally not be used as auxiliary police forces.

Within its [[Declaration of Neutrality|self-declared status of permanent neutrality]], Austria has a long and proud tradition of engaging in UN-led peacekeeping and other humanitarian missions. The [[Austrian Forces Disaster Relief Unit]] (AFDRU), in particular, an all-volunteer unit with close ties to civilian specialists (e.g. rescue dog handlers) enjoys a reputation as a quick (standard deployment time is 10 hours) and efficient [[Search and rescue|SAR]] unit. Currently, larger contingents of Austrian forces are deployed in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Kosovo]].

===Administrative divisions=== &lt;!---"Administrative divisions of Austria" redirects here---&gt;
{{main|States of Austria}}
As a [[federal republic]], Austria is divided into [[States of Austria|nine states]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Bundesländer}}).&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt; These states are then divided into [[Districts of Austria|districts]] ({{lang|de|[[Bezirke]]}}) and statutory cities ({{lang|de|[[Statutarstadt|Statutarstädte]]}}). Districts are subdivided into municipalities ({{lang|de|Gemeinden}}). Statutory Cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities. The states are not mere administrative divisions but have some legislative authority distinct from the federal government, e.g. in matters of culture, social care, youth and nature protection, hunting, building, and zoning ordinances. In recent years, it has been discussed whether today it is appropriate for a small country to maintain ten parliaments.

=== Corrections system ===
 {{Disputed section|date=May 2018}}
The Ministry in charge of the Austrian corrections system is the Ministry of Justice.&lt;ref name="prisonstudies.org"&gt;“Austria.” Austria | World Prison Brief, 1 Jan. 1970, http://www.prisonstudies.org/country/austria.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Justice is based out of the UK and is supported through multiple European countries.&lt;ref name="prisonstudies.org"/&gt; The head of the prison administration falls under the title of Director General.&lt;ref name="prisonstudies.org"/&gt; The current Director General is Christian Schnattler. The total prison population rate {{as of|2017|July|lc=y}} is 8,290 people, and that does not include an additional 719 people in psychiatric care and home arrest.&lt;ref name="prisonstudies.org"/&gt; The prison population rate per 100,000 of national population is 94. The prison population rate has been fairly steady since 2010. The population percentages of the prison system is broken down into 4 categories with the percentages being from July 2017. The categories are pre-trial detainees, female prisoners, juvenile prisoners, and foreign prisoners. Pre-trial detainees make up 23.6%, female prisoners make up 5.7%, juveniles make up 1.4%, and foreign prisoners make up 54.2% of the prison system.&lt;ref name="prisonstudies.org"/&gt; The Austrian corrections system consists of 27 institutions, with an official capacity of 8,738 people. As reported in July 2017 they are currently at 94.9% maximum capacity(“Austria.”). The population percentage for Austria's prison system has had very little fluctuation since 2010. Since 2000 the population has risen over 2,000 and has stayed pretty well stabilized at over 8,000.&lt;ref name="prisonstudies.org"/&gt; Austria is ranked number 105 in prison pollution in the world("Highest to Lowest - Occupancy level (based on official capacity)”).

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Austria}}

Austria is a largely mountainous country due to its location in the [[Alps]].&lt;ref name="BritannicaAlps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/17356/Alps|title=Alps|date=11 June 2009|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=12 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090601083317/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/17356/Alps| archivedate= 1 June 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Central Eastern Alps]], [[Northern Limestone Alps]] and [[Southern Limestone Alps]] are all partly in Austria. Of the total area of Austria ({{convert|84000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), only about a quarter can be considered low lying, and only 32% of the country is below {{convert|500|m|ft|0}}. The Alps of western Austria give way somewhat into low lands and plains in the eastern part of the country.

Austria lies between latitudes [[46th parallel north|46°]] and [[49th parallel north|49° N]], and longitudes [[9th meridian east|9°]] and [[18th meridian east|18° E]].

It can be divided into five areas, the biggest being the [[Eastern Alps]], which constitute 62% of the nation's total area. The Austrian foothills at the base of the Alps and the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] account for around 12% and the foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery of the Pannoni low country amount to about 12% of the total landmass. The second greater mountain area (much lower than the Alps) is situated in the north. Known as the Austrian [[granite]] [[plateau]], it is located in the central area of the Bohemian Mass and accounts for 10% of Austria. The Austrian portion of the [[Vienna basin]] comprises the remaining 4%.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Austria belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Austria can be subdivided into four ecoregions: the Central European mixed forests, Pannonian mixed forests, Alps conifer and mixed forests and Western European broadleaf forests.

===Climate===
The greater part of Austria lies in the cool/temperate [[climate zone]], where humid westerly winds predominate. With nearly three-quarters of the country dominated by the Alps, the [[alpine climate]] is predominant. In the east—in the [[Pannonian Plain]] and along the [[Danube|Danube valley]]—the climate shows continental features with less rain than the alpine areas. Although Austria is cold in the winter (−10 to 0&amp;nbsp;°C), summer temperatures can be relatively high,&lt;ref name="Climate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT003350|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202042009/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT003350|archivedate=2 December 2010|title=Average Conditions, Vienna, Austria|year=2006|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with average temperatures in the mid-20s and a highest temperature of {{convert|40.5|°C|0}} in August 2013.&lt;ref name=ZAMG&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.zamg.ac.at/cms/de/klima/klimauebersichten/klimamittel-1971-2000|title= Austrian Meteorological Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Köppen Classification|Köppen Climate Classification]] Austria has the following climate types: [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic (Cfb)]], [[Humid continental climate|Cool/Warm-summer humid continental (Dfb)]], [[Subarctic climate|Subarctic/Subalpine (Dfc)]], [[Tundra climate|Tundra/Alpine (ET)]] and [[Ice cap climate|Ice-Cap (EF)]]. It is important to note though that Austria may experience very cold, severe winters, but most of the time they are only around as cold as those in somewhat comparable climate zones, for example Southern Scandinavia or Eastern Europe. As well, at higher altitudes, summers are usually considerably cooler than in the valleys/lower altitudes. The subarctic and tundra climates seen around the Alps are much warmer in winter than what is normal elsewhere due in part to the Oceanic influence on this part of Europe.&lt;ref name="ZAMG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://en.climate-data.org/country/4/|title= Climate-Data.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Atlantic influence on the Alps|journal= Environmental Research Letters|volume= 8|issue= 3|pages= 034026|doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034026|year= 2013|last1= Zampieri|first1= Matteo|last2= Scoccimarro|first2= Enrico|last3= Gualdi|first3= Silvio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:13-08-30-wien-by-RalfR-123.jpg|thumb|Modern [[Vienna]], [[Vienna International Centre]] with the [[United Nations Office at Vienna]] and the [[DC Towers|DC Tower 1]].]]

Austria consistently ranks high in terms of [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP per capita]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2009&amp;ey=2012&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=122&amp;s=NGDPD%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CLP&amp;grp=0&amp;a=&amp;pr.x=37&amp;pr.y=14 |title=Austria|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its highly industrialized economy, and well-developed [[social market economy]]. Until the 1980s, many of Austria's largest industry firms were nationalised; in recent years, however, [[Privatization|privatisation]] has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies. [[Labour movement]]s are particularly influential, exercising large influence on labour politics and decisions related to the expansion of the economy. Next to a highly developed industry, international tourism is the most important part of the [[economy of Austria]].

Germany has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the [[German economy]]. Since Austria became a member state of the [[European Union]], it has gained closer ties to other EU economies, reducing its economic dependence on Germany. In addition, membership of the EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to the single European market and proximity to the aspiring economies of the European Union. Growth in GDP reached 3.3% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oenb.at/isaweb/report.do?&amp;lang=EN&amp;report=7.7 Real GDP Growth – Expenditure Side], provided by the [[Oesterreichische Nationalbank|Austrian National Bank]] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 67% of Austria's imports come from other European Union member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OEC – Austria (AUT) Exports, Imports, and Trade Partners|url=http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/aut/|website=atlas.media.mit.edu|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BlueEurozone.svg|thumb|left|Austria is part of a monetary union, the [[eurozone]] (dark blue), and of the [[Internal Market (European Union)|EU single market]].]]

Austria indicated on 16 November 2010 that it would withhold the December installment of its contribution to the EU bailout of Greece, citing the material worsening of the Greek debt situation and the apparent inability of Greece to collect the level of tax receipts it had previously promised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mark |url=http://www.marksmarketanalysis.com/2010/11/austria-withholds-greek-bailout-funds.html |title=Mark's Market Analysis |publisher=Marksmarketanalysis.com |date=16 November 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110714035955/http://www.marksmarketanalysis.com/2010/11/austria-withholds-greek-bailout-funds.html |archivedate=14 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008]] dented the economy of Austria in other ways as well. It caused, for example, the [[Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International]] to be purchased in December 2009 by the government for 1 euro owing to credit difficulties, thus wiping out the €1.63bn of [[BayernLB]]. {{as of|2014|February}}, the HGAA situation was unresolved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-15/hypo-alpe-s-state-backed-bonds-cut-4-levels-on-insolvency-debate.html|title=Hypo Alpe Debt Cut Four Steps as Insolvency Not Ruled Out|first=Boris|last=Groendahl|work=Bloomberg.com|date=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing Chancellor [[Werner Faymann]] to warn that its failure would be comparable to the 1931 [[Creditanstalt]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-17/austria-s-faymann-channels-1931-creditanstalt-crash-on-hypo-alpe.html|title=Faymann Evokes 1931 Austria Creditanstalt Crash on Hypo Alpe|first=Boris|last=Groendahl|work=Bloomberg.com|date=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the fall of communism, [[List of Austrian companies|Austrian companies]] have been quite active players and consolidators in Eastern Europe.

In 1972, the country began construction of a [[nuclear power|nuclear-powered]] electricity-generation station at [[Zwentendorf]] on the River [[Danube]], following a unanimous vote in parliament. However, in 1978, a [[referendum]] voted approximately 50.5% against nuclear power, 49.5% for,&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 168–9&lt;/ref&gt; and parliament subsequently unanimously passed a law forbidding the use of nuclear power to generate electricity although the nuclear power plant was already finished.

Austria currently produces more than half of its electricity by [[hydropower]].&lt;ref name="RES"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.eu/renewables/factsheets/2008_res_sheet_austria_en.pdf|title=Austria Renewable Energy Fact Sheet|date=23 January 2008|format=PDF|website=Europe's Energy Portal|accessdate=20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with other [[renewable energy]] sources such as [[wind power|wind]], [[solar power|solar]] and [[biomass]] powerplants, the electricity supply from renewable energy amounts to 62.89%&lt;ref name="Renewables"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.eu/renewables/eu-charts/chart4.html|title=Renewable energy in Europe|year=2006|website=Eurobserv'er|publisher=Europe's Energy Portal|accessdate=20 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090520023020/http://www.energy.eu/renewables/eu-charts/chart4.html| archivedate= 20 May 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; of total use in Austria, with the rest being produced by [[Natural gas|gas]] and [[Petroleum|oil]] power plants.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Austria}}

[[File:AuVorarlberg5.JPG|thumb|Children in Austria, near [[Au, Vorarlberg]]]]

Austria's population was estimated to be nearly 9 million (8.83) in 2018 by the [[Statistik Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik.at/web_de/presse/075280|title=STATISTIK AUSTRIA – Presse|author=Statistik Austria|website=statistik.at}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the capital, [[Vienna]], exceeds 1.8 million&lt;ref name="Vienna pop" /&gt; (2.6&amp;nbsp;million, including the suburbs), representing about a quarter of the country's population. It is known for its cultural offerings and high standard of living.

Vienna is by far the country's largest city. [[Graz]] is second in size, with 265,778 inhabitants, followed by [[Linz]] (191,501), [[Salzburg]] (145,871), and [[Innsbruck]] (122,458). All other cities have fewer than 100,000 inhabitants.

According to [[Eurostat]], in 2010 there were 1.27 million foreign-born residents in Austria, corresponding to 15.2% of the total population. Of these, 764,000 (9.1%) were born outside the EU and 512,000 (6.1%) were born in another EU Member State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-034/EN/KS-SF-11-034-EN.PDF 6.5% of the EU population are foreigners and 9.4% are born abroad], Eurostat, Katya VASILEVA, 34/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistik Austria estimated in 2011 that 81% or 6.75 million residents&lt;ref name="medienservicestelle.at"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/293019/umfrage/auslaender-in-oesterreich-nach-staatsangehoerigkeit/ |format= |publisher=statista.com |title=Anzahl der Ausländer in Österreich nach den zehn wichtigsten Staatsangehörigkeiten am 1.

There are more than 415,000 descendants of foreign-born immigrants&lt;ref name="medienservicestelle.at"/&gt; residing in Austria, the great majority of whom have been naturalised.

185,592 [[Turkish people|Turks]]&lt;ref name="medienservicestelle.at"/&gt; (including a minority of Turkish [[Kurds]]) make up the second biggest single ethnic minority in Austria after [[Germans]] (2.5%), representing 2.2% of the total population.
13,000 Turks were naturalised in 2003 and an unknown number have arrived in Austria at the same time. While 2,000 Turks left Austria in the same year, 10,000 immigrated to the country, confirming a strong trend of growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2593717.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Back to school for Austria immigrants |publisher=BBC News |date=24 December 2002 |accessdate=25 March 2013 |first=Bethany |last=Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, [[Serbs]], [[Croats]], [[Bosniaks]] and [[Slovenes]] make up about 5.1% of Austria's total population.

The [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) in 2013 was estimated at 1.42 children born per woman,&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/au.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is lower than the replacement rate of 2.1.

===Language===
{{Main|Languages of Austria}}
[[Austrian German]] is Austria's official language and used in education, publications, announcements and websites. It is mostly identical to the German used in Germany but with some vocabulary differences. The German language is standardised between countries of German mother tongue, i.e., Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, as well as those with significant German speaking minorities: Italy, Belgium and Denmark. Many local dialects are spoken in Austria, and though their base is Austrian German, their corresponding speakers have certain degrees of difficulty when trying to understand each other.

According to the 2001 census, Austrian German is spoken natively by 88.6% of the population (including the 2.5% German citizens who reside in Austria) — followed by Turkish (2.28%), Serbian (2.21%), Croatian (1.63%), English (0.73%), Hungarian (0.51%), Bosnian (0.43%), Polish (0.35%), Albanian (0.35%), Slovenian (0.31%), Czech (0.22%), Arabic (0.22%), and Romanian (0.21%).&lt;ref name="Language" /&gt;

[[File:Continental West Germanic languages.png|thumb|The national and regional standard varieties of the German language]]

The Austrian federal states of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and [[Styria]] are home to a significant indigenous [[Carinthian Slovenes|Slovene-speaking minority]] while in the easternmost state, [[Burgenland]] (formerly part of the Hungarian portion of [[Austria–Hungary]]), there are significant [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]- and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]-speaking minorities. Of the remaining number of Austria's people that are of non-Austrian descent, many come from surrounding countries, especially from the former [[Eastern Bloc|East Bloc]] nations. [[foreign worker|Guest workers]] ''(Gastarbeiter)'' and their descendants, as well as refugees from the [[Yugoslav wars]] and other conflicts, also form an important [[minority group]] in Austria. Since 1994 the [[Romani people|Roma]]–[[Sinti]] (gypsies) have been an officially recognised ethnic minority in Austria.

According to census information published by [[Statistik Austria]] for 2001&lt;ref name="Language" /&gt; there were a total of 710,926 foreign nationals living in Austria. Of these, the largest by far are 283,334 foreign nationals from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]] (of whom 135,336 speak Serbian; 105,487 Croatian; 31,591 Bosnian – i.e. 272,414 Austrian resident native speakers in total, plus 6,902 Slovenian and 4,018 [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] speakers).

The second largest population of linguistic and ethnic groups are the [[Turkish people|Turks]] (including minority of [[Kurds]]) with a number of 200,000 to 300,000 who currently live in Austria. The Turks and the Kurds are the largest single immigrant group in Austria,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,488edfe22,49749d5cc,0.html "World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – Austria: Turks"].

The next largest population of linguistic and ethnic groups are the 124,392 who speak German as their [[First language|mother tongue]] even though they hail from outside of Austria (mainly immigrants from Germany, some from Switzerland, [[South Tyrol]] in Italy, [[Germans in Romania|Romania]], or the [[Germans in Russia|former Soviet Union]]); 123,417 English; 24,446 Albanian; 17,899 Polish; 14,699 Hungarian; 12,216 Romanian; 10,000 Malayali; 7,982 Arabic; 6,891 Slovak; 6,707 Czech; 5,916 Persian; 5,677 Italian; 5,466 Russian; 5,213 French; 4,938 Chinese; 4,264 Spanish; 3,503 Bulgarian. The numbers for other languages fall off sharply below 3,000.

In 2006, some of the Austrian states introduced standardised tests for new citizens, to assure their language ability, cultural knowledge and accordingly their ability to integrate into the Austrian society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wien.at/verwaltung/personenwesen/staatsbuergerschaft/allgem.html Requirements to become an Austrian citizen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102627/http://wien.at/verwaltung/personenwesen/staatsbuergerschaft/allgem.html |date=29 September 2007 }}, provided by the Viennese state government {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the national rules, see [[Austrian nationality law#Naturalization as an Austrian citizen|Austrian nationality law – Naturalisation]].

Historically [[Austrians]] were regarded as ethnic [[Germans]] and viewed themselves as such, although this national identity was challenged by [[Austrian nationalism]] in the decades after the end of World War I and even more so after World War II.&lt;ref name="Keyserlingk1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert H.

In 1871, Germany was [[Unification of Germany|founded as a nation-state]], Austria [[German question|was not a part of it]]. After World War I and the breakup of the Austrian monarchy, politicians of the new republic declared its name to be "Deutschösterreich" ([[Republic of German-Austria]]) and that it was part of the [[Weimar Republic|German Republic]]. A unification of the two countries was forbidden by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] as one of the conditions imposed by the victorious [[Allies of World War I]] upon the vanquished nation, to prevent the creation of a territorially extensive German state. After the events of World War II and [[Nazism]], Austria as a country has made efforts to develop an Austrian [[national identity]] among its populace{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}, and nowadays most do not consider themselves Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=derStandard.at |url=http://derstandard.at/3261105 |title=Österreicher fühlen sich heute als Nation |publisher=Derstandard.at |date=12 March 2008 |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a minority of Austrians still consider themselves to be Germans and advocate for a [[German Question|"Greater Germany"]], arguing that the historic boundaries of the German people goes beyond the boundaries of modern-day countries, especially Austria and Germany.

Following [[World War II]] the number of Serbs expanded again, and today the community is very large. The Austrian Serbian Society was founded in 1936. Today, Serbs in Austria are mainly found in [[Vienna]], [[Salzburg]], and [[Graz]].

An estimated 13,000 to 40,000 [[Slovenes]] in the Austrian state of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] (the [[Carinthian Slovenes]]) as well as [[Croats]] (around 30,000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croates.at/haupt/gesch_fr.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706090820/http://www.croates.at/haupt/gesch_fr.htm |archivedate=6 July 2011 |title=HKDC Geschichte – Frame |publisher=Croates.at |accessdate=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hungarians]] in Burgenland were recognised as a minority and have had special rights following the Austrian State Treaty ({{lang|de|Staatsvertrag}}) of 1955.&lt;ref name="johnson 153" /&gt; The Slovenes in the Austrian state of [[Styria]] (estimated at a number between 1,600 and 5,000) are not recognised as a minority and do not have special rights, although some believe the State Treaty of 27 July 1955 states otherwise.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The right for bilingual topographic signs for the regions where Slovene and Croat Austrians live alongside the German-speaking population (as required by the 1955 State Treaty) is still to be fully implemented in the view of some, while others believe that the treaty-derived obligations have been met (see below). Many Carinthians are afraid of [[Slovenia]]n territorial claims,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} pointing to the fact that Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two [[World war|World Wars]] and considering that some official Slovenian atlases show parts of Carinthia as Slovene cultural territory. The recently deceased governor, [[Jörg Haider]], has made this fact a matter of public argument in autumn 2005 by refusing to increase the number of bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia. A poll by the Kärntner Humaninstitut conducted in January 2006 states that 65% of Carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs, since the original requirements set by the State Treaty of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view.

Another interesting phenomenon is the so-called "[[:de:Windischen-Theorie|Windischen-Theorie]]" stating that the Slovenes can be split in two groups: actual Slovenes and ''Windische'' (a traditional German name for Slavs), based on differences in language between Austrian Slovenes, who were taught Slovene standard language in school and those Slovenes who spoke their local Slovene dialect but went to German schools. The term ''Windische'' was applied to the latter group as a means of distinction. This politically influenced theory, dividing Slovene Austrians into the "loyal Windische" and the "national Slovenes", was never generally accepted and fell out of use some decades ago.

In 2001, about 74% of Austria's population were registered as Roman Catholic,&lt;ref name="Volkszählung"&gt;{{cite web | title=Census 2001: Population 2001 according to religious affiliation and nationality|url=http://www.statistik.at/web_de/static/bevoelkerung_2001_nach_religionsbekenntnis_und_staatsangehoerigkeit_022894.pdf|accessdate=17 December 2007|language=German|publisher=Statistik Austria|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; while about 5% considered themselves [[Protestant]]s.&lt;ref name="Volkszählung" /&gt; Austrian Christians, both Catholic and Protestant,&lt;ref&gt;Tax is only mandatory for [[Lutherans]] and [[Reformed]].&lt;/ref&gt; are obliged to pay a mandatory membership fee (calculated by income—about 1%) to their church; this payment is called "Kirchenbeitrag" ("Ecclesiastical/Church contribution"). Since the second half of the 20th century, the number of adherents and churchgoers has declined. Data for 2017 from the Austrian Roman Catholic Church list 5,112,330 members, or 57.9% of the total Austrian population. Sunday [[church attendance]] was 605,828 or 7% of the total Austrian population in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katholisch.at/statistik|title=Katholische Kirche Österreichs, Statistik|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lutheran church also recorded a loss of 74,421 adherents between 2001 and 2016.

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Austria}}

[[File:Melk Stift Altstadt.jpg|thumb|[[Stiftsgymnasium Melk]] is the oldest Austrian school]]
Education in Austria is entrusted partly to the [[States of Austria|Austrian states]] (Bundesländer) and partly to the federal government. School attendance is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] for nine years, i.e. usually to the age of fifteen.

[[Pre-school]] education (called ''Kindergarten'' in German), free in most states, is provided for all children between the ages of three and six years and, whilst optional, is considered a normal part of a child's education due to its high takeup rate. Maximum class size is around 30, each class normally being cared for by one qualified teacher and one assistant.

Primary education, or [[Volksschule]], lasts for four years, starting at age six. The maximum class size is 30, but may be as low as 15. It is generally expected that a class will be taught by one teacher for the entire four years and the stable bond between teacher and pupil is considered important for a child's well-being. The [[The three Rs|3Rs]] (Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic) dominate lesson time, with less time allotted to project work than in the UK. Children work individually and all members of a class follow the same plan of work. There is no [[Streaming (education)|streaming]].

Standard attendance times are 8&amp;nbsp;am to 12&amp;nbsp;pm or 1&amp;nbsp;pm, with hourly five- or ten-minute breaks. Children are given homework daily from the first year. Historically there has been no lunch hour, with children returning home to eat. However, due to a rise in the number of mothers in work, primary schools are increasingly offering pre-lesson and afternoon care.

As in Germany, secondary education consists of two main types of schools, attendance at which is based on a pupil's ability as determined by grades from the primary school. The [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] caters for the more able children, in the final year of which the [[Matura]] examination is taken, which is a requirement for access to university. The [[Hauptschule]] prepares pupils for vocational education but also for various types of further education ([[Höhere Technische Lehranstalt]] HTL = institution of higher technical education; HAK = commercial academy; HBLA = institution of higher education for economic business; etc.). Attendance at one of these further education institutes also leads to the [[Matura]]. Some schools aim to combine the education available at the Gymnasium and the Hauptschule, and are known as [[Gesamtschule#Germany|Gesamtschulen]]. In addition, a recognition of the importance of learning English has led some Gymnasiums to offer a bilingual stream, in which pupils deemed able in languages follow a modified curriculum, a portion of the lesson time being conducted in English.

[[File:Wien - Universität (3).JPG|thumb|The [[University of Vienna]]]]
[[File:Wien 02 Campus WU a.jpg|thumb| The campus of the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business]]]]
As at primary school, lessons at Gymnasium begin at 8&amp;nbsp;am and continue with short intervals until lunchtime or early afternoon, with children returning home to a late lunch. Older pupils often attend further lessons after a break for lunch, generally eaten at school. As at primary level, all pupils follow the same plan of work. Great emphasis is placed on homework and frequent testing. Satisfactory marks in the end-of-the-year report ("Zeugnis") are a prerequisite for moving up ("aufsteigen") to the next class. Pupils who do not meet the required standard re-sit their tests at the end of the summer holidays; those whose marks are still not satisfactory are required to re-sit the year ("sitzenbleiben").

It is not uncommon for a pupil to re-sit more than one year of school. After completing the first two years, pupils choose between one of two strands, known as "Gymnasium" (slightly more emphasis on arts) or "Realgymnasium" (slightly more emphasis on science). Whilst many schools offer both strands, some do not, and as a result, some children move schools for a second time at age 12. At age 14, pupils may choose to remain in one of these two strands, or to change to a vocational course, possibly with a further change of school.

The Austrian university system had been open to any student who passed the [[Matura]] examination until recently. A 2006 bill allowed the introduction of entrance exams for studies such as Medicine. In 2001, an obligatory tuition fee ("''Studienbeitrag''") of €363.36 per term was introduced for all public universities. There are some non-state exceptions to this, where students can still study for a subsidized education, for example within the campus system of the [[English Teacher Training College]]. Since 2008, for all EU students the studies have been free of charge, as long as a certain time-limit is not exceeded (the expected duration of the study plus usually two terms tolerance).&lt;ref name="Tuition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.help.gv.at/Content.Node/148/Seite.1480000.html#tuition|title=Studying in Austria: Tuition Fee|date=1 January 2009|website=Help.gv.at|accessdate=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the time-limit is exceeded, the fee of around €363.36 per term is charged. Some further exceptions to the fee apply, e.g. for students with a year's salary of more than about €5000. In all cases, an obligatory fee of €17 is charged for the student union and insurance.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Austria}}
[[File:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1756–1791)]]

Austria's past as a European power and its cultural environment generated a broad contribution to various forms of art, most notably among them music. Austria was the birthplace of many [[Music of Austria|famous composers]] such as [[Haydn|Joseph Haydn]], [[Michael Haydn]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johann Strauss, Sr.]] and [[Johann Strauss, Jr.]] as well as members of the [[Second Viennese School]] such as [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]] and [[Alban Berg]]. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was born in [[Salzburg]], then an independent Church Principality of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which later became part of Austria, and much of Mozart's career was spent in Vienna.

Vienna was for a long time an important centre of musical innovation. 18th- and 19th-century composers were drawn to the city due to the patronage of the Habsburgs, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music. During the [[Baroque period]], Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music.

[[File:StateOperaViennaNightBackside.jpg|thumb|left|World-famous [[Vienna State Opera]]]]

Vienna's status began its rise as a cultural centre in the early 16th century, and was focused around instruments, including the [[lute]]. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] spent the better part of his life in Vienna. Austria's current [[national anthem]], attributed to Mozart, was chosen after [[World War II]] to replace the traditional Austrian anthem by Joseph Haydn.

Austrian [[Herbert von Karajan]] was principal conductor of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] for 35 years. He is generally regarded as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, and he was a dominant figure in European classical music from the 1960s until his death.&lt;ref name="NYT obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/17/obituaries/herbert-von-karajan-is-dead-musical-perfectionist-was-81.html|title=Herbert von Karajan Is Dead; Musical Perfectionist was 81|pages=A1|work=The New York Times|first=John|last=Rockwell|date=17 July 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International pop super star Johann Hölzel, also known by his stage name [[Falco (musician)|Falco]] was born in [[Vienna]], Austria 19 February 1957.

[[Conchita Wurst]] is also a renowned singer from the Austrian stock.

Contemporary artist Herbert Brandl.

===Cinema and theatre===
[[File:Michael Haneke 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Haneke]].]]
[[Sascha Kolowrat]] was an Austrian pioneer of filmmaking. [[Billy Wilder]], [[Fritz Lang]], [[Josef von Sternberg]], and [[Fred Zinnemann]] originally came from Austria before establishing themselves as internationally relevant movie makers. [[Willi Forst]], [[Ernst Marischka]], or [[Franz Antel]] enriched the popular cinema in German language speaking countries. [[Michael Haneke]] became internationally known for his disturbing cinematic studies, before receiving a [[Golden Globe]] for his critically acclaimed film ''[[The White Ribbon]]'' in 2010.

The first Austrian film director to receive an [[Academy Award]] was [[Stefan Ruzowitzky]]. A number of Austrian actors were able to pursue a career, the impact of which was sensed beyond national borders. Among them were [[Peter Lorre]], [[Helmut Berger]], [[Curd Jürgens]], [[Senta Berger]], [[Oskar Werner]], and [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]]. [[Hedy Lamarr]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] became American as well as international movie stars. The latter also became the 38th Governor of California. [[Christoph Waltz]] rose to international fame with his performance in ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', earning the [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor Award]] at [[Cannes]] in 2009, and the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] in 2010 and finally two Oscars. [[Max Reinhardt]] was a master of spectacular and astute theatre productions. [[Otto Schenk]] not only excelled as a stage actor, but also as an opera director.

===Science and philosophy===
{{Further|Austrian School|Vienna circle|List of Austrian scientists}}
[[File:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|right|[[Karl Popper]].]]
Austria was the cradle of numerous scientists with international reputation. Among them are [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Victor Franz Hess]] and [[Christian Doppler]], prominent scientists in the 19th century. In the 20th century, contributions by [[Lise Meitner]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] to nuclear research and [[quantum mechanics]] were key to these areas' development during the 1920s and 1930s. A present-day [[quantum physics|quantum physicist]] is [[Anton Zeilinger]], noted as the first scientist to demonstrate [[quantum teleportation]].

In addition to [[physics|physicists]], Austria was the birthplace of two of the most noteworthy philosophers of the 20th century, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]]. In addition to them, biologists [[Gregor Mendel]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]] as well as mathematician [[Kurt Gödel]] and engineers such as [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and [[Siegfried Marcus]] were Austrians.

A focus of Austrian science has always been medicine and psychology, starting in [[Medieval Times|medieval times]] with [[Paracelsus]]. Eminent physicians like [[Theodore Billroth]], [[Clemens von Pirquet]], and [[Anton Eiselsberg|Anton von Eiselsberg]] have built upon the achievements of the 19th-century Vienna School of Medicine. Austria was home to [[Sigmund Freud]], founder of [[psychoanalysis]], [[Alfred Adler]], founder of [[Individual psychology]], psychologists [[Paul Watzlawick]] and [[Hans Asperger]], and psychiatrist [[Viktor Frankl]].

The [[Austrian School]] of Economics, which is prominent as one of the main competitive directions for economic theory, is related to Austrian economists [[Carl Menger]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]]. Other noteworthy Austrian-born émigrés include the management thinker [[Peter Drucker]], sociologist [[Paul Felix Lazarsfeld]] and scientist [[Gustav Nossal|Sir Gustav Nossal]].

===Literature===
{{See also|List of Austrian writers|Austrian literature}}
[[File:Stefan Zweig2.png|thumb|[[Stefan Zweig]].]]
Complementing its status as a land of artists and scientists, Austria has always been a country of poets, writers, and novelists. It was the home of novelists [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], and [[Robert Musil]], of poets [[Georg Trakl]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Franz Grillparzer]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Adalbert Stifter]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] and children's author [[Eva Ibbotson]].

Famous contemporary playwrights and novelists are [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prize]] winner [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Peter Handke]] and [[Daniel Kehlmann]].

===Food and beverages===
{{Main|Austrian cuisine}}

Austria's cuisine is derived from that of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Austrian cuisine is mainly the tradition of Royal-Cuisine ("Hofküche") delivered over centuries. It is famous for its well-balanced variations of beef and pork and countless variations of vegetables. There is also the "Mehlspeisen" Bakery, which created particular delicacies such as Sachertorte, "Krapfen" which are doughnuts usually filled with apricot jam or custard, and "Strudel" such as "[[Apfelstrudel]]" filled with apple, "Topfenstrudel" filled with a type of cheese curd called "topfen", and "[[Millirahmstrudel]]" (milk-cream strudel).

In addition to native regional traditions, the cuisine has been influenced by [[Hungary|Hungarian]], Bohemia [[Czech Republic|Czech]], [[Jewish]], Italian, [[Balkan]] and French cuisine, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed. The Austrian cuisine is therefore one of the most multicultural and transcultural in Europe.

[[File:Wiener-Schnitzel02.jpg|thumb|[[Wiener Schnitzel]]]]

Typical Austrian dishes include [[Wiener Schnitzel]], Schweinsbraten, [[Kaiserschmarren]], [[Knödel]], [[Sachertorte]] and [[Tafelspitz]]. There are also Kärntner Kasnudeln, which are pockets of dough filled with Topfen, potatoes, herbs and peppermint which are boiled and served with a butter sauce. Kasnudeln are traditionally served with a salad. [[Cantharellus|Eierschwammerl]] dishes are also popular. The sugar block dispenser [[Pez]] was invented in Austria, as well as [[Manner (confectionary)|Mannerschnitten]]. Austria is also famous for its [[Mozartkugel]]n and its coffee tradition. With over 8&amp;nbsp;kg per year it has the sixth highest per capita coffee consumption worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43742686|title=Coffee: Who grows, drinks and pays the most?|last=Jones|first=Lora|date=2018-04-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beer is sold in 0.2 litre (a ''Pfiff''), 0.3 litre (a ''Seidel'', ''kleines Bier'' or ''Glas Bier'') and 0.5 litre (a ''Krügerl'' or ''großes Bier'' or ''Halbe'') measures. At festivals one litre ''Maß'' and two litre ''Doppelmaß'' in the [[Bavaria]]n style are also dispensed. The most popular types of beer are [[lager]] (known as ''Märzen'' in Austria), naturally cloudy ''Zwicklbier'' and [[wheat beer]]. At holidays like Christmas and Easter [[bock]] beer is also available.

The most important wine-producing areas are in [[Lower Austria]], [[Burgenland]], [[Styria]] and Vienna. The [[Grüner Veltliner]] grape provides some of Austria's most notable white wines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/grape-209-gruner-veltliner |title=Gruner Veltliner Wine |publisher=Wine-Searcher}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zweigelt]] is the most widely planted red wine grape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/grape-645-zweigelt |title=Zweigelt Wine |publisher=Wine-Searcher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Upper Austria]], Lower Austria, Styria and [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], ''Most'', a type of [[cider]] or [[perry]] is widely produced.

[[Schnapps]] of typically up to 60% alcohol or fruit [[brandy]] is drunk, which in Austria is made from a variety of fruits, for example [[apricot]]s and [[rowan]]berries. The produce of small private schnapps [[distillery|distilleries]], of which there are around 20,000 in Austria, is known as ''Selbstgebrannter'' or ''Hausbrand''.

Local soft drinks such as [[Almdudler]] are very popular around the country as an alternative to alcoholic beverages. Another popular drink is the so-called "Spezi", a mix between Coca-Cola and the original formula of [[Fanta|Orange Fanta]] or the more locally renowned [[Frucade]]. [[Red Bull]], the highest-selling energy drink in the world, was invented in Austria.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

A popular [[team sport]] in Austria is [[Association football|football]], which is governed by the [[Austrian Football Association]].&lt;ref name="Football"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oefb.at/|title=Österreichischer Fußballbund|year=2009|website=ÖFB|language=German|accessdate=17 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090628120811/http://www.oefb.at/| archivedate= 28 June 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austria was among the most successful football playing nations on the European continent placing 4th at the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]], 3rd at the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]] and 7th at the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]]. However, recently Austrian football has not been internationally successful. It also co-hosted the [[2008 UEFA European Football Championship]] with Switzerland. The national Austrian football league is the [[Austrian Bundesliga]], which includes teams such as record-champions [[SK Rapid Wien]], [[FK Austria Wien]], [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] and [[Sturm Graz]].

Besides football, Austria also has professional national leagues for most major team sports, including the [[Austrian Hockey League]] for [[ice hockey]], and the [[Österreichische Basketball Bundesliga]] for basketball. Horseback riding is also popular; the famed [[Spanish Riding School of Vienna]] is located in Vienna.

[[Niki Lauda]] is a former [[Formula One]] driver who was three times F1 World Champion, winning in 1975, 1977 and 1984. He is currently the only driver to have been champion for both Ferrari and McLaren, the sport's two most successful constructors. Other known Austrian F1 drivers are for example [[Gerhard Berger]] and [[Jochen Rindt]]. Austria also hosts F1 races ([[Austrian Grand Prix]]); now held at [[Red Bull Ring]], in the past also at [[Österreichring]] and [[Zeltweg Airfield]].

[[Thomas Muster]] is a former [[tennis]] player and one of the greatest clay courters of all time. He won the [[1995 French Open]] and in 1996 he was ranked [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|number 1]] in the [[ATP Rankings|ATP Ranking]]. Other known Austrian tennis players are for example [[Horst Skoff]], [[Jürgen Melzer]] and [[Dominic Thiem]].

Sport played a significant role in developing national consciousness and boosting national self-confidence in the early years of the Second Republic after World War II, through events such as the [[Tour of Austria]] cycle race and through sporting successes such as the national football team's run to third at the 1954 World Cup and the performances of Toni Sailer and the rest of the "Kitzbühel Miracle Team" in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marschick |first=Matthias |date=Summer 2011 |title=Austrian Sport and the Challenges of Its Recent Historiography |jstor=10.5406/jsporthistory.38.2.189 |journal=Journal of Sport History |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=189–198 |doi=10.5406/jsporthistory.38.2.189  |doi-broken-date=2018-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Norden |first=Gilbert|date=Spring 2001 |title=Austrian Sport Museums |url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2001/JSH2801/JSH2801h.pdf |journal=Journal of Sport History |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=87–107|access-date=3 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Babin Republic''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Rzeczpospolita Babińska''), was a satirical, literary and carnival society founded in 1568 in [[Babin (Lublin Voivodeship)|Babin]], [[Lublin]] county, [[Poland]] by [[Stanisław Pszonka]] and {{ill|Piotr Kaszowski|pl}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Polak|first1=Agnieszka|title=Rzeczpospolita Babińska – chronologia dziejów|url=http://teatrnn.pl/leksykon/node/3188/rzeczpospolita_babi%C5%84ska_%E2%80%93_chronologia_dziej%C3%B3w|website=Teatr NN Leksykon Lublin|accessdate=29 August 2014|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its Latin motto was: ''Omnis Homo Mendax'' ("Every man is a liar").

The Babin Republic was set up as a parody of a republican state. To this end, the Republic bestowed sarcastic "offices" and "titles" to those who embarrassed themselves in public due to some fault or folly, and to those who told ridiculously untrue stories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v7wPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA4 ''A New Miscellany of Humour, Literature, and the Fine Arts''] p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; People with poor speaking skills were declared "Speakers of the Republic", gossipmongers were made members of the "Secret Council", litigious people were declared "Justices of the Peace", people who exaggerated their hunting exploits were made "Masters of the Hunt", etc. All nominations were dutifully entered into the ''Memorial Register of Babin Officials''. There was a total of 411 accounts in the register. Some of the fanciful stories show influences of [[Rabelais]] and [[Boccaccio]]. The society was an institution in the cultural life in post-[[Renaissance]] Poland and survived until 1677. The Babin Republic spawned a few humorous expressions in Polish of the time, such as ''rycerz z Babina'' ("a Babin knight"), meaning "coward", or ''wiesci z Babina'' ("news from Babin"), meaning "false rumors".

'''The Battle of Sauðafell''' (''Orrustan á Sauðafelli'') occurred in 1550, when the forces of Catholic Bishop [[Jón Arason]] clashed with the forces of Daði Guðmundsson of Snóksdalur.

==Location==
Sauðafell was an important part of Daði's [[fief]] in West of Iceland, close to his Estate in Snóksdalur and vital to the Bishops campaign against [[Lutheran]] influence in the country as it blocked his [[lines of communication]] in the West to the South of Iceland.

==The battle==
[[Jón Arason]] brought with him a minimal force of around 100 men and took Sauðafell without opposition initially. Daði responded by secretly raising an [[Military elite|elite force]] of similar size from his followers, half of which was heavily armored ''sveinar'' and half unarmored but equipped with guns. Mounted and covered in gray cloaks they marched under the cover of dark and foggy weather unnoticed by the Bishop's forces, surprising them early in the morning. The battle was nonetheless close fought and Daði was almost shot down by gunfire when he led his troops into the fray.

After being cornered in the Church the Bishop accepted Daði's terms and surrendered.

[[File:San Marino cathedral.jpg|thumb|San Marino Co-cathedral]]
==History==
San Marino is a predominantly Catholic state — over 97% of the population profess the Catholic faith, but Catholicism is not an established religion.  There is no episcopal see in San Marino. Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian dioceses, mostly in the [[Diocese of Montefeltro]], and partly in the [[Diocese of Rimini]]. In 1977, the border between [[Montefeltro]] and [[Rimini]] was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. The [[bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino]] resides in [[Pennabilli]], in [[Italy]].

==Parishes==
There are several parishes in the Republic, including:&lt;ref name="Vatican"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19920402_santa-sede-rep-s-marino_it.html |title=CONCORDATO FRA LA SANTA SEDE E LA REPUBBLICA DI SAN MARINO |date=December 1992 |publisher=The Vatican |accessdate=3 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630223931/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19920402_santa-sede-rep-s-marino_it.html |archivedate=30 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Hulbe grew up in [[Sacramento, California]], spending a lot of time in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and the [[Warner Mountains]] to the north. Her father was a geologist and professor (at [[Sacramento City College]] and [[Sacramento State University]]). She completed a degree in geological engineering from the Montana College of Mineral Science and Technology. She completed her MSc in 1994 at [[Ohio State University]] followed in 1998 by a [[Geophysics]] PhD from the [[University of Chicago]].

== Career and impact ==
In 1998 she held a NRC Research Associateship, [[Goddard Space Flight Center|NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.]]  From there she moved to Portland State University in Portland, Oregon.

Her work in the late 1990s constituted the first melding together of the types of ice-sheet thermomechanical models (simulating ice-stream dynamics embedded within the flow of the inland ice sheet that behaves according to a different set of dynamics). She contributed to the understanding of ice-shelf instability, with some of the first papers that identified surface meltwater as an agent in the break-up of [[Larsen Ice Shelf|Larsen B ice shelf]] (in 2002).

She has developed methods used to identify ice-shelf and ice-stream flow variability as observed by the geometry of flow streaks and other indicators, and this is one of the few ways in which the history of glacial flow over the “medium past” (the past between the reach of direct observation and the more distant reach of ice coring).

Hulbe’s work in the understanding of Heinrich Events of the North Atlantic was informed by her experience with Antarctic-based ice-shelf and ice-stream instability (and sedimentology), and this has led to a mechanism that is currently popular in understanding Heinrich Events (the idea of deeper waters warming and destabilizing an ice shelf in the Labrador Sea is her idea).  Most recently, Hulbe is lead investigator in a New Zealand project seeking to drill through the [[Ross Ice Shelf]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/362424/ice-research-could-help-protect-city|title=Ice research could help protect Dunedin {{!}} Otago Daily Times Online News : Otago, South Island, New Zealand &amp; International News|website=www.odt.co.nz|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would be the first mid-shelf penetration since J9 in the late 1970s.

Hulbe has been heavily involved with the [[International Glaciological Society]] (IGS) and over-saw its transition from a mode of service to the community to an open access publishing provider.

== Awards and honours ==
Hulbe was Vice President (2009 – 2012) of the International Glaciological Society as well as a [[Fulbright Senior Scholar]] (New Zealand, 2009).  She was awarded the Portland State University College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, John Elliot Allen Outstanding Teaching Award in 2004 and 2007.  She also chairs the University of Otago Equity Advisory Committee and has written a history of women in glaciology and has campaigned extensively against armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, Tom H. ''Nonviolent response to terrorism''. McFarland, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hulbe Glacier]] on the [[Siple Coast]] is named after her.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Ruins of the Church of the Virgin Mary in the Prague Castle.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Ruins of the Church of the Virgin Mary]]

The '''Church of the Virgin Mary''' was the first known church built in the current area of the [[Prague Castle]].  The structure was built by Prince [[Borivoj I]] after 884, making it not only the oldest church in Prague Castle but also the second oldest in [[Bohemia]].  The church was rebuilt after a fire in the 11th century, but was eventually destroyed again in the 13th century and not rebuilt; it is known today due to excavations directly under extant administrative buildings.  The surviving foundations indicate a rectangular [[nave]] and a semicircular [[apse]]; archaeological surveys uncovered tombs for members of the royal [[Přemyslid dynasty]] which was prominent in Bohemia during the early Christian era.

In [[French mythology]] or [[French folklore|folklore]], '''Dames Blanches''' (meaning literally '''white [[lady|ladies]]''') were female spirits or supernatural beings, comparable to the [[Weiße Frauen|White Women]] of both Dutch and Germanic mythology. The Dames Blanches were reported in the region of [[Lorraine (région)|Lorraine]] (Lotharingen) and [[Normandy]]. They appear (as ''Damas blancas'', in Occitan), in the [[Pyrenees]] mountains, where they were supposed to appear near caves and caverns.

[[Thomas Keightley (historian)|Thomas Keightley]] (1870) describes the Dames Blanches as a type of Fée known in Normandy "who are of a less benevolent character." They lurk in narrow places such as ravines, fords, and on bridges, and try to attract passerby attention. They may require one to join in her dance or assist her in order to pass. If assisted she "makes him many courtesies, and then vanishes." One such Dame was known as ''La Dame d'Apringy'' who appeared in a ravine at the Rue Quentin at [[Bayeux]] in Normandy, where one must dance with her a few rounds to pass. Those who refused were thrown into the thistles and briar, while those who danced were not harmed. Another Dame was known on a narrow bridge in the district of [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]], named the Pont d'Angot. She only allowed people to pass if they went on their knees to her. Anyone who refused was tormented by the [[lutin]]s, cats, owls, and other creatures who helped her.&lt;ref&gt;Keightley 1870.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
J. A. MacCulloch believes ''Dames Blanches'' are one of the recharacterizations of pre-Christian female goddesses, and suggested their name Dame may have derived from the ancient guardian goddesses known as the [[Matres]], by looking at old inscriptions to guardian goddesses, specifically inscriptions to "the ''Dominæ'', who watched over the home, perhaps became the ''[[knight|Dame]]s'' of mediæval folk-lore."&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch 1911:46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dames Blanches have close counterparts in both name and characterization in neighboring northern countries: In Germany the [[Weisse Frauen]] and in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Low Countries the [[Witte Wieven]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1547">'''Ganutell''' is a [[Malta|Maltese]] art form of making [[artificial flower]]s from wire, thread, and beads.

In his introduction to the book ''Ganutell'' by Maria Kerr, the Maltese scholar and historian [[Guido Lanfranco]] states that in Maltese eighteenth and nineteenth century history, one finds numerous references to ganutell which can be considered to be the Maltese art of making artistic [[flower]]s. The word ''ganutell'' is derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''cannotiglio'' and in fact this craft, which can also be considered to be an art, was "imported" to Malta during the eighteenth century from mainland Europe. The way the craft eventually evolved has made it distinctively Maltese.

This craft had its ups and downs and by the mid-twentieth century a considerable section of the Maltese population hardly knew of the existence of ganutell and only a few had mastered the various techniques of ganutell. The techniques had been passed on from generation to generation by word of mouth with little or no [[documentation]] until it seemed that this craft was destined to be forgotten.

Towards the end of the twentieth century, the Education Division offered evening courses in ganutell and the craft started on its way to recovery. Today it is known not only in Malta but interest has been shown from a number of European countries, North and South America and also in Japan.{{Fact|date=April 2009}}

The '''''Geprüfte Sicherheit''''' ("Tested Safety") or '''''GS''''' mark is a voluntary [[certification mark]] for technical equipment. It indicates that the equipment meets [[Germany|German]] and, if available, European safety requirements for such devices. The main difference between GS and [[CE mark]] is that the compliance with the European safety requirements has been tested and certified by a state-approved independent body.&lt;ref name="tuv-gsmark"&gt;[http://www.tuv.com/en/corporate/business_customers/product_testing_3/our_ervices_1/gs_mark_2/gsmark.html TÜV Rheinland: GS Mark – A Product Safety Mark for German Market]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuvps.co.uk/product-certification.asp www.tuvps.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dincertco.de/en/competencies/our_marks_of_conformity/gs_mark.php |title=www.dincertco.de/en |access-date=2006-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430205036/http://www.dincertco.de/en/competencies/our_marks_of_conformity/gs_mark.php |archive-date=2006-04-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CE marking, in contrast, is issued for the signing of a '''declaration''' that the product is in compliance with European legislation. The GS mark is based on the German Product Safety Act ("Produktsicherheitsgesetz", or "ProdSG").&lt;ref name="tuv-gsmark"/&gt;

Testing for the mark is available from many different [[laboratory|laboratories]], such as,&lt;ref&gt;Intertek&lt;/ref&gt; '''DGUV Test''' [[Technischer Überwachungsverein|the TÜV]], [[NEMKO|Nemko]] and '''IMQ'''.

Although the GS mark was designed with the German market in mind, it appears on a large proportion of electronic products and machinery sold elsewhere in the world.

The '''Grotta-Pelos culture''' ({{lang-el|Γρόττα-Πηλός}}) refers to a "cultural" dating system used for part of the early [[Bronze Age]] in [[Greece]].&lt;ref name="Cline"&gt;Eric H. Cline (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of the Bronze Age Aegean'', {{ISBN|9780199873609}}, Jan. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it is the period that marks the beginning of the so-called [[Cycladic culture]] and spans the [[Neolithic]] period in the late [[4th millennium BC]] (ca. 3300 BC), continuing in the Bronze Age to about 2700 BC.
The term was coined by [[Colin Renfrew, Baron Renfrew of Kaimsthorn|Colin Renfrew]], who named it after the sites of Grotta and Pelos on the [[Cyclades|Cycladic]] islands of [[Naxos]] and [[Milos]], respectively. Other archaeologists prefer a [[Chronological dating|"chronological" dating]] system and refer to this period as the '''Early Cycladic I (ECI)'''.

[[File:Le Blond, Guillaume – Eléments de fortification, 1752 – BEIC 1446424.jpg|thumb|''Eléments de fortification'', 1752]]

He was a professor of mathematics at the grand stable of the King (1736) and then the [[Fils de France|Enfants de France]] (1756). Leblond kept this job until 1778, when he became secretary of the cabinet of [[Madame Victoire]].

Le Blond wrote the following works, some of which have been translated into [[German language|German]].

* ''Essai sur la castramétation'', 1748, in-8°) ;
* ''Éléments de tactique'', 1758, in-4° ;
* ''Artillerie raisonnée contenant l’usage des différentes bouches à feu'', 1761, in-8° ;

* ''Traité de l’attaque des places'', 1780, in-8° ;
* ''Éléments de fortification'', 1739, in-8°.

He also produced editions of ''Mémoires d’artillerie'' by [[Pierre Surirey de Saint-Remy]] and the ''Géométrie'' by [[Joseph Sauveur]] and collaborated on the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''.

'''Intelsat II''' was a series of four [[communications satellite]]s operated by [[Intelsat]] which were launched in 1966 and 1967. Built by the [[Hughes Aircraft Company]], the Intelsat II series was a follow-up to the [[Intelsat I]] series, of which only one satellite was launched.

Intelsat II spacecraft were based on the [[HS-303A]] [[satellite bus]], which was cylindrical in shape and [[spin-stabilisation|spin-stabilised]]. The satellites had a diameter of {{convert|1.42|m}}, and were {{convert|0.67|m}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/boeing/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/376/intelsat_ii/intelsat_ii.page|title=Intelsat II|publisher=Boeing|accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were equipped with an [[SVM-1]] [[apogee motor]] to circularise their orbits following launch atop [[Delta E|Delta E1]] carrier rockets. All four satellites were launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17B]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Kennedy Air Station]]. Each satellite had a mass at launch of {{convert|162|kg}}, which decreased to around {{convert|86|kg}} once the satellite had fired its apogee motor and manoeuvred into its orbital position.&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-2.htm|title=Intelsat-2|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelsat II spacecraft were designed to be operated in [[geostationary orbit]]; however the first satellite's apogee motor malfunctioned leaving it in a lower than planned orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harland|first=David M|author2=Lorenz, Ralph D.|title=Space Systems Failures|publisher=Springer-Praxis|location=Chichester|date=2005|edition=2006|isbn=0-387-21519-0|page=20}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It was able to perform a limited communications mission, however the other three spacecraft successfully achieved geostationary orbit. Each satellite carried two [[transponder]]s, powered by [[solar cell]]s mounted on the body of the spacecraft, which generated 85&amp;nbsp;watts of power.

==Operations==
Intelsat II F-1 provided a transpacific communications link for 240 telephone channels or two television channels. Provision was made for 180 hours of telecasting per year (an average of 30 minutes per day) via the satellite.&lt;ref name="stripes196701"&gt;{{Cite news|title=U.S.-Japan Television Link Opens With 50-Minute Show|url=|newspaper=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]|date=January 28, 1967|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 50-minute programme was relayed between [[Tokyo]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] via Intelsat II F-1 on 27 January 1967. It was the first newscast and the first colour programme to be telecast across the Pacific. Japan's [[Fuji Television]] used the satellite to present direct telecasts of the world [[featherweight]] [[boxing]] title match between [[Vicente Saldivar]] and [[Mitsunori Seki]] from [[Mexico City]] on 29 January.&lt;ref name="stripes196701" /&gt; It was the first live transmission of a sport event across the Pacific. ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' reported that the pictures were clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Lanibird Filled the (TV) Bill|url=|newspaper=Stars and Stripes|date=February 1, 1967|pages=18&amp;ndash;19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Još Hrvatska ni propala''''' ({{lang-en|"Croatia Has Not Yet Fallen"}}) is a famous [[Croats|Croatian]] patriotic [[reveille]] which was penned by [[Ljudevit Gaj]] and set to music by the composer [[Ferdo Livadić]] in 1833. The song is considered the anthem of the [[Illyrian Movement]], which constituted a great part of the Croatian [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]].
The song is strikingly similar to Polish [[Poland Is Not Yet Lost|Mazurek Dąbrowskiego]]. 

Gaj's story of how the song came about was related in [[Franjo Kuhač]]'s work ''Illyrian Songwriters'' (''Ilirski glazbenici''). Travelling to [[Samobor]] to visit Livadić, Gaj thought to himself, "Croatia has not yet fallen so long as we [revivalists] are alive". At the same time he heard the sound of villagers singing in church. When he arrived at Livadić's house, he already had the words and melody ready. That night they penned several other verses, of which three became the best known and were treated as the unofficial anthem of the Illyrian Movement. 

The song was first performed publicly on February 4, 1835 in a Zagreb theatre.

&lt;poem&gt;
Još Hrvatska ni propala dok mi živimo,
visoko se bude stala kad ju zbudimo.
Ak je dugo tvrdo spala, jača hoće bit,
ak je sada u snu mala, će se prostranit.

Hura! nek se ori i hrvatski govori!

Ni li skoro skrajnje vrijeme da nju zvisimo,
ter da stransko teško breme iz nas bacimo?
Stari smo i mi Hrvati, nismo zabili
da smo vaši pravi brati, zlo prebavili.

Hura! nek se ori i hrvatski govori!

Oj, Hrvati braćo mila, čujte našu riječ,
razdružit nas neće sila baš nikakva već!
Nas je nekad jedna majka draga rodila,
hrvatskim nas, Bog joj plati, mlijekom dojila.

Hura! nek se ori i hrvatski govori!
&lt;/poem&gt;
|
&lt;poem&gt;
Croatia has not yet fallen while we live,
it will rise high when we revive it.
If it's slept this hard and long, it will grow stronger,
if it's so small in its sleep, it will expand.

'Hurrah!' let it resound, spoken in Croatian!

Isn't it high time to uplift her,
and throw away the heavy foreign burden?
Us Croats, we are old too, we did not forget
that we are your true brethren, regardless of the evil.

'Hurrah!' let it resound, spoken in Croatian!

Oh, Croats, dear brothers, hear us when we say,
there is no force that will separate us now!
One dear mother gave birth to us once,
breastfed us Croatian milk, thank God for that.

'Hurrah!' let it resound, spoken in Croatian!
&lt;/poem&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4847">'''Košava''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Кошава}}, {{IPA-sr|kɔ̌ʃaʋa|pron}}) is a cold, very [[squall]]y southeastern [[wind]] found in [[Serbia]] and some nearby countries.  It starts in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and follows the [[Danube]] northwest through the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]] region where it gains a [[Mountain jet|jet effect]], then continues to [[Belgrade]].  It can spread as far north as [[Hungary]] and as far south as [[Niš]].&lt;ref name=AMS&gt;{{cite web|title=Kossava|work=Glossary of Meteorology, Second Edition|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=kossava1|accessdate=2007-03-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930211835/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=kossava1|archivedate=2007-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the winter, it can cause temperatures to drop to around {{convert|-30|C}}.  In the summer, it is cool and dusty.  It varies [[Day|diurnal]]ly, and is strongest between 5:00 and 10:00 in the morning.  Košava is usually caused by a low [[Atmospheric pressure|pressure]] zone over the [[Adriatic Sea]] and a corresponding high pressure zone in southern [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=AMS/&gt;

The name is also used traditionally in northwestern [[Bulgaria]] to mean a southeastern or eastern wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umotvorenia.bgrod.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=182&amp;Itemid=48|title=Народни умотворения и вярвания: Вятър|publisher=Родово наследство|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2008-10-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070701/http://umotvorenia.bgrod.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=182&amp;Itemid=48|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.hit.bg/hinko/Weather.htm|title=Какво ще бъде времето утре|publisher=Caves / Пещери|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2008-10-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209082340/http://web.hit.bg/hinko/Weather.htm|archivedate=2008-12-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exists the saying: "When košava blows, the [[Nišava River|Nišava]] freezes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protobulgarians.com/Statii%20za%20prabaalgarite/Dialektni%20dumi%20-%2021%20may%202007/Dialektni%20dumi%20-%20K-L-M.htm|title=Речник на оригинални старобългарски и диалектни думи  и думи, свързани с българската етнография (к-л-м)|last=Иванов|first=Иван Танев|publisher=Страница за прабългарите|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2008-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The speed and occurrence of the Košava wind declined from 1949 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Romanić|title=Long-term trends of the ‘Koshava’ wind during 1949-2010|journal=International Journal of Climatology|date=2015|volume=35|issue=3|pages=288–302|doi=10.1002/joc.3981|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.3981/abstract|accessdate=11 March 2015|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2015IJCli..35..288R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study showed that Košava usually lasts for two or three days, one-day events being very rare.

Koshava wind blows when there is a high air pressure (an anticyclone) over eastern Europe and/or west Asia and a low pressure (a cyclone) over the middle and/or western Mediterranean region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Romanić|title=Contributing factors to Koshava wind characteristics|journal=International Journal of Climatology|date=2015|doi=10.1002/joc.4397|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.4397/abstract|accessdate=20 August 2015|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2016IJCli..36..956R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The strong anticyclone, however, is the main trigger for the Koshava wind. Koshava is also a gap flow windstorm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Romanić|title=Contributing factors to Koshava wind characteristics|journal=International Journal of Climatology|date=2015|doi=10.1002/joc.4397|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.4397/abstract|accessdate=20 August 2015|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2016IJCli..36..956R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koshava's occurrence can be successfully forecast using the across-mountain [[mean sea level pressure]] and [[potential temperature]] differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Romanić|title=Contributing factors to Koshava wind characteristics|journal=International Journal of Climatology|date=2015|doi=10.1002/joc.4397|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.4397/abstract|accessdate=20 August 2015|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2016IJCli..36..956R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kunal''' is a pre-Harappan settlement located in [[Fatehabad district|Fatehabad]] district, [[Haryana]], India. This [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] site was a village, in comparison to towns like [[Kalibangan]] and cities like [[Rakhigarhi]] of IVC. This site is located on [[Sarasvati]] plain.&lt;ref name=jane/&gt;

==Historical significance==

===Button seal===
Discovery of a button seal during 1998-99 excavations by [[Archaeological Survey of India]] exhibit this culture's ancestry to the [[Rehman Dheri]] examples.&lt;ref name=asi1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Archaeological Survey of|first=India|title=Excavations at Kunal,Haryana|journal=Indian Archaeology 1998-99 A Review|year=2004|pages=11–12|url=http://asi.nic.in/nmma_reviews/Indian%20Archaeology%201998-99%20A%20Review.pdf|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seal contained a picture of two deer on one side and a geometrical pattern on other side, which is comparable to a specimen from Rehman-Dheri ([[Baluchistan]]), datable to {{circa|4000 BCE}}.&lt;ref name=asi1/&gt;

===Earliest pre-Harappan===
This site is recognised as earliest Pre-Harappan site.&lt;ref name=jane/&gt;

==Findings==
Designs on pottery included pipal leaves (''ficus religiosa'') and humped bull&lt;ref name=singh/&gt; which were important motifs found on Mature Harappan seals. Bone tools, micro blades made of chalcedony,copper fish hooks and arrow heads were also found here.&lt;ref name=singh/&gt; Six steatite seals and one shell seal with geometric patterns were found.&lt;ref name=singh/&gt; These six seals were of square shape, made of grey stone and resembled typical Mature Harappan seals.&lt;ref name=jane/&gt;
Also found at this site are copper rods, rings, bangle pieces, terracotta objects like bangles, balls, animal figurines,net-sinker, toy cart frames,disk and toys, stone balls, shell bangles etc.&lt;ref name=asi1/&gt;

===Hoards===
Large Hoards of jewellery were found at this location, including two silver pieces called tiaras, gold ornaments, beads of semi precious stones etc.&lt;ref name=singh/&gt; Number of hoards found at this site included silver bangle, copper tools etc.&lt;ref name=jane&gt;{{cite book|last=McIntosh|first=Jane R.|title=The Ancient Indus Valley : New Perspectives|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=9781576079072|pages=68, 80,82,105,113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=jane+mcintosh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XwsBUJnZIMLHrQeD4umaBg&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kunal&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copper smelting===
Excavations on south-west side of mound revealed copper furnaces with smelting material and copper ingots and slags were also found at this site.&lt;ref name=asi1/&gt;

===Rice===
Rice (probably wild) is found from Kunal as well as from [[Balu, Haryana|Balu]], both in Haryana.&lt;ref name=jane/&gt;

'''MLB Extra Innings''' is an [[Out-of-Market Sports Package]] distributed in [[North America]] by satellite provider DirecTV since 2010&lt;ref name="baseballprospectus1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown |first=Maury |url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=5796 |title=Baseball Prospectus.com |publisher=Baseball Prospectus.com |date=2007-01-08 |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by most cable providers since 2001.&lt;ref name="baseballprospectus1"/&gt; The package allows its subscribers to see up to 80 out-of-market [[Major League Baseball]] games a week using local over the air stations and [[regional sports networks]].

As of the [[2008 in baseball|2008 season]], the feeds from both teams' broadcasts are available for each game on [[DirecTV]], even if a team is showing the game locally on a [[terrestrial television|broadcast station]]. Even though the package relies on satellite uplink paths, DirecTV also carries feeds from local broadcast and even cable-only networks as well, such as [[NBC Sports Philadelphia]] for the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. Feeds that are not included on the DirecTV version of Extra Innings include [[KCAL-TV|KCAL]] (Dodgers), [[KCOP-TV]] (Angels), [[KNTV]] (Giants), and [[WCIU-TV|WCIU]] (Cubs and White Sox) unless that is your local area.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The [[In Demand|iN DEMAND]] version of Extra Innings added the "dual feed" system for select broadcasts after the [[2008 MLB All-Star Game]]. Along with this, the [[In Demand|iN DEMAND]] version of MLB Extra Innings has been able to add broadcast television stations, [[WKYC-TV|WKYC]] (Indians), [[WJZ-TV]] (Orioles), [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]] (Nationals), [[WPIX]] (Mets, Yankees), [[WPHL-TV]] (Phillies), and in addition, one Canadian [[Regional Sports Network|RSN]], the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]' [[Rogers Sports Net]] feed. Previously, only one feed was available, usually the home team's.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} For the 2017 season, Comcast X1 customers could get all MLB EI games in HDTV, using the Beta IN DEMAND platform. DirecTV has offered all MLB EI (Most with dual HD feeds) games in HDTV for years.

Free previews of MLB Extra Innings are shown during the first week of the season, and the week after the All Star Game.

[[Dish Network]] offered the package from 2004–2006, but as of January 2013, Dish was still not offering MLB Extra Innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dishnetwork.com/packages/ppv/sports/baseball/ |title=Dish Network Official Site - MLB Extra Innings Information |publisher=Dishnetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the status, the satellite provider began carrying the [[MLB Network]] on September 1, 2011. On March 29, 2015, Dish announced it will again offer MLB Extra Innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.dish.com/press-release/programming/dish-now-offering-mlb-extra-innings |title=DISH Now Offering MLB EXTRA INNINGS |publisher=Dishnetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New contract and controversy==
On March 6, 2007, [[DirecTV]] signed a new seven-year carriage contract with the MLB. At first, it was to be an exclusive deal worth $700 million. However, as a result of viewer complaints and [[antitrust]] concerns –voiced by, among others, [[Massachusetts]] [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[John Kerry]]– MLB agreed to offer the package for renewal by [[cable television|cable systems]] and [[Dish Network]]. By March 9, negotiations had begun to try to settle the dispute, with a deadline of April 1, the first day of the [[2007 in baseball|MLB regular season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/sports/baseball/mlb/la-sp-bbnotes10mar10,1,4100317.story?coll=la-headlines-sports-majorbaseb ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLB demanded that the cable systems bundle the renewal of the Extra Innings package with the [[MLB Network]], a 24-hour network in the vein of [[NFL Network]], [[NBA TV]], and [[NHL Network (United States)|NHL Network]] that MLB launched on January 1, 2009. Furthermore, these systems were asked to place the channel on an expanded digital tier. At least one major system, [[Time Warner Cable]], balked at the terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/baseball/mlb/la-sp-baseballtv9mar09,1,3165588.story?coll=la-headlines-sports-majorbaseb |title=Baseball TV deal goes through, with a twist - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date=2007-03-09 |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offer from the cable consortium to MLB would have matched the financing portion, but cable was only willing to put the MLB Network on a premium tier. Cable systems did guarantee to reach at least as many viewers of MLB Network as DirecTV will reach. MLB was not satisfied with the offer, and publicly claimed that the cable companies failed to meet more of the criteria for the deal than they had actually met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/baseball/mlb/03/21/extra.innings.ap/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328212126/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/baseball/mlb/03/21/extra.innings.ap/index.html |date=March 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while MLB wanted the cable systems to match the same offer as DirecTV, MLB would be providing more generous benefits to DirecTV for the very same offer: DirecTV would be receiving a stake in MLB Network, thereby barring cable systems from receiving the telecasts. Hence, MLB was accused of claiming that cable would not meet the same terms as DirecTV, while not offering the same deal to the cable consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brady |first=Shirley |url=http://www.cable360.net/competition/dbs/22652.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721121303/http://www.cable360.net/competition/dbs/22652.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-21 |title=MLB's Extra Innings Gets Senate Hearing |publisher=Cable360 |date=2007-03-26 |accessdate=2011-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the start of the season on April 2, only DirecTV had agreed to those terms and was able to retain Extra Innings. It would not be available on any cable system until after the deadline was extended and agreements were reached.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

On April 4, MLB and [[In Demand|iN DEMAND]] finally reached an agreement similar to the one that MLB reached with DirecTV. Cable companies that carry [[In Demand|iN DEMAND]] resumed carrying MLB Extra Innings and also agreed to add the MLB Network upon its launch. iN DEMAND only had the authority to negotiate directly for and agree to add the MLB Network on their owners' cable systems which are made up by [[Comcast]], [[Time Warner Cable]], [[Cox Communications]] and [[Advance Publications|Advance/Newhouse]] ([[Bright House Networks]]); in turn, iN DEMAND got an equity stake in the MLB Network about the same as the one [[DirecTV]] received. [[Cablevision]] which had been asking for their own equity stake as terms for them to agree to add the MLB Network came to terms with iN DEMAND and Major League Baseball on May 4, 2007 which was iN DEMAND and MLB's deadline for cable companies and Dish Network to reach a deal. Dish never came to an agreement and did not carry the package until a new deal was reached with MLB on March 31, 2015. Cablevision agreed to carry the MLB Network without getting the equity stake in it. [[Charter Communications]] also reached an agreement with MLB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20070404&amp;content_id=1879904&amp;vkey=pr_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=MLB announces iN DEMAND deal &amp;#124; MLB.com: Official Info |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

iN DEMAND places MLB Extra Innings on the same channels as its [[NHL Center Ice]] service. Some providers, like [[Comcast]] and [[Suddenlink Communications]], may not offer all 14 MLB game channels. Because of hockey games shown on the same channels (particularly in April), some nights on Comcast and Suddenlink see no more than 2 or 3 games being shown. Some Comcast cable systems do carry all 14 game channels, while some systems have limited number of channels. DirecTV customers do not have this problem, as their 15 channels (mostly [[Regional sports network|RSN]] remaps) are dedicated solely to baseball.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Additional "Superfan" feature==
In 2008, MLB Extra Innings on DirecTV launched a "Superfan" premium package similar to that available from [[NFL Sunday Ticket]]. This included a "Game Mix" with eight games on the same channel, and a "Strike Zone Channel" with live cut-ins to the night's games. It was commercial free and also available in HD.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

DirecTV subscribers with the Superfan package also received access to up to 40 games in [[high-definition television|HD]] each week. In 2007, at least 10 games each week were in HD. HD equipment is required. Superfan cost an additional $50 on top of the MLB Extra Innings package subscription cost as well as requires one to subscribe to the $9.99 HD monthly access fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadgethd.com/2008/04/03/directvs-mlb-extra-innings-superfan-gets-down-with-hd/ |title=DirecTV's MLB Extra Innings SuperFan gets down with HD |publisher=Engadget HD |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the 2009 MLB season, "Superfan" no longer was offered as an option with MLB Extra Innings on DirecTV. Instead, the up to 40 HD games per week were part of the base package, provided to subscribers who already possess HD-ready equipment, and who paid the aforementioned HD monthly access fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/global/contentPageNR.jsp?assetId=3180002&amp;footernavtype=-1 |title=MLB EXTRA INNINGS : The Most Baseball on TV |publisher=Directv |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blackout restrictions==
{{Update|date=May 2012}}

===USA===
Game broadcasts of a major league team in its home market are [[blackout (broadcasting)|blacked out]] in that area if the same game is on the Extra Innings schedule. In most cases, these games can be seen locally on a broadcast or cable/satellite network. (If both feeds are available, as noted above, they are both blacked out.){{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Games broadcast exclusively on [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]] are not available on Extra Innings. Beginning in the 2014 season, [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] broadcasts not shown on a local affiliate are available on Extra Innings.

Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox games formerly broadcast nationally via [[WGN America]] but still shown on [[WGN-TV]] in the Chicago area are available through the DirecTV version of Extra Innings as of the 2015 season. This also is the case for Cubs games televised by [[WLS-TV]].

ESPN has exclusive broadcast rights for Sunday evening games. Any game starting after 5:10 p.m. Eastern on Sundays will not be broadcast on MLB Extra Innings. ESPN also televises a number of other games throughout the week. These, however, are not blacked out.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In North Carolina, Time Warner persistently refuses to carry the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN), which means all Washington Nationals and Baltimore Orioles games - home and away - are blacked out because MLB includes the state in those teams' broadcast territory.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Canada===
{{See also|Toronto Blue Jays#Radio and television}}
[[Image:Canadian MLB Blackout map.PNG|right|thumb|300px|Canadian [[Major League Baseball blackout policy|MLB Blackout]] map]]
Nationally-broadcast [[Toronto Blue Jays]] games and [[Sunday Night Baseball]] are not made available on Extra Innings and are available on [[Sportsnet]] and [[TSN2]] respectively. All remaining televised games, including [[Major League Baseball on Fox]], [[ESPN Major League Baseball]] and [[Major League Baseball on TBS]] are shown without exclusivity. [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]] games broadcast on [[WGN-TV]] and [[New York Mets]] games on [[WPIX-TV]] are not blacked out. Out-of-market and shared territory games that air on Sportsnet's regional feeds are not blacked out, but may be subject to improper use of the [[simultaneous substitution]] rules.

==Package price history==

'''Malino I Declaration''' or '''Malino Declaration for Poso''', is a [[peace treaty]] initiated by the [[government of Indonesia]] on December 20, 2001 in [[Malino, Indonesia|Malino]], [[Gowa Regency]], [[South Sulawesi]]. This agreement brought together [[Christianity in Indonesia#Sulawesi|Christian]]s and [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslims]] who fought in [[Poso]] in [[Poso riots|communal conflict from 1998 to 2001]], also known as Poso riots. The meeting was chaired by the Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare at the time, [[Jusuf Kalla]].&lt;ref name = DAVE1&gt; {{cite book  | title = A Few Poorly Organized Men: Interreligious Violence in Poso, Indonesia | last = McRae | first = Dave  | page = 30 | date = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By agreeing on the clauses of Malino Declaration, two commissions were established: the Commission on Security and Law Enforcement, and the Socio-Economic Commission. The Security Commission has two main responsibilities: firstly, within the field of security, focus on disarming and repatriation of the [[Internally displaced person|refugee]]s; secondly, within the field of law enforcement.&lt;ref name = HAM1&gt; {{cite web | url = http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/session13/ID/Komnas_Perempuan_UPR_IDN_S13_2012_KomnasPerempuan_Annex7_E.pdf | title = Komnas Perempuan HAM UPR IDN S13 2012 | website = [[Komnas Perempuan]] | access-date = 1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Socio-Economic Commission was tasked with ten programs: reconciliation, social rehabilitation,
repatriation of the refugees, life insurance, physical rehabilitation, normalization of citizen economic activities, social support, development of parenting program, regular evaluation and monitoring, and program developments related to all of these. This program is administered by the Ministry of Social Affairs (Poso Social Service), with the exception of the reconciliation funds being controlled by the Poso Regional Government and the Malino Working Group 1.

The amount allocated by the central government to restore the condition of [[Poso Regency]] reached up to 54 million [[rupiah]].&lt;ref name = SA1&gt; {{cite book |last= Alam |first= Syamsul |authorlink= Syamsul Alam |title= Context of Poso Conflict |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central government has also implemented several programs for victims and refugees of the conflict. In addition, the Poso reconciliation program was also planned as the next step of the Malino Declaration.&lt;ref name = TK1&gt; {{cite book | url = |isbn = 9792237631 | title = Indonesian Top Secret: Unpacking Poso Conflict |last= Karnavian |first= Tito |authorlink= Tito Karnavian | page = |date=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''My Seven Sons''''' ({{lang-az|Yeddi Oğul İstərəm}}) is a 1970 [[Azerbaijan]]i [[drama film]]. The film plot is written by Yusif Samedoglu based on his father poet [[Samed Vurgun]]'s ''The Komsomol Poem'' which is about the events of 1920's and the Soviet overtaking of Azerbaijan.

The title "Yeddi Oğul İstərəm" derives from Azerbaijani folklore clause ''Yeddi Oğul İstərəm, Bircə Dənə Qız Gəlin'' (meaning "I'd like seven sons and just one daughter"), usually said during the weddings, when the groom comes to the bride's house to pick her up. The movie was shot for the 50th anniversary of establishment of Soviet power in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3160">'''Ondřej Havelka and his Melody Makers''' ({{lang-cs|Ondřej Havelka a jeho Melody Makers}}) or simply '''The Melody Makers''', is a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] retro-band, playing American "[[jazz standards]]" and Central European jazz and swing music of the 1920s and 1930s. Carefully studied renditions of the original recordings are interspersed with solos improvised in a style authentic to the period. They are one of very few European [[big band]] formations in continual existence over more than a decade, and have been a considerable presence on the swing scene of post-Communist [[Central Europe]].

==History==
The [[Original Prague Syncopated Orchestra]] split in 1995, actor and singer [[Ondřej Havelka]] with his colleague Karel Majer leaving to form their own ensemble, with Havelka as artistic director and [[lead vocalist]], and Majer initially as [[bandleader]] but leaving after a year. This group eventually adopted the name "Melody Makers".

In recent years the group has performed a number of songs best known from [[Ella Fitzgerald]]'s recordings, with [[Romani people in the Czech Republic|Gypsy]] singer [[Věra Gondolánová]] as guest vocalist.

'''Willis' Battery''' is a former [[artillery battery]] on the north side of the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. It overlooks the [[isthmus]] between Spain and Gibraltar.

The battery was originally built during the period of [[Spanish Gibraltar|Spanish rule over Gibraltar]] and was known as ''Batería de San Joaquín''. It was renamed, as was the adjoining plateau, after a British artillery officer called Willis who distinguished himself during the 1704 [[Capture of Gibraltar]]. The battery was the first British battery on [[Willis' Plateau]], mounting two guns, and saw active service during the [[Thirteenth Siege of Gibraltar]] in 1727. Although it was {{convert|440|ft}} above sea level, it proved vulnerable to Spanish bombardment and its guns were dismounted by enemy fire. They were positioned very close to the cliff edge with little protection other than a thin wall to prevent their carriages from rolling over the precipice.&lt;ref name="Hughes381"&gt;{{cite book|title=Strong as the Rock of Gibraltar|last1=Hughes|first1=Quentin|last2=Migos|first2=Athanassios|publisher=Exchange Publications|year=1995|page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The battery underwent major changes following the siege. [[Merlon]]s made of casks filled with stones were installed to provide protection from bombardment and the number of cannon was increased to nine. More improvements were made between 1730–45 when two magazines were constructed. During the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1762–63)|Anglo-Spanish War]] of 1762–63 Willis' Battery was equipped with six 8-inch mortars and twenty-two 4.66-inch Coehorn mortars.&lt;ref name="Hughes381" /&gt;

Intensive Spanish bombardment during the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]] (1779–83) caused heavy damage to Willis' Battery, which had to be repaired by the summer of 1781. The British defenders constructed caissons – wooden frames filled with rammed clay and topped with pieces of old rope – which were placed on the ramparts of the battery. This proved to be a very effective means of capping the ramparts and improving the guns' protection from enemy fire.&lt;ref name="Hughes381" /&gt;

The battery was expanded to mount 34 guns by 1859. In May 1906, a proposal was advanced to mount two 12-pdr. quick-firing guns at [[Willis' Magazine]].&lt;ref name="Hughes381" /&gt;
