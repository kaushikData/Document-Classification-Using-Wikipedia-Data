:''For the [[binomial nomenclature]] term, see [[List_of_Latin_and_Greek_words_commonly_used_in_systematic_names#A|acutus, acuta]]''.
'''ACUTA''' was a North American [[nonprofit association]] whose core purpose was to support higher education [[communications technology]] professionals in contributing to the achievement of the strategic mission of their institutions. It was founded in 1972 by telecommunications managers or directors and disbanded March 22, 2017.  The association had grown with the evolution of technology to include voice, data and video professionals. ACUTA, which stood for the Association of College and University Telecommunications Administrators, later the Association for Information Communications Technology Professionals in Higher Education. The group retained the acronym ACUTA to capitalize on its reputation and recognition that span 46 years.

Membership in ACUTA resided with the college and university, and these institutions were represented within the association by the men and women responsible for planning, implementing and maintaining voice and data networks throughout campus. A number of Canadian institutions give ACUTA a presence across North America. Companies that provide products and services relevant to the provision of voice, data and video were also invited to become corporate affiliates. Its membership included more than 700 college and university members, and about 150 corporate affiliates.

The group specialized in educational opportunities and professional networking, offering two seminars and one major conference each year in addition to numerous web seminars. Its website provided immediate access to numerous resources, an active listserv offers useful information as members interact with peers, and the publications program provides a monthly electronic newsletter and a quarterly journal as well as other materials that address issues of relevance and importance. ACUTA also worked closely with a Washington law firm to provide up-to-date information from the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] and [[U.S. Congress|Congress]].

The ACUTA board of directors voted to dissolve on March 22, 2017.

'''Angelo Jank''' (30 October 1868 in [[Munich]] – 9 October 1940 in Munich) was a German [[animal painter]], illustrator and member of the [[Munich Secession]]. He specialized in scenes with horses and riders.

== Biography ==
After graduating from the [[Wilhelmsgymnasium (Munich)|Wilhelmsgymnasium]] in 1888, he studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts]] from 1891 to 1896 with [[Ludwig von Löfftz]] and [[Paul Hoecker]] and exhibited with several art societies at the [[Glaspalast (Munich)|Glaspalast]]. In 1898, he had his first showing with members of the Munich Secession.

From 1899 to 1907, he was a teacher at the Women's Academy of the Munich Artists' Association. He was then appointed a Professor at the Academy of Fine Arts, succeeding [[Wilhelm von Diez]]. In 1922, following the retirement of [[Heinrich von Zügel]], Jank succeeded him as Professor of Animal Painting. Later, he was elected first Chairman of the "Association of Visual Artists" and presided over their exhibitions at the Glaspalast. For many years, he was also employed as an illustrator for the magazines ''[[Jugend (magazine)|Jugend]]'' and ''[[Simplicissimus]]'',  And he was also an instructor at the Academy of Fine Arts, where his students included [[Karl Gatermann the Younger]].

He was married to Baroness Anna von Thüngen, from an old noble family, some of whose members became involved with the [[Nazi Party]]. His daughter, Ali, married [[Riedesel|Bertram Riedesel]], Freiherr zu Eisenbach. Another child of the marriage was their son Hans Jank (his wife was Märta, née Larsson), whose daughter Angela married Prince Albrecht of [[Oettingen-Spielberg]]. An affair with the painter, [[Marie Schnür]], produced a son named Klaus. Schnür later entered into a [[marriage of convenience]] with [[Franz Marc]] to provide legitimacy for the boy.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte Salmen, ''Maria Marc. Leben und Lebenswerk'', from: ''Maria Marc im Kreis des "Blauen Reiter"'' (exhibition catalog), Schloßmuseum Murnau, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Block letters'''  (known as '''printscript''', '''manuscript''', '''print writing''' or '''ball and stick''' in academics) are a [[sans-serif]] (or "gothic") style of writing [[Latin script]] in which the letters are individual [[glyph]]s, with no joining. In English-speaking countries, children are often first taught to write in block letters, and later may be taught [[cursive]] (joined) writing. In Germany, children start writing with block letters in the first grade and learn cursive writing from the second grade. Other countries (Dominican Republic, Poland, Italy, Austria, France, Romania, etc.) focus on cursive writing from the first grade.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

On official forms, one is often asked to "please print". This is because cursive handwriting is harder to read, and the glyphs are joined so they do not fit neatly into separate boxes.

Block letters may also be used as a synonym of '''block capitals''', which means writing in [[all caps|all capital letters]] or in [[Small caps|large and small capital letters]], imitating the style of typeset capital letters. This is not a necessary implication, however: in at least one court case involving patents, trademarks and registration of designs, the term "block letters" was found to include both [[letter case|upper and lower case]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/foia/ttab/2dissues/1998/98191.pdf Fossil Inc v The Fossil Group]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boyd Henry Bode''' (October 4, 1873 &amp;ndash; March 29, 1953) was an [[Americans|American]] [[Academia|academic]] and [[Philosophy|philosopher]], notable for his work on [[philosophy of education]].

Bode was born in [[Ridott, Illinois]]. He grew up in rural areas of [[Iowa]] and [[South Dakota]] and attended [[Pennsylvania College]] in [[Iowa]] and later the [[University of Michigan]], where he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1897, and [[Cornell University]], where he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1900.

Bode became assistant professor of philosophy at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] (1900-1909) and was later appointed professor of philosophy at [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] (1909-1921). In 1910 Bode published ''An Outline of Logic''.

In 1921 Bode became professor of education at [[Ohio State University]]. There Bode wrote on philosophy of education and authored ''Fundamentals of Education'' (1921), ''Modern Educational Theories'' (1927), ''Conflicting Psychologies of Learning'' (1929), ''Democracy as a Way of Life'' (1937), ''Progressive Education at the Crossroads'' (1938), and ''How We Learn'' (1940). He agreed with many of the ideas of [[John Dewey]], especially on [[pragmatism]]. Bode retired in 1944. He died in 1953 in [[Gainesville, Florida]].

From 1911 to 1912 Bode served as vice president of the [[American Philosophical Association]].

==Life==
[[File:Ballard, Bernice, Mrs., with Buzzer the cat, portrait photograph.jpg|thumb|Bernice Ballard with Buzzer the cat, portrait photograph]]
Boyd Bode was the son of Henry Bode and Gertrude Weinenga.  His father was a minister of the First Christian Reformed Church and he also farmed.  In 1848, his family was part of a religious migration of Germans to the United State.  In the 1870s his family bought farm land and moved to Iowa.  Bode had seven younger brothers and sisters and he was the only one to pursue an education.  He earned his degree in 1896 from [[William Penn College]] in Oskaloosa, Iowa.  Bode achieved another A.B. at the University of Michigan.  He then earned his Ph.D. at [[Cornell University]] in 1900.  Bode married Bernice Ballard and had two children in 1903.  
Bode’s realistic approach to educational philosophy mimicked that of John Dewey.  From 1900 to 1909 he was a professor of philosophy and philosophy of education at the University of Wisconsin.  He left Wisconsin and moved to Illinois to become involved in the university’s department of education.  While at the University of Illinois he published An Outline of Logic, which in the field of philosophy, launched him into becoming a young scholar.  
Bode received a great compliment and was asked to come to Ohio State University to become a professor in education and head the Department of Principles and Practices of Education.  This was his first time not teaching philosophy and instead education.  However, he continued preaching the philosopher’s cynicism and concern for logic while teaching education.  Instead of a typical lecture during class, Bode approached a different way of teaching by questioning and challenging his students.  He was very well liked by his colleagues and this is shown in a quote from Ralph Tyler who worked with him at Ohio State University, “My admiration for his keen intelligence, his persistent questioning, and his ready wit led me to become a good friend of Bode’s.”  This quote shows just how well liked and admired Bode was for his significance to education.  
In 1927, he came out with another triumphant publication titled Modern Educational Theories.  Bode felt school and education was to be the establishments which allowed social equality to become a way of life.  He made this clear in two more publications titled Democracy as a Way of Life and Progressive Education at the Crossroads.  Bode retired in 1944 and had several bridge jobs taking positions in Cairo, Egypt, and several universities as a teacher.  In 1946 he accepted an offer of being the graduate lecturer in philosophy at the University of Florida where he spent the rest of his life until his death in 1953.

'''Domonique Bertolucci''' (born 1970 in [[Perth, Australia]]) is an Australian happiness expert, life coach, and author of several books. She is the founder and principal of the Domonique Bertolucci Company, which delivers personal development programs. She previously worked as a model and independent consultant before founding her own firm.&lt;ref name=blue&gt;{{cite web| title =Domonique Bertolucci| work =Business Blueprint| url =http://www.businessblueprint.com/profiles/domonique-bertolucci/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clax&gt;{{cite web| title =Speakers Profile – Domonique Bertolucci| work =Claxton Speakers International| url =http://www.claxtonspeakers.com.au/speakers_profile/1240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has written several books that focus on happiness and life-coaching, giving readers the tools to live better lives, including her novels, ''Your Best Life'' in 2006 and ''The Happiness Code'' in 2012. Bertolucci has become a prominent life strategist and happiness coach, with more than ten million people having “seen, read, or heard” her lessons.&lt;ref name=blue/&gt;&lt;ref name=clax/&gt;

==Biography==
Bertolucci was born in Perth, Western Australia. She is of Italian ancestry. At an early age she began modelling and at 22 moved to London to pursue this as a career. However, dissatisfied with this, she soon changed careers and became a project manager and independent consultant for a range of [[investment bank]]s. For ten years she consulted several firms on optimising systems and processes, as well as team-building and success techniques. During her time in a corporate setting she developed a number of techniques for team success and workplace achievement.&lt;ref name=blue/&gt;&lt;ref name=clax/&gt;

However she has stated that she lacked a sense of fulfilment and desired a lifestyle and career change. Her desire was to hold a meaningful and enjoyable position, as well as lead a passionate and fulfilling home life. She did not foresee her career in financiall troubleshooting offering her the chance at true happiness and therefore quit her job to found her own firm, Success Strategies, rebranded in 2006 as Domonique Bertolucci Company. When asked about her motivations, Bertolucci said "I have always been a positive, motivated person, but there was a time when I didn't feel like I was living my best life. Things were certainly going well and my life looked good on paper: a former model, a well-paid corporate job, a nice house, car and boyfriend. But I felt like I was living someone else’s life; my success felt two-dimensional.”&lt;ref name=blue/&gt;&lt;ref name=clax/&gt;

She has recounted that she eventually hit a “quarter-life crisis” where, although everything in her life seemed sufficient, she expected more and felt unfulfilled. She soon realised there was a different path to happiness that she had to take. Using the expertise she had gained while developing teams, she created a method to success which she began to teach. She worked as a life coach and a success coach, which she defines as similar to a 'life coach' but generally dealing with both life and business challenges for entrepreneurial and senior executive clients.&lt;ref name=blue/&gt;&lt;ref name=clax/&gt;

==Writing and career==
Returning to Australia in 2003 to found her own firm, Success Strategies, she began working with corporate and entrepreneurial clients, teaching them optimal techniques in leadership, personal motivation, and achieving success. Her firm offers several courses and workshops in personal development programs for both the general public and companies who recognise the economic impact of efficient and content employees..” In 2006, she re-branded her firm as the Domonique Bertolucci Company (DBC).&lt;ref name=blue/&gt;&lt;ref name=clax/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|last=Aedy|first=Richard| title =Business owners and coaching| work =Australian Broadcasting Corporation| date =19 June 2006| url =http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/lifematters/business-owners-and-coaching/3329392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is a speaker for professional settings. Bertolucci has developed a criterion of goal-setting for her clients and readers that involves ranking values and prioritising those most important, called the Personal Happiness Prescription.&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite web| last =Sheedy| first =Margie| title =So you want to ... negotiate more money| work =Sydney Morning Herald| date =24 June 2006| url =http://www.smh.com.au/news/mentor/so-you-want-to--negotiate-more-money/2006/06/23/1150845347499.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tele2&gt;{{cite web| last =Bertolucci| first =Domonique| title =10 steps to lifelong happiness | work =Daily Telegraph| date =10 November 2012| url =http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/steps-to-lifelong-happiness/story-fnejo9jl-1226514162687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bertolucci believes that personal happiness is a choice, and maintaining it is a result of the decisions a person has made. She outlines several simple steps to living a happier life that require a change of perspective. Building upon this, she develops a system for long term happiness and balance that would avoid any sense of burnout. This “burnout” she states affects many high-level executives and business-people whose lives are imbalanced due to too much focus on one criterion.&lt;ref name=tele2/&gt;&lt;ref name=agenda&gt;{{cite web| last =Yau| first =Thuy| title =Stop trying so hard, in life and at the office: Why less effort achieves better results| work =Women's Agenda| date =21 August 2014| url =http://www.womensagenda.com.au/talking-about/top-stories/stop-trying-so-hard-in-life-and-at-the-office-why-less-effort-achieves-better-results/201408214496}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blue2&gt;{{cite web| last =Beaumont| first =Dale| title =How to Avoid Burnout| work =Business Blueprint| url =http://www.businessblueprint.com/posts/team-building/how-to-avoid-burnout/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She comments that most people push themselves towards a goal that is not ultimately consistent with their life values. They put much more time and energy into goals and possessions that will not fundamentally increase their happiness. Trying too hard at any one thing, whether it be career or relationship oriented, will have detrimental effects that reduce overall life satisfaction. She coaches even small steps towards this goal, minor increments perhaps, are enough to begin simplification, leaving a person “relaxed and happy, instead of stressed and overwhelmed.”&lt;ref name=smh/&gt;&lt;ref name=tele2/&gt;&lt;ref name=agenda/&gt;&lt;ref name=blue2/&gt;

She has been featured in interviews for publications on lifestyle and business topics, including ''Sunrise (Ch7)'', ''the Today Show (Ch9)'', ''Cosmopolitan'', ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', “The Sunday Telegraph (UK).{{cn|date=August 2018}} Bertolucci was also interviewed by [[Weight Watchers]] where she explained that her goal-setting methods can also be used to lose weight.&lt;ref name=clax/&gt;&lt;ref name=weight&gt;{{cite web| title =Domonique Bertolucci| work =Weightwatchers| url =http://www.domoniquebertolucci.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Weight-Watchers-0601.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is an author of several books on achieving happiness and success through several techniques and psychological changes.  Bertolucci encourages her readers to see happiness as a state of being, not one of doing or having.&lt;ref name=blue/&gt;&lt;ref name=clax/&gt;

Bertolucci outlines that taking risks is often an important step in attaining happiness. While small steps can further a goal, it is important to identify what will truly bring about happiness, which can often involve some amount of personal risk. She believes there are two types of fear: a negative kind that limits people from achievement and a positive kind that gives motivation. Bertolucci has commented that it is necessary to overcome the negative effects of fear to properly channel this energy. Furthermore, she stresses the importance of reasonable goal setting, which both makes happiness more attainable while reducing the negative effects of fear and anxiety.&lt;ref name=smh/&gt;&lt;ref name=cosmp&gt;{{cite web| title =Learn to Leap| work =Cosmopolitan Magazine| url =http://www.cosmopolitan.co.za/health-fitness/mind-health/learn-to-leap-pg1/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Gaind| first =Rama| title =100 Days Happier| work =PSNews Online| url =http://www.psnews.com.au/aps/Bookreviewpsn4012.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has also written extensively on methods for improved personal relations, whether it be with friends, romantic partners, or business contacts. Attitude and genuine interest will naturally attract others' attention and increase rapport. She believes there are several varied friend types that a person should have to achieve a well-rounded world view and thus richer happiness. She has said "you need different types of friends in the same way that you need food from different food groups. Different types of friends serve different purposes and nourish and enrich our lives in different ways."&lt;ref name=tele&gt;{{cite web| last =Freedman| first =Mia| title =Good friends are like food groups.

'''Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts''', formerly '''Jamaica School of Art and Crafts''', is an important arts school in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. In 1940, [[Edna Manley]] pioneered evening art classes at the [[Institute of Jamaica]]'s Junior Centre but it was not until 1950 that the first formal arts school opened at the DaCosta Institute at 1 Central Avenue, Kingston Gardens.&lt;ref name="EMC"&gt;[http://emc.edu.jm/history-art.htm Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of leading Jamaican artists collaborated with Manley to open the first art school in Jamaica, including [[Albert Huie]] who became one of the tutors.&lt;ref name=answers&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/albert-huie-1 Albert Huie] [[Art Encyclopedia]], accessed by Answers.com&lt;/ref&gt; 64 paying students enrolled in the first year and due to unexpected interest expanded the school at 11 North Street.&lt;ref name="EMC"/&gt;
[[File:Cage Gallery .jpg|alt=Cage Gallery at EMCVPA|thumb|Cage Gallery at Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts]]
[[Barrington Watson]] established a four-year Diploma curriculum to the teaching of Art when the country gained independence in 1962. By 1964-65 the college had 86 full-time and 84 part-time students.&lt;ref name="EMC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emc.edu.jm/about.htm |title=About EMC |publisher=EMC |location=[[Kingston, Jamaica]] |accessdate=2009-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404041359/http://emc.edu.jm/about.htm |archivedate=2009-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being renamed in 1967 to the '''Jamaica School of Art''', in 1976 the school was incorporated into the '''Cultural Training Centre''' and moved to its new facilities at 1 Arthur Wint Drive, expanding its scope to include Art, Music, Dance, and Drama governed by the Institute of Jamaica under the Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref name="EMC"/&gt; 

In 1987 Edna Manley died and it was later officially designated a college in 1995, renamed as the Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts.&lt;ref name="EMC"/&gt;

In September 2004 the School of Visual Arts launched its degree program and today offers Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) and a Bachelor of Art Education (BAE) degrees and a BA degree course offered jointly with the [[University of the West Indies]].&lt;ref name="EMC"/&gt; There is also a Continuing Education division that offers part-time courses.

The '''Electronic Information Exchange System''' ('''EIES''', pronounced ''[[eye]]s'') was an early [[online conferencing]] [[bulletin board system]] that allowed [[Real-time computing|real-time]] and [[asynchronous communication]]. The system was used to deliver courses, conduct conferencing sessions, and facilitate research. Funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] and developed from 1974-1978 at the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] (NJIT) by [[Murray Turoff]] based on his earlier EMISARI done at the now-defunct [[Office of Emergency Preparedness]], EIES was intended to facilitate group communications that would allow groups to make decisions based on their [[collective intelligence]] rather than the [[lowest common denominator]]. Initially conceived as an experiment in [[computer mediated communication]], EIES remained in use for decades because its users "just wouldn't let go" of it, eventually adapting it for legislative, medical and even spiritual uses.

==Technology==
In the mid-1980s, a new version called ''EIES-2'' was developed to research the implementation of group communications in distributed environments, versus the centralized [[time-sharing]] environment used for the first version. EIES-2 had an [[object database]] architecture using over 2 dozen classes and implementing a notion of ''activities'', which was a standardized interface for implementing nonstandard functions such as polls or list-gathering. The activities concept was similar to what would be done in today's [[message board]] applications using [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]]. The standard message-based functions were also implemented as activities. EIES-2 ran on [[Unix]] and was written in the programming languages [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Smalltalk]]. EIES-2 used the [[X.400]] database standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.njit.edu/~turoff/Administrative/ccc.htm|title=An Overview of research activities in Computer Mediated Communications from 1976 to 1991 conducted by the Computerized Conferencing and Communications Center at NJIT by Murray Turoff and Starr Roxanne Hiltz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts were available to the public for a monthly fee of USD $75 plus connect-time charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_1984_Point/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_1984_Point_djvu.txt|title=WESC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
In his book [[The Virtual Community]], [[Howard Rheingold]] called EIES "the lively great-great-grandmother of all virtual communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.well.com/user/hlr/vcbook/vcbook4.html|title=The Virtual Community}}&lt;/ref&gt; EIES was one of the earliest instances of [[groupware]], if not the earliest, and some users contend it is where the term was coined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/GroupWare|title=GroupWare}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of the [[Whole Earth Software Catalog]] set up a private conference on EIES where they could collaborate on software reviews from around the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SNFpgX_WigC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131|title=From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with serious research, there were diversions like the "EIES Soap Opera", which was a series of stories written collaboratively by the service's users. The first soap opera was initiated in 1980 by [[Martin Nisenholtz]].&lt;ref name="ChangeLife"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/deli/computer_networking.php|title=Computer Networking Can Change Your Life|quote=My worklife, homelife and communications life melded together.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working groups from different corporations used EIES to collaborate, some working exclusively from home. EIES gave an early glimpse of the challenges of [[work–life balance]]&lt;ref name="ChangeLife" /&gt; and pointed the way toward [[hypertext]] and [[gamification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.njit.edu/~turoff/Administrative/ccc.htm|title=An Overview of research activities in Computer Mediated Communications from 1976 to 1991 conducted by the Computerized Conferencing and Communications Center at NJIT by Murray Turoff and Starr Roxanne Hiltz|quote=Gaming takes on a new dimension when it is possible for players in the game to participate asynchronously and it also becomes possible to replicate realistic communication constraints. We have explored and documented the benefits of this type of gaming in the management educational environment. Further work will be oriented, not only towards education, but also towards the possibility of gaming as a decision analysis tool.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable users included [[Alvin Toffler]], Peter &amp; Trudy Johnson-Lenz, [[Barry Wellman]], and Whole Earth editor-in-chief [[Stewart Brand]], who was influenced by EIES to develop [[The WELL]]. At its peak EIES had more than 2000 subscribers from various government agencies, large corporations and educational institutions. The [[Western Behavioral Sciences Institute]] ran a private conference called the ''School of Management and Strategic Studies'', of which [[Harlan Cleveland]] was a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_1984_Point/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_1984_Point_djvu.txt|title=WESC}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[legacy system]] lacking support for [[multimedia]] or [[Email attachment|file attachments]], EIES was shut down in 2000, despite NJIT's inability to locate a replacement with equivalent performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eies.njit.edu/vc.phaseout.html |title=EIES/VC Phaseout |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020802212954/http://eies.njit.edu/vc.phaseout.html |archivedate=August 2, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its shutdown, EIES-2 held 6 GB of stored data, and could serve 1,000 concurrent users with an average response time of under 15 seconds.

Ellis Page, 81, Developer of Computerized Grading, obit in the New York ''Times'', [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E4D61539F930A15756C0A9639C8B63]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marquis"&gt;[http://www.marquiswhoswho.com/ A.N.Marquis, Who’s Who in America]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Advance"&gt;"Ellis Page, Computer Grading Developer, Dies". UConn ''Advance'', July 18, 2005 [http://advance.uconn.edu/2005/050718/05071805.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; is widely acknowledged as the father of [[automated essay scoring]], a multi-disciplinary field exploring computer evaluation and scoring of student writing, particularly essays. Page’s development of and pioneering work with Project Essay Grade software in the mid-1960s set the stage for the practical application of computer essay scoring technology following the [[microcomputer revolution]] of the 1990s.

Born in San Diego, CA, Page, a [[United States Marine Corps]] veteran, graduated from [[Pomona College]] (Claremont, CA) and taught high school [[English grammar|English]] while pursuing his M.A. degree in English at [[San Diego State University]] (1955). He received his Ed.D. degree in [[educational psychology]] from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1958.

Page served as professor of education and psychology for several academic institutions before joining the [[University of Connecticut]] (Storrs) in 1962 as Professor of Educational Psychology and Director, Bureau of Educational Research. It was during his tenure there (in late 1964)&lt;ref name="Page"&gt;Page, E. B. (1967). ''Statistical and linguistic strategies in the computer grading of essays''. Coling 1967: Conférence Internationale sur le Traitement Automatique des Langues, Grenoble, France, August 1967&lt;/ref&gt; that Page began the development of PEG software, inspired by the convergence of [[computational linguistics]], [[artificial intelligence]] technology, and his own experience as a high school English teacher.

Page’s research earned him a number of academic appointments including Visiting Scientist at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (1967–68) and Visiting Professor of Experimental Design at [[Harvard University]] (1968–69). Fluent in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], Page also lectured extensively on issues and trends in educational psychology in Spain and South America.

Page published more than 250 research articles, technical reports and papers. He was President of the [[American Psychological Association]]’s Division of Educational Psychology (1976–77) and a founding editor of the division’s journal, ''[[Educational Psychologist (academic journal)|Educational Psychologist]]''. Page also served as President of the [[American Educational Research Association]] (1979–80) and contributed to the editorial review boards of several other publications, including the ''[[Journal of Educational Measurement]]'' of the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME).

In 1979, Page joined the faculty of [[Duke University]] as Professor of Educational Psychology and Research and remained there until 2002. During his tenure, Page renewed his development and research in automated scoring and, in 1993, formed Tru-Judge, Inc., anticipating the potential for commercial applications of the software. In 2002, and in declining health, Page sold the intellectual property assets of Tru-Judge to [[Measurement Incorporated]], an educational assessment company specializing in the development and scoring of large-scale assessments.

'''For-profit higher education in the United States''' (known as '''for-profit college''' or '''proprietary education''' in some instances) refers to [[higher education]] [[educational institution]]s operated by private, [[Profit (economics)|profit]]-seeking [[business]]es. 

Historically, most colleges and universities in the US have been [[not-for-profit|non-profit]], but for-profit institutions rapidly grew in number and size from 1972 to 2009, until their current enrollment decline. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/12/20/national-enrollments-decline-sixth-straight-year-slower-rate&lt;/ref&gt;

For-profit colleges include [[Cooking school|culinary arts schools]] and schools related to business, technology, and health care. 

Although supporters of for-profit higher education have argued that the [[profit motive]] encourages efficiency, the for-profit educational industry has received severe negative criticism because of its sales techniques, high costs, and poor student outcomes. In some cases operators of for-profit colleges have faced criminal charges or other legal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/07/02/college-default-rates-higher-than-grad-rates/2480295/|title=College default rates higher than grad rates|author=Mary Beth Marklein, Jodi Upton and Sandhya Kambhampati, USA TODAY|date=2 July 2013|work=USA TODAY|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digilib.gmu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digilib.gmu.edu/jspui/bitstream/1920/6273/1/Perini_thesis_2011.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Phoenix Still in Ashes : For-Profit Open Admissions and the Public Good |publisher=Digilib.gmu.edu |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.duke.edu/acfp2012/2012/08/26/doonesbury-talks-for-profit-colleges/|title=Doonesbury Talks For-Profit Colleges - ACFP 2012|publisher=Sites.duke.edu|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tressie-mcmillan-cottom/for-profit-colleges-kaplan-university_b_1205464.html|title=Insider's View of For-Profit Colleges, Race, Class and Education Justice|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=14 June 2015|date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hs.boisestate.edu/nursing/files/2012/01/For-profit-degrees.pdf |format=PDF |title=Under Fire : Nursing Degrees from For-Profit Institutions |publisher=Hs.boisestate.edu |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 to 2017, under the Obama administration, for-profit colleges received greater scrutiny and negative attention from the US government. State Attorneys General, the media, and scholars also investigated these schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Armour|first1=Stephanie|last2=Zibel|first2=Alan|title=For-Profit College Probe Expands|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303819704579318872286744010|accessdate=15 January 2015|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/04/how-higher-ed-contributes-to-inequality/360407/|title=How Higher Ed Contributes to Inequality|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014, The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] has reported that veterans using the [[GI Bill]] for education submitted more complaints about for-profit colleges, particularly [[University of Phoenix]], [[ITT Technical Institute]], [[Devry University]], and [[Colorado Technical University]], than their public or private non-profit counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/docs/Overview_GI%20Bill_Feedback%20System_CY14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, research by [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] economist Nicholas Turner and [[George Washington University]] economist Stephanie Riegg Cellini found that students who attended for-profit colleges would have been better off not going to college at all, or attending a [[community college]] (which are non-profit); put differently, the for-profit colleges left students worse off than they were when they started. The [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] paper was based on an analysis of 567,000 students who attended for-profit colleges from 2006 to 2008. More than 80% carried [[student loan debt]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/31/a-popular-college-investment-promised-students-a-career-but-didnt-pay-off/|publisher=washingtonpost.com|title=A popular college investment promised students a career, but didn&amp;#8217;t pay off - The Washington Post|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the advocacy group the [[Debt Collective]] has created its own, unofficial "Defense to Repayment App" that allows former students of schools accused of fraud to pursue debt cancellation.&lt;ref name="herokuapp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://debt-is.herokuapp.com/defense-to-repayment|publisher=debt-is.herokuapp.com|title=The Debt Collective|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The applications generated through the Debt Collective's online form were cited by the Department of Education in a Federal Register notice, which said that "a need for a clearer process for potential claimants" arose due to the submission of over 1000 defense to repayment claims by "a building debt activism movement".&lt;ref name="ed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation#closed-school|publisher=studentaid.ed.gov|title=Forgiveness, Cancellation, and Discharge &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2017, the [[Donald Trump administration]] and Secretary of Education [[Betsy DeVos]] have accused the government of regulatory overreach and have loosened regulations.&lt;ref name="consumerist.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://consumerist.com/2017/08/17/education-secretary-betsy-devos-will-allow-for-profit-schools-to-continue-offering-programs-that-dont-meet-standards/|title=Education Secretary Betsy DeVos Will Allow For-Profit Schools To Continue Offering Programs That Don’t Meet Standards|date=August 17, 2017|website=Consumerist.com|access-date=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] reported that the 12-year [[student loan default]] rate for for-profit colleges was 52 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-for-profit-college-loan-default0-20171005-story.html|title=More than half of students at for-profit colleges defaulted on loans, study finds|first=Maria|last=Danilova|website=ChicagoTribune.com|access-date=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 12-year student loan default rate for [[African Americans]] going to for-profit colleges was reported to be 65.7 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-11/black-americans-twice-as-likely-as-whites-to-default-on-student-debt|title=Black Americans Twice as Likely as Whites to Default on Student Debt|date=October 11, 2017|publisher=|access-date=January 1, 2018|via=www.Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and political lobbying==
Politics and lobbying play a significant part in the history of US for-profit school growth.&lt;ref name="republicreport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.republicreport.org/2016/friends-in-high-places-who-endorses-americas-troubled-for-profit-colleges/|publisher=republicreport.org|title=Friends In High Places: Who Endorses America’s Troubled For-Profit Colleges? &amp;#8211; Republic Report|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diploma Mills: How For-Profit Colleges Stiffed Students, Taxpayers, and the American Dream|author=Angulo, A.J.|date=2016|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=9781421420073|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8qnCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The for-profit education industry has spent more than $40&amp;nbsp;million on lobbying since 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/30/for-profit-colleges-lobbying_n_1842507.html|title=For-Profit Colleges Spending Millions On Lobbying, Nearly $40 Million Since 2007|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=14 June 2015|date=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $36&amp;nbsp;million since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/lobbying.php?cycle=2014&amp;ind=H5300 |title=For-profit Education: Lobbying, 2014 |publisher=OpenSecrets.org |date= |accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For-profit education lobbying grew from $83,000 in 1990 to approximately $4.5&amp;nbsp;million in its peak year of 2012.&lt;ref name="opensecrets"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/totals.php?cycle=2016&amp;ind=H5300|publisher=opensecrets.org|title=For-profit Education: Long-Term Contribution Trends &amp;#124; OpenSecrets|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant industry lobby is Career Education Colleges and Universities (CECU), previously known as The [[Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities]] (ASPCU).

==Recruiting, advertising, and lead generators==

==History of for-profit higher education==

===Origins===

For-profit colleges in the US have their origins in the Colonial Era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B0UGX-10hrcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Higher+ed.+inc.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Gn-6VPv0I62asQSo3oHgDg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Higher%20ed.%20inc.&amp;f=false|title=Higher Ed, Inc.|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jhu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/content/diploma-mills|publisher=jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu|title=Diploma Mills|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1940s to 2008===

In the 1940s, "fly-by-night commercial vocational 'schools' often sprang up to collect veterans' tuition grants" due to the newly created [[GI Bill]]'s then-lax requirements and limited oversight to prevent such abuses.&lt;ref name="prospect"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prospect.org/article/delivering-young-families-resonance-gi-bill|publisher=prospect.org|title=Delivering for Young Families: The Resonance of the GI Bill|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For-profit colleges grew significantly from 1972 to 1976, after the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]], part of [[President Lyndon Johnson]]'s "[[Great Society]]" of progressive reforms, was amended so that for-profit colleges could receive US government funds, to include [[Pell Grants]] and federal student loans.&lt;ref name="digilib.gmu.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scholarship.law.duke.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3355&amp;context=dlj |format=PDF |title=SUBPRIME EDUCATION: FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES AND THE PROBLEM WITH TITLE IV FEDERAL STUDENT AID |publisher=Scholarship.law.duke.edu |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1974 to 1986, for-profit colleges share of Pell Grants rose from 7 percent to 21 percent, even though for-profit colleges only enrolled 5 percent of all higher education students.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

In the late 1980s, Secretary of Education [[William Bennett]] hired an outside firm, Pelavin and Associates, to investigate the problems with for-profit higher education. The investigators found widespread abuses across the industry.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

From 1989 to the mid-1990s, Stephen Blair, a former Department of Education official, led for-profit college industry's aggressive lobbying campaign in Washington, DC. Blair gathered funds to combat the Pelavin report and to maintain for-profit education's position. Blair also recruited politicians [[Bob Beckel]], Patty Sullivan, and [[Haley Barbour]] to sell their cause to Democrats and Republicans.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

1992, the Higher Education Act was amended to include the 85–15 rule, which limited federal funding to 85 percent of a school's funding.
Supporters of the 85–15 rule argued that the measure was necessary to stem fraudulent and abusive practices at for-profit colleges,
and that it might restore some market incentive to education.&lt;ref name="congressionalresearch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://congressionalresearch.com/RL32182/document.php?study=Institutional+Eligibility+and+the+Higher+Education+Act+Legislative+History+of+the+90%20percent2F10+Rule+and+Its+Current+Status|publisher=congressionalresearch.com|title=Institutional Eligibility and the Higher Education Act: Legislative History of the 90/10 Rule and Its Current Status|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, former Career College Association lobbyist Patty Sullivan estimated that 35 or 40 percent of for-profit colleges engaged in fraud.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

In 1993, the 85–15 rule was shelved after complaints were made to the Department of Education.&lt;ref name="edweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1993/12/08/14aid.h13.html|publisher=edweek.org|title=Planned Higher-Ed. Rules Shelved After Complaints - Education Week|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the US House of Representatives voted to allow a one-year delay in regulations scheduled to halt federal student aid for many trade schools. Tony Calandro, vice president of government affairs for the [[Career College Association]] (CCA), said that enforcement of the 85–15 rule would have forced 30 percent of the nation's 4,000 private trade schools to close.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/30/us/trade-schools-win-reprieve-on-aid-cutoff.html|publisher=nytimes.com|title=Trade Schools Win Reprieve on Aid Cutoff - NYTimes.com|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For-profit college enrollment grew again between 1998 and 2009, after the 1998 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act resulted in more deregulation. Secretary of Education [[Richard W.

The for-profit college industry also grew in the wake of state budget cuts, stagnation, and austerity in higher education funding that grew more visible in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2014/04/suzanne-mettler-sees-higher-ed-caste-system|title=Suzanne Mettler sees higher ed 'caste system' |work=Cornell Chronicle|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of deregulation and the growth of for-profit colleges, [[initial public offerings]] of [[Devry]], [[ITT Educational Services]], [[Apollo Education Group]], [[Corinthian Colleges]], and [[Career Education Corporation]] occurred between 1991 and 1998. For-profit colleges had become "the darlings of Wall Street."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

According to the US Department of Education, the number of for-profit colleges rose from approximately 200 in 1986 to nearly 1000 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVM3tUhQeqUC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=for-profot+colleges+and+universities&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NCW7VJe6G5KPsQTQ4IHoDg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=for-profot%20colleges%20and%20universities&amp;f=false|title=For-Profit Colleges and Universities|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 to 2009, for-profit colleges gained significant ground over public colleges, growing to 11.8 percent of all undergraduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/08/26/enroll|title=3 Million and Counting|work=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, Senator [[Sam Nunn]] led for more scrutiny of for-profit colleges. The General Accounting Office also found that 135 for-profit colleges contributed to 54% of all student loan defaults.

In 2005, Department of Education Inspector General John B. Higgins reported that 74% of all institutional fraud investigations were for-profit colleges.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

The ''Los Angeles Times'' briefly described the role of Wall Street money in the growth of for-profit colleges.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/15/business/fi-corinthian15|publisher=articles.latimes.com|title=Operating Career College Lucrative Vocation for CEO - latimes|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased capitalization of for-profit colleges occurred after banks such as [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Wells Fargo]] and investment firms and hedge funds such as [[Blum Capital Partners]] and [[Warburg Pincus]] became large institutional investors in this industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/14/goldman-sachs-for-profit-college_n_997409.html|title=With Goldman's Foray Into Higher Education, A Predatory Pursuit Of Students And Revenues|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=14 June 2015|date=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/davidhalperin/who-owns-the-awful-corint_b_4101323.html|title=Who Owns The Awful Corinthian Colleges?

According to the 2012 Harkin Report and the NY Times, students at for-profit colleges made up "13 percent of the nation's college enrollment, but account for about 47 percent of the defaults on loans.

On August 10, 2018, US Education Secretary Betsy Devos scrapped a rule issued by the US Department of Education in 2010 which would have forced for-profit colleges to prove that the students they enroll are able to attain "gainful employment."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/08/10/trumps-education-department-moves-to-rescind-rule-aimed-at-for-profit-schools/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=july2019&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/10/us/politics/betsy-devos-for-profit-colleges.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/10/politics/devos-obama-for-profit-college-rule/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The gainful employment policy will expire on July 1, 2019.&lt;ref name=july2019 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.10news.com/newsy/betsy-devos-wants-to-end-rules-meant-to-curb-abuse-by-some-colleges&lt;/ref&gt; In the 30-day period before its expiration, however, the Department of Education will gather public input.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/devos-proposes-rollback-of-for-profit-college-rule&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of for-profit education==

===Sources of capital and cash flow===
The main sources of initial capital for public for-profit colleges are institutional investors: international banks, hedge funds, institutional retirement funds, and state retirement funds.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/07/11/goldman-sachs-kkr-flunk-in-college-investment/|title=Goldman Sachs, KKR flunk in college investment|work=New York Post|accessdate=14 June 2015|first=Josh|last=Kosman|date=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E9KJWnyDk1sC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=warburg+pincus+acquires+bridgepoint+education&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=up1k-FrajK&amp;sig=XH6RJm6-Zn644BClpMJiLEQ1kkQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QxO5VLrlMIXjsASL3YDYDQ&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=warburg%20pincus%20acquires%20bridgepoint%20education&amp;f=false|title=Corporations Are Not People|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wells Fargo]] was a major funder of [[Corinthian Colleges]]&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/davidhalperin/who-owns-the-awful-corint_b_4101323.html|publisher=huffingtonpost.com|title=Who Owns The Awful Corinthian Colleges?

The main source of cash flow consists of US Department of Education [[Higher Education Act of 1965|Higher Education Act]] [[Title IV]] funds. Title IV funds include Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL), direct loans, Federal Perkins Loans, Federal [[Pell Grants]], Academic Competitiveness Grants (ACG), National SMART Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), and Federal Work-Study (FWS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://federalstudentaid.ed.gov/site/front2back/programs/programs/fb_03_01_0030.htm|title=What are Title IV Programs?|publisher=Federalstudentaid.ed.gov|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, Congress began requiring that for-profit schools receive at least 10% of their revenues from non-federal student aid sources, which include the GI Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bair|first1=Sheila|authorlink1=Sheila Bair|title=For-Profit Schools Are a Bad Deal for Both Investors and Taxpayers |journal=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=January 1, 2015|volume=171|issue=1|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009–2010 academic year, for-profit higher education corporations received $32&amp;nbsp;billion in [[Title IV]] funding—more than 20% of all federal aid.&lt;ref name="scholarship.law.duke.edu"/&gt; For-profit colleges get approximately 70% of their funds from Title IV programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projectonstudentdebt.org/files/pub/90-10_Q_and_A_Oct_2013_Update.pdf |title=Search |publisher=Projectonstudentdebt.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some colleges get more than 80% of their funds from Title IV.&lt;ref name="help.senate.gov"/&gt;

==Benefits==
Historically, for-profit education has offered open admissions to non-traditional students, convenience of schedule and location, instructors with workplace knowledge, and real world vocational training rather than traditional training. Critics of [[Wall Street]]-backed for-profit educators, however, have questioned these perceived benefits.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacacnet.org/issues-action/LegislativeNews/Pages/For-Profit-Colleges.aspx|title=The Low-Down on For-Profit Colleges|publisher=Nacacnet.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/01/for-profit-college-student-debt|title=Screw U: How For-Profit Colleges Rip You Off|work=Mother Jones|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study by the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reported that students who attend for-profit education institutions are more likely to be unemployed, earn less, have higher debt levels, and are more likely to default on their student loans than similar students at non-profit educational institutions.&lt;ref name=Goldin&gt;David J. Deming, Claudia Goldin, and Lawrence F. Katz, "[http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/forprofitpaper.pdf The For-Profit Postsecondary School Sector: Nimble Critters or Agile Predators?]" National Bureau of Economic Research 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Although for-profits typically serve students who are poorer or more likely to be minorities, these differences do not explain the differences in employment, income, debt levels, and student loan defaults.&lt;ref name=Goldin/&gt; The [[Government Accountability Office]] has also found that graduates of for-profits are less likely to pass licensing exams, and that poor student performance cannot be explained by different student demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kelly Field|title= Demographics Do Not Explain For-Profit Colleges' Shortcomings on Student-Success Measures, GAO Says|journal=Chronicle of Higher Education|date=December 7, 2011|url=http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/130040/|publisher=Chronicle.com|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to community colleges, some for-profits may have higher completion rates for certificates and associate degree programs,&lt;ref name="mediamatters.org"/&gt; but higher drop out rates for four-year bachelor's degrees.&lt;ref name=Goldin/&gt; However, studies suggest that one- and two-year programs often may not provide much economic benefit to students because the boost to wages is offset by increased debt. By contrast, four-year programs provide a large economic benefit.&lt;ref name=Simkovic&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1941070 Risk-Based Student Loans] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

:"This gives for-profit colleges an incentive to see service members as nothing more than dollar signs in uniform, and to use aggressive marketing to draw them in and take out private loans...One of the most egregious reports of questionable marketing involved a college recruiter who visited a Marine barracks at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]], North Carolina. As the PBS program ''Frontline'' reported, the recruiter signed up Marines with serious brain injuries. The fact that some of them couldn’t remember what courses they were taking was immaterial, as long as they signed on the dotted line."

Opponents say that the fundamental purpose of an educational institution should be to educate, not to turn a profit. In 2000, Bob Chase, president of the [[National Education Association]], stated that "educating children is very different from producing a product".&lt;ref name="BusinessWeek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_06/b3667001.htm|title=For-Profit Schools|accessdate=26 September 2008|author=William C Symonds|date=2000-02-07|work=BusinessWeek|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain postsecondary education programs at institutions of higher education are eligible for participation in the federal student aid programs, known as [[Title IV]] of the US [[Higher Education Act of 1965|Higher Education Act]] (HEA). These programs, which are offered by public and private not-for-profit institutions, postsecondary vocational institutions, and by for-profit proprietary institutions, should prepare students for [[gainful employment]]. For decades, the [[U.S. Department of Education]] (ED) had not established regulations that explicitly outlined what it means for a program to be properly preparing students for gainful employment. As pressing concerns about the quality of programs at for- profit institutions began to arise, the concerns about the level of student loan debt assumed by students did as well. Such issues led to new initiatives and rules to be set in place outlining the parameters for what should be mandated to help ensure gainful employment.

The 2011 Senate HELP committee released data showing one in every four students who enroll at a for-profit school default on their loans within three years of leaving, with for-profit students accounting for almost half of all loan defaults.&lt;ref name="Sessions, Jennifer 2011"&gt;Sessions, Jennifer. (February 8, 2011). "Harkin Calls on For-Profit Colleges to End Deceptive Recruiting Practices". Senate HELP Committee. Accessed 4 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Most for-profit colleges charge enrollees much higher tuition rates than analogous programs at community colleges and state public universities despite credits being likely not eligible to be transferred to other institutions.&lt;ref name="Sessions, Jennifer 2011"/&gt; In fact, 96% of students attending for-profit college apply for federal student loans compared to 13% at community colleges. During the 2009–2010 school years, for-profit colleges received almost $32&amp;nbsp;billion in grants and loans provided to students under federal student aid programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gao.gov/products/GAO-12-150 |title=U.S. GAO - For-Profit Schools: Experiences of Undercover Students Enrolled in Online Classes at Selected Colleges |publisher=Gao.gov |date= |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This staggering number means nearly all students at for-profit institutions acquire student loan debt, even when they do not earn the end product of a degree or accumulate increased earning power through their studies (Sessions, 2011). These statistics represent a large portion of for- profits, uncovering the serious need for greater accountability in ensuring students are making sound investments in such institutions.

According to the [[Government Accountability Office]], enrollment in such institutions has increased faster than traditional higher-education institutions in recent years. With the student and federal interest in such programs growing, so has the concern with their productivity. Regrettably, this is not a simple matter to address, as the issue is multidimensional. For-profit institutions have become an increasingly visible portion of the U.S. higher education sector. For-profits also acquire the largest percentage of their overall revenue from federal student aid programs, highlighting tax dollars are potentially not being used efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Deming, David. (February, 2012). "The For-Profit Postsecondary School Sector:
Nimble Critters or Agile Predators?" Center for Analysis Postsecondary education and employment.&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal regulatory actions by the ED have attempted to address these issues in the Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. These efforts were very contentious. For-profit institutions argue their sector is unfairly targeted and believe the Department of Education over stepped its boundaries in 2010 by implementing regulations specifying requirements for [[Gainful Employment]]. These rules outlined in a report by Congressional Research Service (CRS), aimed to hold for-profits accountable by creating standards which must be upheld and followed, which will in turn attempt create more opportunity for gainful employment amongst enrollees.&lt;ref name="SmoleDavid"&gt;Smole, David. (January 23, 2013). "Department of Education Final Rules for Postsecondary Education Programs That Prepare Students for Gainful Employment in a Recognized Occupation". Accessed February 4, 2013. Congressional Research Service Database.&lt;/ref&gt; Through these regulations the ED believed that institutions will reinforce their educational programs to meet these higher standards, and relatively few programs will fail. Programs that offer a rewarding education at a reasonable price will succeed, and institutions will continue to innovate to assist students and taxpayers.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Registrar. 76 FR 34385. "Program Integrity: Gainful Employment-Debt Measures". Accessed 2 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulations mandated by the ED were to help regulate the for-profit sector and to combat the issue of gainful employment. However, the [[Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities]], which endorses for –profits, challenged these regulations in court. On June 30, 2012 the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia decided to vacate most aspects of the regulations.&lt;ref name="SmoleDavid" /&gt; The court sustained that the ED had the authority to regulate gainful employment, yet it cited the ED had not provided rationale metrics or measures in the debt measures. At present, only the disclosure requirements of providing prospective students with placements rates, on time graduation rates and other similar information remain.&lt;ref&gt;Smole, David. (January 23, 2013). "Department of Education Final Rules for Postsecondary Education Programs That Prepare Students for Gainful Employment in a Recognized Occupation". Accessed February 4, 2013. Congressional Research Service Database&lt;/ref&gt; On March 19, 2013 the judge ruled again in response to the ED's motion to reinstate the reporting requirements in order that it could implement the disclosure requirements of Gainful Employment. The judged denied the motion of the ED on the basis that the reporting requirements would violate the federal ban on the student unit record system. It is strongly debatable that the court's ruling negates the small amount of transparency and accountability mandated by the disclosure requirements, leaving the policy issue of for-profits being accountable for [[Gainful Employment]] unattended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newamerica.net/taxonomy/term/1764 |title=Welcome to nginx! |publisher=Newamerica.net |date= |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics have called for-profit education "subprime education", in an analogy with the [[subprime mortgage]]s bubble at the heart of the [[Great Recession]] – finding uninformed borrowers and loading them with debt they cannot afford, then securitizing and passing the loan onto third-party investors. Activist short seller [[Steve Eisman]] (famous for being a character in [[Michael Lewis]]'s ''[[The Big Short]]'') has described the accreditation situation regarding for-profits like ITT as follows: "The scandal here is exactly akin to the rating agency role in subprime securitizations."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/37896158/Greenberg_For_Profit_Schools_Subprime_Redux Greenberg: For-Profit Schools ...

A two-year congressional investigation report—from a committee chaired by Senator [[Tom Harkin]], D-Iowa—examined enrollment numbers in selected for-profit higher education institutions. The committee found that $32&amp;nbsp;billion in federal funds were spent in 2009–2010 on for-profit colleges. The majority of students enrolled in the institutions left without a degree and carried post-schooling debt. Regarding the dropout rates, the report said 54% of students in bachelor's degree programs dropped out before degree completion and 63% of students in associate degree programs dropped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/for_profit_report/Contents.pdf|title=''For Profit Higher Education: The Failure to Safeguard the Federal Investment and Ensure Student Success''|website=Senate.gov|access-date=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2005 congressional discussions concerning reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and in the [[U.S. Secretary of Education]]'s [http://www.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/hiedfuture/index.html ''Commission on the Future of Higher Education''], there were proposals, ultimately unsuccessful, to mandate that regional accrediting agencies bar the schools they accredit from basing decisions on whether or not to accept credits for transfer ''solely'' on the accreditation of the "sending" school.&lt;ref name=demand/&gt;&lt;ref name=tussle/&gt; They could still reject the credits, but they would have to have additional reasons.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The American Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC), a nonprofit accreditor for-profit schools, supported the proposed rule.&lt;ref name=demand/&gt;&lt;ref name=tussle/&gt;&lt;ref name=agenda/&gt; The ACCSC claims regionally accredited schools will not accept nationally accredited schools credits for purely arbitrary, prejudicial and/or anti-competitive reasons.&lt;ref name=agenda/&gt; It further stated that, since the Department of Education recognizes both national and regional accreditation, there is no reason for regionals to differentiate between the two and to do so amounts to an unwarranted denial of access.&lt;ref name=demand/&gt;&lt;ref name=tussle/&gt;&lt;ref name="agenda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accsc.org/Student-Corner/Transfer-of-Credit.aspx|publisher=accsc.org|title=Transfer of Credit |accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the [[American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers]] (AACRAO) was that national accrediting standards were not as rigorous and, though they might be well-suited for vocational and career education, were ill-suited for academic institutions.&lt;ref name="aacrao"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aacrao.org/federal_relations/transfer/FEDERALIZING_TRANSFER_OF_ACADEMIC_CREDIT.pdf |title=''Federalized Transfer of Academic Credit, Proposed Mandate Would Hurt Students'' AACRAO website |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226201419/http://www.aacrao.org/federal_relations/transfer/FEDERALIZING_TRANSFER_OF_ACADEMIC_CREDIT.pdf |archivedate=26 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; AACRAO alleged that this proposed rule was unnecessary and unjustified, could threaten the autonomy and potentially lower the standards of regionally accredited schools, and drive up their costs.&lt;ref name=aacrao/&gt; Furthermore, it stated the proposed rule was an attempt by the for-profits' "well-funded lobbyists" to obscure the difference between for-profits' "lax academic criteria for accreditation" and non-profits' higher standards.&lt;ref name=aacrao/&gt;

Some for-profit schools have received regional accreditation, including [[American InterContinental University]], [[American Public University System]], [[Capella University]], [[DeVry University]], [[Kaplan University]], [[National American University]], [[Post University]], [[San Joaquin Valley College]], [[Strayer University]], [[University of Phoenix]], [[Universal Technical Institute]], and [[Walden University]].

Accrediting agencies have gained some scrutiny and criticism for conflicts of interest. Because these agencies receive their funding from the institutions themselves, they may have a vested interest in not aggressively supervising these for-profit colleges.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/19/for-profit-college-accreditation_n_3937079.html|title=How For-Profit Colleges Stay In Business Despite Terrible Track Record|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=14 June 2015|date=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chris Kirkham and Kevin Short:
"Two accrediting bodies...collectively monitor nearly 60 percent of all American for-profit colleges. They preside over almost half of those schools with the nation's worst student loan default rates....Ten of the 15 board members supervising the ACICS are drawn from the industry, including executives from Corinthian, [[Education Corporation of America]] and [[ITT Technical Institute]].

==Government scrutiny, criminal and civil investigations==

According to A.J. Angulo, for-profit higher education in the US has been the subject of government scrutiny from the mid-1980s to the 2010s.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

For-profits topped the Department of Education's list for the 2005–2007 cohort default rates, with campuses at ATI and Kaplan reporting default rates far above 20%. Most of the for-profits' expansion has been in the states of California, Arizona, Texas and Florida, with the metro areas of Los Angeles, Phoenix, Dallas and Miami-[[West Palm Beach]] being centers of their growth.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vasquez|first=Michael|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/09/04/1809205/for-profit-schools-grow-as-do.html|title=For-profit schools grow – as do complaints – Education|work=Miami Herald|date=2011-03-15|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/05/us/05fraud.html|work=The New York Times|title=School Is Linked To Visa Fraud|first=Carmen|last=Gentile|date=March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramsey|first=Ross|url=http://www.texastribune.org/texas-education/higher-education/private-for-profit-colleges-under-the-microscope/|title=Private, For-Profit Colleges Under the Microscope – Higher Education|publisher=The Texas Tribune|date=2010-07-20|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://californiawatch.org/watchblog/whistleblower-lawsuit-against-profit-education-company-unsealed|title=Whistleblower lawsuit against for-profit education company unsealed|publisher=California Watch|date=May 10, 2010|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, in Miami, [[Everest Institute]] reports a default rate for two of its campuses to be 18% and 20%; [[Miami Dade College]], the district's community college, which serves as a primary channel for local beginning students, reports a default rate of roughly 10%; [[Florida International University]], a public university serving the Miami metropolitan area, reports approximately 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/offices/OSFAP/defaultmanagement/peps300.zip |format=ZIP |title=FY11 Official 300 Report |publisher=2.ed.gov |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, the [[Government Accountability Office]] reported on an investigation that randomly sampled student-recruiting practices of several for-profit institutions. Investigators who posed as prospective students documented deceptive recruiting practices, including misleading information about costs and potential future earnings. They also reported that some recruiters had urged them to provide false information on applications for financial aid.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel de Vise and Paul Kane, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/04/AR2010080403816.html GAO: 15 for-profit colleges used deceptive recruiting tactics], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the fifteen sampled, all were found to have engaged in deceptive practices, improperly promising unrealistically high pay for graduating students, and four engaged in outright [[fraud]], per a GAO report released at a hearing of the [[Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee]] held on August 4, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-948T|title=U.S. GAO - For-Profit Colleges: Undercover Testing Finds Colleges Encouraged Fraud and Engaged in Deceptive and Questionable Marketing Practices|publisher=Gao.gov|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of misconduct include:
* offering [[commission (remuneration)|commissions]] to admissions officers,
* employing deceptive marketing tactics by refusing to disclose total tuition cost to prospective students before signing a binding agreement,
* lying about accreditation,
* encouraging outright fraud by enticing students to take out student loans even when the applicant had $250,000 in savings,
* promising extravagant, unlikely high pay to students,
* failing to disclose graduation rate, and
* offering tuition cost equivalent to 9 months of credit hours per year, when total program length was 12 months.
The four for-profit colleges found to be engaging in fraudulent practices were:
# Westech, California: Encouraging [[undercover]] applicant with falsified $250,000 in savings to falsely increase the number of dependents in the household in order to qualify for a Pell Grant, as well as take out the maximum amount in student loans;
# [[Medvance Institute]] in [[Miami, Florida]]: Financial aid representative told an applicant not to report $250,000 in savings, comparing student loans to a car payment in that, "no one will come after you if you don't pay". In fact, a student loan default may remain in the debtor's credit history, prevent them from taking out a car loan, mortgage or rent, and may have their pay garnished up to 15%, until the student loan is paid in full.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Another admissions officer at Kaplan College in Pembroke Pines, Florida,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2010-08-05/news/fl-kaplan-for-profit-investigation-20100805_1_kaplan-college-for-profit-enrollment|title=Kaplan College suspends admissions at Pembroke Pines campus following federal investigation|work=Sun-Sentinel|date=2010-08-05|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; alluded to fraudulent behaviour stating to the applicant when inquiring about the repayment of loans, "You gotta look at it ... I owe $85,000 to the University of Florida. Will I pay it back? Probably not ... I look at life as tomorrows never promised ... Education is an investment, you’re going to get paid back ten-fold, no matter what.";
# [[Anthem Institute]] in [[Springfield Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Springfield, Pennsylvania]]: Financial aid representative editing applicant's FAFSA form by omitting $250,000 in savings;
# [[Westwood College]] in [[Dallas, Texas]]: Admissions representative telling applicant to falsely add dependents to qualify for Pell Grants, assuring the applicant that the dependents would not be verified through previous income tax returns nor Social Security numbers, and financial aid representative encouraging applicant not to report the $250,000 in savings, stating that "it was not the government's business how much money the undercover applicant had in a bank account.", when the Department of Education requires students to report such assets, along with income, to determine how much and what type of financial aid will be awarded.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
It was found that 14 out of 15 times, the tuition at a for-profit sample was more expensive than its public counterpart, and 11 out of 15 times, it was more expensive than the private counterpart. Examples of the disparity in full tuition per program include: $14,000 for a certificate at the for-profit institution, when the same diploma cost $500 at a public college; $38,000 for an Associate's at the for-profit institution, when the comparable program at the public college cost $5,000; $61,000 for a Bachelor's at the for-profit institution, compared to $36,000 for the same degree at the public college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10948t.pdf|title=GAO-10-948T For-Profit Colleges: Undercover Testing Finds Colleges Encouraged Fraud and Engaged in Deceptive and Questionable Marketing Practices|format=PDF|date=August 4, 2010|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is counter to [[International Education Corporation]] CEO [[Fardad Fateri|Fardad Fateri's]] claims of the lack of use of unorthodox recruiting practices and a for-profit's "value" in an IEC open letter to Congress,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iecglobal.com/Aug2710.asp |title=International Education Corporation : Newsroom |publisher=Iecglobal.com |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} the tuition cost of certificates and associate degrees being 28 and 6 times more than at a public college, respectively; Fateri writes, "Credit should be given to non-profit universities that have been able to convince students and their sophisticated parents to pay approximately $400,000.00 for an undergraduate degree that will seldom lead to an academically related career." However, the most expensive college in the United States, [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in [[Bronxville, New York]], had a tuition cost of $41,040 for 2009 fiscal year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/33380153/?slide=11|title=Most Expensive Colleges|work=[[CNBC]]|date=2009-10-19|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;!-- link says $54,410, not $41,040--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campusgrotto.com/most-expensive-colleges-for-2009-2010.html|title=Most Expensive Colleges for 2009–2010|publisher=CampusGrotto|date=2009-10-19|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the tuition of a four-year bachelor's degree to just above $160,000.

==Attempts to regulate and deregulate the industry==
The [[US Department of Education]] (DoED) has proposed rules, "gainful employment regulations", that would provide more transparency and accountability to institutions that offer professional and technical training. According to DoED, this regulation is an attempt to "protect borrowers and taxpayers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Obama Administration Announces Final Rules to Protect Students from Poor-Performing Career College Programs |url= http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/obama-administration-announces-final-rules-protect-students-poor-performing-care|location= |publisher= [[United States Department of Education]] |agency= |date= October 30, 2014 |accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2015 budget proposal, President Obama recommended greater regulation of for-profit education, including a closure of the loophole that exempted GI Bill money from being used in the 90-10 formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/02/03/obama-seeks-boost-higher-education-spending-and-proposes-some-loan-reforms-have|title=Obama seeks to boost higher education spending and proposes some loan reforms that have bipartisan appeal - InsideHigherEd|publisher=Insidehighered.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the US Department of Education held public hearings were held in order to determine whether the government had overstepped regulation efforts, particularly with [[gainful employment]] and [[defense to repayment]] rules.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2017-07-10/trump-administration-begins-rewriting-for-profit-regulations&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos instituted policies to loosen regulations on for-profit colleges.&lt;ref name="consumerist.com"/&gt;

In September 2017, the Trump Administration proposed to remove conflict of interest rules between VA officials and for-profit colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/business/veterans-affairs-ethics.html|title=Veterans Agency Seeks to Scrap Ethics Law on For-Profit Colleges|first=Patricia|last=Cohen|date=September 29, 2017|publisher=|access-date=January 1, 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For-profit college lobbyists promoting deregulation===
Lobbyists for the for-profit higher education industry have taken several steps to stop regulation and to fight against transparency and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/11/07/profit-groups-sue-block-gainful-employment-rules|title=For-Profit Groups Sue to Block Gainful Employment Rules |publisher=Insidehighered.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also supported at least two lawsuits to squash gainful employment regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.career.org/news-and-media/press-releases/upload/APSCU-v-Duncan-DDC-2014-11-06-Plaintiff-s-Complaint.pdf |format=PDF |title=Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities v.

==For-profit colleges transitioning to nonprofit colleges==
At least three colleges or universities have transitioned to nonprofit status: [[Keiser University]], [[Remington College]], and [[Herzing University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/for-profit-herzing-u-converts-to-nonprofit-status/91695|title=For-Profit Herzing U. Converts to Nonprofit Status – The Ticker - Blogs - The Chronicle of Higher Education|publisher=Chronicle.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists argue that these transitions are strategies to reduce state and federal regulations and to obtain more [[Title IV]] funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/davidhalperin/if-a-for-profit-college-b_b_2661788.html|title=If a For-Profit College Becomes a Non-Profit, Is That Good?

In 2014 [[Grand Canyon University]] considered a transition to nonprofit status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-13/grand-canyon-eyes-2-billion-exit-from-for-profit-college-stigma.html|title=Grand Canyon Eyes $2 Billion Exit From For-Profit College Stigma|author=Michael McDonald|date=13 November 2014|work=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, Grand Canyon's regional accreditation body, [[The Higher Learning Commission]], formally rejected the university's petition for conversion to non-profit status. The commission's board of directors stated that the school did not meet all five criteria for "such a conversion".&lt;ref name="www.hlcommission.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hlcommission.org/download/_PublicDisclosureNotices/Grand%20Canyon%20University%20PDN.pdf|title=Public Disclosure Notice|website=HLCommission.org|access-date=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ktar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ktar.com/story/946879/grand-canyon-university-denied-switch-to-nonprofit-status/|publisher=ktar.com|title=Grand Canyon University denied switch to nonprofit status|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.abc15.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/grand-canyon-university-denied-request-to-switch-to-nonprofit-status|publisher=abc15.com|title=Grand Canyon University denied request to switch to nonprofit status - ABC15 Arizona|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Kaplan University]] was sold to [[Purdue University]] and became [[Purdue University Global]] in 2018. Kaplan, however would be the servicer for the institution and the Higher Learning Commission would continue to accredit the school. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2018/Q1/purdue-announces-name-for-new-public-university-purdue-university-global-to-serve-working-adults,-online.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jconline.com/story/news/2018/09/10/regulators-purdue-campus-review-purdue-global-deal/1252718002/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[Grand Canyon University]] and [[Ashford University]] petitioned for non-profit status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/03/13/ashford-university-latest-big-profit-attempt-nonprofit-conversion|title=Ashford University is latest big for-profit to attempt nonprofit conversion|author=|date=|website=insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded in November 1959 by [[Kwame Nkrumah]] with the aim to promote the pursuit, advancement and dissemination of knowledge in all branches of the sciences and the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalacademies.org/asadi/PDFs/GAAS.pdf "The Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304112237/http://www.nationalacademies.org/asadi/PDFs/GAAS.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, The National Academies.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences began its life as the Ghana Academy of Learning,&lt;ref name=ICS&gt;[http://www.icsu.org/publicdb/frmDisplayMember?docid=20bfaaf4cdbf418eabc2837ab57a7734 "Detailed information: Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922082308/http://www.icsu.org/publicdb/frmDisplayMember?docid=20bfaaf4cdbf418eabc2837ab57a7734 |date=2015-09-22 }}, International Council for Science.&lt;/ref&gt; and was formally opened on 27 November 1959 by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], at the Great Hall of the [[University College of Ghana]], who became its first president along with Nkrumah. It was merged with the National Research Council in 1963 to become the Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1968 it was again split into (a) The Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences, which is a purely learned society, and (b) The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which undertakes research of an applied nature related to national needs.&lt;ref name=ICS /&gt;

==Mission==
The mission of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences is to encourage the creation, acquisition, dissemination and utilization of knowledge for national development through the promotion of learning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaas-gh.org/about/ "About"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525034055/http://gaas-gh.org/about/ |date=2015-05-25 }}, Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Günter Behnisch''' (June 12, 1922 – July 12, 2010) was a [[Germany|German]] [[architect]], born in [[Lockwitz]], near [[Dresden]]. During the [[Second World War]] he became one of Germany's youngest submarine commanders. Subsequently, Behnisch became one of the most prominent architects representing [[deconstructivism]]. His prominent projects included the [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Olympic Park]] in [[Munich]] and the new [[West Germany|West German]] [[Bundeshaus (Bonn)|parliament]] in [[Bonn]].

==Early life==
Behnisch was born the second of three children, in Lockwitz near Dresden.&lt;ref name="Indy Obit"&gt;David Childs, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/gnter-behnisch-the-architect-behind-munichs-groundbreaking-olympic-stadium-2045932.html ''Günter Behnisch&amp;#58; The architect behind Munich's groundbreaking Olympic Stadium''], in [[The Independent|The Independent (London)]], 7 August 2010, retrieved 1 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He attended a number of schools, due to the fact his [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]] father was arrested, sacked and redeployed to [[Chemnitz]] by the new [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] government.&lt;ref name="Indy Obit" /&gt;

In 1939, Behnisch volunteered to join the navy (''[[Kriegsmarine]]''), aged 17, which was a less onerous alternative to compulsory labour service, or army conscription.&lt;ref name="Indy Obit" /&gt; He eventually became a [[U-boat]] officer and served aboard {{GS|U-952||2}}. In October 1944, he became one of the youngest U-boat commanders,when he commissioned {{GS|U-2337||2}}.{{sfn|Busch|Röll|1999|p=29}} At the end of the [[Second World War]] he surrendered his submarine to the British and became a [[prisoner of war]] in [[Featherstone Castle]] in Northumberland.&lt;ref name="Indy Obit" /&gt;

Behnisch initially trained as a bricklayer&lt;ref name="Indy Obit" /&gt; then, in 1947 enrolled to study architecture at the [[University of Stuttgart|Technical University in Stuttgart]].&lt;ref name="Spiegel Obit"&gt;Thorsten Dörting, [http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,706359,00.html ''Obituary of the Architect Günter Behnisch''], in [[Der Spiegel|Spiegel online international]], 13 July 2010, retrieved 9 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bonn Bundestag.jpg|thumb|230px|Plenary chamber of the German Bundestag in Bonn]]

==Architectural career==
One of his most notable buildings was the new parliament in the West German capital, [[Bonn]]. Although he won the architectural design competition in 1973, the construction only began in 1987, and was completed in 1992.&lt;ref name="Spiegel Obit" /&gt;

He established his own architecture practice in [[Stuttgart]] in 1952, {{citation needed|date=January 2017}} which in 1966 became Behnisch &amp; Partner.

His son Stefan Behnisch established a separate firm, [[Behnisch Architekten]] in 1989.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9416">The '''Institute for Radium Research''' is an Austrian [[research institute]] associated with the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]], [[Vienna]].  The Institute's researchers won multiple Nobel Prizes.  Due to the gradual change of interests, "nuclear physics" was added to the institute's name  in 1956. Since 2004, it is called the ''Stefan-Meyer-Institute for subatomic physics''.&lt;ref name="SMI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oeaw.ac.at/smi/about-us/history/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504180014/http://www.oeaw.ac.at/smi/about-us/history/ |archivedate=2015-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The [[Jáchymov|Sankt Joachimsthal]] mines were located within the [[Austria-Hungary]] monarchy, and were the largest producers of uranium containing ore at the end of the 19th century. Eduard Suess sent the first samples of [[Uraninite|pitchblende]] to [[Pierre Curie|Pierre]] and [[Marie Curie]] for their research on radioactive materials. This action was taken after the advice of [[Franz Serafin Exner]].&lt;ref name="Walk"/&gt; After the discovery of [[radium]], the Austrian industrial [[Karl Kupelwieser]] donated 500,000 [[Austrian kronen]] to found an institute for research on radium in 1908. After constructing the building for the institute in 1909–1910, the institute was opened on 28 October 1910. [[Stefan Meyer (physicist)|Stefan Meyer]] became the first acting director, and [[Franz Serafin Exner]] was the director of the institute until Meyer took over in 1920. Meyer stayed in that position until the [[Anschluss]] Österreichs in 1938, the annexation of Austria by [[Nazi Germany]], forced him to retire due to his Jewish ancestors.&lt;ref name="Walk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chr. Ottner 2004"&gt;St. Sienell und Chr. Ottner: ''Das Archiv des Instituts für Radiumforschung'', Anzeiger der Österr. Akad. d. Wissenschaften Abt. II, 140, 11-53 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, he was reinstated as director and performed his duties until his retirement in 1947.&lt;ref name="Pers"&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/s000160050058|journal =Physics in Perspective|year = 2001|last1 = Reiter|first1 = Wolfgang L.|volume = 3|pages = 106|title = Stefan Meyer: Pioneer of Radioactivity|bibcode = 2001PhP.....3..106R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The starting years were dominated by the research on the new element radium. Meyer was able to organize the production of 4&amp;nbsp;[[gram]] radium, as recommended in 1901 by the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]]. The chemical plant of [[Carl Auer von Welsbach]], which was used to produce [[rare-earth element]]s, provided the necessary technical equipment and knowledge required for separation of small quantities of material from ore.&lt;ref name="Walk"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1007/PL00000541|title = Vienna: A Random Walk in Science| isbn = 978-3-7643-8932-1|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=i4uLnMZeACsC&amp;pg=PA156|year = 2001| last1 = Reiter| first1 = Wolfgang L.| journal = Physics in Perspective| volume = 3| pages = 462|bibcode = 2001PhP.....3..462R| issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This relative large amount made it possible for [[Otto Hönigschmid]] to determine the molecular mass of radium using 1.5&amp;nbsp;g of [[radium bromide]].

[[Victor Franz Hess]] was working on the absorption of [[gamma ray]]s in the [[atmosphere]]. His discovery of [[cosmic ray]]s in 1912, which was rewarded by the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1936, was a direct result of his work in the institute.&lt;ref name="Walk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://epub.oeaw.ac.at/0xc1aa500d_0x00107589.pdf|title = Über die Arbeit des Instituts für Radiumforschung|doi = 10.1007/BF01546649|journal = Naturwissenschaften|first =Fritz|last = Paneth|volume = 3|issue = 34 |year = 1915|pages = 437––443|bibcode = 1915NW......3..437P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Anzeiger Abt.

[[George de Hevesy]] and [[Friedrich Adolf Paneth]] developed at the Institute the [[radioactive tracer]]s method, for which Hevesy received the Nobel Prize in 1943.&lt;ref name="Walk"/&gt; Initially, very few women scientists worked at the Institute, including [[Berta Karlik]] and [[Marietta Blau]]; however, the percentage of women reached 30% during the time of Meyer.&lt;ref name="Walk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://othes.univie.ac.at/1746/1/2008-09-30_0107284.pdf|first = Katharina Maximiliane|last = Zelger|accessdate = 2010-03-17|title =Stefan Meyer und die Frauen}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1945 to 1974, Berta Karlik directed the Institute.&lt;ref name="SMI" /&gt; In 1955, Karlik became professor for nuclear physics at the [[University of Vienna]], so that the Institute was now both an Academy and a University Institute. Herbert Vonach succeeded her as director from 1974 to 1986.&lt;ref name="Chr. Ottner 2004"/&gt;

The institute was renamed in 1956, so that "nuclear physics" was now included in the title - corresponding to the widened research interests. In 1987, the institute was converted into an "Institute for Intermediate Energy Physics" under the direction of W. H. Breunlich.&lt;ref name="SMI" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://medienportal.univie.ac.at/uniview/veranstaltungen/detailansicht/artikel/physik-mit-strahlender-vergangenheit/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honour ==
On 28 May 2015, the Institute received the title "Historic Site" by the [[European Physical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eps.org/?page=distinction_sites&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oeaw.ac.at/smi/news/news-single-display/?tx_ttnews |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505003338/http://www.oeaw.ac.at/smi/news/news-single-display/?tx_ttnews |archivedate=2015-05-05 |df= }}[tt_news]=65&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=23&amp;cHash=bab2a18726&lt;/ref&gt;

== Successor Organisations ==
There are now two separate successor organisations:

* The Stefan Meyer Institute for subatomic Physics of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] (SMI, earlier: Institute for Intermediate Energy Physics) that investigates the [[Strong Interaction]] in cooperation with foreign research centers.
* The Institute for Isotope Research and Nuclear Physics of the [[University of Vienna]] which uses the particle accelerator VERA for [[Radiocarbon Dating]] and similar dating methods.

'''Johann Friedrich Herbart''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhɛʁbaʁt|lang}}; 4 May 1776 – 14 August 1841) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]], [[psychologist]] and founder of [[pedagogy]] as an academic discipline.

Herbart is now remembered amongst the [[post-Kantian]] philosophers mostly as making the greatest contrast to [[Georg Hegel|Hegel]]—in particular in relation to [[aesthetics]].

==Life==
Herbart was born on 4 May 1776 in [[Oldenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/johann-herbart/|title=Johann Friedrich Herbart|last=Kim|first=Alan|date=2015-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up as a fragile child because of an unfortunate accident, Herbart was taught by his mother at home until the age of 12. He continued his schooling at the ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]'' for six years, and showed interest in philosophy, logic and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] work involving the nature of knowledge obtained from experience with reality. His education then continued at [[University of Jena|Jena]], whereupon he studied philosophy and came to disagree with his teacher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] precisely because Fichte had taught him to think in a logical manner. He composed a few essays, which he had given to Fichte during his years at Jena, criticising the works of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and advocating his contention for the [[German idealism]] promoted by others like Kant at the time.

Leaving Jena after three years, he tutored the children of Herr von Steiger, who was the Governor of [[Interlaken]]. During these three years, his tutoring job sparked his interest in educational reform. While tutoring in [[Switzerland]], Herbart met and came to know [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]], the Swiss educator involved with issues of reform in the schools. Resigning from his tutoring position, Herbart went on to study [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Mathematics]] at [[University of Bremen|Bremen]] for three years, and then eventually moved on to attend [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] from 1801 to 1809. While there, he received a privat-docent for his endeavours in educational studies after receiving his doctoral degree. He gave his first philosophical lectures at [[Göttingen]] around 1805, whence he removed in 1809 to occupy the chair formerly held by Kant at [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]]. Here he also established and conducted a seminary of pedagogy till 1833, when he returned once more to Göttingen, and remained there as professor of philosophy till his death. Herbart gave his last lecture in perfectly good health and then unexpectedly died two days later from apoplexy. He is buried in [[Albanifriedhof|Albanifriedhof Cemetery]] in Göttingen.

Herbart was very much focused on his studies, and “he barely saw the world outside his study and the classrooms” making “his world the world of books and only books”.{{sfn|Wolman|1968|p=29}} Regardless of his relentless studying, he met an eighteen-year-old English girl named Mary Drake one night when playing a game of charades. He became acquainted with her and asked her for her hand in marriage. They lived a happy life with Mary supporting all of her husband’s pursuits and contributions to the fields of pedagogy and psychology.

==Philosophy==

Philosophy, according to Herbart, begins with reflection upon our empirical conceptions, and consists in the reformation and elaboration of these, its three primary divisions being determined by as many distinct forms of elaboration. [[Philosophical logic|Logic]], which stands first, has to render our conceptions and the judgments and reasonings arising from them clear and distinct. But some conceptions are such that the more distinct they are made the more contradictory their elements become; so to change and supplement these as to make them at length thinkable is the problem of the second part of philosophy, or [[metaphysics]]. There is still a class of conceptions requiring more than a logical treatment, but differing from the last in not involving latent contradictions, and in being independent of the reality of their objects, the conceptions that embody our judgments of approval and disapproval; the philosophic treatment of these conceptions falls under [[aesthetics]].

===Logic===

In Herbart's writings logic receives comparatively meagre notice; he insisted strongly on its purely formal character and expressed himself in the main at one with Kantians such as [[Jakob Friedrich Fries|Fries]] and [[Wilhelm Traugott Krug|Krug]].

===Metaphysics&lt;!--'Pluralistic realism' redirects here--&gt;===

As a metaphysician he starts from what he terms the higher [[scepticism]] of the [[David Hume|Hume]]an–[[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] sphere of thought, the beginnings of which he discerns in [[John Locke|Locke]]'s perplexity about the idea of [[Substance theory|substance]]. The validity of even the forms of experience is called in question on account of the contradictions they are found to involve. And yet that these forms are given to us, as truly as sensations are, follows beyond doubt when we consider that we are as little able to control the one as the other. To attempt at this stage a psychological inquiry into the origin of these conceptions would be doubly a mistake; for we should have to use these unlegitimated conceptions in the course of it, and the task of clearing up their contradictions would still remain, whether we succeeded in our enquiry or not.

But how are we to set about this task? We have given to us a conception A uniting among its constituent marks two that prove to be contradictory, say M and N; and we can neither deny the unity nor reject one of the contradictory members. For to do either is forbidden by experience; and yet to do nothing is forbidden by logic. We are thus driven to the assumption that the conception is contradictory because incomplete; but how are we to supplement it? What we have must point the way to what we want, or our procedure will be arbitrary. Experience asserts that M is the same (i.e. a mark of the same concept) as N, while logic denies it; and so it being impossible for one and the same M to sustain these contradictory positions there is but one way open to us; we must posit several Ms. But even now we cannot say one of these Ms is the same as N, another is not; for every M must be both thinkable and valid. We may, however, take the Ms not singly but together; and again, no other course being open to us, this is what we must do; we must assume that N results from a combination of Ms. This is Herbart's method of relations, the counterpart in his system of the [[Georg Hegel|Hegelian]] [[dialectic]].

In the ''[[Ontology]]'' this method is employed to determine what in reality corresponds to the empirical conceptions of substance and cause, or rather of inherence and change. But first we must analyse this notion of reality itself, to which our scepticism had already led us, for, though we could doubt whether the given is what it appears, we cannot doubt that it is something; the conception of the real thus consists of the two conceptions of being and quality. That which we are compelled to posit, which cannot be [[:wikt:sublation|sublated]], is that which is, and in the recognition of this lies the simple conception of being. But when is a thing thus posited? When it is posited as we usually posit the things we see and taste and handle. If we were without sensations, i.e. were never bound against our will to endure the persistence of a presentation, we should never know what being is.

Keeping fast hold of this idea of absolute position, Herbart leads us next to the quality of the real:
#This must exclude everything negative; for non-A sublates instead of positing, and is not absolute, but relative to A.
#The real must be absolutely simple; for if it contain two determinations, A and B, then either these are reducible to one, which is the true quality, or they are not, when each is conditioned by the other and their position is no longer absolute.
#All quantitative conceptions are excluded, for quantity implies parts, and these are incompatible with simplicity.
#But there may be a plurality of reals, albeit the mere conception of being can tell us nothing as to this.

The doctrine here developed is the first cardinal point of Herbart's system, and the name '''pluralistic realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; has been proposed for it by [[Otto Pfleiderer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Pfleiderer]], [https://books.google.gr/books?id=-rRZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= ''The Philosophy of Religion on the Basis of Its History, Volume 2''], Williams and Norgate, 1887, pp. 116, 215, 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contradictions he finds in the common-sense conception of inherence, or of a thing with several attributes, will now become obvious. Take some thing, say A, having ''n'' attributes, ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' ...: we are forced to posit each of these because each is presented in intuition. But in conceiving A we make, not ''n'' positions, still less ''n''+1 positions, but one position simply; for common sense removes the absolute position from its original source, sensation. So when we ask, What is the one posited? we are told the possessor of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' or in other words, their seat or substance. But if so, then A, as a real, being simple, must be equal to ''a''; similarly it must be ''b''; and so on.

Now this would be possible if ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' ... were only [[contingent]] aspects of A, as for example 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, {{radic|64}}, 4+3+1 are contingent aspects of 8. Such, of course, is not the case, and so we have as many contradictions as there are attributes; for we must say A is ''a'', is not ''a'', is ''b'', is not ''b'', etc. There must then, according to the method of relations, be several As. For ''a'' let us assume A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ...&amp;nbsp;; for ''b'', A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ...; and so on for the rest.But now what relation can there be among these several As, which will restore to us the unity of our original A or substance? There is just one; we must assume that the first A of every series is identical, just as the centre is the same point in every radius.

By way of concrete illustration Herbart instances “the common observation that the properties of things exist only under external conditions. Bodies, we say, are coloured, but color is nothing without light, and nothing without eyes. They sound, but only in a vibrating medium, and for healthy ears. Colour and tone present the appearance of inherence, but on looking closer we find they are not really immanent in things but rather presuppose a communion among several.” The result then is briefly thus: In place of the one absolute position, which in some unthinkable way the common understanding substitutes for the absolute positions of the ''n'' attributes, we have really a series of two or more positions for each attribute, every series, however, beginning with the same (as it were, central) real (hence the unity of substance in a group of attributes), but each being continued by different reals (hence the plurality and difference of attributes in unity of substance). Where there is the appearance of inherence, therefore, there is always a plurality of reals; no such correlative to substance as attribute or accident can be admitted at all. Substantiality is impossible without causality, and to this as its true correlative we now turn.

The common-sense conception of change involves at bottom the same contradiction of opposing qualities in one real. The same A that was ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' ... becomes ''a'', ''b'', ''d'' ...; and this, which experience thrusts upon us, proves on reflection unthinkable. The metaphysical supplementing is also fundamentally as before. Since ''c'' depended on a series of reals A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ... in connection with A, and ''d'' may be said similarly to depend on a series A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;+A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;+A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ..., then the change from ''c'' to ''d'' means, not that the central real A or any real has changed, but that A is now in connection with A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, etc., and no longer in connection with A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.

But to think a number of reals in connection (''Zusammensein'') will not suffice as an explanation of phenomena; something or other must happen when they are in connection; what is it? The answer to this question is the second hinge-point of Herbart's theoretical philosophy.

What actually happens as distinct from all that seems to happen, when two reals A and B are together is that, assuming them to differ in quality, they tend to disturb each other to the extent of that difference, at the same time that each preserves itself intact by resisting, as it were, the others disturbance. And so by coining into connection with different reals the self-preservations of A will vary accordingly, A remaining the same through all; just as, by way of illustration, hydrogen remains the same in water and in ammonia, or as the same line may be now a normal and now a tangent. But to indicate this opposition in the qualities of the reals A+B, we must substitute for these symbols others, which, though only contingent aspects of A and B, i.e. representing their relations, not themselves, yet like similar devices in mathematics enable thought to advance. Thus we may put A = ''&amp;alpha;''+''&amp;beta;''-''&amp;gamma;'', B = ''m''+''n''+''&amp;gamma;''; ''&amp;gamma;'' then represents the character of the
self-preservations in this case, and ''&amp;alpha;''+''&amp;beta;''+''m''+''n'' represents all that could be observed by a spectator who did not know the simple qualities, but was himself involved in the relations of A to B; and such is exactly our position.

Having thus determined what really is and what actually happens, our philosopher proceeds next to explain synthetically the objective semblance (''der objective Schein'') that results from these. But if this construction is to be truly objective, i.e. valid for all intelligences, ontology must furnish us with a clue. This we have in the forms of Space, Time and Motion which are involved whenever we think the reals as being in, or coming into, connection and the opposite. These forms then cannot be merely the products of our psychological mechanism, though they may turn out to coincide with these. Meanwhile, let us call them intelligible, as being valid for all who comprehend the real and actual by thought, although no such forms are predicable of the real and actual themselves.

The elementary spatial relation Herbart conceives to be “the contiguity (''Aneinander'') of two points,” so that every “pure and independent line” is discrete. But an investigation of dependent lines which are often incommensurable forces us to adopt the contradictory fiction of partially overlapping, i.e. divisible points, or in other words, the conception of Continuity.&lt;ref group=note&gt;
Hence Herbart gave the name ''synechology'' to this branch of metaphysics, instead of the usual one, [[cosmology]].
&lt;/ref&gt; But the contradiction here is one we cannot eliminate by the method of relations, because it does not involve anything real; and in fact as a necessary outcome of an intelligible form, the fiction of continuity is valid for the objective semblance. By its help we are enabled to comprehend what actually happens among reals to produce the appearance of water. When three or more reals are together, each disturbance and self-preservation will (in general) be imperfect, i.e. of less intensity than when only two reals are together. But objective semblance corresponds with reality; the spatial or external relations of the reals in this case must, therefore, tally with their inner or actual states. Had the self-preservations been perfect, the coincidence in space would have been complete, and the group of reals would have been inextended; or had the several reals been simply contiguous, i.e. without connection, then, as nothing would actually have happened, nothing would appear. As it is we shall find a continuous molecule manifesting attractive and repulsive forces; attraction corresponding to the tendency of the self-preservations to become perfect, repulsion to the frustration of this. Motion, even more evidently than space, implicates the contradictory conception of continuity and cannot, therefore, be a real predicate, though valid as an intelligible form and necessary to the comprehension of the objective semblance. For we have to think of the reals as absolutely independent and yet as entering into connections. This we can only do by conceiving them as originally moving through intelligible space in rectilinear paths and with uniform velocities. For such motion no cause need be supposed; motion, in fact, is no more a state of the moving real than rest is, both alike being but relations, with which, therefore, the real has no concern. The changes in this motion, however, for which we should require a cause, would be the objective semblance of the self-preservations that actually occur when reals meet. Further, by means of such motion these actual occurrences, which are in themselves timeless, fall for an observer in a definite time — a time which becomes continuous through the partial coincidence of events.

But in all this it has been assumed that we are spectators of the objective semblance; it remains to make good this assumption, or, in other words, to show the possibility of knowledge; this is the problem of what Herbart terms Eidolology, and forms the transition from metaphysic to psychology. Here, again, a contradictory conception blocks the way, that, viz. of the Ego as the identity of knowing and being, and as such the stronghold of idealism. The contradiction becomes more evident when the ego is denned to be a subject (and so a real) that is its own object. As real and not merely formal, this conception of the ego is amenable to the method of relations. The solution this method furnishes is summarily that there are several objects which mutually modify each other, and so constitute that ego we take for the presented real. But to explain this modification is the business of psychology; it is enough now to see that the subject like all reals is necessarily unknown and that, therefore, the idealist's theory of knowledge is unsound. But though the simple quality of the subject or soul is beyond knowledge, we know what actually happens when it is in connection with other's reals, for its self-preservations then are what we call sensations. And these sensations are the sole material of our knowledge; but they are not given to us as a chaos but in definite groups and series, whence we come to know the relations of those reals, which, though themselves unknown, our sensations compel us to posit absolutely.

===Principles of education ===

Herbart's pedagogy emphasised the connection between individual development and the resulting societal contribution. In Platonic tradition, Herbart espoused that only by becoming productive citizens could people fulfill their true purpose: “He believed that every child is born with a unique potential, his Individuality, but that this potential remained unfulfilled until it was analysed and transformed by education in accordance with what he regarded as the accumulated values of civilisation”.{{sfn|Blyth|1981|p=70}}  Only formalised, rigorous education could, he believed, provide the framework for moral and intellectual development. The five key ideas which composed his concept of individual maturation were Inner Freedom, Perfection, Benevolence, Justice and Equity or Recompense.{{sfn|Blyth|1981|p=72}}

According to Herbart, abilities were not innate but could be instilled, so a thorough education could provide the framework for moral and intellectual development. In order to develop an educational paradigm that would provide an intellectual base that would lead to a consciousness of social responsibility, Herbart advocated that teachers utilise a methodology with five formal steps: “Using this structure a teacher prepared a topic of 
interest to the children, presented that topic, and questioned them inductively, so that they reached new knowledge based on what they had already known, looked back and deductively summed up the lesson's achievements, then related them to moral precepts for daily living”.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=114}}

In order to appeal to learners' interests, Herbart advocated using literature and historical stories instead of the drier basal readers that were popular at the time. Whereas the moralistic tales in many of the primers and readers of the period were predictable and allegorical, Herbart felt that children would appreciate the psychological and literary nuances of the masterpieces of the canon.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=111}}

Though he died in 1841, his pedagogy enjoyed a renaissance of sorts in the mid-19th century; while Germany was its intellectual centre, it "found a ready echo in those countries such as the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in which the development of Individuality into Character appeared particularly well attuned to the prevailing economic, political and social circumstances."{{sfn|Blyth|1981|p=77}} Among those who espoused and advocated his ideas in the United Kingdom was [[Catherine Isabella Dodd]].&lt;ref&gt;C. I. Dodd (1904).&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of individual potentiality and civic responsibility seemed to reflect democratic ideals.

Though the emphasis on character building through literary appreciation diminished somewhat after the movement toward utilitarianism following the [[First World War]], Herbart's pedagogy continues to influence the field by raising important questions about the role of critical thinking, and literary appreciation in education.

===Aesthetics and ethics===

Aesthetics elaborates the ideas involved in the expression called forth by those relations of object which acquire for them attribution of beauty or the reverse. The beautiful is to be carefully distinguished from the allied conceptions of the useful or the pleasant, which vary with time, place and person; whereas beauty is predicated absolutely and involuntarily by all who have attained the right standpoint. Ethics, which is but one branch of aesthetics, although the chief, deals with such relations among volitions (''Willensverhältnisse'') as thus unconditionally please or displease. These relations Herbart finds to be reducible to five, which do admit of further simplification; and corresponding to them are as many moral ideas (''Musterbegriffe''), as follows:
#Internal Freedom, the underlying relation being that of the individual's will to his judgment of it
#Perfection, the relation being that of his several volitions each other in respect of intensity, variety and concentration
#Benevolence, the relation being that between his own will and the thought of another's
#Right, in case of actual conflict with other
#Retribution or Equity, for intended good or evil
The ideas of a final society, a system of rewards and punishments, a system of administration, a system of culture and an animated society, corresponding to the ideas of law, equity, benevolence, perfection and internal freedom respectively, result when we take account of a number of individuals. Virtue is the perfect conformity of the will with the moral ideas; of this the single virtues are but special expressions. The conception of duty arises from the existence of hindrances to the attainment of virtue. A general scheme of principles of conduct is possible, but the sublimation of special cases under these must remain matter of fact. The application of ethics to things as they are with a view to the realisation of the moral ideas is moral technology (''Tugendlehre''), which the chief divisions are Paedagogy and Politics.

===Theology===

In [[theology]] Herbart held the [[argument from design]] to be as valid of divine activity as for human, and to justify the belief in a supersensible real, concerning which, however, exact knowledge is neither tenable nor on practical grounds desirable.

==Psychology==

===Herbart's concept of the ''Real''===

Building upon the teaching methods of Pestalozzi, Herbart contributed to pedagogy a psychological basis to help facilitate better learning as well as to ensure children’s character development. He was the first individual to point out how important a role psychology plays on education. In developing his ideas about psychology, Herbart came to disagree with Kant about how true knowledge is obtained. Kant believed that we become knowledgeable through studying the innate categories of thought, while Herbart believed that one learns only from studying external and real objects in the world as well as the ideas that come about from observing them. Examining the difference between the actual existence of an object and its appearance, Herbart concluded that “the world is a world of things-in-themselves [and] the things-in-themselves are perceivable.”{{sfn|Wolman|1968|p=33}} Everything’s appearance indicates that it exists. He considered all external objects existing in the world as ''reals'', which can be compared to [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz's]] concept of [[Monadology|monads]].
 								
Subscribing to [[John Locke|Locke's]] empiricist viewpoint involving the ''[[tabula rasa]]'', Herbart believed that the soul had no innate ideas or no already pre-established Kantian categories of thought. The soul, considered to be a ''real'', was thought to be completely passive initially as well as very resistant to changes outside factors exert and force upon it. Even though ''reals'' are disrupted by other forces appearing to cause a change in the ''reals'' themselves, they are thought to be unchangeable. ''Reals'' tend to collide and struggle with one another so much so that each ''real'' fights for its own self-preservation (Selbsterhaltung). The way in which the soul helps to preserve itself from its outwardly perceived destruction is through Herbart’s concept of Vorstellungen, or ideas or mental representations. These ideas were regarded as dynamic forces that Herbart attempted to explain by means of mathematical formulas. [[Isaac Newton|Newton’s]] influence can be seen in Herbart’s beliefs about how forces mechanically interact with one another in the world to affect perceptions of reality. The mechanics of ideas involved their ability to move in different ways, whether they be moving up into the conscious or delving down into the unconscious. Different ideas come into contact with each other and result in more complex ideas through the processes of blending, fusing, fading and combining in a multitude of approaches. It is evident Herbart thought that ideas were not precise imitations of the existing items in the world but that they were the direct consequence of the interactions of individuals’ experiences with the external environment. An individual can only gain all the facts and their associated truth by understanding how their mental representations combine and potentially inhibit or contribute to one another.

===Apperception===

Herbart believed ideas crossed a [[limen]] of consciousness, or a boundary between the [[consciousness|conscious]] and the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]], as they became clearer and strong enough to preserve themselves against their struggle with other forces. The ideas powerful enough to break through to the conscious formed the apperceiving mass, or a congregation of similar and related ideas dominating the conscious at any given moment. Expounding upon [[Leibniz]]’s concept of pétites perceptions and the idea of [[apperception]], Herbart believed the apperceiving mass to be crucial in selecting similar ideas from down in the unconscious to join its forces in the conscious. Although the individual is focusing all of his/her attention on those complex ideas a part of the apperceiving mass in the conscious, it is possible for ideas in the unconscious to combine with other ideas related to them and struggle to break through the limen into the conscious, disrupting the present ideas a part of the apperceiving mass. Apperception played a key role in Herbart’s educational theory. He saw apperception as more pivotal in the classroom than sense-perception because focusing on a child’s apperceiving mass in relation to the material being taught can inform teachers of how to implement the material in such a way as to direct the child’s ideas and thoughts to attend to certain information.

==Biographies==
There is a life of Herbart in Hartenstein's introduction to his ''Kleinere philosophische Schriften und Abhandlungen'' (1842–1843) and by F. H. T. Allihn in ''Zeitschrift für exacte Philosophie'' (Leipzig, 1861), the organ of Herbart and his school, which ceased to appear in 1873. In America the National Society for the Scientific Study of Education was founded as the National Herbart Society.

==Bibliography==
Herbart's works were collected and published by his disciple G. Hartenstein (Leipzig, 1850–1852; reprinted at Hamburg, with supplementary volume, 1883–1893); another edition by [[Karl Kehrbach]] (Leipzig, 1882, and Langensalza, 1887).

The following are the most important:
*''Allgemeine Pädagogik'' (1806; new ed., 1894)
*''Hauptpunkte der Metaphysik'' (1808)
*''Allgemeine praktische Philosophie'' (1808)

'''''Journal Citation Reports''''' ('''''JCR''''') is an [[annual publication]] by [[Clarivate Analytics]] (previously the intellectual property of [[Thomson Reuters]]). It has been integrated with the [[Web of Science]] and is accessed from the Web of Science-Core Collections. It provides information about [[academic journal]]s in the [[natural sciences]] and [[social sciences]], including [[impact factor]]s. The ''JCR'' was originally published as a part of ''[[Science Citation Index]]''. Currently, the ''JCR'', as a distinct service, is based on [[citation]]s compiled from the ''[[Science Citation Index Expanded]]'' and the ''[[Social Science Citation Index]]''.&lt;ref name=evolves&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garfield |first=Eugene |year=2007 |title=The evolution of the Science Citation Index |journal=[[International Microbiology]] |doi=10.2436/20.1501.01.10 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=65–69 |url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/barcelona2007a.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JCRhome&gt;{{cite web |year=2010 |title=Overview |work=Journal Citation Reports |publisher=Thomson Reuters |url=http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/journal_citation_reports |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625025211/http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/journal_citation_reports |archivedate=2010-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |year=2010 |title=About Us |publisher=Thomson Reuters |url=http://thomsonreuters.com/about/ |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VenSep2009&gt;{{cite journal |last=Venkatraman |first=Archana |date=Sep 2009 |title=Journals cherish IF status symbol: but impact factor is not the only citation metric that matters |newspaper=[[Information World Review]] |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic journal information==
The information given for each journal includes:
* the basic bibliographic information of publisher,  title abbreviation, language, ISSN
* the subject categories (there are 171 such categories in the sciences and 54 in the social sciences)

==Citation information==
* Basic citation data:
** the number of articles published during that year and
** the number of times the articles in the journal were cited during the year by later articles in itself and other journals,
* detailed tables showing
** the number of times the articles in the journal were cited during the year by later articles in itself and other journals,
** the number of citations made from articles published in the journal that year to it and other specific individual journals during each of the most recent ten years (the 20 journals most cited are included)
** the number of times articles published in the journal during each of the most recent 10 years were cited by individual specific journals during the year (the twenty journals with the greatest number of citation are given)
* and several measures derived from these data for a given journal: its ''[[impact factor]]'', ''[[immediacy index]]'', etc.

There are separate editions for the sciences and the social sciences; the 2013 science edition includes 8,411 journals, and the 2012 social science edition contains 3,016 titles. The issue for each year is published the following year, after the citations for the year have been published and the information processed.

The publication is available online (''JCR on the Web''), or in CD format (''JCR on CD-ROM''); it was originally published in print, with the detailed tables on [[microfiche]].

==Release schedule==
In recent years, it is often released in the middle of June. For example, the 2017 Journal Citation Reports, based on 2016 data, was released on Jun 14, 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://clarivate.com/blog/the-2017-jcr-release-is-here/|title=The 2017 JCR Release is Here! - Clarivate|date=14 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Leibniz Institute for Polymer Research''' in [[Dresden]] ({{lang-de| Leibniz-Institut für Polymerforschung}}) – in short [[IPF Dresden]] – is a non-university [[research institute]] and a member of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]]. The IPF is carrying out fundamental as well as application-oriented research in all areas of [[polymer science]] and investigates [[polymer]] materials with new or improved characteristics. In the material development, emphasis is given to [[nanotechnological]] aspects as well as to biosystem interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipfdd.de/en/home/], Homepage [[IPF Dresden]], retrieved 5 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The IPF’s research program is jointly set up and implemented by scientists of the different IPF institutes. It comprises the following four research areas:

* Functional nanostructured interfaces and polymer systems
* Biology-inspired interface and material design
* Polymer networks: Structure, theory, and application
* Process-controlled structure formation in polymer materials

==Structure==
The IPF consists of five research institutes
*Institute [[Macromolecular Chemistry]], Director: Prof. Dr. [[Brigitte Voit]]
*Institute of [[Physical Chemistry]] and Polymer Physics, Director: Prof. Dr. Andreas Fery
* Institute of Polymer Materials, Director: Prof. Dr.-Ing. Udo Wagenknecht (provisionally)
*Institute for Biofunctional Polymer Materials, Director: Prof. Dr. Carsten Werner
* Institute Theory of Polymers, Director: Prof. Dr. Jens-Uwe Sommer

Close ties exists to the [[TU Dresden]], one of eleven universities distinguished as a "University of Excellence" by the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative]]. Common projects include the Max Bergmann Center of Biomaterials,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbc-dresden.de/], Homepage Max Bergmann Center of Biomaterials, retrieved 5 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and two so-called Clusters of Excellence, the "Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden" (CRTD)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crt-dresden.de/about/], Homepage CRTD, retrieved 5 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden (cfaed) - TU Dresden|"Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden" (CfAED)]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/news], Homepage CfAED, retrieved 5 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The IPF Dresden was founded on January 1, 1992 emerging from the largest polymer research center of the former [[GDR]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipfdd.de/en/home/history/], [[IPF Dresden]]: History, retrieved 5 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; which was at the time already internationally acknowledged. Since then the IPF Dresden developed into a leading institute in selected topics of polymer science.
At present the IPF employs about 480 people, and about 100 guest scientists from all over the world come every year for some weeks or months to work at the IPF. The annual budget of 25 Million Euro is supplied in equal parts by the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] and the German [[federal states]]. In addition to institutional funding the IPF Dresden raises project resources of about 8 Million Euro per year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipfdd.de/en/home/facts//], [[IPF Dresden]]: Facts, retrieved 5 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Literacy Florida! Inc., which is also known as Volunteers for Adult Literacy in Florida (VALF) is a [[nonprofit organization]] which provides training, technical assistance and grants for volunteer literacy programs.

== History ==
Starting in 2008, the organization started a small grant program for members. In August 2008, '''Literacy Florida! Inc.''', was renamed Volunteers for Adult Literacy in Florida.  VALF provides grants, training, and technical support for adult and family [[literacy]] programs using trained [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s.  

== Operations ==
According to this organization, around 74 million adults in the United States lack minimum literacy skills; one in five adults is still not literate and two-thirds of them are women.  Statistics on Florida can be found at the Florida Literacy Coalition. [http://www.floridaliteracy.org/about_literacy__facts_and_statistics.html]

VALF provides information and services to Florida literacy volunteers and providers in program management, [[adult learner]] persistence, communications and networking, technical assistance and training, [[public policy|public affairs]], [[advocacy]], and student leadership. 

VALF is a member of [[ProLiteracy Worldwide]].  Agencies running volunteer literacy programs include libraries, churches, school systems, and colleges.  Civic clubs such as [[Altrusa]] have a history of supporting literacy and some of clubs have helped adult literacy programs get started.

Florida's volunteer literacy programs reach adults who read at the lowest [[Reading (process)|reading]] level and those needing help learning English. Programs are administered through public libraries such as the [[Jacksonville Public Library (Florida)]] or by independent [[nonprofit]] groups.  

Potential volunteers do not need to have teaching experience. Those who tutor conversational English do not need to know a foreign language.  

Most programs require volunteers to attend a tutor training workshop on basic [[Reading (process)|reading]] workshop or on [[English for Speakers of Other Languages]] ([[English language learning and teaching|ESOL]]) to learn how to tutor. Some programs provide combined workshop. Each program develops their own criteria for participation, but tutors are often required to be 18 years old and have a high school diploma. Most must attend an initial training and participate in in-service opportunities and agree to tutor weekly for six months to a year.  Well organized programs provide ongoing support for tutors and students.

Programs also use volunteers as tutor trainers, in administrative functions and for tutor and student support.  

LFva holds their annual meeting at the Florida Literacy Conference which is sponsored by the Florida Literacy Coalition [http://www.floridaliteracy.org] in the spring.

      <comment>/* List of mega journals */  Zootaxa was deleted from the list. It is not a gold open-access megajournal</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14758">A '''mega journal''' (also '''mega-journal''' and '''megajournal''') is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal|academic]] [[open access journal]] designed to be much larger than a traditional journal by exercising low selectivity among accepted articles. It was pioneered by ''[[PLOS ONE]]''.&lt;ref name=Beall2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bjork/&gt; This highly lucrative publishing model&lt;ref name=Bjork/&gt; was soon emulated by other publishers.

==Definition==
A mega journal has the following defining characteristics:
* broad coverage of different subject areas;&lt;ref name=Beall2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bjork/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiley/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lboro/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binfield/&gt;
* accepting articles for publication based on whether they are technically sound rather than selecting for perceived importance;&lt;ref name=Beall2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bjork/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiley/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lboro/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binfield/&gt;&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt; and
* using [[article processing charge]]s to cover the costs of publishing.&lt;ref name=Beall2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiley/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binfield/&gt;
Other less universal characteristics are
* "an accelerated review and publication process",&lt;ref name=Bjork/&gt; "fast [[turnaround time]]";&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt; 
* "academic editors",&lt;ref name=Norman/&gt; even "a large editorial board of academic editors",&lt;ref name=Binfield/&gt; (instead of professional editors); and
* value-added services such as reusable graphics and data through [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] licenses.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Björk|first=Bo-Christer|title=Have the "mega-journals" reached the limits to growth?|url=https://peerj.com/articles/981|journal=PeerJ|volume=3|doi=10.7717/peerj.981|pmc=4451030|pmid=26038735|page=e981}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mega journals are also online-only, with no printed version, and are fully open access, in contrast to [[hybrid open access]] journals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some [[Predatory open access publishing|"predatory" open access publishers]] use the mega journal model.&lt;ref name=Beall2013/&gt;

== Influence ==
It has been suggested that the academic journal landscape might become dominated by a few mega journals in the future, at least in terms of total number of articles published.&lt;ref&gt;Hayahiko Ozono, Okayama University, Participants' Report on The 5th SPARC Japan Seminar 2011. “Burgeoning Open Access MegaJournals”. National Institute of Informatics. [http://www.nii.ac.jp/sparc/en/publications/newsletter/13/topics2.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
Megajournals are also disrupting{{clarify|date=October 2014}} the market of [[article processing charges]].&lt;ref name=Solomon2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Solomon|first1=David J.|title=A survey of authors publishing in four megajournals|journal=PeerJ|date=2014|volume=2|pages=e365|doi=10.7717/peerj.365|url=https://peerj.com/articles/365/|pmid=24795855|pmc=4006221}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Their business model may not motivate reviewers, who donate their time to "influence their field, gain exposure to the most current cutting edge research or list their service to a prestigious journal on their CVs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/2158244013507271
| title = Open Access, Megajournals, and MOOCs: On the Political Economy of Academic Unbundling
| journal = SAGE Open
| volume = 3
| issue = 4
| year = 2013
| last1 = Wellen
| first1 = R.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, they may no longer serve as "fora for the exchange ... among colleagues in a particular field or sub-field", as traditionally happened in scholarly journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beall|first=Jeffrey |year=2013|title= The Open-Access Movement is Not Really about Open Access|journal= tripleC|volume=11|number=2|pages=589–597|url=http://www.triple-c.at/index.php/tripleC/article/view/525}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counter that indiscrimination, ''[[PLOS ONE]]'', the prototypical megajournal, has started to "package relevant articles into subject-specific collections."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001235| title = Why ONE is More Than 5| journal = PLoS Biology| volume = 9| issue = 12| pages = e1001235| year = 2011| last1 = MacCallum | first1 = C. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Bierut''' (born 1957) is a graphic designer, design critic and educator who designed the logo for [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign]].

Bierut was born in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. He studied [[graphic design]] at the [[University of Cincinnati]]'s [[University of Cincinnati College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning|College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pentagram.com/en/partners/michael-bierut.php|title=Biography at Pentagram|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330152444/http://pentagram.com/en/partners/michael-bierut.php|archivedate=2010-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bierut was vice president of graphic design at Vignelli Associates. Since 1990 he has been a partner in the New York office of [[Pentagram (design studio)|Pentagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pentagram.com/en/partners-bierut.htm|title=Pentagram - the world’s largest independent design consultancy|website=Pentagram}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to his Pentagram online biography: Bierut "is responsible for leading a team of graphic designers who create identity design, [[environmental graphic design]] and editorial design solutions. He has won hundreds of design awards and his work is represented in several permanent collections including: the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) and the [[Cooper-Hewitt]], National Design Museum in New York; the [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington, DC]]; the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] (SFMOMA); the Denver Art Museum; the [[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg]], Germany; and the [[Museum of Design Zürich|Museum für Gestaltung]] in Zürich, Switzerland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pentagram.com/en/partners/michael-bierut.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330152444/http://pentagram.com/en/partners/michael-bierut.php |archivedate=2010-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bierut served as the national president of the [[American Institute of Graphic Arts]] ([[AIGA]]) from 1998 to 2001.

Bierut is a senior critic in graphic design at the [[Yale School of Art]].

Bierut is also the co-editor of three Looking Closer graphic design anthologies. He is also a founding writer of the [[Design Observer]] blog with [[Rick Poynor]], [[William Drenttel]] and [[Jessica Helfand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designobserver.com/masthead.html|title=Design Observer|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316192329/http://www.designobserver.com/masthead.html|archivedate=2010-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bierut currently serves on the governing board of the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]''; in January, 2007, he redesigned the ''Bulletin's'' [[Doomsday Clock]] to give it a more modern feel. Bierut is also known for his involvement in the film ''[[Helvetica (film)|Helvetica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0847817/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm ''Helvetica''] [[IMDb]] listing ("Full credits"); Michael Bierut appeared as himself. Retrieved 2014-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Michael Bierut was born in 1957 in Cleveland, Ohio. During his time in Ohio, graphic design was not promoted to young adults. His love of fine art, music, and drawing that united in the form of album covers led him to the only two books in the library at the time on design, the ''Graphic Design Manual'' by Armin Hofman and ''Milton Glaser: Graphic Design''. He did not need any more convincing and studied graphic design at the University of Cincinnati's College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning.&lt;ref&gt;Graphic Communications&lt;/ref&gt;
While in school, he did an internship that allowed him to study under Chris Pullman, another AIGA medalist. They worked together at a Boston public television station, WGBH. Michael Bierut graduated in 1980 from the University of Cincinnati’s College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning. Before becoming partners with Pentagram in 1990 he worked ten years Vignelli Associates, as a vice president. When he was working for Vignelli Associates he had serious industry clout but it also implanted a keystone principle of his career. "Probably the most interesting thing I learned is that a lot of the things about design that tend to get designers really interested aren't that important," Bierut once said to Steven Heller. Bierut acknowledges that people might not actually read the annual reports and corporate brochures that designers make. So he strives to make things that people are able to read and want to read. Pullman has stated that, "He has a quality that I have much respect for in the kind of work that we do" and "He's a person who's very easy to understand, both when you talk to him and when he's doing his work. He's accessible, humane, funny when it's appropriate, and witty almost all of the time. And that's a very important quality for someone who wants to be a communicator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiga.org/medalist-michaelbierut|title=2006 AIGA Medalist: Michael Bierut|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vignelli==
In an article on AIGA, Bierut states that when he graduated from Ohio he started working for Vignelli Associates in New York. He says that there was not a computer and that the office didn’t even have a fax machine, making design in an office in those days very different. Spending most of his days putting thinner in rubber cement and taping tissue paper over mechanical boards, he would on occasion get to do a mechanical himself. He was able to get an apartment that was three blocks from the Vignelli office. He had a key to the office and would go work another shift after tucking his wife into bed. This shift lasted from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. and this went on for four years. He credits his achievements to those four years. While at the office he would design things like invitations for his friends' parties, packaging for mix tapes, one-of-a-kind birthday cards, and freebies for non-profits. After Massimo Vignelli noticed that Bierut had extra time he started giving him more work. The extra work that would normally take two days took one day because of the night shift. The more work he got, the faster he became and better he became at doing it. His advice to any beginning a career in design is to stay while you can.&lt;ref&gt;Inspiration&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pentagram==
While at Pentagram Bierut has had numerous clients such as Alliance for Downtown New York, Benetton, the Council of Fashion Designers of America, Alfred A. Knopf, the Walt Disney Company, Mohawk Paper Mills, Motorola, MillerCoors, the Toy Industry Association, Princeton University, Yale School of Architecture, New York University, the Fashion Institute of Technology, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Library of Congress, the Museum of Sex, and the New York Jets. Michael Bierut has done projects like ''I Want To Take You Higher'', an exhibition on the psychedelic era for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and even serving as a design consultant to United Airlines. Dwell turns to him for design book recommendations and Fast Company gets his opinion on corporate branding. 
Recently he has developed a new signage and identity for the expanded Morgan Library Museum. He has also developed the environmental graphics for the New York Times building, as well as designed for Phillip Johnson's Glass House and redesigned the magazine ''The Atlantic''. Along with that, he has created marketing strategies for William Jefferson Clinton Foundation and developed a new brand strategy and packaging for Saks Fifth Avenue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pentagram Profile&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration studies is an interdisciplinary field which draws on [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[economics]], [[law]], [[sociology]] and [[postcolonial studies]]. As it is a rapidly growing field of study, there are numerous journals dedicated to it.&lt;ref&gt;For a review of the relevant literature see Stephen Castles and Mark Miller, The age of migration, Palgrave Macmillan, 2009 and Massey Worlds in Motion: Understanding International Migration at the End of the Millennium, Oxford University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; A leading one is the ''Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies'', based at the [[University of Sussex]], which covers modern human migration.&lt;ref name="nyt2008"&gt;{{cite news|title=Online journal chronicles global migration|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/04/world/americas/04iht-migrate.1.9720151.html|accessdate=13 March 2017|agency=''[[New York Times]]''|date=4 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2017}} In February 2013, [[Oxford University Press]] launched the international peer-reviewed journal ''Migration Studies'', which publishes material on the causes, processes, and results of all forms of human migration.&lt;ref name="oup-ms-about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/migration/pages/About|website=Migration Studies|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue was released in March 2013.

In [[epidemiology]], an "immigration study" is a method of understanding the relative importance of inherited genetics and environmental factor in medical conditions whose incidence varies around the world. It examines the incidence of conditions in populations who have moved (or whose recent ancestors have moved) between places at different rates. Often the immigrant population can be shown to have similar rates to the population of the new location, suggesting that environmental factors such as diet, obesity and exercise are the dominant determinants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cancer Incidence in U.S. Immigrant Populations - Landmark Studies|url=http://seer.cancer.gov/archive/studies/surveillance/study5.html|website=National Institutes of Health|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Naser was born in [[Munshiganj District]] in erstwhile [[East Pakistan]] to his parents Mr. M. Ismail Ali Khan and Abida Begum.&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2005/05/17/d505171502104.htm|title=Lest We Forget Dr M A Naser: A pioneer in engineering education|accessdate=2 February 2015|date=17 May 2005|publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]|author=Dr. Mohammed Muniruzzaman}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his early education at the Kazir Pagla A. T. Institution at [[Lohajang Upazila]] in Munshiganj. In 1937 he passed the Matriculation Examination in the First Division. He completed the Intermediate Examination from the B. M. College, [[Barisal]]. He received the B.Sc (Hons.) and M.Sc. degrees, in Chemistry from the [[University of Dhaka]], in 1942 and 1943 respectively. Then he went to the [[Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur|Bengal Engineering College at Shibpur]], West Bengal to study [[Chemical Engineering]].

He got a scholarship to study for his M.S. in Chemical Engineering at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]], USA. This was a notable achievement for him to be selected for such a scholarship in undivided India. In 1962 he again went to United States for his Ph.D. He completed his Ph.D. in four years. Of four years, he spent about two years at [[Columbia University]], and then he went to [[Texas A&amp;M University]] to complete the rest of his Ph.D.. He went to London under a fellowship from the [[Nuffield Foundation]] to study for a year at the [[University of London]] In 1955.

==Career==
After returning to East Pakistan, Naser first joined at the Industries Ministry, and then joined at the Directorate of Technical Education. After a short while he joined the faculty in ''Ahsanullah Engineering College'' (later became BUET). In 1970 he became the vice-chancellor of BUET and continued holding his position after the liberation of Bangladesh. Naser is credited for the first convocation of BUET which was held in 1973. He became the chairman of the [[University Grants Commission (Bangladesh)|University Grants Commission]] in 1975. He retired from this position in 1980. He was a professor emeritus of Chemical Engineering in BUET until his death.

==Background==
Cynthia was born on 10 November 1987 in Agbor town, [[Delta State]]
Cynthia Okogosu was the last child and only daughter of her parents, retired major-general Frank Osokogu and Joy-Rita Nkem Osokogu. She had three elder brothers. Her eldest brother is Flight Lieutenant Kenneth Uchechukwu Osokogu. Her immediate elder brother is an Assistant Superintendent of Customs, Mr. Williams Ehiedu Osokogu. Her third elder brother, Mr. Tony Azubike Osokogu, lived in Greece.
She started schooling at the Command Children School, [[Ilorin]] and moved to the Command Secondary School, [[Jos]] from 1997 to 2004. She was a graduate of English Language at [[Nasarawa State University]] and was pursuing a Master’s degree in Public Administration in the same institution after resigning from a job with [[MTN Group|MTN]]. Cynthia was also a former model. She, owned a boutique 'Dress Code' which she opened in Keffi, a town in [[Nasarawa State]] in 2007. She was described as hardworking, loving and industrious by her family. She had achieved so much at age 24.

==Incident==
Cynthia developed some friendships via  the social networking site Facebook after chatting with a newly added “friend”; Okwumi Echezona Nwabufor via her [[BlackBerry Messenger]] over the pace of about four months and soon she had also "friended" his cousin, Ezike Ilechukwu Olisaeloka. Even though she already had a relation in the United States who often sent her goods to sell in her retailing business, they told her they were in the same business, that they were also retailers and offered to sell her the items at cheaper prices. She believed them. These young men seemed normal and promised to host Cynthia when she came to Lagos. What Cynthia didn't know was that Nwabufor had been stalking her for months, patiently gaining her confidence through frequent chats and postings. When she informed them she usually comes to buy goods in Lagos, they made arrangements for her visit while promising to help her get the goods at cheaper prices. The trip was organized by Echezona Nwabufor, one of the two new friends. On July 21, 2012, Cynthia flew to Lagos from the Abuja to meet with these new "retailers" regarding the better price offer on the clothes and accessories for her fashion boutique. After landing, she called her mother to tell her that she had arrived safely. The two young men picked Cynthia up from the [[Murtala Muhammed International Airport]], Ikeja and drove her to Cosmilla Hotel in  Lakeview estate in [[Festac Town]]. At the hotel, they entertained her with a [[Ribena]] drink (unknown to her the drink was already drugged with [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol Flunitrazepam]].) Their effort to drug her drink was fruitless as they discovered the drug “did not work" quickly on her. After that, they beat her and asked her to reveal where she kept her money. They presumed she would hold a lot of money, but she said she didn’t have any money to spare. When they didn’t get any money from her, they tied her up, robbed her of all the money she brought to shop for her business, her three blackberry phones, jewelries, international passport, a drivers’ licence, then they raped her and finally strangled her to death.
The next morning, after having spent the night with Cynthia's body, they then abandoned her, left the hotel and quickly [[Friending and following|unfriended]] her from their Facebook friends list to remove any trace of their connection. Unknown to them, there was a hidden [[CCTV]] camera in the hotel which recorded part of the event.
According to the hotel receptionist's account (Ms. Ifeyinwa Njebu). The two checked in at the hotel at 8 a.m. on July 21st, 2012. By the time they checked out, she had handed over to the second receptionist (Vivian Anuonye), who had taken over duty; so she asked her to check them out. They checked in again (with Cynthia) at the hotel at about 12 a.m. on July 21, 2012. When Ms. Njebu resumed the next day by July 22nd, Vivian handed over to her and gave her details about the room already occupied.
The room that Ms Njebu checked in the couple was to expire on July 22nd, 12 noon. After the two left in the morning, his brother came to take over the room. So she noted that and she was also aware that the other person as still occupying the room. Mrs. Njebu routinely called all the rooms in the hotel to ascertain those who are still in and those about to check out. After sometime, she saw Nwabufor coming down the stairs. Mrs. Njebu asked Nwabufor after calling his room to know if he was still staying. When Nwabufor reached down the stairs, he told her that he would be staying behind but that she should permit him to withdraw money from the ATM machine to pay for the day. When he told her his girlfriend (referring to Cynthia) was still upstairs, she did not go to check. He was not a regular guest at the hotel. He assured her that his girlfriend was there with the room key. Mrs. Njebu told Mr. Nwabufor to return to the hotel before 12 noon, when the payment for their room would expire. He didn’t submit the key to her. Olisaeloka came out from the bar and they both left the hotel. She never saw them again. At about 3 p.m. she received a phone call from one of them. The caller said that he was the occupant of the room who left recently and that he was not coming back and he instructed her to remove the "idiot" out of the room. She replied him politely to remind him that, he promised to come back and pay for the day. He said he was not coming back and dropped the call. Mrs. Njebu informed the hotel’s manager about the development and he assured her that since the caller’s girlfriend is still in; she would pay for the room. So the manager told her to call the room through the intercom. She called many times but no response. The manager went upstairs, knocked several times but didn't get any response. The hotel management directed her to use the master key to access the room, as a last resort. So she went upstairs, knocked again. After, no one responded, she used her master key to open the door. And from the door, she saw Cynthia's lifeless body lying naked on the bed. She was lying horizontal with her legs touching the ground. She screamed with shock and rushed downstairs to inform the manager, who alerted the police.
From the CCTV footage played to her by the police, Mrs. Njebu identified Messrs Nwabufo and Olisaeloka.
She was able to recognize the duo when the police brought them to the Area E police station in Festac Town, Lagos.
After the hotel found her body, since her ID cards and mobile phones had been stolen, they could not identify her immediately or call friends and family. Her body was deposited in a morgue in Lagos.

All this time, unaware of Cynthia's murder, her family and friends were praying for her safe return. Meanwhile, Cynthia's mother Mrs. Osokogu tried calling Cynthia's cell phone for five days but her phone was switched off. On the seventh day, she recalled that one of the men picked her call and told her that Cynthia was sick. Not too long afterwards, they implied that Cynthia had been kidnapped and asked her mother for 20 million Naira ransome money. Cynthia's mum asked them if they killed her daughter and they said no, she was just sick and couldn't come to the phone. The phone call was traced to Festac. There, her missing person’s police report was submitted to the Area E Command in Festac. This enabled her family to trace her body to the morgue and also led them to the hotel.
The police in Lagos delayed the release Cynthia's body to her parents for burial because they had intended to carry out an autopsy on the body at the [[Ikeja General Hospital]] morgue. Police Commissioner Umaru Manko revealed that the pathologist was still working on the autopsy which was  ongoing at the time she was identified. Eventually, her body was released for burial and she was laid to rest in her hometown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/97875-cynthia-osokogu-to-be-buried-sept-7-says-family.html|title=Cynthia Osokogu to be buried Sept. 7, says family|publisher=Premium Times|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ceremonial burial was performed at the family residence in Boji-Boji Owa, Ika North Local Government Area of Delta State after a requiem mass. The Governor of Delta State, Mr. [[Emmanuel Uduaghan]] condoled with the Osokogu family and called on the police to conclude investigation quickly and bring the culprits to book. After Cynthia's murder and investigations progressed through cell phone records and CCTV footages, the police arrested the suspects.

===Crime scene===
Cynthia's body was found naked with her two hands tied behind her back with a brown tape and supported with a padlocked chain; her two legs were also taped together. Her mouth was stuffed with hair net and handkerchief, also tied with brown tape round her head to seal her mouth and secure the materials inside. There were pin-point holes in her white eye as well as inside the upper part of her air ways and surface of her lungs, a condition described as ‘petechial hemorrhage'. The pathologist also revealed that Cynthia had suffered pulmonary Oedema, an overweight of the lungs from being soaked by blood. Her left and right lungs weighed 400 and 500 grams respectively due to blood accumulation”, noting that the normal weight would be 250 to 350 grams. The final autopsy stated that Cynthia was asphyxiated; suffocated to death through blockage of air into her lungs. Apart from her death resulting from [[asphyxia]], the pathologist, John Oladapo Obafunwa also observed that she had multiple bruises and abrasions suspected to be from biting. Her autopsy further revealed that a dose of ‘Rohypnol’ sold to the suspects by a pharmacist, Osita Orji, was not responsible for Cynthia’s death. After the arrest, several other women came forward to reveal that they had also been drugged, tied up and robbed by the suspects, but they all survived to tell the story. According to reports, these two young men also confessed that they had robbed several other women prior to Cynthia who happens to be their sixth victim. The gang reportedly specializes in luring unsuspecting young women, robbing them of their possessions before killing them. Although there were speculations that their motive was ritualistic, it appeared that it was greed and their main goal was to rob and kill. The specific reason Cynthia was killed was not fully established. The police proposed some theories; Perhaps, the suspects became enraged at the lack of payday after spending so much money to get her there. Or, probably, Cynthia struggled or attempted to scream even after being drugged with the sedative Rohypnol. "She was struggling to see how she could liberate herself or make noise in order to attract people to rescue her"; The investigating officer FESTAC Area Commander, Dan Okoro said "But they overpowered her."
The police also stated that it was very likely that the culprits targeted her as they believed she would be carrying large amounts of cash.
She was targeted, because the suspects had figured out that she was the daughter of a retired Army general. They assumed that she would come to Lagos with big cash, a large bank account and jewellery. "At some point they discovered that she came from a very good home and felt that they could make some quick money out of her." But her elder brother, Kenneth stated that Cynthia never carried any large sums of cash and she never even had an ATM card, she used a checkbook,"
Several other men were arrested in connection with the crime including the pharmacists who sold the Rohypnol to the suspected killers without a prescription, their driver who always accompanied them during their robberies and a "fence" -- the man who sold Cynthia's and the other victims goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/135965-cynthia-osokogus-murder-court-views-slide-images-of-autopsy.html|title=Cynthia Osokogu’s murder: Court views slide images of autopsy|date=May 23, 2013|publisher=Premium Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
About one month after Cynthia was laid to rest, the trial commenced  at Yaba Magistrate court, Lagos on August 27, 2012. Six people were arrested at the beginning of the investigation, they included: Olisaeloka Ezike, 23, and Okwuno Nwabufor, 33; both of whom were identified as the Facebook friends.
Others were Osita Orji, the pharmacist who sold Rohypnol to them and Nonso Ezike, Olisaeloka's brother who assisted in selling the deceased’s Blackberry phone. The eight-count charge of conspiracy, murder, armed robbery, rape, “unlawful administration of obnoxious substance” and “forceful administration of obnoxious substance” with a view to causing bodily harm were read to them.&lt;ref name=vanguard/&gt;The trial commenced with the prosecution, the Lagos State Government calling its first witness.
Okwumo Nwabufo and Olisaeloka Ezike were charged with conspiracy to commit murder, and felony. Orji Osita, a pharmacist, was charged with negligently selling the Rohypnol Flunitrazepan tablets to Ezike, the 2nd defendant, without a doctor’s prescription and without showing due care. Nonso Ezike (Nwabufo's younger brother) was charged with being in possession of the three stolen blackberry mobile phones belonging to the late Cynthia Osokogu.
All the accused  initially pleaded not guilty to all six counts. 
Justice Olabisi Akinlade of the Lagos High Court sitting at Igbosere admitted as evidence,  confessional statements of the culprits recorded in a video. When the first defendant was arrested, he confessed that he knew what he did and that everything was over. The first defendant then operated the Blackberry phone to reveal the chain used in tying his victim. The first defendant was arrested on August 20, 2012, after which he made the confessional statement.
The [[Attorney General of Lagos State]], Mr [[Ade Ipaye]], prosecuted the suspected murderer suspects, revealing details of pictures from the crime scene in the court from a laptop. The witness added that he and his team followed the first defendant to his home in Festac and recovered the said laptop, along with some phones and various network SIM cards.
On that same date, the first defendant was asked to open the laptop, which he carried by himself to the Area Commander’s office. Pictures of the deceased lying down and her international passport lying on her chest was revealed,” the witness said
Another prosecution’s witness, testified that from his investigation, it was discovered that the fourth defendant (Nonso) received different stolen phones from the first and second defendant on three occasions. The fourth defendant stole somebody’s receipt in Ladipo Market which he used in selling the deceased’s phone to somebody in Port Harcourt and the person was arrested.
The witness also told the court of another investigation against the defendants, in two separate hotels-Chelsea Suit and Penny Hotel-Festac, where they were alleged to have carried out similar acts. The cases were separated because the incidents did not happen on the same day. It was based on the confessional statement by the first and second defendant that they carried out similar acts in other hotels in Festac.
In one of his appearances in court, Nwabufo denied ever knowing about Rohypnol nor did he put it into Cynthia’s drink. He also claimed that Cynthia was his lover and that they were planning to get married before her death.
Nwabufo, said he met her at Shoprite Mall in [[Lekki]], in 2011 where he went for shopping, while she was also shopping at a fashion shop, dismissing the allegations that they met on Facebook. He also added that when he met her, she was making inquires so he introduced himself to her and she did the same, adding that they exchanged contacts afterwards. He also said that they developed friendship after exchanging addresses and became very close since then. However, there has been no sufficient evidence to warrant this claim. The judge also dismissed the claim by Mr. Nwabufor that Ms. Osokogu was his fiancée and was going to introduce him to her father, saying that the "lover's" story was false because under cross-examination Nwabufor could not tell Cynthia’s birthday, the name of her mother, a home town or in fact anything about her. Though the convicts pleaded not guilty and tried to withdraw the confessional statement they made to the police, claiming they were made under duress, the court admitted the statements they made were corroborated by the testimonies of the witnesses and the evidence provided by the police. The judge said the fact that the police produced a video footage of the convicts making the confessional statement also helped in countering the claim by the convicts that they made the statement under duress.
The court was satisfied that the confessional statements were not [[forced confession|given under duress]] and admitted them in evidence. A confession is sufficient to gain conviction, the judge said.
The confessional statement of the accused is consistent with the state of the body and consistent to the medical evidence. The judge said she would act on it accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Facebook 'stalkers' face trial for model's murder|author= Vladimir Duthiers|date=October 26, 2012|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/25/world/africa/nigeria-facebook-murder-cynthia-osokogu/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ben Ezeamalu|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/119350-how-we-found-out-about-cynthia-osokogus-death-witness.html|title=How we found out about Cynthia Osokogu’s death- witness|publisher=Premium Times|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/07/cynthia-osokogu-court-admits-video-evidence-2/amp/|title=Cynthia Osokogu: Court admits video evidence|date=July 1, 2014|author= ONOZURE DANIA|location=Lagos|publisher=The Vanguard|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.channelstv.com/2014/05/05/prosecution-tenders-obscene-pictures-at-cynthia-osokogus-murder-trial/|title=Prosecution tenders obscene pictures at Cynthia Osokogu’s Murder Trial|publisher=Channels TV|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://saharareporters.com/2012/09/07/lagos-police-seize-corpse-facebook-murder-victim-cynthia-osokogu-pm-news-lagos|title=Lagos Police seize corpse of Facebook murder victim|publisher=Sahara Reporters|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://saharareporters.com/2013/04/12/facebook-murder-victim-cynthia-osokogu-died-“asphyxia”-says-lagos-pathologist|title=Facebook Murder Victim Cynthia Osokogu Died of “Asphyxia,” Says Lagos Pathologist|publisher=Sahara Reporters|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While delivering the judgement, the judge said the accused deserved the sentence as they were not remorseful of their action, and were telling the court lies after offering confessional statements to the police. The judge also found the duo guilty on three other counts and sentenced them to a total of 20 years imprisonment each. They were sentenced to 14 years in jail for conspiracy to commit murder, three years for conspiracy to commit felony by stealing, and three years for stealing a Blackberry phone.
The judge acquitted and discharged Osita and Nonso. While delivering the judgement, Mrs. Akinlade said she relied on the evidence and testimonies provided by the prosecution.
She said having carefully analysed the evidence and testimonies before the court, the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that Messrs. Nwabufor and Ezike murdered Ms. Osokogu.
The judge stated that the evidence of the prosecution remained uncontroverted and relies mainly on the testimonies of witnesses and evidence. It was also very clear that the first defendant was untruthful and deceived the court.
In sentencing both men to [[capital punishment|death by hanging]], the judge said it was no longer relevant to know who, between the two, actually killed Ms. Osokogu.
The second defendant acted in consent with the first defendant and will bear the consequences of their action irrespective of whoever committed the offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Killers of Cynthia Osokogu sentenced to death|date=March 23, 2017 |author=Anthony Ogbonna}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Judge held that with its 10 witnesses and 17 exhibits, the prosecution’s case against Nwabufo and Ezike was uncontroverted and that the circumstantial evidence brought by the state was “cogent, complete, unequivocal and compelling.” The judge held that the circumstantial evidence brought by the state in proof of the six counts of conspiracy, murder and stealing against the accused persons were cogent, complete, unequivocal and compelling. Counsel for Orji and Nonso had requested bail for their clients and Justice Akinlade had granted bail to Orji with two sureties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/97417-how-we-raped-killed-cynthia-suspects-in-murder-of-generals-daughter-confess.html|title=How we raped, killed Cynthia, suspects in murder of General’s daughter confess|author=Victor Enengedi|publisher=Premium Times|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court granted bail to Orji Osita and Ezike Nonso, while the other two who allegedly committed the offence of murder were remanded at the Kirikiri prison, Lagos. For Nonso, Olisaeloka’s younger brother, the judge granted him bail with two sureties, adding that one of the sureties must be a civil servant not less than Grade Level 14 while the other must be a property owner with a genuine Certificate of Occupancy. On March 23, 2017, the Lagos state high court, Igbosere, sentenced Nwabufo and Ezike to death by hanging.

==Aftermath==
Cynthia's murder exposed the dark side of the internet in a way that most people could not imagine. Her mother advised youths to be very cautious of making friends with people that they did not know. She stated “The youths should be very careful, especially when they are making friends in social media. Like we have seen in the case of my daughter, such friends may have ulterior motives."
The police said the incident was a wakeup call to parents to become more vigilant about what their children are involved with while surfing the web. Stricter regulations were proposed for the Federal Government to enforce and restrict the sale of the sedative drug Rohypnol over the counter without the doctor's prescription in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bellanaija.com/2012/10/fg-set-to-ban-date-molestation-drug-rohypnol-drug-used-to-sedate-cynthia-osokogu-before-she-was-murdered/|date=October 26, 2012|title=FG Set to Ban “Date Rape” Drug Rohypnol – Drug used to Sedate Cynthia Osokogu before she was Murdered|author=Adeola Adeyemo|publisher=Bella Naija|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge's final verdict lifted the hopes of some who had lost interest in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thenet.ng/2013/02/cynthia-osokogu-murder-suspects-plead-guilty/|publisher=Nigerian Entertainment Today|title=Cynthia Okosogu's Murder: Suspects plead guilty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/03/breaking-killers-cynthia-osokogu-sentenced-death/|title=Breaking: Killers of Cynthia Osokogu sentenced to death|publisher=The Vanguard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/226985-killers-cynthia-osokogu-sentenced-death.html|title=Killers of Cynthia Osokogu sentenced to death|author=Nicholas Ibekwe|publisher=Premium Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/03/5-years-2-die-cynthia-osokogus-killing/|title=5 years after: 2 to die over Cynthia Osokogu’s killing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=0X5fDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=cynthia+osokogu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmg8ipjc_XAhXN0RoKHTtDBgMQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cynthia%20osokogu&amp;f=false|title=Contextualizing Africans and Globalization: Expressions in Sociopolitical and Religious Contents and Discontents|author1=Ibigbolade S.

'''Open Access Week''' is an annual [[scholarly communication]] event focusing on [[open access]] and related topics. It takes place globally during the last full week of October in a multitude of locations both on- and offline. Typical activities include talks, seminars, symposia, or the announcement of [[open access mandate]]s or other milestones in open access. For instance, the [[Royal Society]] chose Open Access Week 2011 to announce that they would release the digitized backfiles of their archives, dating from 1665 to 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Society journal archive made permanently free to access |url= http://royalsociety.org/news/Royal-Society-journal-archive-made-permanently-free-to-access/ |work=The Royal Society |accessdate=25 September 2013|date=26 October 2011}} ([https://www.webcitation.org/62kQQYHZh WebCite])&lt;/ref&gt;

Open Access Week has its roots in the ''National Day of Action for Open Access'' on February 15, 2007, organized across the United States by [[Students for Free Culture]] and the [[Alliance for Taxpayer Access]].&lt;ref name=SfFC2007&gt;[http://freeculture.org/blog/2007/02/02/announcing-the-national-day-of-action-for-open-access-feb-15/ Announcing the National Day of Action for Open Access: Feb. 15] ([https://www.webcitation.org/6ECsHUw0W WebCite])&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51052">'''Philosophy, politics and economics''' ('''PPE''') is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[undergraduate]]/[[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] [[academic degree|degree]] which combines study from three disciplines.

The first institution to offer degrees in PPE was the [[University of Oxford]] in the 1920s. This particular course has produced a [[List of University of Oxford people with PPE degrees|significant number of notable graduates]] such as [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], Burmese politician, State Counsellor of Myanmar, Nobel Peace Prize winner; [[Christopher Hitchens]], the British–American author, [[polemic]]ist, [[debate]]r, and journalist;&lt;ref name="ukwhoswho1"&gt;'Hitchens, Christopher Eric', ''Who's Who''; 2012, A &amp; C Black, 2012; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2012 ; online edn, January 2012 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U20283, accessed 5 December 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsvq4PYdt40&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=23m55s|title=Christopher Hitchens - On C-SPAN discussing his book 'For the Sake of Argument' [1993]|publisher=C-SPAN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippa Foot]] a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Harold Wilson]], [[Edward Heath]] and [[David Cameron]], former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]; [[Hugh Gaitskell]] and [[Ed Miliband]], former [[Leader of the Opposition|Leaders of the Opposition]]; [[William Hague]], the former Leader of the Opposition and former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] [[Benazir Bhutto]],  [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] [[Imran Khan]], and [[Malcolm Fraser]], [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Tony Abbott]], former [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Ministers of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kenny|first=Mark|title=Tony Abbott's Oxford transcript released|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/tony-abbotts-oxford-transcript-released-20131125-2y6a1.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=graun&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/23/ppe-oxford-university-degree-that-rules-britain |title=PPE: the Oxford degree that runs Britain |last=Beckett |first=Andy|author-link=Andy Beckett|date=23 February 2017|website=[[theguardian.com]] |access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course received fresh attention in 2017, when Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Malala Yousafzai]] earned a place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=A level results: Malala Yousafzai gets a place at Oxford|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-40959543|accessdate=17 August 2017|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Malala Yousafzai gets into Oxford to study PPE after collecting A Level results|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/08/17/malala-yousafzai-gets-oxford-study-ppe/|accessdate=18 August 2017|work=Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the [[University of York]] went on to establish its own PPE degree based upon the Oxford model; [[King's College London]], the [[University of Warwick]], the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]], and other British universities later followed.  According to the [[BBC]], the Oxford PPE "dominate[s] public life" (in the UK).&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11136511 |title=Why does PPE rule Britain? | last1=Kelly | first1=Jon |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-08-31 |accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now offered at several other leading colleges and universities around the world.

== History ==
Philosophy, Politics and Economics was established as a degree course at the University of Oxford in the 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/applying/ugcourses/index.asp#_Toc146507694] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830181845/http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/applying/ugcourses/index.asp|date=2009-08-30}} "Balliol was the birthplace of the modern degree of PPE in the 1920s. A. D. Lindsay, who subsequently became the master of the college, played a key role in the establishment of the degree and Balliol has long remained a major college for the study of PPE, and PPE has long been a major subject within Balliol."&lt;/ref&gt; as a modern alternative to [[classics]] (known as "[[literae humaniores]]" or "greats" at Oxford) because it was thought as a more modern alternative for those entering the [[civil service]]. It was thus initially known as "modern greats".&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/the_faculty/history_of_philosophy |title=History of Philosophy at Oxford – Faculty of Philosophy |publisher=Philosophy.ox.ac.uk |date=2009-11-19 |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first PPE students commenced their course in the autumn of 1921.&lt;ref name=graun /&gt; The regulation by which it was established is Statt. Tit. VI. Sect. 1 C; "the subject of the Honour School of Philosophy, Politics, and Economics shall be the study of the structure, and the philosophical and economic principles, of Modern Society."&lt;ref&gt;University of Oxford (1926) ''The Examination Statutes. together with the regulations of the boards of studies and boards of faculties for the academical year 1926-1927''. Oxford: Clarendon Press; pp. 149=54&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was compulsory to study all three subjects for all three years of the course, but in 1970 this requirement was relaxed, and since then students have been able to drop one subject after the first year – most do this, but a minority continue with all three.&lt;ref name=graun /&gt;

During the 1960s some students started to critique the course from a left-wing perspective, culminating in the publication of a pamphlet, ''The Poverty of PPE'', in 1968, written by Trevor Pateman, who argued that it "gives no training in scholarship, only refining to a high degree of perfection the ability to write short dilettantish essays on the basis of very little knowledge: ideal training for the social engineer". The pamphlet advocated incorporating the study of sociology, anthropology and art, and to take on the aim of "assist(ing) the radicalisation and mobilisation of political opinion outside the university". In response, some minor changes were made, with influential leftist writers such as [[Frantz Fanon]] and [[Régis Debray]] being added to politics reading lists, but the core of the programme remained the same.&lt;ref name=graun /&gt;

Christopher Stray has pointed to the course as one reason for the gradual decline of the study of classics, as classicists in political life began to be edged out by those who had studied the modern greats.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Stray, ''Classics Transformed: Schools, Universities, and Society in England, 1830–1960''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998. Pp. xiv, 336. {{ISBN|0-19-815013-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dario Castiglione and Iain Hampsher-Monk have described the course as being fundamental to the development of political thought in the UK, since it established a connection between politics and philosophy. Previously at Oxford, and for some time subsequently at Cambridge, politics had been taught only as a branch of modern history.&lt;ref&gt;Dario Castiglione and Iain Hampsher-Monk, ''The History of Political Thought in National Context''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-521-78234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Course material ==
The programme is rooted in the view that to understand social phenomena one must approach them from several complementary disciplinary directions and analytical frameworks. In this regard, the study of [[philosophy]] is considered important because it both equips students with [[meta-tools]] such as the ability to [[reason]] rigorously and [[logic]]ally, and facilitates [[ethical]] reflection. The study of [[politics]] is considered necessary because it acquaints students with the institutions that govern society and help solve [[collective action]] problems. Finally, studying [[economics]] is seen as vital in the modern world because political decisions often concern economic matters, and government decisions are often influenced by economic events. The vast majority of students at Oxford drop one of the three subjects for the second and third years of their course. Oxford now has more than 600 undergraduates studying the subject, admitting over 200 each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppe.ox.ac.uk/index.php/why-study-ppe-at-oxford|title=Why Study PPE at Oxford?|work=ox.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic opinions ==
Oxford PPE graduate [[Nick Cohen]] and former tutor Iain McLean consider the course's breadth important to its appeal, especially "because British society values generalists over specialists". Academic and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peer]] [[Maurice Glasman, Baron Glasman|Maurice Glasman]] noted that "PPE combines the status of an elite university degree – PPE is the ultimate form of being good at school – with the stamp of a vocational course. It is perfect training for cabinet membership, and it gives you a view of life". However he also noted that it had an orientation towards consensus politics and [[technocracy]].&lt;ref name=graun /&gt;

[[Geoff Evans (political scientist)|Geoffrey Evans]], an Oxford fellow in politics and a senior tutor, critiques that the Oxford course's success and consequent over-demand is a self-perpetuating feature of those in front of and behind the scenes in national administration, in stating "all in all, it's how the class system works". In the current economic system he bemoans the unavoidable inequalities besetting admissions and thereby enviable recruitment prospects of successful graduates. The argument itself intended as a [[paternalism|paternalistic]] ethical reflection on how governments and peoples can perpetuate [[social stratification]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

[[Stewart Wood, Baron Wood of Anfield|Stewart Wood]], a former adviser to [[Ed Miliband]] who studied PPE at Oxford in the 1980s and taught politics there in the 1990s and 2000s, acknowledged that the programme has been slow to catch up with contemporary political developments, saying that "it does still feel like a course for people who are going to run the Raj in 1936... In the politics part of PPE, you can go three years without discussing a single contemporary public policy issue". He also stated that the structure of the course gave it a [[centrist]] bias, due to the range of material covered: "...most students think, mistakenly, that the only way to do it justice is to take a centre position".&lt;ref name=graun /&gt;

== History ==
== History ==
The Polytechnic University of Tirana is the oldest and the second largest university in Albania, after the [[University of Tirana]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} It was founded in 1951 and now has approximately 10,000 students, who come from [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], and [[Montenegro]]. In 2012, at the occasion of the [[100th Anniversary of the Independence of Albania]], UPT was awarded a high honor badge by the [[President of Albania]], [[Bujar Nishani]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upt.al/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=200%3Akonferenca-universiteti-politeknik-i-tiranes-ne-100-vjetorin-e-pavaresise&amp;catid=67%3Amenu-kryesore&amp;lang=en Conference: "UPT at the 100th Anniversary of Independence]&lt;/ref&gt;  The university is fully accredited by the [[Albanian Public Agency for Accreditation of Higher Education]] (APAAHE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaal.edu.al/pagesEN/indexEN.htm APAAHE Official Website (English)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==

The university includes six [[college]]s and two [[research institute]]s:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upt.al/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=2&amp;lang=sq Fakultete dhe Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531153805/http://www.upt.al/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=2&amp;lang=sq |date=2011-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Faculty of Mechanical Engineering
*Faculty of Geology and Mining
*Faculty of Electrical Engineering
*Faculty of Mathematics and Physics
*Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism
*Geosciences Institute
*Institute of Energy, Water and Environment

PUT emphasizes teaching over research. It issues three-year [[Bachelor degrees]], two-year [[Master degrees]], and three- to five-year [[doctoral degree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upt.al/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=2&amp;lang=en Faculties and programs at UPT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021185234/http://www.upt.al/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=2&amp;lang=en |date=2013-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic programs are compatible with the [[Bologna system]]. The language of instruction is [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and, for special and/or exchange courses, [[English language|English]].

Among the PUT departments, the Department of Architecture and Urban Planning (DAUP), included within the Faculty of Civil Engineering is particularly competitive. It accepts about 120 students each year, out of a candidate pool sometimes as large as 360. DAUP is the largest department of architecture and urban planning in Albania and employs 35 [[full-time]] tenure-track professors, 40 [[adjunct professor]]s, and 16 guest professors. It offers integrated five-year programs (Bachelor + Master) in [[architecture]] and [[urban planning]]. In the architecture program, the education of students in [[structural engineering]] and [[building technology]] are major focuses of the curriculum. In the urban planning program, urban design and landscape architecture are in focus. In addition to the integrated diplomas, DAUP offers a 3-5 year [[Ph.D.]]/[[Doctorate]] program, which includes three profiles (1) Architecture Design (2) [[Urban Planning]] and (3) [[Historic Preservation]] and [[Conservation-restoration|Restoration]].

'''''S. A. Agulhas''''' is a South African [[icebreaker|ice-strengthened]] training ship and former polar [[research vessel]]. She was built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in [[Shimonoseki]], Japan, in 1978. ''S. A. Agulhas'' was used to service the three [[South African National Antarctic Programme]] research bases, [[Gough Island]], [[Marion Island]] in the Southern Ocean and [[SANAE IV]] in [[Antarctica]], as well as various research voyages.

''S. A. Agulhas'' retired from Antarctic service in April 2012 when the replacement vessel, ''[[S. A. Agulhas II]]'', was commissioned. She was transferred to the South African Maritime Safety Authority as a training ship.&lt;ref name="bd-retire"&gt;{{cite news|last=Van Zyl|first=Roux|title=Polar Stalwart SA Agulhas Retiring|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200911180709.html|accessdate=4 October 2010|newspaper=[[Business Day (South Africa)|Business Day]]|date=18 November 2009|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fallafrica.com%2Fstories%2F200911180709.html&amp;date=2011-10-12|archivedate=12 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ramona"&gt;[http://www.radioramona.fi/index.php?mw=&amp;option=com_sbsarticle&amp;tmpl=blog&amp;cid=30664&amp;cat=1 Antarktisen tutkimus- ja huoltoalus kastetiin ja laskettiin vesille Raumalla].

==History==

===Rudder damage===
In December 1991, ''S. A. Agulhas'' suffered rudder damage while in the Antarctic. The German icebreaker ''[[RV Polarstern|Polarstern]]'' assisted her and by February 1992 ''S. A. Agulhas'' had been freed from the pack ice. Once freed, the [[SAS Drakensberg (A301)|SAS ''Drakensberg'']] towed the stricken vessel back to Cape Town for repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S A AGULHAS|url=http://www.shipstamps.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=9569&amp;start=0|accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SA Navy in the regional context|url=http://www.navy.mil.za/aboutus/role/page2.htm|publisher=[[South African Navy]]|accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beskadigde SA Agulhas Saterdag in Kaap verwag|url=http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/1992/02/19/9/10.html|accessdate=5 October 2010|newspaper=[[Beeld]]|date=19 February 1992|language=Afrikaans|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703113635/http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/1992/02/19/9/10.html|archivedate=3 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rescue of the ''Magdalena Oldendorff''===
''S. A. Agulhas'' participated in a multinational rescue of ''[[Magdalena Oldendorff]]'' in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2064862.stm| title=Icebreaker joins Antarctic rescue | publisher=BBC News| date=25 June 2002| accessdate=2008-06-17| quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ice-strengthened cargo ship had become stuck in the ice during severe weather conditions while en route from a Russian Antarctic base to Cape Town. ''S. A. Agulhas'' and the [[Argentine]] icebreaker ''[[ARA Almirante Irízar (Q-5)|Almirante Irízar]]'' were dispatched to render assistance. On 27 June 2002, ''S. A. Agulhas'' was {{convert|370|km}} from ''Magdalena Oldendorff'', close enough for its two [[Atlas Oryx|Oryx helicopters]], operated by [[22 Squadron SAAF|22 Squadron]],&lt;ref name="sainfo-rescue"/&gt; to reach the stricken vessel. By 1 June the Oryx had transferred 89 Russian Antarctic expedition members and ''Magdalena Oldendorff'' crew members&lt;ref name="sainfo-rescue"&gt;{{cite web|title=SA pulls off Antarctic rescue|url=http://www.southafrica.info/news/agulhas.htm|publisher=South African Government|accessdate=4 October 2010|date=3 July 2002|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tEWFBEv0?url=http://www.southafrica.info/news/agulhas.htm|archivedate=4 October 2010|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ''S. A. Agulhas'' and have transferred {{convert|2000|kg}} of supplies to the remaining crew. The crew remaining on ''Magdalena Oldendorff'' were to await the arrival of ''Almirante Irizar'' and attempt to free the ship.&lt;ref name="macron"&gt;{{cite web|title=Antarctic International Rescue – Jul 2002|url=http://www.marcon.com/marcon2c.cfm?SectionListsID=85&amp;PageID=241|publisher=marcon International|accessdate=4 October 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tESoTxfE?url=http://www.marcon.com/marcon2c.cfm?SectionListsID=85&amp;PageID=241|archivedate=4 October 2010|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deaths at sea===
[[file:SA Agulhas with bull kelp and penguin.jpg|thumb|SA Agulhas in 2007 with seal, [[King Penguin|penguin]] and [[Durvillaea antarctica|kelp]] off Marion Island]]
On 27 September 2007, Ordinary Seaman Edward Hudley was stabbed and killed while ''S. A. Agulhas'' was near [[Gough Island]]. Two crew members were accused of murder.&lt;ref name=Iol2007-10-10&gt;

Both accused were charged with murder on arrival in Cape Town, but all charges were dropped on 6 April 2009.&lt;ref name="tcw-emergency"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergency Aboard SA Agulhas|url=http://www.tristandc.com/newsagulhasemergency.php|publisher=The Tristan da Cunha Website|accessdate=4 October 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tEPgzKMw?url=http://www.tristandc.com/newsagulhasemergency.php|archivedate=4 October 2010|year=2007|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the ship's first ever voyage to Marion Island, a member of the crew was killed by another crew member, using a fire axe. On arrival back in Cape Town, the suspected killer could not be found on board the vessel. It was speculated that he jumped over the side of the vessel before arrival in Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;http://alp.lib.sun.ac.za/bitstream/handle/123456789/2155/leith%20_bill_transcript.pdf?sequence=5&amp;isAllowed=y&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Mission==

The mission of ''S. A. Agulhas'' included regular visits to South Africa's base on [[Antarctica]], and to research stations on [[Gough Island]] and [[Marion Island]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Retirement from polar mission and new role==

''S. A. Agulhas'' retired from polar supply missions in March 2012, when its replacement, ''S. A. Agulhas II'', arrived.&lt;ref name="bd-retire"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ramona"/&gt;
The Oceans and Coasts Branch of the
[[Department of Environmental Affairs (South Africa)|Department of Environmental Affairs]] announced in 2011 that several other government agencies had requested the vessel's transfer, noting that, unlike the new vessel, the first was not designed to carry out scientific research, just icebreaking and that the capability to perform scientific research had been added later. It was also reported that the vessel could be insured for a further two years.&lt;ref name=EngineeringNews2011-09-30/&gt;

In July 2012 the ''S. A. Agulhas'' was recommissioned as a training ship operated by the [[South African Maritime Safety Authority]], the ship will continue to provide facilities for scientific research while training up to seventy [[Sailor|merchant marine]] cadets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=26602:sa-agulhas-now-a-training-vessel&amp;catid=51:Sea&amp;Itemid=106 |title=SA Agulhas now a training vessel |publisher=DefenceWeb |date=5 July 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having undertaken a brief "shakedown" cruise from 4 July 2012, the ship left Cape Town on 2 November 2012 on the first full cruise as a training vessel. Included in the itinerary were visits to [[Tema]] and [[Abidjan]] to take on additional cadets from Cameroon, Gambia, Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire, while en route to London, UK. After return to Cape Town, the ship will then visit Antarctica. During the cruise various scientific experiments and observations will be done for the [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] and the Departments of [[Department of Science and Technology (South Africa)|Science and Technology]] and [[Department of Environmental Affairs|Environmental Affairs]]. In addition the vessel will deliver the Antarctica winter crossing expedition led by Sir [[Ranulph Fiennes]] in support of the charity [[Seeing is Believing (organization)|"Seeing is Believing”]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=26934:agulhas-1-headed-for-london&amp;catid=51:Sea&amp;Itemid=106 |title="Agulhas 1" headed for London |publisher=DefenceWeb |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.link2media.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18146&amp;Itemid=12 |title=Address at the Send Off of the Agulhas Vessel by Ms. Sindisiwe |publisher=link2media |date=2 November 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130421205750/http://www.link2media.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18146&amp;Itemid=12 |archivedate=21 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3595">The '''SAT Subject Test in Biology''' is the name of a one-hour [[multiple choice]] [[Standardized test|test]] given on [[biology]] by The [[College Board]]. A [[student]] chooses whether to take the test depending upon [[college]] entrance requirements for the schools in which the student is planning to apply. Until 1994, the SAT Subject Tests were known as Achievement Tests; and from 1995 until January 2005, they were known as SAT IIs. Of all [[SAT Subject Tests|SAT subject tests]], the Biology E/M test is the only SAT II that allows the test taker a choice between the [[Ecology|ecological]] or [[Molecular biology|molecular]] tests. A set of 60 questions is taken by all test takers for Biology and a choice of 20 questions is allowed between either the E or M tests. This test is graded on a scale between 200 and 800. The average for Molecular is 630 while Ecological is 591.&lt;ref name=SATsubjectpercentile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/highered/ra/sat/SubjTestPercentileRanks.pdf |title=SAT Subject Test Percentile Ranks |accessdate=July 28, 2008 |format=[[PDF]] |publisher=[[The College Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
This test has 80 multiple-choice questions that are to be answered in one hour. All questions have five answer choices. Students receive one point for each correct answer, lose ¼ of a point for each incorrect answer, and receive 0 points for questions left blank.&lt;ref name=SATHowtheTestIsScored&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/sat/scores/understanding/howscored.html |title=SAT How the Test Is Scored |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |publisher=[[The College Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student's score is based entirely on his or her performance in answering the multiple-choice questions.

The questions cover a broad range of topics in general biology. There are more specific questions related respectively on ecological concepts (such as population studies and general [[Ecology]]) on the E test and molecular concepts such as [[DNA]] structure, [[translation (genetics)|translation]], and biochemistry on the M test.&lt;ref name=SATsubjecttestinbiology&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/sat/lc_two/bio/bio.html?bio |title=SAT Subject Test in Biology |accessdate=August 27, 2009 |publisher=[[The College Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
The College Board suggests a year-long course in [[biology]] at the college preparatory level, as well as a one-year course in [[algebra]], and [[laboratory|lab]] experience as preparation for the test. The test requires understanding of biological data and concepts, science-related terms, and the ability to effectively synthesize and interpret data from charts, maps, and other [[visual media]].&lt;ref name=SATsubjecttestinbiology&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/sat/lc_two/bio/bio.html?bio|title=SAT Subject Test in Biology |accessdate=November 22, 2013 |publisher=[[The College Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most questions from this test are derived from, or are similar to, the pre-2012 [[AP Biology]] multiple choice questions.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} By taking an [[Advanced Placement|AP class]] or a class with similar rigor, one's chances at doing well on this test should improve.

Since 2008, the focus of the foundation has been its Free Education Initiative which has led to the creation of 241 courses representing 10 of the highest enrollment majors in the US.&lt;ref name="Moodle241" /&gt;

The Saylor Academy's emphasis is assembling courses from openly available texts and resources.&lt;ref name="Saylor as Savior" /&gt; The foundation also funds the creation of new materials when needed, which is then openly licensed for use by other organizations and individuals. In March 2018 Edovo partnered with  Saylor Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.elearninginside.com/edovo-brings-elearning-to-u-s-prison-system/|title=Edovo, a tablet-based solution, brings eLearning to prisons.|date=2018-03-01|work=eLearningInside News|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Courses==
On its website, the foundation offers 317 free, college-level courses, which are selected as typical courses in high enrollment majors at traditional U.S. colleges.&lt;ref name="WAPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/online-course-startups-offer-virtually-free-college/2012/01/09/gIQAEJ6VGQ_story.html|title=Online course start-ups offer virtually free college|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2012-12-21|accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Content is accessible without needing to register or log into the website, however an account is required to gain access to final exams, and a free certificate of completion.&lt;ref name="Moodle241" /&gt;

The foundation works with consultants to design the courses, typically university and college faculty members or subject experts.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The consultant develops a blueprint for the course, then researches [[open educational resources]] (OER) to supply the course with lectures, texts, and other resources. If suitable texts and documents are not found, the foundation works with faculty to compile new materials which it releases to the OER community under a [[Creative Commons]] license.&lt;ref name="Saylor Foundation to Launch Multi-Million Dollar Open Textbook Challenge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collegeopentextbooks.org/blog/2011/08/09/saylor-foundation-to-launch-multi-million-dollar-open-textbook-challenge/ |title=Saylor Foundation to Launch Multi-Million Dollar Open Textbook Challenge! &amp;#124; College Open Textbooks Blog |publisher=Collegeopentextbooks.org |date=2011-08-09 |accessdate=2011-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104235827/http://collegeopentextbooks.org/blog/2011/08/09/saylor-foundation-to-launch-multi-million-dollar-open-textbook-challenge/ |archivedate=2011-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each course is accompanied by an assessment.&lt;ref name=Moodle241&gt;{{cite web|last=Thibault|first=Joseph|title=241 OER Courses with Assessments in Moodle: How Saylor.org has created one of the largest Free and Open Course Initiatives on the web|url=http://www.moodlenews.com/2012/250-oer-courses-and-assessments-in-moodle-how-saylor-org-has-created-one-of-the-largest-open-course-initiatives-on-the-web/|publisher=Moodlenews.com|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation and credentialing==
The Saylor Academy is not accredited within any traditional system, but they have been featured{{by whom?|date=March 2018}} as a candidate for launching a system of alternative accreditation through the use of [[badge]]s.&lt;ref name="WAPost" /&gt; The foundation has stated its intentions to tap into the soon to be released [[Open Badge Infrastructure]] from the [[Mozilla Foundation]].{{cn|date=March 2018}} This project by the Mozilla Foundation, in tandem with the [[HASTAC]] organization, will allow website operators to issue and display badges within a single inter-operable and [[open source]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges Mozilla Open Badges Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''State v. Stone''' is a popular [[Mock Trial|mock trial]] case published by the [[National Institute for Trial Advocacy]].  Set in the fictional town of "Nita City", the case is about a man named James Stone who is charged with the [[rape]] of a 21-year-old college student named Marilyn Miller.

== Facts of the Case ==

On a December afternoon in Nita City, the police receive a call from a 21-year-old college student named Marilyn Miller, who explains that a man broke into her apartment and raped her.  Miller is taken in for medical treatment, which confirms forcible rape, and on the ride back to her apartment she tells the police officer that she remembers seeing her attacker before.  Miller explains that the previous night, she was at a bar called "Rocco's" where she had an encounter with a twenty-something male who grabbed her hand and said "you need some loving."  She tells the officer that this man was the one who attacked her.

Police find a small blue book in Marilyn Miller's apartment, which they trace to a 28-year-old man with a criminal record named James Stone.  The book was a notebook used and carried around by Stone.  Stone is subsequently arrested; at his residence, police find clothing matching Miller's description of what the attacker wore.  The police show Miss Miller a series of photographs, one of which is Stone's, asking if she can identify her attacker.  Miller states that she thinks the photograph of Stone is her attacker, but wants to see him in person to be sure.  A police officer then takes her to James Stone's arraignment, where he is escorted before the judge in the courtroom.  Upon seeing James Stone, Marilyn Miller confirms that he was the one who attacked her.

James Stone admits that he was the one said "you need some loving" to Marilyn Miller at Rocco's the previous night, but he denies that he raped her, and insists that he lost his blue book at the bar.  James Stone's friends, Thomas Mitchell and Edward Lindsay, testify for him as alibi witnesses, saying that they were with Stone at the Nita University cafeteria around the time the attack took place.  James Stone also insists that he is happily married, though some evidence suggests that he was unhappy in his relationship with his wife...and that he had a rather strong sexual desire.

=== Important facts tending to incriminate James Stone ===

* Marilyn Miller identified Stone as her attacker.
* Stone's blue notebook was found at Miller's apartment.
* Stone had clothing matching the description of the attacker given by Miller, including a red bandana that Miller said her attacker wore over his face.
* Stone has a criminal record.

=== Common defenses to these ===

* Marilyn Miller didn't identify Stone as her attacker until the ride back to her apartment, which was after she had been given medication.
* Stone claims he lost the blue book at Rocco's and that she must have taken it home with her.  A waitress from Rocco's testifies that she saw James Stone and his friends searching for something at the end of the night.  However, they never told her at the time what they were searching for.
* The clothing worn by the attacker was not particularly uncommon for a person to have.
* Stone's past criminal record involves a burglary and an incident where he drove the getaway car in an armed robbery; nothing on the order of rape.

== Witnesses ==

There are a total of ten witness characters in the case.

=== Witnesses for the State ===

'''Marilyn Miller.'''  The woman who accuses James Stone of raping her.

'''Detective Wasilewski.'''  The detective who led the investigation of the rape.

'''Dr. Madden.'''  The OB/GYN who treated Marilyn Miller.

'''Diana Samuels.'''  A woman with whom James Stone was having an affair.  Her note to her therapist suggests that Stone had very strong sexual urges.

'''Officer Pace.'''  The police officer who responded to the rape call.

=== Witnesses for the Defense ===

'''James Stone.'''  The defendant.

'''Florence Stone.'''  James Stone's wife, who defends his good and moral character.

'''Edward Lindsey.'''  A friend of Stones, who claims he was with him around the time of the rape.

'''Thomas Mitchell.'''  Another friend of stones who also claims to have been with him around the time of the rape.

'''Esther Boothe.'''  A waitress who testifies that she saw James Stone and his friends searching for something before they left Rocco's on the night before the rape.

== Aspects of the Case ==

Like most cases designed for mock trials, ''State v. Stone'' has many nuances.

=== Character of James Stone ===

James Stone is designed to be a "scum of the earth" type of character, a man with a multiple felony convictions who is cheating on his wife, and who would accost a young girl in a bar and tell her "you need some loving."  Indeed, his very name "Stone" seems to be something of a character pun, much like his counterpart "John Diamond", the umblemished police officer and former Marine who is the defendant in the NITA case ''State v. Diamond.''  An important part of the defense's case is the rehabilitation of Stone's character, or alternatively, keeping this out of the case.

=== The Blue Book ===

There is no dispute that the blue notebook belonging to James Stone was found inside Marilyn Miller's apartment.  According to the prosecution's theory of the case, Stone accidentally dropped it there when he raped Miller.

The defense is thus shouldered with offering an alternate explanation for how the book ended up in Miller's apartment.  A popular argument is that she somehow accidentally took it home with her from Rocco's the previous night; perhaps it was dropped in her purse when Stone accosted her, or that she took it back thinking it was hers, and forgot after being given medication after her rape.

=== Marilyn Miller's Apartment ===

An important hole for the prosecution to fill is how James Stone found Marilyn Miller's apartment.  Miller lived in a multiple-dwelling residence, with doors leading to two different apartments inside of a main door (one upstairs, one downstairs).  Miller testified that she heard a crash and that the next thing she knew, her rapist was standing in the doorway.  Her rapist thus must have known which apartment inside the building was hers.

One theory might be that James Stone followed Miller home, and after she entered her apartment building, saw her turn on the light  through the window - indicating that Marilyn lived in the upstairs apartment in the building.

=== Witness Credibility versus Alibi Strength ===

Thomas Mitchell and Edward Lindsey both testify that they were with James Stone at a cafeteria around noon on the day of the rape.  The victim call and reported the rape at 12:45&amp;nbsp;p.m., meaning that Mitchell's testimony still leaves time, albeit not much, for James Stone to have potentially committed the rape.

Both sides have something of a dilemma with Mitchell and Lindsey because, on one hand, if their testimony still leaves room for Stone to commit the crime, then this makes their testimony more reliable.  If Thomas Mitchell and Edward Lindsey were lying to protect Stone and give him an alibi, then logically, they would alibi him for the entire time period.  The fact that their testimony doesn't completely exonerate Stone suggests that Mitchell and Lindsey are telling the truth.  On the other hand, if their alibi is imperfect, then it still leaves room for the crime to be committed.

Both sides should ideally argue for their version of the facts under both potential sets of facts.  In other words, the prosecution should ideally argue that, either Mitchell and Lindsey are being untruthful - meaning that their testimony doesn't exonerate Stone - or that they are being truthful, but the alibi they present is imperfect.

=== DNA Evidence ===

''State v. Stone'' was written before [[DNA]] was widely used as evidence, and there is no discussion of any attempt to recover genetic material from the victim in the original publication.  Some courses and competitions may add the fact that no material containing DNA was discovered or that the case should be considered as though genetic testing has not yet been developed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7529">The '''University of Chicago Graduate Library School''' (GLS) was established in 1928 to develop a program for the graduate education of [[librarian]]s with a focus on research.&lt;ref&gt;Association of American Library Schools. ''New Frontiers in Librarianship; Proceedings of the Special Meeting of the Association of American Library Schools and the Board of Education for Librarianship of the American Library Association in Honor of the University of Chicago and the Graduate Library School, December 30, 1940.'' [Chicago]: The Graduate library school, the University of Chicago, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;  Housed for a time in the Joseph [[Regenstein Library]], the GLS closed in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;"Chicago GLS to close." ''Library Journal'' 114, (February 15, 1989): 111.&lt;/ref&gt; GLS faculty were among the most prominent researchers in librarianship in the twentieth century.  Alumni of the school have made a great impact on the profession including [[Tsuen-hsuin Tsien]], [[Benjamin E. Powell]], [[Charlemae Hill Rollins]], [[Peggy Sullivan]] and [[Hugh Atkinson (librarian)|Hugh Atkinson]].In February 2016, [[Carla Hayden]] (PhD, 1987) was nominated by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama|Obama]] to serve as [[Librarian of Congress]].  She was confirmed in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;McGlone, Peggy, "Carla Hayden confirmed as 14th librarian of Congress," ''Washington Post'' July 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Early in the 20th century, the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] began offering grants to change the direction of library education and scholarship. Of particular interest was the creation of an institution analogous to the [[Harvard Law School]] or the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]].  The result was a sensation: the 1926 endowment of a research-oriented program offering only the [[Ph.D. degree]],&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael. "Documentation, Information Science and Library Science in the USA." ''Information Processing and Management'' 32, no. 1 (1996): 63-76.&lt;/ref&gt; With an emphasis on investigation fostered among students, studies conducted and conferences held at GLS provided a center for intellectual inquiry in the development of 20th century [[library science|librarianship]].  ''[[The Library Quarterly]]'', a scholarly journal focused on research, was launched in 1931 to provide an outlet for the publication of rigorous research.

==Structure and focus==

The Graduate Library School (GLS) at the [[University of Chicago]] changed the structure and focus of education for librarianship in the twentieth century. Funded by the Carnegie Corporation &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = F. P. Keppel | title = The Carnegie Corporation and the Graduate Library School: A Historical Outline | journal = The Library Quarterly | year = 1931 | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–25 | jstor = 40039626 | doi=10.1086/612840}}&lt;/ref&gt; the GLS set forth policies to establish an institution to educate students imbued with the spirit of investigation. Prior to establishment of the GLS education for librarians had been an apprenticeship model.&lt;ref&gt;Shera, Jesse Hauk. 1972. The foundations of education for librarianship. New York: Becker and Hayes.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Waples wrote of the policies that would differentiate  “The Graduate Library School at Chicago” from schools in the apprenticeship mode.

John V. Richardson, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, J.V. (1982). ''The Spirit of Inquiry: The Graduate Library School at Chicago'', 1921-
51. Chicago: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt; has written of the establishment and the first 30 years of the GLS in ''The Spirit of Inquiry: The Graduate Library School at Chicago, 1921–51.''

Joyce M. Latham has written of the role of GLS faculty in the development of the Chicago Public Library noting "In their final report on the status of CPL, ''A Metropolitan Library in Action'', [[Carleton B. Joeckel]] and [[Leon Carnovsky]] devoted significant attention to the role
of the public library in adult education." &lt;ref&gt;Latham, J. M. (2011). Memorial Day to Memorial Library: The South Chicago Branch Library as cultural terrain, 1937–1947. Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record, 46(3), 321–342.&lt;/ref&gt;

The faculty of the GLS were innovators in the use of computers for library functions. In 1982 Don Swanson described the Microsystem for Interactive Bibliographic Searching (MIRABILIS) for the general library community in ''Library Journal'' &lt;ref&gt;Swanson, Don R. 1982. "Miracles, Microcomputers, and Librarians". ''Library Journal.'' 107, no. 11: 1055-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculty==
Faculty who taught at the GLS included many scholars who conducted foundational research in librarianship including [[Lester Asheim]], Abraham Bookstein,&lt;ref&gt;"Congestion at Card and Book Catalogs: A Queuing-Theory Approach.

===''The Library Quarterly''===

The faculty of the Graduate Library School established the journal, ''[[The Library Quarterly]]'' in 1931. The work of the GLS faculty to establish a scholarly journal focused on research has been carefully detailed by Steve Norman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Steve Norman | year = 1988 | title = ''The Library Quarterly'' in the 1930s: a journal of discussion's early years  | journal = The Library Quarterly | volume = 58 | pages = 327–351 | jstor = 4308292 | doi=10.1086/602047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7631">'''Virtual Math Teams''' ('''VMT''') was a research project directed by [[Gerry Stahl]] from 2003-2014 at the Math Forum at Drexel University in Philadelphia. A group of PhD students, Math Forum staff, interdisciplinary faculty, visiting researchers and international colleagues collaborated on the project.

==Overview==
The VMT Project was a paradigmatic example of [[computer-supported collaborative learning]] (CSCL). It developed an online service for math students to meet in small groups online to discuss challenging mathematical topics. It studied the usage of the technological environment designed for this service, using a method of ''chat interaction analysis'' that it refined. The project was guided by theories of collaborative learning, community knowledge building and [[group cognition]], that it explored and developed. It is an example of [[Postcognitivism|postcognitivist]] theory and practice.

[[File:Datasession.png|200px|framed|center|VMT data session]]

Much of the VMT research takes place in weekly “data sessions”,&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, B. &amp; Henderson, A. (1995). Interaction analysis: Foundations and practice. ''Journal of the Learning Sciences''. 4(1), 39-103. Web http://lrs.ed.uiuc.edu/students/c-merkel/document4.HTM&lt;/ref&gt; as pictured here.

A popular report on the beginnings of the VMT Project provides a good introduction: [http://GerryStahl.net/vmt/bridge.pdf download it here].

== The VMT environment ==
The VMT online environment consists of a Lobby and many chat rooms for the collaborative discussion of math. In the Lobby, students can define their profiles and browse the profiles of other students. They can send messages to other people. Mainly, teachers and students can see what chat rooms are already defined.

Most chat rooms are associated with a math subject and an interesting problem or topic to explore and discuss. The chat rooms include a number of shared whiteboards for drawing and organizing ideas. There are also web browsers. Each chat room has an associated wiki page, where teams can share their findings publicly. The VMT wiki is open to the world for reading, but users must register in VMT to post information there. Users can also create a new chat room and invite people to it.

The VMT environment was originally based on ConcertChat, a collaboration infrastructure developed in Germany. At first it was extended for VMT by the original creators, then by Math Forum staff. It has subsequently been rewritten. ConcertChat and VMT are available as Open Source.

== VMT research ==
After a 2-year NSDL and a 6-year IERI grant from the US NSF ended, the VMT project collaborated with researchers at Carnegie-Mellon University through an NSF ALT grant to explore the use of software agents in the VMT environment; a list of publications related to the ALT grant is available [http://GerryStahl.net/vmt/altpubs.pdf here]. An ONR CKI grant also supported continuing data analysis.

During this period, the VMT Project integrated the Open Source dynamic math system, GeoGebra, into the VMT system. This created the first public multi-user version of a dynamic mathematics environment. VMT is still the only truly multi-user version of the internationally popular GeoGebra system for dynamic geometry and other dynamic math domains.

In September 2011, a 5-year NSF DR K-12 grant extended major work on VMT. This grant supported the implementation of  a more robust version of VMT-with-GeoGebra, with Math Forum technical support mainly by Tony Mantoan. Through weekly project meetings, the research team tried out different curricular approaches and developed a series of activities and tutorials for VMT-with-GeoGebra during 2011-2014—see [http://GerryStahl.net/elibrary/topics '''Adventures in Dynamic Geometry'''].

The VMT system is fully instrumented to support data collection and micro-analysis for research and design feedback. The VMT Project has produced hundreds of publications (download list [http://GerryStahl.net/vmt/pubs.pdf here]), including nine doctoral dissertations and four books: ''Group Cognition'' (2006), ''Studying Virtual Math Teams'' (2009), ''Translating Euclid'' (2013) and ''Constructing Dynamic Triangles Together'' (2016).

The VMT online environment is available at the Math Forum at NCTM. Here is a view of it:
[[File:Vmt.png|200px|framed|center|VMT screen]]
A VMT-mobile environment for tablets, iPads and all web browsers is also available. Here is a view of it:

== VMT publications ==
A GeoGebraBook with a VMT curriculum on constructing dependencies in dynamic geometry is available at: [http://ggbtu.be/b140867]. This is an active book that lets one work on 50 team activities in GeoGebra. Unfortunately, since it runs outside of VMT in standard GeoGebra, it is not multi-user, it is not persistent, there is no chat and it is not instrumented for research or teacher analytics. Hopefully, GeoGebra will soon make its GeoGebraBooks multi-user. Here are some views of the VMT GeoGebraBook:

[[File:Booktwo.png|300px|framed|center|GeoGebraBook challenge]]
[[File:Bookthr.png|400px|framed|center|GeoGebraBook challenge]]
 
An extensive list of publications related to the VMT project is available at [http://GerryStahl.net/pubs]; the most detailed presentations and reflections on all aspects of the project are: ''Studying Virtual Math Teams'' and ''Translating Euclid''.

[http://GerryStahl.net/gc '''Group Cognition'''] (MIT Press, 2006) provides the background to the VMT Project by showing the weaknesses of existing software and even innovative prototypes for supporting collaborative learning of mathematics. An initial analysis of proposal making interactions in VMT is included.

[http://GerryStahl.net/svmt '''Studying Virtual Math Teams'''] (Springer, 2009) tells the story of the VMT Project, in about 600 pages, in 28 chapters written by the research team members and collaborators from around the world. It includes reflections of issues of technology, pedagogy, theory and methodology.

[http://GerryStahl.net/euclid '''Translating Euclid'''] (Morgan &amp; Claypool, 2013) is a multi-dimensional analysis of the attempt by the VMT Project to translate geometry education into a human-centered, computer-supported, collaborative-learning, dynamic-geometry pedagogy based on design research. Written from 2010-2013, the book discusses: the VMT vision, the history of geometry education, philosophical issues, the mathematics of dynamic geometry, collaborative learning, research methods, theory of referential resources, pedagogy, curriculum and design-based research.

[http://GerryStahl.net/analysis '''Constructing Dynamic Triangles Together: The Development of Mathematical Group Cognition'''] (Cambridge University Press, 2016). This monograph analyzes the work of a group of three students as they become introduced to dynamic geometry during eight hour-long online sessions using VMT with GeoGebra. The monograph documents the team's development of mathematical group cognition. Introductory chapters motivate the study and discuss its case-study method. Concluding chapters reflect on the group-cognitive development and its implications for re-design of the math curriculum. 
 
'''Gerry Stahl's Assembled Texts''' is available at [http://GerryStahl.net/elibrary his '''eLibrary''']. It contains collected volumes of hundreds of essays and other texts related to the VMT Project. They can be downloaded for free in various formats.
