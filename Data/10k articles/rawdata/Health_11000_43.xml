'''Abimbola Gbemi Alao''' also known as '''Abi Alao''', was born in [[Ibadan, Nigeria]]. She is a performance storyteller, author, children's book translator and researcher. She currently lives in England.

==Biography==

Abimbola studied at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, where she gained a BA (Hon) Classics in 1988 and an MA Classics in 1991. She later studied PGCE and MA in Creative Writing at the [[University of Plymouth]].

Abimbola is the author of ''Trickster Tales for Telling'' (2016), ''How to Enhance Your Storytelling With Music'' (2016),''The Legendary Weaver: New Edition'', a young-adult fiction book (2003 and 2011), and ''The Goshen Principle: A Shelter in the Time of Storm'' (2010). She has also written numerous poems, short stories and plays. In 2008, her short play, 'Legal Stuff', won the [[BBC]] and [[Royal Court Theatre]] '24 Degrees' Writing Competition. In 2011-2012, she wrote a collection of fables for KidsOut World Stories; this project won the 2013 Talk Talk Digital Heroes award for the East of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kidsout.org.uk/parliamentary-glory-for-world-stories|title=Parliamentary glory for World Stories|date=October 2013|work=[[Award]]|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/digital-heroes-regional-winners-announced-2286373|title=Digital Heroes Regional Winners|date=October 2013|work=[[Storytelling]]|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
She is a children's book translator and her work includes translation of the classics: 'Hansel and Gretel', 'The Little Red Hen and the Grain of Wheat' and several other books, published by Mantra Lingua publishers.

Abimbola was a tutor at the Institute of Education, [[University of Plymouth]], from 2003 to 2007 and was appointed as a lecturer in Creative Writing at the [[University of St Mark &amp; St John]] (MARJON), Plymouth, in 2007. A recipient of Plymouth's 2017 Mayflower Scholarship, she is currently researching the influence of physical and cognitive non-pharmacological intervention on disease progression in people living with dementia.

Abimbola is the lead provider of 'StoryWeavers for Dementia', a Special Study Unit (SSU) in Medical Humanities, at the Peninsula School of Medicine and Dentistry, Plymouth. The program, developed by Abimbola, explores non-pharmacological approach to dementia care, and offered to people who live with various forms of dementia. In 2015, Abimbola collaborated with the Alzheimer's Society to run a 12-week project with service users in memory cafes. This culminated in an anthology titled, 'Narrative Adventures from Plymouth Memory Cafes'. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sdcc.net/student/700-dementia-story-telling.html|title=Dementia story-telling is awesome|date=January 2014|work=[[Stoke Damerel Community College]]|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, Stoke Damerel College in Plymouth participated in StoryWeavers for Dementia; the school won the Prime Minister's Dementia Friendly Award: Schools Category in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sdcc.net/student/793-national-award-for-dementia-project.html|title=National award for Dementia Project|date=May 2014|work=[[Stoke Damerel Community College]]|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''aging of Japan''' is thought to outweigh all other nations, with Japan being purported to have the highest proportion of [[Elderly people in Japan|elderly citizens]]. Japan is experiencing a “super-aging” society both in rural and urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/51/4/425/599276/Japan-Super-Aging-Society-Preparing-for-the-Future|title=Japan: Super-Ageing Society Preparing for the Future|last=Muramatsu|first=Naoko|date=August 1, 2011|website=Oxford Academic|access-date=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2014 estimates, 33.0% of the Japanese population is above the age of 60, 25.9% are aged 65 or above, 12.5% are aged 75 or above.&lt;ref name=Nenkan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication|first1=Statistics Bureau|url=http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/nenkan/1431-02.htm|title=Japan Statistical Yearbook, Chapter 2: Population and Households|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; People aged 65 and older in Japan make up a quarter of its total population, estimated to reach a third by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilcjapan.org/agingE/|title=Aging in Japan｜ILC-Japan|website=www.ilcjapan.org|accessdate=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan had a post war baby boom between 1947 and 1949. The law of 1948 led to easy access to abortions, followed by a prolonged period of low fertility, resulting in the aging population of Japan.&lt;ref name="The Globe and Mail"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/retirement/retire-planning/how-japan-is-coping-with-a-rapidly-aging-population/article27259703/|title=Bold steps: Japan’s remedy for a rapidly aging society|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dramatic aging of Japanese society as a result of [[sub-replacement fertility]] [[Total fertility rate|rates]] and [[List of countries by life expectancy|high life expectancy]] is expected to continue.

Japanese citizens largely view Japan as comfortable and modern, resulting in no sense of a population crisis.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The [[government of Japan]] has responded to concerns about the stress that demographic changes place on the [[Japanese economy|economy]] and [[Welfare in Japan|social services]] with policies intended to restore the fertility rate and make the elderly more active in society.&lt;ref name="yoshida"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yoshida|first1=Reiji|title=Abe convenes panel to tackle low birthrate, aging population|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/10/29/national/politics-diplomacy/abe-convenes-panel-tackle-low-birthrate-aging-population/|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=The Japan Times|date=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aging dynamics ==
{{See|Demography of Japan}}

The number of Japanese people with ages 65&amp;nbsp;years or older nearly quadrupled in the last forty years, to 33 million in 2014, accounting for 26% of Japan's population. In the same period, the number of children (aged 14 and younger) decreased from 24.3% of the population in 1975 to 12.8% in 2014.&lt;ref name=Nenkan /&gt; The number of elderly people surpassed the number of children in 1997, and sales of [[adult diapers]] surpassed diapers for babies in 2014.&lt;ref name=n&gt;{{cite news|title=Fighting Population Decline, Japan Aims to Stay at 100 Million|url=http://www.nippon.com/en/features/h00057/|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=Nippon.com|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change in the demographic makeup of Japanese society, referred to as [[population aging]] (''{{lang|ja|kōreikashakai}}'', {{lang|ja|高齢化社会}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Traphagan |first=John W. |title=Demographic Change and the Family in Japan's Aging Society| publisher =SUNY Press |series=Suny Series in Japan in Transition, SUNY Series in Aging and Culture, Suny Series in Japan in Transition and Suny Series in Aging and Culture |year=2003 |page=16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnUh8lS1gPYC&amp;pg=PA16 |isbn=0791456498}}&lt;/ref&gt; has taken place in a shorter span of time than in any other country.

According to projections of the population with the current fertility rate, over&amp;nbsp;65s will account for 40% of the population by 2060,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan population to shrink by a third by 2060|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/30/japan-population-shrink-third|accessdate=14 January 2016|work=The Guardian|date=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/frm_GraphicalDisplay.aspx?ListNames=%22Population+65+or+More+as+Percent+of+Total%22&amp;HistFor=False&amp;GrpOp=0&amp;Dim1=81&amp;File=0 |title=Population of Japan, Aged 65 and older| author=[[International Futures]] | accessdate = 2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the total population will fall by a third from 128 million in 2010 to 87 million in 2060.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipss.go.jp/site-ad/index_english/esuikei/ppfj2012.pdf ''Population Projections for Japan (January 2012): 2011 to 2060''], table 1-1 (National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, retrieved 13 January 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Economists at [[Tohoku University]] established a countdown to national extinction, which estimates that Japan will have only one remaining child in 4205.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yoshida|first1=Hiroshi|last2=Ishigaki|first2=Masahiro|title=Web Clock of Child Population in Japan|url=http://mega.econ.tohoku.ac.jp/Children/index_en_2016.jsp|publisher=Mail Research Group, Graduate School of Economics and Management, Tohoku University|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These predictions prompted a pledge by Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]] to halt [[population decline]] at 100 million.&lt;ref name="yoshida" /&gt;&lt;ref name=n /&gt;

{{Further|Marriage in Japan}}
The aging of the Japanese population is a result of one of the world's [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by fertility rate|lowest fertility rates]] combined with the [[List of countries by life expectancy|highest life expectancy]].

===High life expectancy===
The reason for Japan's growing aging population is because of high life expectancy. Japan's life expectancy in 2016 was 85 years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html&lt;/ref&gt; The life expectancy is 81.7 for males and 88.5 for females.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ja.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since Japan's overall population is shrinking due to low fertility rates, the aging population is rapidly increasing.&lt;ref name="Population Aging and Life Expectancy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilcjapan.org/agingE/doc/POJ_2013_1.pdf|title=Population Aging and Aged Society: Population Aging and Life Expectancy|publisher=International Longevity Center Japan |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321175609/http://www.ilcjapan.org/agingE/doc/POJ_2013_1.pdf |archivedate=March 21, 2017 |deadurl=no |accessdate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors such as improved nutrition, advanced medical and pharmacological technologies reduced the prevalence of diseases, improving living conditions. Moreover, peace and prosperity following [[World War II]] was integral to the massive economic growth of [[post-war Japan]], leading to longer lifespans.&lt;ref name="Population Aging and Life Expectancy"/&gt; Proportion of health care spending has dramatically increased as Japan's older population spends time in hospitals and visits physicians. 2.9% people aged 75–79 were in a hospital and 13.4% visited physicians on any given day in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ilcjapan.org/agingE/doc/POJ_2013_4.pdf |title=Health Status: Utilization of Health Care|publisher=International Longevity Center Japan|website=|accessdate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life expectancy at birth has increased rapidly from the end of [[Pacific War|World War II]], when the average was 54&amp;nbsp;years for women and 50 for men, as a result of improvements in medicine and nutrition, and the percentage of the population aged 65&amp;nbsp;years and older has increased steadily from the 1950s. The advancement of life expectancy translated into a depressed mortality rate until the 1980s, but mortality has increased again to 10.1 per 1000 people in 2013, the highest since 1950.&lt;ref name=Nenkan /&gt;

===Low fertility rate===
[[File:Non marital by countries.gif|thumb|450px|The percentage of births to unmarried women in selected countries, 1980 and 2007.&lt;ref name="non_mar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db18.htm|title=Changing Patterns of Nonmarital Childbearing in the United States |work=CDC/National Center for Health Statistics|date=May 13, 2009|accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As can be seen in the figure, Japan has not followed the trend of other Western countries of children born outside of marriage to the same degree.]]

Japan's [[total fertility rate]] (the number of children born by each woman in her lifetime) has been below the replacement threshold of 2.1 since 1974 and reached a historic low of 1.26 in 2005.&lt;ref name=Nenkan /&gt; Experts believe that signs of a slight recovery reflect the expiration of a "[[Sub-replacement fertility#Tempo effect|tempo effect]]," as fertility rates accommodate a major shift in the timing and number of children, rather than any positive change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harding|first1=Robin|title=Japan birth rate recovery questioned|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d386b5a6-bb56-11e5-bf7e-8a339b6f2164.html|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=Financial Times|date=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, the TFR was 1.41 children born/woman.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;

Demographic trends are altering relations within and across generations, creating new government responsibilities and changing many aspects of Japanese social life. The aging and decline of the working-age population has triggered concerns about the future of the nation's workforce, the potential for economic growth, and the solvency of the [[Japan Pension Service|national pension]] and [[Health care system in Japan|healthcare services]].&lt;ref&gt;Hashimoto, Ryutaro (attributed).

===Social===
A smaller population could make the country's crowded metropolitan areas more livable, and the stagnation of economic output might still benefit a shrinking workforce. However, the low birthrate and high life expectancy has also inverted the standard [[population pyramid]], forcing a narrowing base of young people to provide and care for a bulging older cohort even as they try to form families of their own.&lt;ref name="soble"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Soble|first1=Jonathan|title=Japan Lost Nearly a Million People in 5 Years, Census Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/27/world/asia/japan-confirms-a-decline-in-population.html|accessdate=27 February 2016|work=New York Times|date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[Dependency ratio|aged dependency ratio]] (the ratio of people over&amp;nbsp;65 to those age&amp;nbsp;15–65, indicating the ratio of the dependent elderly population to those of working age) was 40%, meaning two aged dependents for every five workers.&lt;ref name=Nenkan /&gt; This is expected to increase to 60% by 2036 and to nearly 80% by 2060.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipss.go.jp/site-ad/index_english/esuikei/ppfj2012.pdf ''Population Projections for Japan (January 2012): 2011 to 2060''], table 1-4 (National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, retrieved 13 January 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Elderly Japanese have traditionally commended themselves to the care of their adult children, and government policies still encourage the creation of {{Nihongo|''sansedai kazoku''|三世代家族||"three-generation households"}}, where a married couple cares for both children and parents. In 2015, 177,600 people between the ages of 15 and 29 were caring directly for an older family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oi|first1=Mariko|title=Who will look after Japan's elderly?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-31901943|accessdate=23 February 2016|work=BBC|date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the migration of young people into Japan's major cities, the entrance of women into the workforce, and the increasing cost of care for both young and old dependents have required new solutions, including [[Nursing home care|nursing homes]], [[adult daycare center]]s, and home health programs.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;Kelly, William. "Finding a Place in Metropolitan Japan: Transpositions of Everyday Life." Ed. Andrew Gordon. ''Postwar Japan as History''. University of California Press, 1993. pp. 208–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Every year Japan closes 400 primary and secondary schools, converting some of them to care centers for the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNeill|first1=David|title=Falling Japanese population puts focus on low birth rate|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/falling-japanese-population-puts-focus-on-low-birth-rate-1.2450457|accessdate=24 February 2016|work=The Irish Times|date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are special nursing homes in Japan that offer service and assistance to more than 30 residents. In 2008, it has been recorded that there were approximate 6,000 special nursing homes available that compensated 420,000 Japanese elders.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trends and Factors in Japan's Long-term Care Insurance System: Japan's 10-year Experience|last=Olivares-Tirado|first=Pedro|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=978-94-007-7874-0|location=|pages=80–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; With many nursing homes in Japan, the demand for more caregivers is high. In Japan, [[Family caregivers]] are preferred as the main caregiver, because it is a better support system if an elderly person is related to his/her caregiver. Therefore, it is possible that Japanese elderlies can perform [[activities of daily living]] (ADL's) with little assistance and live longer if his/her caregiver is a family caregiver.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Many elderly people live alone and isolated, and every year thousands of deaths go unnoticed for days or even weeks, in a modern phenomenon known as {{Nihongo|''kodoku-shi''|孤独死||"solitary death"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bremner|first1=Matthew|title=The Lonely End|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/roads/2015/06/kodokushi_in_aging_japan_thousands_die_alone_and_unnoticed_every_year_their.html|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=Slate|date=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disposable income in Japan's older population has increased business in biomedical technologies research in cosmetics and regenerative medicine.&lt;ref name="The Globe and Mail"/&gt;

===Political===
The [[Greater Tokyo Area]] is virtually the only locality in Japan to see population growth, mostly due to internal migration from other parts of the country. Between 2005 and 2010, 36 of Japan's [[Prefectures of Japan|47 prefectures]] shrank by as much as 5%,&lt;ref name=Nenkan /&gt; and many rural and suburban areas are struggling with an epidemic of abandoned homes (8 million across Japan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Otake|first1=Tomoko|title=Abandoned homes a growing menace|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/01/07/national/abandoned-homes-a-growing-menace/|accessdate=27 February 2016|work=The Japan Times|date=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Soble|first1=Jonathan|title=A Sprawl of Ghost Homes in Aging Tokyo Suburbs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/24/world/a-sprawl-of-abandoned-homes-in-tokyo-suburbs.html|accessdate=27 February 2016|work=New York Times|date=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masuda Hiroya, a former [[Minister for Internal Affairs and Communications]] who heads the private think tank Japan Policy Council, estimated that about half the [[Municipalities of Japan|municipalities]] in Japan could disappear between now and 2040 as young people, especially young women, move from rural areas into [[Tokyo]], [[Osaka]], and [[Nagoya]], where around half of Japan's population is already concentrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tadashi|first1=Hitora|title=Slowing the Population Drain From Japan’s Regions|url=http://www.nippon.com/en/column/g00189/|accessdate=24 February 2016|work=Nippon.com|date=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government is establishing a regional revitalization task force and focusing on developing regional hub cities, especially [[Sapporo]], [[Sendai]], [[Hiroshima]], and [[Fukuoka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abe to target revitalization at regional level|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/07/21/national/politics-diplomacy/abe-to-target-revitalization-at-regional-level/|accessdate=24 February 2016|work=The Japan Times|agency=Jiji|date=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Internal migration]] and population decline have created a severe regional imbalance in [[Elections in Japan|electoral power]], where the weight of a single vote depends on where it was cast. Some depopulated districts send three times as many representatives per voter to the [[National Diet]] as their growing urban counterparts. In 2014, the [[Supreme Court of Japan]] declared the disparities in voting power violate the [[Constitution of Japan|Constitution]], but the ruling [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]], which relies on rural and older voters, has been slow to make the necessary realignment.&lt;ref name=soble /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Masunaga|first1=Hidetoshi|title=The Quest for Voting Equality in Japan|url=http://www.nippon.com/en/in-depth/a02303/|accessdate=27 February 2016|work=Nippon.com|date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Takenaka|first1=Harukata|title=Weighing Vote Disparity in Japan's Upper House|url=http://www.nippon.com/en/in-depth/a04401/|accessdate=27 February 2016|work=Nippon.com|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing proportion of elderly people has a major impact on government spending and policies. As recently as the early- 1970s, the cost of public pensions, health care and welfare services for the aged amounted to only about 6% of Japan's [[Gross national income|national income]]. In 1992 that portion of the national budget was 18%, and it is expected that by 2025 28% of national income will be spent on social welfare.&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Faiola|first1=Anthony|title=The Face of Poverty Ages In Rapidly Graying Japan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/27/AR2006072701856.html|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=28 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the incidence of chronic disease increases with age, the health care and pension systems are expected to come under severe strain. In the mid- 1980s the government began to reevaluate the relative burdens of government and the private sector in [[health care]] and [[pension]]s, and it established policies to control government costs in these programs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vlandas|first1=T|title=Grey power and the economy: Ageing and inflation across advanced economies|journal=Comparative Political Studies |date=2017|doi=10.1177/0010414017710261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large share of elderly inflation averse voters may also hinder the political attractiveness of pursuing higher inflation consistent with the evidence that ageing may lead to lower inflation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; With the increasing older population and decreasing young population, 38% percent of the population will be people aged 65 and older by 2065. This concludes that Japan has the highest amount of [[public debt]] in the world because of the low fertility rates and aging population.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/japan-population-drop-39-million-2065-birth-rate-plummet-children-demographic-timebomb-a7678116.html|title=Japan’s population set to plummet by 40 million in a generation|last=|first=|date=2017-04-11|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-03-13|publisher=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's government has spent almost half of its tax revenue trying to recover from their debt. According to IMF, Japan has a 246.14 debt percentage of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] making it the highest public debt.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/07/the-20-countries-with-the-greatest-public-debt/|title=The 20 countries with the greatest public debt|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
{{main|Economy of Japan}}
[[File:Real GDP growth rate in Japan (1956-2008).png|450px|thumb|Real GDP change in Japan (1956 to 2008).]]

Since the 1980s, there has been an increase of older-age workers and a shortage of young workers in Japan's [[workforce]], from [[Japanese work environment|employment practices]] to benefits to the [[Women in Japan#Professional life|participation of women]]. The [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] estimated in 2002 that Japan would experience an 18% decrease of young workers in its workforce and 8% decrease in its [[consumer]] population by 2030. The [[Labor market of Japan|Japanese labor market]] is already under pressure to meet demands for workers, with 125 jobs for every 100 [[Job hunting|job seekers]] at the end of 2015, as older generations retire and younger generations become smaller in quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warnock|first1=Eleanor|title=Japan consumer prices up, but spending sluggish|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/japan-consumer-prices-up-but-spending-sluggish-2015-12-24|access-date=21 February 2016|work=Market Watch|date=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan made a radical change in how its healthcare system is regulated by introducing long-term care insurance in 2000.&lt;ref name="The Globe and Mail"/&gt; The proportion of old Japanese citizens will soon level off, however; there is a decline in young population due to zero growth, death exceeding the births. For example, number of young people under the age of 19 in Japan will constitute only 13 percent in the year 2060, which used to be 40 percent in 1960.&lt;ref name="The Globe and Mail"/&gt;

Japan's aging population is considered economically prosperous profiting the large corporations. Lawson Inc., a Japanese convenience store chain has salons for senior citizens that feature adult wipes and diapers, strong detergents to eliminate urine on bed mats, straw cups, gargling basins, and rice and water.&lt;ref name="The Globe and Mail"/&gt; The decline in the working population is impacting the national economy. It is causing a shrinkage of the nation's military.&lt;ref name="The Globe and Mail"/&gt; The government has focused on medical technologies such as regenerative medicines and cell therapy to recruit and retain more older population into the work force.&lt;ref name="The Globe and Mail"/&gt;

Mounting labor shortages in the 1980s and 90s led many Japanese companies to increase the [[Elderly people in Japan#Aging and retirement of the labor force|mandatory retirement age]] from 55 to 60 or 65, and today many allow their employees to continue working after official [[retirement]]. The growing number of [[retirement age]] people has put strain on the [[national Pension (Japan)|national pension system]]. In 1986, the government increased the age at which pension benefits begin from 60 to 65, and shortfalls in the pension system have encouraged many people of retirement age to remain in the workforce and have driven some others into poverty.&lt;ref name="WP" /&gt;

The retirement age may go even higher in the future if Japan continues to have older age populations in its overall population. A study by the [[United Nations|UN]] [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|Population Division]] released in 2000 found that Japan would need to raise its retirement age to 77 (or allow net [[immigration]] of 17 million by 2050) to maintain its worker-to-retiree ratio.&lt;ref name="c"&gt;{{cite web|author=Unknown|year=2000|url=http://www.globalaging.org/health/world/overall.htm|title=Aging Populations in Europe, Japan, Korea, Require Action|publisher=India Times|accessdate=2007-12-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201192143/http://www.globalaging.org/health/world/overall.htm|archivedate=2007-12-01|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/migration/japan.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent immigration into Japan may prevent further population decline, therefore, it is encouraged that Japan develops policies that will support large influx of young immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schlesinger|first=Jacob M.|year=2015|title=Aging Gracefully: entrepreneurs and exploring robotics and other innovations to unleash the potential of the elderly.|url=|journal=WSJ|volume=|pages=1–15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Less desirable industries, such as [[Agriculture, forestry, and fishing in Japan|agriculture]] and [[Construction industry of Japan|construction]], are more threatened than others.

==Government policies==
{{Main|Family policy in Japan}}

The [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] is addressing demographic problems by developing policies to encourage fertility and keep more of its population, especially women and elderly, engaged in the workforce.&lt;ref name="kantei"&gt;{{cite web|title=Urgent Policies to Realize a Society in Which All Citizens are Dynamically Engaged|url=http://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/topics/2015/ichiokusoukatsuyaku/kinkyujisshitaisaku_en.pdf|website=Kantei (Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet)|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incentives for family formation include expanded opportunities for childcare, new benefits for those who have children, and a state-sponsored dating service.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-16500768 | work=BBC News | title=Young Japanese 'decline to fall in love' | date=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ghosh|first1=Palash|title=Japan Encourages Young People To Date And Mate To Reverse Birth Rate Plunge, But It May Be Too Late|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/japan-encourages-young-people-date-mate-reverse-birth-rate-plunge-it-may-be-too-late-1562867|accessdate=24 February 2016|work=International Business Times|date=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some policies have focused on engaging more [[Women in Japan|women]] in the workplace, including longer [[maternity leave]] and legal protections against [[pregnancy discrimination]], known in Japan as {{nihongo|''matahara''|マタハラ||maternity harassment}}.&lt;ref name="kantei" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodionova|first1=Zlata|title=Half of Japanese women workers fall victim to 'maternity harassment' after pregnancy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/half-of-japanese-women-workers-fall-victim-to-maternity-harassment-after-pregnancy-a6736386.html|accessdate=24 February 2016|work=The Independent|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "Womenomics," the set of policies intended to bring more women into the workplace as part of Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]]'s [[Abenomics|economic recovery plan]], has struggled to overcome cultural barriers and entrenched stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chen|first1=Emily S.|title=When Womenomics Meets Reality|url=http://thediplomat.com/2015/10/when-womenomics-meets-reality/|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=The Diplomat|date=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These policies could prove useful for bringing women back into the workforce after having children, but they can also encourage the women who opt not to have children to join the workforce. The Japanese government has introduced other policies to address the growing elderly population as well, especially in rural areas. Many young people end up moving to the city in search of work, leaving behind a growing elderly population and a smaller work force to take care of them. Because of this, Japan's national government has tried to improve [[welfare]] services such as long-term care facilities and other services that can help families at home such as day-care or in-home nursing assistance. The Gold Plan was introduced in 1990 to improve these services and attempted to reduce the burden of care placed on families, followed by [[long-term care insurance]] (LTCI) in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanaka|first=Kimiko|last2=Iwasawa|first2=Miho|date=October 2010|title=Aging in Rural Japan—Limitations in the Current Social Care Policy|journal=[[Journal of Aging &amp; Social Policy]]|volume=22|issue=4|pages=394–406|doi=10.1080/08959420.2010.507651|issn=0895-9420|pmc=2951623|pmid=20924894}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans have been upgraded and revised over the years to provide more local welfare services and institutions in rural areas, yet the rapidly increasing elderly population makes these efforts difficult to maintain.

A net decline in population due to a historically [[Marriage in Japan#Marriage and fertility|low birth rate]] has raised the issue of immigration, as a way to compensate for [[Shortage#Labor shortage|labor shortages]].&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/01/asia/japan-migrants-immigration/index.html|title=Can Japan survive without immigrants?|last1=CNN|last2=Jozuka|first2=Emiko|last3=Ogura|last4=CNN Graphics by Natalie Leung|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brasor |first1=Philip |title=Proposed reform to Japan’s immigration law causes concern |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/10/27/national/media-national/proposed-reform-japans-immigration-law-causes-concern/#.W_mQ4ehKiUk |accessdate=24 November 2018 |work=Japan Times |date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While public opinion polls tend to show low support for immigration, most people support an expansion in [[Working age|working-age]] [[Immigration|migrants]] on a temporary basis to maintain Japan's economic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201504180035.html |title=51% of Japanese support immigration, double from 2010 survey - AJW by The Asahi Shimbun |publisher=Ajw.asahi.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = "Our findings indicate that among the non-treated sample, only 29% of the population supported an increase in levels of immigration, a finding that is consistent with the restrictive immigration policy stance currently pursued by the Japanese government." | last1 = Facchini | first1 = G. | last2 = Margalit | first2 = Y. | last3 = Nakata | first3 = H. | title = Countering Public Opposition to Immigration: The Impact of Information Campaigns | url = http://ftp.iza.org/dp10420.pdf | pages = 19 | year = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative reviews show that Japanese attitudes are broadly neutral and place Japanese acceptance of migrants in the middle of [[Developed country|developed countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2547704 |title=A Comparative Assessment of Public Opinion toward Immigrants and Immigration Policies |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/216377/new-index-shows-least-accepting-countries-migrants.aspx |title=New Index Shows Least, Most Accepting Countries for Migrants |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, immigration might save their economy due to the low percentage of the working-age population. Opening up more desired, favorable jobs will bring in immigrants who are in the working-age population. This will help better the economy and the elders will be taken care of by the influx of immigrants. Only two percent of the total population is made up of foreign residents which shows that there might not be much opportunities for foreigners to thrive on.

Immigrants would have to increase by eight percent, in order for Japan's economy to be stable. Japan's government is first trying to increase tourism rates which increases their economy and brings in foreign workers. The government has also recruited international students which allow foreigners to begin work and potentially stay in Japan to help the economy. However, Japan is strict when accepting refugees into their country. Only 27 people out of 7,500 refugee applicants were granted into Japan in 2015. Though, Japan provides high levels of foreign and [[humanitarian aid]].&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/its-population-ages-japan-quietly-turns-immigration|title=As Its Population Ages, Japan Quietly Turns to Immigration|last=Green|first=David|date=2017-03-27|work=migrationpolicy.org|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, there was a 44% increase in [[asylum seeker]]s to Japan from Indonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines. Since Japan did not desire low-skilled workers to enter, many people went through the asylum route instead. This allowed immigrants to apply for the asylum and begin work six months after the application. However, it did not allow foreigners without valid visas to apply for work.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Work-life balance ===
{{Further|Japanese work environment|Salaryman}}

Japan has focused its policies on the [[work-life balance]] with the goal of improving the conditions for increasing the birth rate.
To address these challenges, Japan has established goals to define the ideal work-life balance that would provide the environment for couples to have more children with the passing of the Child Care and Family Care Leave Law, which took effect in June 2010.&lt;ref name="mhlw.go.jp"&gt;Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, “Introduction to the Revised Child Care and Family Care Leave Law,” http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/index.html, accessed May 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law provides both mothers and fathers with an opportunity to take up to one year of leave after the birth of a child (with possibility to extend the leave for another 6 months if the child is not accepted to enter nursery school) and allows employees with preschool-age children the following allowances: up to five days of leave in the event of a child's injury or sickness, limits on the amount of overtime in excess of 24 hours per month based on an employee's request, limits on working late at night based on an employee's request, and opportunity for shorter working hours and flex time for employees.&lt;ref name="hellowork.go.jp"&gt;Japanese government's Employment Service Center “雇用継続給付” https://www.hellowork.go.jp/insurance/insurance_continue.html, Retrieved April 24, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of the law would strive to achieve the following results in 10 years are categorized by the female employment rate (increase from 65% to 72%), percentage of employees working 60 hours or more per week (decrease from 11% to 6%), rate of use of annual paid leave (increase from 47% to 100%), rate of child care leave (increase from 72% to 80% for females and .6% to 10% for men), and hours spent by men on child care and housework in households with a child under six years of age (increase from 1 hour to 2.5 hours a day).&lt;ref name="mhlw.go.jp"/&gt;

==Comparisons with other countries==
[[File:POP-GIF-5.gif|thumb|Population Pyramid]]
Japan's population is [[Aging population|aging]] faster than any other country on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan's demography: The incredible shrinking country|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2014/03/japans-demography|accessdate=14 January 2016|work=The Economist|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of those 65&amp;nbsp;years or older roughly doubled in 24 years, from 7.1% of the population in 1970 to 14.1% in 1994. The same increase took 61 years in [[Demographics of Italy|Italy]], 85 years in [[Demographics of Sweden|Sweden]], and 115 years in [[Demographics of France|France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistical Handbook of Japan|url=http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/handbook/c0117.htm|publisher=Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication|accessdate=14 January 2016|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life expectancy for women in Japan is 87 years, five years more than that of the U.S.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/graying-japan-tries-to-embrace-the-golden-years-1448808028|title=The Wall Street Journal|author1=Jacob Schlesinger |author2=Alexander Martin |date=November 29, 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men in Japan with a life expectancy of 81 years, have surpassed U.S. life expectancy by four years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Japan also has more [[centenarian]]s than any other country (58,820 in 2014, or 42.76 per 100,000 people).

In contrast to Japan, a more open immigration policy has allowed [[Immigration to Australia|Australia]], [[Immigration to Canada|Canada]], and the [[Immigration to the United States|United States]] to grow their workforce despite low fertility rates.&lt;ref name=f /&gt; An expansion of [[Immigration to Japan|immigration]] is often rejected as a solution to population decline by Japan's political leaders and people. Reasons include a fear of foreign crime, a desire to preserve cultural traditions, and a belief in the ethnic and racial homogeneity of the Japanese nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burgess|first1=Chris|title=Japan’s ‘no immigration principle’ looking as solid as ever|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2014/06/18/voices/japans-immigration-principle-looking-solid-ever/|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=The Japan Times|date=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, European countries have had the largest elderly populations by proportion as they became developed nations earlier and experienced the subsequent drop in fertility rates, but many Asian and Latin American countries are quickly catching up.  As of 2015, 22 of the 25 oldest countries are located in Europe, but Japan is currently the oldest country in the world and its rapidly aging population displays a trend that other Asian countries such as [[South Korea]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Taiwan]] are expected to follow by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=He, Wan; Goodkind, Daniel; &amp; Kowal, Paul.|first=|date=March 2016|title=An Aging World : 2015|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2016/demo/P95-16-1.html|journal=International Population Reports|volume=16|pages=1–30|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As recently developed nations continue to experience improved health care and lower fertility rates, the growth of the elderly population will continue to rise. In 1970-1975, only 19 countries had a fertility rate that can be considered below-replacement fertility and there were not any countries with exceedingly low fertility (&lt;1.3 children); however, between 2000-2005, there were 65 countries with below-replacement fertility and 17 with exceedingly low fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/meetings/Proceedings_EGM_Mex_2005/ogawa.pdf|title=Ageing in Japan: The health and wealth of older persons|last=Naohiro Ogawa; Rikiya Matsukura|first=|date=2007|website=un.org|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there has been a global trend of lower fertility and longer life expectancy, it is first evident in the more developed countries and occurs more rapidly in developing or recently developed countries.  One of the most astounding aspects of Japan's elderly population, in particular, is that it is both fast-growing and has one of the highest life expectancies equating to a larger elderly population and an older one. According to the [[World Health Organization]], Japanese people are able to live 75 years without any disabilities and fully healthy compared to other countries. Also, American women usually live to around 81 years and American men 76; but compared to Japan, women live to around 87 years and men to 80 years.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/japan-has-highest-life-expectancy-any-major-country-why-n130871|title=Japan Has The Highest Life Expectancy Of Any Major Country.

They, also, have the highest proportion of the elderly population as well with the highest population decline of developed countries.

Japan is leading the world in aging demographics, but the other countries of [[East Asia]] are following a similar trend. In [[South Korea]], where the fertility rate often ranks among the lowest in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] (1.21 in 2014), the [[Demographics of South Korea|population]] is expected to peak in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kwanwoo|first1=Jun|title=South Korea’s Youth Population Slips Under 10 Million|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/07/11/south-koreas-youth-population-slips-under-10-million/|accessdate=27 February 2016|work=Wall Street Journal (Korea Realtime blog)|date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller states of [[Demographics of Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Demographics of Taiwan|Taiwan]] are also struggling to boost fertility rates from record lows and to manage aging populations. More than a third of the world's elderly (65 and older) live in East Asia and the Pacific, and many of the economic concerns raised first in Japan can be projected to the rest of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rapid Aging in East Asia and Pacific Will Shrink Workforce and Increase Public Spending|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eap/brief/rapid-aging-in-east-asia-and-pacific-will-shrink-workforce-increase-public-spending|accessdate=27 February 2016|work=World Bank|date=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of Population in Asia: Asia's Aging Population|url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/misc/FuturePop08Aging.pdf|website=East West Center|publisher=Honolulu: East-West Center|accessdate=27 February 2016|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's population is aging exactly like Japan, but with a 50-year lag.

The '''Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center''' at [[Barnes-Jewish Hospital]] and [[Washington University School of Medicine]] is a cancer treatment, research and education institution with six locations in the [[St. Louis]] area. Siteman is the only cancer center in Missouri and within 240 miles of St. Louis to be designated a [[Comprehensive Cancer Center]] by the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = VandeWater | first = Judith | title = St. Louis cancer center achieves highest designation | newspaper = St. Louis Post-Dispatch | date = 4 January 2005 | url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7767343_ITM | accessdate = 27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siteman is also the only area member of the [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = NCCN Member Institutions | publisher = National Comprehensive Cancer Network | url= http://www.nccn.org/members/network.asp | accessdate = 27 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit alliance of 28 cancer centers dedicated to improving the quality and effectiveness of cancer care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Siteman joins cancer center alliance | newspaper = St. Louis Business Journal | date = 21 March 2006 | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2006/03/20/daily21.html | accessdate = 29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Siteman received the highest rating possible - exceptional - by the NCI for cancer research. At Siteman's review leading to the rating, researchers presented their findings in genomics, cancer imaging, cancer prevention and disparities, and the use of the body's immune system to fight cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Munz |first= Michele |date= 7 July 2015 |title= Siteman Cancer Center earns highest rating from federal cancer institute |url= http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/siteman-cancer-center-earns-highest-rating-from-federal-cancer-institute/article_1ddf4080-0a7e-5d7b-a5ef-49b600ccda19.html |newspaper= St. Louis Post-Dispatch |location= St. Louis, Missouri |access-date= 14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Siteman was named a top 15 U.S. cancer center by [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Siteman Cancer Center Rankings &amp; Ratings | publisher= U.S. News &amp; World Report | url= https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/mo/barnes-jewish-hospitalwashington-university-6630930/cancer?int=scorecard-specialty-click | accessdate = 14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recognition is part of the overall ranking of its parent institutions, Barnes-Jewish Hospital, which is tied for No. 11 on the newsmagazine's “The Best Hospitals 2018-19 Honor Roll,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last1=Comarow | first1=Avery | last2=Harder | first2=Ben | date= 14 August 2018 | title = 2018-19 Best Hospitals Honor Roll and Medical Specialties Rankings | publisher= U.S. News &amp; World Report | url= https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview | accessdate = 14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Washington University School of Medicine, which is No. 8 on the newsmagazine's "2019 Best Medical Schools: Research" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 2019 Best Medical Schools: Research  | publisher= U.S. News &amp; World Report | url= https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/research-rankings | accessdate = 14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Siteman treated nearly 9,000 newly diagnosed cancer patients&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Siteman Cancer Center earns top federal agency rating | newspaper = St. Louis Business Journal | date = 10 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and every year provides continuing care to about 40,000 people, making it one of the largest cancer centers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Summary 3: Reportable Patients/Participation in Therapeutic Protocols | publisher = National Comprehensive Cancer Network | url = http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/data/sum3.html | accessdate = 6 April 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111113051358/http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/data/sum3.html | archive-date = 2011-11-13 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and leadership==

In 1999, Alvin J. and Ruth Siteman committed $35 million to the development of the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital. The commitment was the largest gift ever received by Barnes-Jewish and Washington University in support of cancer research, patient care and services, education and community outreach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Couple donate $35 million for cancer research | newspaper = St. Louis Post-Dispatch | date = 20 November 1999 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=%20COUPLE%20DONATE%20$%2035%20MILLION%20FOR%20CANCER%20RESEARCH | accessdate = 24 June 2013}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timothy Eberlein, M.D., has been director of the center since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Siteman Cancer Center gets $23M | newspaper = St. Louis Business Journal | date = 1 November 2010 | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2010/11/01/wash-u-gets-23m-for-siteman-cancer.html | accessdate = 27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; John DiPersio, M.D., Ph.D., is deputy director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = National Comprehensive Cancer Network, MD, PhD | publisher= Siteman Cancer Center | url= http://www.siteman.wustl.edu/DocProfile.aspx?Type=Patient&amp;memid=85 | accessdate = 29 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the NCI designated Siteman as a Cancer Center, which signaled that the institution had demonstrated significant scope and quality in its cancer research programs. The designation came with $850,000 per year in federal research grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = VandeWater | first = Judith | title = Siteman Center Here Wins Designation from National Cancer Institute | newspaper = St. Louis Post-Dispatch | date = 16 August 2001 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=SITEMAN%20CENTER%20HERE%20WINS%20DESIGNATION%20FROM%20NATIONAL%20CANCER%20INSTITUTE&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=2001&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=%28%22SITEMAN%20CENTER%20HERE%20WINS%20DESIGNATION%20FROM%20NATIONAL%20CANCER%20INSTITUTE%22%29&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no | accessdate = 15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCI named Siteman a Comprehensive Cancer Center in 2005, recognizing its broad-based research, outreach and education activities, and awarded the center a five-year, $21 million support grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = VandeWater | first = Judith | title = Siteman Cancer Center here achieves highest designation | newspaper = St. Louis Post-Dispatch | date = 4 January 2005 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=Siteman%20Cancer%20Center%20here%20achieves%20highest%20designation&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=2005&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=%28%22Siteman%20Cancer%20Center%20here%20achieves%20highest%20designation%22%29&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no | accessdate = 15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCI renewed the designation in 2010 and awarded another five-year grant, totaling $23 million.

===Research advances===

Researchers affiliated with Siteman and/or Washington University School of Medicine have pioneered important advances in cancer research, prevention, education and treatment. Highlights and ongoing studies include these projects:

'''2018 — Personalized brain cancer vaccines'''

* In a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a [[glioblastoma]] vaccine, some patients "lived significantly longer" - up to seven years longer - than most people who are diagnosed with the brain cancer. Researchers developed personalized vaccines for each patient, removing as much of the brain tumor as possible, then combining pieces of the tumor with cells from the patient’s immune system. This “trains” the immune cells to attack tumor cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Berson |first=Scott |date=30 May 2018 |title=Scientists created a brain-cancer vaccine - and so far it's 'remarkably promising' |url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article212173189.html |work=The McClatchy Company/Miami Herald |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2017 — CAR-T cell therapy and using Zika virus to fight brain cancer'''

* In a clinical trial at Siteman, at least 16 of 20 people who received a new treatment called CAR-T cell therapy saw their cancers disappear after treatment. The patients had previously failed standard therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Bernhard |first= Blythe |date= 19 August 2017 |title= New treatment for deadly blood cancers expected to be approved soon |url= http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/new-treatment-for-deadly-blood-cancers-expected-to-be-approved/article_14a09d12-5eea-5c3f-94bd-2a216e1eb58f.html |newspaper= St. Louis Post-Dispatch |access-date= 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The therapy, [[Axicabtagene ciloleucel]], received FDA approval on Oct. 18, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= McGinley |first= Laurie |date= 18 October 2017 |title= Cutting-edge immunotherapy treatment approved for another deadly cancer |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/10/19/cutting-edge-immunotherapy-treatment-approved-for-yet-another-deadly-cancer |newspaper= The Washington Post |access-date= 25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* While Zika virus causes devastating damage to the brains of developing fetuses, it one day may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma, a deadly form of brain cancer. Joint research from Washington University School of Medicine and [[UC San Diego School of Medicine]] shows that the virus kills brain cancer stem cells, the kind of cells most resistant to standard treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Roberts |first= Michelle |date= 5 September 2017 |title= Zika virus used to treat aggressive brain cancer |url= http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/new-treatment-for-deadly-blood-cancers-expected-to-be-approved/article_14a09d12-5eea-5c3f-94bd-2a216e1eb58f.html |newspaper= St. Louis Post-Dispatch |access-date= 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2016 — Chemotherapy for brain tumors'''

* Neurosurgeons using lasers to treat brain cancer discover that the technique breaks down the blood-brain barrier for about four weeks, allowing them to use chemotherapy to treat the tumor. A clinical trial is still ongoing, but Eric C. Leuthardt, M.D., considers the initial results promising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Gruber |first= Ben |date= 4 May 2016 |title= Laser brain cancer treatment may bring extra advantage |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cancer-brain-idUSKCN0XV28A |newspaper= Reuters |access-date= 13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2015 — Melanoma vaccine and urine test for kidney cancer'''

* In a proof of concept study, a research team led by Beatriz Carreno, Ph.D., shows that personalized medicine can "wake up" the immune systems of melanoma patients. Further study needs to be done to see if the customized vaccines can prevent recurrence in patients with advanced melanoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Norton |first= Amy |date= 2 April 2015 |title= Experimental Melanoma Vaccine Shows Early Promise |url= http://consumer.healthday.com/cancer-information-5/mis-cancer-news-102/experimental-melanoma-vaccine-shows-early-promise-698026.html |newspaper= HealthDay |access-date= 14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A urine-based screening test is found to be more than 95 percent accurate in identifying early-stage kidney cancer, according to a study led by Evan Kharasch, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= 20 March 2015 |title= Urine Test Shows Promise for Early Diagnosis of Kidney Cancer |url= http://consumer.healthday.com/cancer-information-5/kidney-cancer-news-431/urine-test-shows-promise-for-early-diagnosis-of-kidney-cancer-697607.html |newspaper= HealthDay |access-date= 14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2014 — Breast cancer vaccine and cancer goggles'''

* A breast cancer vaccine developed by William Gillanders, M.D., is shown to activate the immune system to fight tumor cells and slow down cancer progression. The vaccine, which targets [[mammaglobin-A]], a protein expressed in breast tumors, involved very few side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Mahesh |first= Roshni |date= 2 December 2014 |title= Vaccine to Slow Down Metastatic Breast Cancer |url= http://www.ibtimes.co.in/vaccine-slow-down-metastatic-breast-cancer-615771 |newspaper= International Business Times |access-date= 14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* High-tech goggles developed by [[Samuel Achilefu]], Ph.D., help surgeons see cancer cells in real time. The technology, which includes a digital display, infrared light and use of an intravenous dye, could negate the need for follow-up surgeries due to undetected cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Mintz |first= Joe |date= 11 February 2014 |title= New Glasses Makes Sure ‘No Cancer Is Left Behind,’ Causes Malignant Cells To Glow Blue |url= http://www.ibtimes.com/new-glasses-makes-sure-no-cancer-left-behind-causes-malignant-cells-glow-blue-photo-1554755 |newspaper= International Business Times |access-date= 14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2013 — Endometrial cancer and leukemia'''

* In separate studies, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine and the [[McDonnell Genome Institute]] help identify major genetic mutations that promote [[endometrial cancer]] and [[acute myeloid leukemia]]. The research, part of [[The Cancer Genome Atlas]] project, provides new information that could change treatments for patients and aid drug development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Winslow | first = Ron | title = Genomic Studies Unlock Details on Two Cancers | newspaper = The Wall Street Journal | date = 1 May 2013 | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324582004578456701717954658 | accessdate = 1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2012 — Leukemia, breast cancer research and cancer prevention'''

* Siteman leukemia doctor Lukas Wartman, M.D., who was diagnosed with the disease himself, goes into remission for an unprecedented third time after [[Timothy Ley]], M.D., and his colleagues at the [[McDonnell Genome Institute]] sequenced Wartman’s cancerous and normal genes. Researchers also analyzed his [[RNA]]. By doing so, his treatment team, which includes John DiPersio, M.D., Ph.D., deputy director of Siteman, discovered that a normal gene might be contributing to the growth of Wartman's cancer by producing mass amounts of a certain protein. They found that a drug used to treat a type of kidney cancer was able to inhibit the gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kolata | first = Gina | title = In Treatment for Leukemia, Glimpses of the Future | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 7 July 2012 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/health/in-gene-sequencing-treatment-for-leukemia-glimpses-of-the-future.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate = 20 July 2012 }}{{cite episode | title = Frontiers in Cancer Research | episodelink =  | url = http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/12455 | series = Charlie Rose | serieslink =  | network = PBS | location = New York | airdate = 17 July 2012 | minutes = 28 | access-date = 2012-07-20 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120721201331/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/12455 | archivedate = 2012-07-21 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scientists including Matthew Ellis, M.B., Ph.D., use [[whole genome sequencing]] to compare differences between the [[DNA]] of breast cancer tumors and healthy cells in 46 women. While revealing the complexity of the disease, the analysis suggests routes to personalized medicine that may have a greater probability of healing patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Gene therapy: Genetic mutations predict which cancers will respond to treatment | newspaper = The Economist | date = 16 June 2012 | url = http://www.economist.com/node/21556896 | accessdate = 16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2010 — Pediatric cancers'''

* Washington University School of Medicine and [[St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital]] announce their joint Pediatric Cancer Genome Project to identify the genetic changes that give rise to some of the world’s deadliest childhood cancers. The team plans to decode the genomes of more than 600 childhood cancer patients who have contributed tumor samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Szabo | first = Liz | title = Genetic study targets cancer in kids | newspaper = USA Today | date = 26 January 2010 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20100126/genome26_st.art.htm | accessdate = 20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2008 — Genetic sequencing'''

* For the first time, scientists decode all the genes of a cancer patient and find a suite of mutations that might have caused the disease or aided its progression. [[Timothy Ley]], M.D., [[Elaine Mardis]], Ph.D., [[Richard K. Wilson]], Ph.D., and their colleagues at [[McDonnell Genome Institute]] say the finding could lead to new therapies and could help doctors make better choices among existing treatments, based on a more detailed genetic picture of each patient's cancer. Though the research involved [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] (AML), the same techniques can also be used to study other cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Grady | first = Denise | title = Experts Decode Cancer Patient’s Genes, Seeking Treatment Clues  | newspaper = They New York Times | date = 6 November 2008 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/health/research/06cancer.html | accessdate = 20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2007 — Nanotechnology and radiation therapy'''

* Gregory Lanza, M.D., Ph.D., Samuel Wickline, M.D., and researchers in their labs announce the development of [[nanoparticles]], significantly smaller than the width of a human hair, aimed at attacking cancer by locating and “latching on” to tumors. Used in conjunction with [[magnetic resonance imaging]], the nanoparticles could help physicians monitor cancerous tissue and deliver medicine directly to the tumor, not to the rest of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Nanoparticles used to track cells | newspaper = UPI | date = 27 July 2007 | url = http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2007/03/27/Nanoparticles-used-to-track-cells/UPI-90741175008534/ | accessdate = 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2006 — Photoacoustic imaging'''

* Lihong Wang, Ph.D., announces his work on [[photoacoustic imaging]], a new technique that uses light and sound to create detailed, color pictures of tumors and organs. The noninvasive imaging technique, which can be performed without the dangers of radiation exposure associated with [[X-ray]] and [[CT scans]], also may help doctors detect cancer earlier than ever before, its developers say.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Lihong Wang, Ph.D. | title = New technique brings cancer screening into sharper focus | medium = Web news | publisher = Reuters | location = St. Louis | date = 30 April 2012 | url = https://www.reuters.com/video/2012/04/30/new-technique-brings-cancer-screening-in?videoId=234198822 | accessdate = 25 June 2012}}ß&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2003 — Breast cancer'''

* Thalachallour Mohanakumar, Ph.D., and other researchers at Siteman develop and test on mice a prototype vaccine that causes cancerous tumors to stop growing, then to shrink. The vaccine, which is being developed to fight breast cancer in humans, helps the immune system target a protein found in 80 percent of breast tumors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Breast cancer vaccine ready for tests soon | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph | date = 10 March 2005 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/3315963/Breast-cancer-vaccine-ready-for-tests-soon.html | accessdate = 15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2001 — Imaging and the immune system’s role in controlling cancer'''

* Research led by Joanne Mortimer, M.D., shows that [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scans can often identify within two weeks which women with advanced breast cancer are likely to respond to [[hormone therapy]], a gentler alternative to chemotherapy that is usually just as effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hesman | first = Tina | title = Scan test may aid choice for breast cancer therapy | newspaper = St. Louis Post-Dispatch | location = St. Louis | pages = C5 | date = 15 June 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1998 — Biopsies'''

* Ralph G. Dacey Jr., M.D., performs the world's first magnetic [[stereotactic surgery]] to biopsy a human brain tumor using an indirect route to the tumor. The route is designed to avoid regions that would normally be entered when a surgeon manually inserts a surgical tool straight at a site. The investigational computerized system allows surgeons to carefully manipulate surgical tools inside the brain through the use of a catheter driven by precisely controlled magnetic fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = First magnet-controlled brain surgery performed | newspaper = BBC News | date = 23 December 1998 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/241244.stm | accessdate = 13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1994 — Genetic screening test for thyroid cancer'''

* Led in part by Helen Donis-Keller, Ph.D., researchers for the first time develop genetic screening tests that detect a rare, lethal form of [[thyroid cancer]] in the preclinical state, permitting early treatment in children predisposed to the disease. It was the first surgical prevention of cancer based on genetic test results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Signor | first = Roger | title = WU Surgeons Remove Gland, Cancer Threat | newspaper = St. Louis Post-Dispatch | location = St. Louis, Missouri | pages = 1A | date = 29 June 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1979 — Bone marrow transplants'''

* As part of a clinical trial, [[leukemia]] patients at Washington University in St. Louis and four other medical centers receive transplants of their healthy bone marrow cells to determine how effective the procedure is in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation treatment. The new technique would later be called autologous [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Leukemia Victims Get Own Marrow In Transplants | newspaper = The Washington Post | location = Washington, D.C. | pages = A9 | date = 24 August 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:asahia.JPG|thumb|right|300px|People performing Asahi in a park.]]

'''''Asahi''''' (or ''Asahi Health'') is a Finnish health exercise based on the eastern traditions of [[T'ai chi ch'uan]], [[qigong]], [[yiquan]] and [[yoga]], with a western scientific viewpoint. Asahi is designed to suit everybody, regardless of physical condition or age. 

Asahi exercise is taught and performed in instructed groups, but Asahi can also be performed alone as a form of daily self-treatment. Asahi exercise is ideal for short breaks.

==The History of Asahi==

Asahi was created  in [[Finland]] 2004 by professional sports instructors and martial artists Timo Klemola, Ilpo Jalamo, Keijo Mikkonen and Yrjö Mähönen. They all had high regards towards classical body development techniques such as [[karate]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan]], [[yiquan]] and [[yoga]], but these styles, as rewarding as they are, seemed to attract only a small marginal of the Finnish population. 

These classical styles are quite complex and therefore may have a high starting level. They use concepts such as [[qi]] and [[prana]], which may seem mystical to western people.

The purpose of Asahi was to get the best out of these techniques, put it in the most simplified form, make it overall scientific and turn it into an easily approachable form - a health exercise for everybody with no starting level at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.6d.fi/folder.2006-09-27.0655303114/page.2006-10-25.5371365665/view?searchterm=asahi SixDegrees article Asahi - Designed for Health]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 2006-09-27&lt;/ref&gt; 

Asahi is designed to treat and prevent shoulder- and back problems, fractures due to falling down and stress-related psychosomatic problems.

==The Principles of Asahi==

Asahi is a series of slow movements, completed in silence. It looks harmonious and beautiful, a bit like [[qigong]].

The basic six principles of Asahi are:

1. The linking of movement and breath&lt;br /&gt;
2. Practicing vertically erect body alignment&lt;br /&gt;
3. Whole body movement&lt;br /&gt;
4. Listening to the slow motion&lt;br /&gt;
5. Cultivating the mind with mental images&lt;br /&gt;
6. The exercise as a continual, flowing experience&lt;br /&gt;

The Asahi movements are soft and performed in the rhythm of breathing. The series is simple and easy to learn. The movements have also a practical function, for example picking up a ball from the floor or improving one’s balance by standing on one foot. Advanced levels are designed for long-term trainees, yet they are equally simple to learn.

==Distribution==
Asahi can be practiced in major areas of Finland. Asahi Health Ltd has also been accepted as an Education Partner to [[Federation of International Sports, Aerobics and Fitness]] as the first Body Mind -product to be recognized and recommended by this organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.asahi.fi/index.php?id=26 |title=Asahi Health homepages - Asahi International |access-date=2008-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004124026/http://www.asahi.fi/index.php?id=26 |archive-date=2011-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of several reasons why cherophobia may develop is the belief that when one becomes [[Happiness|happy]], a negative event will soon occur that will taint that happiness, as if punishing that individual for satisfaction. This belief is thought to be more prevalent in [[eastern_world|Eastern]] cultures. In [[Western cultures]], such as [[American culture]], "it is almost taken for granted that happiness is one of the most important values guiding people's [[personal life | lives]]".  Western cultures are more driven by an urge to maximize happiness and to minimize sadness. Failing to appear happy often gives cause for concern. The value placed on happiness echoes through Western [[positive psychology]] and through research on subjective well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.springer.com/about+springer/media/springer+select?SGWID=0-11001-6-1457741-0 |title= What's so bad about feeling happy? |date= 17 March 2014 |author= Joan Robinson |publisher= Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fear of happiness is associated with fragility of happiness beliefs, suggesting that one of the causes of aversion to happiness may be the belief that happiness is unstable and fragile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-014-9553-0|title= Fragility of Happiness Beliefs Across 15 National Groups|first1= Mohsen|last1= Joshanloo|first2= Dan|last2= Weijers|first3= Ding-Yu|last3= Jiang|first4= Gyuseog|last4= Han|first5= Jaechang|last5= Bae|first6= Joyce S.|last6= Pang|first7= Lok Sang|last7= Ho|first8= Maria Cristina|last8= Ferreira|first9= Melikşah|last9= Demir|first10= Muhammad|last10= Rizwan|first11= Imran Ahmed|last11= Khilji|first12= Mustapha|last12= Achoui|first13= Ryosuke|last13= Asano|first14= Tasuku|last14= Igarashi|first15= Saori|last15= Tsukamoto|first16= Sanne M.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural factors==
There are four major reasons why cherophobes avoid happiness: "believing that being happy will provoke bad things to happen; that happiness will make you a worse person; that expressing happiness is bad for you and others; and that pursuing happiness is bad for you and others".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=It's time for Western psychology to recognise that many individuals, and even entire cultures, fear happiness |url=http://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/its-time-for-western-psychology-to.html |publisher=[[The British Psychological Society]] |date=21 July 2014 |accessdate=October 4, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "some people—in Western and Eastern cultures—are wary of happiness because they believe that bad things, such as unhappiness, suffering, and death, tend to happen to happy people."&lt;ref name="livescience44233"&gt;{{citation |title=Why Happiness Scares Us |author=Stephanie Pappas |url=http://www.livescience.com/44233-fear-of-happiness.html |publisher=[[LiveScience]] |date=20 March 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings "call into question the notion that happiness is the ultimate goal, a belief echoed in any number of articles and [[self-help]] publications about whether certain choices are likely to make you happy".&lt;ref name="livescience44233"/&gt; Also, "in cultures that believe worldly happiness to be associated with sin, shallowness, and moral decline will actually feel less satisfied when their lives are (by other standards) going well",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=13 of Psychology’s Newest and Coolest Ideas |author=Susan Krauss Whitbourne |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201304/13-psychology-s-newest-and-coolest-ideas |publisher=[[Psychology Today]] |date=6 April 2013 |accessdate=4 October 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so measures of personal happiness cannot simply be considered a yardstick for satisfaction with one's life, and attitudes such as aversion to happiness have important implications for measuring happiness across cultures and ranking nations on [[Happiness economics|happiness scores]].

'''Caetextia''' (from the Latin word ''caecus'', meaning "blind" and ''contextus'', meaning "context") is a term and concept first coined by psychologists [[Joe Griffin (psychologist)|Joe Griffin]] and [[Ivan Tyrrell]] to describe a chronic disorder that manifests as a context blindness in people on the autism spectrum. It was specifically used to designate the most dominant manifestation of autistic behavior in higher-functioning individuals. Griffin and Tyrell also suggested that caetextia "is a more accurate and descriptive term for this inability to see how one variable influences another, particularly at the higher end of the spectrum, than the label of 'Asperger's syndrome'".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caetextia.com/pages/brain.html|title=Caetextia: a new definition of autistic and Asperger's behaviour|website=www.caetextia.com|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who suffer from caetextia often experience elevated levels of frustration, anger, and anxiety when faced with a situation that requires giving attention to more than one interacting variable or factor at a time. This can be attributed to the inability to unconsciously draw upon the contextual information presented in a given situation as well as evaluate the significance of change with regards to the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Caetextia can also exist in a temporary form prompted by stress, anxiety, or depression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Caetextia in Autism and Asperger's ==
Many of the symptoms observed in patients with [[Asperger syndrome|Asperger's]] can be attributed to caetextia. In order for someone to be considered contextually aware, they must be able to attach attention to and detach it from the interacting variables in a given situation. This implies active integration of sensory information gathered from the situation. It has been found that patients differ in their ability to perform these functions based on the dominant hemisphere of their brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/psycinfo/docview/1660462782/A1830FB8FC82480APQ/1?accountid=14709|title=We seem to have encountered a problem. - ProQuest|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Context blindness has been speculated as having a relationship with other prominent neurocognitive theories of [[Autism-spectrum disorder|Autism Spectrum Disorder]] (ASD) such as [[theory of mind]], [[Empathizing–systemizing theory|empathizing-systemizing]], and [[Executive functions|executive function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vermeulen|first=Peter|date=April 2014|title=Context Blindness in Autism Spectrum Disorder|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1088357614528799|journal=SAGE|volume=30|pages=182–192|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
Acting Mayor Paolo Duterte of [[Davao City]] ordered an urgent investigation on July 10 regarding the matter to determine the exact cause of the candy poisoning incident.&lt;ref name=probe&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caduaya|first1=Editha|title=Acting Davao mayor orders probe into durian candy poisoning|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/98995-davao-mayor-orders-probe-durian-candy-poisoning|accessdate=14 July 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2015, the [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]] in the Caraga declared a food poisoning outbreak in the region.&lt;ref name=outbreak/&gt; Hospitals across the Caraga Region were put into white alert in response to the poisoning incident.&lt;ref name=fdatest/&gt;

==Investigation==
===Tainted candy===
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has traced the tainted candies' origin to two manufacturing facilities in [[Davao City]]. The FDA has linked two candy manufacturers to the poisoning incident based on labels found on the food products, one which is licensed with the food safety authority and the other manufacturer, Wendy's Durian Candies is not in the database of the FDA.&lt;ref name=dav2k/&gt;&lt;ref name=duriansorry/&gt;

Janet Aquino of Wendy's Durian Candies said the candies were apparently repacked when she saw the candies made by her company in news report. She noted that the candies' packages included a cut-up portions of the original label of the products.

The FDA has also conducted a Microbiological tests on the samples of the tainted candies and is suspecting that the candies were contaminated by [[E. Coli]], [[Salmonella]] or staphylococcus based on the reported symptoms by victims of the food poisoning incident.&lt;ref name=fdatest&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dioquino|first1=Rose-An Jessica|title=Salmonella eyed in durian candy poisoning in Surigao del Sur|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/521278/news/regions/salmonella-eyed-in-durian-candy-poisoning-in-surigao-del-sur|accessdate=14 July 2015|publisher=GMA News|date=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press conference on June 16, 2015, announced that the candy samples were tested positive for ''[[staphylococcus aureus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alvarez|first1=Kathrina Charmaine|title=‘Poisonous’ durian candies test positive for staphylococcus bacteria|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/523454/news/regions/poisonous-durian-candies-test-positive-for-staphylococcus-bacteria|accessdate=22 July 2015|agency=Agence France-Presse, JDS, GMA News|publisher=GMA News|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linked companies===
One of the linked manufacturers to the poisoning incident was Wendy’s Durian Candies. Janet Aquino, whose family runs the manufacturing firm, admitted that her company made the candies linked to the poisonings. However she added that the repacking of the candies by the distributors might be the cause of the poisonings. The Davao City government has suspended the business permit of Wendy's Durian Candies until the business secure a clearance from the FDA.&lt;ref name=dav2k/&gt; Wendy Aquino, owner of the business, has apologized for the incident in behalf of the company.&lt;ref name=duriansorry&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caduaya|first1=Editha|title='Sorry,' says durian candymaker over poisoning incident|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/99071-durian-candy-maker-poisoning-apology|accessdate=14 July 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrests===
Nine men and women linked to the poisonings were arrested.&lt;ref name=fdatest/&gt; The arrested were identified as vendors; Junnil Martinez, John Oben, Joel Pasa, Richard Rivera Jr, Martinez Bocaycay, Genelyn Pasa, Junnel Teriote, John Dequilla, Henryto Amogui and three more people whose names were not disclosed.&lt;ref name=duriansorry/&gt;

Pasa, 26, and Amoguis 21, from Davao City and Valencia, Bukidnon respectively, were seen selling the tainted durian, mango and mangosteen flavored candies at the Special Education Elementary School in [[Tandag]]. The same vendors were also believed to have sold the candies in Aras-Arasan in [[Cagwait]] and [[Carrascal]].&lt;ref name=probe/&gt;

One of those arrested is named John Dequilla, who had been client of Wendy's Durian Candies for at least two years. Janet Aquino, representing the candy manufacturer, said that Dequilla ordered 300 bags of 100-piece packs of candies in July 7 to be delivered in [[Tandag]] in [[Surigao del Sur]]. Aquino noted that it was the first time Dequilla asked for the candies to be delivered in Tandag.&lt;ref name=duriansorry/&gt;

The '''Center for Personalized Education for Physicians''' ('''CPEP''') is a [[non-profit organization]], headquartered in [[Denver, Colorado]], and it specializes in [[physician]] competency assessment and educational intervention. The organization was established in 1990 as a collaborative effort of seven [[Colorado]] healthcare organizations: the Colorado Alliance for CME, the Colorado Foundation for Medical Care, the Colorado Hospital Association, the [[Colorado Medical Society]], the Colorado Physician Health Program, the Colorado Society of [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|Osteopathic Medicine]] and the [[University of Colorado School of Medicine]].

CPEP provides assessment and education for physicians re-entering practice. Its approach is based on the idea that education should be directed by an evaluation of the individual's educational needs and that traditional continuing medical education conferences alone may not be effective in improving practice.&lt;ref name=Competency /&gt;  This is consistent with the approach of remediation programs both in the United States and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physician Characteristics and Distribution in the U.S.|publisher=American Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians take part in CPEP programs for medical ethics education and training, to address performance evaluation issues and concerns, and to help them reinstate their medical licenses.

CPEP collaborates with the University of Colorado Schoolof Medicine and is led by faculty and other physician consultants who are board certified in their respective specialties. CPEP is one of five programs nationwide that have been accepted as members of the [http://cpe.memberlodge.org/ Coalition for Physician Enhancement], the primary U.S. organization representing programs that provide physician assessment and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpe.memberlodge.org/Default.aspx?pageId=1213244 |publisher=Coalition for Physician Enhancement |title=About Coalition for Physician Enhancement (CPE) |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

CPEP receives no funding from [[Medical license|medical licensure fees]] or state sources. Instead, the organization is supported by participant fees and donations from the Colorado medical community, including the COPIC Companies. 

'''Assessment Testing'''

Doctors are referred to CPEP for competency assessments&lt;ref name="Competency" /&gt; from different organizations, including [[hospital]]s, medical groups and state medical boards. The CPEP approach to physician competency evaluation and assessment has three major components: clinical competence assessment, educational intervention, and post-educational evaluation. 

The assessment is individualized based on the physician’s practice and the concerns of the referring organization.&lt;ref name="Cognitive" /&gt; The actual assessment includes structured clinical interviews, simulated patient encounters and written testing. This testing is overseen by a [[board-certified]] physician who acts as an associate medical director (AMD). This AMD then compiles a final report, and the physician receives recommendations for education based on their needs.

'''ProBE'''

The ProBE (Professional/Problem-Based Ethics) Program&lt;ref name="Probe" /&gt; started in 1992 in [[New Jersey]] as collaboration between the New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners and The Ethics Group, LLC. The program started as a way to provide educational intervention to physicians who were identified by the Board and had received ethical infractions. 
 
By 1996, the ProBE Program had been endorsed by 45 licensing boards and sub-specialty boards throughout the [[United States]]. In 2007, CPEP acquired The Ethics Group, LLC, and began offering the program.

The ProBE Program provides education for healthcare professionals, and it focuses on [[ethics]] violations and unprofessional conduct secondary to boundary violations in the practice of healthcare. These violations can include financial irregularities, [[misrepresentation]], [[sexual misconduct]], disruptive behavior and [[substance abuse]]. The class is offered in Denver, Colorado and [[Newark, New Jersey]] in the United States, and [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].

'''Other Programs'''

CPEP offers a Clinical Practice Reentry Program&lt;ref name="Reentry1" /&gt; for physicians who wish to reenter the field after a voluntary absence to enhance a physician's practice, and/or restore a physician's clinical capabilities. This program evaluates the physician’s clinical skills, including structured clinical interviews and a one-day comprehensive evaluation.&lt;ref name="Reentry4" /&gt; Physicians are then given a reentry plan, which includes supervised clinical experience to update skills and knowledge and a detailed reporting of progress.&lt;ref name="Reentry3" /&gt; To enter this program, physicians must have left the medical field in good standing, and they must want to reenter in the same [[clinical practice]] for which they were trained.&lt;ref name="Reentry2" /&gt;

The Patient Care Documentation Seminar teaches physicians how to identify basic documentation guidelines, understand the legal issues associated with poor documentation and overcome barriers to good documentation. Physicians can receive up to eight [[continuing medical education]] credits and up to two Experience Rating System  points for taking the class.

The Personalized Implementation Program is the follow-up class to the Patient Care Documentation Seminar. Physicians submit three sets of charts to CPEP at two, four and six months, and they receive feedback via checklists from a [[Consultant (medicine)|medical consultant]] on their progress at two and four months. Physicians then contact CPEP for a telephone conference with a medical reviewer and receive a final report of their progress after the last chart is submitted.

The '''Centre of Biological Research''' (Spanish: '''Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas''') is a leading research centre in [[Spain]], specialising in [[molecular genetics]]. It belongs to the [[Spanish National Research Council]] (CSIC). 

Created in 1958, the centre leads Spanish and European research in the fields of biology and biomedicine. Set up under the auspices of [[Nobel laureate]] [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]], its first director was [[Gregorio Marañon]]. Leading scientists associated with the centre include [[Mariano Barbacid]].

Originally located in the centre of [[Madrid]], its new facilities at the [[Complutense University of Madrid]] campus were inaugurated on 26 January 2004 by Her Royal Highness [[Infanta Cristina, Duchess of Palma de Mallorca]].

== Research areas ==
The centre is divided into five departments corresponding to the scientific areas they specialise in: 
*[[Cellular biology|Cellular]] and [[developmental biology]]
*[[Plant biology]]
*[[Protein science]]
*[[Cellular physiopathology|Cellular]] and [[molecular physiopathology]]
*[[Molecular microbiology]]

With 90 staff scientists and some 500 pre-and postdoctoral research fellows, technical and administrative staff, it has a high output in leading English-and Spanish language scientific reviews.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6368">[[File:Radiograph of impacted wisdom tooth near nerve.jpg|thumb|Wisdom tooth with close association to the inferior alveolar nerve.]]
When extracting lower wisdom teeth, '''Coronectomy''' is a treatment option involving removing the crown of the lower wisdom tooth, whilst keeping the roots in place in healthy patients. This option is given to patients as an alternative to extraction when the wisdom teeth are in close association with the inferior alveolar nerve, and so used to prevent damage to the nerve which may occur during extraction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Advantages ==

Prevents potential [[neuropathy]]&lt;ref name="SarwarMahmood-Rao2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sarwar|first1=Humera|last2=Mahmood-Rao|first2=Sameer|title=Coronectomy; good or bad?|journal=Dental Update|volume=42|issue=9|year=2015|pages=824–828|issn=0305-5000|doi=10.12968/denu.2015.42.9.824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of altered sensation is significantly lower than convention surgical removal of [[mandibular]] third [[molars]] with 8% of the cases affected temporarily and 3.6% of the cases got permanently affected. 
30% of the roots will migrate post-coronectomy, erupting away for the inferior alveolar canal. This makes extraction of the remaining roots safer.

== Disadvantages ==

There is a 5% chance of failure of coronectomy, the root will become mobilized during transection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Riordan, Brian C.|title=Coronectomy (intentional partial odontectomy of lower third molars)|journal=Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology, Oral Radiology and Endodontics|date=September 2004|volume=98|issue=3|pages=274, 280|doi=10.1016/j.tripleo.2003.12.040|pmid=15356463}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 5% of the cases, [[Dental follicle|follicle]] remnants will form deep [[periodontal]] pockets which will lead to infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Riordan, Brian C.|title=Coronectomy (intentional partial odontectomy of lower third molars)|journal=Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology, Oral Radiology and Endodontics|date=September 2004|volume=98|issue=3|pages=274, 280|doi=10.1016/j.tripleo.2003.12.040|pmid=15356463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indications ==

Coronectomy should be considered if there are signs that the patient is at a high risk of nerve damage during extraction:
* Lower wisdom tooth is shown to be close to the inferior alveolar canal radiographically:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224005111_Notes_on_coronectomy|title=Notes on coronectomy|last=Renton|first=Tara|date=2012-04-13|volume=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Signs of narrowing or diversion of the canal
** Roots are darkened/ Canal is interrupted
** Interruption of [[lamina dura]] 
** Juxta-apical region on the [[radiograph]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=T. Renton|title=Notes on coronectomy|journal=BDJ|date=13 April 2012|issue=212|pages=323, 326|doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.2012.265}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Not medically compromised&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Tooth vital, caries/pathology free and non-mobile&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Contraindications ==

* Non-vital tooth 
* Tooth is mobile or becomes mobile during procedure 
* Tooth is horizontal or distoangular impacted 
* Medically compromised patients for example immunocompromised 
* Patients who are predisposed to local infection for example if they have undergone radiotherapy in the area they may have poor healing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Caries or persistent infection&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Procedure ==

=== Preoperative assessment ===

==== The patient ====
The patient should be aware of the potential risks of the procedure such as:
* [[Alveolar osteitis|Dry socket]]
* Secondary surgical procedures

==== Radiography ====
A plain film radiograph allows the proximity of the tooth to the [[Inferior alveolar nerve|inferior alveolar canal]] to be assessed. The plain film can be assessed to identify the tooth as high risk If there is; loss of the lamina dura, darkening of the canal and grooving of the root. If the mandibular third molar is deemed to be high risk, a cone beam CT ([[Cone beam computed tomography|CBCT]]) is taken in addition to the plain film. The justification of additional radiography can be justified by the surgeon as it allows them to gain further information regarding the tooth roots and the inferior alveolar canal should the roots be mobilised when transecting.

==== Consent ====
Verbal consent must be attained by the surgeon prior to the procedure of a coronectomy. Additionally consent must be gained if removal of the roots is required due to mobilisation. The patient should be informed of early and late infection meaning the roots may need removing.

=== Operative technique ===
# Long buccal infiltration and anterior buccal infiltration both with 4% [[articaine]], 1:10000ppm of epinephrine. This can be supplemented with an inferior dental block using 2% lidocaine, 1:80000 epinephrine.
# The third molar is exposed by raising a buccal triangular mucoperiosteal fold thickness flap.
# A fissure bur is used to create a buccal gutter of bone and to expose the ACJ.
# Drill directly into pulp at intersection of buccal groove and ACJ.
# This cut is lateralised to create a horizontal groove below the level of the ACJ.
# The crown can be fractured off the roots using a small elevator such as coupland number 1 or straight Warwick James.
# Care must be taken to not apply too much torque to the tooth so minimising root mobilisation. 
# Use a rose head bur to remove enamel fragments.
# Remaining roots should sit a few millimetres below the alveolar crystal bone level, where the pulp should not be touched.
# Then follow up with closing the area and suturing.
# Post operative [[Chlorhexidine|chlorohexidine]] mouth wash or gel can be prescribed, however antibiotics should not be prescribed unless there is pericoronal infection. 

=== Post operative complications ===

==== Early ====
If the patient presents with dry socket, irrigate with chlorohexidine mouthwash and place resorbable dressing such as Alvogyl. If the patient has recurrent infection, consideration to remove the roots should be noted.

==== Late ====
In a few cases the remaining roots may erupt which can minimise the morbidity of the inferior alveolar nerve, however the roots may be in close contact to the inferior alveolar nerve requiring surgical separation. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Rock art by [[Indigenous Australians]] from the Upper Yule River, [[Pilbara]], Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=C. |year=1995 |title=Blood relations: Menstruation and the origins of Culture |location=London &amp; New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |page=443}} Re-drawn after {{cite book |last=Wright |first=B.

'''Culture and menstruation''' is about cultural aspects surrounding how society views [[menstruation]]. A "menstrual taboo" is any social [[taboo]] concerned with [[menstruation]]. In some societies it involves menstruation being perceived as unclean or embarrassing, inhibiting even the mention of menstruation whether in public (in the media and [[advertising]]) or in private (among friends, in the household, or with men). Many traditional religions consider menstruation [[ritually unclean]], although anthropologists point out that the concepts 'sacred' and 'unclean' may be intimately connected.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1963. [1898] La prohibition de l’inceste et ses origines. ''L’Année Sociologique'' 1: 1-70. Reprinted as ''Incest. The nature and origin of the taboo'', trans. E. Sagarin. New York: Stuart.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different cultures view menstruation in different ways. The basis of many conduct norms and communication about menstruation in western industrial societies is the belief that menstruation should remain hidden.&lt;ref&gt;Laws, S. (1990). ''Issues of Blood: The Politics of Menstruation''. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in many hunter-gatherer societies, particularly in Africa, menstrual observances are viewed in a positive light, without any connotation of uncleanness.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, C. M. 1960. The Elima: a premarital festival among the Bambuti Pygmies. ''Zaïre'' 14: 175-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Mythology==

The word "[[menstruation]]" is etymologically related to "moon". The terms "menstruation" and "menses" are derived from the [[Latin]] ''mensis'' (month), which in turn relates to the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''mene'' (moon) and to the roots of the English words ''month'' and ''moon''.&lt;ref name="Allen, Kevin 2007 239"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Reluctant Hypothesis: A History of Discourse Surrounding the Lunar Phase Method of Regulating Conception|author=Allen, Kevin|publisher=Lacuna Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-9510974-2-7|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the anthropologists Buckley and Gottlieb, cross-cultural study shows that, while taboos about menstruation are nearly universal, and while many of these involve notions of uncleanliness, numerous menstrual traditions "bespeak quite different, even opposite, purposes and meanings."&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, T., and Gottlieb, A., eds. (1988). ''Blood Magic: The Anthropology of Menstruation''. Berkeley: University of California Press. (p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt; In some traditional societies, menstrual rituals are experienced by women as protective and empowering, offering [[women-only space|women a space set apart]] from the [[male gaze]] and from unwanted sexual or domestic pressures and demands.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, T. 1988. Menstruation and the power of Yurok women. In T. Buckley and A. Gottlieb (eds), ''Blood Magic. The anthropology of menstruation.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 187-209.&lt;/ref&gt;

An instructive example is provided by the anthropologist Wynne Maggi, who describes the communal ''bashali'' (large menstrual house) of women in the [[Kalasha Valley]] (northwestern Pakistan) as their 'most holy place', respected by men, and serving as women's all-female organizing centre for establishing and maintaining gender solidarity and power.&lt;ref&gt;W. Maggi, 2001. ''Our Women are Free. Gender and Ethnicity in the Hindukush.''  Michigan: University of Michigan Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to one body of cultural evolutionary scholarship, the idea that menstrual blood marks the body as periodically sacred was initially established by female coalitions in their own interests, although later, with the rise of cattle-ownership and patriarchal power, these same beliefs and taboos were harnessed by religious patriarchs to intensify women's oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 1995. ''Blood Relations: Menstruation and the origins of culture.'' New Haven &amp; London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Metaformic Theory]], as proposed by cultural theorist [[Judy Grahn]] and others, places menstruation as a central organizing idea in the creation of culture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metaformia.org/articles/emergence-of-metaformic-consciousness/|title=The Emergence of Metaformic Consciousness|website=www.metaformia.org|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the formation of humans' earliest rituals.

===Synchronisation with the moon===
Menstruation in synchrony with the moon is widely assumed in myths and traditions as a ritual ideal.&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Chris |year=1988 |chapter=Menstrual Synchrony and the Australian Rainbow Snake |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=YvxLmta7Yb0C&amp;pg=PA232 |editor1-first=Thomas C. T. |editor1-last=Buckley |editor2-first=Alma |editor2-last=Gottlieb |title=Blood Magic: The Anthropology of Menstruation |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |pages=232–55 |isbn=978-0-520-06350-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lévi-Strauss"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lévi-Strauss |first=Claude |year=1978 |title=The Origin of Table Manners |chapter=Introduction to a Science of Mythology |location=London |publisher=Cape |pages=221–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that menstruation is—or ideally ought to be—in harmony with wider cosmic rhythms is one of the most tenacious ideas central to the myths and rituals of traditional communities across the world. One of the most thoroughgoing analyses of primitive mythology ever undertaken was that of the French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], who concluded that, taken together, the indigenous myths of North and South America expressed men's worry that, unless women's periods were carefully monitored and synchronised, the universe might descend into chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, C. 1978. ''The Origin of Table Manners. Introduction to a Science of Mythology'' 3. London: Cape.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Aboriginal Australia, the supernatural being known as the 'Rainbow Snake' has been interpreted as, among other things, an indigenous way of conceptualising the ideal of synchronised tidal, lunar, menstrual and seasonal periodicities whose overall harmony (it is believed) confers spiritual power and fertility.&lt;ref name="Knight" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maddock |first=K. |year=1978 |chapter=Introduction |editor1-first=I. A. |editor1-last=Buchler |editor2-first=K. |editor2-last=Maddock |title=The Rainbow Serpent |location=The Hague |publisher=Mouton}}{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maddock |first=K. |year=1978 |chapter=Metaphysics in a mythical view of the world |editor1-first=I. A. |editor1-last=Buchler |editor2-first=K. |editor2-last=Maddock |title=The Rainbow Serpent |location=The Hague |publisher=Mouton |pages=99–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To many, such [[culture|cultural]] associations appear persuasive in view of the fact that in humans, the menstrual cycle quite closely approximates the moon's 29.5-day synodic cycle, unlike in chimpanzees (~36 days) or bonobos (~40 days).&lt;ref&gt;Martin, R. D. 1992. Female cycles in relation to paternity in primate societies. In R. D. Martin, A. F. Dixson and E. J. Wickings (eds), ''Paternity in Primates. Genetic tests and theories.''

Lopez (eds), ''Hormones and Reproduction of Vertebrates,'' Vol. 5, Mammals. London: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical information from hunter gatherers is lacking, but where large-scale western studies focus on women's peak reproductive years—removing outlier values—the cycle length gravitates around 29.1–29.5 days, while the figure for women in their thirties shortens toward 28 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Treloar|first1=A.

===Sacred and powerful===
[[File:Angola Yombe Nagelfigur Linden-Museum 35627.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Angolan ([[Yombe people|Yombe]]) fetish to regulate menstruation.]]
In some historic cultures, a menstruating woman was considered [[sacred]] and powerful,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kpX4fdBXz64C&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=power+of+menstrual+blood#v=onepage&amp;q=power+of+menstrual+blood&amp;f=false|title=Magic in the Roman World: Pagans, Jews and Christians|first=Naomi|last=Janowitz|date=1 June 2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203457641}}&lt;/ref&gt; with increased [[psychic]] abilities, and strong enough to heal the sick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1LAL2MzfOEC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=menstruation+as+powerful#v=onepage&amp;q=menstruation+as+powerful&amp;f=false|title=The Joy of Family Rituals: Recipes for Everyday Living|first=Barbara|last=Biziou|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|via=Google Books|isbn=9781616405748}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Cherokee]], menstrual blood was a source of feminine strength and had the power to destroy enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VuiKdvbF5_sC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=power+of+menstrual+blood#v=onepage&amp;q=power+of+menstrual+blood&amp;f=false|title=Blood Politics: Race, Culture, and Identity in the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma|first=Circe Dawn|last=Sturm|date=20 March 2002|publisher=University of California Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780520936089}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Rome]], [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote that a [[menstruating]] woman who uncovers her body can scare away [[hailstorms]], whirlwinds and lightning. If she strips naked and walks around the field, caterpillars, worms and beetles fall off the ears of corn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5QVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA262&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=hailstorms+whirlwinds+and+lightnings+will+even+be+scared+away+by+a+woman+uncovering+her+body#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Natural History|author=[[Pliny the Younger]]|chapter=xxviii. c.23|year=1894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menstrual blood is viewed as especially dangerous to men's power.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xPppvOWZ2t8C&amp;pg=PA129 ''Exploring Gypsiness: Power, Exchange and Interdependence in a Transylvanian''], by Ada I. Engebrigtsen, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Africa]], menstrual blood is used in the most powerful [[Magic (paranormal)|magic charms]] in order to both [[Ritual purification|purify]] and destroy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zaSgMk31I-cC&amp;pg=PA226 ''Iron, Gender, and Power: Rituals of Transformation in African Societies''], by Eugenia W. Herbert, p.&amp;nbsp;226.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mayan mythology explains the origin of menstruation as a punishment for violating the social rules governing marital alliance. The menstrual blood turns into snakes and insects used in black sorcery, before the [[Maya moon goddess]] is reborn from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Braakhuis|first1=H.E.M.|year=2005|title=Xbalanque's Canoe. The Origin of Poison in Q'eqchi'-Mayan Hummingbird Myth|url=|journal=Anthropos|volume=100|issue=|pages=175–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where women's blood is considered sacred, the belief is that it should be ritually set apart. According to this logic, it is when sacred blood comes into contact with profane things that it becomes experienced as ritually dangerous or 'unclean'.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1965 [1912]. ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life.'' New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==
The sociological theorist [[Emile Durkheim]] argued that human religion in its entirety emerged originally in connection with menstruation. His argument was that a certain kind of action – collective ritual action – could establish simultaneously totemism, law, exogamy and kinship in addition to distinctively human language and thought. Everything began, according to Durkheim, when a flow of blood periodically ruptured relations between the sexes. 'All blood is terrible', he observed,&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1963. [1898] La prohibition de l'inceste et ses origines. ''L'Année Sociologique'' 1: 1-70. Reprinted as Incest. The nature and origin of the taboo, trans. E. Sagarin. New York: Stuart.&lt;/ref&gt; 'and all sorts of taboos are instituted to prevent contact with it'. During menstruation, females would exercise a 'type of repulsing action which keeps the other sex far from them'. This same blood was thought to run through the veins of women and animals alike, suggesting the blood's ultimate origin in 'totemic'—part-human, part-animal—ancestral beings. Once menstrual blood had been linked with the blood of the hunt, it became logically possible for a hunter to respect certain animals as if they were his kin, this being the essence of '[[totemism]]'. Within the group's shared blood resided its 'god' or 'totem', 'from which it follows that the blood is a divine thing. When it runs out, the god is spilling over'.

=== Buddhism ===
In Buddhism ([[Theravada]] or [[Hinayana]]) menstruation is viewed as "''a natural physical excretion that women have to go through on a monthly basis, nothing more or less''". However, in certain branches of Japanese Buddhism,  menstruating women are banned from attending temples.&lt;ref name="WBR4-Jnanavira"&gt;{{Citation|author=Dharmacari Jnanavira|title=A Mirror for Women? Reflections of the Feminine in Japanese Buddhism|url=http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol4/mirror_for_women.html|journal=Western Buddhist Review|volume=4|postscript=.|accessdate=28 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Nichiren Buddhism (Japan) menstruation is not considered a spiritual obstacle to religious practice, although a menstruating woman may choose not to bow, for comfort.&lt;ref&gt;Toshie Kurihara (not dated) [http://www.iop.or.jp/Documents/0313/kurihara.pdf A History of Women in Japanese Buddhism: Nichiren’s Perspectives on the Enlightenment of Women]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
Most Christian denominations do not follow any specific rituals or rules related to menstruation. Some denominations follow the rules laid out in the [[Holiness Code]] section of Leviticus, somewhat similar to the [[Jewish]] [[ritual]] of [[Niddah]].

Some church fathers defended the exclusion of women from ministry based on a notion of uncleanness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Women were considered ritually unclean | url=http://www.womenpriests.org/traditio/unclean.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others held that purity laws should be discarded as part of the Old Covenant.&lt;ref&gt;R. Hugh Connolly, [http://www.bombaxo.com/didascalia.html &lt;nowiki&gt;''Didascalia Apostolorum''&lt;/nowiki&gt;]. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1929.  Retrieved on 18 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Orthodox church ====
Some Christian denominations, including many authorities of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and some parts of the Oriental Orthodox Church (also known as the Russian, Ukrainian, Greek, and Indian Orthodox Church), distinct from the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Church, advise women not to receive communion during their menstrual period.&lt;ref name="OCIC-Menses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/menses.aspx|title=Menstruation, Emissions, and Holy Communion|author=Patrick Barnes|publisher=Orthodox Christian Information Center|accessdate=2 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative/traditionalist members of the [[Orthodox Church]] observe the ancient practice of abstaining from [[Holy Communion]] during menstruation.&lt;ref name="OCIC-Menses" /&gt;
This is a fairly common practice throughout [[Greece]] and [[Russia]] and other historically Orthodox Christian countries. However, in most non-Orthodox countries—especially in Europe and North America—a sizable majority of women do not practice this ancient rule, although a minority of women still do. In fact, many Orthodox Christian women are unaware of the ancient practice of abstaining from Holy Communion due to menstruation, or merely view it as an "old wives' tale". Many Orthodox Christians in Non-Orthodox countries are advised to disregard this practice, as it is seen as an excuse to not participate in the sacrament of Communion and in fact, discourages laity involvement in the service of Divine Liturgy.

===Hinduism===
In [[Hinduism]], menstruating women are traditionally considered ritually impure and given rules to follow. During menstruation, women are not allowed to “enter the kitchen and temples", wear flowers, have sex, touch other males or females.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Menstruation, Religion and Society|last = Bhartiya|first = Aru|date = November 2013|journal = International Journal of Social Science and Humanity|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women themselves are seen as impure and polluted, and are often isolated as untouchables, unable to return to their family, for the length of their period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Restriction and Renewal, Pollution and Power, Constraint and Community: The Paradoxes of Religious Women's Experiences of Menstruation|last = Dunnavant|first = Nicki|date = 2012|journal = Sex Roles|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the Kerala High Court restricted entry of women above the age of 10 and below the age of 50 from [[Sabarimala]] Shrine as they were of the menstruating age. On 28th September  2018, the Supreme Court of India lifted the ban on the entry of women. It said that discrimination against women on any grounds, even religious, is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sabarimala-temple-entry-live-updates/article25066336.ece|title=Supreme Court upholds the right of women of all ages to worship at Sabarimala {{!}} Live updates|last=Desk|first=The Hindu Net|date=2018-09-28|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/keralas-sabarimala-temple-must-allow-women-of-all-ages-says-supreme-court-ending-restriction-1923556|title=Women Of All Ages Can Enter Sabarimala Temple, Says Top Court, Ending Ban|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shaktism====
[[Image:Kamakhya aiya.jpg|thumb|[[Kamakhya]] [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja festival]]]]
In [[Shaktism]] the Earth's [[menstruation]] is celebrated during the [[Ambubachi Mela]], an annual fertility festival held in June, in [[Assam]], India. During Ambubachi, the annual menstruation course of the goddess [[Kamakhya]] is worshipped in the [[Kamakhya Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.durga-puja.org/kamakhya-temple.html|title=Kamakhya Temple|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple stays closed for three days and then reopens to receive pilgrims and worshippers. It is one of the most important pilgrimage sites in the world, attracting millions of visitors each year, particularly for Ambubachi Mela which draws upwards of 100,000 pilgrims per day during the 4-day festival.&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boloji.com/wfs/wfs082.htm|title=Celebrating The Divine Female Principle|last=Chawla|first=Janet|date=16 September 2002|publisher=Boloji.com|accessdate=24 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131031243/http://boloji.com/wfs/wfs082.htm|archive-date=31 January 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{See also|Islamic hygienical jurisprudence}}
During menstrual periods, women are excused from performing prayers. They should not fast and left over fasts of [[Ramadan]] are to be completed during other days. During menses pilgrimages are allowed; however, circumambulation of the [[Kaaba]] is prohibited and is to be performed during other times. Respect for women on their period is valued. They are advised to not enter the praying place of mosque without any important purpose, but are encouraged to be present at muslims gatherings and festivals ([[Muslim holidays|Eid]]s). After the period, a bath ([[Ghusl]]), which is also required of both partners after sex, is also required before prayer  may continue.
{{quote|And they ask you about menstruation; Say It is harm, so keep away from women during menstruation; And do not approach them until they become pure And when they have purified themselves, then come to them from where Allah has ordained for you; Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves. Your women are your tilth, so come to your tilth as you wish and put forth for yourselves; And fear Allah and know that you will meet Him; And give good tidings to the believers. (Al-Quran 2:222-223)}}

The traditional Islamic interpretation of the [[Qur'an]] forbids intercourse, but not physical intimacy, during a woman's menstrual period.&lt;ref name="Koran2.222"&gt;{{Citation|title=Koran|chapter=2.222|chapterurl=http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/ot2www-koran?specfile=/lv2/english/relig/koran/www/koran.o2w&amp;act=surround&amp;offset=54748&amp;tag=Koran.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Qur'an]] explicitly prohibits a menstruating woman from sexual intercourse. If a man is engaged in sexual intercourse with his wife and discovers that her period has started, he must immediately withdraw.

Scholars argue that menstruating women are in a state in which they are unable to maintain [[wudhu]], and are therefore prohibited from touching the Arabic version of the Qur'an. Similarly, other biological and involuntary functions such as vomiting, bleeding, sexual intercourse, and going to the bathroom invalidate one's wudhu. On authority of [[Urwah]]{{disambiguation needed|date=June 2018}}:&lt;ref name="ahadith"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ahadith.co.uk/chapter.php?cid=28|title=Sahih Bukhari, Chapter: 6, Menstrual Periods|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text="A person asked me, 'Can a woman in menses serve me? And can a [[Junub]] woman come close to me?' I replied, 'All this is easy for me. All of them can serve me, and there is no harm for any other person to do the same. 'Aisha told me that she used to comb the hair of Allah's Apostle while she was in her menses, and he was in [[Itikaf]] (in the mosque). He would bring his head near her in her room and she would comb his hair, while she used to be in her menses.'"}}

Menstruating women are also prohibited from engaging in [[tawaf]] during [[Hajj]]. When A'isha wept to  Muhammad when she was not able to perform tawaf on her menses, Muhammad responded, "This is a thing which [[Allah]] has ordained for the daughters of [[Adam]]. So do what all the pilgrims do with the exception of the Tawaf (Circumambulation) round the [[Ka'ba]]." &lt;ref name="ahadith"/&gt;

===Judaism===
{{Main|Niddah}}
In [[Judaism]], a woman during [[menstruation]] is called "[[niddah]]" and may be banned from certain actions. For example, the Jewish [[Torah]] prohibits sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman.&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 15:19-30, 18:19, 20:18&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual exclusion of "niddah" applies to a woman while menstruating and for about a week thereafter, until she immerses herself in a [[mikvah]] (ritual bath) which is basically intended only for married women. During this time, a married couple must avoid sexual intercourse and physical intimacy. Orthodox Judaism forbids women and men from even touching or passing things to each other during this period. While Orthodox Jews follow this exclusion, many Jews in other branches of the religion do not.

In the Torah ([[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 15:19-30), a menstruating female is considered ritually unclean - "anyone who touches her will be unclean until evening" ([[New International Version]]). Touching a menstruating female, touching an object she had sat on or lain on, or having intercourse with her also makes a person ritually unclean. The extent to which these rules are observed in modern Judaism varies depending on the degree of conservatism/orthodoxy.

=== Others ===

==== Bahá'í Faith ====
[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], in the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'' abolished all forms of ritual impurity of people and things and stressed the importance of cleanliness and spiritual purity. Menstruating women are encouraged to pray and are not required to fast; they have the (voluntary) alternative of reciting a verse instead.&lt;ref name="smith-purtity"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2000|title=purity|encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location=Oxford|last=Smith|first=Peter|pages=281–282|isbn=978-1-85168-184-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jainism ====
Woman's menstrual blood is considered to be impure in several important [[Jainism|Jain]] texts. The bleeding that occurs in menstruation is thought to kill micro-organisms in the body, making the female body less non-violent than the male body—although that idea does not have any scientific support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/beliefs/women.shtml "Jainism - beliefs"], BBC.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt; Jainism does not permit women to cook or attend temples while menstruating.

==== Shinto ====
In Japan, the religion of [[Shinto]] did and still does play a part in their society. The [[Kami]], the spirits they worshiped, would not grant wishes if you had traces of blood, dirt, or death on you. While menstruation is not entirely blood, the ancient Japanese did not know that. As a result, women who were menstruating were not allowed to visit any of the Kami shrines for the duration of their menstrual period. Even today, women are not allowed to enter Shinto shrines and temples during menstruation, and in some instances, women are completely banned from climbing the tops of sacred mountains due to their 'impurity'. Furthermore, the tradition is kept somewhat alive in the belief that the shedding of the endometrial lining is a kind of death. It is theorized that the Kami are the reason Japan is kept so clean and, in many houses, minimalistic.

====Sikhism ====
In [[Sikhism]], woman is given equal status to man and is regarded as pure as man is. The [[Sikh gurus]] teach that one cannot be pure by washing his body but purity of mind is the real pureness. They are not called pure, who sit down after merely washing their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Only they are pure, O Nanak, within whose minds the Lord abides. ||2|| (Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, Ang 472)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Nānak]], the founder of Sikhism, condemned the practice of treating women as impure while menstruating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhartiya|first=Aru|date=2013|title=Menstruation, Religion and Society|url=http://www.ijssh.org/index.php?m=content&amp;c=index&amp;a=show&amp;catid=43&amp;id=595|journal=International Journal of Social Science and Humanity|pages=523–527|doi=10.7763/ijssh.2013.v3.296|issn=2010-3646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sikhism, the menstrual cycle is not considered a pollutant. Certainly, it can have a physical and physiological effect on the woman. Nonetheless, this is not considered a hindrance to her wanting to pray or accomplish her religious duties fully. The Guru makes it very clear that the menstrual cycle is a God-given process. The blood of a woman is required for the creation of any human being.&lt;ref&gt;"By coming together of mother and father are we created, By union of the mother's blood and the father's semen is the body made. To the Lord is the creature devoted, when hanging head downwards in the womb; He whom he contemplates, for him provides." (Guru Granth Sahib Ji, p.1013).&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement of the mother's blood is fundamental for life. Thus, the menstrual cycle is certainly an essential and God-given biological process. In other faiths blood is considered a pollutant. However, the Guru rejects such ideas. Those who are impure from within are the truly impure ones.&lt;ref&gt;"Should cloth be reckoned impure if blood-stained, How may minds of such be deemed pure, who suck the blood of mankind? Says Nanak: With a pure heart and tongue God's Name you utter: All else is worldly show, and false deeds." (Guru Granth Sahib Ji, pg. 140).&lt;/ref&gt;

Meditating on God's name is of importance in Sikhism. Whether your clothes are blood stained or not (including clothes stained from menstrual blood) is not of spiritual importance. Thus, there are no restrictions placed on a woman during her menstruation. She is free to visit a [[gurdwara]], take part in prayers and do [[selfless service|Seva]]. In ''The Feminine Principle'' in the Sikh vision of the transcendent, Nikky Guninder Kaur-Singh writes:

: 'The denigration of the female body "expressed in many cultural and religious taboos surrounding menstruation and child-Birth" is absent in the Sikh worldview. ... Guru Nanak openly chides those who attribute pollution to women because of menstruation'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchsikhism.com/islam4.html "Islam 4"], SearchSikhism.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaur-Singh, Nikky-Guninder (1993). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=w0Eff2FtiAoC The Feminine Principle in the Sikh Vision of the Transcendent]''. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0521432871}}. pp. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guru [[Nānak]], the founder of [[Sikhism]], condemned the practice of treating women as impure while menstruating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Singh|first=Kanwarjit|title=Political Philosophy of the Sikh Gurus|year=1989|chapter=Chapter V - Human Rights|chapterurl=http://allaboutsikhs.com/books/kjs/06.htm|publisher=Atlantic|accessdate=12 June 2006}} {{dead link|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sikhism, the menstrual cycle is not considered a pollutant.

== By region ==

===Africa===
Across the continent of Africa, a wide variety of menstruation-related customs have been recorded.
====Zambia====
A cloth torn from the traditional wrap (chitenge) is worn, part tied around the waist and part looped under the crutch, to catch menstrual fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lahme|first=Anne Mutunda|last2=Stern|first2=Ruth|last3=Cooper|first3=Diane|date=2018-03-01|title=Factors impacting on menstrual hygiene and their implications for health promotion|journal=Global Health Promotion|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=54–62|doi=10.1177/1757975916648301|pmid=27380769|issn=1757-9759|hdl=10566/3604}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Menarche]] (the first menstrual cycle at puberty) is traditionally treated as a sign that the girl is probably ready for sex and marriage, as well as for adult duties in the household. [[Rite of passage|Initiation rites]] on menarche include instruction on sex and marital relations as well as on menstrual management. This is conducted by older women. It is taboo to talk about menstruation with men, or to learn from one's own mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.projectluangwa.org/healthandmenstruation|title=Health and Menstruation|website=Project Luangwa|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
===South Asia===
In some portions of South Asia, there is a menstrual taboo, with it frequently being considered impure. Restrictions on movement, behaviour and eating are frequently placed.&lt;ref name="jptimesonethird" /&gt; More than one-third of girls across South Asia do not go to school during menstruation.&lt;ref name="jptimesonethird"&gt;{{Cite news| title = A Third of Girls in South Asia Miss School During Periods: Report| work = [[The Japan Times]]| date =22 May 2018| url = https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/05/22/asia-pacific/social-issues-asia-pacific/third-girls-south-asia-miss-school-periods-report/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of that is due to lack of safe and comfortable toilets at school (lack of [[WASH#Schools|water, sanitation and hygiene in schools]] in developing countries).
==== Laos ====
A small study in a rural area in Laos (Savannakhet) found that menstruation is considered taboo and shameful.&lt;ref name="ChinLaos"&gt;Chin, L. (2014).

==== India ====
Hindus in India tend to view menstruation, especially first menstruation or [[menarche]], as a positive aspect of a girl's life. In South India, girls who experience their menstrual period for the first time are given presents and celebrations to mark the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://living.oneindia.in/expressions/celebrate-womanhood.html|title=Celebrate Womanhood|author=Supriya, Sharon|date=23 November 2007|publisher=OneIndia|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027080002/http://living.oneindia.in/expressions/celebrate-womanhood.html|archivedate=27 October 2007|deadurl=yes|accessdate=28 December 2007|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many traditional Hindu homes in India, girls and women face restrictive taboos relative to menstruation, such as being denied entry to the temple and the kitchen.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arumugam|first=Balaji|last2=Nagalingam|first2=Saranya|last3=Varman|first3=Priyadharshini Mahendra|last4=Ravi|first4=Preethi|last5=Ganesan|first5=Roshni|date=2014|title=Menstrual Hygiene Practices: Is it Practically Impractical?|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=99519198&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=International Journal of Medicine and Public Health|volume=4|issue=4|pages=472–476|doi=10.4103/2230-8598.144120|pmid=|access-date=29 June 2015|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas around the [[Jhabua district|Jhabua]] district, the belief is that "menstruation is a disease and not a normal biological process", and therefore women who are menstruating are not allowed to sleep on beds, enter kitchens, touch male members of their family or eat spicy foods.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=2W61522743831&amp;site=ehost-live|title=The Periodic Misogyny of Tribal Madhya Pradesh|last=Tomar|first=Shruti|date=31 May 2015|work=Hindustan Times|access-date=29 June 2015|via=Newspaper Source}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 study conducted in [[India]], the researchers found that as many as 42% of women who participated in the study did not know about sanitary pads or from where in their anatomy menstruation originated. "Most of them were scared or worried on first menstruation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Indonesia====
In [[Bali]], a woman is not allowed to enter the kitchen to perform her usual duties, nor is she allowed to have sex with her husband while menstruating. She is to sleep apart from the family and has to keep her clothes that she wears while menstruating away from any clothes that she could wear to the temple. One of the most important regulations is that a woman is not allowed to attend temple while menstruating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedersen|first1=L|year=2002|title=Ambiguous Bleeding: Purity And Sacrifice In Bali|url=|journal=Ethnology|volume=41|issue=4|pages=303–15|doi=10.2307/4153010|jstor=4153010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sumba]], women keep their cycles secret, which makes men see them as deceitful. Women from Sumba believe that because of their secrecy, they will always have control of the men. "Men will never know how much we really can do to control these things. We have all kinds of secrets, and they should always believe that we can control even more than we really can".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoskins|first1=J|year=2002|title=The Menstrual Hut And The Witch's Lair In Two Eastern Indonesian Societies|url=|journal=Ethnology|volume=41|issue=4|pages=317–33|doi=10.2307/4153011|jstor=4153011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are supposed to avoid intercourse while menstruating. It is believed that sexually transmitted diseases are the results of women deceiving men and having intercourse while they are menstruating. Gonorrhea translates as "disease you get from women" in Sumba; it has become a social problem. When a man would get this disease, the only way they believed he could rid himself of painful sores was to pass it to a woman. The reasoning was that a woman's body can absorb infection and purge it during a cycle.

==== Nepal ====
{{Main|Chhaupadi}}
Hindus in Nepal traditionally keep women isolated during menstruation, when women who are menstruating are not allowed in the household for a period of 3 nights. This practise was banned by the Nepalese Supreme Court in 2005 but still continues.&lt;ref&gt;Sushil Sharma, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4250506.stm "Women hail menstruation ruling"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831235652/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4250506.stm |date=31 August 2010 }}, ''BBC News'', 15 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chhaupadi]] is a social tradition associated with a menstrual taboo in the western part of Nepal. The tradition prohibits Hindu women and girls from participating in normal family activities while menstruating, as they are considered "impure". In some parts of western Nepal, the custom of ''[[chhaupadi]]'' requires menstruating girls and women to sleep in a hut called ''Chhau Goth'' some distance from the family home

==== Sri Lanka ====
Two-thirds of girls in [[Sri Lanka]] were unaware of menstruation before reaching [[puberty]].&lt;ref name="jptimesonethird" /&gt;

The [[Yurok]] in North America practiced menstrual seclusion. Yurok women used a small hut near the main house.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber, A. L. 1925. ''Handbook of the Indians of California''. Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin No. 78. Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted in 1981 showed that a substantial majority of U.S. adults and adolescents believed that it is socially unacceptable to discuss menstruation, especially in mixed company. Many believed that it is unacceptable to discuss menstruation even within the family.&lt;ref&gt;Research &amp; Forecasts, Inc. (1981). "The Tampax Report: Summary of Survey Results on a Study of Attitudes towards Menstruation".

Menstruation education is frequently taught in combination with sex education in the US, although one study suggests that girls would prefer their mothers to be the primary source of information about menstruation and puberty.&lt;ref name="Sooki"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sooki|first=Zahra|last2=Shariati|first2=Mohammad|last3=Chaman|first3=Reza|last4=Khosravi|first4=Ahmad|last5=Effatpanah|first5=Mohammad|last6=Keramat|first6=Afsaneh|date=2016-02-20|title=The Role of Mother in Informing Girls About Puberty: A Meta-Analysis Study|journal=Nursing and Midwifery Studies|volume=5|issue=1|pages=e30360|doi=10.17795/nmsjournal30360|issn=2322-1488|pmc=4915208|pmid=27331056}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Nigerian study showed the following breakdown in menstruation education: “parents of 56%, friends of 53%, books of 46%, teachers of 44%, internet of 45%, and health centers of 54” held the most influence in terms of menstruation education.&lt;ref name="Sooki"/&gt; Information about menstruation is often shared among friends and peers, which may promote a more positive outlook on puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hatami|first=Mahnaz|last2=Kazemi|first2=Ashraf|last3=Mehrabi|first3=Tayebeh|date=2015-12-30|title=Effect of peer education in school on sexual health knowledge and attitude in girl adolescents|journal=Journal of Education and Health Promotion|volume=4|pages=78|doi=10.4103/2277-9531.171791|issn=2277-9531|pmc=4944604|pmid=27462620|doi-broken-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of menstrual education in a society determines the accuracy of people's understanding of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen et al.|first=Katherine|title=More Than Just a Punctuation Mark: How Boys and Young Men Learn About Menstruation|journal=Journal of Family Issues|volume=32|issue=2|pages=129–156|doi=10.1177/0192513X10371609|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in part due to the segregation of male and female peers during educational sessions. Failure to teach an accurate understanding of menstruation to students of all genders has social implications for gendered relationships and the objectification of women’s bodies. Discomfort arises when students do not have access to the same information, reinforcing the belief “that menstruation is gross and should be kept hidden”.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Katherine R.|last2=Kaestle|first2=Christine E.|last3=Goldberg|first3=Abbie E.|title=More Than Just a Punctuation Mark: How Boys and Young Men Learn About Menstruation|journal=Journal of Family Issues|volume=32|issue=2|pages=129–156|doi=10.1177/0192513x10371609|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls are encouraged to conceal the fact that they may be menstruating in order to be considered desirable. Sexual harassment and teasing about menstruation cause girls anxiety as they must struggle to ensure that they give no sign of menstruation.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Effective educational programs are essential to providing children and adolescents with clear and accurate information about menstruation. Several education and sexual health experts have studied the key features necessary for such programs. Some experts maintain that schools are an appropriate place for menstrual education to take place because they are an institution that young people attend consistently. Schools are intended to expand students’ knowledge and thus serve as an appropriate site for conveying menstrual education.&lt;ref name="Kirby 27–33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirby|first=Douglas|date=February 2002|title=The impact of schools and school programs upon adolescent sexual behavior|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=39|issue=1|pages=27–33|doi=10.1080/00224490209552116|issn=0022-4499|pmid=12476253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other experts argue that programs led by peers or third-party agencies are more effective than those taught in the school classroom. This may be due to the use of small group interactions, the ability of these programs to target specific populations, or the possibility that many teenagers choose to participate voluntarily in these programs, rather than being mandated to attend school programs.&lt;ref name="Kirby 27–33"/&gt;

===Advertising===
One common way that sanitary-product advertising avoids depicting menstruation is by pouring a blue, rather than red, liquid on the sanitary product to demonstrate its absorptivity. Further evidence of the taboo is the creation of a variety of euphemisms for menstruation, including "Aunt Flo", "on the rag", "my friend", or even "the curse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlineslangdictionary.com/thesaurus/words%20meaning%20menstruation%20(related%20to).html|title=Slang words for menstruation, menstrual period (related to) - Urban Thesaurus - The Online Slang Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the "Always" [[tampon]] brand created the first feminine hygiene ad to ever feature a tiny red spot, representing blood. The ad was created by an intern who was working at Always' advertising agency, [[Leo Burnett]]. Originally the ad was created for the intern's personal portfolio, but then it caught the attention of the chief creative officer at Leo Burnett, and was subsequently published as an actual ad. There was some controversy when the ad was first released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/06/always-runs-first-feminin_n_891546.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Laura | last=Stampler | title=Bye, Bye Blue Liquid: Always Runs First Feminine Hygiene Ad To Show Blood | date=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://jezebel.com/5856336/how-i-made-the-first-feminine-hygiene-ad-to-show-blood | work=Jezebel | first=Willy | last=Chyr | title=How I Made The First Feminine Hygiene Ad To Ever Feature Blood}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016 the presence of red blood in a UK [[Bodyform]] commercial was greeted with approval in social media for its attempt to challenge the stereotypical menstruation ad, by showing women who struggle despite bleeding from cuts, blows and bruises they receive while playing various sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-06/no-blood-should-hold-us-back-ad/7480408|title='No blood should hold us back': New ad aims to power past period stigma|date=2016-06-06|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/period-menstruation-advertisement-blood-fitness-lifest/1/686016.html|title=FINALLY, a period-related advertisement that features blood|website=indiatoday.intoday.in|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
Movies and television also reflect the taboo nature of menstruation. Typically menstruation as a topic is avoided, except for scenes involving [[menarche]] or the first period.  For example, as Elizabeth Arveda Kissling explains in her article, "On the Rag on Screen: Menarche in Film and  Television", the early 1991 movie ''[[My Girl (film)|My Girl]]'' contains a scene where the main character, Vada, experiences her first period.  The explanation given to her by a female role model of what is happening to her is done off-camera and the subject is never mentioned again, save when Vada pushes Thomas across the porch telling him, "Don't come back for five to seven days."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In the movie ''[[Carrie (1976 film)#Plot|Carrie]]'', the title character has her first period in the school gym shower, and the other girls tease her by throwing [[tampon]]s and [[Sanitary napkin|sanitary pads]] at her. The gym teacher tries to calm Carrie down, and eventually must explain the concept of menstruation to Carrie (because Carrie's mother had never done so). When Carrie returns home, her fanatically religious mother yells at her and throws her into a closet because menstruation is apparently a sign of sin. Later in the movie, her classmates mock her menarche again by pouring pig's blood on her at the prom.

In ''[[Only Yesterday (1991 film)|Only Yesterday]]'', one of the girls is found to be going through menstruation and is later teased about it, especially when a group of boys tell the others not to touch a ball she had touched by saying, "You'll catch her period".

In the 2007 movie ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', Seth discovers menstrual blood on his jeans after dancing with a woman. He reacts with disgust, as do other men in the scene.

===Menstrual suppression===
{{Main|Menstrual suppression}}
With the recent FDA approval of menstrual suppression medications, researchers have begun to shift their focus to the attitudes of American women toward their periods. One study in particular found that 59% of the women they surveyed reported an interest in not menstruating every month.  Of these, 1/3 said they were interested in not menstruating at all anymore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = L.C. Andrist et al. | title = Women's and providers' attitudes toward menstrual suppression with extended use of oral contraceptives | journal = Contraception | volume = 70 | pages = 359–363 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1016/j.contraception.2004.06.008 | pmid = 15504373 | first1 = LC | last2 = Arias | first2 = RD | last3 = Nucatola | first3 = D | last4 = Kaunitz | first4 = AM | last5 = Musselman | first5 = BL | last6 = Reiter | first6 = S | last7 = Boulanger | first7 = J | last8 = Dominguez | first8 = L | last9 = Emmert | first9 = S | displayauthors = 8| issue = 5 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthropologist]]s, Lock and Nguyen (2010), have noted that the heavy medicalization of the reproductive life-stages of women in the West, mimic power structures that are deemed, in other cultural practices, to function as a form of "[[social control]]".&lt;ref name="Lock"&gt;Lock, M. &amp; Nguyen, V.-K., 2010. ''An Anthropology of Biomedicine''. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Medicalization of the stages of women's lives, such as birth and menstruation, has enlivened a feminist perspective that investigates the social implications of [[biomedicine]]’s practice. "[C]ultural analysis of reproduction…attempts to show how women…exhibit resistance and create dominant alternative meanings about the body and reproduction to those dominant among the medical profession."&lt;ref name="Lock" /&gt;

===Activism===
Menstrual activism (otherwise known as radical menstruation, menstrual anarchy, or menarchy) is a movement that addresses menstrual taboos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/oct/02/menstruation-feminist-activists | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Kira | last=Cochrane | title=Women and women's interests, Health and wellbeing (Life and style), Life and style, Feminism (World news), World news | date=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overcoming this taboo is a point of contention amongst [[feminism|feminists]]. The primary argument behind this movement is that if menstruation is normal, there is no reason why the topic should be avoided: "After a while it becomes psychologically disorienting for women to look out at a world where their reality doesn't exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Houppert | first = Karen | title = The Curse: Confronting the Last Unmentionable Taboo: Menstruation | year = 1999 | publisher = Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-374-27366-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Menstruation can be conceptualized as a stigmatized condition that both reflects and reinforces women’s perceived lower status in relation to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnston-Robledo|first1=I.|last2=Chrisler|first2=J. C.|title=The menstrual mark: Menstruation as social stigma|journal=Sex Roles|volume=68|date=2011|issue=Sex Roles|pages=9–18|doi=10.1007/s11199-011-0052-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholars extend this theory to explain negative attitudes towards women's bodily functions.&lt;ref name="Johnston-Robledo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnston-Robledo|first1=Ingrid|last2=Stubbs|first2=Margaret L.|title=Positioning Periods: Menstruation in Social Context: An Introduction to a Special Issue|journal=Sex Roles|date=3 September 2012|volume=68|issue=1–2|pages=1–8|doi=10.1007/s11199-012-0206-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such stigmatization occurs when menstrual blood is viewed as one of the "abominations" of the body and reflects a gendered identity among women, which leads to consequences for women's psychological and sexual
well-being.&lt;ref name="Johnston-Robledo" /&gt;

Feminists such as Chella Quint have spoken against the use of shaming in advertising for feminine hygiene products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quint|first1=Chella|title=Adventures in Menstruating: Don't Use Shame to Sell|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxSheffield-2012-Chella-Quint;search%3AChella%20Quint%20|website=TEDxTalks}}&lt;/ref&gt; She created a zine, Adventures in Menstruating, to "help alter the visibility of menstruation, so that it's at least normal to talk about it. Because, right now, it's not".&lt;ref name="It's in the blood"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cochrane|first1=Kira|title=It's in the blood|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/oct/02/menstruation-feminist-activists|accessdate=11 March 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other menstrual activists include Rachel Kauder Nalebuff, who published ''My Little Red Book''; filmmaker and academic Giovanna Chesler, who created the documentary ''Period: The End of Menstruation''; and artist Ingrid Berthon-Moine, who exhibited a video and series of photographs at the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref name="It's in the blood" /&gt;

=== Medicine ===
Blood from female [[menstruation]] has been used in [[medicines]]. In Chinese [[Daoism|Daoist]] alchemy, menstrual blood from females who had not had sexual intercourse was used to make a substance to prolongue an individual's life, called red lead ({{zh|c=红铅|p=hóng qiān}}).&lt;ref name="zhang"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2007|title=壬寅宫变 宫女献身|trans-title=The ''renyin'' palace rebellion: palace women sacrifice themselves|journal=Quanzhou Wenxue|language=Chinese|issue=1|author-last=Zhang 张|author-first=Yongchang 永昌}}&lt;/ref&gt; The substance was taken by the [[Ming dynasty]] [[Jiajing Emperor]] and the abuses inflicted on the palace women to ensure the blood's purity led to the [[Renyin palace rebellion]].&lt;ref name="huang"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2011|title=壬寅宫变与嘉靖皇帝之崇奉方术|trans-title=The palace rebellion of ''renyin'' and the Jiajing Emperor's belief in alchemy|journal=Xiang Chao|language=Chinese|issue=10|author-last=Huang 黄|author-first=Weibo 伟波}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Menstrual synchrony===
{{Main|Menstrual synchrony}}

[[Menstrual synchrony]] is an alleged process whereby women who begin living together in close proximity experience their [[menstrual cycle]] onsets (the onset of [[menstruation]] or menses) becoming more synchronized together in time than when previously living apart.&lt;ref name="Gosline2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=do-women-who-live-together-menstruate-together|title=Do Women Who Live Together Menstruate Together?|last=Gosline|first=Anna|date=December 7, 2007|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 review concluded that menstrual synchrony likely does not exist.&lt;ref name="Harris2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=Amy L.|last2=Vitzthum|first2=Virginia J.|year=2013|title=Darwin's Legacy: An Evolutionary View of Women's Reproductive and Sexual Functioning|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=50|issue=3–4|pages=207–46|doi=10.1080/00224499.2012.763085|pmid=23480070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5372">The '''cyclic alternating pattern''' (abbreviated '''CAP''') is a pattern of two, long-lasting alternate [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG) patterns that occur in [[sleep]], as described by Terzano, et al, in 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Terzano|first=M.

It is a pattern of spontaneous cortical activity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles and Practice of Sleep Medicine|last=Kryger|first=|publisher=Elsevier|year=2017|isbn=9780323242882|location=|pages=1576}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is ongoing and in the absence of sensory stimulation. It is the reorganization of the sleeping brain challenged by the modification of environmental conditions and it is characterized by periodic abnormal electrocortical activity that recurs with a frequency of up to one minute&lt;ref name="copm"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parrino|first=Liborio|last2=Grassi|first2=Andrea|last3=Milioli|first3=Giulia|date=November 2014|title=Cyclic alternating pattern in polysomnography: what is it and what does it mean?|journal=Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine|volume=20|issue=6|pages=533–541|doi=10.1097/MCP.0000000000000100|issn=1531-6971|pmid=25188718}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[Lennox–Gastaut syndrome|Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]], CAP modulates the occurrence of clinical seizures and generalized epileptic discharges by means of a gate-control mechanism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2001-09-01|title=Sleep in Lennox–Gastaut syndrome: the role oft the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) in the gate control of clinical seizures and generalized polyspikes|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920121101002807|journal=Epilepsy Research|language=en|volume=46|issue=3|pages=241–250|doi=10.1016/S0920-1211(01)00280-7|issn=0920-1211}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

As noted at MedLink.com, CAP is a marker of sleep instability and it is found during non-rapid eye movement sleep. CAP is organized into sequences of successive cycles composed of two phases, A and B. Phase A involves phasic events, in other words, not continuous. Phase A subtypes of CAP allow adaptive adjustments of ongoing states to internal and external inputs&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles and Practice of Sleep Medicine|last=Kryger|first=|publisher=Elsevier|year=2017|isbn=9780323242882|location=|pages=1586-1587}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Phase B refers to background rhythm during CAP. Furthermore, CAP involves cerebral activities and is influenced by autonomic and motor functions. Interaction between CAP and neurovegetative fluctuations and motor events determine the pathophysiology of several sleep disorders and the effect of medication on [[continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP) treatment (CPAP is used to treat [[obstructive sleep apnea]] or OSA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medlink.com/article/cyclic_alternating_pattern|title=Cyclic alternating pattern|website=www.medlink.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

CAP is a marker of NREM instability and is also the "master clock" that accompanies the stage transitions maintained in sleep phases, noted in both the EEG and by autonomic functions through regular fluctuations. CAP is decreased in narcolepsy, multiple system atrophy, in certain cases of drug administration, with CPAP treatment for OSA, and during night-time recovery sleep after prolonged sleep deprivation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. There is a relationship present between CAP and arousals that allows for adjustements of vigilance during sleep. If there is a failure in this relationship during sleep, sleep disorders may develop.

Rechtschaffen and Kales have developed the standard criteria for sleep staging in 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=Rechtschaffen%20A,%20Kales%20A%20(1968)|title=A manual of standardized terminology, techniques and scoring system for sleep stages of human subjects. Allan Rechtschaffen and Anthony Kales, editors. - NLM Catalog - NCBI|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1992, the AASM defined arousals as markers of sleep disruption, which is harmful for sleep. According to Boselli, et al, in 1998 it was noted that spontaneous arousals are natural in sleep and increase over life&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boselli|first=M.|last2=Parrino|first2=L.|last3=Smerieri|first3=A.|last4=Terzano|first4=M.

On 8 January 2017, [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]], the fourth [[President of Iran]] and the country's Chairman of [[Expediency Discernment Council]], died at the age of 82 after suffering a [[heart attack]]. He was transferred to a hospital in [[Tajrish]], north [[Tehran]] without consciousness. Attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation for more than an hour trying to revive him were unsuccessful and he died at 19:30 [[Iran Standard Time|local time]] (UTC+3:30).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38548591 |title=Iran's ex-President Rafsanjani dies at 82|date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/08/former-iranian-president-akbar-hashemi-rafsanjani-dead.html|title=Former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani dead|date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/iran-president-hashemi-rafsanjani-dies-82-170108163407762.html|title=Iran's ex-president Hashemi Rafsanjani dies at 82|date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Government of Iran|Iranian government]] observed a [[national mourning]] period of 3 days.

The '''Drainage Services Department''' (DSD) is a department of the [[Hong Kong Government]] responsible for drainage and sewerage. Since 2007 it has been subordinate to the [[Development Bureau]].

==Responsibilities==
The department is responsible for [[stormwater]] drainage, [[Sewerage|sewage collection]] and [[Sewage treatment|treatment]], and [[Flood control|flood prevention]].

==History==
Environmental protection was one of the main concerns of former governor [[David Wilson, Baron Wilson of Tillyorn|David Wilson]].&lt;ref name=scmp1988&gt;{{cite news|title=Ambitious $10 billion sewage plan|work=South China Morning Post|date=13 October 1988|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson stressed the importance of better planning, increased control of pollution discharges, and large-scale investment in improved sewage disposal infrastructure. He stated that Hong Kong needed more treatment facilities and new outfalls constructed sufficiently far out to sea, and promoted a new department to help achieve this.&lt;ref name=scmp1988/&gt; The Drainage Services Department was established in 1989.

==Major infrastructure works==
===Harbour Area Treatment Scheme===
The Harbour Area Treatment Scheme (HATS) is a major sewage treatment infrastructure improvement scheme designed to improve the water quality of [[Victoria Harbour]]. Originally called the Strategic Sewage Disposal Scheme, the plan was drawn up in 1989 and construction of HATS Stage 1 commenced in 1994. It comprises a system of deep tunnels to convey sewage from eight Preliminary Treatment Works to the Stonecutters Island Sewage Treatment Works, which opened in 1997. The full Stage I system, which treats 75% of the sewage generated by the urban areas around the harbour, came online in December 2001. Construction of HATS Stage 2 commenced in 2008, and stage 2A was commissioned in 2015. HATS Stage 2B, comprising an underground biological treatment facility at Stonecutters Island, has been shelved as it is felt that the existing facility is sufficient at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harbour Area Treatment Scheme|url=http://www.gov.hk/en/residents/environment/water/harbourarea.htm|publisher=Hong Kong Government|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drainage tunnels===
The department has built several significant bored tunnels designed to intercept water running down mountain slopes and divert it from urban areas in order to prevent flooding.

The largest of these is the Hong Kong West Drainage Tunnel, comprising an 11-kilometre long main tunnel and 8 km of adits. It stretches from [[Tai Hang]] in the east to an outfall just north of [[Cyberport]]. It was built at a cost of HK$3.4 billion. Construction commenced in November 2007 and the tunnel was commissioned on 22 August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hong Kong West Drainage Tunnel commissioned|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201208/22/P201208210597.htm|publisher=Hong Kong Government|date=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lai Chi Kok Drainage Tunnel encircles [[Sham Shui Po]] and [[Lai Chi Kok]]. It is a 3.7-kilometre tunnel, stretching from Shek Kip Mei to an outfall near [[Stonecutters Island]], built at a cost of $1.7 billion. Construction commenced in November 2008 and the tunnel was commissioned on 18 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lai Chi Kok Drainage Tunnel commissioned|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201210/18/P201210180317.htm|publisher=Hong Kong Government|date=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tsuen Wan Drainage Tunnel protects the [[Tsuen Wan New Town]] and [[Kwai Chung]] areas. The 5.1-kilometre tunnel begins at Wo Yi Hop, north of Kwai Chung, and curves around the north of Tsuen Wan proper. Past [[Chai Wan Kok]], it parallels the Tuen Mun Highway a short distance and then empties into the Rambler Channel. Construction of the $1.5 billion tunnel commenced in 2007. It was commissioned on 28 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tsuen Wan Drainage Tunnel commissioned|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201303/28/P201303270459.htm|publisher=Hong Kong Government|date=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vessels==
[[File:Clean Harbour 2.jpg|thumbnail|Clean Harbour 2]]
The department operates two sludge transport vessels, called Clean Harbour 1 and Clean Harbour 2. These ships transport sludge from the Stonecutters Island Sewage Treatment Works to the sludge treatment facility in Tuen Mun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maiden voyage of DSD's sludge vessel Clean Harbour 1|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201503/05/P201503050503.htm|publisher=Hong Kong Government|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships are equipped with gantry cranes capable of lifting sludge from the lorries directly into containers on board, and can lift 10 containers per hour. Each ship can carry 90 containers of sludge, a total of 1,200 tons of sludge. The vessels were built by Jinhui Shipbuilding of [[Zhongshan]] and commissioned in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=净港1号顺利下水|url=http://www.jinhuishipyard.com/show.php?id=73|publisher=Jin Hui Ship Repair and Building Factory|date=14 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122233736/http://www.jinhuishipyard.com/show.php?id=73|archivedate=22 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act''', ({{USPL|111|31}}, {{USBill|111|H.R.|1256}}) is a [[Law of the United States#Federal law|federal statute]] in the [[United States]] that was signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] on June 22, 2009. The Act gives the [[Food and Drug Administration]] the power to regulate the [[tobacco industry]]. A signature element of the law imposes new warnings and labels on tobacco packaging and their advertisements, with the goal of discouraging minors and young adults from smoking. The Act also bans flavored cigarettes, places limits on the advertising of tobacco products to minors and requires tobacco companies to seek FDA approval for new tobacco products.

==Origins and proposal==
On March 21, 2000, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.]]'', in a 5-4 decision, held that the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], particularly when considering "Congress’ subsequent tobacco-specific legislation," that Congress had not given the FDA the authority to [[Regulation of tobacco by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|regulate tobacco products]] as customarily marketed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/98-1152.ZS.html FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120 (2000)].&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was introduced to respond to the decision, which had held that the Clinton administration's FDA had "overreached" its Congressionally delegated authority, thus giving the FDA the authority the Court determined it had lacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rushing |first1=J.

==Legislative history==
The bill passed the [[United States House of Representatives]] on April 2, 2009, by a vote of 298 to 112.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll187.xml Final Vote Results for Roll Call 187] from house.gov&lt;/ref&gt; The House bill had 178 cosponsors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR01256:@@@P|title=Cosponsors - H.R.1256 - 111th Congress (2009-2010): Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act|first=Waxman,|last=Henry|date=22 June 2009|website=thomas.loc.gov|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the companion legislation in the Senate, {{USBill|111|S|982}} had 57 cosponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN00982:@@@P|title=Cosponsors - S.982 - 111th Congress (2009-2010): Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act|first=Kennedy,|last=Edward|date=20 May 2009|website=thomas.loc.gov|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20, 2009, the Senate [[Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]] ordered the Senate bill to be reported favorably with amendments on a 15-8 vote.&lt;ref name=Rushing&gt;{{cite web

The Capitol Hill newspaper ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' reported on May 25, 2009, that [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid|Reid]] planned to move on the bill during the month of June 2009; however it noted that Senators [[Richard Burr|Burr]] and [[Kay Hagan|Hagan]] of [[North Carolina]] were proposing alternative legislation.&lt;ref name=Rushing/&gt;

On June 2, the Senate voted 84-11 to proceed to consideration of the House bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The "Senate bill requires that cigarette health warning labels be large enough to make up 50 percent of the front and rear panels of the package and that the word “warning” appear in capital letters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=David|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/23509.html|title=Senate vote a sea change for tobacco|work=Politico|date=June 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On June 11, the Senate passed H.R. 1256 by a vote of 79-17, with 3 Senators not voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00207|title=U.S. Senate|website=senate.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passage of the legislation came a week later than was originally scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/35782-1.html|title=Senate Clears Tobacco Regulation Bill|date=11 June 2009|website=Roll Call}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate's version of the bill was approved by the House on June 12, by a bipartisan vote of 307-97.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll335.xml Final Vote Results for Roll Call 335] from house.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

Media accounts noted that the opposition in the Senate was largely from tobacco farming states, particularly Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, with the only Democrat in opposition being [[Kay Hagan]], from North Carolina. Notable exceptions were Virginia Senators [[Jim Webb]] and [[Mark Warner]] who supported the measure, despite the state's connection to the tobacco industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/06/11/senate-passes-bill-increasing-fda-power-to-regulate-tobacco-products/ | work=CNN Political Ticker: Blog Archive | title=Senate passes bill increasing FDA power to regulate tobacco| date=June 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was signed into law on June 22, 2009, by President [[Barack Obama]].

==Provisions==
*Creates the [[Center for Tobacco Products]], a tobacco control center within the FDA and gives the FDA authority to regulate the content, marketing and sale of tobacco products.
*Requires tobacco companies and importers to reveal all product ingredients and seek FDA approval for any new tobacco products (see [[premarket tobacco application]]).
*Allows the FDA to change tobacco product content.
**The ban on flavoring applies to any product meeting the definition of a "cigarette" according to section 3(1) of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. This includes any tobacco that comes rolled in paper or a non-tobacco substance, and added to this definition in the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act is any tobacco with the purpose to be rolled such as rolling tobacco.
*Calls for new rules to prevent sales except through direct, face-to-face exchanges between a retailer and a consumer.
*Limits advertising that could attract young smokers.
*Requires cigarette warning labels to cover 50 percent of the front and rear of each pack, with the word ''warning'' in capital letters.
*Requires FDA approval for the use of expressions such as "light, "mild" or "low" that give the impression that a particular tobacco product poses less of a health risk (see [[modified risk tobacco product]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/71496-fda-tobacco-bill-prevents-ban-forces-them-to-endorse-it|title=FDA Tobacco Bill Prevents Ban, Forces Them to Endorse It|first=Todd|last=Sullivan|date=8 April 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bill makes no provisions that ban the import of the banned items for personal consumption, only for "sale or distribution." (Division A Title II Section 201) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1256&amp;tab=summary|title=Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (2009 - H.R. 1256)|website=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and impact==
Passing of the law was supported by the [[American Cancer Society]], whose CEO noted in a press release that "[t]his bill forces Big Tobacco to disclose the poisons in its products and has the power to finally break the dangerous chain of addiction for generations to come."&lt;ref name=ACS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_House_Votes_to_Grant_FDA_Control_of_Tobacco_Regulation.asp|title=ACS :: House Votes to Grant FDA Control of Tobacco Regulation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ACS press release also noted that the legislation would "require cigarette companies to disclose all ingredients used in cigarettes and to stop using words like 'light' and 'ultra-light' to give the impression that some tobacco products have a lower health risk."  The legislation also garnered support from the [[American Heart Association]], whose CEO noted that the bill "provides a tremendous opportunity to finally hold tobacco companies accountable and restrict efforts to addict more children and adults." &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090611/ap_on_go_co/us_fda_tobacco No smoking: Historic vote could bring new limits - Yahoo!

The law was criticized by some as ineffectual, with [[community health]] sciences professor Michael Siegel stating that it "creates the appearance of regulation without allowing actual regulation." Critics argue that without the authority to eliminate nicotine completely, the reduction of nicotine levels in cigarettes may result in compensation by existing smokers, increasing their cigarette smoke inhalation to consume a level of nicotine which will satisfy their cravings.&lt;ref name="Siegel"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Siegel |title=Tobacco regulations are no regulations at all |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-siegel3-2009jun03,0,1905325.story |archiveurl= |work=Los Angeles Time |date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2009-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tobacco Control Act has been called "the Marlboro Protection Act" because it grandfathered in tobacco products marketed before 2007, while erecting nearly impassable financial and regulatory barriers for the introduction of competing products to the US market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/12/03/house-leaders-rush-to-defend-e-cigarettes-from-possible-fda-bans | title=House Leaders Rush to Defend E-Cigarettes From Possible FDA Bans | publisher=US News | date=3 December 2014 | accessdate=3 December 2014 | author=Nelson, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt; These marketing restrictions enacted by the bill make it more difficult to promote safer smokeless alternatives to cigarettes. The restrictions have been disputed on the grounds of [[free speech]], with some stating that the legislation violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{Cite news|last= |first= |author-link= |publication-date=2009-06-13|year=2009|title =Washington's Marlboro Men|periodical =The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company|pages=A12|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124484664398811283|issn=0099-9660|oclc=4299067|accessdate =2009-06-16|postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill bans flavored cigarettes, including [[Kretek|cloves]], cinnamon, candy, and fruit flavors, with a special exception for [[menthol cigarette]]s. Because [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] is the largest producer of cigarettes in the United States and the bill would have the effect of  eliminating potential competition, the bill has been nicknamed the ''Marlboro Monopoly Act of 2009''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/judgments/2009/06/08/cool-refreshing-legislation-philip-morris?page=full |title=Cool, Refreshing Legislation for Philip Morris: Why it’s politically impossible to ban menthol cigarettes, even if they’re the most addictive |first=Paul |last=Smalera |publisher=The Big Money |date=2009-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616131337/http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/judgments/2009/06/08/cool-refreshing-legislation-philip-morris?page=full |archivedate=June 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Morris strongly supports FDA regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Lawsuits and constitutionality===
* On August 31, 2009, [[Commonwealth Brands]] filed suit (Commonwealth Brands, Inc. v. United States) against the United States and the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. Alleging that the advertising restrictions embodied in the FSPTCA unconstitutionally infringe on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. These provisions include: restricting advertising to black-and-white text; restricting tobacco companies from advertising “light” cigarettes; prohibiting advertising within 1,000 feet of areas where children congregate; banning event sponsorship by tobacco companies; and prohibiting free sample distribution of cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/elj/60/60.3/Shechtman.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the FDA released nine new warning signs containing both graphic text and images that should be included on all cigarette packaging and advertisement by September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obama Chides Tobacco Cos. for Fighting Warning Labels |url=https://csnews.com/obama-chides-tobacco-cos-fighting-warning-labels |accessdate=19 October 2018 |work=Convenience Store News |date=17 November 2011 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The textual warnings state:
"WARNING: Cigarettes are addictive. 
WARNING: Tobacco smoke can harm your children.
WARNING: Cigarettes cause fatal lung disease.
WARNING: Cigarettes cause cancer.
WARNING: Cigarettes cause strokes and heart disease.
WARNING: Smoking during pregnancy can harm your baby.
WARNING: Smoking can kill you.
WARNING: Tobacco smoke causes fatal lung disease in nonsmokers.
WARNING: Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health."&lt;ref&gt;Act Section 201(a) (amending 15 U.S.C. Section 1333(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; 
Each warning is to be paired with one of the following colored images:  a man exhaling cigarette smoke through a tracheotomy hole in his throat; a plume of cigarette smoke enveloping an infant receiving a kiss from his or her mother; a pair of diseased lungs next to a pair of healthy lungs; a diseased mouth afflicted with what appears to be cancerous lesions; a man breathing into an oxygen mask; a bare-chested male cadaver lying on a table, and featuring what appears to be post-autopsy chest staples down the middle of his torso; a woman weeping uncontrollably; or a man wearing a T-shirt that features a "no smoking" symbol and the words "I Quit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=R.J.

* BBK Tobacco &amp; Foods, LLP v. U.S. Food and Drug Admin., the plaintiffs argued that flavored rolling papers, as utilized in the process of [[roll-your-own]]-tobacco cigarettes, did not qualify as tobacco products under the FSPTCA &lt;ref name="lawlib"&gt;http://lawlib.wlu.edu/lexopus/works/944-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lorillard Inc. filed lawsuit in the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]] and was joined by [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco]] Co., Commonwealth Brands Inc. and Liggett Group LLC, challenging the constitutionality of the FSPTCA, regarding free speech in advertising claims &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9P5GA900.htm|title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?|website=www.businessweek.com|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitutionality of the provision requiring graphic warnings on cigarette packs has been questioned with tobacco companies and others saying that the new warnings violated the first amendment by going beyond being informational and require manufactures of a legal product to "engage in anti-smoking advocacy" on the government's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/08/us-fda-tobacco-idUSTRE7A63V120111108 | work=Reuters | title=U.S. judge blocks graphic cigarette warnings | date=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[R.J. Reynolds]], [[Lorillard]], [[Liggett Group]] and [[Commonwealth Brands]], filed a lawsuit against the FDA in August 2011. It should be noted that [[Altria]] did not take any legal action. On November 7, 2011, US district judge [[Richard J. Leon|Richard Leon]] granted a temporary injunction postponing the implementation of the new warnings, ruling that "It is abundantly clear from viewing these images that the emotional response they were crafted to induce is calculated to provoke the viewer to quit, or never to start smoking - an objective wholly apart from disseminating purely factual and uncontroversial information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wilson |first1=Duff |title=Court Blocks Graphic Labels on Cigarette Packs |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/health/policy/court-blocks-graphic-labels-on-cigarette-packs.html?mtrref=undefined&amp;gwh=349E8F4DAD948C411E05388E9FF9FF58 |accessdate=19 October 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=7 November 2011 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Appeals for the D.C.

===International litigation===
On 12 April 2010, Indonesia filed a formal complaint with the World Trade Organization stating the ban on [[kretek]]s (clove cigarettes) in America amounts to discrimination because menthol cigarettes are exempt from the new regulation. Trade Ministry Director General of International Trade Gusmardi Bustami has stated that the Indonesian government has asked the WTO panel to review US violations on trade regulations, including the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) 1994, Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement. The TBT Agreement is of special importance as it defines clove cigarettes and menthol cigarettes as "like products." Claims of discrimination are enhanced when noting that 99% of kreteks were imported from countries other than the United States (chiefly Indonesia), while menthol cigarettes are produced almost entirely by American tobacco manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/07/21/wto-agrees-set-panel-rule-us-clove-cigarette-ban.html|title=WTO agrees to set up panel to rule on US clove cigarette ban|date=21 July 2010|publisher=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia's case is further strengthened by comparing the number of young kretek smokers in America with the number of young menthol cigarette smokers. According to US health reports, 43% of young smokers smoke menthol cigarettes, which accounts for nearly 25% of the total cigarette consumption in the United States. Young smokers habituated to kreteks, however, account for less than 1% of cigarette consumption in the US, and &lt;1% of the total cigarettes sold in the US. On 4 April 2012, the WTO ruled in favor of Indonesia's claim, though it is unclear how this will affect U.S. law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/04/us-wto-usa-indonesia-idUSBRE8330Y720120404|title=WTO dents U.S. ban on clove cigarettes|last=Miles|first=Tom|author2=Doug Palmer|date=4 April 2012|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Wilson Albee''' (December 20, 1921 &amp;ndash; July 8, 2006) was a pioneer in [[clinical psychology]], who believed societal factors such as unemployment, racism, sexism, and all the myriad forms of exploitation of people by people were the major cause of mental illness. He was one of  the leading figures in the development of [[community psychology]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Career==
Albee was born in [[St. Marys, Pennsylvania]], he attended [[Bethany College (West Virginia)|Bethany College]] and graduated in 1943. He was drafted into the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] until the end of [[World War II]].

After leaving the forces he attended the [[University of Pittsburgh]] where he attained his Masters and Doctorate degrees. Having received his doctorate in 1949 he spent the next two years in a research appointment at [[Western Psychiatric Institute]].  From 1951 to 1953 Albee worked for the Central Office of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA).&lt;ref name = Exploring&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953 Albee went to [[Finland]] for a year as a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] scholar, before returning to the USA to become a Professor at [[Case Western Reserve University]], a post he held for 16 years.&lt;ref name=Albee&gt; https://www.rhodeslab.org/files/mentorgeorgeAlbee.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;  In 1971 Albee left Case Western for a position at the [[University of Vermont]]. He remained here until his retirement in 1991. During that time, he married Constance Impallaria,and had 4 kids: Alec, Luke, Maud and Sarah.

During his career Albee was the author of groundbreaking studies in the 50's and 60's, that showed societal factors such as poverty, racism, sexism and child abuse, were to a large degree responsible for mental illness. He believed the psychological profession needed to focus more on prevention, rather than one to one treatment.  After his retirement Albee spent time travelling around the world giving lectures on psychology as well as writing a humor column for his local newspaper the ''[[Longboat Observer]]''.

From 1969-70 Albee was the president of the APA.  During his tenure he negotiated conflicts between the mainstream of psychology and the demands of [[Black people|Black]] and female psychologists.&lt;ref name = Exploring/&gt;

He was the author of more than 200 articles and book chapters on community approaches to mental illness, as well as writing more than a dozen books.

Albee died in [[Longboat Key, Florida]].

==Positions and awards==
*Served on [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower's]] and [[Jimmy Carter|Carter's]] Presidential Commissions on mental health.
*From 1969 &amp;ndash; 1970 Albee was the President of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA)&lt;ref name = Exploring/&gt;
*1973 received the APA Distinguished Professional Contribution Award.
*1993 awarded the [[American Psychological Foundation]] (APF) Gold Medal.

Dr '''George Kellie''' MD, FRSE (1770–1829)  was a Scottish surgeon who, together with [[Alexander Monro (secundus)|Alexander Monro]] ''secundus'' gave his name to the '''Monro-Kellie doctrine''', a concept which relates intracranial pressure to the volume of intracranial contents and is a basic tenet of our understanding of the neuropathology of raised [[intracranial pressure]]. The doctrine states that since the skull is incompressible, and the volume inside the skull is fixed then any increase in volume of one of the cranial constituents must be compensated by a decrease in volume of another.
Previous research about George Kellie (1720–1779) may have been hampered by a widely cited incorrect year of birth, by the spelling of his name as Kellie or Kelly and by confusion with his father, also a surgeon in Leith, with the same name and subject to similar spelling variations.

== Early life ==

George Kellie was born in [[Leith]], the seaport for Edinburgh which was at that time the fifth largest town in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;[http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/the-census/Webster_final.pdf Webster Census] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122013618/http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/the-census/Webster_final.pdf |date=22 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents George Kellie (1742–1805), originally from [[Dunbar]], East Lothian, and Catherin [sic] McCall of [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]], East Lothian had married in South Leith in August 1769&lt;ref name="Scotland's People"&gt;[http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk Scotland's People]&lt;/ref&gt; On his baptismal entry in the parish of Dunbar, East Lothian for 6 October 1742 George senior's surname is spelt Kellie, as is that of '''his''' father. In the South Leith parish records of his marriage to Catherin McCall in August 1764 and the record of the birth of his son, the spelling is given as 'Kelly'.&lt;ref name="Scotland's People"/&gt; George Kellie senior practised as a surgeon and while there is no record of his registration as a surgical apprentice in Wallis's extensive listing of British medical and surgical apprentices that listing showed that he trained three apprentices between 1771–75.&lt;ref name="Wallis"&gt;Wallis PJ, Wallis R, Whittet T. Eighteenth century medics: subscriptions, licenses, apprenticeships. Newcastle. University of Newcastle. 1985
&lt;/ref&gt; The Street directories for Edinburgh and Leith for the years 1773–1805 show that ‘George Kelly’ senior practised as a surgeon in Tolbooth Wynd, Leith, the only Kelly or Kellie listed in Leith for that period. In 1774 he published a paper describing a case of extensive [[surgical emphysema]] which, after consulting with [[Alexander Monro secundus]], he had successfully treated by inserting of a cannula into the thoracic cavity.&lt;ref&gt;Kellie G., An Account of the Paracentesis Being Performed in the Thorax for the Cure of an Emphysema, Medical and Philosophical commentaries 1774;2:427-3&lt;/ref&gt; George Kelly senior died at Leith on 3 April 1805, the spelling of his name on the death notice reverting to 'Kellie'.&lt;ref name="Scotland's People"/&gt;
George Kellie junior followed his father into a career as a surgeon in Leith after serving a five year apprenticeship to the Edinburgh surgeon James Arrott (1760–1818).&lt;ref name="Wallis"/&gt;

== Naval service ==

As Arrott had done before him Kellie joined the Royal Navy in 1790 as a surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;The Edinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany 1818;81:500&lt;/ref&gt; During this naval service he published papers in the form of letters to his father ‘Mr Kellie, surgeon, Leith’. A letter to ''Edinburgh Medical Commentaries'' dated  21 May 1794 show  that he is now surgeon on HMS ''Iris'', a 32 gun, fifth rate frigate. In this letter he records experiments on himself, describing the effects of compressing the arm by tourniquet.&lt;ref&gt;Kellie G. An account of the effects of compression by the tourniquet in stopping the cold fits of intermittents. Edinburgh Medical Commentaries 1794;9:271-83&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1796 he was posted to HMS ''Leopard'', a 50 gun fourth rate warship. In the next month he writes to the ''Annals of Medicine'' about the anatomy of the shark &lt;ref&gt;Kellie G. Some observations on the anatomy of the shark. Annals of Medicine 1796;1:395&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year writes with more information about tourniquet compression.&lt;ref&gt;Kellie G. Observations on the medical effects of compression by tourniquet. Annals of Medicine 1797;2:127&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to the ''Annals'' in 1801 from a Mr Livingstone, Kellie is described as ‘physician to the English prisoners at [[Valenciennes|Valencienne]]’, a reference to the town in the Pas de Calais in northern France where British prisoners of war were held during the Napoleonic War.&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone J. Observations on the benefits derived from compression by the tourniquet. Annals of Medicine 1801;1:313-5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Return to Leith ==

When Kellie returned to surgical practice in Leith he maintained his military links by becoming Surgeon to the Royal Leith Volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;London Gazette 23 August 1803 issue 15614&lt;/ref&gt; In 1802 he became a fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] (RCSEd) and was elected a Burgess of the [[Edinburgh|City of Edinburgh]], a necessary prerequisite to practise as a surgeon-apothecary.&lt;ref&gt;Boog Watson CB, ed. Roll of Edinburgh burgesses and guild-brethren, 1761–1841. Edinburgh: Scottish Record Society; 1933&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 September 1803 he graduated MD from the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] with a thesis entitled ‘de Electricitate animale’, by now obviously able to pay the graduation fee. On 21 November 1805 he married Ann Wight, daughter of Robert Wight of the Murrays near [[Ormiston]] in East Lothian, maintaining his family links with that region.&lt;ref name="Scotland's People"/&gt; He now published a series of papers on a diverse range of medical and surgical topics.&lt;ref&gt;Macintyre I. A hotbed of medical innovation: George Kellie (1770–1829), his colleagues at Leith and the Monro–Kellie doctrine J Med Biogr 0967772013479271 16 September 2013 doi:10.1177/0967772013479271&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paper on intracranial circulation ==

In the paper which was to give Kellie lasting eponymous fame he describes the post mortem appearances in the bodies of two individuals found dead after lying outside after a storm.&lt;ref&gt;Kellie G. An account of the appearances observed in the dissection of two of three individuals presumed to have perished in the storm of the 3rd, and whose bodies were discovered in the vicinity of Leith on the morning of the 4th, November 1821 : with some reflections on the pathology of the brain. Transactions of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh 1824;1:82–169&lt;/ref&gt; He was asked by local magistrates to try to establish the cause of death. Kellie noted that the veins in the meninges and surface of the brain were congested and the associated arteries were relatively bloodless while the brain was otherwise normal. In concluding that the individuals died from exposure he quotes a similar case described by Samuel Quelmalz (1696–1758) where exposure results in a progression through weariness, lassitude, drowsiness, coma and death which he ascribes to disordered cerebral circulation. He concluded 'When the cavity of the cranium is encroached upon by depression of its walls compensation may be made at the expense of circulatory fluid within the head; less blood is admitted and circulated'. Kellie gave credit to two of his Edinburgh contemporaries for their contributions in the shaping of this concept, [[Alexander Monro (secundus)|Alexander Monro ''secundus'']] (' … my illustrious preceptor in anatomy, the second Monro') and [[John Abercrombie (physician)|John Abercrombie]]. Monro had stated that since the healthy cranial cavity is rigid and of constant volume and the brain 'is nearly incompressible, the quantity of blood within the head must remain the same'.&lt;ref&gt;Monro A. Observations on the structure and functions of the nervous system: illustrated with tables. Edinburgh: Printed for, and sold by, William Creech 1783&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the paper Kellie described how Monro, aware of his interest, invited him jointly to examine the brains of executed criminals and sent him descriptions of autopsy findings in other similar cases. He gives Abercrombie particular credit when he writes  'the argument has already been taken up and illustrated by Dr Abercrombie, in his ingenious analysis of apoplexy … '. In 1818 Abercrombie indeed had ‘proposed a doctrine’ clearly setting out the hypothesis.
Abercrombie  was largely responsible for the doctrine becoming widely known and accepted around the world. His authoritative book ''Pathological and Practical Researches on Disease of the Brain and Spinal Cord'' first published in 1828 was a milestone in neuropathology which ran to three British, two American and French and German editions.&lt;ref&gt;Abercrombie J. Pathological and practical researches on disease of the brain and spinal cord. Edinburgh: J Carfrae; 1828&lt;/ref&gt; In it Abercrombie linked the theories of Monro and Kellie and gave them full credit for the hypothesis

== Testing the doctrine ==

As Abercrombie had done before him, Kellie went on to test his theories with a series of animal experiments where he studied the cerebral circulation of sheep and of dogs immediately after exsanguination or death induced by cyanide. He found that in many instances while the tissues outwith the cranium were drained of blood, the brain was not affected in this way, retaining blood volume. He concluded that where the circulating blood volume was depleted, the volume circulating within the cranium remained constant, with the increase in arterial tone and consequent reduction in arterial blood volume being compensated by venous engorgement thus keeping the total blood volume constant. 
The English physician [[Sir George Burrows, 1st Baronet|Dr (later Sir) George Burrows]] (1801–1887) later tested the hypothesis with CSF included in the equation.&lt;ref&gt;	Burrows G. On disorders of the cerebral circulation and on the connection between affections of the brain and diseases of the heart. London: Longman; 1846&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated Kellie’s experiments using animal exsanguination and concluded that a depletion of CSF volume was compensated by an increase in intracranial blood volume and vice versa, so validating the hypothesis.
[[Harvey Cushing]] (1869–1939)and his researcher Lewis Weed (1886–1952) tested the theory in the light of increasing knowledge and Weed found that ' ... in every way Monro-Kellie doctrine must be considered essentially correct'.&lt;ref&gt;Weed L. Some limitations of the Monro–Kellie hypothesis. Archives of surgery 1929;18&lt;/ref&gt; The development of techniques to measure [[cerebral blood flow]] (CBF) and [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP) have allowed more sophisticated testing of the doctrine and shown that the hypothesis formulated by Monro, Kellie and Abercrombie still holds good.&lt;ref&gt;Mokri B. The Monro-Kellie hypothesis: applications in CSF volume depletion. Neurology 2001;56:1746-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==

Kellie went on to achieve local distinction in his lifetime. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in December 1823. In 1827 he was elected President of the [[Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society]] and was succeeded in that office by [[John Abercrombie (physician)|John Abercrombie]].
George Kellie collapsed and died in Leith on 28 September 1829 while on his way home from visiting a patient.&lt;ref&gt;Martine J. Reminiscences of port and town of Leith. Edinburgh: Printed for the author, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Got Mercury?''' is a public awareness campaign about [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] levels in [[seafood]]. It is sponsored by the [[Sea Turtle Restoration Project]] (STRP) and its parent organization, the [[Turtle Island Restoration Network]] (TIRN).  The name of the campaign is a [[snowclone]] of the successful [[Got Milk?]] advertising campaign.

==History==
Although the STRP was founded to protect sea turtles in their natural habitats, the organization began the Got Mercury? campaign in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.seaturtles.org/article.php?list=type&amp;type=48 |title= GotMercury.Org |work= Sea Turtle Restoration Project|accessdate= 2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign advocates that [[supermarket]]s and [[restaurant]]s post warning signs about mercury contamination in [[seafood]], require them to regularly screen seafood for levels of mercury under one [[part per million]] and that species that contain the "highest levels of mercury" should be removed from the shelves. In 2004, the organization created an online mercury seafood calculator, one that was mimicked by the free market [[Center for Consumer Freedom]] not long thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.commondreams.org/news2004/0310-02.htm |title=  Got Mercury? Online Calculator Helps Seafood Consumers Gauge Mercury Intake |date= March 9, 2004 |work= [[Common Dreams]]|accessdate= 2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 2008, Got Mercury? issued a report entitled, ''Mercury in Seafood: No Fair Warning'', which included these findings:&lt;ref&gt;[http://seaturtles.org/downloads/NoFairWarning308.pdf ''Mercury in Seafood: No Fair Warning''] (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mercury levels of swordfish and tuna tested from California markets often exceeded the FDA limit of 1 ppm.
* Several California restaurant chains were chronically out of compliance with [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|California Proposition 65]] which requires restaurants serving mercury-contaminated seafood to post consumer advisory warnings.
* About 70% of California supermarkets did not have adequate signage to warn consumers about mercury-contaminated seafood.

Shortly after the release of the report, the [[National Fisheries Institute]] issued a press advisory urging reporters to disregard the report on the basis that it might cause public harm by leading individuals, including mothers and children, to consume less fish and lose the benefits from [[omega-3]] fatty acids that can be important to early childhood development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aboutseafood.com/press/press-releases/enviro-lobbyists-push-prop65-scare-story-encourage-seafood-deficient-diet |title= Enviro-Lobbyists Push Prop65 Scare Story, Encourage Seafood-Deficient Diet |date= March 27, 2008 |accessdate= 2008-03-30 |publisher= [[National Fisheries Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, the group secretly tested samples of seafood bought from California retailers. The group tested swordfish, tuna, halibut, and salmon for traces of methylmercury. The results of the study showed that tuna and swordfish purchased from some supermarkets and sushi restaurants contained as much as three times the FDA limit for mercury contamination. Representatives of the seafood industry criticized the report, arguing that it might lead consumers to eat less seafood and thus be detrimental to public health. Pamela Tom, manager of the seafood extension program at the [[University of California at San Diego]] also noted that no cases of methylmercury poisoning have been found from fish documented with the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/01/18/MN6H1H8NRN.DTL |title= Group secretly tests mercury in tuna, swordfish |first= Kelly |last= Zito |work= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date= January 18, 2011 |accessdate= January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
Currently, the Turtle Island Restoration Network provides organizational support for the STRP, Got Mercury?, as well as the SPAWN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seaturtles.org/downloads/STRPAnnualRep2007.pdf |format=PDF |title=2007 Annual Report |work=Sea Turtle Restoration Project |date=June 9, 2008 |accessdate=2009-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707092433/http://www.seaturtles.org/downloads/STRPAnnualRep2007.pdf |archivedate=July 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1999 and 2008, the Turtle Island Restoration Network has received $93,000 from the Foundation for Deep Ecology, an organization founded by fashion executive [[Douglas Tompkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.capitalresearch.org/pubs/pdf/FW1005.pdf |title=Deep Ecology, Depthless Thinking |first=Philip J. |last=Maslar |author2=David Hogberg |work=[http://www.capitalresearch.org Capital Research Center] |accessdate=2008-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821105223/http://www.capitalresearch.org/pubs/pdf/FW1005.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tunnel construction==
[[File:Haikou Nandu River Water Diversion Project - tunnel access pit - 01.jpg|thumb|left|One of the many access pit showing tunnel]]
The project is ongoing in 2017 and includes a pumping station on the east bank of the Nandu River just south of the [[Longtang Dam]]. Tunnels are being bored from the west side of the Nandu westward to the areas where the water is needed. This involves underground blasting and the creation of numerous pits along the route for equipment access.

'''Health Insurance Fund (HIF)''' is an [[Australian]], not-for-profit insurer. In 1954 it was brought into existence as the WA Government Employee’s Hospital and Medical Benefits Fund Incorporated. But has since undergone a series of name changes to better reflect the scope and services it provides.&lt;ref&gt;''HIF Corporate Structure and Governance Homepage:''http://www.hif.com.au/about-us/corporate-structure.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''HIF Annual Report, June 2013'' http://www.hif.com.au/sites/hifcomau/assets/public/File/2012_HIF_Annual_Financial_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

HIF has majority market share for health funds in Western Australia. Its business model boasts a strong environmental focus. Currently, it is the only certified carbon neutral health fund in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;''Carbon Reduction Institute:'' http://www.noco2.com.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
HIF (Health Insurance Fund of Australia) began in 1954 as the [[Western Australian Government Railways]] Employees’ Hospital and Medical Fund. Within a few months this name was changed to the Government Employees’ Hospital and Medical Benefits Fund Incorporated.
In 1978, to comply with the Associations Incorporations Act 1895 (WA), HIF became the Health Insurance Fund of WA. In 2010, the fund changed its name to Health Insurance Fund Of [[Australia]] Limited to reflect its nationally expanding client base. Also in 2010, data published by the Private Health Insurance Administration Council (PHIAC) revealed HIF to be the fastest growing not-for-profit Australian health fund for that financial year.

==Legal structure alterations==

===Legal structure prior to 2010===
In 2008, the Federal Government passed the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 (Cth) (PHILA Act); seeking to amend the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 (Cth). This legislation governs the operation of all private health insurers. The PHILA Act required all insurers to qualify as a ‘company’ as stipulated by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). As a result of this, on December 1, 2009, the [[Western Australian Government]] passed legislation facilitating the transfer of HIF’s status from an incorporated association under the Associations Incorporations Act 1987 (WA) to an Australian public company.

===Legal structure today===
Today HIF is an Australian public company limited by guarantee and governed by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). HIF is registered with the federal regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Private Health Insurance Administration Council (PHIAC) as an open access, not for profit, private, health insurer.&lt;ref&gt;''Private Health Insurance Act 2007 (Cth):'' http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/phia2007248/&lt;/ref&gt;

Private health insurance in Australia is heavily regulated. Prudential supervision is undertaken by PHIAC to ensure the company remains solvent. PHIAC publishes extensive statistics on the industry and annual financial statements for individual health funds. The pricing and features of health insurance products is regulated by the Department of Health and Ageing.&lt;ref&gt;''Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 (Cth) (PHILA Act):''http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill_em/philab2008450/memo_0.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company culture==
HIF holds the title of Australia’s first carbon neutral health fund, as certified by the Carbon Reduction Institute (CRI). From their analysis, HIF was able to construct and implement strategies to reduce their carbon footprint. After achieving significant reductions the company sought to offset remaining emissions through the purchase of carbon abatement credits. 
HIF is involved with multiple charitable works. One of these is the Amanda Young Foundation: A not-for-profit charity dedicated to reducing deaths from Meningococcal Disease. HIF provides the Amanda Young Foundation with accommodation, resources, and administrative and accounting support.&lt;ref&gt;''Amanda Young Foundation – Meningococcal Disease:'' http://www.amandayoungfoundation.org.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

HIF is strongly involved with SIDS &amp; Kids Western Australia. This charity’s mission is to save the lives of infants through education and research. HIF also provide support for those affected by the sudden and unexpected death of a child.
HIF sponsor a number of community initiatives, including:

*	The Amanda Young Foundation Charity Ball. An annual fundraising event in [[Perth]].
*	The Drug Aware Margaret River Pro Surfing Competition. An annual Western Australia surfing event.&lt;ref&gt;''Drug Aware Margaret River Pro Surfing Event:'' http://www.aspworldtour.com/events/mct/649/drug-aware-margaret-river-pro&lt;/ref&gt;
*	The SIDS and Kids Sunshine Beach Run. 
*	Premium sponsors for the [[Perth Wildcats]] basketball team.

The heat traps allow cold water to flow into the water heater tank, but prevent unwanted [[convection]] and heated water to flow out of the tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=13100 |title=Install Heat Traps on a Water Heater Tank for Energy Savings |author=Unknown |work=U.S. Department of Energy |publisher= |accessdate=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energycodes.gov/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=109 |title=Heat Traps |author=Unknown |work=Building Energy Codes Online Training |publisher= |accessdate=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer water heaters have built-in heat traps.

==About==
Many water-heating pieces of equipment have integral heat traps installed from the factory. For water-heating equipment that does not already have factory installed heat traps, they must be purchased then installed in the inlet and outlet connections.&lt;ref name="Heat Traps"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heat Traps|url=http://www.energycodes.gov/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=109|publisher=Building Energy Codes Online Training|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heat traps are very simple and inexpensive. They are an effective way to prevent cooling of hot water in water heaters by [[thermosyphoning]] the hot water to a higher elevated portion of the piping system. Thermosyphoning is based on natural convection. Hot water rises and is then displaced by cold water beneath it. The heat trap stops this process, thus keeping the hot water inside the insulated storage tank.&lt;ref name="Heat Traps" /&gt;

--&gt; It lies in the [[corneal epithelium]]. Usually it has about 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm in thickness and is 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm long. It is generally horizontal, with possible mild downward trend in the middle. It is present normally in people over the age of 50, but seems to dissipate to some degree by the age of 70.

The Hudson-Stahli line is not associated with any pathology calling for clinical intervention. Formation of the line may depend upon the rate of [[Tears|tear]] secretion.&lt;!--

The '''International Food Policy Research Institute''' ('''IFPRI''') is an international agricultural research center founded in the early 1970s to improve the understanding of national agricultural and food policies to promote the adoption of innovations in agricultural technology. Additionally, IFPRI was meant to shed more light on the role of agricultural and rural development in the broader development pathway of a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Partner: International Food Policy Research Institute |publisher=WorldFish |url=http://www.worldfishcenter.org/international-food-policy-research-institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= IFPRI, Washington DC, United States, Bjorn Van Campenhout, Research Fellow |date=2016-07-01 |publisher=BioHorizon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPMR4"&gt;CGIAR Science Council Secretariat. 2006.

IFPRI carries out food policy research and disseminates it through hundreds of publications, bulletins, conferences, and other initiatives. IFPRI was organized as a [[District of Columbia]] non-profit, non-stock corporation on March 5, 1975, and its first research bulletin was produced in February 1976.&lt;ref&gt;International Food Policy Research Institute.

Most of the research takes place in developing countries in [[Central America]], [[South America]], [[Africa]], and [[Asia]].

IFPRI is part of a network of international research institutes funded in part by the [[CGIAR]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Research Centers |publisher=CGIAR |url=http://www.cgiar.org/about-us/research-centers/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn is funded by governments, private businesses and foundations, and the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Scope==
IFPRI's institutional strategy rests on three pillars: research, capacity strengthening, and policy communication.&lt;ref name="com"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/book-763/ourwork/division/communications Communications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616110654/http://www.ifpri.org/book-763/ourwork/division/communications |date=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research areas===
Research topics have included low crop and animal productivity, and [[environmental degradation]], [[water management]], fragile lands, [[property rights]], [[collective action]], sustainable intensification of agricultural production, the impact of [[climate change]] on poor farmers, the problems and opportunities of [[biotechnology]],&lt;ref name="ept"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/division/environment-and-production-technology-eptd Environment and Production Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; [[food security]], [[micronutrient]] [[malnutrition]], [[microfinance]] programs, urban food security, resource allocation within households,&lt;ref name="phn"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/division/poverty-health-and-nutrition-phnd Poverty, Health, and Nutrition]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[school feeding in low-income countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adelman|first=Sarah|title=How Effective Are Food for Education Programs?

====Gender and development====
One major area of research is [[gender and development]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vyawahare |first=Malavika |title=Are Men Useless? (Government Says Yes) |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 9, 2012 |url=http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/are-men-useless-government-says-yes/}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study, conducted in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], looked at the relative productivity of plots of farm land controlled by men compared to plots controlled by women. They found that the majority of resources are devoted to plots controlled by men, but if resources were diverted to plots controlled by women productivity could increase by as much as 20%. In another study in [[Kenya]], where women get almost no education, they determined that if women farmers were provided one year of primary education, maize production could increase by as much as 24%.&lt;ref name="wkfs"&gt;{{cite web |author=|title="Women, the Key to Food Security" |publisher=IFPRI |date=June 2000 |url=http://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/125453/filename/125454.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2017}}

Studies conducted in [[Egypt]] and [[Mozambique]] found that the education level of adult females in a household is more important than the education level of adult males to bring a household out of poverty. Increasing the education of mothers to completion of primary school decreased the percentage of households below the poverty line by 33.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Datt |first=Gaurav |last2=Jolliffe |first2=Dean |date=October 1999 |title=Determinants of Poverty in Egypt: 1997 |publisher=IFPRI |url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/dp75.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}}{{failed verification|date=April 2017|reason=Search for 33.7, nothing found}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Datt |first=Guarav |author2=Kenneth R.

The funds were more likely to be spent on children's clothes, education and general well being for both girls and boys.&lt;ref name="wkfs" /&gt;

====Climate change====
One of the areas of research for the IFPRI is the effects of [[climate change]] on developing countries. Climate change describes a global change in the climate, but this does not mean that all areas of the globe will be affected equally or that they will all experience the same type of climate change. Some areas may become warmer while others may become colder. The IFPRI has conducted studies to model the effects of climate change on developing populations.

In 2011, IFPRI published the results of a study in The Republic of [[Yemen]] predicting the economic outcome of climate change in [[urban area|urban]] and [[rural]] Yemeni communities. The study predicted that the country's [[GDP]] would drop, but that agricultural GDP would increase. It predicted that flooding would cause farmers to lose some crops, but agriculture in general would benefit. The group expected to suffer the most would be rural non-farmers. In the long term, climate change was predicted to damage [[food security]] and cause a decrease in household GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wiebelt |first=Manfred |author2=Clemens Breisinger |author3=Olivier Ecker |author4=Perrihan Al-Riffai |author5=Richard D. Robertson |author6=Rainer Thiele |title=Climate change and floods in Yemen: Impacts on food security and options for adaptation" |publisher=IFPRI |year=2011 |url=http://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/126748/filename/126959.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}}

In December 2011, the IFPRI published a report sent to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) highlighting the need for research into agricultural systems likely to be affected by climate change. They highlighted 12 that they suggested should be high research priority:&lt;ref name= unfccc&gt;Beachy, Roger, et al. "Fighting Hunger in a Changing Climate: How Can Agriculture Respond?"

====Malnutrition====
IFPRI has done extensive research into areas related to [[malnutrition]]. They have conducted research all over the world on various issues that arise from or cause malnutrition. They have looked at [[HIV]] and [[Malaria]] and how malnutrition affects the [[epidemiology]] of these diseases. They have looked at the effects of childhood malnutrition on adult health. They have looked at the potential benefits of [[biotech]] crops on childhood nutrition, and the effects of vitamin supplements in general.

A study in [[Ethiopia]] to test cost effectiveness of two different methods of treating malnutrition in children was done by Tekeste Asayehegn. In the study the compared two different methods of long term care for the malnourished children. In the first method children were brought to Therapeutic Feeding Centers where they remained as in-patients. The alternative method involved the supplies to treat malnourished children being sent to local clinics and healthcare facilities where the children were brought on a weekly or fortnight basis for treatment. The nutritional supplements were then sent home with the children. Volunteers checked on the patients at home and brought them to the facilities for treatment. This localized treatment program was found to cut the cost of treating a malnourished child in half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tekeste |first=Asayehegn |author2=Mekitie Wondafrash |author3=Girma Azene |author4=Kebede Deribe |title=Cost effectiveness of community-based and in-patient therapeutic feeding programs to treat severe acute malnutrition in Ethiopia |journal=Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation |date=March 19, 2012 |doi=10.1186/1478-7547-10-4 |pmc=3323427 |pmid=22429892 |volume=10 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Uganda the IFPRI conducted a study on the relationship between malnutrition and the incidences of malaria. There were two variables in the study the first was evidence of [[malnutrition]] in the child and the second was whether or not the child was infected with [[HIV]]. The study indicated that there may be a correlation between malnutrition and increased risk of malaria. Both the HIV-negative and positive patients that were malnourished showed higher rates of [[malaria]] than the groups with better nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arinaitwe |first=Emmanuel |author2=''et al.'' |title=The association between malnutrition and the incidence of malaria among young HIV-infected and -uninfected Ugandan children: a prospective study |journal=[[Malaria Journal]] |date=March 27, 2012 |doi=10.1186/1475-2875-11-90 |pmc=3337276 |pmid=22453048 |volume=11 |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transgenic crops====
IFPRI neither supports nor opposes [[genetically modified foods]]; however, they have released many publications on the potential impact of using [[transgenic crops]]. There are many types of transgenic crops. Some modify the plant's ability to produce natural pesticides while others affect the nutritional value of the crops themselves. In 2009 IFPRI released a publication that was an overview of the use of [[biotech]] crops between 1997 and 2007. Since the institute maintains a neutral standpoint on the subject, they chose the term "biotech" as being less inflammatory than "genetically modified" or "transgenic".&lt;ref name="meitc"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smale |first=Melinda |author2=''et al.'' |title=Measuring the economic impacts of transgenic crops in developing agriculture during the first decade |publisher=IFPRI |year=2009 |url=https://www.ifpri.org/cdmref/p15738coll2/id/26575/filename/26576.pdf |pages=xiii–xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication was a review of many studies conducted during the ten-year time period in several countries around the world.

They observed that many of the studies were inconclusive in terms of the economic value of a crop. For instance, the studies showed conclusively that the use of [[Bt cotton]] reduced the need for pesticide treatment and increased crop yield, but they did not show whether it increased profits for the small farms involved.&lt;ref name="meitc" /&gt; They determined that the information provided to the consumer was important in these studies. Negative messages were very effective at dissuading use.

Overall, the researchers determined that some strains of biotech crops were economically promising especially in countries like [[India]] and [[China]]. They were unwilling to make too strong a judgment on the data provided recommending better studies be conducted over the following ten years to obtain a more complete understanding of the economic effects of biotech crops in developing countries.&lt;ref name="meitc" /&gt; This publication made no observations about potential environmental or health related issues involved with the crops. It simply dealt with potential profits and economic impact.

IFPRI also analyzes agricultural market reforms, trade policy, [[World Trade Organization]] negotiations in the context of agriculture, institutional effectiveness, crop and income diversification, postharvest activity, and [[Intensive farming|agroindustry]].&lt;ref name="mti"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/division/markets-trade-and-institutions-mtid "Markets, Trade, and Institutions (MTID)"], IFPRI.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute is involved in measuring the [[Millennium Development Goals]] project and supports governments in the formulation and implementation of development strategies.&lt;ref name="dsg"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/division/development-strategy-and-governance-dsgd "Development Strategy and Governance (DSGD)"], IFPRI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further work includes research on agricultural [[innovation system]]s and the role of capacity strengthening in agricultural development.&lt;ref name="kci"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/book-36/ourwork/division/knowledge-capacity-and-innovation Knowledge, Capacity, and Innovation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626075634/http://www.ifpri.org/book-36/ourwork/division/knowledge-capacity-and-innovation |date=June 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Products and publications===
IFPRI targets its policy and research products to many audiences, including developing-country policymakers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and civil-society organizations, "opinion leaders", donors, advisers, and media.

Publications by IFPRI include books, research reports, but also newsletters, briefs, and fact sheets,&lt;ref&gt;IFPRI's [http://www.ifpri.org/publications Publications &amp; Tools]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2017}} which are also available from IFPRI's Knowledge Repository.&lt;ref&gt;http://ebrary.ifpri.org/&lt;/ref&gt; It is also involved in the collection of primary data and the compilation and processing of secondary data.&lt;ref&gt;http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/IFPRI&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.ifpri.org/topic/global-food-policy-report Global Food Policy Report] is one of IFPRI's flagship publications. To meet the needs of policy makers and researchers interested in food security and nutrition, this annual report offers an overview of recent food policy developments that have contributed to or hindered progress in reducing hunger and improving nutrition. It reviews what happened in food policy and why, examines key challenges and opportunities, shares new evidence and knowledge, updates key food policy indicators, and highlights emerging issues. The 2017 Report takes an in-depth look at how rapid urbanization is reshaping food systems and its impact on food security and nutrition for rural and urban populations, focusing on policies to improve rural-urban linkages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifpri.org/book-9464/ourwork/researcharea/global-food-policy-report |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216080825/http://www.ifpri.org/book-9464/ourwork/researcharea/global-food-policy-report |archivedate=February 16, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 IFPRI introduced the [[2020 Vision Initiative]],&lt;ref name="2020 Vision Initiative"&gt;[https://www.ifpri.org/program/2020-vision 2020 Vision]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2017|reason=Doesn't say when introduced}} which aims at coordinating and supporting a debate among national governments, nongovernmental organizations, the private sector, international development institutions, and other elements of civil society to reach food security for all by 2020.

As of 2006 IFPRI produces the [[Global Hunger Index]] (GHI)&lt;ref name="Global Hunger Index"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/search?keyword=%22Global+Hunger+Index%22 Search IFPRI Web:Global Hunger Index]&lt;/ref&gt; yearly measuring the progress and failure of individual countries and regions in the fight against hunger. The GHI is a collaboration of IFPRI, the [[Welthungerhilfe]], and [[Concern Worldwide]].&lt;ref name="Millions Fed Book"&gt;David J. Spielman, Rajul Pandya-Lorch, [http://www.ifpri.org/publication/millions-fed Millions Fed: Proven Successes in Agricultural Development], IFPRI.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The evaluation of policy-oriented research poses a lot of challenges including the difficulty to quantify the impact of knowledge and ideas in terms of reduced poverty and or increased income or the attribution of a change in these numbers to a specific study or research project.&lt;ref name="CGImpact"&gt;Mitch Renkow and Derek Byerlee. 2010. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2010.04.006 The impacts of CGIAR research: A review of recent evidence], Food Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these challenges, studies find that IFPRI research had spill-over effects for specific country-level research, but also in setting the global policy agenda, for example in the areas biodiversity (influencing the [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources]]) and trade (with respect to the [[Doha Development Round]] of trade negotiations).&lt;ref name="CGImpact" /&gt;

Another example of IFPRI's impact on policy formulation was the [[2007–2008 world food price crisis]]. IFPRI was able to quickly pull together relevant research and its resulting recommendations were included in the United Nations' Comprehensive Framework for Action on food security.&lt;ref name="foodcrises"&gt;Klaus von Grebmer and Ingeborg Hovland. 2009. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1332/174426409X463910 "Using 'systems awareness': a proposed mechanism for monitoring communications"], ''Evidence &amp; Policy: A Journal of Research, Debate and Practice''.&lt;/ref&gt;

IFPRI leads a number of partnerships that engage different stakeholders to influence policies with an impact on poverty, hunger and food situation of poor people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/topic/ifpri-programs IFPRI-led Policy Programs and Partnerships]&lt;/ref&gt; The newest of these initiatives is [http://www.compact2025.org/ Compact2025], a partnership that develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ifpri.org/publication/compact-2025-ending-hunger-and-undernutrition "Compact2025: Ending hunger and undernutrition"]], 2015. Project Paper. IFPRI: Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[CGIAR]] and its agencies, including IFPRI, have been criticized for their connections to Western governments and [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[agribusiness]]. Its research publications have also been cited by critics of [[genetically modified organism]]s in agriculture. IFPRI describes itself as "neither an advocate nor an opponent of [[genetically modified crops]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/ourwork/about/biotech-biosafety?print Note from the Director General] Biotech and Biosafety Policy, Balancing Biotechnology and Biosafety (n.d.){{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many sources recognize CGIAR as having support of smallholders and poor farmers central to its mission.&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist''. (February 18, 2012) [http://www.economist.com/node/21547771/ "The nutrition puzzle: Why do so many people in poor countries eat so badly—and what can be done about it?"] "Marie Ruel, of the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington, D.C., ticks off some of the tasks: focus on the first 1,000 days of life (including pregnancy); scale up maternal-health programmes and the teaching of good feeding practices; concentrate on the poor; measure and monitor the problem."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tran, Mark. (2011-09-02) [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/sep/02/east-africa-crisis-investment-pastoralists? "Investment in pastoralists could help combat east Africa food crisis"] ''The Guardian''. "The ILRI, based in Nairobi, is a proponent of pastoralism and asserts that herding in dry areas makes better economic sense than irrigation."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'' (April 23, 2000) [http://www.economist.com/node/295708 "Biting the silver bullet"] "CGIAR ... help poor farmers"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New Agriculturist'' (January 2007) [http://www.new-ag.info/en/view/point.php?a=1 "Confronting the Challenges of Change"] "The CGIAR has a very long and successful history of providing agricultural science for the benefit of poor people across the world, and that remains our core mission."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New Agriculturist'' (January 2005) [http://www.new-ag.info/en/pov/views.php?a=1268 "The CGIAR: A Bridge to the Future?"] "Tropical agriculture has benefited very significantly from the work of the CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research).... the CGIAR's impact, since its founding in the 1970s, is an estimated US$9 return on every US$1 invested."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the emotion|irritability}}
'''Irritation''', in [[biology]] and [[physiology]], is a state of [[inflammation]] or painful reaction to [[allergy]] or cell-lining damage. A stimulus or agent which induces the state of irritation is an '''irritant'''. Irritants are typically thought of as chemical agents (for example [[phenol]] and [[capsaicin]]) but mechanical, thermal (heat), and radiative stimuli (for example [[ultraviolet light]] or [[ionising radiation]]s) can also be irritants. Irritation also has non-clinical usages referring to bothersome physical or psychological [[pain]] or discomfort.

Irritation can also be induced by some allergic response due to exposure of some allergens for example contact dermatitis, irritation of mucosal membranes and pruritus. Mucosal membrane is the most common site of irritation because it contains secretory glands that release mucous which attracts the allergens due to its sticky nature.

Chronic irritation is a medical term signifying that afflictive health conditions have been present for a while. There are many disorders that can cause chronic irritation, the majority involve the skin, vagina, eyes and lungs.

==Irritation in organisms==
In higher organisms, an [[allergy|allergic response]] may be the cause of irritation. An [[allergen]] is defined distinctly from an irritant, however, as allergy requires a specific interaction with the [[immune system]] and is thus dependent on the (possibly unique) sensitivity of the organism involved while an irritant, classically, acts in a non-specific manner.

It is a form of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], but conversely, if one is stressed by unrelated matters, mild imperfections can cause more irritation than usual: one is '''irritable'''; see also [[sensitivity (human)]].

In more basic organisms, the status of [[pain]] is the [[perception]] of the being stimulated, which is not observable although it may be shared (see [[Pain#Gate control|gate control theory of pain]]).

[[File:Pearl oyster.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Pearl oyster]]]]
It is not proven that oysters can feel pain, but it is known that they react to irritants. When an irritating object becomes trapped within an oyster's shell, it deposits layers of calcium carbonate (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), slowly increasing in size and producing a [[pearl]]. This is purely a defense mechanism, to trap a potentially threatening irritant such as a parasite inside its shell, or an attack from outside, injuring the mantle tissue. The oyster creates a pearl sac to seal off the irritation.

It has also been observed that an amoeba avoids being prodded with a pin, but there is not enough evidence to suggest how much it feels this. Irritation is apparently the only universal [[sense]] shared by even single-celled creatures.

It is postulated that most such beings also feel pain, but this is a projection – [[empathy]]. Some philosophers, notably [[René Descartes]], denied it entirely, even for such higher [[mammal]]s as dogs or [[primate]]s like [[monkey]]s; Descartes considered [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] a pre-requisite for the feeling of pain.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

== Types ==

===Eye irritation===
[[File:Infant with blepharitis on the right side.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Infant with [[blepharitis]] on the right eye]]

Modern office work with use of office equipment has raised concerns about possible adverse health effects.&lt;ref&gt;Jaakkola, Maritta S. and Jouni J. K. Jaakkola. "Office Equipment and Supplies: A Modern Occupational Health Concern?", [[American Journal of Epidemiology]], 1999, pp. 1223, Vol. 150, No. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, reports have linked mucosal, skin, and general symptoms to work with self-copying paper. Emission of various particulate and volatile substances has been suggested as specific causes. These symptoms have been related to [[Sick Building Syndrome]], which involves symptoms such as irritation to the eyes, skin, and upper airways, headache and fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;Nordström K., D. Norbäck, and R. Akselsson. "Influence of indoor air quality and personal factors on the sick building syndrome (SBS) in Swedish geriatric hospitals.", Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 1995, pp. 170-176, Vol. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eye is also a source of chronic irritation. Disorders like [[Sjögren's syndrome]], where one does not make tears, can cause a dry eye sensation which feels very unpleasant. The condition is difficult to treat and is lifelong. Besides artificial tears, there is a drug called Restasis which may help.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dryeyeinfo.org/Dry_Eye_In_Depth.htm Dry Eye Diganosis And Treatment] Dry Eye Diagnosis And Treatment. Retrieved on 2010-01-12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blepharitis]] is dryness and itching on the upper eyelids. This condition is often seeing in young people and can lead to reddish dry eye and scaly eyebrows. To relieve the itching sensation, one may need to apply warm compresses and use topical [[corticosteroid]] creams.

=== Skin ===
[[File:Eczema-arms.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Eczema]] arms]]
[[Eczema]] is another cause of chronic irritation and affects millions of individuals. Eczema simply means a dry skin which is itchy. The condition usually starts at an early age and continues throughout life. The major complaint of people who suffer from eczema is an itchy dry skin. Sometimes, the itching will be associated with a skin [[rash]]. The affected areas are always dry, scaly, reddish and may ooze sometimes. Eczema cannot be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. One should use moisturizers, use cold compresses and avoid frequent hot showers. There are over the counter corticosteroids creams which can be applied. Sometimes, an anti [[histamine]] has to be used to prevent the chronic itching sensations. There are also many individuals who have allergies to a whole host of substances like nuts, hair, [[dander]], plants and fabrics. For these individuals, even the minimal exposure can lead to a full blown skin rash, itching, wheezing and coughing. Unfortunately, other than avoidance, there is no other cure. There are allergy shots which can help desensitize against an [[allergen]] but often the results are poor and the treatments are expensive. Most of these individuals with chronic irritation from allergens usually need to take anti histamines or use a [[bronchodilator]] to relieve symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://health.lifestyle.yahoo.ca/condition_info_details.asp?disease_id=157 Eczema Condition Factsheets] Yahoo Health. Retrieved on 2010-01-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common irritation disorder in females is [[intertrigo]]. This disorder is associated with chronic irritation under folds of skin. This is typically seen under large breasts, groins and folds of the abdomen in obese individuals. Candida quickly grows in warm moist areas of these folds and presents as a chronic itch. Over time, the skin becomes red and often oozes.
[[Perspiration]] is also a chronic type of irritation which can be very annoying. Besides being socially unacceptable, sweat stain the clothes and can present with a foul odor. In some individuals, the warm moist areas often become easily infected. The best way to treat excess sweating is good hygiene, frequent change of clothes and use of deodorants/antiperspirants.

=== Vaginal irritation ===
[[File:Herpes(PHIL 1573 lores).jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Herpes simplex]] lesion of lower lip, second day after onset]]
One of the most common areas of the body associated with irritation is the [[vagina]]. Many women complain of an itch, dryness, or discharge in the [[perineum]] at some point in their lives. There are several causes of vaginal irritation including fungal [[vaginitis]] (like candida) or [[trichomoniasis]]. Often, [[herpes simplex]] infection of the mouth or genitalia can be recurrent and prove to be extremely irritating.
Sometimes, the irritation can be of the chronic type and it can be so intense that it also causes painful intercourse. Aside from infections, chronic irritation of the vagina may be related to the use of contraceptives and condoms made from latex. The majority of contraceptives are made of synthetic chemicals which can induce allergies, rash and itching. Sometimes the lubricant used for intercourse may cause irritation.
Another cause of irritation in women is post menopausal vaginitis. The decline in the female sex hormones leads to development of dryness and itching in the vagina. This is often accompanied by painful [[sexual intercourse]]. Cracks and tears often develop on outer aspects of the labia which becomes red from chronic scratching. Post menopausal vaginitis can be treated with short term use of vaginal [[estrogen]] [[pessary]] and use of a [[moisturizer]].

=== Lungs ===
[[File:Tobacco diagram.png|thumb|right|180px|How [[tobacco]] affects your body]]
Individuals who smoke or are exposed to smog or other airborne pollutants can develop a condition known as [[COPD]]. In this disorder, there is constant irritation of the [[Vertebrate trachea|breathing tubes]] (trachea) and the small airways. The constant irritation results in excess production of mucus which makes breathing difficult. Frequently, these individuals wake up in the morning with copious amounts of foul smelling [[mucus]] and a cough which lasts all day. [[Wheeze]] and heavy [[phlegm]] are common findings. COPD is a lifelong disorder and there is no cure. Eventually most people develop recurrent [[pneumonia]], lack any type of endurance, and are unable to work productively. One of the ways to avoid chronic bronchitis is to stop or not smoke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/articles/280.html What is chronic bronchitis] Family Doctor. Retrieved on 2010-01-12&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stomach ===

[[Gastritis]] or stomach upset is a common irritating disorder affecting millions of people. Gastritis is basically inflammation of the stomach wall lining and has many causes. Smoking, excess alcohol consumption and the use of [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs), such as [[ibuprofen]], account for the majority of causes of gastritis. In some cases, gastritis may develop after surgery, a major burn, infection or emotional stress. The most common symptoms of gastritis include sharp abdominal pain which may radiate to the back. This may be associated with [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], abdominal [[bloating]] and a lack of appetite. When the condition is severe it may even result in loss of blood on the stools. The condition often comes and goes for years because most people continue to drink alcohol or use [[NSAIDs]]. Treatment includes the use of antacids or acid neutralizing drugs, antibiotics, and avoiding spicy food and alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/gastritis/DS00488 gastritis Information] Mayo Clinic.

'''Jaime Ramón Lusinchi''' (27 May 1924 – 21 May 2014) was a Venezuelan politician who was the [[President of Venezuela]] from 1984 to 1989.  His term was characterized by an economic crisis, growth of the external debt, populist policies, currency depreciation, inflation and corruption that exacerbated the crisis of the political system established in 1958.

Although accused of corruption after leaving office, Lusinchi was popular during his presidency, and was succeeded by a member of his own political party, [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]].

==Background==
Jaime Lusinchi was born in [[Clarines]], [[Anzoategui]], on 27 May 1924. His mother María Angelica Lusinchi, who was of Italian-Corsican descent, gave him her family name.  Growing up without the presence of a father (who probably was an Italian immigrant),{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Lusinchi attended elementary school in his native Clarines and [[Puerto Píritu]], and high school at the Federal School of [[Barcelona, Anzoátegui]]. In 1941 he began to study Medicine at the [[University of the Andes, Venezuela|University of the Andes]] in [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]], but soon moved to [[Caracas]] continuing his career at the [[Central University of Venezuela]] graduating in 1947. He married Gladys Castillo in 1941.

==Political career==
In 1937, at the age of 13, Lusinchi vinculated to the National Democratic Party, organization created by [[Rómulo Betancourt]] against the government of [[Eleazar López Contreras]]. In 1941, Lusinchi was present at the foundation of the social democratic party [[Acción Democrática]].

During his time at college, Lusinchi stood out as a political activist, was secretary of the School Medicine Council, vice president of the Venezuelan Association of Youth and vice president of the Student Federation of Venezuela - an organization with Marxist influences that became part of the "19 October 1945" revolutionary movement which overthrew the government of [[Isaías Medina Angarita]]. In 1948, he was elected president of the Municipal Council of Freites District and president of the Legislative Assembly of Anzoátegui, as well as regional secretary of Acción Democrática.

After the overthrow of Venezuela's first democratically elected leader, [[Rómulo Gallegos]], by a military-led coup on 24 November 1948, Lusinchi continued carrying out political activities whilst in hiding from the new military-dominated authorities. For a time he worked in a hospital belonging to the oil company Mene Grande in San Tomé (Anzoátegui state), however he soon moved to Caracas to avoid persecution by security forces who had already arrested him several times before.

In Caracas he was part of the clandestine organization of Acción Democrática which, in coordination with the leadership in exile, established an organised resistance to the military dictatorship. Lusinchi acquired responsibilities in the national secretariats of organization and propaganda, and was a member of the party's Political Bureau. In 1950 he was one of the organizers of the nationwide strike of oil workers. After the 1952 election fraud, which dissolved the Civilian-Military Junta and began the dictatorship of [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]], Lusinchi was again captured and imprisoned at the National Security facility.

A month later he was transferred to the ''Cárcel Modelo'' (Model Prison) in Caracas, and was released shortly after that, beginning an exile of five years in [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and the United States. During his stay in [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Santiago de Chile]], he undertook postgraduate study in Pediatrics. He resided in Santiago from 1953 and worked at Roberto del Río Hospital. In addition, he struck up friendships with prominent figures in local politics, such as the Christian Democrat [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] and the democratic-socialist leader [[Salvador Allende]].

In 1956 he moved to [[New York City]], which was the focal point of Acción Democrática's leadership in exile, with Betancourt as the principal leader. In the aforementioned metropolis Lusinchi obtained a master's degree in pediatrics, at [[Lincoln Hospital (Bronx, New York)|Lincoln Hospital]] and the [[Bellevue Hospital Center]], joining the American Academy of Pediatrics. On 23 January 1958, democracy was restored in Venezuela. Therein after the fall of the Pérez Jiménez Government, Lusinchi returned from exile, and joined the National Executive Committee of Acción Democrática as secretary for International Affairs. In the 1959 General Elections he was elected deputy for Anzoátegui for the National Congress, being re-elected in 1963, 1968 and 1973.

In 1977, Lusinchi unsuccessfully ran for the presidency of Acción Democrática and in the 1978 elections was defeated by [[Luis Piñerúa Ordaz]] (who in turn lost against the candidate of [[COPEI]], [[Luis Herrera Campins]]). After this, Lusinchi was elected senator for the 1979-1984 period. On March, 1981 he was elected General Secretary of Acción Democrática, and on 29 June 1982, he was nominated as a candidate for the 1983 elections.

On 4 December 1983, Lusinchi with 56% of the votes, won the presidency, and Acción Democrática obtained an absolute majority n the Congress. On 2 February 1984, he was sworn in as President of Venezuela for a five-year term.&lt;ref name="AB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_del_sur/venezuela/jaime_lusinchi#1|title=CIDOB - CIDOB|website=CIDOB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency==

{{Main|Presidency of Jaime Lusinchi}}
Lusinchi started his presidency at the age of 59, promising to govern with fairness, transparency, social sensitivity and austerity in the use of public funds, while presenting himself as a moderate president.

The first three years of his presidency were characterized by efforts to achieve economy stability, the paying off of the foreign debts, the reduction of public spending, the implementation of social programs benefiting the people and the promotion of industrial growth. These goals were not accomplished. However, agriculture and the iron mining industry were developed during his administration, the country achieved positive growth rates at the end of 1984, with a growth rate of 6% in GDP, but the official rate of unemployment inherited from the previous government of [[Luis Herrera Campins]] was 20%.

During this period, the government started negotiations to restructure interest payments and amortizations of the foreign debt, which in 1985 was 36 billion dollars (of which 28 billion was from the public sector), contracted with the international private banking and multilateral agencies. The first positive result of this effort was that Venezuela regained a credit-eligibility rating. In addition, Lusinchi took initiatives to increase oil prices via [[OPEC]].

However, Lusinchi was not successful at crucial goals for the development of the country. The oil market was too unstable due to price fluctuations and thus unpredictable, the oil prices were low, and the Venezuelan economy was too oil-dependent. This led to a dismal situation due to an excessively high government fiscal budget, depleting financial reserves for the payment of debt, an important pledge made during Lusinchi's presidential campaign.

1985, was characterized by a relative social peace and the absence of labor disputes and strikes, in part due to the support of the government by the largest trade union of the country, the [[Confederation of Workers of Venezuela]], which had traditionally been closely linked to Acción Democrática. During this year, Lusinchi welcomed [[John Paul II]], the first Pope ever to visit Venezuela. But in the second half of his presidency, the social malaise grew, and the government was pressed to change the direction of its policies. In December 1986, the government decided to devalue the official exchange of the national currency [[Venezuelan bolívar|bolivar]] by 93%, culminating with three years of depreciation of the national currency.  Starting February, 1983, also introduced was a system of multiple currency changes. In 1987, Lusinchi finally stopped the economic program carried out from the beginning of his term in office, and gave up his attempts to pay off the external debt, control the fiscal deficit and restrain public spending.

After that, Lusinchi decreed salary increases, price controls, emission of currency and compensatory bonds for subsidies. These measures tried to appease social tensions, that from 1987 on had appeared with more intensity. Among the consequences of this economic program were, more inflation and budget deficits.

The return to economic populism as in previous administrations safeguarded Lusinchi's popularity. However, there occurred currency devaluation, corruption, media criticism and unsatisfactory results from the Presidential [[Comisión para la Reforma del Estado|Commission for State Reform]] (COPRE) which was established on 17 December 1984 and whose work encountered the same bureaucratic problems and administrative inefficiency, which it attempted to solve.

During Lusinchi's presidency some repudable incidents also occurred, such as the [[Yumare massacre]], in [[Yaracuy (state)|Yaracuy]], on 8 May 1986 carried out by the [[DISIP]] (political police of Venezuela), executing nine members of the subversive group ''Punto Cero''; and the [[massacre of El Amparo]], in [[Apure State]], on 29 October 1988, in which 14 fishermen were mistakenly assumed to be [[guerrilla]]s and killed by the army.

Lusinchi supported the former minister and political leader [[Octavio Lepage]] in his bid to be AD's candidate for the 1988 elections, but Lepage was defeated in the internal elections of the party on October, 1987, by the former president [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]]. Pérez was elected for a new term after a gap as president in 1988. Lusinchi finished his term in office on 2 February 1989.&lt;ref name="CD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_del_sur/venezuela/jaime_lusinchi#2|title=CIDOB - CIDOB|website=CIDOB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Paul II visits Venezuela===
In January 1986, Pope [[John Paul II]] visited Venezuela. This was to be the first time ever that a Roman pontiff had visited that country specifically. As part of that very special event, thousands of people were mobilized to conduct many cultural and religious programs in several different cities, notably [[Puerto Ordaz]], [[Maracaibo]], [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]] and [[Caracas]]. To commemorate the place where the Pope conducted Mass while in Caracas, a housing complex was created years later that used the Pope's official title, [[John Paul II]], as its own. Unfortunately that effort became tarnished by corruption and scandal.&lt;ref name="EF"&gt;[http://www.fpolar.org.ve/Encarte/fasciculo25/fasc2505.html John Paul II visits Venezuela] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117094004/http://www.fpolar.org.ve/Encarte/fasciculo25/fasc2505.html |date=17 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caldas incident===
{{Main|Colombia-Venezuela relations}}
On 13 August 1987, the Colombian navy corvette ''Caldas'' sailed into the [[Gulf of Venezuela]], causing a crisis in Colombian-Venezuelan relations that almost led to armed conflict. The crisis was eventually resolved by dialogue between Lusinchi and Colombian President [[Virgilio Barco]].&lt;ref name="GH"&gt;[http://www.fpolar.org.ve/Encarte/fasciculo25/fasc2503.html Caldas incident] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124091433/http://www.fpolar.org.ve/encarte/fasciculo25/fasc2503.html |date=24 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later career ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lusinchi poster.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Poster of Jaime Lusinchi, as candidate for the 1983 presidential elections]] --&gt;
After his presidency had ended, Lusinchi was appointed Senator for Life, as was permitted by the Venezuelan constitution of 1961. But From 27 March 1990, Lusinchi became the subject of a parliamentary inquiry looking at what was believed to be a corruption scandal of huge proportions that took place during his term in government. Accused of illegally influencing decisions at the currency exchange through the financial Regime of Preferential Currency Change (RECADI) and management of funds at the Foreign Affairs Ministry, as well as the purchase of 65 off-road vehicles that were to be used in the 1988 electoral campaign of Acción Democrática; the diversion of other funds from the National Institute for Racetracks (INH). He was also declared a suspect in the August 1993 sending of mail bombs meant to intimidate members of the Supreme Court.

In November 1991, the Venezuelan Congress issued a "political and moral condemnation" to be lodged against the former president for his part in economic mismanagement and administrative irregularities that took place during his term. Then, on 10 August 1993, the Supreme Court decided it had found evidence of actual criminality during its review of charges filed against Lusinchi by the Attorney General's Office, and started proceedings against him.

On 13 August Lusinchi was stripped of senatorial immunity, and prohibited from leaving of country. Lusinchi responded by flying to [[Miami]]. Next he left for [[Costa Rica]] where he met Blanca Ibáñez, his future wife. In July 1994, and again in February 1997, charges were filed against him by the courts. A trial was opened against the former president, ostensibly for his illegal use of funds belonging to the Department of Foreign Affairs and the National Institute for Racetracks (INH). But in October 1999, the Supreme Court reversed both decisions.

Although an inquiry into the process of how that happened was later opened, by then the corruption charges against him had expired their legal term of placement. Again in June 2006 however, himself and seven former officials of his government, along with 38 other retired members of the Venezuelan security services [[DISIP]] were accused of in some way being guilty of events now known as the Yumare Massacre.

Lusinchi left Venezuela via Miami and lived in the city of San José, Costa Rica.&lt;ref name="KL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_del_sur/venezuela/jaime_lusinchi#3|title=CIDOB - CIDOB|website=CIDOB}}&lt;/ref&gt; till 2009, when returned to Caracas.

==Personal life and death==
Lusinchi was married to Gladys Castillo in 1941–1988 (they had 1 son and 4 daughters) who served as [[List of First Ladies of Venezuela|First Lady of Venezuela]] from 1984, and then to Blanca Ibáñez in 1991–2014.

Lusinchi died on 21 May 2014 at the age of 89 after having been hospitalized for lung problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.co/internacional/latinoamerica/venezuela/muere-ex-presidente-venezolano-jaime-lusinchi-a-los-89-anos,b1dc00e3abf16410VgnCLD2000000ec6eb0aRCRD.html|title=Movistar Store|website=noticias.terra.com.co}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://noticiaaldia.com/2014/05/ex-presidente-jaime-lusinchi-esta-en-terapia-intensiva/&lt;/ref&gt; He died about 5 weeks before ex-President [[Ramón José Velásquez]] died on 24 June 2014 of a [[natural causes]].

'''Kathryn Elizabeth Doty''' (née '''Hohn'''; July 15, 1920 – October 14, 2016), also known by her stage name '''Kathryn Adams''' or as '''Kathryn Adams Doty''', was an American [[actor|actress]].

== Early years ==
The daughter of a [[Methodism|Methodist]] minister, Dr. Chris G. Hohn,&lt;ref name="scc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Warrenton Girl in Movies|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7233957/st_clair_chronicle/|work=St. Clair Chronicle|date=November 23, 1939|location=Missouri, St. Clair|page=1|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = October 29, 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doty was born in [[New Ulm, Minnesota]]. When she was 6,&lt;ref name=slt/&gt; the family moved to [[Warrenton, Missouri]],&lt;ref name=scc/&gt; where her father was chaplain and executive secretary at an orphan's home.&lt;ref name=slt/&gt; After she developed lung problems, she spent two years at a camp in Minnesota. As early as age 13, she took her father's place in the pulpit when he was sick. In a 1939 newspaper article, she recalled: "It was quite a radical thing, in that small town, for a little girl to conduct the church services and preach the sermon, but the congregation understood and were very kind to me."&lt;ref name=slt/&gt;

Doty was a student at [[Hamline University]] in Saint Paul, Minnesota, (where she sang in the a cappella choir)&lt;ref name=slt/&gt; and worked as a catalog clerk at the headquarters of [[Montgomery Ward#Original Montgomery Ward (1872–2001)|Montgomery Ward]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Othman|first1=Frederick C.|title=Hollywood Day By Day|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7234273/the_danville_morning_news/|work=The Danville Morning News|agency=United Press|date=April 15, 1940|location=Pennsylvania, Danville|page=2|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = October 29, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; when an opportunity for an acting career arose. She competed in 1939 in the national finals of the [[Jesse L. Lasky]] radio contest, ''[[Gateway to Hollywood]]'', received a contract,&lt;ref name=slt/&gt; and remained in California to begin a film career under the name of Kathryn Adams.

== Film ==
Doty debuted on film in ''[[5th Avenue Girl]]'' (1939).&lt;ref name="slt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=W.K.|title=Prepared for Screen Stardom in the Pulpit!|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7233578/the_salt_lake_tribune/|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=September 17, 1939|location=Utah, Salt Lake City|page=77|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = October 29, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her most notable roles was as "Mrs. Brown", the young mother in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942).&lt;ref name="Doty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westernclippings.com/interview/kathrynadams_interview.shtml |title=Kathryn Adams Interview |publisher=Western Clippings |first=Mike |last=Fitzgerald |accessdate=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She co-starred in ''[[Sky Raiders]]'' (1941), a [[Serial film|film serial]] from [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and had the leading lady role in three [[Western (genre)|Western]] films in which [[Johnny Mack Brown]] starred.&lt;ref name=lw/&gt;

==Personal life==
She married fellow actor [[Hugh Beaumont (actor)|Hugh Beaumont]] in an [[Easter]] wedding, April 13, 1941, at [[Hollywood]] Congregational Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News Briefs|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7234107/the_daily_reporter/|work=The Daily Reporter|agency=International News Service|date=April 14, 1941|location=Indiana, Greenfield|page=4|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = October 29, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had three children: Hunter, Kristy, and Mark. After divorcing Beaumont in 1974, she married Fred Doty, and relocated to her native Minnesota. Fred Doty (1922 – 2011) died on January 8, 2011, aged 88.

She earned a master's degree in Educational Psychology and had a career as a psychologist, working at the Footlight's Child Guidance Clinic at [[Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center]] and later in Minnesota after she moved back to her home state.&lt;ref name=lw/&gt;

== Writing ==
Adams Doty wrote two novels: ''A Long Year of Silence'' and ''Wild Orphan''. ''A Long Year of Silence'', set in [[New Ulm, Minnesota]], during World War I, was a finalist for the Minnesota Book Award and winner of the 2005 Midwest Book Award. A third book, ''Becoming the Mother of Me'', described her life growing up as a minister's daughter and her trip to Hollywood and her first marriage.

Writing as '''Kathryn Doty''', she published short stories in ''Pocket'', ''The Friend'' and various children's magazines.&lt;ref name="lw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=Michael G.|last2=Magers|first2=Boyd|title=Ladies of the Western: Interviews with Fifty-One More Actresses from the Silent Era to the Television Westerns of the 1950s and 1960s|date=2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786426560|pages=9–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vs1ECjGcuVEC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Kathryn+Adams%22+actress&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlzcKavIHQAhVF5iYKHdxZAYAQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kathryn%20Adams%22%20actress&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13170">The '''law of comparative judgment''' was conceived by [[L. L. Thurstone]]. In modern-day terminology, it is more aptly described as a model that is used to obtain measurements from any process of [[pairwise comparison]]. Examples of such processes are the comparison of perceived intensity of physical [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], such as the weights of objects, and comparisons of the extremity of an attitude expressed within statements, such as statements about capital punishment. The measurements represent how we perceive objects, rather than being measurements of actual physical properties. This kind of measurement is the focus of [[psychometrics]] and [[psychophysics]].

In somewhat more technical terms, the law of comparative judgment is a mathematical representation of a '''discriminal process''', which is any process in which a comparison is made between pairs of a collection of entities with respect to magnitudes of an attribute, trait, [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]], and so on. The theoretical basis for the model is closely related to [[item response theory]] and the theory underlying the [[Rasch model]], which are used in psychology and education to analyse data from questionnaires and tests.

==Background==

Thurstone published a paper on the law of comparative judgment in 1927. In this paper he introduced the underlying concept of a [[psychological]] [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] for a particular 'project in [[measurement]]' involving the comparison between a series of stimuli, such as [[Body weight|weight]]s and handwriting specimens, in pairs. He soon extended the domain of application of the law of comparative judgment to things that have no obvious physical counterpart, such as attitudes and values (Thurstone, 1929). For example, in one experiment, people compared statements about capital punishment to judge which of each pair expressed a stronger positive (or negative) attitude.

The essential idea behind Thurstone's process and model is that it can be used to scale a collection of stimuli based on simple comparisons between stimuli two at a time: that is, based on a series of [[pairwise comparison|''pairwise'' comparisons]]. For example, suppose that someone wishes to measure the perceived weights of a series of five objects of varying masses. By having people compare the weights of the objects in pairs, data can be obtained and the law of comparative judgment applied to estimate scale values of the ''perceived'' weights. This is the perceptual counterpart to the physical weight of the objects. That is, the scale represents how heavy people perceive the objects to be based on the comparisons.

Although Thurstone referred to it as a law, as stated above, in terms of modern [[psychometric]] theory the 'law' of comparative judgment is more aptly described as a measurement [[model (abstract)|model]].  It represents a general theoretical model which, applied in a particular empirical context, constitutes a scientific hypothesis regarding the outcomes of comparisons between some collection of objects. If data agree with the model, it is possible to produce a scale from the data.

===Relationships to pre-existing psychophysical theory===

Thurstone showed that in terms of his conceptual framework, Weber's law and the so-called [[Weber-Fechner law]], which are sometimes (and misleadingly) regarded as one and the same, are independent, in the sense that one may be applicable but not the other to a given collection of experimental data.  In particular, Thurstone showed that if Fechner's law applies ''and'' the discriminal dispersions associated with stimuli are constant (as in Case 5 of the LCJ outlined below), then Weber's law will also be verified. He considered that the Weber-Fechner law and the LCJ both involve a linear measurement on a psychological continuum whereas Weber's law does not.

Weber's law essentially states that how much people perceive physical stimulus intensity to change depends on that intensity. For example, if someone compares a light object of 1&amp;nbsp;kg with one slightly heavier, one notices a relatively small difference, perhaps when the second object is 1.2&amp;nbsp;kg. On the other hand, if someone compares a heavy object of 30&amp;nbsp;kg with a second, the second must be quite a bit larger for a person to notice the difference, perhaps when the second object is 36&amp;nbsp;kg. People tend to perceive differences that are ''proportional'' to the size rather than noticing a specific difference irrespective of the size. The same applies to brightness, pressure, warmth, loudness, and so on.

Thurstone stated Weber's law as follows: "The stimulus increase which is correctly discriminated in any specified proportion of attempts (except 0 and 100 per cent) is a constant fraction of the stimulus magnitude" (Thurstone, 1959, p.&amp;nbsp;61). He considered that Weber's law said nothing directly about sensation intensities at all. In terms of Thurstone's conceptual framework, the association posited between perceived stimulus intensity and the physical magnitude of the stimulus in the Weber-Fechner law will only hold when Weber's law holds ''and'' the [[just noticeable difference]] (JND) is treated as a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of measurement.  Importantly, this is not simply given a priori (Michell, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;355), as is implied by purely mathematical derivations of the one law from the other. It is, rather, an [[empirical]] question whether measurements have been obtained; one which requires justification through the process of stating and testing a well-defined [[hypothesis]] in order to ascertain whether specific theoretical criteria for measurement have been satisfied. Some of the relevant criteria were articulated by Thurstone, in a preliminary fashion, including what he termed the ''additivity criterion''. Accordingly, from the point of view of Thurstone's approach, treating the JND as a unit is justifiable provided only that the discriminal dispersions are uniform for all stimuli considered in a given experimental context. Similar issues are associated with [[Stevens' power law]].

In addition, Thurstone employed the approach to clarify other similarities and differences between Weber's law, the Weber-Fechner law, and the LCJ.  An important clarification is that the LCJ does not ''necessarily'' involve a physical stimulus, whereas the other 'laws' do.  Another key difference is that Weber's law and the LCJ involve proportions of comparisons in which one stimulus is judged greater than another whereas the so-called Weber-Fechner law does not.

==The general form==

The most general form of the LCJ is

:&lt;math&gt;
S_i-S_j=x_{ij} \sqrt {\sigma_i^2 + \sigma_j^2- 2r_{ij}\sigma_i\sigma_j} ,
&lt;/math&gt;

in which:

*&lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; is the psychological scale value of stimuli ''i''
*&lt;math&gt;x_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the sigma corresponding with the proportion of occasions on which the magnitude of stimulus ''i'' is judged to exceed the magnitude of stimulus ''j''
*&lt;math&gt;\sigma_i&lt;/math&gt; is the discriminal dispersion of a stimulus &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;r_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the correlation between the discriminal deviations of stimuli ''i'' and ''j''

The ''discriminal dispersion'' of a stimulus ''i'' is the dispersion of fluctuations of the ''discriminal process'' for a uniform repeated stimulus, denoted &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; represents the ''mode'' of such values.  Thurstone (1959, p.&amp;nbsp;20) used the term discriminal process to refer to the "psychological values of psychophysics"; that is, the values on a psychological continuum associated with a given stimulus.

==Case 5==

Thurstone specified five particular cases of the 'law', or measurement model.  An important case of the model is Case 5, in which the discriminal dispersions are specified to be uniform and uncorrelated.  This form of the model can be represented as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
x_{ij}= \frac {S_i-S_j}{ \sigma} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;{\sigma}= \sqrt {\sigma_i^2 + \sigma_j^2}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

In this case of the model, the difference &lt;math&gt;{S_i-S_j}&lt;/math&gt; can be inferred directly from the proportion of instances in which ''j'' is judged greater than ''i'' if it is hypothesised that &lt;math&gt;x_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is distributed according to some density function, such as the normal distribution or logistic function.  In order to do so, it is necessary to let &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 1&lt;/math&gt;, which is in effect an arbitrary choice of the [[Units of measurement|unit]] of measurement.  Letting &lt;math&gt;P_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; be the proportion of occasions on which ''i'' is judged greater than ''j'', if, for example, &lt;math&gt;P_{ij}=0.84&lt;/math&gt; and it is hypothesised that &lt;math&gt;x_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is normally distributed, then it would be inferred that &lt;math&gt;S_i-S_j \cong 1&lt;/math&gt;.

When a simple logistic function is employed instead of the normal density function, then the model has the structure of the [[Bradley-Terry-Luce model]] (BTL model) (Bradley &amp; Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959). In turn, the [[Rasch model]] for dichotomous data (Rasch, 1960/1980) is identical to the BTL model after the person [[parameter]] of the Rasch model has been eliminated, as is achieved through statistical conditioning during the process of Conditional [[Maximum Likelihood]] estimation. With this in mind, the specification of uniform discriminal dispersions is equivalent to the requirement of parallel Item Characteristic Curves (ICCs) in the Rasch model. Accordingly, as shown by Andrich (1978), the Rasch model should, in principle, yield essentially the same results as those obtained from a [[Thurstone scale]]. Like the Rasch model, when applied in a given empirical context, Case 5 of the LCJ constitutes a mathematized hypothesis which embodies theoretical criteria for measurement.

==Applications==
One important application involving the law of comparative judgment is the widely used [[Analytic Hierarchy Process]], a structured technique for helping people deal with complex decisions. It uses [[pairwise comparisons]] of tangible and intangible factors to construct ratio scales that are useful in making important decisions.&lt;ref name='DMFL'&gt;{{cite book | last = Saaty | first = Thomas L. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Decision Making for Leaders: The Analytic Hierarchy Process for Decisions in a Complex World | publisher = RWS Publications | date = 1999-05-01 | location = Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania | pages = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-9620317-8-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='RACSAM'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Relative Measurement and its Generalization in Decision Making: Why Pairwise Comparisons are Central in Mathematics for the Measurement of Intangible Factors - The Analytic Hierarchy/Network Process|journal=[[Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences|Review of the Royal Academy of Exact, Physical and Natural Sciences, Series A: Mathematics (RACSAM)]]|date=September 2008|first=Thomas L.|last=Saaty|authorlink=Thomas L.

[[File:Chinese meridians.JPG|thumb|right|300px|System of main meridians with acupuncture point locations]]
This article provides a comprehensive list of [[acupuncture point]]s, locations on the body used in [[acupuncture]], [[acupressure]], and other treatment systems based on [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)]].

== Locations and basis ==

{{main|Meridian (Chinese medicine)}}

More than four hundred acupuncture points have been described, with the majority located on one of the main [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]], pathways which run throughout the body and according to [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)]] transport life energy ([[qi]], 氣).  TCM recognizes twenty meridians, cutaneous and subcutaneous in nature, which have branching sub-meridians believed to affect surrounding tissues. Twelve of these major meridians, commonly referred to as "the primary meridians", are bilateral and are associated with internal organs. The remaining eight meridians are designated as "extraordinary", and are also bilateral except for three, one that encircles the body near the waist, and two that run along the midline of the body. Only those two extraordinary meridians that run along the midline contain their own points, the remaining six comprise points from the aforementioned twelve primary meridians. There are also points that are not located on the fourteen major meridians but do lie in the complete nexus referred to as ''jing luo'' (經絡). Such outliers are often referred to as "extra points".&lt;ref name=Deadman2007&gt;Deadman, P, Baker K, Al-Khafaji, M. 2007. A Manual of Acupuncture, 2nd Edition. Journal of Chinese Medicine Publications. {{ISBN|978-0951054659}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many hypotheses have been proposed, the anatomical and physiological basis for acupuncture points and meridians remains elusive.&lt;ref name=Napadow2008&gt;Napadow V, Ahn A, Longhurst J, et al. 2008. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3155097/ The status and future of acupuncture mechanism research.]  J Altern Complement Med 14(7): 861–869.&lt;/ref&gt; Hypotheses include neural signaling, with possible involvement of opioid peptides, glutamate, and adenosine, and correspondence to responsive parts in the central nervous system; or mechanical signaling, with involvement of connective tissue (fascia), and mechanical wave activation of the calcium ion channel to beta-endorphin secretion.&lt;ref name=Yang2011&gt;Yang ES, Li P, Nilius B, Li G. 2011.

Pflügers Archiv: European Journal of Physiology.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, acupuncture points are located by a combination of anatomical landmarks, palpation, and feedback from the patient.&lt;ref name=Deadman2007/&gt;

== Nomenclature ==

In east Asian countries practitioners commonly refer to acupuncture points by their traditional names.  Some points have several names.  When acupuncture was adopted in the western world, a standard nomenclature was developed to unambiguously identify the acupuncture points on meridians.  This model achieved wide acceptance and today virtually every book on acupuncture refers to acupuncture points using it.  The [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]] published ''A Proposed Standard International Acupuncture Nomenclature Report'' in 1991, listing 361 classical acupuncture points organized according to the fourteen meridians, eight extra meridians, 48 extra points, and scalp acupuncture points,&lt;ref&gt;Regional Office for the Western Pacific, WHO. 1991. [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/1991/9241544171_eng.pdf A Proposed Standard International Acupuncture Nomenclature Report of a WHO Scientific Group] (pdf). [[World Health Organization]]. Retrieved Sep-05-2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and published ''Standard Acupuncture Nomenclature'' in 1993, focused on the 361 classical acupuncture points.&lt;ref&gt;Regional Office for the Western Pacific, WHO. 1993. [http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/s7143e/s7143e.pdf Standard Acupuncture Nomenclature, 2nd ed] (pdf). [[World Health Organization]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110228201809/http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/8DDB198B-B00B-47AB-9BA1-9337CF49C5A5/0/Standard_Acupuncture_Nomenclature_2nd_ed.pdf Archived from the original on 28 February 2011]. Retrieved Sep-05-2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each acupuncture point is identified by the meridian on which it is located and its number in the point sequence on that channel.  For example, ''Lu-9'' identifies the 9th acupuncture point on the lung meridian, ''tài yuān'' (太渊) or ''gui xin'' (鬼心), two names used for this same point. The only glitch with this unique systemized method can be found on the urinary bladder meridian, where the outer line of 14 points found on the back near the spine are inserted in one of two ways; following the last point of the inner line along the spine (會陽) and resuming with the point found in the crease of the buttocks (承扶), or following the point in the center of the crease of the knee (委中) and resuming with the point just below that (合陽), found in the bifurcation of the gastrocnemius muscle.  Although classification of the extra points often tries to utilize a similar shortcut method, where a numbered sequence along an assigned body part is used, there is no commonly agreed-upon system and therefore universal identification of these points relies on the original naming system of traditional Chinese characters.

The above figure and the tables below follow the standard numbering scheme to identify the acupuncture points of the main channels.  For extra points the tables follow the numbering scheme found in ''A Manual of Acupuncture''.&lt;ref name=Deadman2007/&gt;

'''Medical Marijuana, Inc.''' ([[Over-the-counter (finance)|traded over the counter]] as MJNA), is a [[holding company]] with subsidiaries that make and sell a range of hemp-based products.

==History==
The company came into being in 2009, when a company called Club Vivanet bought another company from Bruce Perlowin; the new company was named Medical Marijuana, Inc. and was based in [[Poway, California]].&lt;ref name=SDUT2015&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harvey|first1=Katherine P. |title=Poway's cannabis conglomerate |url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-poway-cannabis-conglomerate-medical-marijuana-inc-2015apr12-story.html |work=San Diego Union Tribune |date=April 12, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221060032/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-poway-cannabis-conglomerate-medical-marijuana-inc-2015apr12-story.html | dead-url = no |archivedate=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company appears to have been among the first to exploit the 2004 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision, [[Hemp Industries Association#HIA vs. DEA|HIA vs DEA]], which prevented the federal government from treating hemp as though it were marijuana, to market canabidiol-based products to the public.&lt;ref name=SDUT2015/&gt;

Michael Llamas was the initial CEO of MMI; he stepped down in 2012 when he was indicted for his role in a real estate [[Ponzi scheme]].&lt;ref name=SDUT2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes2014&gt;

The company operated at a loss for 2011 and 2012, and made money for the first time in 2013 on the basis of a single contract signed by one of its subsidiaries.&lt;ref name=SDUT2015/&gt; In 2013, MMI and [[CannaVEST]], an [[exchange-traded fund]], each invested in a company called Kannalife Sciences Inc.&lt;ref name=GEN2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/kannalife-in-r-amp-d-collaboration-for-cannabinoid-based-drugs/81248179/ |title=Kannalife in R&amp;D Collaboration for Cannabinoid-Based Drugs |publisher=Genetic Engineering News |date=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Kannalife had been founded in 2010 by Dean Petkanas, former CFO of [[Stratton Oakmont]], the penny-stock trading company depicted in ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'', and [[Thoma Kikis]].&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/nyregion/a-competition-to-get-a-medical-marijuana-license-in-new-york.html?_r=0|title=For Pot Inc., the Rush to Cash In Is Underway|last=Leland|first=John|date=October 31, 2014|work=The New York Times|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2016/07/12/cannabis-cte-treatment-kannalife |title=How cannabis is helping one company research treatment of CTE |date=July 12, 2016|work=Sports Illustrated|last=Baskin|first=Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/article/the-nfls-anti-weed-policy-even-extends-to-drugs-that-could-prevent-brain-damage. |title=The NFL's Anti-Weed Policy Even Extends to Drugs That Could Prevent Brain Damage |last=Guion |first=Payton |date=November 12, 2014 |work=VICE News |accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kannalife was founded to commercialize inventions made at the [[NIH]] concerning methods to use [[cannabidiol]] as a [[neuroprotectant]].&lt;ref name=GEN2013/&gt;   As of 2016, Kannalife was working on novel analogs of CBD that are more drug-like than CBD.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

In the fall of 2014, the company filed a [[lawsuit]] against Project CBD and Stewart Environmental Labs to dispute a report of "significant levels of toxic solvents" in the hemp oil offered by one of their subsidiaries.  Stewart Environmental settled with the company but Project CBD filed an anti-SLAPP motion in May 2015.&lt;ref name="HempNews"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharp|first1=Richard|title=Project CBD Seeks to Strike Down $100 Million Lawsuit|url=http://www.thehempnews.com/project-cbd-seeks-to-strike-down-100-million-lawsuit/|publisher=The Hemp News|date=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, MMI reported that it was under investigation by the SEC; the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] warned investors that year about penny stock scams in the marijuana industry.&lt;ref name=Forbes2014/&gt; In 2015 a report in ''Forbes'' laid out relationships among CannaVEST, money taken in by the real estate Ponzi scheme run by Llamas, Stuart Titus and the [[private equity]] firm General Hemp that he ran, and one of MMI's subsidiaries called PhytoSphere.&lt;ref name=Forbes2014/&gt;

In 2015 the company hired Titus as CEO after having an interim CEO since Llamas' departure.&lt;ref name=SDUT2015/&gt;  At that time, the company did most of its business through a subsidiary called HempMedsPX, which marketed and sold products from other MMI subsidiaries.&lt;ref name=SDUT2015/&gt;  As of 2015 the company sourced the [[hemp oil]] used in its products from a facility in Denmark.&lt;ref name=SDUT2015/&gt;   Its then-most prominent product was called "Real Scientific Hemp Oil", sold at around $169 per 3 grams, and was marketed as a [[dietary supplement]]. It also sold a range of other consumer products, such as hemp-based shampoo.&lt;ref name=SDUT2015/&gt;

The '''Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003''', which came into effect on 5 October 2005, is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] which enables medical professionals to detain and treat people against their will on grounds of [[mental disorder]], with the [[Mental Health Tribunal for Scotland]] and the [[Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland]] providing safeguards against mistreatment.

It largely replaces the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984.

== Detention certificates ==

The act provides for short term detention certificates and emergency detention certificates.

Short term certificates are referred to by the act as the 'preferred gateway' to detention, and lead, notionally, to up to 28 days' detention during which treatment may be administered against the will of the detainee, and can also lead to compulsory treatment orders, which have longer term implications for the detainee's liberty.

Detainees can apply to the Mental Health Tribunal for revocation of short term certificates.

Emergency certificates lead, notionally, to up to 72 hours' detention, and can also lead to detentions under short term certificates.

Emergency certificates do not enable treatment against the will of detainees, except for urgent treatment,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mwcscot.org.uk/the-law/mental-health-act/emergency-detention/&lt;/ref&gt; and there is no formal process of appeal against them.

Unless a certificate is completed for someone who is already in a mental health hospital, both forms of detention are preceded by detention of up to 72 hours in what are called 'places of safety', while transport to hospital is arranged.

Also, short term detentions may be extended for periods of up to three 'working days', to facilitate applications to the Mental Health Tribunal for compulsory treatment orders.

Saturdays, Sundays, and Scottish bank holidays are not counted as working days.

==Principles==
The law is based on a set of principles. These principles should be taken into account by anyone involved in a person's care and treatment.

===Past and present wishes===
Patients should be given the information and support they need to take part in decisions about their care and treatment. To help service users get their views across, the Act puts in place the right to access independent advocacy services. It also puts in place [[Advance healthcare directive|advance statements]] as a way to help service users say what care and treatment they would and would not want to have. The Mental Health Commission in Scotland examines cases where a person's advance statement has been overridden.

===The views of any carer, guardian or welfare attorney===
Carers should be involved in decision-making and should be given information they need to help them in their role. We will be developing guidance this year to help service providers and carers with the problem of [[Physician–patient privilege|patient confidentiality]] and sharing information.

===Options===
A patient's care plan should reflect their needs as an individual. A Mental Health Tribunal reviews care that looks for a compulsory treatment order that lasts longer than 2 years or the service users can request this if they wish to appeal a compulsory treatment order after 3months.

===The care and treatment that will be of most benefit===
This should be reflected in a care plan. In addition the Act puts in place safeguards when consent to treatment has not been given.

On many occasions a patient's care &amp; treatment becomes much to the opinion of any one person, with a psychiatric disorder (mentalis confusio), latest labels that of chemical imbalance or chemical disorder, perplex and confuse not only the patient, but those whom may be designated decision makers on a patient's behalf. Family members all too often are not given any information, nor the correct questions to ask.

All too often the system fails to accept a lack of science behind these labels. "where is that chemical test for this chemical imbalance?" Truth is that like the word illness: no such disease exists, nor any chemical as where is this chemical test; well paid professionals or populus of institutions together, with no clear facts and no willingness to discuss any way except that of psychiatry &amp; adding of substance of those many same category as Class substances.

===Individual abilities and background===
Important things about a person such as their age, gender, [[sexual orientation]], [[religion]], racial origin or membership of any [[ethnic group]] should be taken into account by people providing care and treatment.

People providing care should also make sure that:
# any restrictions on a person's freedom are the least necessary
# the person being treated under the act shouldn't be treated any less favourably than anyone else being treated for a mental illness, or other mental disorder
# carer's needs are taken into account
# the person being treated is getting services that are right for them
# when a person is no longer receiving compulsory treatment, he or she should still continue to get care and treatment if it is needed
# if the person being treated is under 18, his or her welfare is of the highest priority

'''Nukla''' is a fictional character published by [[Dell Comics]] in the mid-1960s.  He was created by writer [[Joe Gill]] and artist [[Sal Trapani]] (with uncredited assistance from others artists, including [[Dick Giordano]]).  The character made his debut in ''Nukla'' #1 (October-December 1965).

==Fictional character background==
Nukla is really '''Matthew Gibbs''', a handsome blond [[CIA]] [[spy]] and [[aviator|pilot]]. While flying his [[U-2 spy plane]] over [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], he is fired on by the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Red Army]]. Unable to evade the missiles, he and his aircraft are vaporised in the resulting [[nuclear explosion]].  For some unexplained reason, he is able to maintain his human consciousness in this atomized state and reform himself through sheer force of will with incredible nuclear powers.  His secret known only to his section chief Jim Clarke, Nukla used his atomic abilities to fight the enemies of the United States, like supervillains Baron Von Zee and Captain Whale.

==Powers and abilities==
Nukla has nuclear-based powers, somewhat similar to those of [[Captain Atom]].  He can will himself into an [[Invisibility|invisible]] immaterial state and in said phantom form fire destructive bolts of pure "[[radiation]]-free" atomic energy from his hands and fly at the [[speed of light]] as well as quickly heal himself of any injuries received in his mortal flesh and blood form.  He must be careful, though, not to deplete his energy and take time to recharge his "nuclear batteries" or he will not be able to transform, and extreme cold makes it impossible for him to dematerialize.

He is also able to dematerialize and rematerialize his U-2 when needed, flying it both to conserve his vast powers for when they are needed and also simply because he still enjoys being a pilot.

==Publication history==
''Nukla'' ran for only four issues.  [[Steve Ditko]], artist of [[Captain Atom]], did the artwork for the last issue. 

===Issues===
*''Nukla'' #1 (October-December 1965)
*''Nukla'' #2 (March 1966)
*''Nukla'' #3 (June 1966)
*''Nukla'' #4 (September 1966)

An '''occupational fatality''' is a death that occurs while a person is at work or performing work related tasks.  Occupational fatalities are also commonly called “occupational deaths” or “work-related deaths/fatalities” and can occur in any [[industry]] or [[employment|occupation]].

==Common causes==
Common causes of occupational fatalities include falls, machine-related incidents, motor vehicle accidents, electrocution, falling objects, [[homicide]]s and [[suicide]]s. Oftentimes, occupational fatalities can be prevented.

In the United States in 2007, 42% of occupational fatalities occurred during a transportation incident, 16% occurred after a worker came into contact with an object or equipment, 15% occurred as a result of a fall, 15% occurred as a result of [[assault]] or other [[Workplace violence|violent acts in the workplace]], 12% were the result of chemical or environmental exposures (9%) and 3% were the result of fires or explosions.&lt;ref name="bls.gov"&gt;{{cite web| title=Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries Charts 1992-2007| url=http://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfch0006.pdf| publisher=U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics| year=2009|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Selected occupations with high fatality rate.png|thumb|350px|Selected occupations with high fatality rates, 2011, in the United States.&lt;ref name=bls2006/&gt;]]
|}

==Risk factors==
Many factors contribute to a fatal incident at work. Lack of appropriate employee training and failure to provide and enforce the use of safety equipment are frequent contributors to occupational fatalities.  In some cases, employees do receive safety training, but language barriers prevent the employee from fully understanding the safety procedures. Incidents can also be the result of insufficient supervision of inexperienced employees or employees who have taken on a responsibility for which they are not properly trained. Poor worksite organization, staffing and scheduling issues, unworkable policies and practices and workplace culture can all play a role in occupational fatalities.  An incident leading to an occupational fatality is generally not the fault of a single person, but the result of a combination of many human and environmental factors.{{Cn|date=August 2017}}
==Demographics==
In distinction to "risk factors", which may be thought to imply a causal link between such factors and fatality, statistics such as those from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on the demographics of deaths at work do not imply that age and gender are in themselves causative factors of fatality, but simply show that fatalities occur more frequently among certain groups.
=== Age ===	
Although all workers are at risk for occupational fatalities, elderly workers age 65 and older are roughly three times more likely to die at work.&lt;ref&gt;“Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries Summary Report 2007.” http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.nr0.htm. Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender ===	
A large majority of occupational deaths occur among men.   In one U.S. study, 93% of deaths on the job involved men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.nr0.htm|title = Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries Summary, 2013|date = 11 September 2014|accessdate = March 2015|website = [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]|publisher = [[United States Department of Labor]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a death rate approximately 11 times higher than women.  The industries with the highest death rates are mining, agriculture, forestry, fishing, and construction, all of which employ more men than women.&lt;ref&gt;Fatal Occupational Injuries - United States, 1980-1997 MMWR Weekly, April 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Deaths of members in the military is currently above 90% men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL32492.pdf|title=American War and Military Operations Casualties: Lists and Statistics|last=DeBruyne|first=Nese|date=April 26, 2017|website=Federation Of American Scientists Logo|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==

Occupational fatalities are preventable. Prevention of occupational fatalities depends on the understanding that worker safety is not only the responsibility of the worker, but is the primary responsibility of the employer.  Employers must train all employees in the appropriate safety procedures and maintain a safe working environment so that fatalities are less likely to occur.&lt;ref&gt;"Health and Safety Act 1970 – Section 5 Duties." https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owasrch.search_form?p_doc_type=OSHACT&amp;p_toc_level=0&amp;p_keyvalue=&amp;p_status=CURRENT. Retrieved 17 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; An occupational fatality is not just the fault of the deceased worker; instead, it is the combination of unsafe work environments, insufficient safety training, and negligible employee supervision that contribute fatal incidents. As a result, it is imperative that an employer address all the potential [risk] factors at the workplace and educate all employees in safe work practices and risk awareness.

In order to perform adequate risk assessment of injuries that occur in the workplace, health and safety professionals use resources such as the [[Haddon Matrix]].  This model assesses the risks leading up to, during, and after a death in order to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. Employers and employees can learn how to identify risk factors in their work environment in order to avoid incidents that may result in death.

== Research, regulation, reporting and recommendations ==
The regulatory organization for occupational injury control and prevention is the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA).  Formed in 1970 as an agency of the [[United States Department of Labor]] under the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]], OSHA exists to prevent occupational injuries and deaths by creating and enforcing standards in the workplace.  OSHA standards address employee training programs, safety equipment, employer record keeping and proper maintenance of the work environment.  Failure to comply with the OSHA standards can result in workplace inspections and legal action including citations and fines.  In very severe cases of employer misconduct, OSHA can “red flag” an operation and send the employer to legal court.&lt;ref&gt;"Health and Safety Act 1970 – Section 17 Penalties." https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owasrch.search_form?p_doc_type=OSHACT&amp;p_toc_level=0&amp;p_keyvalue=&amp;p_status=CURRENT. Retrieved 17 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

To regulate the millions of workplaces in the United States, OSHA requires that all employers maintain a record of occupational injuries, illnesses and fatalities.  Occupational fatalities must be reported to OSHA within eight hours of the incident.  Failure to do so can result in legal action against the employer.  Employers are responsible for staying current on OSHA standards and enforcing them in their own workplace. State OSHA organizations exist in twenty-eight states and are required to have the same or more rigorous standards than the federal OSHA standards.  In these states, employers must abide by their state’s regulations. It is not the responsibility of the employee to stay current on the OSHA standards.

In addition to OSHA, the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) was formed under the Occupational Safety and Health Act as a federal research agency to formulate industry recommendations for health and safety. NIOSH is part of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) in the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS).  NIOSH analyzes workplace injury and illness data from all fifty states as well as provides support for state-based projects in occupational health and safety.

Under NIOSH, the [[Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE)]] Program tracks and investigates occupational fatalities in order to provide recommendations for prevention.  A voluntary program for individual states created in 1989, FACE is active in [[California]], [[Iowa]], [[Kentucky]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].  The primary responsibilities of the state FACE programs are to track occupational fatalities in their state, investigate select fatalities, and provide recommendations for prevention.   As part of the prevention efforts, FACE programs also produce extensive prevention education materials that are disseminated to employees, employers, [[trade union|unions]], and state organizations.

Nationally, the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI), within the U.S. Department of Labor, compiles national fatality statistics.  CFOI is the key, comprehensive system in the surveillance of occupational fatalities in the United States.

Many other non-governmental organizations also work to prevent occupational fatalities.  [[industry trade group|Trade associations]] and unions play an active role in protecting workers and disseminating prevention information.  The [[National Safety Council]] also works to prevent occupational fatalities as well as provide resources to employers and employees.

'''''Pandora''''' (1998) is a novel and a [[vampire]] in [[Anne Rice]]'s ''[[The Vampire Chronicles|Vampire Chronicles]]''. Her story is told in the book ''Pandora'', one of two novels in the ''[[New Tales of the Vampires]]'' series.

==Plot summary==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pandoranew.jpg|thumb|left|Pandora as portrayed by [[Claudia Black]] in ''[[Queen of the Damned (film)|Queen of the Damned]]'']] --&gt;
Pandora was born with the name Lydia in the Roman Republic in the year 15 BC to a Senatorial family. She is tall, with rippling brown hair and gold-brown eyes. Like many Patrician Roman females of the time Pandora was taught how to read and write and is well versed in epic poems, especially Ovid's works.  She meets [[Marius de Romanus|Marius]] for the first time when he is twenty-five and she is ten. Marius asks for Lydia's hand in marriage, but [[Pater familias|her father]] rejects Marius' offer. Five years later, Lydia sees Marius at a festival and begs her father to allow her to marry Marius. Her father again refuses.

Pandora's father holds a high rank as a Senator. But when a new emperor takes power, her family is betrayed by her own brother and killed. Only Pandora and her traitorous brother survive the massacre, and she is taken to Antioch (after changing her name) by a man who was very close to her father. There she meets Marius again, twenty years after their last encounter. Unbeknownst to her, Marius is now a vampire.

She eventually finds out what Marius has become, and also that he protects and hides the [[Those Who Must Be Kept|Queen and King of all Vampires]]. The vampire, Akabar, wants to steal the Queen's powerful and ancient blood. Marius and Pandora try to prevent him from carrying out his plan. To gain access to the Queen, Akabar uses Marius's love for Pandora against him and drains Pandora to the point of death. In order to save her, Marius is forced to make Pandora into a vampire and forced to let Akabar see the Queen, who then destroys Akabar. The pair stay together for the next two hundred years, taking care of the King and Queen of all vampires, before arguing and separating.  Marius later characterized the breakup (of which he left her and she spent six months or more waiting for him to return) as being entirely his fault:  He considers himself a teacher who longs to impart what he knows upon his pupils, but Pandora—being as free-spirited and highly educated as she was—had no patience to be his student. During their time together, against his objection, she did turn one of her beloved slaves into a vampire.  As soon as he was turned he left the pair and was not seen again.

The next time they meet again is in a [[Dresden]] ballroom in the early to late-17th century. Marius tries in vain to make Pandora leave her companion and fledgling, Arjun, and come back to him. Pandora's relationship with Arjun is of great concern to Marius, who fears Pandora is being held against her will. While she outwardly denies this, Pandora overcomes her embarrassment and admits to David in her writing that she could not bring herself to leave Arjun, citing that his stronger will propelled them both through time.

The next and last time that they meet is in 1985, when she is among thirteen vampires who survived [[Akasha (The Vampire Chronicles)|Akasha]]'s killing spree and gathered at [[Maharet]]'s house in the Sonoma compound to battle against Akasha.  Pandora remains quiet and withdrawn throughout the whole ordeal, staring out the windows and saying little, rousing herself only once to say that Akasha is trying to justify deplorable "reasons" for a holocaust.

Like many vampires, Pandora is a morose, despairing immortal who initially wanted immortality but soon regretted her choice and turns into a dark, indifferent cynic. [[Lestat de Lioncourt|Lestat]] thinks that Pandora was troubled in some deep, fundamental way even before she became a vampire, because she's the only vampire who doesn't receive visions of Maharet and [[Mekare]] in her dreams.  During the confrontation in Sonoma, when Akasha directly asks Pandora to join with her or die, Pandora merely responds in a quiet, indifferent voice that she can't do what Akasha is asking of her, and stoically accepts the idea of being killed.

Even after Akasha herself is destroyed and the thirteen vampires regroup in Armand's Night Island in [[Florida]], Pandora still acts withdrawn from her fellow vampire kin, watching music videos all day long and completely ignoring Marius, who dotes on her lovingly.  There is no sense of recovery or security in her as there is with the other vampires, and she departs from Night Island alone, still just as morose as ever.

==Other novels==
David Talbot encounters her in Paris shortly after the events of ''[[Memnoch the Devil]]'' and before the story of ''[[The Vampire Armand]]''. He asks her to write the story of her life, which she does in a cafe by writing in some notebooks he gave her. She recalls the details of her life before becoming a vampire and briefly discusses the period when she was with Marius.  After she has finished, she writes that she plans to go to [[New Orleans]] to look for Marius and to look into the eyes of Lestat, and try to understand what it is he saw. She is last seen at the end of ''[[Blood and Gold]]'', alongside Marius.

Pandora is again seen in the novel ''[[Prince Lestat]]'' when she comes to confront Arjun of his burning fledglings and old ones in Mumbai after being told by "The Voice". There she meets Gremt Stryker Knollys, who confides in her that he is also searching for "The Voice". He also claims to be the founder of the [[Talamasca Caste|Talamasca]] in the year 748, along with the vampire who created [[Marius de Romanus|Marius]] and the ghost of a vampire that was just killed named Hesketh. Gremt is the spirit Pandora meets towards the end of her novel when the writer Cassiodorus dies.

'''Peanut Corporation of America (PCA)''' was a [[peanut]]-[[Industrial process|process]]ing business with headquarters in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], plants in other southern states, and distribution across the United States, now defunct as a result of one of the most massive and lethal food-borne contamination events in U.S. history. PCA was founded in 1977 and initially run by Hugh Parnell, father of Stewart Parnell, with him and two other sons. The company was sold in 1994-1995 with the senior Parnell retiring, and with Stewart Parnell and others remaining with the new company as consultants. In 2000, control of PCA returned to Stewart Parnell via a private sale. Over this history, PCA came to operate processing facilities in [[Blakely, Georgia]], [[Suffolk, Virginia]], and [[Plainview, Texas]], providing peanut and peanut butter products primarily  to the "institutional food" market (schools, [[prisons]] and [[nursing home]]s), to food manufacturers for use in cookies, snacks, ice cream, and dog treats, and to other low-end markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/peanut-salmonella-trial-shows-food-safety-relies-on-honor-system/article_67596124-2004-11e4-bef5-0017a43b2370.html|title=Peanut salmonella trial shows food safety relies on honor system|first=Associated|last=Press|date=|website=newsadvance.com|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCA permanently halted its operations after it was found to be the source of a massive ''[[Salmonella]]'' outbreak in the U.S., during late 2008 and early 2009. By 2007, prior to closing its doors, PCA had grown to 90 employees and was doing $25&amp;nbsp;million in annual sales. It has been estimated to have been manufacturing roughly 2.5% of processed peanuts in the U.S. at that time. The 2008 contamination followed a long history of food quality issues. There had been concerns about sanitation at the company by private individuals since at least the mid-1980s, when the company was run by its founder, Stewart Parnell's father, Hugh Parnell. In addition, in the years just prior to its sale and Hugh Parnell's retirement, PCA was sued: by [[American Candy Company]] in 1990, and by Zachary Confections Inc. of [[Frankfort, Indiana]] in 1991, after discovery that PCA's peanut products exceeded the [[The Food Defect Action Levels|FDA tolerance level]] for [[aflatoxin]], a mold-derived toxin common to peanuts. Moreover, as a result of the coming contamination event, investigations would show that some PCA processing was being done without FDA knowledge and oversight, and other food handling and processing areas had gone long periods without federal inspection.

In late 2008 and early 2009, as a result of the ''Salmonella'' contamination event, 9 people died and at least 714 people (half of them children) fell ill, all from [[food poisoning]] after eating products containing contaminated peanuts. This contamination triggered the most extensive [[food recall]] in U.S. history up to that time, involving 46 states, more than 360 companies, and more than 3,900 different products manufactured using PCA ingredients. The contamination and recall had immediate major ramifications for the market of this set of farm products, and further impact on public perceptions of food safety and on government regulation of the same. On February 13, 2009, Peanut Corporation of America ceased all manufacturing and business operations, and filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7 bankruptcy]] liquidation. As of February 2009, a federal criminal investigation was continuing, and at least a dozen civil lawsuits had been filed. In September 2015, Stewart Parnell was sentenced, after earlier conviction on more than 70 criminal charges—including felony charges that included knowingly shipping tainted food across state lines—to 28 years in prison for his role in the nationwide outbreak.

In 1990 the [[FDA]] found PCA distributing peanuts with unacceptable levels of aflatoxins, caused by mold that grows in nuts and seeds.

PCA was sued in 1990 by [[American Candy Company]] after the FDA discovered that PCA's peanut butter exceeded the [[The Food Defect Action Levels|FDA tolerance level]] for [[aflatoxin]],&lt;ref name="pca"/&gt; a mold-derived toxin common to peanut production;{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} American Candy had turned the peanut butter into 8,000 unshipped cases of "kisses" for [[Wal-Mart]].&lt;ref name="pca"/&gt;{{verification needed|date=December 2015}} Another lawsuit was brought by Zachary Confections Inc. of [[Frankfort, Indiana]], in 1991, after a 40,020-pound shipment of nuts from PCA was also found to have an unacceptably high level of aflatoxin.&lt;ref name="pca"/&gt;

{{expand section | thorough coverage of reporting on oversight prior top the Salmonella event | small = no |date=December 2015}}
In 2001, FDA inspectors also found that products from the Blakely plant were potentially exposed to insecticides, according to a report obtained by the Associated Press.&lt;ref name="ap6"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jeLgwCG-FEEYH8KZ7Tt45zOdSIKgD96690U81 Insecticide found in peanut plant during 2001 tour], [[Associated Press]], February 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Virginia state inspection records, the PCA blanching operations in [[Suffolk, Virginia]], had some of the same food safety problems that would be found in the company's Georgia plant (see below).

The recall did not involve major-brand peanut butters, since PCA primarily served only low-budget and institutional providers, but many consumers reacted by avoiding peanut products altogether, driving down the sales of all brands of peanut butter by nearly 25%.&lt;ref name="n6"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/07/business/07peanut.html?hp Sales Drop 25% as Parents Shun Peanut Butter], [[New York Times]], February 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="surv"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gnaLH7aEDUDxwiBn4VbAKBSh_mXQD96APGOO2 Survey: peanut recall known but misunderstood], [[Associated Press]], February 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 investigations==

=== Georgia ===

====Journalistic====
Following initial reporting of the contamination's source, reporters and investigators began taking a careful look at the sites run by PCA. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported on February 14, 2009, the view of David Brooks, a buyer for a snack company that had visited PCA facilities in the mid-1980s (when PCA was under Hugh Parnell's control), that "everybody in the peanut industry" in the states involved (Georgia, Virginia, and Texas) knew of the serious sanitation issues associated with PCA; Brooks went on to state that PCA was "a time bomb waiting to go off."&lt;ref name="wp0215"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Lyndsey Layton |author2=Nick Miroff | title=The Rise And Fall of A Peanut Empire | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/14/AR2009021401758.html?hpid=topnews | work=The Washington Post | date=February 15, 2009 | accessdate=April 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former employees interviewed by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' stated that conditions in the plant were "filthy and nasty", and that they would never eat the peanut butter or allow their children to eat it. One employee remembered seeing a family of baby mice in a tote of peanuts, and others recalled having to step over standing water inside the building after heavy rain.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;ref name="ch3"&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-peanut-newfeb04,0,1819241.story Inside 'nasty' nut processor - Ex-employees say rodents, roaches and mold commonplace], [[Chicago Tribune]], February 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Another former employee told [[CBS News]] that he saw a rat dry-roasting in a peanut area.&lt;ref name="cbs3"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/03/earlyshow/health/main4771754.shtml Worker: I Saw Rat Roasting In Peanut Plant], CBS News, February 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Another told [[ABC News]] that workers had no idea the company had positive ''Salmonella'' tests because "that information is not for the average employee to see."&lt;ref name="abc11"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=6848906&amp;page=1 Lawmakers Examine Peanut Recall], [[ABC News]], February 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Food and Drug Administration====
[[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) inspectors reported, following a two-week inspection of the Blakely, Georgia, plant in January 2009, that the company had information that its peanut-butter products were tainted with ''Salmonella'', but shipped them anyway after "retesting" them.

On February 6, 2009, the FDA reported that the company shipped tainted products under three conditions: (1) without retesting, (2) before the retest results came back from an outside company, and (3) after a second test showed no bacterial contamination.&lt;ref name="cnn6"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/02/06/peanut.butter/index.html FDA: Peanut plant knew product was tainted with Salmonella], CNN, February 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In all three cases, the initial positive result means that the product should have been destroyed. Food safety experts say ''Salmonella'' can live in pockets of peanut butter, so that one batch could test both negative and positive. In that case, it should have been destroyed, they said.&lt;ref name="wp_1"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/02/AR2009020202967.html Obama Faults FDA on Food Safety], [[Washington Post]], February 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents released February 11 by the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee]] showed that the company shipped products to customers even before receiving results of ''Salmonella ''tests, and the company stopped using a private laboratory because too many tests done there showed contamination.&lt;ref name="nyt11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bb11"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=anHgQNdceh8o&amp;refer=us Peanut Corp.

===Texas===
The company had operated a plant in [[Gorman, Texas|Gorman]], where the company originally started in 1977.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} David Brooks, the snack food company buyer interviewed by the ''Washington Post'' after the ''Salmonella'' outbreak, said that he inspected this plant three times on behalf of his company in the mid-1980s to determine whether to buy peanuts from PCA. The plant failed his private inspection each time for what he called "just filthy" conditions, including dusty beams, leaky roofs, and birds flying through the building.&lt;ref name="wp0215"/&gt; The Gorman operations transferred to Plainview when [[Hale County, Texas|Hale County]] officials issued $2&amp;nbsp;million in tax-free revenue bonds to help the company convert a long vacant [[Jimmy Dean (brand)|Jimmy Dean]] sausage factory into a peanut plant.&lt;ref name="DMN0301"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jacobson, Sherry | date = March 1, 2009 | title = Plant dodged scrutiny: All in Texas town knew of peanut processor, but state was in dark | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&amp;p_theme=dm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_hidethis=no&amp;p_field_label-0=Author&amp;p_field_label-1=title&amp;p_bool_label-1=AND&amp;p_text_label-1=Plant%20dodged%20scrutiny&amp;p_field_label-2=Section&amp;p_bool_label-2=AND&amp;s_dispstring=headline(Plant%20dodged%20scrutiny)%20AND%20date(all)&amp;xcal_numdocs=40&amp;p_perpage=20&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:A&amp;xcal_useweights=no | access-date = 11 December 2015 | ref = Document ID, 126AC150A5D26368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Local officials, including a county health inspector, toured the new plant and approved its opening, although the state said it never knew the plant existed. The plant was located along a major highway, across from a large Wal-Mart distribution center; it had four highly visible signs in the front and a billboard bearing a picture of a peanut. A state inspector who drove by the plant "a few times" on his way to other inspections never stopped because it was not on his list. State officials said the company was solely to blame for failing to obtain the food manufacturer's license when the Plainview plant opened.&lt;ref name="DMN0301"/&gt;

The company's plant in Plainview opened in March 2005 and employed 30 people, but was never licensed in that state as a food manufacturing facility; the state had not done any inspections until the problems with the Georgia plant became news.&lt;ref name="amr"/&gt;  The Texas plant [[Blanching (cooking)|blanched]], dry- and oil-roasted, and chopped peanuts, then shipped them to food companies across the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The plant had been certified for organic production in November 2005, based on what state officials later called incomplete information obtained by an inspector with the [[Texas Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/14/business/14peanut.html Peanut Corporation of America to Liquidate], ''New York Times'', February 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, the company failed to apply for a Texas health certificate, which would have triggered a visit by state inspectors.&lt;ref name="hc0212"&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/hotstories/6261463.html All peanuts from Texas plant are recalled], [[Houston Chronicle]], February 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; State health officials were not aware the plant existed until the company released a list of its plants around the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/stories/DN-peanuts__13nat.ART0.State.Edition1.4e39f45.html Texas issues emergency recall of Plainview peanut plant's products], ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', February 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Texas inspection in January 2009 found some unsanitary conditions, such as unclean sections of a peanut-roasting line. It also reported that several internal company laboratory tests dating back to November had found no ''Salmonella'' or other contaminants.&lt;ref name="amr"&gt;[http://www.connectamarillo.com/news/news_story.aspx?id=254624 Plainview peanut plant raises questions], Connect [[Amarillo]], February 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, on February 10, 2009, company officials announced that the Texas plant had been shut down, after samples taken on February 4 tested positive for ''Salmonella''.&lt;ref name="txplant"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/10/AR2009021001933.html Salmonella Fears Shutter Second Peanut Processing Plant], ''[[Washington Post]]'', February 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="txshutdown"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/02/10/texas.peanut.butter.company/ Texas unit of Georgia peanut company halts operations], CNN, February 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Former workers at the Texas plant interviewed by the ''New York Times'' said that the facility was "disgusting".

On February 12, 2009 Texas health officials ordered an unprecedented recall of all products ever shipped from the Texas plant since it opened in 2005, after discovering that the plant's air-handling system was drawing in debris from a crawl space containing "dead rodents, rodent excrement and bird feathers" into production areas.&lt;ref name="txrecal"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-02-12-salmonella-recall_N.htm Texas recalls all products from Salmonella-infected plant], ''[[USA Today]]'', February 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PlainView"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/02/12/peanut.butter.recall/ Dead rodents, excrement in peanut processor lead to recall], CNN, February 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; State health officials said they issued the sweeping recall because they did not know how long the unsanitary conditions had existed at the plant.&lt;ref name="WaPoBankrupt"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/13/AR2009021302053.html Peanut Corp. of America files for bankruptcy], [[Associated Press]] via ''[[The Washington Post]]'', February 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal proceedings==

===Georgia Investigation===
[[Tommy Irvin]], commissioner of the [[Georgia Department of Agriculture]] (GDA), requested [[criminal investigation]] of the [[Georgia Bureau of Investigation]] (GBI) as the organ responsible for inspections contracted by the FDA. GDA and GBI officials had said they would consider pursuing [[manslaughter]] charges if federal authorities did not take up the case.&lt;ref name="fi31"/&gt; On January 30, 2009, federal health officials announced that a criminal investigation had been launched by the [[U.S. Justice Department]] for possible prosecution under provisions of the 1938 [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]].&lt;ref name="ap40"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fi31"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5icC3O6F1Y1BEtxB5hZV3KXyib2jQD9628DJO0 Feds rarely file charges in tainted food cases], [[Associated Press]], January 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="at31"&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/services/content/news/stories/2009/01/31/peanut0131.html Federal criminal probe targets peanut plant], [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]], January 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wps31"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/30/AR2009013003422.html FDA Investigating Peanut Company Behind Recall], ''[[Washington Post]]'', January 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On February 4, Georgia officials said they would not prosecute the company, because the two state laws under consideration (reckless conduct and adulteration of food) were only misdemeanors and would only allow for minor penalties. [[Vernon Keenan]], director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, said: "Any potential prosecution is most appropriately handled at the federal level".&lt;ref name="atl0206"/&gt;

U.S. District Judge W. Louis Sands stated during sentencing, "We place faith that no one would intentionally ship products to market that are contaminated….

Judge Sands addressed Mary Wilkerson, Quality Assurance Manager for PCA, "You were aware of what was going on and played a role in concealing the problem.

The prosecution team asked the court to find that the Parnell brothers were flight risks and to deny them bail while they appeal their convictions. The prosecutors did not ask the same for Wilkerson. Judge Sands dismissed defense team allegations of prosecutorial misconduct and a "less-than-unbiased jury." He also addressed defense objections to the victims' testimony, citing their constitutional rights.  The judge then announced that the character witnesses and families of the two Parnell brothers hurt their argument that the two men would not be a flight risk by talking about Stewart Parnell's hobby of being a licensed pilot and flying all over the country, their family resources, and their many connections around the world. Judge Sands ordered that the two Parnell brothers be taken into custody of the U.S. Marshals while allowing bail for Wilkerson (stating that she did not pose the same flight risk without the same access to resources) until the Bureau of Prisons directs her to appear at a specified time and place to begin her sentence.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/11/briefs-filed-in-criminal-appeals-of-peanut-corporation-of-america-cases/|title=Appeal briefs filed for Peanut Corporation of America criminal cases - Food Safety News|author=|date=November 28, 2016|website=foodsafetynews.com|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2017/mar/9/peanut-company-executives-appeal-prison-sentences-rare-corporate-prosecution/|title=Peanut Company Executives Appeal Prison Sentences in Rare Corporate Prosecution - Prison Legal News|author=|date=|website=www.prisonlegalnews.org|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/4-indicted-in-tainted-peanut-butter-outbreak-that-killed-3-minnesotans/192312011/|title=Peanut Corp. owner, 3 workers indicted in deadly salmonella outbreak|author=|date=|website=startribune.com|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wqscert.com/wqscert/en/noticia/visualizar/codnoticia/487/parnell-brothers-finally-in-prison-for-deadly-peanut-butter-outbreak.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bankruptcy==
On February 13, 2009— less than 24 hours after the Texas recall—Peanut Corporation of America announced it was permanently halting operations and filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Bankruptcy lawyer Andrew Goldstein said that the company had considered filing for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]], but decided to liquidate because all of its plants had been shut down and there was no way it could carry on business.&lt;ref name="bb13"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=al9aOLMU4CQ8&amp;refer=home  Peanut Corp. to Liquidate Following Salmonella Deaths], [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], February 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Consumers Union]] criticised the move, saying that the bankruptcy filing would shield the company from liability suits,&lt;ref name="cu-bankruptcy"&gt;[http://www.consumersunion.org/pub/core_food_safety/009425.html CU statement in response to PCA bankruptcy], [[Consumers Union]], February 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; although in reality, the bankruptcy filing merely delays any claims against the company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/13/AR2009021303420.html Peanut Company Files for Bankruptcy Protection], Washington Post, February 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsadvance.com/work_it_lynchburg/news/imprisoned-peanut-exec-won-t-have-to-pay-salmonella-victims/article_70a1b9fa-fce1-11e5-8112-cfe6fda242c0.html|title=Imprisoned peanut exec won't have to pay salmonella victims|first=Associated|last=Press|date=|website=newsadvance.com|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/article_0433af7a-0931-52e9-8ea7-bdeaba676d49.html|title=$12 million fund established for salmonella victims|first=Ray|last=Reed|date=|website=newsadvance.com|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/judge-recommends-m-settlement-in-pca-case/article_f0857bfa-11db-5c15-b852-c59209466624.html|title=Judge recommends $12M settlement in PCA case|first=Chris|last=Dumond|date=|website=newsadvance.com|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other federal action ==
Parnell served on the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'s Peanut Standards Board, which sets quality and handling standards for peanuts.&lt;ref name="atl31"/&gt; He was first appointed by Agriculture Secretary [[Mike Johanns]] to the position in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://southwestfarmpress.com/mag/farming_six_appointed_peanut/ Six appointed to Peanut Standards Board] Southwest Farm Press, September 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and was reappointed for another term that would have expired in 2011,&lt;ref name="atl31"/&gt; but on February 5, 2009, the USDA announced that the new Agriculture Secretary [[Tom Vilsack]] had removed Parnell from the board.&lt;ref name="n6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vs1"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jeLgwCG-FEEYH8KZ7Tt45zOdSIKgD966U5C00 Small company in Salmonella scandal had wide reach], [[Associated Press]], February 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 2009, the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) announced that Peanut Corporation of America and a subsidiary, Tidewater Blanching LLC, were banned from all federal government contracts and subcontracts for one year, saying the company: "lacks business integrity and business honesty, which seriously and directly hinders its ability to do business with the federal government."&lt;ref name="atl0206"&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/traffic/content/metro/stories/2009/02/06/peanut_roundup.html Salmonella outbreak’s pain spreads], [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]], February 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt5"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/health/06peanut.html?ref=us Peanut Supplier Banned From Federal Business], ''New York Times'', February 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Owner==
Peanut Corporation of America was founded and originally owned by Hugh Parnell, father of Stewart Parnell,&lt;ref name="wp0215"/&gt; but by the time of the contamination scandal had passed to Stewart Parnell as sole owner,&lt;ref name="wp0215"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uts"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/09/21/peanut-executive-salmonella-sentencing/72549166 Peanut executive sentenced to 28 years], ''[[USA Today]]'', September 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and as president and CEO of the company.&lt;ref name="lat6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atl31"&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2009/01/31/parnell_0201.html Troubled peanut firm’s chief also an industry quality adviser], [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]], January 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vs1"/&gt;

Hugh Parnell started in the peanut business with Stewart Parnell and his two younger brothers in 1977; they took a struggling, $50,000-a-year peanut roasting operation and turned it into a $30&amp;nbsp;million business before selling the business in 1994-1995, after which Stewart Parnell continued on as a consultant until re-buying the Gorman, Texas plant in 2000.&lt;ref name="wp0215"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ap12"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Blackledge, Brett J. &amp; Lindsey, Sue ([[Associated Press|AP]]) | date = February 13, 2009 | title = Peanut plant owner becomes recluse after outbreak | url = http://www.trentonian.com/article/TT/20090213/FINANCE01/302139958 | access-date = 12 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he bought the Blakely, Georgia operation,&lt;ref name="vs1"/&gt; when its operations consisted only of roasting and blanching peanuts.&lt;ref name="atl_f"/&gt; Parnell tripled revenue at the Blakely plant by 2004, turning its first profit in 15 years,&lt;ref name="pca"/&gt; with production regularly surpassing 2.5&amp;nbsp;million pounds of peanuts per month.&lt;ref name="pcabl"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071210164202/http://www.peanutcorp.com/GAmain.htm Peanut Corporation of America's Blakely, Georgia Plant], Peanut Corporation of America website, retrieved February 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the FDA did not know that the plant manufactured peanut butter until the 2008-2009 outbreak.&lt;ref name="atl_f"&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/feeds/content/metro/stories/2009/02/08/peanut_0208.html?cxtype=rss&amp;cxsvc=7&amp;cxcat=13 Food risks draw little urgency], [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]], February 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parnells ran PCA on a very tight budget.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The company, under Hugh Parnell, who operated a bare-bones front office and used minimum-wage labor,&lt;ref name="wp0215"/&gt; a style that was continued by Stewart Parnell, who ran his newly acquired PCA from a converted garage behind Parnell's home in an upscale suburb outside of Lynchburg, Virginia, and continued to rely on minimum-wage labor.&lt;ref name="wp0215"/&gt;

Despite more than 12 tests between 2007 and 2008 that showed ''Salmonella'' contamination in his company's products, Parnell wrote an email to company employees on January 12, 2009, that stated, "We have never found any salmonella at all. No salmonella has been found anywhere in our products or in our plants."&lt;ref name="nyt11"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/health/policy/12peanut.html?hp Peanut Company Sent Products Before Test Results], ''New York Times'', February 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emails"/&gt; Parnell ordered products identified with ''Salmonella'' to be shipped and complained that tests discovering the contaminated food were "costing us huge $$$$$." In a June 2008 email exchange, Parnell complained to a worker after being notified that ''Salmonella'' had been found in more products. "I go thru this about once a week," he wrote. "I will hold my breath ... again."&lt;ref name="emails"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jeLgwCG-FEEYH8KZ7Tt45zOdSIKgD969THS80 Peanut butter outbreak prompts tighter food safety], Associated Press, February 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After the company was identified as the source of the outbreak, Parnell pressed federal regulators to allow him to continue using peanuts from the tainted plant. He wrote that company executives "desperately at least need to turn the raw peanuts on our floor into money."&lt;ref name="nyt11"/&gt;

Under Congressional [[subpoena]], Parnell on February 11 appeared with his plant manager before a [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Energy and Commerce]] subcommittee, but repeatedly refused to testify, citing their [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] protection against self-incrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_0bEA7OriU|title=C-SPAN:  Peanut Corp. of America Owner  Pleads the 5th|first=|last=C-SPAN|date=February 11, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=July 8, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="5th"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jeLgwCG-FEEYH8KZ7Tt45zOdSIKgD969HAB00 Peanut company owner refuses to testify], [[Associated Press]], February 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="5thCNN"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/11/congress.peanut.butter/ Peanut company officials spurn Congress' questions], CNN, February 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the questions they refused to answer was one from Rep.

In 1897, [[William H. Welch]] created the name ''Plasmodium falciparum'', which [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] formally adopted in 1954. ''P. falciparum'' assumes several different forms during its life cycle. The human-infective stage are [[Apicomplexan life cycle|sporozoites]] from the [[Salivary gland#Other animals|salivary gland of a mosquito]]. The sporozoites grow and multiply in the [[liver]] to become merozoites. These merozoites invade the [[Red blood cell|erythrocytes]] (RBCs) to form trophozoites, schizonts and gametocytes, during which the symptoms of malaria are produced. In the mosquito, the [[Gametocyte|gametocytes]] undergo sexual reproduction to a [[zygote]], which turns into ookinete. Ookinete forms [[Oocyte|oocyts]] from which sporozoites are formed.

As of the latest ''World Malaria Report'' of the [[World Health Organization]], there were 219 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2017, up from 216 million cases in 2016.

===Discovery===
A German physician, [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]], must have been the first to see ''P. falciparum'' but not knowing what it was. In 1847 he reported the presence of black pigment granules from the blood and spleen of a patient who died of malaria. The French Army physician [[Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran]], while working at Bône Hospital (now [[Annaba]] in Algeria), correctly identified the parasite as a causative pathogen of malaria in 1880. He presented his discovery before the [[French Academy of Medicine]] in Paris, and published it in ''[[The Lancet]]'', in 1881. He gave the scientific name ''Oscillaria malariae''.&lt;ref name=lalchhandama&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lalchhandama|first1=K.|title=The making of modern malariology: from miasma to mosquito- malaria theory|journal=Science Vision|date=2014|volume=14|issue=1|pages=3–17|url=http://www.sciencevision.org/current_issue/dl/Lalchhandama.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427025145/http://www.sciencevision.org/current_issue/dl/Lalchhandama.pdf|archivedate=2014-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But his discovery was received with skepticism mainly because by that time leading physicians such as [[Edwin Klebs|Theodor Albrecht Edwin Klebs]] and [[Corrado Tommasi-Crudeli]] claimed that they had discovered a bacterium (which they called ''Bacillus malariae'') as the pathogen of malaria. Laveran's discovery was widely accepted only after five years when [[Camillo Golgi]] confirmed the parasite using better microscope and staining technique. Laveran was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1907 for his work. In 1900, the Italian zoologist [[Giovanni Battista Grassi]] categorized ''[[Plasmodium]]'' species based on the timing of fever in the patient; malignant tertian malaria was caused by ''Laverania malariae'' (now ''P. falciparum''), benign tertian malaria by ''Haemamoeba vivax'' (now ''[[Plasmodium vivax|P. vivax]]''), and quartan malaria by ''Haemamoeba malariae'' (now ''[[Plasmodium malariae|P. malariae]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Francis EG|title=History of the discovery of the malaria parasites and their vectors|journal=Parasites &amp; Vectors|date=2010|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.1186/1756-3305-3-5|pmid=20205846|pmc=2825508}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The British physician [[Patrick Manson]] formulated the [[mosquito-malaria theory]] in 1894; until that time, malarial parasites were believed to be spread in air as [[Miasma theory|miasma]], a Greek word for pollution.&lt;ref name=lalchhandama/&gt;  His colleague [[Ronald Ross]], a British Army surgeon, travelled to India to test the theory. Ross discovered in 1897 that malarial parasite lived in certain mosquitoes. The next year, he demonstrated that a malarial parasite of birds could be transmitted by mosquitoes from one bird to another. Around the same time, Grassi demonstrated that ''P. falciparum'' was transmitted in humans only by female anopheline mosquito (in his case ''[[Anopheles claviger]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baccetti|first1=B|title=History of the early dipteran systematics in Italy: from Lyncei to Battista Grassi|journal=Parassitologia|date=2008|volume=50|issue=3-4|pages=167–172|pmid=20055226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross, Manson and Grassi were nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1902.

''P. falciparum'' does not have a fixed structure but undergoes continuous change during the course of its life cycle. A sporozoite is spindle-shaped and 10-15 μm long. In the liver it grows into an ovoid schizont of 30-70 μm in diameter. Each schizont produces merozoites, each of which is roughly 1.5 μm in length and 1 μm in diameter. In the erythrocyte the merozoite form a ring-like structure, becoming a trophozoite. A trophozoites feed on the haemoglobin and forms a granular pigment called [[haemozoin]]. Unlike those of other ''Plasmodium'' species, the gametocytes of ''P. falciparum'' are elongated and crescent-shaped, by which they are sometimes identified. A mature gametocyte is 8-12 μm long and 3-6 μm wide. The ookinete is also elongated measuring about 18-24 μm. An oocyst is rounded and can grow up to 80 μm in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lucius|first1=R.|last2=Roberts|first2=C.W.|editor1-last=Lucius|editor1-first=R.|editor2-last=Loos-Frank|editor2-first=B.|editor3-last=Lane|editor3-first=R.P.|editor4-last=Poulin|editor4-first=R.|editor5-last=Roberts|editor5-first=C.W.|editor6-last=Grencis|editor6-first=R.K.|title=The Biology of Parasites|date=2017|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-3-527-32848-2|pages=190–198|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=w8bXDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg|chapter=Biology of Parasitic Protozoa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microscopic examination of a blood film reveals only early (ring-form) trophozoites and gametocytes that are in the peripheral blood.

The apical complex, which is actually a combination of organelles, is an important structure. It contains secretory organelles called rhoptries and micronemes, which are vital for mobility, adhesion, host cell invasion, and parasitophorous vacuole formation.&lt;ref name=garcia06/&gt; As an [[apicomplexan]], it harbours a plastid, an [[apicoplast]], similar to plant [[chloroplast]]s, which they probably acquired by engulfing (or being invaded by) a [[eukaryotic]] [[Algae|alga]] and retaining the algal plastid as a distinctive [[organelle]] [[Symbiogenesis|encased within four membranes]]. The apicoplast is involved in the synthesis of [[lipid]]s and several other compounds and provides an attractive drug target. During the asexual blood stage of infection, an essential function of the apicoplast is to produce the isoprenoid precursors [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] (IPP) and [[dimethylallyl pyrophosphate]] (DMAPP) via the [[MEP pathway|MEP (non-mevalonate) pathway]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeh|first=Ellen|last2=DeRisi|first2=Joseph L.|date=2011-08-30|title=Chemical Rescue of Malaria Parasites Lacking an Apicoplast Defines Organelle Function in Blood-Stage ''Plasmodium falciparum''|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001138|journal=PLOS Biol|volume=9|issue=8|pages=e1001138|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001138|issn=1545-7885|pmc=3166167|pmid=21912516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans are the intermediate hosts in which asexual reproduction occurs, and female anopheline mosquitos are the definitive hosts harbouring the sexual reproduction stage.

===In humans===

Infection in humans begins with the bite of an infected female ''Anopheles'' mosquito. Out of about 460 species of  ''[[Anopheles]]'' [[mosquito]], more than 70 species transmit falciparum malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molina-Cruz|first1=Alvaro|last2=Zilversmit|first2=Martine M.|last3=Neafsey|first3=Daniel E.|last4=Hartl|first4=Daniel L.|last5=Barillas-Mury|first5=Carolina|title=Mosquito Vectors and the Globalization of ''Plasmodium falciparum'' Malaria|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|date=2016|volume=50|issue=1|pages=447–465|doi=10.1146/annurev-genet-120215-035211|pmid=27732796}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]'' is one of the best known and most prevalent vectors, particularly in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sinka|first1=Marianne E|last2=Bangs|first2=Michael J|last3=Manguin|first3=Sylvie|last4=Coetzee|first4=Maureen|last5=Mbogo|first5=Charles M|last6=Hemingway|first6=Janet|last7=Patil|first7=Anand P|last8=Temperley|first8=Will H|last9=Gething|first9=Peter W|last10=Kabaria|first10=Caroline W|last11=Okara|first11=Robi M|last12=Van Boeckel|first12=Thomas|last13=Godfray|first13=H Charles J|last14=Harbach|first14=Ralph E|last15=Hay|first15=Simon I|title=The dominant ''Anopheles'' vectors of human malaria in Africa, Europe and the Middle East: occurrence data, distribution maps and bionomic pr?cis|journal=Parasites &amp; Vectors|date=2010|volume=3|issue=1|pages=117|doi=10.1186/1756-3305-3-117|pmid=21129198|pmc=3016360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The infective stage called [[Apicomplexan life cycle|sporozoites]] released from the salivary glands through the proboscis of the mosquito enter the bloodstream during feeding. The mosquito saliva contains antihemostatic and anti-inflammatory enzymes that disrupt blood clotting and inhibit the pain reaction. Typically, each infected bite contains 20-200 sporozoites.&lt;ref name=garcia06&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia|first1=J. E.|last2=Puentes|first2=A.|last3=Patarroyo|first3=M.

====Liver stage or exo-erythrocytic schizogony====

Entering the hepatocytes, the parasite loses its [[apical complex]] and surface coat, and transforms into a [[trophozoite]].  Within the [[parasitophorous vacuole]] of the hepatocyte, it undergoes 13-14 rounds of mitosis and meiosis which produce a syncytial cell ([[coenocyte]]) called a schizont. This process is called schizogony. A schizont contains tens of thousands of nuclei. From the surface of the schizont, tens of thousands of haploid (1n) daughter cells called merozoites emerge. The liver stage can produce up to 90,000 merozoites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vaughan|first1=Ashley M.|last2=Kappe|first2=Stefan H.I.|title=Malaria Parasite Liver Infection and Exoerythrocytic Biology|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine|date=2017|volume=7|issue=6|pages=a025486|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a025486|pmid=28242785}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are eventually released into the bloodstream in parasite-filled vesicles called merosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sturm|first1=A.|title=Manipulation of Host Hepatocytes by the Malaria Parasite for Delivery into Liver Sinusoids|journal=Science|date=2006|volume=313|issue=5791|pages=1287–1290|doi=10.1126/science.1129720|bibcode=2006Sci...313.1287S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blood stage or erythrocytic schizogony====
[[Merozoites]] use the [[apicomplexan]] invasion organelles ([[apical complex]], pellicle and surface coat) to recognize and enter the host erythrocyte (red blood cell). The parasite first binds to the erythrocyte in a random orientation. It then reorients such that the apical complex is in proximity to the erythrocyte membrane. The parasite forms a parasitophorous vacuole, to allow for its development inside the [[erythrocyte]].&lt;ref name=cowman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cowman|first1=Alan F.|last2=Crabb|first2=Brendan S.|title=Invasion of Red Blood Cells by Malaria Parasites|journal=Cell|date=2006|volume=124|issue=4|pages=755–766|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.02.006|pmid=16497586}}&lt;/ref&gt; This infection cycle occurs in a highly synchronous fashion, with roughly all of the parasites throughout the blood in the same stage of development. This precise clocking mechanism has been shown to be dependent on the human host's own [[circadian rhythm]].&lt;ref name="1.5.2"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Malaria eModule - SYNCHRONICITY  | work =  | publisher =
  | date =  | url = http://www.impact-malaria.com/FR/EPS/Formations_et_cours_internationaux/Formation_de_la_Liverpool_School_LSTMH/cours_liverpool/Unit_1/1_5_2.html  | doi =  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the erythrocyte, the parasite metabolism depends on the digestion of [[hemoglobin]]. The clinical symptoms of malaria such as fever, anemia, and neurological disorder are produced during the blood stage.&lt;ref name="gerald"/&gt;

The parasite can also alter the morphology of the erythrocyte, causing knobs on the erythrocyte membrane. Infected erythrocytes are often sequestered in various human tissues or organs, such as the heart, liver and brain.  This is caused by parasite-derived cell surface proteins being present on the erythrocyte membrane, and it is these proteins that bind to receptors on human cells. Sequestration in the brain causes cerebral malaria, a very severe form of the disease, which increases the victim's likelihood of death.

=====Trophozoite=====
After invading the erythrocyte, the parasite loses its specific invasion organelles (apical complex and surface coat) and de-differentiates into a round trophozoite located within a parasitophorous vacuole. The young trophozoite (or "ring" stage, because of its morphology on stained blood films) grows substantially before undergoing schizogony.&lt;ref name="1.5"&gt;{{cite web | title = Malaria eModule - ASEXUAL ERYTHROCYTIC STAGES | work = | publisher =

=====Schizont=====
At the schizont stage, the parasite replicates its DNA multiple times and multiple mitotic divisions occur asynchronously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Read | first1 = M. | last2 = Sherwin | first2 = T. | last3 = Holloway | first3 = S.

J. Parasitol. | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 71–80 | doi=10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each schizont forms 16-18 merozoites.&lt;ref name="1.5"/&gt; The red blood cells are ruptured by the merozoites. The liberated merozoites invade fresh erythrocytes. A free merozoite is in the bloodstream for roughly 60 seconds before it enters another erythrocyte.&lt;ref name=cowman/&gt;

The duration of each blood stage is approximately 48 hours. This gives rise to the characteristic clinical manifestations of falciparum malaria, such as fever and chills, corresponding to the synchronous rupture of the infected erythrocytes.&lt;ref name=trampuz03&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trampuz|first1=Andrej|last2=Jereb|first2=Matjaz|last3=Muzlovic|first3=Igor|last4=Prabhu|first4=Rajesh M|title=Clinical review: Severe malaria|journal=Critical Care|date=2003|volume=7|issue=4|pages=315|doi=10.1186/cc2183|pmid=12930555|pmc=270697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Gametocyte=====
Not all of the merozoites divide into schizonts; some get differentiated into sexual forms, male and female [[gametocyte]]s. These gametocytes take roughly 7–15 days to reach full maturity, through the process called gametocytogenesis. These gametocytes are taken up by a female ''Anopheles'' mosquito during a blood meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Talman|first1=Arthur M|last2=Domarle|first2=Olivier|last3=McKenzie|first3=F|last4=Ariey|first4=Frédéric|last5=Robert|first5=Vincent|title=Gametocytogenesis: the puberty of ''Plasmodium falciparum''|journal=Malaria Journal|date=2004|volume=3|issue=1|pages=24|doi=10.1186/1475-2875-3-24|pmid=15253774|pmc=497046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incubation period===
The time of appearance of the symptoms from infection (called [[incubation period]]) is shortest for ''P. falciparum'' among ''Plasmodium'' species. An average incubation period is 11 days,&lt;ref name=trampuz03/&gt; but may range from 9 to 30 days. In isolated cases, prolonged incubation period as long as 2, 3 or even 8 years have been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartoloni|first1=A|last2=Zammarchi|first2=L|title=Clinical aspects of uncomplicated and severe malaria|journal=Mediterranean Journal of Hematology and infectious diseases|date=2012|volume=4|issue=1|pages=e2012026|doi=10.4084/MJHID.2012.026|pmid=22708041|pmc=3375727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pregnancy and co-infection with HIV are important conditions for delayed symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D'Ortenzio|first1=E|last2=Godineau|first2=N|last3=Fontanet|first3=A|last4=Houze|first4=S|last5=Bouchaud|first5=O|last6=Matheron|first6=S|last7=Le Bras|first7=J|title=Prolonged ''Plasmodium falciparum'' infection in immigrants, Paris|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|date=2008|volume=14|issue=2|pages=323-326|doi=10.3201/eid1402.061475|pmid=18258132|pmc=2600192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parasites can be detected from blood samples by the 10th day after infection (pre-patent period).&lt;ref name=trampuz03/&gt;

===In mosquitoes===

Within the mosquito midgut, the female gamete maturation process entails slight morphological changes, becoming more enlarged and spherical. The male gametocyte undergoes a rapid nuclear division within 15 minutes, producing eight [[flagellum|flagellated]] microgametes by a process called exflagellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sinden|first1=R. E.|last2=Canning|first2=E. U.|last3=Bray|first3=R. S.|last4=Smalley|first4=M. E.|title=Gametocyte and Gamete Development in ''Plasmodium falciparum''|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=1978|volume=201|issue=1145|pages=375–399|doi=10.1098/rspb.1978.0051|bibcode=1978RSPSB.201..375S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flagellated microgamete fertilizes the female macrogamete to produce a [[diploid]] cell called a [[zygote]]. The zygote then develops into an [[ookinete]]. The ookinete is a motile cell, capable of invading other organs of the mosquito. It traverses the [[peritrophic membrane]] of the mosquito midgut and crosses the midgut epithelium. Once through the epithelium, the ookinete enters the [[basal lamina]], and settles to an immotile [[oocyst]]. For several days, the oocyst undergoes 10 to 11 rounds of cell division to create a [[syncytium|syncytial]] cell (sporoblast) containing thousands of nuclei. Meiosis takes place inside the sporoblast to produce over 3,000 haploid daughter cells called sporozoites on the surface of the mother cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rungsiwongse|first1=Jarasporn|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Ronald|title=The Number of Sporozoites Produced by Individual Malaria Oocysts|journal=The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|date=1991|volume=45|issue=5|pages=574–577|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.1991.45.574}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immature sporozoites break through the oocyst wall into the [[haemolymph]]. They migrate to the mosquito salivary glands where they undergo further development and become infective to humans.&lt;ref name="gerald"/&gt;

==Interaction with human immune system==
===Immune response===
A single anopheline mosquito can transmit hundreds of ''P. falciparum'' sporozoites in a single bite under experimental conditions. But in nature the number is generally less than 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beier|first1=JC|last2=Onyango|first2=FK|last3=Koros|first3=JK|last4=Ramadhan|first4=M|last5=Ogwang|first5=R|last6=Wirtz|first6=RA|last7=Koech|first7=DK|last8=Roberts|first8=CR|title=Quantitation of malaria sporozoites transmitted in vitro during salivation by wild Afrotropical Anopheles|journal=Medical and Veterinary Entomology|date=1991|volume=5|issue=1|pages=71-9|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2915.1991.tb00523.x|pmid=1768903}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sporozoites do not enter the blood stream directly and remain in the skin tissue for 2 to 3 hours. About 15–20% sporozoites enter the lymphatic system where they activate [[dendritic cells]], which send them for destruction by T lymphocytes ([[Cytotoxic T cell|CD8+ T cells]]). At 48 hours after infection, ''Plasmodium''-specific CD8+ T cells can be detected in the [[lymph nodes]] connected to the skin cells.&lt;ref name=chakravarty&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chakravarty|first1=Sumana|last2=Cockburn|first2=Ian A|last3=Kuk|first3=Salih|last4=Overstreet|first4=Michael G|last5=Sacci|first5=John B|last6=Zavala|first6=Fidel|title=CD8+ T lymphocytes protective against malaria liver stages are primed in skin-draining lymph nodes|journal=Nature Medicine|date=2007|volume=13|issue=9|pages=1035–1041|doi=10.1038/nm1628|pmid=17704784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the sporozites remaining in the skin tissue are subsequently killed by the [[innate immune system]]. The sporozoite glycoprotein specifically activates [[mast cells]]. The mast cells then produce [[Cytokine|signalling molecules]] such as [[TNFα]] and MIP-2, which activate cell eaters (professional phagocytes) such as [[neutrophils]] and [[macrophages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopp|first1=Christine S.|last2=Sinnis|first2=Photini|title=The innate and adaptive response to mosquito saliva and Plasmodium sporozoites in the skin|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=2015|volume=1342|issue=1|pages=37–43|doi=10.1111/nyas.12661|pmid=25694058|pmc=4405444|bibcode=2015NYASA1342...37H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a small number (0.5-5%) of sporozoites enter the blood stream into the liver. In the liver, the activated CD8+ T cells from the lymph bind the sporozoites through the [[circumsporozoite protein]] (CSP).&lt;ref name=chakravarty/&gt; [[Antigen presentation]] by dendritic cells in the skin tissue to T cells is also a crucial process. From this stage onward the parasites produce different proteins that help in suppressing communication of the immune cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gomes|first1=Pollyanna S.|last2=Bhardwaj|first2=Jyoti|last3=Rivera-Correa|first3=Juan|last4=Freire-De-Lima|first4=Celio G.|last5=Morrot|first5=Alexandre|title=Immune Escape Strategies of Malaria Parasites|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|date=2016|volume=7|page=e1617|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2016.01617|pmid=27799922|pmc=5066453}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even at the height of the infection when RBCs are ruptured, the immune signals are not strong enough to activate macrophages or [[natural killer cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Artavanis-Tsakonas|first1=K|last2=Tongren|first2=JE|last3=Riley|first3=EM|title=The war between the malaria parasite and the immune system: immunity, immunoregulation and immunopathology|journal=Clinical and Experimental Immunology|date=August 2003|volume=133|issue=2|pages=145-152|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2249.2003.02174.x|pmid=12869017|pmc=1808775}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During erythrocyte invasion, merozoites release merozoite cap protein-1 (MCP1), apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1), erythrocyte-binding antigens (EBA), myosin A tail domain interacting protein (MTIP), and merozoite surface proteins (MSPs).&lt;ref name=florens/&gt; Of these MSPs, MSP1 and MSP2 are primarily responsible for avoiding immune cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Satchwell|first1=T.

== Pathogenesis ==
{{Main|Malaria}}
The clinical symptoms of falciparum malaria are produced by the rupture of schizont and destruction of erythrocytes. Most of the patients experience [[fever]] (&gt;92% of cases), [[chills]] (79%), [[headaches]] (70%), and [[sweating]] (64%). [[Dizziness]], [[malaise]], [[myalgia|muscle pain]], [[abdominal pain]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], mild [[diarrhea]], and [[dry cough]] are also generally associated. [[Tachycardia|High heartrate]], [[jaundice]], [[pallor]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], [[hepatomegaly|enlarged liver]], and [[splenomegaly|enlarged spleen]] are also diagnosed.&lt;ref name=trampuz03/&gt;

''P. falciparum'' works via sequestration, a distinctive property not shared by few other ''Plasmodiae''. The mature schizonts change the surface properties of infected erythrocytes, causing them to stick to blood vessel walls (cytoadherence). This leads to obstruction of the microcirculation and results in dysfunction of multiple organs, such as the brain in [[cerebral malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dondorp AM, Pongponratn E, White NJ |title=Reduced microcirculatory flow in severe falciparum malaria: pathophysiology and electron-microscopic pathology |journal=Acta Trop. |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=309–17 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14744557 |doi= 10.1016/j.actatropica.2003.10.004|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''P. falciparum'' is responsible for (almost) all severe human illnesses and deaths due to malaria, in a condition called complicated or severe malaria. Complicated malaria occurs more commonly in children under age 5,&lt;ref name="trampuz03"/&gt; and sometimes in pregnant women (a condition specifically called [[pregnancy-associated malaria]]).&lt;ref name=moya14&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moya-Alvarez|first1=Violeta|last2=Abellana|first2=Rosa|last3=Cot|first3=Michel|title=Pregnancy-associated malaria and malaria in infants: an old problem with present consequences|journal=Malaria Journal|date=2014|volume=13|issue=1|pages=271|doi=10.1186/1475-2875-13-271|pmid=25015559|pmc=4113781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women become susceptible to severe malaria during their first pregnancy.

''P. falciparum'' is found in all continents except Europe. According to the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] ''World Malaria Report 2018'', 219 million people suffered from malaria in 2017, an increase from 216 million in 2016. 435,000 people died from it. The infection is most prevalent in Africa, where 92% of malaria deaths occr. Children under five years of age are most affected and 61% of malaria deaths occurred in this age group. 80% of the infection is found in Sub-Saharan Africa, 7% in the South-East Asia, and 2% in the Eastern Mediterranean. Nigeria has the highest incidence with 27% of the total global cases. Outside Africa, India has the highest incidence with 4.5% of the global burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Malaria Report 2017|date=2017|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=978-92-4-156552-3|pages=32–43, 120–128|url=http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world-malaria-report-2017/report/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe is regarded as a malaria-free region.

===History===
{{See also|History of malaria}}
In 1640, Huan del Vego first employed the [[tincture]] of the [[cinchona]] bark for treating malaria; the native Indians of [[Peru]] and Ecuador had been using it even earlier for treating fevers. Thompson (1650) introduced this "[[Jesuits]]' bark" to [[England]]. Its first recorded use there was by John Metford of [[Northampton]] in 1656. [[Richard Morton (physician)|Morton]] (1696) presented the first detailed description of the clinical picture of malaria and of its treatment with cinchona. [[Gize]] (1816) studied the extraction of crystalline [[quinine]] from the cinchona bark and [[Pierre Joseph Pelletier|Pelletier]] and [[Joseph Bienaimé Caventou|Caventou]] (1820) in [[France]] extracted pure quinine [[alkaloid]]s, which they named quinine and [[cinchonine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenwood|first1=David|title=The quinine connection|journal=Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy|date=1992|volume=30|issue=4|pages=417–427|doi=10.1093/jac/30.4.417|pmid=1490916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaufman|first1=Teodoro S.|last2=Rúveda|first2=Edmundo A.|title=The Quest for Quinine: Those Who Won the Battles and Those Who Won the War|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|date=28 January 2005|volume=44|issue=6|pages=854–885|doi=10.1002/anie.200400663|pmid=15669029}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total synthesis of quinine was achieved by American chemists R.B. Woodward and W.E. Doering in 1944. Woodward received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Todd|first1=L.|last2=Cornforth|first2=J.|last3=T.|first3=A. R.|last4=C.|first4=J. W.|title=Robert Burns Woodward. 10 April 1917-8 July 1979|journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|date=1981|volume=27|issue=|pages=628–695|doi=10.1098/rsbm.1981.0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to make synthetic antimalarials began in 1891. [[Quinacrine|Atabrine]], developed in 1933, was used widely throughout the Pacific in World War II, but was unpopular because of its adeverse effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bispham|first1=W. N.|title=Toxic Reactions Following the Use of Atabrine in Malaria 1|journal=The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|date=1941|volume=s1-21|issue=3|pages=455–459|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.1941.s1-21.455}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1930s, the Germans developed [[chloroquine]], which went into use in the North African campaigns. Creating a secret military project called [[Project 523]], [[Mao Zedong]] encouraged Chinese scientists to find new antimalarials after seeing the casualties in the Vietnam War. [[Tu Youyou]] discovered [[artemisinin]] in the 1970s from sweet wormwood (''[[Artemisia annua]]''). This drug became known to Western scientists in the late 1980s and early 1990s and is now a standard treatment. Tu won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Su|first1=Xin-Zhuan|last2=Miller|first2=Louis H.|title=The discovery of artemisinin and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|journal=Science China Life Sciences|date=2015|volume=58|issue=11|pages=1175–1179|doi=10.1007/s11427-015-4948-7|pmid=26481135|pmc=4966551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uncomplicated malaria ===
According to WHO guidelines 2010,&lt;ref name=who2010&gt;[http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/atoz/9789241547925/en/index.html Guidelines for the treatment of malaria, second edition] Authors: WHO. Number of pages: 194. Publication date: 2010. Languages: English. {{ISBN|978-92-4-154792-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[artemisinin-based combination therapies]] (ACTs) are the recommended [[first-line therapy|first-line]] [[antimalarial]] treatments for uncomplicated malaria caused by ''P. falciparum''. WHO recommends combinations such as [[artemether/lumefantrine]], [[artesunate/amodiaquine]], [[artesunate/mefloquine]], [[artesunate/sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine]], and [[dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine]].&lt;ref name=who2010/&gt;

The choice of ACT is based on the level of resistance to the constituents in the combination. Artemisinin and its derivatives are not appropriate for monotherapy. As second-line antimalarial treatment, when initial treatment does not work, an alternative ACT known to be effective in the region is recommended, such as artesunate plus tetracycline or [[doxycycline]] or [[clindamycin]], and [[quinine]] plus tetracycline or doxycycline or clindamycin. Any of these combinations is to be given for 7 days. For pregnant women, the recommended first-line treatment during the [[first trimester]] is quinine plus clindamycin for 7 days.&lt;ref name=who2010/&gt; Artesunate plus clindamycin for 7 days is indicated if this treatment fails. For travellers returning to nonendemic countries, [[atovaquone]]/[[proguanil]], artemether/lumefantrineany and quinine plus doxycycline or clindamycin are recommended.&lt;ref name=who2010/&gt;

=== Severe malaria ===
For adults, [[intravenous]] (IV) or [[intramuscular]] (IM) artesunate is recommended.&lt;ref name=who2010/&gt; Quinine is an acceptable alternative if parenteral artesunate is not available.&lt;ref name=who2010/&gt;

For children, especially in the malaria-endemic areas of Africa, artesunate IV or IM, quinine (IV infusion or divided IM injection), and artemether IM are recommended.&lt;ref name=who2010/&gt;

Parenteral antimalarials should be administered for a minimum of 24 hours, irrespective of the patient's ability to tolerate oral medication earlier.&lt;ref name=who2010/&gt; Thereafter, complete treatment is recommended including complete course of ACT or quinine plus clindamycin or doxycycline.&lt;ref name=who2010/&gt;

=== Vaccination ===
{{Main|Malaria vaccine}}

[[RTS,S]] is the only candidate as malaria vaccine to have gone through clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matuschewski|first1=Kai|title=Vaccines against malaria-still a long way to go|journal=The FEBS Journal|date=2017|volume=Online|pages=S0264-410X(16)30982–3|doi=10.1111/febs.14107|pmid=28500775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of the results of the phase III trial (conducted between 2011 and 2016) revealed a rather low efficacy (20-39% depending on age, with up to 50% in 5–17-month aged babies), indicating that the vaccine will not lead to full protection and eradication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahmoudi|first1=Shima|last2=Keshavarz|first2=Hossein|title=Efficacy of phase 3 trial of RTS, S/AS01 malaria vaccine: The need for an alternative development plan|journal=Human Vaccines &amp; Immunotherapeutics|date=2017|volume=13|issue=9|pages=2098–2101|doi=10.1080/21645515.2017.1295906|pmid=28272979|pmc=5612527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancer==

The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) has classified malaria due to ''P. falciparum'' as Group 2A carcinogen, meaning that the parasite is probably a cancer-causing agent in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Flora|first1=S|last2=La Maestra|first2=S|title=Epidemiology of cancers of infectious origin and prevention strategies|journal=Journal of Preventive Medicine and Hygiene|date=2015|volume=56|issue=1|pages=E15-20|doi=10.15167/2421-4248/jpmh2015.56.1.470|pmid=26789827|pmc=4718340}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its association with a blood cell ([[lymphocyte]]) cancer called [[Burkitt's lymphoma]] is established. Burkit's lymphoma was discovered by [[Denis Parsons Burkitt|Denis Burkitt]] in 1958 from African children, and he later speculated that the cancer was likely due to certain infectious diseases. In 1964, a virus, later called [[Epstein–Barr virus|Eppstein-Barr virus]] (EBV) after the discoverers, was identified from the cancer cells. The virus was subsequently proved to be the direct cancer agent, and is now classified as [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1 carcinogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bouvard|first1=Véronique|last2=Baan|first2=Robert|last3=Straif|first3=Kurt|last4=Grosse|first4=Yann|last5=Secretan|first5=Béatrice|last6=Ghissassi|first6=Fatiha El|last7=Benbrahim-Tallaa|first7=Lamia|last8=Guha|first8=Neela|last9=Freeman|first9=Crystal|last10=Galichet|first10=Laurent|last11=Cogliano|first11=Vincent|title=A review of human carcinogens—Part B: biological agents|journal=The Lancet Oncology|date=2009|volume=10|issue=4|pages=321–322|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70096-8|pmid=19350698|display-authors=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, it was realised that EBV requires other infections such as with malaria to cause lymphocyte transformation. It was reported that the incidence of Burkitt's lymphoma decreased with effective treatment of malaria over several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geser|first1=A.|last2=Brubaker|first2=G.|last3=Draper|first3=C.C.|title=Effect of a malaria suppression program on the incidence of African Burkitt's lymphoma|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=1989|volume=129|issue=4|pages=740–752|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a115189|pmid=2923122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual role played by ''P. falciparum'' remained unclear for the next two-and-half decades. EBV had been known to induce lymphocytes to become cancerous using its viral proteins (antigens such as [[EBNA-1]], [[EBNA-2]], [[LMP-1]], and [[Epstein–Barr virus latent membrane protein 2|LMP2A]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rajcani|first1=Julius|last2=Szenthe|first2=Kalman|last3=Banati|first3=Ferenc|last4=Szathmary|first4=Susan|title=Survey of Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) Immunogenic Proteins and their Epitopes: Implications for Vaccine Preparation|journal=Recent Patents on Anti-Infective Drug Discovery|date=2014|volume=9|issue=1|pages=62–76|doi=10.2174/1574891X09666140828114812|pmid=25164057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Yuyan|last2=Banerjee|first2=Shuvomoy|last3=Ding|first3=Ling|last4=Cai|first4=Cankun|last5=Wei|first5=Fang|last6=Cai|first6=Qiliang|title=The regulatory role of protein phosphorylation in human gammaherpesvirus associated cancers|journal=Virologica Sinica|date=2017|volume=32|issue=5|pages=357–368|doi=10.1007/s12250-017-4081-9|pmid=29116588}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2014, it became clear that ''P. falciparum'' contributes to the development of the lymphoma. ''P. falciparum''-infected erythrocytes directly bind to [[B lymphocytes]] through the CIDR1α domain of PfEMP1. This binding activates [[toll-like receptors]] ([[TLR7]] and [[TLR10]]) causing continuous activation of lymphocytes to undergo proliferation and differentiation into [[plasma cells]], thereby increasing the secretion of [[IgM]] and [[cytokines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Tong|first1=Hoang|last2=Brindley|first2=Paul J.|last3=Meyer|first3=Christian G.|last4=Velavan|first4=Thirumalaisamy P.|title=Parasite Infection, Carcinogenesis and Human Malignancy|journal=EBioMedicine|date=2017|volume=15|pages=12–23|doi=10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.11.034|pmid=27956028|pmc=5233816}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This in turn activates an enzyme called [[activation-induced cytidine deaminase]] (AID), which tends to cause mutation in the DNA (by [[double-strand break]]) of an EBV-infected lymphocytes. The damaged DNA undergoes uncontrolled [[DNA replication|replication]], thus making the cell cancerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thorley-Lawson|first1=David|last2=Deitsch|first2=Kirk W.|last3=Duca|first3=Karen A.|last4=Torgbor|first4=Charles|last5=Knoll|first5=Laura J|title=The Link between ''Plasmodium falciparum'' Malaria and Endemic Burkitt’s Lymphoma—New Insight into a 50-Year-Old Enigma|journal=PLOS Pathogens|date=2016|volume=12|issue=1|pages=e1005331|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1005331|pmid=26794909|pmc=4721646}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence on the human genome ==
{{further|Genetic resistance to malaria}}
The high [[death|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] caused by ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' has placed great [[Selection (biology)|selective pressure]] on the [[human genome]]. Several genetic factors provide [[genetic resistance to malaria|some resistance to ''Plasmodium'' infection]], including [[sickle cell trait]], [[thalassaemia]] traits, [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], and the absence of [[Duffy antigen]]s on red blood cells.&lt;ref name="Kwiatkowski 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Kwiatkowski DP |title=How malaria has affected the human genome and what human genetics can teach us about malaria |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=171–92 |year=2005 |pmid=16001361 |pmc=1224522 |doi=10.1086/432519}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hedrick 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Hedrick PW |title=Population genetics of malaria resistance in humans |journal=Heredity |year=2011 |volume=107 |issue=4 |pages=283–304 |pmid=21427751 |doi=10.1038/hdy.2011.16 |pmc=3182497}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of ''P. falciparum'' in human populations has exerted [[selective pressure]] on the human genome. E. A.

Excessive amounts of stress, however, may lead to bodily harm. Stress can increase the risk of [[stroke]]s, [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]s, [[ulcer]]s, and [[mental illness]]es such as depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Sapolsky|first1= Robert M.|authorlink= Robert Sapolsky|title= Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers|date= 2004|publisher= St. Martins Press|location= 175 Fifth Ave, New York, N.Y.|isbn= 978-0-8050-7369-0|pages= 37, 71, 92, 271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans experience stress, or perceive things as threatening, when they do not believe that their resources for coping with obstacles (stimuli, people, situations, etc.) are enough for what the circumstances demand. When people think the demands being placed on them exceed their ability to cope, they then perceive stress.&lt;ref name="Folkman, S. 2013"&gt;

==Popular conflation of types==
A very much overlooked side of stress is its positive adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gibbons|first= C.|date= 2012 |title= Stress, positive psychology and the National Student Survey |journal= Psychology Teaching Review |volume= 18|issue=2 |pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive psychological stress can lead to motivation and challenge instead of anxiety. The effects of experiencing [[eustress]], which is positive stress, versus [[Distress (medicine)|distress]], which is negative stress, are significant. While colloquially lumped together, the various types of stress should be treated as separate concepts.

==Variations==
Selye proposed that there are four variations of stress.&lt;ref name= Selye&gt;{{cite book|last=Selye|first=Hans|title=Stress without distress|year=1974|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Company|location=Philadelphia|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On one axis, there is good stress ([[eustress]]) and bad stress ([[Distress (medicine)|distress]]). On the other is over-stress (hyperstress) and understress (hypostress).  The goal is to balance these as much as possible. The ultimate goal would be to balance hyperstress and hypostress perfectly and have as much eustress as possible.&lt;ref name = "Selye 1983"&gt;{{cite book |last= Selye|first=Hans |date=1983 |title=Stress Research Issues for the Eighties |chapter=The Stress Concept: Past, Present and Future|editor-last = Cooper|editor-first=C. L. |location= New York, NY|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is extremely useful for a productive lifestyle because it makes working enjoyable instead of a chore, as seen with distress.

==Differentiation between eustress and distress==
[[Eustress]] comes from the Greek root “eu” which means good as in euphoria.&lt;ref name = "Selye 1975"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Selye |first=Hans |date= 1975|title= Implications of Stress Concept|journal=New York State Journal of Medicine|volume=75 |pages=2139–2145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eustress is when a person perceives a stressor as positive.&lt;ref name=Fevre&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fevre|first=Mark Le|author2=Kolt, Gregory S. |author3=Matheny, Jonathan |title=Eustress, distress and their interpretation in primary and secondary occupational stress management interventions: which way first?|journal=Journal of Managerial Psychology|date=1 January 2006|volume=21|issue=6|pages=547–565|doi=10.1108/02683940610684391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distress stems from the Latin root “dis” as in dissonance or disagreement.&lt;ref name = "Selye 1975"/&gt; Distress is a threat to the quality of life. It is when a demand vastly exceeds a person’s capabilities.&lt;ref name= Fevre /&gt;

There is likely a connection between stress and illness.&lt;ref name="Folkman, S. 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Simandan2010/&gt; Theories of the stress–illness link suggest that both [[Acute stress reaction|acute]] and chronic stress can cause illness, and several studies found such a link.&lt;ref name="Schneiderman, N. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneiderman | first1 = N. | last2 = Ironson | first2 = G. | last3 = Siegel | first3 = S.

Chronic stress and a lack of coping resources available or used by an individual can often lead to the development of psychological issues such as [[major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]] (see below for further information).&lt;ref&gt;Schlotz W, Yim IS, Zoccola PM, Jansen L, Schulz P (2011). The perceived stress reactivity scale: Measurement invariance, stability, and validity in three countries. Psychol Assess. (pp. 80–94).&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly true regarding chronic stressors. These are stressors that may not be as intense as an acute stressor like a natural disaster or a major accident, but they persist over longer periods of time. These types of stressors tend to have a more negative impact on health because they are sustained and thus require the body's physiological response to occur daily. This depletes the body's energy more quickly and usually occurs over long periods of time, especially when these microstressors cannot be avoided (i.e. stress of living in a dangerous neighborhood). See [[allostatic load]] for further discussion of the biological process by which chronic stress may affect the body. For example, studies have found that caregivers, particularly those of dementia patients, have higher levels of depression and slightly worse physical health than noncaregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0882-7974.18.2.250 |pmid=12825775 |title=Differences between caregivers and noncaregivers in psychological health and physical health: A meta-analysis |journal=Psychology and Aging |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=250–67 |year=2003 |last1=Pinquart |first1=Martin |last2=Sörensen |first2=Silvia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have also shown that perceived chronic stress and the hostility associated with [[Type A personality|Type A personalities]] are often associated with much higher risks of cardiovascular disease. This occurs because of the compromised immune system as well as the high levels of arousal in the sympathetic nervous system that occur as part of the body's physiological response to stressful events.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret E. Kemeny, "The Psychobiology of Stress" in Current Directions in Psychological Science Vol. 12, No. 4 (Aug., 2003), pp. 124–129.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible for individuals to exhibit [[hardiness (psychological)|hardiness]]{{snd}} a term referring to the ability to be both chronically stressed and healthy.&lt;ref&gt;Kobasa, S.

It has long been believed that negative affective states, such as feelings of anxiety and depression, could influence the pathogenesis of physical disease, which in turn, have direct effects on biological process that could result in increased risk of disease in the end. However, studies done by the University of Wisconsin-Madison and other places have shown this to be partly untrue; although stress seems to increase the risk of reported poor health, the ''perception'' that stress is harmful increases the risk even further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0026743 |pmid=22201278 |pmc=3374921 |title=Does the perception that stress affects health matter?

Chronic stress results from stressful events that persist over a relatively long period of time, such as caring for a spouse with dementia, or results from brief focal events that continue to be experienced as overwhelming even long after they are over, such as experiencing a sexual assault.

Experiments show that when healthy human individuals are exposed to acute laboratory stressors, they show an adaptive enhancement of some markers of natural immunity but a general suppression of functions of specific immunity. By comparison, when healthy human individuals are exposed to real-life chronic stress, this stress is associated with a biphasic immune response where partial suppression of cellular and humoral function coincides with low-grade, nonspecific inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.natap.org/2007/HIV/101107_02.htm|title=Psychological Stress and Disease (HIV/AIDS)|website=www.natap.org|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though psychological stress is often connected with illness or disease, most healthy individuals can still remain disease-free after confronting chronic stressful events. Also, people who do not believe that stress will affect their health do not have an increased risk of illness, disease, or death.&lt;ref name="blog.ted.com"/&gt; This suggests that there are individual differences in vulnerability to the potential pathogenic effects of stress; individual differences in vulnerability arise due to both genetic and psychological factors. In addition, the age at which the stress is experienced can dictate its effect on health. Research suggests chronic stress at a young age can have lifelong impacts on the biological, psychological, and behavioral responses to stress later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163551 |pmid=19035829 |title=Health Psychology: Developing Biologically Plausible Models Linking the Social World and Physical Health |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=60 |pages=501–24 |year=2009 |last1=Miller |first1=Gregory |last2=Chen |first2=Edith |last3=Cole |first3=Steve W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stress has a physical effect on the body, some individuals may not distinguish this from other more serious illnesses.
If the symptom is unambiguous (e.g. a breast lump), individuals are motivated to seek care regardless if they are under stress.
However, if the symptom is ambiguous (e.g. [[headache]]), they will not seek care attributing the symptom to stress if the stressor's onset is recent which began in the previous 3 weeks, and will seek care if the onset is not recent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7732157 |year=1995 |author1=Cameron |first1=L |title=Seeking medical care in response to symptoms and life stress |journal=Psychosomatic medicine |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=37–47 |last2=Leventhal |first2=E. A |last3=Leventhal |first3=H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
In animals, stress contributes to the initiation, growth, and metastasis of select tumors, but studies that try to link stress and cancer incidence in humans have had mixed results. This can be due to practical difficulties in designing and implementing adequate studies.&lt;ref name = Cohen2007/&gt; Personal belief in stress as a risk factor for cancer was common in one [[UK]] study, though awareness of risk factors overall was found to be low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shahab |first1=Lion |last2=McGowan |first2=Jennifer A. |last3=Waller |first3=Jo |last4=Smith |first4=Samuel G. |title=Prevalence of beliefs about actual and mythical causes of cancer and their association with socio-demographic and health-related characteristics: Findings from a cross-sectional survey in England |journal=European Journal of Cancer |date=April 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2018.03.029 |url=https://www.ejcancer.com/article/S0959-8049(18)30778-0/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neutral stressors==
Stress is a non-specific response.&lt;ref name = "Selye 1983"/&gt; It is neutral, and what varies is the degree of response. It is all about the context of the individual and how they perceive the situation. Selye defined stress as “the nonspecific (that is, common) result of any demand upon the body, be the effect mental or somatic.”&lt;ref name = "Selye 1983"/&gt; This includes the medical definition of stress as a physical demand and the colloquial definition of stress as a psychological demand. A stressor is inherently neutral meaning that the same stressor can cause either distress or eustress. It is individual differences and responses that induce either distress or eustress.&lt;ref name = "HNC"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hargrove |first=M. B. |last2= Nelson|first2=D.

==Types of stressors==
A [[stressor]] is any event, experience, or environmental stimulus that causes stress in an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=stressor |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/stressor |publisher=Collins English Dictionary{{snd}} Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition.

Researchers have found that stressors can make individuals more prone to both physical and psychological problems, including [[heart disease]] and [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name="pastorino"&gt;Pastorino, E. &amp; Doyle-Portillo, S. (2009). What is Psychology?. 2nd Ed. Belmont, CA: Thompson Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stressors are more likely to affect an individual's health when they are "chronic, highly disruptive, or perceived as uncontrollable".&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; In [[psychology]], researchers generally classify the different types of stressors into four categories: 1) crises/catastrophes, 2) major life events, 3) daily hassles/microstressors, and 4) ambient stressors.

===Crises/catastrophes===
This type of stressor is unforeseen and unpredictable and, as such, is completely out of the control of the individual.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; Examples of [[crises]] and catastrophes include: devastating [[natural disaster]]s, such as major [[flood]]s or [[earthquake]]s, [[war]]s, etc. Though rare in occurrence, this type of stressor typically causes a great deal of stress in a person's life.  A study conducted by Stanford University found that after natural disasters, those affected experienced a significant increase in stress level.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; Combat stress is a widespread acute and chronic problem. With the rapid pace and the urgency of firing first, tragic episodes of accidentally killing friendly forces (“brother” killing “brother” or fratricide) may happen. Prevention requires stress reduction, emphasis on vehicle and other identification training, awareness of the tactical situation, and continual risk analysis by leaders at all echelons.&lt;ref&gt;Headquarters, Department of the Army (1994). Leader’s Manual for Combat Stress Control, FM 22–51, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major life events===
Common examples of major life events include: [[marriage]], going to [[college]], [[death]] of a loved one, [[birth]] of a child, moving houses, etc. These events, either positive or negative, can create a sense of uncertainty and fear, which will ultimately lead to stress. For instance, research has found the elevation of stress during the transition from high school to university, with college freshmen being about two times more likely to be stressed than final year students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Teo |first1=Loo Yee |first2=Jia Yuin |last2=Fam |title=Prevalence and determinants of perceived stress among undergraduate students in a Malaysian University |journal=Journal of Health and Translational Medicine |volume=21 |issue=1 |year=2018 |pages=1–5 |url=https://mjes.um.edu.my/index.php/jummec/article/view/11016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has found major life events are somewhat rare to be major causes of stress, due to its rare occurrences.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt;

The length of time since occurrence and whether or not it is a positive or negative event are factors in whether or not it causes stress and how much stress it causes. Researchers have found that events that have occurred within the past month generally are not linked to stress or illness, while chronic events that occurred more than several months ago are linked to stress and illness&lt;ref name=pmid9619470&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0278-6133.17.3.214 |pmid=9619470 |title=Types of stressors that increase susceptibility to the common cold in healthy adults |journal=Health Psychology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=214–23 |year=1998 |last1=Cohen |first1=Sheldon |last2=Frank |first2=Ellen |last3=Doyle |first3=William J |last4=Skoner |first4=David P |last5=Rabin |first5=Bruce S |last6=Gwaltney |first6=Jack M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and personality change.&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014" /&gt; Additionally, positive life events are typically not linked to stress{{snd}} and if so, generally only trivial stress{{snd}} while negative life events can be linked to stress and the health problems that accompany it.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; However, positive experiences and positive life changes can predict decreases in neuroticism.&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2013"/&gt;

===Daily hassles/microstressors===
This category includes daily [[annoyance]]s and minor hassles.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; Examples include: making decisions, meeting deadlines at work or school, traffic jams, encounters with irritating personalities, etc. Often, this type of stressor includes [[:wikt:conflict|conflict]]s with other people. Daily stressors, however, are different for each individual, as not everyone perceives a certain event as stressful. For example, most people find public speaking to be stressful, nevertheless, a seasoned politician most likely will not.

Daily hassles are the most frequently occurring type of stressor in most adults. The high frequency of hassles causes this stressor to have the most physiological effect on an individual. Carolyn Aldwin, Ph.D., conducted a study at the Oregon State University that examined the perceived intensity of daily hassles on an individual's mortality. Aldwin's study concluded that there is a strong correlation between individuals who rate their hassles as very intense and a high level of mortality. One's perception of his/her daily stressors can have a modulating effect on the physiological impact of daily stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.exger.2014.06.019 |pmid=24995936 |pmc=4253863 |title=Do hassles mediate between life events and mortality in older men? |journal=Experimental Gerontology |volume=59 |pages=74–80 |year=2014 |last1=Aldwin |first1=Carolyn M |last2=Jeong |first2=Yu-Jin |last3=Igarashi |first3=Heidi |last4=Choun |first4=Soyoung |last5=Spiro |first5=Avron }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three major psychological types of conflicts that can cause stress.

* The approach-approach conflict, occurs when a person is choosing between two equally attractive options, i.e. whether to go see a movie or to go see a concert.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt;
* The avoidance-avoidance conflict, occurs where a person has to choose between two equally unattractive options, for example, to take out a second loan with unappealing terms to pay off the mortgage or to face foreclosure on one's house.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt;
* The approach-avoidance conflict,&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; occurs when a person is forced to choose whether or not to partake in something that has both attractive and unattractive traits{{snd}} such as whether or not to attend an expensive college (meaning taking out loans now, but also meaning a quality education and employment after graduation).

Travel-related stress results from three main categories: lost time, surprises (an unforeseen event such as lost or delayed baggage) and routine breakers (inability to maintain daily habits).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CWT rolls out solution to tackle cost of travel stress|url=http://www.ttgmice.com/article/cwt-rolls-out-solution-to-tackle-cost-of-travel-stress/|publisher=TTGmice|accessdate=29 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110182351/http://www.ttgmice.com/article/cwt-rolls-out-solution-to-tackle-cost-of-travel-stress/|archivedate=10 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambient stressors===
As their name implies, these are global (as opposed to individual) low-grade stressors that are a part of the background environment.  They are defined as stressors that are "chronic, negatively valued, non-urgent, physically perceptible, and intractable to the efforts of individuals to change them".&lt;ref name=campbell&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0013916583153005 |title=Ambient Stressors |journal=Environment and Behavior |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=355–80 |year=2016 |last1=Campbell |first1=Joan M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples of ambient stressors are pollution, noise, crowding, and traffic.  Unlike the other three types of stressor, ambient stressors can (but do not necessarily have to) negatively impact stress without conscious awareness.  They are thus low on what Stokols called "perceptual salience".{{Non sequitur |date=September 2008| reason = Mentioned neither the author nor the concept before. Maybe just drop the sentence.}}&lt;ref name = campbell/&gt;

===Organizational stressors===
Studies conducted in military and combat fields show that some of the most potent stressors can be due to personal organizational problems in the unit or on the home front.&lt;ref&gt;Headquarters, Department of the Army (2006). Combat and Operational Stress Control, FM 4-02.51, Washington, DC, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Stress due to bad organizational practices is often connected to "Toxic Leadership", both in companies and in governmental organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Whicker, Marcia Lynn.

==Management==
{{redirects|Stress Relief|The Office episode|Stress Relief (The Office)}}
{{redirects|Stress Reliever|the track|R.E.D. (Ne-Yo album)}}
[[Stress management]] refers to a wide spectrum of techniques and psychotherapies aimed at controlling a person's levels of stress, especially chronic stress, usually for the purpose of improving everyday functioning. It involves controlling and reducing the tension that occurs in stressful situations by making emotional and physical changes.

===Prevention and resilience building===
Decreasing stressful behaviors is a part of prevention, some of the common strategies and techniques are: Self-monitoring, tailoring, material reinforcement, social reinforcement, social support, self-contracting, contracting with significant other, shaping, reminders, self-help groups, professional help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Greenberg|title=Comprehensive Stress Management 10E|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6Xr2waR9UEC&amp;pg=PA261|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-067104-1|pages=261–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218174937/https://books.google.com/books?id=D6Xr2waR9UEC&amp;pg=PA261|archivedate=2017-02-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain |date=September 2018| reason = Some of these terms are probably unclear to the non-experts.}}

Although many techniques have traditionally been developed to deal with the consequences of stress considerable research has also been conducted on the prevention of stress, a subject closely related to [[Psychological resilience|psychological resilience-building]].  A number of self-help approaches to stress-prevention and resilience-building have been developed, drawing mainly on the theory and practice of cognitive-behavioral therapy.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2012"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Robertson, D | title=Build your Resilience| year=2012| publisher=Hodder| location=London| isbn=978-1-4441-6871-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwIstsEgkBMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biofeedback]] may also play a role in stress management. A randomized study by Sutarto et al. assessed the effect of resonant breathing biofeedback (recognize and control involuntary heart rate variability) among manufacturing operators; depression, anxiety and stress significantly decreased.&lt;ref name="Sutarto2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10803548.2012.11076959 |pmid=23294659 |title=Resonant Breathing Biofeedback Training for Stress Reduction Among Manufacturing Operators |journal=International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=549–61 |year=2015 |last1=Purwandini Sutarto |first1=Auditya |last2=Abdul Wahab |first2=Muhammad Nubli |last3=Mat Zin |first3=Nora }}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coping mechanisms===
{{Main|Coping (psychology)}}
The Lazarus and Folkman model suggests that external events create a form of pressure to achieve, engage in, or experience a stressful situation. Stress is not the external event itself, but rather an interpretation and response to the potential threat; this is when the coping process begins.&lt;ref name="Coping With Stress"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=C.R.|last2=Lefcourt|first2=Herbert M.|title=Coping With Stress|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University|location=New York|pages=68–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various ways individuals deal with perceived threats that may be stressful. However, people have a tendency to respond to threats with a predominant coping style, in which they dismiss feelings, or manipulate the stressful situation.&lt;ref name="Coping With Stress"/&gt;

There are different classifications for coping, or [[defense mechanisms]], however they all are variations on the same general idea: There are good/productive and negative/counterproductive ways to handle stress. Because stress is perceived, the following mechanisms do not necessarily deal with the actual situation that is causing an individual stress. However, they may be considered coping mechanisms if they allow the individual to cope better with the negative feelings/anxiety that they are experiencing due to the perceived stressful situation, as opposed to actually fixing the concrete obstacle causing the stress. The following mechanisms are adapted from the DSM-IV Adaptive Functioning Scale, APA, 1994.

====Highly adaptive/active/problem-focused mechanisms====
These skills are what one could call as “facing the problem head on”, or at least dealing with the negative emotions experienced by stress in a constructive manner. (generally adaptive)

* '''Affiliation''' ("[[tend and befriend]]") – involves dealing with stress by turning to a social network for support, but an individual does not share with others in order to diffuse or avoid the responsibility.&lt;ref name="Levo, Lynn M. 2003"&gt;Levo, Lynn M. (2003, September.) Understanding Defense Mechanisms. ''Lukenotes''. 7(4). St. Luke Institute, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DSM-IV Adaptive Functioning Scale 1994"&gt;Adapted from DSM-IV Adaptive Functioning Scale, APA, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Humor]]''' – the individual steps outside of a situation in order to gain greater perspective, and also to highlight any comic aspect to be found in their stressful circumstances.&lt;ref name="Levo, Lynn M. 2003"/&gt;
[[File:Two people laughing.jpg|thumb|Coping through laughter]]
::“The Association for Applied and Therapeutic Humor defines therapeutic humor as ‘any intervention that promotes health and wellness by stimulating a playful discovery, expression or appreciation of the absurdity of or incongruity of life’s situations. This intervention may enhance health or be used as a complementary treatment of illness to facilitate healing or coping whether physical, emotional, cognitive, or spiritual”.&lt;ref name="Communication in Nursing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riley|first1=Julia|title=Communication in Nursing|date=2012|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Missouri|pages=160–173|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::[[Sigmund Freud]], a well known neurologist, suggests the humor was an excellent defensive strategy in emotional situations.&lt;ref name="Coping With Stress"/&gt; When one laughs during a tough situation they feel absent from their worries, and this allows them to think differently.&lt;ref name="Communication in Nursing"/&gt; When one experiences a different mind set, they feel more in control of their response, and how they will go about dealing with the event that caused stress.

::Lefcourt (2001) suggests that this perspective-taking humor is the most effective due to its ability to distance oneself from the situation of great stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lefcourt|first1=H. M.|editor1-last=Snyder|editor1-first=C. R.|title=Coping with Stress: Effective People and Processes.|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0198029950|pages=68–92|chapter=The Humor Solution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that the use of laughter and humor creates a sense of relief of stress that can last up to 45 minutes post-laughter&lt;ref name="Communication in Nursing"/&gt;.

::Also, most hospitalized children have been seen to use laughter and play to relieve their fear, pain and stress. It has been discovered that there is a great importance in the use of laughter and humor in stress coping.&lt;ref name="Communication in Nursing"/&gt; Humans should use humor as a means to transcend their original understanding of an external event, take a different perspective, in which their anxiety may be minimized by.

* '''[[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]]''' – allows an "indirect resolution of conflict with neither adverse consequences nor consequences marked by loss of pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Valliant | first1 = George E. | year = 2000 | title = Adaptive Mental Mechanisms | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 89–98 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.55.1.89| pmid = 11392869 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, this mechanism allows channeling of troubling emotions or impulses into an outlet that is socially acceptable.
* '''Positive reappraisal''' – redirects thoughts (cognitive energy) to good things that are either occurring or have not occurred. This can lead to [[personal growth]], [[self-reflection]], and awareness of the power/benefits of one's efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Folkman | first1 = S. | last2 = Moskowitz | first2 = J. | year = 2000 | title = Stress, Positive Emotion, and Coping | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 115–118 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00073}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, studies on [[veteran]]s of war or peacekeeping operations indicate that persons who construe a positive meaning from their combat or threat experiences tend to adjust better than those who do not.&lt;ref name="pmid17532104"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schok ML, Kleber RJ, Elands M, Weerts JM |title=Meaning as a mission: a review of empirical studies on appraisals of war and peacekeeping experiences |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=357–65 |year=2008 |pmid=17532104 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2007.04.005 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final path model fitted well (CF1 = 1, RMSEA = 0.00) and showed that direct quality of life paths with β = -0.2, and indirect social support with β = -0.088 had the most effects on reduction of stress during pregnancy.{{Non sequitur |date=September 2008| reason = Comes out of nowhere.  Phrases require further explanations. Maybe just drop the sentence.}}
Other adaptive coping mechanisms include [[Anticipation (emotion)|anticipation]], [[altruism]], and [[self-observation]].

====Mental inhibition/disavowal mechanisms====
These mechanisms cause the individual to have a diminished (or in some cases non-existent) awareness about their anxiety, threatening ideas, fears, etc., that come from being conscious of the perceived threat.

* '''[[Displacement (psychology)|Displacement]]''' – This is when an individual redirects their emotional feelings about one situation to another, less threatening one.&lt;ref&gt;"displacement n." A Dictionary of Psychology. Edited by Andrew M. Colman. Oxford University Press 2009. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Psychological repression|Repression]]''' – Repression occurs when an individual attempts to remove all their thoughts, feelings, and anything related to the upsetting/stressful (perceived) threat out of their awareness in order to be disconnected from the entire situation. When done long enough in a successful way, this is more than just denial.
* '''[[Reaction formation]]''' – An individual substitutes their feelings or thoughts or behavior with the exact opposite. An attempt to remove any “unacceptable thoughts” from one's consciousness by replacing them with the exact opposite.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/engl/theory/psychoanalysis/definitions/reactionformation.html{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other inhibition coping mechanisms include undoing, [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], [[denial]], [[Psychological projection|projection]], and [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]]. Although some people claim that inhibition coping mechanisms may eventually increase the stress level because the problem is not solved, detaching from the stressor can sometimes help people to temporarily release the stress and become more prepared to deal with problems later on.

====Active mechanisms====
These methods deal with stress by an individual literally taking action, or withdrawing.

* '''[[Acting out]]''' – Often viewed as counter-normative, or problematic behavior. Instead of reflecting or problem-solving, an individual takes maladaptive action.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV Adaptive Functioning Scale 1994"/&gt;
* '''[[Passive aggression]]''' – When an individual indirectly deals with his or her anxiety and negative thoughts/feelings stemming from their stress by acting in a hostile or resentful manner towards others. Help-Rejecting Complaining can also be included in this category.

====Health promotion====
There is an alternative method to coping with stress, in which one works to minimize their anxiety and stress in a preventative manner. If one works towards coping with stress daily, the feeling of stress and the ways in which one deals with it as the external event arises becomes less of a burden.

Suggested strategies to improve stress management include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Potter|first1=Patricia|title=Canadian Fundamentals of Nursing|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier|location=Toronto|pages=472–488|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Regular exercise – set up a fitness program, 3–4 times a week
# Support systems – to listen, offer advice, and support each other
# Time management – develop an organizational system
# Guided imagery and visualization – create a relaxing state of mind
# Progressive muscle relaxation – loosen tense muscle groups
# [[Assertiveness]] training – work on effective communication
# Journal writing – express true emotion, self-reflection
# Stress management in the workplace – organize a new system, switch tasks to reduce own stress.

Depending on the situation, all of these coping mechanisms may be adaptive, or maladaptive.

==Physiological response==

===To stress that affect communication===
The body responds to stress in many ways. Readjusting chemical levels is just one of them. Here are some examples of adjustments and changes that affect communication.

====General adaptive syndrome====
In terms of measuring the body's response to stress, psychologists tend to use Hans Selye's [[General adaptation syndrome#General adaptation syndrome|general adaptation syndrome]]. This model is also often referred to as the classic stress response, and it revolves around the concept of [[homeostasis]]. General adaptive syndrome occurs in three stages:

#'''The alarm reaction'''. This stage occurs when the stressor is first presented. The body begins to gather resources to deal with the stressor. The [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] and [[sympathetic nervous system]] are activated, resulting in the release of hormones from the [[adrenal gland]] such as [[cortisol]], adrenaline ([[epinephrine]]), and [[norepinephrine]] into the bloodstream to adjust bodily processes. These hormonal adjustments increase energy levels, increase muscle tension, reduce sensitivity to pain, slow down the digestive system, and cause a rise in blood pressure.&lt;ref name="GottliebBenjaminCoping"&gt;Gottlieb, Benjamin."Coping with Chronic Stress". Plenum Press. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="General Adaptive Syndrome"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitterer|first1=Jon|last2=Coon|first2=Dennis|title=Introduction to Psychology|date=2013|publisher=Jon-David Hague|pages=446–447}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Locus coeruleus]], a collection of Norepinephrine-containing neurons in the [[pons]] of the [[brainstem]] whose axons project to various regions of the brain, is involved in releasing Norepinephrine directly onto neurons. High levels of Norepinephrine acting as a neurotransmitter on its receptors expressed on neurons in brain regions, such as the [[prefrontal cortex]] is thought to be involved in the effects of stress on [[executive functions]], such as impaired [[working memory]].   
#'''The stage of resistance'''. The body continues building up resistance throughout the stage of resistance, until either the body's resources are depleted, leading to the exhaustion phase, or the stressful stimulus is removed. As the body uses up more and more of its resources people become increasingly tired and susceptible to illness. This stage is where psychosomatic disorders first begin to appear.&lt;ref name="General Adaptive Syndrome" /&gt;
#'''The stage of exhaustion'''. The body is completely drained of the hormones and resources it was depending on to manage the stressor. The person now begins to exhibit behaviors such as anxiety, irritability, avoidance of responsibilities and relationships, self-destructive behavior, and poor judgment. If someone is experiencing these symptoms they have a much greater chance of lashing out, damaging relationships, or avoiding social interaction at all.&lt;ref name="General Adaptive Syndrome" /&gt;

This [[Stress (biology)#Neurochemistry and physiology|physiological stress]] response involves high levels of [[sympathetic nervous system]] activation, often referred to as the "fight or flight" response. The [http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/dce/hhs231_w04/nine/studyguide.htm response] involves pupil dilation, release of endorphins, increased heart and respiration rates, cessation of digestive processes, secretion of adrenaline, arteriole dilation, and constriction of veins. This high level of arousal is often unnecessary to adequately cope with micro-stressors and daily hassles; yet, this is the response pattern seen in humans, which often leads to health issues commonly associated with high levels of stress.&lt;ref name="oregonstate.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/dce/hhs231_w04/nine/studyguide.htm|title=HHS 231 – Extended Campus – Oregon State University|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010135321/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/dce/hhs231_w04/nine/studyguide.htm|archivedate=2012-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quality of sleep====
Sleep allows people to rest and re-energize for another day filled with interactions and tasks. If someone is stressed it is extremely important for them to get enough sleep so that they can think clearly. Unfortunately, chemical changes in the body caused by stress can make sleep a difficult thing. [[Glucocorticoid]]s are released by the body in response to stress which can disrupt sleep. Sleep comes in four stages and the deepest, most restful sleep can only be attained after having been asleep for an hour.&lt;ref name=Sleep&gt;{{cite book|last1=Craven|first1=Ruth|last2=Hirnle|first2=Constance|last3=Jensen|first3=Sharon|title=Fundamentals of Nursing: Human and Health Function|date=2013|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|page=1319|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stressful social experiences that affect communication===
When someone is stressed, many challenges can arise; a recognized challenge being communication difficulties. Here are some examples of how stress can hinder communication.

====Cultural differences: individualistic vs. collectivistic====
The cultures of the world generally fall into two categories; individualistic and collectivistic.&lt;ref name=Sleep /&gt;

* An [[individualistic]] culture, like that of the United States, where everyone is an independent entity defined by their accomplishments and goals.
* A collectivistic culture, like that of many Asian countries, prefers to see individuals as interdependent on each other. They value modesty and family.

These cultural differences can affect how people communicate when they are stressed. For example, a member of an individualistic cultural would be hesitant to ask for pain medication for fear of being perceived as weak. A member of a collectivistic culture would not hesitate. They have been brought up in a cultural where everyone helps each other and is one functional unit whereas the member of the individualistic culture is not as comfortable asking others for aid.&lt;ref name=Sleep/&gt;

====Language barriers====
{{Confusing section |date=September 2018| reason = Do the language barriers cause stress, or does stress add to language barriers?  What is cause, what is effect?  }}
Language barriers can also diminish communication due to stress.&lt;ref name="Cultural Differences"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morrison-Valfre|first1=Michelle|title=Foundations of mental health care|date=2009|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=978-0-323-05644-1|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; All languages have their own way of using names, titles, and just interacting. These differences can make inter lingual communication relatively stressful. Not speaking the same languages, different ways of showing respect, and different use of body language can make things difficult. Being uncomfortable with the communication around a person can discourage them from communicating at all.&lt;ref name="Cultural Differences"/&gt;

====Changes in the home====
Divorce, death, and remarriage are all disruptive events in a household.&lt;ref name=Sleep /&gt; Although everyone involved is affected by events such as these, it can be most drastically seen in children. Due to their age, children have relatively undeveloped coping skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002059.htm|title=Stress in childhood: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason a stressful event may cause some changes in their behavior. Falling in with a new crowd, developing some new and sometimes undesirable habits are just some of the changes stress may trigger in their lives.&lt;ref name=Sleep /&gt;

A particularly interesting response to stress is talking to an [[imaginary friend]]. A child may feel angry with a parent or their peers who they feel brought this change on them. They need someone to talk to but it definitely won’t be the person with whom they are angry. That’s when the imaginary friend comes in. They “talk” to this imaginary friend but in doing so they cut off communication with the real people around them.&lt;ref name=Sleep /&gt;

==Social support and health==
Researchers have long been interested in how an individual's level and types of [[social support]] impact the effect of stress on their health. Studies consistently show that social support can protect against physical and mental consequences of stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Uchino | first1 = B. N. | year = 2009 | title = Understanding the links between social support and physical health: A life-span perspective with emphasis on the separability of perceived and received support | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 236–255 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2009.01122.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berkman | first1 = L.

One model, known as the "direct effects" model, holds that social support has a direct, positive impact on health by increasing positive affect, promoting adaptive health behaviors, predictability and stability in life, and safeguarding against social, legal, and economic concerns that could negatively impact health. another model, the "buffering effect", says that social support exerts greatest influence on health in times of stress, either by helping individuals appraise situations in less threatening manners or coping with the actual stress. Researchers have found evidence to support both these pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = S. | last2 = Wills | first2 = T. A. | year = 1985 | title = Stress, social support, and the buffering hypothesis | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 98 | issue = 2| pages = 310–357 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.98.2.310 | pmid=3901065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social support is defined more specifically as psychological and material resources provided by a social network that are aimed at helping an individual cope with stress.&lt;ref name="Cohen, S. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Social relationships and health | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 59 | issue = 8| pages = 676–684 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.59.8.676 | pmid=15554821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers generally distinguish among several types of social support: instrumental support – which refers to material aid (e.g., financial support or assistance in transportation to a physician's appointment), informational support (e.g., knowledge, education or advice in problem-solving), and emotional support (e.g., empathy,  reassurance, etc.).&lt;ref name="Cohen, S. 2004"/&gt; Social support can reduce the rate of stress during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sara Shishehgar |author2=Abolfazl Mahmoodi |author3=Mahrokh Dolatian |author4=Zohreh Mahmoodi |author5=Maryam Bakhtiary |author6=Hamid Alavi Majd  |last-author-amp=yes |title=The Relationship of Social Support and Quality of Life with the Level of Stress in Pregnant Women Using the PATH Model |journal=Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal |volume=15 |issue=7 |pages=560–5 |year=2013 |pmc=3871742 |doi=10.5812/ircmj.12174 |pmid=24396574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communicating with someone who is stressed==
{{How-to|date=August 2017}}

Social support from friends and the community can be very beneficial to helping someone communicate while stressed. Social support is giving a person the knowledge that they are part of a mutual network of caring, interested others, that enable them to lower levels of stress and be better able to cope with the stress that they undergo.&lt;ref name="Feldman, dinardo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feldman &amp; Dinardo|first1=Robert S., Andrea|title=Essentials of understanding psychology|date=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson|location=Toronto|isbn=9780070974111|edition=3rd Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social and emotional support people provide for each other demonstrates that they are important and valued members of social networks.&lt;ref name="Feldman, dinardo"/&gt;

The stress of a person can greatly affect those around them, especially in families. “Families can experience many conflicting emotions when placed in the position of providing protected care for a loved one. Compassion, protectiveness, and caring can be intermingled with feelings of helplessness and being trapped."&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnold &amp; Boggs|first1=Elizabeth, Kathleen Underman|title=Interpersonal Relationships : Professional Communication Skills For Nurses|date=2011|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9781437709445|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional support is crucial to helping families cope with the challenge of supporting their loved one (stressed person).&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships" /&gt;  This emotional support can be expressed through many communication methods.

In order to be able to effectively communicate with someone who is stressed, it is important to know how to interact with them in a way that can be beneficial for them. Therapeutic communication techniques can help with different types of communication. These techniques include but are not limited to listening, making open-ended comments, reducing distance, restating, seeking clarification, reflecting, and planning.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riley|first1=Julia Balzer|title=Communication in nursing.|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier/Mosby|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9780323083348|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actively listening to someone when they are stressed can help them release frustrations and cope with their problems. Listening shows that you are interested in the person, and can have great therapeutic value. It is important to show that the stressed person's needs are above the caregiver's in order for the interaction to be therapeutic.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt; It is important that you remain prepared mentally, emotionally, and physically to assist him or her. It is favorable to remain punctual and polite in the manner of relating to them, and that the best methods are used to promote their well-being and comfort.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;

===Verbal communication methods===
* Making open-ended comments can allow the person who is stressed to decide the direction that the interaction can take and encourages them to keep talking.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;
* In order to validate that the message is being interpreted properly, it is a good idea to restate what the person has said. Seeking clarification can also help to ensure the understanding of what they’re communicating.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;
* Try reflecting about what the stressed person has said to you. It will show that you see and understand the importance in his or her feelings, ideas and interpretations. It is important to avoid being judgmental, and rejecting what the person has said. It may make them feel that they are personally being rejected.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;
* At the end of the conversation, it is a good idea to help them plan their goals, direction and so forth, of future interactions.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;

===Nonverbal communication methods===
* Having a posture that is slightly leaning towards the person communicates interest and encourages them to keep talking.&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships"/&gt; Reducing physical distance between yourself and the person who is stressed, indicates that you want to be involved in helping the person.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;
* "Try maintaining an open, friendly expression without being boisterously cheerful. Avoid furrowed forehead or a distracted or bored expression."&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships"/&gt; Making direct eye contact also generally conveys that you show interest and concern for them.&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships"/&gt;
* It is very beneficial to generally focus on maintaining an open atmosphere when speaking to someone. However, it is also important to pay attention to their nonverbal cues as well. By using their nonverbal cues, you can interpret their mood and/or feelings. This will help with adapting to the situation and communicating better.&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships"/&gt;

===How to prevent misunderstanding===
Communication is an important stress-management skill. Although this seems like an easy skill, there is much more to communication than simply speaking. In fact, communication can cause problems such as misunderstandings when not used effectively. When miscommunication happen there tends to be more problems, anger and resentment then if communication were effective in the first place. There are certain things that need to be done to achieve effective communication.&lt;ref name= Edelman&gt;{{cite book|last=Edelman, C.L., Kudzma, E.C., Mandle|first=C.L.|title=Health Promotion Throughout the Life Span, Chapter 13|date=2014|volume=8th edition|pages=310–313|publisher=St. Louis, MO:Elsevier, Mosby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''first guideline'' is to be clear about is what is wanted or needed when speaking with others.

This technique requires the individual’s recognition of distorted and exaggerated expectations and thoughts.

An easy way to meet this guideline is by reflecting the purpose of the conversation in the statement. By reflecting what the desired outcome of the conversation is, there is little room for miscommunication.

The ''second guideline'' for effective communication is to use assertive communication.

An assertive statement is non-judgmental, expresses feelings and opinions and reaffirms perceived rights.&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt;
The best way to use the assertive technique is with manipulating the following formula:

* I feel [emotion], when you [the behavior], because [explanation].

When people are stressed, they cannot verbalize their feelings correctly. When the receiver in the conversation cannot understand the needs of the person, miscommunications happen and the person may feel victimized and blame others for not understanding. The third guideline is empathy which is defined as the ability to consider another person’s perspective and to communicate this perspective back to that person.

The ''final guideline'' to prevent misunderstandings when communicating while stressed is cognitive restructuring which facilitates assertive communication as it requires the person to identify their thoughts and feelings. Some ways to restructure cognitively is by stopping and understanding what the conversation holds.

Breathing deeply as this will release any tension and promote relaxation which will allow you to reflect on the true emotions.

Reflecting on how you feel emotionally and how you feel immediately allow you to choose the right answer.

Choosing the more realistic and helpful way of thinking allows the communication to be straight forward and upfront leaving little room for miscommunication.

By following the above techniques and guidelines, the chance of a miscommunication in a conversation will decrease. Once the ability to communicate with assertive techniques is worked into everyday life, the frequency of misunderstandings will decrease significantly.

The importance of understanding how to communicate assertively is critical for daily life. With the knowledge of how to properly communicate, whether stressed or not, the ability to communicate will become easier and result in less misunderstandings and frustrations which can contribute to one’s stress.&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt;

==Scales==
Life events scales can be used to assess stressful things that people experience in their lives. One such scale is the [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale|Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale]], also known as the Social Readjustment Rating Scale, or SRRS.&lt;ref name="holmes"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holmes | first1 = TH | last2 = Rahe | first2 = RH  | year = 1967 | title = The Social Readjustment Rating Scale | url = | journal = J Psychosom Res | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 213–8 | doi=10.1016/0022-3999(67)90010-4 | pmid=6059863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed by psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe in 1967, the scale lists 43 stressful events.

To calculate one's score, add up the number of "life change units" if an event occurred in the past year. A score of more than 300 means that individual is at risk for illness, a score between 150 and 299 means risk of illness is moderate, and a score under 150 means that individual only has a slight risk of illness.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt;&lt;ref name="holmes" /&gt;

'''Richard Clarke Cabot'''  (May 21, 1868 – May 7, 1939) was an American physician who advanced clinical [[hematology]], was an innovator in teaching methods, and was a pioneer in [[social work]].

==Early life and education==
Richard Clarke Cabot was born May 21, 1868, in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], one of five sons of [[James Elliot Cabot]] and Elizabeth (Dwight) Cabot.&lt;ref name=papers&gt;[http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hua02998 "Cabot, Richard C. (Richard Clarke), 1868-1939. Papers of Richard Clarke Cabot : an inventory,"] Harvard University archives. Accessed Jan. 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; James Cabot was a philosopher and [[Harvard University]] professor who also trained as a lawyer and biographer, and was a friend of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].

==Professional career==
[[Image:Picture of Richard Clarke Cabot.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cabot at work.]]
Cabot studied philosophy at [[Harvard University]] before switching to medicine.  Inspired by the beliefs of [[John Dewey]], Cabot felt more drawn to action than contemplation, and he admired the work of [[Teddy Roosevelt]] and [[Jane Addams]].  After completing his studies in 1892, he turned down the role of the first [[bacteriology|bacteriologist]] at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] to work in the hospital's much less prestigious outpatient department.  At this time, outpatient wards dealt mostly with people who couldn't afford inpatient treatment, or for the treatment of incurable chronic conditions such [[tuberculosis]] or [[diabetes]].  This involved working populations who lived in unhealthy, overcrowded accommodation, often recent migrants.&lt;ref name=gehlert /&gt;

He changed the way that the outpatient department was run, believing that economic, social, family and psychological conditions underpinned many of the conditions that patients presented with.  He envisaged that social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors, the former concentrating on physiological health, and the latter on social health.  In addition to this, he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting.  In 1905 Cabot created one of the first positions of  professional [[Social workers|social worker]] in the world, given to Garnet Pelton, and then to Ida Cannon.&lt;ref&gt;Beder, J. (2006) Hospital Social Work: The interface of medicine and caring.  Routlege: New York&lt;/ref&gt; Although Clarke credited his approach as similar to that of [[Anne Cummins (social worker)|Anne Cummins]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Baraclough, J. (2004-09-23). Cummins, Anne Emily (1869–1936), social worker. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 3 Jan. 2018, see [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-75263 link]&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital refused to support the hiring of social workers, and Cabot had to pay their wages himself.  Pelten developed tuberculosis herself soon after taking up the position and was forced to retire.  Cannon stayed in the position for forty years and became Head of Social Work at the hospital.  Cabot and Cannon pioneered many programs to improve the health of patients, including art classes for psychiatric patients, low-cost meals for patients and research on the social factors that increased a person's likelihood of developing tuberculosis.&lt;ref name=gehlert /&gt;

In 1917 Cabot took up a position in the [[Medical Reserve Corps]] for a year.  He returned briefly to Massachusetts General Hospital in 1918 and then left to take up the position of chair at Harvard's Department of Social Ethics in 1919.  At this time, the hospital agreed to pay the wages of social workers, as up to this point, Cabot had paid the wages of thirteen social workers over the last 12 years.&lt;ref name=gehlert /&gt;  He went on to write about his experiences in his book ''Social Work''&lt;ref&gt;Cabot, R.C. (1919). ''Social Work'', webpage: [https://books.google.com/books?id=acDjrZh_zdsC Google-Books-dsC].&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also credited with discovering [[Cabot rings]], and for describing, along with his colleague, Locke, the [[eponym]]ous Cabot-Locke [[Heart murmur|murmur]], a [[diastolic]] murmur occasionally heard in severe [[anemia]], unrelated to [[heart valve]] abnormalities.

Cabot established a tradition of teaching conferences at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] (MGH) that featured generating [[differential diagnoses]], and founded the long-standing feature of Case Record of MGH in ''New England Journal of Medicine''.

== Family and personal life ==
Cabot's paternal grandfather, [[Samuel Cabot, Jr.]], became a sailor at age 19 and married Elizabeth Perkins, daughter of a successful Boston trader.  [[Samuel Cabot III]] later took over the running of the firm.

Richard married [[Ella Lyman Cabot|Ella Lyman]], and both held [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] views.  This philosophy, as well as his parents' commitment to philanthropy, had a strong influence of Richard.  Around the end of the 19th Century, such ideals were out of favor, with the dominant beliefs at the time being [[social Darwinism]].&lt;ref name=gehlert&gt;Gehlert, S. in Gehlert, S. and T.A.

The '''Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales''' (or more commonly the '''Stanford–Binet''') is an individually administered [[intelligence test]] that was revised from the original Binet–Simon Scale by [[Lewis M. Terman]], a psychologist at Stanford University. The Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale is now in its fifth edition (SB5) and was released in 2003. It is a cognitive ability and [[intelligence]] test that is used to diagnose developmental or intellectual deficiencies in young children. The test measures five weighted factors and consists of both verbal and nonverbal subtests. The five factors being tested are knowledge, quantitative reasoning, visual-spatial processing, [[working memory]], and fluid reasoning.

The development of the Stanford–Binet initiated the modern field of intelligence testing and was one of the first examples of an [[adaptive test]]. The test originated in [[France]], then was revised in the [[United States]]. It was initially created by the French [[psychologist]] [[Alfred Binet]], who, following the introduction of a law mandating [[universal education]] by the [[French government]], began developing a method of identifying "slow" children, so that they could be placed in [[special education]] programs, instead of labelled ''sick'' and sent to the asylum.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas, S., Andrieu, B., Croizet, J.-C., Sanitioso, R.

On the origins of intelligence as a psychological object.] ''Intelligence, 41''(5), 699–711. doi:10.1016/j.intell.2013.08.006 (This is an [[open access]] article, made freely available by [[Elsevier]].)&lt;/ref&gt; As Binet indicated, [[case studies]] might be more detailed and helpful, but the time required to test many people would be excessive. In 1916, at [[Stanford University]], the psychologist Lewis Terman released a revised examination that became known as the ''Stanford–Binet test''.

== Development ==
As discussed by Fancher &amp; Rutherford in 2012, the Stanford–Binet is a modified version of the Binet-Simon Intelligence scale. The Binet-Simon scale was created by the French psychologist [[Alfred Binet]] and his student [[Theodore Simon]]. Due to changing education laws of the time, Binet had been requested by a government commission to come up with a way to detect children with significantly below-average intelligence and mental retardation.

To create their test, Binet and Simon first created a baseline of [[intelligence]]. A wide range of children were tested on a broad spectrum of measures in an effort to discover a clear indicator of intelligence. Failing to find a single identifier of intelligence, Binet and Simon instead compared children in each category by age. The children’s highest levels of achievement were sorted by age and common levels of achievement considered the normal level for that age. Because this testing method merely compares a person's ability to the common ability level of others their age, the general practices of the test can easily be transferred to test different populations, even if the measures used are changed.

Reproduced from the article "A Practical Guide for Administering the Binet-Simon Scale for Measuring Intelligence" by J. W. Wallace Wallin in the March 1911 issue of the journal ''The Psychological Clinic'' (volume 5 number 1), public domain]]

One of the first intelligence tests, the Binet-Simon test quickly gained support in the psychological community, many of whom further spread it to the public. Lewis M. Terman, a [[psychologist]] at [[Stanford University]], was one of the first to create a version of the test for people in the United States, naming the localized version the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale. Terman used the test not only to help identify children with [[Intellectual disability|learning difficulties]] but also to find children and adults who had above average levels of intelligence. In creating his version, Terman also tested additional methods for his Stanford revision, publishing his first official version as The Measurement of Intelligence: An Explanation of and a Complete Guide for the Use of the Stanford Revision and Extension of the Binet-Simon Intelligence Scale (Fancher &amp; Rutherford, 2012) (Becker, 2003).

The original tests in the 1905 form include:

# "Le Regard"
# Prehension Provoked by a Tactile Stimulus
# Prehension Provoked by a Visual Perception
# Recognition of Food
# Quest of Food Complicated by a Slight Mechanical Difficulty

# Definitions of Abstract Terms

=== Historical use ===
One hindrance to widespread understanding of the test is its use of a variety of different measures. In an effort to simplify the information gained from the Binet-Simon test into a more comprehensible and easier to understand form, German psychologist [[William Stern (psychologist)|William Stern]] created the now well known Intelligence Quotient (IQ). By comparing the age a child scored at to their biological age, a ratio is created to show the rate of their mental progress as IQ. Terman quickly grasped the idea for his Stanford revision with the adjustment of multiplying the ratios by 100 to make them easier to read.

As also discussed by Leslie, in 2000, Terman was another of the main forces in spreading intelligence testing in the United States (Becker, 2003). Terman quickly promoted the use of the Stanford–Binet for schools across the United States where it saw a high rate of acceptance. Terman’s work also had the attention of the U.S. government, who recruited him to apply the ideas from his Stanford–Binet test for military recruitment near the start of World War I. With over 1.7 million military recruits taking a version of the test and the acceptance of the test by the government, the Stanford–Binet saw an increase in awareness and acceptance (Fancher &amp; Rutherford, 2012).

Given the perceived importance of intelligence and with new ways to measure intelligence, many influential individuals, including Terman, began promoting controversial ideas to increase the nation's overall intelligence. These ideas included things such as discouraging individuals with low IQ from having children and granting important positions based on high IQ scores. While there was significant opposition, many institutions proceeded to adjust students' education based on their IQ scores, often with a heavy influence on future career possibilities (Leslie, 2000).

==Revisions of the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale==
[[File:Maud Amanda Merrill (1888-1985).jpg|thumb|Maud Merrill]]
Since the first publication in 1916, there have been four additional revised editions of the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales, the first of which was developed by Lewis Terman. Over twenty years later, [[Maud Merrill]] was accepted into Stanford’s education program shortly before Terman became the head of the psychology department. She completed both her [[Masters Degree]] and Ph.D. under Terman and quickly became a colleague of his as they started the revisions of the second edition together. There were 3,200 examinees, aged one and a half to eighteen years, ranging in different geographic regions as well as socioeconomic levels in attempts to comprise a broader normative sample (Roid &amp; Barram, 2004). This edition incorporated more objectified scoring methods, while placing less emphasis on recall memory and including a greater range of nonverbal abilities (Roid &amp; Barram, 2004) compared to the 1916 edition.

When Terman died in 1956, the revisions for the third edition were well underway, and Merrill was able to publish the final revision in 1960 (Roid &amp; Barram, 2004). The use of the deviation IQ made its first appearance in this third edition by replacing the ratio IQ. While new features were added, there were no newly created items included in this revision. Instead, any items from the 1937 form that showed no substantial change in difficulty from the 1930s to the 1950s were either eliminated or adjusted (Roid &amp; Barram, 2004).

Robert Thorndike was asked to take over after Merrill’s retirement. With the help of Elizabeth Hagen and [[Jerome Sattler]], Thorndike produced the fourth edition of the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale in 1986. This edition covers the ages two through twenty-three and has some considerable changes compared to its predecessors (Graham &amp; Naglieri, 2003). This edition was the first to use the fifteen subtests with point scales in place of using the previous age scale format. In an attempt to broaden cognitive ability, the subtests were grouped and resulted in four area scores, which improved flexibility for administration and interpretation (Youngstrom, Glutting, &amp; Watkins, 2003). The fourth edition is known for assessing children that may be referred for gifted programs. This edition includes a broad range of abilities, which provides more challenging items for those in their early adolescent years, whereas other intelligence tests of the time did not provide difficult enough items for the older children (Laurent, Swerdlik, &amp; Ryburn, 1992).

Gale Roid published the most recent edition of the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale. Roid attended Harvard University where he was a research assistant to David McClelland. McClelland is well known for his studies on the need for achievement. While the fifth edition incorporates some of the classical traditions of these scales, there were several significant changes made.

==Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale: Fifth Edition==
Just as it was used when Binet first developed the IQ test, the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale: Fifth Edition (SB5) is based in the schooling process to assess intelligence. It continuously and efficiently assesses all levels of ability in individuals with a broader range in age. It is also capable of measuring multiple dimensions of abilities (Ruf, 2003).

The SB5 can be administered to individuals as early as two years of age. There are ten subsets included in this revision including both verbal and nonverbal domains. Five factors are also incorporated in this scale, which are directly related to [[Cattell-Horn-Carroll]] (CHC) hierarchical model of cognitive abilities. These factors include fluid reasoning, knowledge, quantitative reasoning, visual-spatial processing, and working memory (Bain &amp; Allin, 2005). Many of the familiar picture absurdities, vocabulary, memory for sentences, and verbal absurdities still remain from the previous editions (Janzen, Obrzut, &amp; Marusiak, 2003), however with more modern artwork and item content for the revised fifth edition.

For every verbal subtest that is used, there is a nonverbal counterpart across all factors. These nonverbal tasks consist of making movement responses such as pointing or assembling manipulatives (Bain &amp; Allin, 2005). These counterparts have been included to address language-reduced assessments in multicultural societies. Depending on age and ability, administration can range from fifteen minutes to an hour and fifteen minutes.

The fifth edition incorporated a new scoring system, which can provide a wide range of information such as four intelligence score composites, five factor indices, and ten subtest scores. Additional scoring information includes percentile ranks, age equivalents, and a change-sensitive score (Janzen, Obrzut, &amp; Marusiak, 2003). Extended IQ scores and gifted composite scores are available with the SB5 in order to optimize the assessment for gifted programs (Ruf, 2003). To reduce errors and increase diagnostic precision, scores are obtained electronically through the use of computers now.

The standardization sample for the SB5 included 4,800 participants varying in age, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic region, and socioeconomic level (Bain &amp; Allin, 2005).

===Reliability===
Several reliability tests have been performed on the SB5 including split-half reliability, standard error of measurement, plotting of test information curves, test-retest stability, and inter-scorer agreement. On average, IQ scores for this scale have been found quite stable across time (Janzen, Obrzut, &amp; Marusiak, 2003). Internal consistency was tested by split-half reliability and was reported to be substantial and comparable to other cognitive batteries (Bain &amp; Allin, 2005). The median interscorer correlation was  .90 on average (Janzen, Obrzut, &amp; Marusiak, 2003). The SB5 has also been found to have great precision at advanced levels of performance meaning that the test is especially useful in testing children for giftedness (Bain &amp; Allin, 2005). There have only been a small amount of practice effects and familiarity of testing procedures with retest reliability; however, these have proven to be insignificant. Readministration of the SB5 can occur in a six-month interval rather than one year due to the small mean differences in reliability (Bain &amp; Allin, 2005).

===Validity===
Content validity has been found based on the professional judgments Roid received concerning fairness of items and item content as well as items concerning the assessment of giftedness (Bain &amp; Allin, 2005). With an examination of age trends, construct validity was supported along with empirical justification of a more substantial ''g'' loading for the SB5 compared to previous editions. The potential for a variety of comparisons, especially for within or across factors and verbal/nonverbal domains, has been appreciated with the scores received from the SB5 (Bain &amp; Allin, 2005).

== Present use ==
Since its inception, the Stanford–Binet has been revised several times. Currently, the test is in its fifth edition, which is called the ''Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales, Fifth Edition'', or SB5. According to the publisher's website, "The SB5 was normed on a [[stratified random sample]] of 4,800 individuals that matches the 2000 [[U.S. Census]]". By administering the Stanford–Binet test to large numbers of individuals selected at random from different parts of the United States, it has been found that the scores approximate a [[normal distribution]]. The revised edition of the Stanford–Binet over time has devised substantial changes in the way the tests are presented. The test has improved when looking at the introduction of a more parallel form and more demonstrative standards. For one, a non-verbal IQ component is included in the present day tests whereas in the past, there was only a verbal component. In fact, it now has equal balance of verbal and non-verbal content in the tests. It is also more animated than the other tests, providing the test-takers with more colourful artwork, toys and manipulatives. This allows the test to have a higher range in the age of the test takers. This test is purportedly useful in assessing the intellectual capabilities of people ranging from young children all the way to young adults. However, the test has come under criticism for not being able to compare people of different age categories, since each category gets a different set of tests. Furthermore, very young children tend to do poorly on the test due to the fact that they lack the ability to concentrate long enough to finish it.

Current uses for the test include clinical and neuropsychological assessment, educational placement, compensation evaluations, career assessment, adult neuropsychological treatment, forensics, and research on aptitude. Various high-IQ societies also accept this test for admission into their ranks; for example, the [[Triple Nine Society]] accepts a minimum qualifying score of 151 for Form L or M, 149 for Form LM if taken in 1986 or earlier, 149 for SB-IV, and 146 for SB-V; in all cases the applicant must have been at least 16 years old at the date of the test.

'''The Park Centre for Mental Health''' is a heritage-listed [[psychiatric hospital]] at 60 Grindle Road, [[Wacol, Queensland|Wacol]], [[City of Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], Australia.&lt;ref name="qhr"&gt;{{cite QHR|15115|Wolston Park Hospital Complex|600340|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Australia. The hospital provides a range of [[mental health]] services, including extended [[inpatient]] care, mental health [[research]], [[education]] and a high security psychiatric unit. It was designed by [[Kersey Cannan]] and built from 1866 to 1923. It is also known as Goodna Hospital for the Insane, Goodna Mental Hospital, Woogaroo Lunatic Asylum, and Wolston Park Hospital Complex. It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 21 October 1992.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The Wolston Park Hospital Complex, opened in 1865, occupies a 450 hectare site on the banks of the [[Brisbane River]] at Wacol and encompasses a number of mental health facilities and ancillary services operated by the Queensland government since inception of the asylum.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The hospital employs around 450 people, including 220 [[nurse]]s and 20 [[Physician|doctor]]s. There are also another 80 allied health staff, and 50 administration personnel.
In addition there are 70 support staff, including maintenance, groundskeeping, security and laundry staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.qld.gov.au/the_park/org_profile.asp|title=The Park - Centre for Mental Health: Organisational Profile|year=2010|publisher=Queensland Health|accessdate=27 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317003006/http://www.health.qld.gov.au/the_park/org_profile.asp|archivedate=17 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Planning===
Prior to 1859, mentally ill people in the colony of Queensland had been sent to [[Sydney]]. Following the [[Separation of Queensland]], they were lodged instead at the [[Brisbane Gaol]]. In 1861 the government instructed [[Queensland Colonial Architect|Colonial Architect]] [[Charles Tiffin]] to report on a suitable site and draw up plans for a 400-bed asylum. Tiffin recommended an area of land on the banks of the [[Brisbane River]] halfway between [[Brisbane]] and [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]], which was rejected by the [[Queensland Government]] in favour of another site close by, upstream at the junction of the Brisbane River and Woogaroo Creek.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The site of the new asylum had "been formerly occupied by the residence of Dr [[Stephen Simpson (doctor)|Stephen Simpson]], the Commissioner of Crown lands." &lt;ref name="history-1" /&gt; Dr Simpson was appointed Commissioner for Crown Lands for the [[Moreton Bay|Moreton Bay District]] in 1842 when the area was first opened up for free settlement following the closure of the [[Moreton Bay Penal Settlement|Moreton Bay penal settlement]]. He was also the acting administrator, until the arrival of [[John Clements Wickham]], and a Justice of the Peace. Simpson's first home in the colony, built in 1843-1844, was at [[Woogaroo]]. In 1851, when the opportunity to buy land in the area arose, he purchased 640 acres to the east and soon built [[Wolston House]] further down the Brisbane River.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

An 1861 survey plan indicates the presence of a house between the mouth of Woogaroo Creek and the small dam which still exists to the east of the current Wolston Park Golf Club clubhouse.&lt;ref name="history-2" /&gt; If this plan is accurate, the house, most likely Simpson's, would have been sited just south-west of the clubhouse. Late 1860s plans of the asylum's original buildings indicate that they were located at the east end of the current clubhouse.&lt;ref name="history-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

===Construction===
Tenders for the first stage of construction of the asylum were let in 1863 and by the end of 1864 sufficient buildings were completed for the asylum to begin operation. The [[Woogaroo Lunatic Asylum]] opened on 10 January 1865. On 12 January, seven prison warders (two of them women) and ten police constables escorted 57 male and 12 female lunatics from Brisbane Gaol to Woogaroo, travelling by river on the steamer ''Settler''. The 69 patients were accommodated in a two-storeyed brick building initially intended to be the administration block (no longer extant). Male patients were accommodated on the first floor and part of the ground floor. Females occupied a section of the ground floor. A tall timber fence surrounded the building and timber outbuildings accommodated a kitchen, bathroom and staff areas. Dr [[Kersey Cannan]] was appointed as Superintendent and a residence was constructed for him on the site (no longer extant). This first stage of the asylum was located at the southern end of the site between the Brisbane River and Woogaroo Creek, with the river providing access to the site. Plans of the site made {{circa|1869}} and in 1878, indicate that a cemetery or graveyard was established at the far western end of the site, near the confluence of Woogaroo Creek and the Brisbane River.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

In 1866 a ward for fee-paying patients was erected on an adjacent ridge about {{convert|400|m}} to the east of the main buildings (later Female Wards 1 &amp; 2). The building was constructed from local sandstone extracted from a nearby sandstone quarry formerly owned by [[Joshua Jeays]], which was also the source of stone for the construction of [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Parliament House]] in 1864. The superintendent Dr Canaan claimed responsibility for the building's design, based on principles recommended in the standard treatise on asylum construction, The Construction and Government of Lunatic Asylums of 1847 by [[John Conolly]]. The Woogaroo Asylum was not, however, in a position to receive fee-paying patients and the building was unoccupied for two years until alterations were made so that female patients could be transferred to this block. A second storey was added, constructed to the design of Charles Tiffin in 1875, and other substantial alterations and additions were made to the building in both 1904 and 1923. This building accommodated female patients for over 100 years.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

===Inquiries===
In 1867 the first of many Government inquiries into the operations of the asylum took place, with the Government appointing Dr [[Henry Challinor]] to investigate conditions there. Two further inquiries occurred in 1869 - the first inquiry was conducted by public servants, and the second by a select committee of members from both houses of [[Queensland Parliament]]. Dr Cannan was dismissed from his post as a result of the first inquiry. The second inquiry revealed a multitude of mistakes and incompetency and a number of its conclusions related to the inappropriate and insufficient accommodation on site and the improvement of cooking facilities and the provision of a decent water supply. On the recommendation of the select committee, the Queensland Government introduced the Lunacy Act of 1869, based on similar legislation in other Australian colonies and Britain.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

It was not until a Royal Commission was established in 1877 to investigate Woogaroo Asylum and other reception houses in the colony that the Government was forced to take the continuing problems at the asylum more seriously. Despite the construction of two cottage wards in the early 1870s (no longer extant), overcrowding remained a chronic problem and the commission urged the construction of additional wards, improvements to existing cells, upgrading of services, the planting of shade trees, the establishment of recreation facilities and the provision of employment for patients. A modest building program began in 1878 with the construction of a cottage ward for 60 female patients and continued with a block of cells for troublesome female patients in 1879, two wards each for 35 patients in the male and female sections in 1880 as well as the construction of a kitchen and laundry building to service 500 patients (these buildings are no longer extant).&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

===Expansion===
[[File:Wolston Park Hospital Complex - Bostock (2001).jpg|thumb|Bostock House, 2001]]
A boom in the Queensland economy and a major increase in expenditure on public works was the impetus for a more substantial building program at the asylum during the 1880s. At the same time, the population of the state was increasing rapidly and accompanying social changes brought greater numbers of admissions to the asylum, then known as the [[Goodna Asylum]]. The hospital population doubled in the two decades from 1880. Two new cottage wards (one of which is now known as Bostock House, 1885) and a refractory ward were erected in the female section and a new refractory ward was constructed (no longer extant) and major additions to the existing No 1 ward were undertaken in the male section. Despite this new work, conditions for patients scarcely improved as the additional accommodation barely matched the growth in patient numbers. New legislation was introduced with the Insanity Act of 1884 replacing the Lunacy Act of 1869. It was modelled on New South Wales legislation and reflected the growing medicalisation of the treatment of madness. The term lunacy was replaced by insanity and the institution where such persons were treated became known as a hospital for the insane rather than an asylum. This Act consolidated the State's role in the treatment and regulation of insane people and remained in force for over fifty years.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

===Flooding===
In 1890 the asylum experienced severe flooding as the Brisbane River rose to a height of {{convert|40|ft}}, the highest level ever recorded. The entire male section was inundated; buildings, fences and other structures were seriously damaged and patients had to be re-located. The decision was made to abandon the low-lying area near the river where the main male section was located and consolidate it on higher ground where two wards had already been erected. The relocation brought the complex closer to the [[Main Line railway, Queensland|Main Line railway]] (opened in 1875), which replaced the river as the primary means of access to the hospital. The Recreation Hall was erected in 1890 and was used as a sewing room by female patients during the days and was also available for dances, concerts and church services.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The male section was further damaged by in the [[1893 Brisbane flood]] that also inundated the main staff residences. In line with the decision to relocate the male section on higher ground, work began on an outdoor recreation area and Fleming House, a two storeyed brick building with accommodation for 50 male patients, was opened in 1898. Verandahs were located at ground level on the northern side of the building, overlooking the cricket oval that had been laid out by patient labour. The same year, a substantial brick residence (now Manor House), replacing a timber house badly damaged by the 1893 flood, was erected for the new medical superintendent, [[James Hogg (doctor)|James Hogg]], appointed in 1898. The residence was located on high ground but with its main elevation facing south-east, away from the asylum complex. Most of the other staff resided off the site. For many decades the hospital was serviced by employees who lived in the local area and there are now a number of staff who have a family history of employment at the complex going back generations. During Hogg's period in charge, the complex became known as the [[Goodna Hospital for the Insane]].&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

===Further expansion===
The most significant building project of the early 1900s involved extensive alterations and additions to the original female ward. A new level was built on the existing building that significantly increased accommodation. A large two-storeyed block, the male no. 4 ward (no longer extant) was also completed, bringing the male section to a well-defined group of eight buildings. A new morgue and two brick bathroom blocks were constructed in 1902. (Both bathroom blocks remain, one of which is now known as Dawson Annexe).

===Changes in treatment and accommodation from 1908===
Following the sudden death of James Hogg in 1908, [[Henry Byam Ellerton]] was appointed to replace him as superintendent of Goodna and Chief Inspector of Hospitals for the Insane. Conscious of the need to find the very best possible candidate, the Queensland Government had advertised widely for the position, including in Britain. Ellerton was chosen from a list of twenty-six applicants and had fourteen years experience in English asylums. He was an ardent advocate of "[[moral treatment]]" or moral therapy. Moral treatment marked a major turning point in an understanding of madness and insanity. Formerly regarded as the total absence or distortion of reason and incapable of cure, insanity came to be seen as a product of an immoral or defective social environment, thus mentally ill people could be improved in an appropriate and elevating environment. A critical aspect of moral treatment was the provision of a pleasant environment, with an emphasis on well-lit and ventilated buildings with adequate bathing facilities, reasonably sized rooms with sufficient openings and views to the landscape. Recreation and employment were also considered a vital part of the therapeutic process.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

Ellerton was superintendent of the hospital for 28 years, retiring in 1936. In this period, Wolston Park acquired its modern form with the construction of the core of its buildings and the consolidation of the institutional environment. Ellerton's vision was to create an integrated and self-sufficient community, the grounds became gardens and wooden fences were replaced with less claustrophobic wire ones. A large bush house, 100 yards long and 20 yards wide, was established in 1911 to maintain a steady supply of pot plants for the wards and recreation hall and to provide seedlings and young plants for the gardens throughout the asylum (no longer extant). The institution was opened up to visits from relatives and friends and recreational activities became integral to the asylum's operations. While aesthetically-pleasing gardens and views were considered parts of the therapeutic process, the grounds were also important to the public image of the institution. A pleasant landscaped environment with gardens, scrubs and open space suggested the asylum was a benign institution and belied its true character as a place where overcrowding was chronic and patients were strictly controlled and managed.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt; In 1916 the hospital was again improved with the addition of a ward for those suffering a physical disease as well as a mental disorder.
[[File:Wolston Park Hospital Complex powerhouse (2001).jpg|thumb|Powerhouse, 2001]]
During Ellerton's reign, existing male wards were demolished and Lewis House, Noble House and McDonnell House were completed in 1915. A new bridge over Woogaroo Creek was completed in 1916. A female admission ward, Anderson House, the hospital, the administration block, the powerhouse, water reservoirs and pumping stations were completed in 1917. The laundry was completed in 1918. Osler House, a ward for difficult female patients was completed in 1929 and Pearce House, for difficult male patients was completed in 1934. The male wards Gladstone House, Jenner House and Kelsey House were completed in 1936. Upon Ellerton's retirement, the male section comprised a total of 13 blocks, all constructed of brick and designed to accommodate between 20 and 120 patients. Despite the upgrading of facilities, overcrowding remained a chronic problem. The increase in beds from 1910 to 1936 failed to correspond to the increase in the number of patients.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

Compared with the extensive building program in the male section between 1910 and 1936, improvements in the female section were extremely modest. Ellerton felt that the expansion of the female section was limited due to the topography of the Goodna site and advocated additional female wards at other institutions such as [[Ipswich Mental Hospital]]. In the period 1910-1920, the number of female inmates decreased by 20%, falling from 491 to 389 patients and the 1910 female population level was not regained until 1929. Male patients increased by 30% during this period, rising from 779 to 1010.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

During Ellerton's period in charge, the asylum had undergone considerable material improvement and a number of essential services such as electricity, water and a hospital had been established. Many of the buildings were well designed and are excellent examples of the output of the [[Department of Public Works (Queensland)|Queensland Department of Works]] during this time. Some of the buildings demonstrated a refinement in approaches to patient care, such as the small and domestic scale Anderson House that was designed to accommodate female patients when they were first admitted so they could be kept under observation and receive more individual treatment than was possible in a large ward. Recreational facilities had vastly improved and the complex now had three tennis courts, a viewing pavilion and terraces and an oval considered one of the best cricket grounds in the state. A golf course had been constructed by patient labour in the 1920s, becoming the well-regarded [[Gailes Golf Club]], which continued to be a source of employment for patients in the upkeep and maintenance of the greens. Patients were also employed in farming activities that aided the hospital's self-sufficiency. Farm activities included a piggery, dairy, a small cattle herd, vegetable and crop growing including oats, maize and lucerne. However no new techniques or methods of treatment had been introduced. Even the later male wards, Gladstone, Jenner and Kelsey, were still firmly based on the moral therapy model despite their new designs with unusual, crab-like plan forms. The institutionalisation of people with mental illness in Queensland had become an efficient system of control and regulation with an emphasis on confinement rather than treatment or care. More patients than ever were admitted to Goodna and no other solution to the treatment of mental illness was even considered possible.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

Ellerton was succeeded as Medical Superintendent by Dr [[Basil Stafford]], the former Superintendent of Ipswich Mental Hospital. Ellerton's retirement provided the opportunity to review the entire mental health system in Queensland and in particular, Ellerton's total commitment to "moral therapy". By the late 1930s [[psychiatry]] was a well-established specialty internationally, though still in its infancy in Australia and Stafford was alert to the changes psychiatry was bringing to the treatment of mental illness. In 1937 he was sent by the Queensland government to attend the 2nd International Congress on Mental Hygiene in Paris and on a study tour of hospitals, psychiatric clinics and universities in the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

===Change of focus from 1938===
On his return, Stafford recommended various changes to the mental health system, including the implementation of new legislation. These recommendations led to the Mental Hygiene Act of 1938, which closely resembled the British Mental Treatment Act of 1930. The hospital was again renamed the [[Goodna Mental Hospital]] and the hospital was reorganized into two units, one for the chronically ill requiring a secure environment and the other for acute and recovering patients.The Mental Hygiene Act of 1938 brought a focus on prevention and cure through voluntary treatment. Until this time hospitals such as Goodna received only certified patients, most of whom were sent there under a Magistrate's order. However, the transition to a less coercive approach to treatment occurred slowly and in 1947 Stafford reported that only 34 of the total 570 patients had been admitted under the voluntary provisions of the Act.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The ideas of modern treatment introduced by Stafford emphasised the development of a comprehensive psychiatric approach with adequate numbers of qualified medical staff. Insanity was seen as a disease of the brain and like any other disease required hospitalisation of patients and treatment with drugs. He noted:&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Modern treatment demands exhaustive mental and clinical case histories, as well as completely thorough physical examination. This cannot be done by a skeleton staff, however willing".&lt;/blockquote&gt;This approach also brought degrees of specialisation among the staff and hospital procedures. Stafford advocated the separation of chronic wards from those dealing with admission, convalescence and hospital cases. He believed that mental illness "demands active therapy, and treatment must not become merely custodial" and urged the use of new types of treatment such as [[Insulin (medication)|insulin]], [[cardiazol]] and [[electrotherapy]].&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;
[[File:Dawson (2001).jpg|thumb|Dawson House, 2001]]
The first building at Wolston Park to reflect Stafford's modern ideas was Dawson House, a new female building completed in 1944. It provided accommodation for 60 patients and was located on a sloping site close to the existing female wards. It was recognised that a building with a basement could be built on such topography, with the basement accommodating treatment rooms for cardiazol therapy, insulin therapy, [[Malarial therapy|malaria therapy,]] somnifaine or continuous narcosis therapy and other medical treatments. The most striking difference was that minimal attention was given to the outside environment - this building was inward-looking, signalling the demise of the significance placed on the environment in "moral treatment" and the increasing medicalisation of the treatment of mental health. Another important building project for female patients at this time was the construction of a special female recreation facility, which commenced in 1951 on an area of approximately 2.5 hectares on the western edge on the reserve, adjacent to the Brisbane River. The principal building within the area was the cafeteria with facilities to serve 500 patients (now Wolston Park Golf Clubhouse). Patients could spend the whole day in the recreation area without needing to return to the wards for midday meals. Other facilities in the area included a sewing room, tennis court, bowling green, a large playing field, viewing shelters and storage sheds. By 1957 more than 200 patients were regularly using the facilities, highlighting the rigorous separation of patients according to gender that operated in all facets of the institution.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

By January 1942, 110 returned soldiers were inmates of Goodna Mental Hospital and the Australian Government expressed concern about the growing numbers being admitted. War veterans had become a significant minority of the hospital population since the final years of the [[First World War]] and Ellerton had decided upon consideration, that using existing institutions was preferable to building new facilities. During the [[Second World War]], however, the Australian Government agreed to fund the construction of three special wards, with the Queensland Government agreeing to responsibility for the maintenance of the buildings and for staffing. Plans for a complete repatriation unit were prepared by the Works Department in consultation with Basil Stafford. Their design essentially resurrected the principles of "moral treatment" - the buildings were designed to minimise the sense of confinement associated with mental hospitals and freedom was emphasised by wide verandahs and dining areas opening onto grassed courtyards and lawns. Construction of the wards began in 1946, and the Wacol Repatriation Pavilion was opened by [[Queensland Governor]] [[John Lavarack]] on 26 January 1948. It comprised three wards each with accommodation for 88 patients and a kitchen/canteen block. A recreation hall was erected in 1950 and a cricket oval in 1954.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

In the late 1940s, planning began for a new farm ward complex. Farm wards at the hospital had traditionally operated as semi-independent units where patients enjoyed greater levels of freedom and autonomy, unlike the main wards where people were locked in their cells or wards. A new site on the summit of a hill adjacent to the existing farm wards was chosen and two large wards with accommodation for 175 patients and a dining/recreation block were erected between 1953 and 1957. Patients included both "backward persons" and people who had responded well to treatment and had the potential for recovery and discharge. In 1958, part of the farm ward complex was set aside for patients regarded as "subnormal" and in 1964 a five teacher school was established to teach the 160 children who lived there. Gradually, all of this block became occupied by intellectually disabled children and was renamed the Basil Stafford Centre. In 1965 a new alcohol rehabilitation centre was also established, making use of the old farm ward buildings at the northern end of the site. Alcoholics had been patients at Wolston Park since the Inebriates Act of 1892 had allowed for their admission to designated institutions; however, there had been no specific facilities for them. New buildings were erected adjacent to the former farm ward including four wards, offices and an occupational therapy area. The new centre was known as the Wacol Rehabilitation Centre. Initially it served both male and female patients; later a separate complex was built for female patients requiring treatment for alcoholism (Melaleuca House and Poinciana House).&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The hospital population peaked in the mid-1950s, with an average of approximately 2500 residents daily (not including Wacol Repatriation Pavilion patients) and 700 staff.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

===Decline in numbers===
By the late 1950s the efficacy of large-scale, all-purpose institutions for the treatment of mental illness began to be questioned. It was recognised that patients became institutionalised to the extent that living in large institutions perpetuated their mental disorders and did not assist them to recover. The Division of Mental Hygiene embarked on a program of expanding acute psychiatric beds in general hospitals and transferring elderly senile patients from mental hospitals to nursing homes. This resulted in a decline in the number of patients at Goodna and in 1960, Director Basil Stafford was able to report that, for the first time, the hospital had an excess of beds. The complex, renamed the [[Brisbane Mental Hospital]], began to develop a different role. No longer did it cater for every type of patient from every part of the Queensland; instead the majority of inmates were long-term chronic patients. The new Mental Health Act of 1962 placed a greater emphasis on voluntary admission and the complex became known as the [[Brisbane Special Hospital]]. In 1969, it was renamed [[Wolston Park Hospital]].&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

In 1976 the Minister for Health released a paper on the Care of the Intellectually Handicapped, which proved to be the catalyst for significant changes in the delivery of mental health services. A special Branch of Intellectually Handicapped Services was established within the [[Queensland Health|Health Department]] in 1977, which took responsibility for the Basil Stafford Centre. Research into the long-term effects of institutionalisation and the lack of success in the treatment and care provided in institutional settings led to critical questioning of the institutional model for both mentally ill and intellectually and physically disabled people. In addition, the increasing criticism of conditions within mental hospitals and the abuse of patients' rights gave impetus to the development of alternative models, in particular, community-based mental health services. The community care model was adopted slowly in Queensland. Institutions were reformed, however, an emphasis on institutional care remained.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

Short-term care with intensive treatment was the preferred model. Several major building projects, which reflected these changing ideas, were undertaken at Wolston Park during the 1970s, as well as extensive re-modelling of existing structures. In 1978, the Barrett Psychiatry Unit was established to provide acute care. It comprised eight separate buildings, a reception and admission block, three wards with 32 beds, two wards with 16 beds, cafeteria and medical officer's flat. In 1984 it expanded to include inpatients and specialised services for young people. A new medical centre opened in 1979 and in 1980 Nyunda Park was set up as an outdoor recreation area. The [[John Oxley Centre]], a forensic psychiatric unit, was built at the eastern side of the site next to the Brisbane River in 1990. A number of the 19th century buildings were demolished in the 1970s and 1980s, with renovation and rehabilitation of other remaining 19th century buildings occurring in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

In 1989 the [[John Oxley Memorial Hospital]], a special purpose secure psychiatric facility, was opened on the grounds of the Wolston Park Hospital; it has since been demolished.

===Modernisation from 1996===
As part of the 1996 Ten Year Mental Health Plan for Queensland, the main hospital became known as The Park Centre for Mental Health and has decentralised its extended care services with a greater emphasis on rehabilitation and recovery. The Park now provides clinical treatment and rehabilitation programs to patients from central and southern Queensland, including care for people with a chronic mental disorder and for people with a mental disorder who are also intellectually disabled, forensic care services and an extended treatment service for adolescents.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

From 1999 to 2002 many new buildings were erected, including a large new maximum-security facility at the eastern edge of the site. Most of the new buildings are domestic in scale and character and include accommodation for patients and medical and administrative facilities. Some replace buildings erected during the 1970s, such as parts of the Barrett Psychiatric Centre.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

In 2001 the hospital was renamed The Park Centre for Mental Health Treatment, Research &amp; Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.qld.gov.au/the_park/walk.asp|title=The Park - Centre for Mental Health: A Walk Through Time|year=2010|publisher=Queensland Health|accessdate=21 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317003214/http://www.health.qld.gov.au/the_park/walk.asp|archivedate=17 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The Wolston Park Hospital Complex comprises a number of public health institutions, several of which have been decommissioned. The complex includes The Park Centre for Mental Health (former Wolston Park Hospital), Basil Stafford Centre, Wacol Rehabilitation Centre (male and female), Wacol Repatriation Pavilion, Barrett Psychiatric Centre and the John Oxley Centre. Sections of the reserve are leased to the [[Gailes Golf Club]] and the Wolston Park Golf Club.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The site can be divided into the following major elements: Central administration area; Services support area; Former residences; Male area; Female area; Female recreation area; Wacol Repatriation Pavilion; Wacol Rehabilitation Centre; Basil Stafford Centre; Nyunda Park/riverbank area and the Grounds in general.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

=== Central Administration Area ===
The central administration area includes the Administration building, the Former Hospital, Pump houses and reservoir, Chapel, and Visitor's Pavilion.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The Administration Building (1917) is a two-storeyed brick building with a [[terracotta]]-tiled roof, decorative [[Flèche|fleche]] and brick [[chimneys]], designed to be the centrepiece of the institution. [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] influences are evident in the massing of the [[hipped roof]] forms and the use of unpainted brickwork contrasting with coloured roughcast plaster above [[Window sill|sill]] height. The main entrance on the eastern elevation features an arched [[Porte-cochère|port cochere]], adjacent to an oval [[driveway]] with formal landscape elements, including plantings of [[cycad]]s. The entrance is given greater prominence by two tower-like wings with separate hipped roof located on either side of the port cochere. There is a [[veranda]]h on the ground floor on the western elevation with brick and timber [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and [[stairs]] located both centrally and at each end. Internally the building comprises office accommodation arranged off central hallways with regular arched partitions. The rooms generally have plastered masonry partition walls with timber joinery. The building has a central timber staircase and some stained timber and glass partition walls. An Honour Board is located in the entry hall on the ground floor.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;
[[File:Hospital (2001).jpg|thumb|Former Hospital, 2001]]
The Former Hospital (1917) is located to the north of the Administration Building, across grassed terraces built by patients. It is a low-set, single-storeyed, symmetrical brick building with hipped terracotta-tiled roofs and a decorative fleche, sympathetic in design to the Administration Building. The entrance is marked by a projecting entry [[Bay (architecture)|bay]] with [[gable]] roof and the wings of the building extend to either side. A slightly elevated verandah with brick and timber piers runs the length of the front elevation of the building and floor to ceiling multi-paned [[sash window]]s are located along all walls. Small windows are also located above the verandah roof and below the [[eaves]] of the main roof. The rear of the building has five small projecting wings, some no more than the size of a single room. The central projecting wing is the largest. It was the former operating room and has a five-sided projecting bay with large windows in each section. Timber sash windows with concrete sills and [[Lintel (architecture)|lintels]] are found throughout the building. The interior of the building contains office accommodation for clinical staff.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The pump houses and reservoir (1914) are located adjacent to Ellerton Drive, the principal access to the administration area. There are two timber pump houses, an elevated water reservoir and a second smaller reservoir. The northern pump house (1914) located closest to the road is sheeted with pine [[chamferboard]]s and has vented semi-circular openings above all its windows. It has a hipped [[corrugated steel]] roof with exposed [[rafter]]s and no [[Rain gutter|gutters]]. The second pump house (date unknown) is located to the east and sits beneath a large tree. It is a smaller building, clad in timber [[weatherboard]]s and has a pitched corrugated steel roof with galvanized iron [[awnings]] over two windows. Both pump houses are empty. The main reservoir (1914) is constructed of rendered brickwork approximately {{convert|5|m}} deep, enclosed by a structure consisting of {{convert|2|m|adj=on}} high cast iron [[columns]] which support an open, [[Latticework|lattice]]-framed perimeter [[truss]]. The truss supports a timber framed roof structure and the entire structure is clad on both the roof and walls in corrugated galvanized iron.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

A Visitor's Pavilion (1920) is located further along Ellerton Drive, on the same side as the pump houses and reservoir but closer to the Administration Building. It is a small, low-set, hexagonal timber structure accessed by a short set of timber steps. The entry is a small projecting bay with a pitched roof, decorative timber mouldings, lattice and [[balustrade]]. The building is clad in timber weatherboards, has timber framed windows and a painted corrugated steel roof with decorative [[finial]].&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

One chapel building (formerly the Chapel of Hope, 1961) remains of the three chapels originally erected around a ring road about {{convert|100|m}} east of the Administration Building. It is a simple, box-like structure with a low-pitched roof and wide eaves. It is of portal frame construction and is clad in corrugated [[BlueScope|Colorbond]] steel sheeting. The building is now semi-integrated with a new building built on its western side. A tall, steel, open-frame tower is located on the eastern side of the front elevation. A statue of [[St Dymphna]] (the Catholic Patron Saint of the Mentally Ill) is located about {{convert|20|m}} to the east.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

=== Services Support Area ===
The Services Support Area comprises the Recreation Hall, Laundry, Power House and Morgue and is located to the west of the Administration Building.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The Recreation Hall (1890) is a symmetrical rectangular brick building with a pitched roof. The front elevation has a central elevated doorway surmounted by a decorative circular window with coloured glass and [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]] accentuated in light, contrasting brickwork, a decorative detail that is repeated around the windows and doors. The building has a large central hall area with separate wings running down each side. The central hall space has a partly-lined raked ceiling from which the lower members of the roof [[trusses]] protrude and a timber floor. There is a raised timber stage at the southern end with a [[proscenium arch]] with decorative [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[pilasters]] on either side. A projection room is located at the northern end of the hall. Dark brick additions with [[flat roof]]s run the full length of the building on both the east and west elevations and accommodate smaller recreation rooms and a kitchen.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The Laundry (1918) is a large single-storeyed brick building on concrete [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]], with a concrete floor. Its architectural details show an Art and Crafts influence. The building has four large gabled roofs, each of which has two raised [[roof lantern]]s that allow light to penetrate the large interior spaces of the building. Externally, the building sits on a face brick [[plinth]] with roughcast [[stucco]], painted pale yellow, above the windowsill level. The southern elevation is characterised by striking sets of windows under each gable - each section has a large central window with arched head and side windows, all highlighted with contrasting brick surrounds and accentuated [[Keystone (architecture)|keystones]]. A flat roofed verandah is located on the western elevation and is accessed by a concrete ramp. There are also a series of large timber double doors and sets of [[Louver|louvres]] along this elevation. The eastern elevation runs parallel to the street and has regular sets of tall windows grouped in threes. The interior of the building has large concrete pillars supporting exposed [[timber roof truss]]es. Recent offices, meeting rooms and conference rooms have been constructed within the building and are enclosed with [[plasterboard]] partitions. A [[Cafeteria|canteen]] is located in the northwestern corner of the building.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The Power House (1917) is an imposing red brick building with a substantial, octagonal brick [[chimney]] at its northwestern corner. It has two steel-trussed gabled roofs clad in corrugated galvanized iron with raised vented roof lantern running the length of the building. It is built on concrete foundations and contains [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] tube boilers. Regular arched openings are on all sides of the building; some have sets of nine windows and others have doors. All the arches are highlighted externally by the use of bricks of a slightly deeper red tone. Circular windows are located in the gable ends on the northern and southern elevations. The upper floor has recently constructed offices, built as a free-standing series of rooms within the larger interior space of the building. These offices are constructed of plasterboard. Some internal walls are finished to a height of six feet with white enamelled brick with green trim. The huge boilers and other engineering equipment are located on the ground floor.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The Morgue (1902) is a low-set single-storeyed brick building situated below the Power House, to the north. It has a simple rectangular plan form with a hipped corrugated iron roof with a small decorative fleche. A lean-to structure with large timber doors on the western end of the building is a hearse [[shed]]. The building has large openings with concrete lintels and sills, with boarded-up openings.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

=== Former residences ===
The former Medical Superintendent's Residence and Assistant Medical Superintendent's Residence are located at the eastern edge of the site.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The former Medical Superintendent's Residence (1898) is now situated within the strongly fenced, high security area of the complex and is used as office accommodation. It is a substantial low-set brick residence with a corrugated steel roof. It has an asymmetrical plan with projecting [[bay window]]s and complex verandah forms. The eastern elevation has two projecting verandah wings with multi-faceted roofs and tall brick chimneys.

The residence has a generous entrance hall, several marble fireplaces and high quality timber joinery throughout the interior.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The Assistant Medical Superintendent's Residence (1912) is located to the east of the former Medical Superintendent's Residence. It is a large timber dwelling set on stumps, with a hipped corrugated iron roof and extensive verandahs. The interior has timber joinery, two fireplaces and [[pressed metal ceiling]]s in the major rooms. Mature [[palm trees]] are formally set around the house and both residences are surrounded by terraced lawn areas. A concrete garden stair is located to the south of the former Assistant Medical Superintendent's Residence, leading to an unfenced former tennis court.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

=== Male Area ===
The Male Area is an extensive area with a number of buildings grouped around the large Recreation Grounds. Lewis House, McDonnell House, Noble House, Osler House and Pearce House are all located along Barrett Drive to the west of the cricket oval. Fleming House, Gladstone House, Jenner House, Kelsey House and a former male bathroom are all located at the southern end of the oval.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

Fleming House (1898) is a two-storeyed building located at the southeastern corner of the [[cricket oval]], amongst lawns and mature trees. It is constructed of light-coloured brick with narrow bands of red bricks at sill level on both floors and at the upper floor-line. It has a hipped roof with boxed-in eaves and decorative timber [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]. A detached bathroom building (1920) is centrally located on the southern elevation; it has a [[pyramid roof]] with a raised central roof lantern and a [[lean-to]] addition at the rear with a brick chimney. There is a verandah on the ground floor on the northern side, overlooking the cricket oval. A centrally-located metal staircase dominates this elevation of the building. Narrow [[casement window]]s with concrete sills and lintels are found on all elevations.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;
[[File:Kelsey (2001).jpg|thumb|Kelsey House, 2001]]
Gladstone House, Jenner House and Kelsey House (all 1936) are located to the east of Fleming House and are nearly identical in form, scale and detail. Like Fleming House, these buildings are situated to overlook the cricket oval. The buildings are all single-storeyed brick buildings with unusual crab-like plan-forms, set within gardens enclosed with low wire fences. The gardens are mostly lawn with mature trees such as [[Delonix regia|Poincianas]]. The central portion of each building comprises a large dining/day room with service facilities such as kitchens and bathrooms to the rear. The four wings of each building contain [[Dormitory|dormitories]] and single rooms. Each of the dining rooms has a large [[roof lantern]] with fixed glass panels that allow natural light to penetrate the room. Each of the buildings has terracotta tiled roofs and large casement windows which have aluminium security screens fitted on the outside.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

[[File:Noble 2 (2004).jpg|thumb|Noble House, 2004]]
Lewis House, McDonnell House and Noble House (all 1915) are ward buildings of similar design, located along Barrett Drive. On the eastern side the buildings overlook lawns and the cricket oval. A service road runs along the western side and the surroundings of the buildings are paved in concrete with a raised garden strip containing mature trees between the buildings and Barrett Drive. Lewis House is situated between Kelsey House and McDonnell House and is a substantial two-storeyed rendered masonry building with a terracotta-tiled roof. It has gabled roofs with [[parapet]]ted gable ends and subtle [[quoin]]s on the upper floor. The southern elevation has a projecting wing with pyramid-roofed pavilions at each corner and small square windows. The rest of the building has large casement windows throughout and is smooth rendered to sill height on the second floor and roughcast above. A short verandah with vertical timber louvres is located on the ground floor of the eastern elevation. McDonnell House is situated between Lewis House and Noble House. It is also two-storeyed and constructed of masonry but is more rectangular in plan with three short wings projecting on the western elevation. It has a large gabled roof and gabled roofs on the western wings, all of which have overhanging [[eaves]]. The roof is clad in dark concrete tiles and the building is rendered smooth up to sill height on the second floor, above which it is roughcast. There are two ground floor verandahs on the eastern elevation overlooking the cricket oval, either side of a central projecting gable. Noble House is almost identical to Lewis House but a concrete tiled roof has replaced the terracotta roof and it has a longer verandah on the ground floor on the eastern elevation.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

Osler House (1928) and Pearce House (1934) are one-storeyed ward buildings and are virtually identical in design. They are located adjacent to Noble House, at the northern end of Barrett Drive. The buildings are brick with terracotta-tiled gabled roofs. The eastern part of each building is an elongated U-shape in plan, with two substantial rear wings running at right angles to the U. The eastern elevations have ground floor verandahs which have sheet steel barriers erected along the roofs to prevent patients from climbing onto them. Roof lanterns are located above the central hallway of the rear wings and are visible from the outside of the building although they are closed-in by recent false ceilings in the interior. The gardens are enclosed by tall wire security fences.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;
[[File:Cricket pavilion (2001).jpg|thumb|Cricket Pavilion, 2001]]
The Recreation Grounds is a large expanse of open space, around which the buildings of the male section are grouped. The cricket oval (1895) is the focus of this area. It is a large grassed oval with terraced edges planted with mature trees and lawn. [[Tennis court]]s, [[bowling green]] (1951), bowling green clubhouse (1968) and [[plant nursery]] (original bush house established 1911) are located at the northern end. The Cricket Pavilion (1910) is located at the southern corner of the cricket oval. It is a small hexagonal building with a rectangular wing with gabled roof located at the back. A small timber toilet block is located at the rear of the building. The hexagonal section is surrounded by a verandah with turned timber posts and dowel balustrade.

Female Wards 1&amp;2 (1866) is a large, two-storeyed timber and masonry building located on a ridge between Ellerton Drive and the Brisbane River. The core of the building is [[sandstone]] with a number of large timber and brick additions. The sandstone core is long and rectangular in plan with a projecting two-storeyed bay with timber verandahs on the south elevation. Two elevated brick pavilions ([[BathHouse|bathhouses]]) with raised roof lanterns, concrete floors and supporting posts are located either side of the projecting bay. Three-storeyed brick additions are located at each end of the building. These have corrugated iron roofs with small roof lanterns and regularly spaced sash windows. The main section of the building has three separate roofs, all corrugated iron. The largest is a hipped roof at the northwestern end; the central roof is a pyramid; and the southeastern roof is a smaller hip. A wide timber verandah with a [[skillion roof]] runs the length of the north elevation at both levels and returns around at both the eastern and western ends of the building. It is enclosed with timber shutters on the top storey and has an arched timber [[Window valance|valance]] and timber posts at ground level. Sections of the verandah at the western and eastern ends have been enclosed with timber weatherboards. The sandstone part of the building has narrow, multi-paned sash windows and timber doors with [[fanlight]]s. The interior of the building is gutted and only the timber floor joists and [[cast iron]] columns remain. A small Shelter Shed (1929) is located to the south of Female Wards 1&amp;2 and was used to separate troublesome patients from the main wards. It is a brick structure with a concrete floor and fireplace and a gabled corrugated iron roof. A tall timber [[picket fence]] encloses the yard adjacent to the shed.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

[[File:Kitchen (2004).jpg|thumb|Kitchen block, 2004]]
Wards A and B (1948) are two similar U-shaped blocks that back onto Wolston Park Road. They are constructed of cream brick with hipped, corrugated colourbond steel roofs with boxed eaves. The wings of the buildings enclose grassy [[courtyard]]s, which are surrounded by verandahs. The Kitchen Block (1948) is located in the middle of the Wacol Repatriation Pavilion complex, between Wards A and B. It is two-storeyed and is constructed of the same cream brick with corrugated colourbond steel roof with fleche. It has an open-fronted canteen at the front of the building (facing northeast), opening via folding timber doors onto a terraced lawn area. The rear of the building is accessed by a service driveway from Wolston Park Road. Ward C (1948) is H-shaped in plan and is also constructed of cream brick with a hipped, corrugated colourbond steel roof. It is located at the end of Barrett Drive and has a roofed terrace on the northwest elevation. The Recreation Hall is located to the north of Ward C. The grounds consist of a mix of evenly-sloped lawns with trees randomly planted between the buildings. Clumps of [[Oleander]] bushes are formally spaced along both sides of the lower entry drive. A cricket oval (1954-5) is located to the southeast of the complex. The cricket oval has a white painted picket perimeter fence and a timber sight-screen.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

=== Wacol Rehabilitation Area ===
The former Wacol Rehabilitation Area (now used by the Department of Corrective Services) is located in the northernmost portion of the site and comprises physically separate male and female sections, with the male section occupying former Farm Ward buildings. These consist of Quarter Way House, Farm Ward and Farm Sheds.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

Quarter Way House (1918) is a timber residence erected for the farm overseer. It has a front verandah and rooms are accessed from a central hallway. The former Farm Ward (1916) is a largely timber building with a central core of brick that includes a brick [[fireplace]]. It has a small brick [[Washing|ablutions]] block at the southwest corner. The verandahs are enclosed with glass louvres and the interior is lined with Masonite. Two Farm Sheds (1916) are located across a road to the north of the former ward. They are timber-framed and clad in corrugated galvanized iron.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

=== Basil Stafford Centre ===
The Basil Stafford Centre is located in the northern portion of the site and comprises the former Farm Ward Block, a school building and villa-style accommodation.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The former Farm Ward Block (1957) is a one and two storeyed, brown brick building with four distinct sections. Ward A occupies the single-storeyed section and Ward B is partly two-storey. The central part of the building contains the service areas. The building has hipped corrugated [[Fibre cement|fibre-cement]] roofs and high level, multi-paned sash windows throughout. The grounds of the building are landscaped with open terraces paved with stone from the hospital quarry. A concrete water tower is prominently located at the crest of the hill, adjacent to the former Farm Ward building.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

=== Nyunda Park/Riverbank area ===
This area comprises a mix of open and enclosed bushland, a dam, picnic facilities adjacent to the dam, the John Oxley Centre and remnants of a sandstone quarry.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The John Oxley Centre (1990) is a low-set one-storeyed building clad in fibre-cement with a corrugated steel roof. The building is vacant and is surrounded by tall wire fences. Nyunda Park is an unused area of bushland with a large dam. There are two former sandstone quarry sites in this area, one of which is partly submerged by the dam. The second is adjacent to the riverbank and evidence of workings remain.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

=== The Grounds ===
Two golf courses form the perimeter of the hospital complex along the southern and eastern edges. The Gailes Golf Course extends around the hillside between Wilruna Street and the railway line, the recent high security development at the eastern side of the site and the Wacol Repatriation Pavilion. The Wolston Park Golf Course is situated on the gently sloping hillside south of the Central Administration area and includes the land cleared between Woogaroo Creek and the female recreation area. The golf courses maintain the spacious, natural and open landscape setting of the complex. The site of the 1860s graveyard associated with the establishment of Woogaroo Asylum is located at the far western end of what Wolston Park Golf Course, and is a site of potential archaeological interest.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The rest of the grounds consist of a mix of open space areas with extensive lawns, clumps of scrub and numbers of mature trees. Formal gardens are found in the immediate environs of many of the buildings. Ellerton Drive is the formal road through the grounds from the Goodna entrance to the site and is flanked by an avenue of trees. The lower portion of the drive is lined with elms ([[Celtis sinensis]]), the middle portion alongside the reservoir is lined with [[Araucaria cunninghamii|Hoop pines]] and [[Bunya pines]] and the top end of the drive is planted with large pines. The road has sandstone kerbing.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

==Facilities==
The hospital currently can accommodate 192 patients through five clinical treatment and rehabilitation programs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.qld.gov.au/the_park/about.asp |title=The Park - Centre for Mental Health: About Us |year=2010 |accessdate=21 September 2010 |publisher=Queensland Health |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401052131/http://www.health.qld.gov.au/the_park/about.asp |archivedate=1 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
Wolston Park Hospital Complex was listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.'''

As the earliest and best-known public institution providing care and treatment for mentally ill and intellectually disabled people in Queensland, Wolston Park Hospital Complex is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history. The Woogaroo Asylum was founded by the Queensland government as the first publicly-funded, mental health institution in the colony in the early 1860s and by the 1950s became the largest such institution not only in Queensland, but in Australia. The provision of health and welfare services was regarded as the responsibility of charitable and religious organizations in the 19th century; the care and treatment of mental illness was the one exception, thus the Wolston Park Hospital Complex demonstrates the role of the state in the care of mentally ill people since the 1860s. It demonstrates the changing practices in the treatment of mental illness: from a 19th-century asylum founded on confinement and separation, through moral treatment or therapy from 1909 to the 1930s, the drug and medical therapies of the 1940s (Mental Hygiene) and 1960s (Psychiatric Services) to the trend towards deinstitutionalization and community-based services by the 1980s. The physical evolution of the site highlights these changes as the complex has developed incrementally across the substantial 450hectare reserve, rather than intensively in layers in one area. The site is also significant in demonstrating the development of specialist mental health services for returned service personnel and intellectually disabled people.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history.'''

The site of an early [[graveyard]] at the western end of what is now the Wolston Park Golf Course, near the confluence of Woogaroo Creek and the Brisbane River and associated with the first asylum buildings on the reserve, is an area of archeological interest with potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.'''

Wolston Park Hospital Complex demonstrates the principal characteristics and evolution of a major public health institution. The expansive grounds and distinctive groups of buildings at the complex evoke a strong sense of place. The self-contained nature of the place is reflected in the range of buildings and facilities on the site including ward accommodation, health and hospital facilities, administration buildings, staff quarters, recreation facilities, chapels and service buildings such as kitchens, laundries and a powerhouse. The grounds and landscaping are also important elements with recreation and agricultural facilities demonstrating the role of useful employment and recreation in the hospital's operations. The relationships between the buildings and other site elements are fundamental to our understanding of the functioning of the place as a mental health institution since the 1860s.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

A substantial number of buildings, structures and grounds elements survive from each major phase in the development of the institution.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Significant 19th century elements include Female Wards 1&amp;2 (1866), Bostock House (1885), the Recreation Hall (1890), Fleming House (1898), the former Medical Superintendent's Residence (1898) and the recreation ground (1895, redeveloped into cricket oval in 1910). The remnants of a sandstone quarry along the riverbank dates from the 1860s and was one of the first sandstone quarries developed in Queensland.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Early 20th century elements include the three male blocks Lewis House (1915), Noble House (1915) and McDonnell House (1915), former male and female bathroom blocks (1902), the female ward Anderson House (1917), the former hospital ward block (1917), the Administration Building (1917) and the assistant Medical Superintendent's residence (1912); service facilities such as the morgue (1902), the reservoir (1914), pump house (1914), powerhouse (1917) and laundry (1918) and recreation facilities such as the cricket oval (1910) and the Cricket Pavilion (1910). Significant elements of the former farm ward complex include the Farm Ward (1916), two farm sheds (1916) and Quarter Way House (1918).&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Important elements from the capital works program of the 1920s and 30s include the Visitor's Pavilion (1920), Osler House (1929), the shelter shed at the rear of Female Wards 1&amp;2 (1929), Pearce House (1934), Kelsey House (1936), Gladstone House (1936), Jenner House (1936) and the Gailes Golf Course (1922–25).&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Postwar elements include Dawson House (1944), the Female Recreation Area encompassing the cafeteria (1955), workroom (1950) and shelter sheds (1955). The remaining chapel (1961) demonstrates the provision of religious services and chaplaincy at the complex. Significant elements of the Wacol Repatriation Pavilion established post World War Two include Ward A (1948), Ward B (1948), Ward C (1948), kitchen and canteen (1948), and Recreation Hall (1950). The former Farm Ward Block (1957), now part of the Basil Stafford Centre, is also important.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.'''

The Wolston Park Hospital Complex is important because of its aesthetic significance, which derives from the massing, architectural form and detailing of the buildings, the relationships between the buildings and the interplay between the buildings and the landscape and grounds.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The aesthetic impact of the complex is heightened by its location on the top of a hill and its setting within extensive grounds that have a distinctive, natural landscape character. The complex includes a range of architectural styles and forms; from modest timber visitor pavilions through to imposing brick ward and administration buildings. Care in the design of hospital buildings and grounds reflects efforts to mitigate the stigma attached to mental illness, while at the same time the substantial and formal character of many of the buildings demonstrates strong State control and regulation of mentally ill people in Queensland.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

Wolston Park Hospital Complex is the longest operating mental health facility in the State and a distinct culture has developed around the institution. As such, Wolston Park Hospital Complex has a strong and special association for the Queensland mental health community including staff, patients, families, friends and advocates, both past and present. The complex also has social significance for the Queensland community in general, being synonymous with the treatment of mental illness in the State.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

[[Malay titles#Tun|Tun]] '''Thirunyanasambanthan s/o Veerasamy''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia|SSM]] [[Order of the Defender of the Realm|PMN]]}} ({{lang-ta|திருஞானசம்பந்தன்|Tiruñāṉacampantaṉ}}; 16 June 1919–18 May 1979) also known as '''V.T. Sambanthan''', was the fifth President of [[Malaysian Indian Congress]] and one of the Founding Fathers of [[Malaysia]] along with [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] and [[Tan Cheng Lock]]. He was the MIC President from 1955 to 1973, when he was ousted by party members.

Sambanthan was one of the leading Indian leaders who played a prominent role in the independence movement in Malaya. As president of the [[Malaysian Indian Congress|Malayan Indian Congress]] (MIC) during this important period of transition, he worked closely with Alliance Party leader Tunku Abdul Rahman and they developed a close personal bond.

He is credited with three important developments in Malaysian political history: the consolidation of the Malayan (now Malaysian) Indian Congress, its transformation into a mass-based party, and its integral role as a partner in the current ruling alliance.

The entry of the MIC into the multi-communal [[Barisan Nasional|Alliance]] in 1955 contributed greatly to enhancing the coalition's image as the main representative of the three main communities in Malaya.

The finest hour was achieved on 31 August 1957 when [[Hari Merdeka|Independence]] was achieved under the Merdeka Agreement, to which Sambanthan was a signatory.

==Background==
Sambanthan was born in [[Sungai Siput]] in 1919. His father, M.S. Veerasamy, came to [[British Malaya|Malaya]] in the 1896, was a pioneer rubber planter in [[Sungai Siput]], Perak and owned several rubber plantations. His siblings are V. Meenachi Sundram, V. Krishnan and V. Saraswathy .

Sambanthan received his early education at Clifford High School in [[Kuala Kangsar]], Perak. A keen sportsman, Sambanthan was an intelligent student who loved to chat and joke.

==Political career==

===Early Involvement===
Sambanthan, with the intention of creating a more cohesive and unified Indian community, organised the Perak United Indian Council in 1953, the same year he was elected Perak [[Malaysian Indian Congress|MIC]] chairman.

However, the event that helped catapult Sambanthan to the forefront of MIC politics was a visit by [[Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit]], the younger sister of the then Indian prime minister Pandit [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. Sambanthan had befriended her when he was involved with the [[Indian National Congress]] while studying at [[Annamalai University]].

On his invitation, she visited [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] in 1954 and despite the ongoing communist insurgency, visited [[Sungai Siput]] where she officially opened the Mahatma Gandhi Tamil School. The meeting between Sambanthan and Vijaya Lakshmi in 1954 helped push the former into the limelight and then on to the party president's position in 1955

In the same year, he was elected member of the legislative council for the Kinta Utara constituency. The constituency was renamed in 1959 as the [[Sungai Siput]] seat.

===Becoming MIC President===
In the post [[World War II]] period, the Indian professional elite was largely held together by the unifying ideology of Indian nationalism. In 1946, the Indian elite in Malaya formed the MIC. For the first eight years, the MIC leaders were either North Indian or Malayalee, representing a minority among the Indians. The majority of Indians (90%) in Malaya at that time were South Indians, mainly from the labouring class.

[[The Emergency (India)|The Emergency]] (declared by the British in 1948 to battle communist insurgency) regulations and new trade union legislation also led to the leadership of the trade union movement passing from the [[Chinese Malaysian|Chinese]], who were much better organised, to the [[Indian Malaysian|Indians]]. This dilution of the MIC's objectives affected the status of Indian plantation workers in the Malaysian economy then and its repercussions are still being felt today.

In 1954, there were serious debates within the MIC as to whether the partys should join the [[UMNO]]-[[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]] Alliance that was emerging as the leading political movement in the country, following their successes in local elections. The MIC had aligned itself with Datuk [[Onn Jaafar]]'s [[Independence of Malaya Party]] and later Party Negara, and there was a rethink within the MIC leadership during this period.

According to Rajeswary Ampalavanar, author of The Indian Minority and Political Change in Malaya 1954–1957, the MIC leadership was quite eager to join the [[Barisan Nasional|Alliance]] but there was some resistance within the party's broader membership. They were willing to support the move if the party could secure some concessions from the Alliance on inter-communal issues, particularly on education.

Then MIC president [[K.L. Devaser]] came under heavy criticism from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] media for not addressing the pressing issues facing the community. While he was quite outspoken, his influence was largely among the urban-based Indian elite and he lacked wider grassroots support.

Some in the party felt that there was a need for a leader with a stronger relationship with the party's grassroots. In March 1955, reports in the local daily Tamil Murasu urged Tamils to boycott the MIC.

Sambanthan, then a state MIC leader, emerged during this period as an alternative candidate for the party leadership. Going by historical records, he was literally coerced into taking up the presidency. Another candidate, P.P. Narayanan, was approached by party leaders but turned down their invitation because he wanted to concentrate on union activities.

Sambanthan initially declined but following some pressure from the Tamil leaders agreed to take on the party leadership. He was duly elected the fifth president of the MIC in May 1955. Sambanthan was also acceptable to the Malay leadership because he played down political (and to some extent, economic) rights in favour of cultural and language rights.

===Becoming a Tamil party===
The [[Malaysian Indian Congress|MIC]]'s main challenge was to reconcile the political aspirations of the middle class with the poverty and needs of the labouring class, who in 1938 comprised 84% of the plantation labour force. Sambanthan started a recruitment campaign among plantation workers, relying on patronage of [[Hinduism]] in its popular South Indian form, increased use and fostering of the Tamil language, and Tamil cultural activities.

But the [[Malaysian Indian Congress|MIC]] under Sambanthan failed to reconcile the needs of labour with the political aspirations of the middle class. The traditionalists and the lower middle class strengthened their hold within the party, while the upper class professionals and the intelligentsia moved away from it. Subsequently, two paths to leadership emerged among the Indians – political and trade union – with very little interaction between them.

Under Sambanthan's leadership, the [[Malaysian Indian Congress|MIC]] effectively became a Tamil party. Sambanthan  served as president of the MIC from 1955–71 and was largely responsible for the transformation of the party from an active, political organisation to a conservative, traditional one, emphasising Indian culture, religion and language.

It was also the weakest of the three main political parties. It had the smallest electorate – 7.4% in 1959; and it had little support from the Indian community at large.

Since the Indian community was geographically dispersed and divided, it comprised less than 25% in any constituency. Therefore, the MIC's over-riding concern was to remain a partner in the Alliance (the [[UMNO]]-[[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]]-[[Malaysian Indian Congress|MIC]] Alliance that had won the first elections in 1955, and that was subsequently renamed [[Barisan Nasional]]) and obtain whatever concessions it could from the dominant [[UMNO]]. In the process, political and economic rights of workers were sacrificed.

Sambanthan, while as MIC president, helped strengthen the party economically by selling about half of his father's 2.4&amp;nbsp;km² rubber estate to help the Indian community as well as to provide financial strength to the party coffers.

Sambanthan took over the mantle of the MIC during a period of turmoil in the party in 1955, barely months before the first federal elections, and over time strengthen the party and consolidated its position in the coalition. He did not always please his members, but was able to gradually unite a party that had considerable internal splits.

===First federal elections===
The year 1955 was a milestone for Malaya's advance towards self-governance. The British colonial administration had agreed to hold the first federal elections in July 1955 and Sambanthan was instantly thrown into the cauldron of electoral politics.

He met the new challenge and following negotiations with the Alliance leaders the MIC was allocated two seats – in [[Batu Pahat]], Johor, and [[Sungai Siput]], Perak. Sambanthan Thevar contested the [[Sungai Siput]] seat and won comfortably.

The Alliance swept 51 of the 52 seats, the exception being a seat in Perak. Following the election win, Sambanthan was appointed to the Cabinet and sworn in as Labour Minister in the [[Barisan Nasional|Alliance]] government.

The coalition decided to push for a quicker transfer of power and an Alliance delegation went to London in January 1956 to hold talks on a range of issues, including independence, with Secretary of State Alan Lennox-Boyd.

===Merdeka negotiations===
Earlier, in 1956, Sambanthan led the MIC delegation in the negotiations between the Alliance parties in drawing up a memorandum to be presented to the [[Reid Commission]].

Sambanthan was a pragmatic negotiator and worked hard to secure the interests of the Indian community, while at the same time being sensitive to the broader interests of the Alliance party's diverse membership.

He was at times criticised by his party members for conceding on certain issues, but Sambanthan was faced with the need to find a suitable balance to the various sectoral demands and sought to take a middle path in the negotiations. For taking such as position, he was praised by the Tunku.

The final constitutional negotiations in London in May 1957 also saw a personal transformation in Sambanthan. While in London for the constitutional talks, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] decided that Sambanthan needed new attire.

Sambanthan had caused some controversy when he wore a dhoti upon being elected into the [[Federal Legislative Council]] – a practice deemed [[taboo]] during the British period. But Sambanthan defended his choice, arguing: “It makes the average man feel happier.” Even after the elections in 1955, when he was appointed Minister of Labour, his traditional Indian attire remained intact.

Thus when in London, Tunku decided that something must be done. As the Tunku describes in his book Looking Back: “When walking with me in London, he was always trailing behind because he could not step out far enough to keep pace with me; or perhaps I walked faster on purpose. One day when we were out for a walk, I led him into Simpson’s men’s store in Piccadilly. On reaching there, I said: ‘Come in; I want to choose a new suit’, so he followed me inside.

”I asked the tailor to fit Sambanthan with a good ready-made suit. He protested, but only briefly, accepting the inevitability, and came out a new man in a new suit – West-End tailored, new shirt, new tie, new shoes and socks.”

The Tunku noted that after that incident, Sambanthan was not satisfied with just one suit and secretly went out to buy several more.

During the debate on the draft Constitution at the Federal Legislative Council on 10 July 1957, Sambanthan urged greater co-operation between the communities, reminding them that Malaya was a plural society. He told the council:
{{quote|We belong to a plural society, and we should always remember that in such a society we have to recognise that psychology has its own place. It is not enough if one's own attitude towards a problem is good.  It is necessary that he should see what reaction, what effect it would have on members of different communities.}}

===Working with the Tunku===
The MIC's success in the early years was due to the close personal friendship between [[Malaysia]]'s first prime minister, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman|Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj]], and Sambanthan. For his part, Sambanthan ran the [[Malaysian Indian Congress|MIC]] as a largely informal party, in deference to Umno, rather than as a political party with definite programmes.

In effect, it became a vehicle for distributing patronage (senate and legislative votes, nominations for decorations and awards, licences) to supporters, furnishing the [[Indian Malaysian]] vote, and an instrument for the leadership to entrench its role. But patronage was always in short supply and, eventually, rising dissatisfaction with Sambanthan led to a prolonged leadership crisis in the party.

===Working with Tun Abdul Razak===
When [[Tun Abdul Razak|Tun Abdul Razak Hussein]] succeeded [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] as Malaysia's prime minister, the MIC was forced to become much more responsive to the dictates of [[UMNO]]. This was following the [[May 13 Incident]] and Razak was more assertive than the Tunku to demonstrate ''Malay Supremacy'' or ''[[Ketuanan Melayu]]''.

Sambanthan, by now bearing the title "Tun", was forced to retire in favour of [[V. Manickavasagam]] in 1973. This intervention is an indication of the inertia that had gripped the MIC following Sambanthan's rise to leadership in 1955.

==Ministerial posts==
As president of a party that was a component of the ruling Alliance Party, he was appointed Minister of Labour (1955–57), Health (1957–59), Works, Posts and Telecommunications (1959–71) and National Unity (1972–74).

During the time the Malaysian Government decided to ban the Chinese lion dance and racial tension was high after 13 May 1969, Tun Sambanthan as National Unity Minister in the early 1970s, took some Chinese leaders to Genting to talk things over. The discussions were successful and the lion dance ban was later lifted because the Government realised it was important to maintain each race's culture.

Apart from ministerial duties, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] often assigned important tasks to Sambanthan. In 1968, the Tunku sent Sambanthan to [[Fiji]] as an emissary of peace; the Chief Minister of Fiji acknowledged Sambanthan's contribution in a letter to Tunku thanking him for the "great success" of the delegation "under the superb leadership of Tun Sambanthan".

Sambanthan also joined the delegation to [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]] in 1966 to witness the signing of an agreement whereby diplomatic relations between [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] were normalised after the [[Indonesian Confrontation]] episode.

V. T. Sambanthan was also acting prime minister for one day when both the prime minister and his deputy were out of the country at the same time [http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/3/11/focus/10882962&amp;sec=focus].

After resigning as president of MIC, he was appointed chairman of the National Unity Board (1974–78) that replaced the National Unity Ministry.

Throughout his political career, which spanned 25 years, he had preached and practised the doctrine of unity amidst diversity. Appropriately enough, in the Malaysian context, it was to national unity that he devoted the last few years of his life.

==Contributions==
In his own way, Sambanthan instituted some reforms among Indian plantation workers. For example, he promoted education and thrift among Indian workers, lobbied for the introduction of English language instruction in Tamil schools in [[Perak]] and for the transformation of the South Indian Immigration Labour Fund into an education fund for the children of plantation workers.

The greatest challenge that [[Malaysian Indian Congress|MIC]] faced during his presidency was the fragmentation of estates, the livelihood of almost all Indian workers. In a bid to help the fragmentation, the party sponsored cooperative efforts to acquire estates and prevent displacement of the workers.

In 1960 Tun V.T. Sambanthan touted the idea of a social co-operative to help plantation workers during the British land sell off. Tun Sambanthan and [[K. R. Somasundram]] worked closely to purchase their first estate at Bukit Sidim in that same year. The co-operative was later called National Land and Finance Co-operative Society (NLFCS).

He toured rubber plantations to persuade workers to buy shares in the cooperative; a worker with a registration fee of $2 and a share costing $100 (payable in instalments) could buy a stake in a plantation.

At the time of his death in 1979, the cooperative had bought over 18 estates, totalling 120&amp;nbsp;km² and had a membership of 85,000 workers. The Malayan Plantation Agencies administered the estates on behalf of the cooperative.

His wife, [[Uma Sambanthan|Toh Puan Umasundari Sambanthan]] served as chairman and director of the National Land Finance Co- operative Society (NLFC) from 1980 to 1995 and its president in 1995 and 1996.

[[K. R. Somasundram]] has since taken over the Chairmanship of the company upon the death of Tun Sambanthan and is still actively involved in the co-operative. Today NLFCS has 19 estates totalling {{convert|35000|acre|km2|0}}, as well as investments in Palm Oil, Property and Banking.

==Family==
Tun Sambanthan was married to [[Uma Sambanthan|Toh Puan Umasundari Sambanthan]]. The couple's daughter, Deva Kunjari, is a lawyer.
