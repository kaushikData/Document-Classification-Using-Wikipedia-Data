==Early life and struggles==
He completed his schooling from Spring Dale College, Indira Nagar, [[Lucknow]] in 1995 and completed his Graduation from [[Lucknow University]] in 1999 before venturing out to [[Mumbai]] for becoming a singer.

In a prolific interview given to the "[[Times of India]]" in 2013, Bhattacharya said that he migrated to [[Mumbai]] from [[Lucknow]] harbouring dreams of becoming a [[singer]] fourteen years ago (1999). He stood in the long queues in front of music composers' office and gave them demo "Audio Cassettes"  to listen to him. But it didn't bear any fruit.

He went up to music composer &amp; director [[Pritam Chakraborty]]. It was Pritam who gave him work and allowed him to assist.

During his struggling days, he started writing [[lyrics]] for Advertisement jingles to lower his frustration of not getting work. He learned the art of song-writing during those struggling days.

In the year 2004, when his friend Amartya Rahut introduced him to music composer [[Amit Trivedi]], Trivedi and Rahut, who often composed music for television channels, took Bhattacharya as a dummy singer to give presentations of his music. Trivedi also urged him to write rough lyrics. While writing lyrics, Bhattacharya discovered that he had an innate talent of giving words to tunes. Over the years, Trivedi and Bhattacharya became good friends.&lt;ref name="tune"&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://m.hindustantimes.com/brunch/amitabh-bhattacharya-the-reluctant-lyricist/story-Y94NrenCvKTJkT2yu5Y8AK.html|title=Amitabh Bhattacharya the reluctant lyricist|publisher=Hindustan Times|author=Parul Khanna Tiwari, Hindustan Times|date=4 February 2012|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His major breakthrough came when Trivedi was working upon the music of [[Anurag Kashyap]]'s [[Dev.D]], Trivedi insisted Bhattacharya to write rough lyrics. Bhattacharya wrote the lyrics for the songs of Dev.D, and most of its major songs became a hit, thus nearly ending 8 years of his struggle for recognition.&lt;ref name="nobody"/&gt;

'''André Burthe d'Annelet de Rosenthal''' (1772–1830) was a Baron of France.

== Biography ==

[[File:Blason famille fr André Burthe (baron).svg|thumb|Coat of Arms of André Burthe]]
André Burthe was born in [[Metz]] in France on 8 December 1772, allegedly into a family of Irish refugees who had followed [[James II]] of England to France.&lt;ref&gt;Le Bas, Philippe. France. Dictionnaire encyclopédique. Tome troisième, BIL-CAI. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However his father Nicolas Burthe was a descendent of a line of merchants in Metz, so it is unclear where this allegation arises. His father married Françoise d'Annelet in the parish of St Eucaire in Metz on 29 October 1771: according to Laussat&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Clément de Laussat ''Memoirs of my life: to my son during the years 1803 and after, which I spent in public service in Louisiana as Commissioner of the French Government for the retrocession to France of that Colony and for its transfer to the United States'', The Historic New Orleans Collection Monograph Series, 1978, {{ISBN|0-8071-0365-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolas was an ex-soldier who had joined a manufacturing enterprise in Metz, and the young André studied under a parish priest in Lorraine. He entered military service on 6 April 1791 at the age of 19 as a simple cavalier in the Second Regiment of Dragoons, after which his career had a meteoric rise. He served in the Armée du Nord 1792-4 during the [[French Revolution]].

Burthe fought with distinction at the [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)]], after which he was made provisional second lieutenant of the 10th Regiment of Dragoons on 13 April 1793. This appointment was confirmed in May of that year and he took part in three campaigns at that grade; in 1794 he was wounded in combat.

He served in the Armée du Rhin 1794-95 and entered the General Staff as an adjutant general to Solignac in the Armée d'Italie in February 1796. In 1797 he was promoted to capitaine d’Etat-major to the army in Italy and in October the following year became first aide de camp to [[André Masséna]] in the Armée d'Helvétie. He took part in the campaign in the Helvetic Republic and was promoted to Chef d'Escadron in the field at the [[First Battle of Zurich]] in 1799. He was seriously wounded twice by musket balls at the [[Siege of Genoa (1800)]].

Masséna, recognising the young man’s merit, honoured him with a particular friendship and charged him once he was recovered with the formal presentation of the Italian enemy flags captured at the [[Battle of Marengo]] on 14 June 1800 to the new First Consul of France ([[Napoleon Bonaparte]], following a coup the previous year). The General raised him to the rank of adjutant-general, a promotion confirmed on 14 July 1800, when the presentation took place at a public display on the Champ de Mars in Paris: an address was made by Lannes and Burthe also made a speech.&lt;ref&gt;Emile-Auguste Bégin,''Biographie de la Moselle'' p 217 https://books.google.com/books?id=1ysTAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA217&amp;dq=Burthe#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the Armée de Batavie in October and served in Holland and Hanover from 1801. He was named Chief of Staff of the troops in Holland commanded by General Victor, and followed him with the same rank in the Louisiana Expedition.

=== Burthe in Louisiana ===
Burthe accompanied the Prefect [[Pierre Clément de Laussat]] (1756–1835) to [[New Orleans]] in 1803. Laussat was a diplomat and administrator sent by Napoleon Bonaparte to New Orleans to oversee the transfer of Louisiana (which had been Spanish since the 1760s) from Spain to France (and, as it turned out, the subsequent sale to the United States). The papers of the Laussat collection relate to the retrocession of Louisiana from Spain to France by the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]] and the transfer of the territory to the United States under the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Before Laussat left France, he had started to gather data and pertinent information on the colony of Louisiana, and these materials, together with his correspondence, formed the core of his official file which he later brought back with him to France. Laussat gathered documents generated by the Spanish colonial administration, which included royal decrees and implementing orders, regulations on local government, and official reports. His collected papers also include a Decree ordering the arrest of Adjutant Commandant André Burthe, and an Order of [[Manuel María de Salcedo]] and the [[Sebastián Calvo de la Puerta, 1st Marquess of Casa Calvo|Marqués de Casa Calvo]], commissioners of Spain, New Orleans, to Adjutant Commandant André Burthe, New Orleans.

In his memoirs, Laussat records his version of the history of the very public animosity between him and Burthe, which appears to have begun even before the party left France. General Victor commissioned Burthe to accompany Laussat, a civilian travelling with his wife and daughters, in an advance party to arrive ahead of the troops of the main Louisiana expedition. It appears that Burthe’s view was that as a member of the military, he should take command of the personnel of the troops while leaving Laussat charge of the supplies and equipment, an idea which Laussat opposed vehemently, seeing himself as in charge of the entire expedition. Laussat initially succeeded in having Burthe dropped from the expedition, but he was reinstated through the intervention of General Victor and joined the company's ship at Rochefort. According to Laussat, Burthe had neither passport nor formal permission to board the ship, and depended on the offices of Laussat himself to ensure he was able to travel. Laussat describes Burthe as having a character marked by conceit and irascibility; although he was not lacking in intelligence, his mind was disorderly and full of revolutionary ideas involving military despotism. However, as Laussat himself was a difficult character who was not well liked by many of his peers, his opinions should be viewed with a degree of objectivity.

Laussat reports that Burthe avoided accompanying him in any formal contact with Admiral Martin, the naval prefect at Rochefort, or with the Spanish commander. It does seem, however, that Burthe made his own separate visits to both, presenting letters from General Victor, and giving the impression that he had secret orders of his own which he did not share with the Prefect. 
 
Meanwhile, New Orleans was surprised by the receipt of the momentous news that Louisiana was to be transferred from Spain to French rule. Preparations were made to quarter the large party of French officers who were expected to arrive in the colony, but on 21 March 1803 local officials saw the arrival of a single ship, the French corvette ''Surveillant'', with on board just Laussat, his family, a small suite of officers and civilian associates, and of course adjutant-general Burthe, who was expected to attach himself to General Victor's staff when that commander should eventually arrive.

Laussat bore a commission as Colonial Prefect. In the government to be established in Louisiana this official was to have powers similar to, but more extensive than, those previously enjoyed by the ruling Spanish Intendant. The remaining officials were to be a Captain-General whose functions paralleled those of the Spanish Governor-General, and a Commissary of Justice set up to superintend the administration of justice and compile a civil and criminal code. In the end, Laussat was the only one of these officials to arrive: Victor, who was appointed Captain-General and Commissioner to receive the Province from the Spanish on the behalf of France, never reached Louisiana.

As early as April 1803 Laussat reported to his government that he was beginning to find his position difficult. It does appear that, as a result of his own personality as much as the force of circumstances, he managed to alienate all parties, even the most rabid Republicans. The Royalists and émigrés saw in him merely the agent of a hated government. His relations with the official classes also gradually grew unpleasant. Laussat attributed this to the influence of the Marquès de Casa Calvo, who arrived in May as the Spanish Commissioner for the transfer of the Province. The power struggle between Burthe and Laussat begun on the voyage from France escalated, representing the rivalry between military and civilian authority.&lt;ref&gt;'Civilian versus military prerogatives in Napoleonic Louisiana: the Laussat-Burthe affair 1803', ''Louisiana Review'' 6, Summer 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Each refused to recognise the jurisdiction of the other, and the Spanish Governor Salcedo openly received Burthe as if he were a representative of the French government, and allowing him to inspect barracks and hospitals, an action guaranteed to alienate Laussat still further. The animosity between the two Frenchmen became increasingly public, with both parties indulging in disgraceful behaviour, including deliberately organising rival dinner parties and competing for prominent guests. Matters came to a head when both men invited the official Vinache to dinner on 14 July 1803; when Vinache only gave conditional acceptance of Burthe's invitation, Laussat claims that Burthe attempted to place Vinache under arrest. Vinache complained of this to Laussat, with the result that Laussat informed Casa Calvo that he was issuing a warrant demanding Burthe’s arrest and return to France. (This warrant survives in the collection of Laussat's published papers.&lt;ref&gt;http://hnoc.minisisinc.com/THNOC/SCRIPTS/mwimain.dll/144/THNOC_MANUSCRIPTS/WEB_DETAIL_M2A_INHOUSE/REFD+%27mss%20125%27?SESSIONSEARCH&lt;/ref&gt;) However the Spaniard would not recognize Laussat's rights to make such a demand: he took the ground that, until the Province was actually transferred to France, Spanish authority prevailed.

After this, Laussat publicly snubbed Burthe and flounced out of a formal dinner given by Casa Calvo on 14 October 1803 on discovering that Burthe was also present, announcing that it was not possible for the two of them to be in the same room. The following week, Laussat claims that he refused to pay the officer’s salary, telling him to refer the matter back directly to the First Consul. Fortunately for Burthe, by this time he had met the 15-year-old heiress Marguerite-Suzanne Delord-Sarpy (1788–1863), daughter of a wealthy widow and prominent family of the town. (She was granddaughter of Pierre Antoine Foucher de Circé and older sister of Louise Delord Sarpy, who married André's younger cousin [[Dominique François Burthe]], who had also travelled to Louisiana as part of the advance party.)

The couple were married on 23 July 1803 by the hospital chaplain under a special dispensation.&lt;ref&gt;''No. 281 Burthe, French Adjutant-General, wishes to marry Susana Margarita Sarpy. He has produced the necessary documents and asks that (Hassett) give the order to the pastor of the Cathedral to dispense them from two of the banns as he does not know from day to day when he may be called to service outside the province. http://archives.nd.edu/mano/18031007.htm''{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event, Louisiana was French for just three weeks (30 November–20 December 1803) as the area became an American territory on 20 December. When they had set out from France to reclaim Louisiana, the Frenchmen had had no way of knowing that Napoleon would sell Louisiana to the United States in April and that France would govern the province for just that three-week interregnum.

André and Suzanne left the colony soon after these events, having secretly booked passage for New York on the American ship ''Pastley'', which they joined on 18 January 1804, and thence sailed to France. Burthe's parting shot was to leave a pamphlet ''Burthe contre Laussat''&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/BurtheContreLaussatPremirePartie&lt;/ref&gt; (publication date 1 January 1804), written in French, which bore the epigraph from Juvenal ‘Facit indignatio versum’ [Indignation makes the verse] and set out Burthe’s interpretation of Laussat’s conduct. In response, on 11 April 1804 Laussat’s supporter Jean-Paul Blanque published a reply (in French), ''En opposition à Burthe contre Laussat''.

=== Subsequent military career ===
[[File:Edouard Detaille - Vive L'Empereur - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|4th Hussar at the [[Battle of Friedland]], 14 June 1807. "Vive l'Empereur!" by [[Édouard Detaille]], 1891.]]

Burthe returned to Paris with his new wife to pursue his military career. He was promoted to Colonel of 4th Regiment of Hussars on 1 February 1805 and Suzanne, contrary to the reputation of Creole women for being modest and domestic, gaining notoriety by donning military uniform and accompanying her husband on his campaigns.

In December 1805 Burthe led his regiment at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] as part of the Light Cavalry Division under Kellerman.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.histoiredumonde.net/Bataille-d-Austerlitz.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keithrocco.com/inventory/details.php?productid=183&lt;/ref&gt; Suzanne followed him to the battlefield and was reputed to be by the side of the Emperor when night fell.&lt;ref&gt;Simone de la Souchère Deléry, ''Napoleon's soldiers in America'', Firebird Press 1972&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1806 Burthe was made Commandeur de la Légion d’Honneur in recognition of his valour. He took part in the campaigns in Prussia and Poland: despite having been wounded at Liebstadt in January, he fought at the [[Battle of Friedland]] on 14 June 1807, leading three squadrons of the 4th Hussars. He followed the Brigade to Spain in September 1808 and was made 1e Baron d’Annelet et de l’Empire on 5 October.&lt;ref&gt;Armoiries du baron d’Annelet: écartelé: le premier d’azur au sauvage d’or (portant un carquois et s’appuyant sur un arc du même, posé sur le sol à senestre); le second des barons militaires; le troisième de gueules au six drapeaux en sautoir d’or posés en trophée; le quatrième parti d’argent et d’azur, l’argent à la tête de cheval de sable surmontée d’un étoile d’azur, l’azur chargé d’une lyre d’or; livrées: les couleurs de l’écu&lt;/ref&gt;

Burthe continued to distinguish himself at the [[Siege of Zaragoza (1809)]]. When Burthe was appointed Général de Cavalerie, his wife became a member of his staff and was known as ‘Monsieur d’Annelet’. She had remained with her husband through his posting to Spain until he arrived at [[Bayonne]], at which point she saw the wisdom of returning to Paris to become a glittering member of society and take care of her growing family. Meanwhile, André took part in the campaign in Aragon at the [[Siege of Lérida (1810)]] and was further promoted to Général de Brigade on 30 December 1810.

In December 1811 Burthe was made head of the 8th Brigade of the Second Division of Light Cavalry (Wathier St Alphonse), and served with the Division during the campaign of 1812. He was injured in Moscow in September and taken prisoner by the Russians in November, and was not released until July 1814. He took up arms again in 1815 during the [[Hundred Days]], and led the 1st Brigade of the 9th Cavalry Division at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], fighting against the English.&lt;ref&gt;http://roglo.eu/roglo?lang=fr&amp;m=NG&amp;n=Andr%C3%A9+Burthe&amp;t=PN&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Bourbon Restoration]] Burthe retired from military service; on 6 January 1825 he was granted a pension of 4,000 francs.

=== Civilian life and retirement ===
In 1812 the couple purchased the domaine de la Roche-du-Parc in [[Noisy-le-Grand]] (now the site of the Hôtel de Ville of Noisy-le-Grand: the original farm was demolished in 1864 and replaced by the chateau which survives today)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.noisylegrand-tourisme.fr/decouvrir-noisy-le-grand/le-patrimoine-noiseen/les-personnalites/andre-burthe-dannelet-1772-1830.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as part of the nearby Bois Saint-Martin. Four of their ten children were born in the new family home. André and Suzanne became involved in the local community: the baron was named municipal councillor by the Prefecture from 1817 to 1819, and his wife was awarded the title of 'la Mère des pauvres' by the Conseil municipal. The Burthes sold the property in Noisy-le-Grand to the Buissons, a Creole family, in 1827 and appear to have lived out their final years in the city of Paris.

André Burthe d’Annelet died on 2 April 1830 at the Rue St Lazare in Paris, leaving his wife and 8 surviving children. He is buried at the  [[Père-Lachaise cemetery]] in Paris (28th division Square of Maréchaux).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.appl-lachaise.net/appl/article.php3?id_article=1237&lt;/ref&gt; His wife died in 1863 and is buried next to him: her tomb inscription records that she was awarded the [[Médaille de Sainte-Hélène]], participated in the campaigns of 1805-1808 and accompanied her husband to Iéna and [[Auerstedt]].  Also buried there are Jules Félix Burthe (1804–1837), officier de cavalerie, Octavie Burthe (1825–1839) and André Adolphe Burthe (1808–1846), capitaine de cavalerie.

Burthe's name appears  on the 8th column of the north pillar of the [[Arc de Triomphe]]. [[File:Arc de Triomphe mg 6818.jpg|thumb|alt=Burthe's name on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.|Burthe's name on the ''[[Arc de Triomphe]]'' in Paris.]]His bust is also exhibited at the [[Musée de l'Armée]] aux Invalides. The title Baron Burthe d'Annelet was inherited by his son Jules-Félix (1804–1857), who died childless, and subsequently by André's fifth son Charles-François. The family continued to maintain residences at the Rue d'Aumale in Paris and Rosenthal until the 1930s.

'''Augusto Daniel Odone''' (March 6, 1933 – October 24, 2013)  and '''Michaela Teresa Murphy Odone''' (January 10, 1939 – June 10, 2000) were the parents of '''Lorenzo Michael Murphy Odone''' (May 29, 1978  – May 30, 2008), a child with the illness [[adrenoleukodystrophy]] (ALD). They became famous for developing a controversial treatment using [[Lorenzo's oil]], for their son's incurable illness, and this quest was recounted in the film ''[[Lorenzo's Oil]]'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2062622/Obituary-Lorenzo-Odone.html|title=Lorenzo Odone Subject of Lorenzo's Oil, the film portraying his parents' quest to cure his degenerative disease|date=Jun 1, 2008|work=[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augusto had previously been an economist for the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name="Obituary: Augusto"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/10402968/Augusto-Odone.html | title=Obituary: Augusto Odone | work=The Telegraph | date=June 1, 2008 | accessdate=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of the parents' work, Augusto Odone received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Stirling]]. He continued to raise funds and drive the scientific task force known as ''[[The Myelin Project]]'' until his death. Michaela Odone battled cancer for some time and died of lung cancer on June 10, 2000, at the age of 61.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/13/us/michaela-odone-61-the-lorenzo-s-oil-mother.html?pagewanted=1 "Michaela Odone, 61, the 'Lorenzo's Oil' Mother Dies"] by Wolfgang Saxon, June 10, 2000, ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorenzo died the day after his 30th birthday. He was almost totally paralyzed but was, according to his father Augusto, "holding his own". He was unable to speak or move on his own. He communicated by wiggling his fingers and blinking his eyes. His mind was intact and he enjoyed music and having people read to him. "Certainly, he has good days and bad days, he is bedridden and he cannot eat more than through a tube… but his mind is still there. He likes that we read to him, that we play music for him and he knows who is around him".&lt;ref&gt;''New Scientist''&lt;/ref&gt; He lived with his father in Virginia and was cared for by nurses and his family friend, Oumouri Hassane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2062622/Obituary-Lorenzo-Odone.html|title=Obituaries: Lorenzo Odone |date=1 Jun 2008|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2010, two years after Lorenzo's death, Augusto Odone sold his home in Virginia and moved to [[Acqui Terme]] in his native Italy, near his father's village of [[Gamalero]] where he lived when he was young. He died there on 24 October 2013, at the age of 80, and was survived by the son and daughter from his first marriage, as well as a grandchild by his daughter [[Cristina Odone]].&lt;ref name="AugustoObit"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/10402968/Augusto-Odone.html Augusto Odone - Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
This severe form of adrenoleukodystrophy was first described by [[Ernst Siemerling]] and [[Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Siemerling E, Creutzfeldt HG |title=Bronzekrankheit und sklerosierende Encephalomyelitis |journal=Arch. Psychiat. Neurokrankh. |volume=68 |issue= 1|pages=217–44 |year=1923 |doi=10.1007/BF01835678}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lorenzo was diagnosed in 1984, using a new blood test that had been recently developed.  At the time, people diagnosed with the disease were usually young boys between 5 and 10 years old, who would gradually become mute, deaf, blind and paralysed before dying, which typically happened within two years due to aspiration or neurological causes.

Augusto and Michaela refused to accept this grim [[prognosis]], and fought to find a treatment for their son's fatal disease, clashing time after time with doctors, specialists, and support groups, some of whom were skeptical that two average citizens could produce a cure. With the help of [[Hugo Moser (scientist)|Hugo Moser]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Hugo Moser |url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/feb/21/guardianobituaries.obituaries |work=The Guardian |date= 2007-02-21 |quote=In truth, Hugo, who diagnosed Lorenzo back in 1984 as suffering with ALD, was too intellectually curious to dismiss Lorenzo's oil simply because it was the finding of two lay people |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and through long hours of research and study, the Odones, who had had no previous medical background, came up with a treatment. This treatment involved the consumption of a specially prepared oil, which became known as "[[Lorenzo's oil]]".&lt;ref name="pmid8196741"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Odone A, Odone M | title = More on Lorenzo's oil | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 330 | issue = 26 | pages = 1904–5 |date=June 1994 | pmid = 8196741 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199406303302615| url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Patients suffering from a related condition, adrenomyeloneuropathy, showed no clinical improvement after being treated with Lorenzo's Oil.&lt;ref name="pmid8350883"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aubourg P, Adamsbaum C, Lavallard-Rousseau MC, Rocchiccioli F, Cartier N, Jambaqué I, Jakobezak C, Lemaitre A, Boureau F, Wolf C | title = A two-year trial of oleic and erucic acids ("Lorenzo's oil") as treatment for adrenomyeloneuropathy | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 329 | issue = 11 | pages = 745–52 |date=September 1993 | pmid = 8350883 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199309093291101| url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&amp;pmid=8350883&amp;promo=ONFLNS19 | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Odones had an important role both in developing Lorenzo's oil and in setting up [[The Myelin Project]], which promotes and carries out research on ALD and other similar disorders. Michaela also insisted on continuing to treat her incapacitated son as a human being and not a "vegetable", helping him devise a means of communicating with her and others through the blinking of his eyes and the wiggling of his fingers.

==Cultural depictions==
The Odones' story was first depicted in the 1990 Italian television film ''[[Voglia di vivere]]'', starring [[Tomas Milian]] and [[Dominique Sanda]].&lt;ref name=vvv&gt;{{cite book|author=Augusto Odone|title=L'olio di Lorenzo. Una storia d'amore|publisher=Mondadori, 2011|isbn=8804611081}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later made into the 1992 film ''[[Lorenzo's Oil]]'', in which Augusto was played by [[Nick Nolte]] and Michaela by [[Susan Sarandon]], who through her involvement with the movie, became the spokesperson of the Myelin Project.

The 1994 episode of ''[[The Critic]]'' entitled "Dr. Jay", in which the main character Jay Sherman works to discover a cure for his boss' terminal disease was a send-up of the story.

A poem Michaela wrote about Lorenzo was set to music by [[Phil Collins]]. Titled "Lorenzo", it was featured on his 1996 album ''[[Dance into the Light]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genesis-path.net/more_PC.html Billboard on PC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613110608/http://genesis-path.net/more_PC.html |date=June 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12078">'''Beachcomber''' is a ''[[pen name|nom de plume]]'' that has been used by several journalists writing a long-running humorous column on the ''[[Daily Express]]''. It was originated in 1919 by [[John Bernard Arbuthnot|Major John Bernard Arbuthnot]] MVO as his signature on the column, titled ‘By the Way’. The name Beachcomber was then passed to [[D. B. Wyndham Lewis]] and, in turn, to [[J.B. Morton]], who wrote the column till 1975. It was later revived by [[William Hartston]], current author of the column.

=="By the Way" column==
"By the Way" was originally a column in ''[[The Globe (London)|The Globe]]'', consisting of unsigned humorous pieces; [[P. G. Wodehouse]] was assistant editor of the column from August 1903 and editor from August 1904 to May 1909, during which time he was assisted by  [[Herbert Westbrook]].&lt;ref&gt;''P.G. Wodehouse: A Portrait of a Master'', David A. Jasen, Music Sales Group, 2002, {{ISBN|0-8256-7275-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the ''Globe'''s closure, it was reestablished as a society news column in the ''Daily Express'' from 1917 onwards, initially written by social correspondent [[John Bernard Arbuthnot|Major John Arbuthnot]], who invented the name "Beachcomber".

After Arbuthnot was promoted to deputy editor, it was taken over sometime in 1919 by Wyndham-Lewis, who reinvented it as an outlet for his wit and humour. It was then passed to Morton during 1924, though it is likely there was a period when they overlapped. Morton wrote the column until 1975; it was revived in January 1996 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beachcomber lives again|date=5 January 1996|work=Daily Express|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues today, written by [[William Hartston]]. The column is unsigned except by "Beachcomber" and it was not publicly known that Morton or Wyndham-Lewis wrote it until the 1930s. The name is mainly associated with Morton, who has been credited as an influence by [[Spike Milligan]] amongst others. Morton introduced the recurring characters and continuing stories that were a major feature of the column during his 51-year run.

The format of the column was a random assortment of small paragraphs which were otherwise unconnected. These could be anything, such as:

* court reports, often involving Twelve Red-Bearded Dwarfs before Mr Justice Cocklecarrot.
* angry exchanges of letters between characters such as Florence McGurgle and her dissatisfied boarders.
* interruptions from "Prodnose", representing the public, who would then be roundly cursed by the author and kicked out.
* installments of serials that could stop, restart from earlier, be abandoned altogether or change direction abruptly without warning.
* parodies of poetry or drama, particularly of the extremely "literary" type such as [[Ibsen]].
* unlikely headlines, such as "SIXTY HORSES WEDGED IN A CHIMNEY", for which the copy in its entirety was "The story to fit this sensational headline has not turned up yet."
* news reports from around the country.
* or just anything that the author thought funny at the time.

Morton's other interest, [[France]], was occasionally represented by epic tales of his rambling walks through the French countryside. These were not intended as humour.

"By the Way" was popular with the readership, and of course, one of the reasons it lasted so long. Its style and randomness could be off-putting, however, and it is safe to say the humour could be something of an acquired taste.  Oddly, one of the column's greatest opponents was the ''Express'' newspaper's owner, [[Lord Beaverbrook]], who had to keep being assured the column was indeed funny. A prominent critic was [[George Orwell]], who frequently referred to him in his essays and diaries as "A Catholic Apologist" and accused him of being "silly-clever", in line with his criticisms of [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Hilaire Belloc]], [[Ronald Knox]] and Wyndham-Lewis. 

But ''By the Way'' was one of the few features kept continuously running in the often seriously reduced ''Daily Express'' throughout [[World War II]], when Morton's lampooning of [[Hitler]], including the British invention of bracerot to make the Nazi's trousers fall down at inopportune moments, was regarded as valuable for morale.

The column appeared daily until 1965 when it was changed to weekly. It was cancelled in 1975 and revived as a daily piece in the early 1990s. It continues to the present day in much the same format, but is now entitled "Beachcomber", not "By the Way".

==Recurrent characters==

*Mr. Justice Cocklecarrot: well-meaning but ineffectual [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|High Court judge]], plagued by litigation involving the '''twelve red-bearded dwarfs'''. Often appears in [[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]].
*Mrs. Justice Cocklecarrot: his wife.  Very silent, until she observes that "Wivens has fallen down a manhole". An enquiry from the judge as to which Wivens that would be elicits the response "E. D. Wivens". After a worrying interval she reveals that E. D. Wivens is a cat. His Lordship observes that [[cat]]s do not have initials. "This one does", says she.
*Tinklebury Snapdriver and Honeygander Gooseboote: two [[Barrister|counsel]].  The elbow of one has a mysterious tendency to become jammed in the jaws of the other. Honeyweather Gooseboote, surely?
*Twelve red-bearded dwarfs, with a penchant for farcical [[litigation]]. Their names "appear to be" Scorpion de Rooftrouser, Cleveland Zackhouse, Frums Gillygottle, Edeledel Edel, Churm Rincewind, Sophus Barkayo-Tong, Amaninter Axling, Guttergorm Guttergormpton, Badly Oronparser, Listenis Youghaupt, Molonay Tubilderborst and Farjole Merrybody.  They admit that these are not genuine names.  (Further red-bearded dwarfs, to the number of forty-one, appear in other litigation.)
*Captain Foulenough: archetypal cad and gatecrasher who impersonates the [[upper class]] in order to wreck their social events.  Educated at '''Narkover''', a school specializing in [[card game|card-playing]], [[horse-racing]] and [[bribery]]. His title of "Captain" is probably spurious;&lt;ref&gt;One story attributes it to the fact that he once commanded a canal barge.&lt;/ref&gt; but even if it had been a genuine military title, his use of it in civilian life, when at that time only officers who had achieved the rank of Major and above were allowed to do so, gives a subtle hint as to his nature.
*Mountfalcon Foulenough: his [[prig]]gish nephew, who brings havoc to Narkover and "makes virtue seem even more horrifying than usual".
*[[Ars longa, vita brevis|Vita Brevis]]: debutante frequently plagued by, but with a certain reluctant admiration for, Captain Foulenough.
*Dr. Smart-Allick: genteel, but ludicrous and [[criminal]], [[headmaster]] of Narkover.
*Miss Topsy Turvey: neighbouring [[headmistress]], courted by Smart-Allick.
*Dr. Strabismus (whom God preserve) of [[Utrecht]]: eccentric [[scientist]] and [[inventor]].
*Lord Shortcake: absent-minded [[Peerage|peer]] obsessed by his enormous collection of [[goldfish]].
*Mrs. McGurgle: [[Coast|seaside]] [[landlady]].  Fearsomely [[United Kingdom|British]], until she decides to reinvent her house as "Hôtel McGurgle et de l'Univers" to attract the [[tourist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;There is some inconsistency about her maiden name.  One [[correspondent]] calls her "Florrie Palmer as was", but the [[narrator]] says that she was a Gurricle, from Crabhampton.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ministry of Bubbleblowing: possible [[ancestor]] of [[Monty Python]]'s [[The Ministry of Silly Walks|Ministry of Silly Walks]].
*Charlie Suet: disastrous [[British civil service|civil servant]].
*Mimsie Slopcorner: his on-off girlfriend, an ill-informed and irritating social activist.
*The Filthistan Trio: Ashura, Kazbulah and Rizamughan, three [[Persian people|Persians]] from "Thurralibad", two of whom play see-saw on a plank laid across the third.  They have a series of contretemps with British [[bureaucracy]] and the artistic [[The Establishment|establishment]], in which the trio generally represents the voice of reason.
*Dingi-Poos: the Tibetan Venus.  She obtains desirable commercial contracts by using her charms to hoodwink visiting British [[diplomacy|envoy]]s, principally Colonel Egham and Duncan Mince.
*Big White Carstairs: [[John Buchan|Buchanesque]] [[Empire builder]], with a tendency to mislay his [[white tie|dress trousers]].
*O. Thake: naive, accident-prone [[Old Etonian]] and man-about-town.
*Lady Cabstanleigh: [[upper class|Society]] [[hospitality|hostess]].
*Stultitia: her niece, a [[playwright]].
*Boubou Flaring: glamorous but vacuous actress.
*Emilia Rustiguzzi: voluminous (both in bulk and in decibels) opera singer.
*Tumbelova, Serge Trouserin, Chuckusafiva: ballet dancers.
*Colin Velvette: ballet impresario.
*"Thunderbolt" Footle: handsome, socially celebrated boxer (who can do everything except actually fight)
*The M'Babwa of M'Gonkawiwi: African chief, who occasions great administrative problems in connection with his invitation to the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]].
*The Clam of Chowdah: oriental potentate
*Mrs. Wretch: formerly the glamorous circus performer Miss Whackaway, now wife to Colonel Wretch and "horrible welfare worker".
*Roland Milk: insipid poet (possible ancestor of [[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'s "[[E. J. Thribb]]").
*Prodnose: humourless, reasonable oaf who interrupts Beachcomber's flights of fancy. (The name is journalistic slang for a sub-editor; the broadcaster [[Danny Baker]] has appropriated it as his [[Twitter]] name.)

==Other media==
The [[Will Hay]] film ''[[Boys Will Be Boys (1935 film)|Boys Will Be Boys]]'' (1935) was set at Morton's [[Narkover]] school.

According to Spike Milligan, the columns had been an influence on the comedic style of his radio series, ''[[The Goon Show]]''.  

In 1969, Milligan based a BBC television series named ''[[The World of Beachcomber]]'' on the columns. A small selection was issued on a 1971 [[LP (format)|LP]] and a 2-cassette set of the series' soundtrack was made available in the late 1990s.

In 1989, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast the first of three series based on Morton's work. This featured [[Richard Ingrams]] as Beachcomber, [[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]] as Prodnose, [[Patricia Routledge]] and [[John Sessions]]. The compilations prepared by [[Mike Barfield]].  Series 1 was also made available as a 2-cassette set.

The '''Berlusconi II Cabinet''' was the 57th cabinet of the Italian Republic, and the first cabinet of the XIV Legislature. It took office following the [[Italian general election, 2001|2001 elections]], and held office from 11 June 2001 until 23 April 2005, a total of 1,412 days, or 3 years, 10 months and 12 days. It held office for the longest period in the history of the Republic, and for the second longest period in the history of unified Italy since 1861 (outlasted only by the Mussolini government). During its long tenure, its composition changed significantly. Following the poor performance of the centrist parties in the Italian regional elections of 2005, most of the ministers of the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] and the [[New Italian Socialist Party|Socialist Party - New PSI]] resigned from the government, which was succeeded by the [[Berlusconi III Cabinet]].

==Formation==
In 2001 Berlusconi again ran as leader of the centre-right coalition [[House of Freedoms]] ({{lang-it|La Casa delle Libertà}}), which included the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]], the [[Lega Nord|Northern League]], the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] and other parties. Berlusconi's success in the [[Italian general election, 2001|May 2001 general election]] led to him becoming Prime Minister once more, with the coalition receiving 45.4% of the vote for the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] and 42.5% for the [[Italian Senate|Senate]].

On the television interviews programme ''[[Porta a Porta]]'', during the last days of the electoral campaign, Berlusconi created a powerful impression on the public by undertaking to sign a so-called ''Contratto con gli Italiani'' ({{lang-en|[[Contract with the Italians]]}}), an idea copied outright by his advisor Luigi Crespi from the [[Newt Gingrich]]'s [[Contract with America]] introduced six weeks before the 1994 US Congressional election,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gingrich|first1=Newt|authorlink1=Newt Gingrich|last2=Armey|first2=Dick|authorlink2=Dick Armey|title=[[Contract With America]]: The Bold Plan|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was widely considered to be a creative masterstroke in his 2001 campaign bid for prime ministership. In this solemn agreement, Berlusconi claimed his commitment on improving several aspects of the Italian economy and life. Firstly, he undertook to simplify the complex tax system by introducing just two tax rates (33% for those earning over 100,000 euros, and 23% for anyone earning less than that figure: anyone earning less than 11,000 euros a year would not be taxed); secondly, he promised to halve the unemployment rate; thirdly, he undertook to finance and develop a massive new public works programme. Fourthly, he promised to raise the minimum monthly pension rate to 516 euros; and fifthly, he would suppress the crime wave by introducing police officers to patrol all local zones and areas in Italy's major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ricolfi|first=Luca|authorlink=Luca Ricolfi|title=Dossier Italia: a che punto è il 'contratto con gli italiani|publisher=Il mulino|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlusconi undertook to refrain from putting himself up for re-election in 2006 if he failed to honour at least four of these five promises.

The government obtained the confidence of the senate on 20 June 2001 with 175 votes in favour, 133 against and 5 abstentions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senato.it/japp/bgt/showdoc/frame.jsp?tipodoc=Resaula&amp;leg=14&amp;id=7804 Senato della Repubblica - XIV Legislatura - Seduta n. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Berlusconi wins senate confidence|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1398743.stm|accessdate=1 September 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=20 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies on 21 June 2001 with 351 votes in favour, 261 against and 1 abstention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legxiv.camera.it/chiosco.asp?sMacrosezione=Docesta&amp;source=&amp;position=Organi%20Parlamentari\L%27Assemblea\Resoconti%20dell%27Assemblea&amp;content=/_dati/leg14/lavori/stenografici/framedinam.asp?sedpag=sed006/s000r.htm Camera dei Deputati - XIV Legislatura - Seduta n. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition parties claim Berlusconi was not able to achieve the goals he promised in his ''Contratto con gli Italiani''. Some of his partners in government, especially the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] and the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] have admitted the Government fell short of the promises made in the agreement, attributing the failure to an unforeseeable downturn in global economic conditions. Berlusconi himself has consistently asserted that he achieved all the goals of the agreement, and said his Government provided ''un miracolo continuo'' (a continuous miracle) that made all 'earlier governments pale' (by comparison). He attributed the widespread failure to recognize these achievements to a campaign of mystification and vilification in the printed media, asserting that 85% of newspapers were opposed to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2004/e/sezioni/politica/campagna3/goveber/goveber.html|title=Berlusconi: 'Successi straordinari Contro di me l'85% dei giornali'|work=Repubblica|date=24 May 2004|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luca Ricolfi]], an independent analyst, held that Berlusconi had managed to maintain only one promise out of five, the one concerning minimum pension levels. The other four promises were not, in Luca Ricolfi’s view, honoured. In particular, the undertakings on the tax simplification and the reduction of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ricolfi|first=Luca|authorlink=Luca Ricolfi|title=Tempo scaduto.

==Fall==
[[House of Freedoms]] did not do as well in the 2003 local elections as it did in the 2001 national elections. In common with many other European governing groups, in the 2004 elections of the European Parliament, gaining 43.37% support. Forza Italia's support was also reduced from 29.5% to 21.0% (in the 1999 European elections Forza Italia had 25.2%). As an outcome of these results the other coalition parties, whose electoral results were more satisfactory, asked Berlusconi and Forza Italia for greater influence in the government's political line.

In the 2005 regional elections (3 April/4 April 2005), the [[centre-left]] gubernatorial candidates won in 12 out of 14 regions where control of local governments and governorships was at stake. Berlusconi's coalition kept only two of the regional bodies ([[Lombardy]] and [[Veneto]]) up for re-election. Three parties, [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]], [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] and [[New Italian Socialist Party|Socialist Party - New PSI]], threatened to withdraw from the Berlusconi government. The Italian [[Premier]], after some hesitation, then presented to the [[List of Presidents of the Italian Republic|President of the Republic]] a request for the dissolution of his government on 20 April 2005.

'''Cathy Corison''' is an [[United States|American]] [[winemaker]], entrepreneur and [[consultant]]. She specializes in [[Cabernet Sauvignon]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahsweeney/2012/10/31/entrepreneur-spotlight-on-corison-winery-founder-cathy-corison/#59c0eda26915|title=Entrepreneur Spotlight On... Corison Winery Founder Cathy Corison|last=Sweeney|first=Deborah|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corison was the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' Winemaker of the Year in 2011.

==Personal life and education==
Cathy Corison grew up in [[Riverside, California]].&lt;ref name=Bonne/&gt; She studied [[biology]] at [[Pomona College]] and was on their men's [[Diving (sport)|diving team]], because the school didn't have a women's team.&lt;ref name=Bonne/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baiocchi&gt;{{cite web|last=Baiocchi|first=Talia|title=Cathy Corison: The Female Clark Kent of Napa Cabernet|url=http://eater.com/archives/2011/03/29/cathy-corison-the-female-clark-kent-of-napa-cabernet.php|work=Vintage America|publisher=Eater|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, she had to take an extracurricular class. Using her diving skills she decided to sign up for a [[trampoline]] class, but changed her mind upon seeing a sign-up sheet for a [[wine tasting]] class.&lt;ref name=Bonne/&gt; This class was the catalyst for garnering Corison's interest in winemaking. After graduation in 1975, she moved to [[Napa Valley]] in [[California]].&lt;ref name=Bonne/&gt;&lt;ref name=Calwineries&gt;{{cite web|title=Cathy Corison|url=http://www.calwineries.com/learn/people-and-institutions/cathy-corison|work=People and institutions|publisher=Calwineries|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received her [[Master's degree]] in [[Enology]] from [[University of California, Davis]].&lt;ref name=Bonne/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baiocchi/&gt;

==Career==
Upon moving to Napa, she started working in the [[tasting room]] at [[Sterling Vineyards]] and at a [[wine shop]]. During this time, she was getting her Master's degree at the University of California, Davis. She was told by her professor that she would not get a job in Napa Valley because of being a woman. She tried to get a job at [[Freemark Abbey]] and was denied the job. Part of the reasons the owners gave was because she was too short and they believed she could not work in the [[wine cellar]]. She almost started working at [[Heaven Hill|Christian Brothers]] in the [[enology]] lab. 

As part of a larger pattern of sexism in the wine industry at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wine-searcher.com/m/2017/03/winemaker-opens-up-about-sexism|title=Winemaker Opens Up About Sexism {{!}} Wine News &amp; Features|last=Lawrence|first=James|date=2017-03-02|website=Wine Searcher|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; many women worked in labs and weren't allowed to be winemakers. Corison decided against working in the lab and in 1978 she became an [[intern]] at Freemark Abbey.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She eventually became a winemaker for the winery.&lt;ref name="Bonne" /&gt; She then joined [[Chappellet Winery]], in 1983, as head winemaker, working there for almost ten years.&lt;ref name="Calwineries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonne" /&gt; At Chappellet she was able to focus on developing her skills at creating Cabernet Sauvignon wines. She dislikes wines with high [[alcohol]] content and [[fruit forward]] wines.&lt;ref name="Calwineries" /&gt; She does not add additives of [[acids in wine|acids]] to her wine.&lt;ref name="Bonne" /&gt;

===Corison Winery===
She founded her own winery, Corison Winery, in 1987. The winery is located in [[St. Helena, California]] in a [[barn]] built by Corison's husband, William Martin.&lt;ref name=Bonne/&gt;&lt;ref name=Calwineries/&gt; Corison Winery makes Cabernet and [[Gewürztraminer]] wines and produces 3,500 cases a year. The winery makes a Kronos Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon and a Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. The Kronos is an [[estate wine]] and made from [[organic farming|organic]] grapes.&lt;ref name=Calwineries/&gt; The vineyard is [[dry farming|dry farmed]].&lt;ref name=Bonne/&gt; The grapes come from one of the oldest [[vineyard]]s in Napa Valley.&lt;ref name=Calwineries/&gt; The Napa Valley Cabernet comes from [[Rutherford, California|Rutherford]].&lt;ref name=Bonne/&gt; The Gewürztraminer is called Corazón and comes from the [[Anderson Valley AVA]].&lt;ref name=Calwineries/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Chris spent his early childhood in Hampshire and natural history was his main passion. He is the older brother of fashion designer [[Jenny Packham]].&lt;ref name="Asperger's and Me"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Chris Packham: Asperger's and Me |series=&amp;nbsp; |serieslink= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09b1zbb |accessdate=17 October 2017 |network=[[BBC Television]] |date=17 October 2017 |transcript=  |transcripturl=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He found his time at school very difficult, being socially excluded and regularly bullied by fellow pupils. In his teenage years, he was responsible for the care of a [[kestrel]], which he took from the wild and the death of which was a severe low point in his life.&lt;ref name="Asperger's and Me" /&gt; At university, he embraced the [[punk rock]] scene.&lt;ref name="Asperger's and Me"/&gt;

Packham has had [[Ménière's disease]] since his late 30s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/525496/Chris-Packham-brain-tumour-fear|title='My dizziness got so bad I feared it was a brain tumour,' says Chris Packham|first=Pat|last=Hagan|date=21 October 2014|publisher=Daily Express|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, at the age of 42, Packham began seeing a therapist after the death of his dog, Fish.

In 2009, during an interview with the ''[[Radio Times]]'', Packham suggested that the [[giant panda]] was too expensive to save and "should be allowed to become extinct" so that funds could be redistributed to protecting other animals and habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2009-09-22/chris-packham-let-pandas-die/|title=Radio Times - Autumnwathc's Chris Packham: Let Pandas Die|last=|first=|date=|website=Radio times|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a comment in 2008 saying he would "eat the last panda" if doing so would retroactively redistribute the money spent on panda conservation.

In 2009, 2014 and 2017, he criticised the TV show ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]'' for its mistreatment of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2009/dec/04/itv-television|title=The Guardian|last=|first=|date=4 December 2009|work=The Guardian|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/chris-packhams-open-letter-to-ant-and-dec-calling-for-end-to-i-m-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-9853650.html|title=The Independent - Chris Packham's Open Letter to Ant and Dec Calling For an End to I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here|last=|first=|date=11 November 2014|work=The Independent|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.msn.com/en-ie/entertainment/tv/chris-packham-slams-im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here/ar-BBFLZw6?li=AA5a2k|title=MSN - Chris Packham Slams I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here|last=|first=|date=27 November 2017|work=MSN Entertainment|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''The Daily Telegraph'' in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/wildlife/8070601/Chris-Packham-says-control-the-population-to-save-wildlife.html|title=The Daily Telegraph - Chris Packham says control the population to save wildlife|last=|first=|date=19 October 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Packham said that "The human population is sowing the seeds of a mass extinction event." In 2012, he expressed this view again in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/science/autumnwatch-chris-packham-on-why-over-population-is-biggest-1408733|title=The Mirror - We need to stop having so many kids|last=|first=|date=31 October 2012|work=The Mirror|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reiterated this in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.populationmatters.org/chris-packham-speaks-impact-population/|title=Population Matters.

In 2014, he self-funded a film crew to produce a series to highlight the mass killing of migrating birds by hunters in [[Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/04/stop-slaughter-of-wild-birds-malta-chris-packham|title=The Guardian - Why I'm fighting to stop the slaughter of Malta's wild birds|last=|first=|date=4 May 2014|work=The Guardian|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, he was arrested and charged with assault while filming on the Maltese island of [[Gozo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/19/chris-packham-charged-in-malta-after-confrontation-with-bird-hunters|title=the Guardian - Chris Packham charged in Malta after bird hunt confrontation.|last=|first=|date=19 April 2017|work=|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dismissed after video footage evidence was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4428032/Chris-Packham-appear-Malta-court-assault-charge.html|title=The Daily Mail - Revealed - Video footage that cleared wildlife presenter Chris Packham|last=|first=|date=20 April 2017|work=The Daily Mail|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Packham signed a letter to MPs to block the proposed changes to amend the [[Hunting Act 2004]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-urges-snp-to-abstain-from-vote-to-weaken-fox-hunting-ban-10386502.html|title=The Independent - Fox Hunting Ban: SNP says it will defeat Conservative plan to relax ban.|last=|first=|date=13 July 2015|work=The Independent|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked to raise awareness of the illegal persecution of raptors in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ww2.rspb.org.uk/community/ourwork/b/southwest/archive/2017/07/31/chris-packham-to-speak-out-against-illegal-persecution-of-birds-of-prey.aspx|title=RSPB - Chris Packham to speak out against the illegal persecution of birds of prey.|last=|first=|date=31 July 2017|website=RSPB|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned as President of the Hawk and Owl Trust in 2015 citing "Personal differences over ideas of policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.birdguides.com/news/hawk-and-owl-trust-lose-chris-packham-and-court-controversy/|title=Birdguides - Hawk and Owl Trust lose Chris Packham and court controversy|last=|first=|date=13 Feb 2015|website=Birdguides|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2015 Packham wrote an article in ''[[BBC Wildlife]]'' magazine complaining about the silence of many of Britain's leading conservation organisations on the issues of fox hunting, badger culling and hen harrier persecution. This elicited a public response from the [[Countryside Alliance]] calling for the BBC to sack him. Packham has been accused by the fieldsports community of exploiting his position as a very frequent presenter on the BBC to publicise his anti-shooting views; the BBC maintains that he is not employed by them, so is not bound by their impartiality rules. The BBC has required him to attend regular reviews to ensure that his behaviour is appropriate, but the Corporation refuses to release any information about the content or outcome of these reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/07/countryside-alliance-bbc-sack-chris-packham|title=The Guardian - Countryside Alliance urges BBC to sack Chris Packham in conservation row|last=|first=|date=7 September 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christiane Völling''' is the first [[intersex]] person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention&lt;ref name="raab" /&gt; described as a non-consensual sex reassignment.&lt;ref name="icj2" /&gt; She was awarded €100,000 by the Regional Court of Cologne.&lt;ref name="raab"&gt;{{Cite web| last = [[Zwischengeschlecht]]| title = Nuremberg Hermaphrodite Lawsuit: Michaela "Micha" Raab Wins Damages and Compensation for Intersex Genital Mutilations!| format = text| accessdate = 2015-12-21| date = December 17, 2015 | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/Nuremberg-Hermaphrodite-Lawsuit-Damages-and-Compensation-for-Intersex-Genital-Mutilations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Völling was born in 1959 with [[XY sex-determination system|XX sex chromosomes]], typically associated with being female, and likely also with [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].&lt;ref name="ethikrat"&gt;{{Cite web|publisher = [[German Ethics Council]]|title = Christiane Völling|date = 2010|url = http://diskurs.ethikrat.org/christiane-volling/ |accessdate = 2015-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She had ambiguous genitalia and was assigned and raised male. She had an early puberty with what was considered to be striking physical growth, including beard growth.&lt;ref name="icj1"&gt;{{Cite web|last = [[International Commission of Jurists]]|title = In re Völling, Regional Court Cologne, Germany (6 February 2008) |accessdate = 2015-12-27|url = http://www.icj.org/sogicasebook/in-re-volling-regional-court-cologne-germany-6-february-2008/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an appendectomy, at age 14, the teenager was found to have a full set of female reproductive organs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://zwischengeschlecht.org/pages/Hermaphrodite-wins-damage-claim| title= Christiane Völling: Hermaphrodite wins damage claim over removal of reproductive organs | publisher = [[Zwischengeschlecht]] | date = August 12, 2009 | accessdate = 15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including ovaries and fallopian tubes. While no testicular tissue was detected, Völling was diagnosed as having a mix of both male and female organs. She was informed of the presence of female organs and told she was 60% female. Völling suffered mental health issues as a consequence. Her female-typical chromosomal pattern was detected in 1977, but the results were not shared with her. Her awareness of her sexuality and her sexual orientation were analysed, followed by surgery at age 18 on 12 August 1977 that removed her female sexual organs, including her reproductive organs. Medical papers showed purpose of the surgery as a "testovarectomy", the removal of both testicular and ovarian tissue, however, no testicular tissue was present.&lt;ref name="icj1" /&gt; The senior physician’s entry stated  “a normal female anatomy with pre-pubertal uterus, normal sized ovaries, blindly ending vagina...” were found.&lt;ref name="köln"&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Regional Court Cologne| last = Regional Court Cologne| title = Re: Völling| location = Cologne| date = 2008-02-06| url = http://icj.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/In-re-Volling-Regional-Court-Cologne-Germany-English.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Völling continued to live as a man for a time, but later transitioned to live as a woman. In 2006, Völling obtained her medical records and discovered the concealment of her chromosomal diagnosis, and the nature of the surgery in 1977.&lt;ref name="icj1" /&gt;

== The case of Re: Völling ==
In a case decided on 6 February 2008, in the Regional Court of Cologne, Völling stated that she had been unable to consent to, or fully understand, the nature of the surgery that took place in 1977. She argued that, with appropriate medical treatment, she could have lived the life of a woman, including full female sexuality and the ability to procreate. In addition to life in an inappropriate gender, she suffered the consequences of castration, and of a urethra reconstruction, including persistent urinary tract infections and urinary dysfunction.

The surgeon argued that he relied on the diagnostic support of medical specialists. He further argued that Völling did not possess a "naturally female body", but one subjected to [[virilization]], and "profoundly atrophied" sex organs."&lt;ref name="köln" /&gt; In the surgeon's view, the surgery fulfilled the urgent and thoroughly reviewed wishes of the patient. Key diagnostic information was withheld for therapeutic reasons, primarily due to concern about her mental health.

The court determined&lt;ref name="köln" /&gt; that the surgery took place in the absence of any grave or acute health risks. The doctor had no good reason for failing to provide full diagnostic information, in particular as the diagnostic data showed that Völling did not possess mixed sex characteristics, with the potential to maintain one present sex, but actually involved the complete removal of her only present sex organs. Völling was both genetically and physically female. An obligation to inform the patient about her diagnoses could not be disregarded for therapeutic reasons as the "surgery's point of origin considerably changed during the surgery".

The court ruled that "the Defendant illegally, in a deliberate and culpable manner, injured the Plaintiff’s health by removing his female sex organs" without full consent about the nature, content and extent of the surgery.&lt;ref name="köln" /&gt; Völling was awarded costs of €100,000.&lt;ref name="raab" /&gt;

The [[International Commission of Jurists]] describe the case as "an example of an individual who was subjected to sex reassignment surgery without full knowledge or consent".&lt;ref name="icj2"&gt;{{Cite web|last = International Commission of Jurists|title = SOGI Casebook Introduction, Chapter six: Intersex |accessdate = 2015-12-27|url = http://www.icj.org/sogi-casebook-introduction/chapter-six-intersex/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case fell just within limits afforded by the [[statute of limitations]].&lt;ref name="dw" /&gt;

In addition to the reparations case, Völling had to petition a court for her official change of name and change of legal status from male to female.&lt;ref name="dw"&gt;{{Cite web| last = DW Staff| title = German Gender-Assignment Case Has Intersexuals Hopeful |publisher = [[Deutsche Welle]] |date = 12 December 2007|work = DW.COM|accessdate = 2015-12-21|url = http://www.dw.com/en/german-gender-assignment-case-has-intersexuals-hopeful/a-3000902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Croatian diaspora''' refers to the [[Croats|Croatian]] communities that have formed outside [[Croatia]]. 
Estimates on its size are only approximate because of incomplete statistical records and [[naturalization]], but (highest) estimates suggest that the Croatian diaspora numbers between a third&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrt.hr/arhiv/hrvati_u_svijetu/upoznajte_hrvatsku/09_hrvati_u_svijetu/hrv_u_svijetu.html|title=Hrvati u svijetu|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040629224715/http://www.hrt.hr/arhiv/hrvati_u_svijetu/upoznajte_hrvatsku/09_hrvati_u_svijetu/hrv_u_svijetu.html|archivedate=29 June 2004|language=Croatian|publisher=[[Croatian Radiotelevision]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a half&lt;ref name="HWC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crowc.org/english/about.asp?subcat=general|title=About Us|work=Croatian World Congress|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015203556/http://crowc.org/english/about.asp?subcat=general|archivedate=15 October 2007|quote=...4.5 million Croats and people of Croatian heritage live outside of the Republic of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina...}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the total number of Croats.

More than four million Croats live in Croatia. The largest community outside Croatia are the [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], one of the [[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|constitutient nations]] of that country, amounting to about 750,000.

The Croatian diaspora outside Croatia and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] amounts to close to a million elsewhere in [[Europe]], and to about 1.5 million overseas. The largest overseas community is reported from the [[Croatian American|United States]] and [[Croats of Chile|Chile]], with about 400,000 members.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In Western Europe, the largest group is found in Germany. The German census reports  228,000 [[Croatian German|Croats in Germany]] {{as of|2006|lc=y}}, but estimates of the total number of people with direct Croatian ancestry (including [[German nationality law|naturalized German citizens]]) range as high as 450,000.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina==
{{main|Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
[[Image:Croatians from Bosnia.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Bosnian Croats celebrating a religious Mass (1901)]]

Croats form one of the three [[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|constitutient nations]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They are frequently referred to as Bosnian Croats, but since the [[War in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] the number of Herzegovinian Croats exceeds the number in Bosnia. The Croats maintain an unofficial capital in [[Mostar]], with the city being home to the largest Croatian population.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

There is no precise data regarding Bosnia and Herzegovina's population since the last war.  The UNHCR conducted an unofficial census in 1996, but the data has not been recognized. Ethnic cleansing within Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s saw the vast majority of Croats move and take up residence in the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It is estimated that there are approximately 600,000 Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to 2000 data from the [[CIA World Factbook]], Bosnia and Herzegovina is ethnically 14.3% Croat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bk.html CIA World Factbook: Bosnia and Herzegovina] 14.3% of a total population of 4,613,414 (July 2009 not including "Refugees and internally displaced persons" because they put Bosnian Croats together with other types.&lt;/ref&gt;

Croatians in Detroit first appeared around 1890, settling usually in the region of Russel. In [[Illinois]] the Croatians started concentrating mostly around Chicago. Although it was created a bit later, the Croatian settlement in Chicago became one of the most important ones in the United States. The settlement especially started developing after World War I and Chicago became the center of all Croatian cultural and [[political]] activities. It is calculated that there were roughly 50,000 Croats in Chicago in the 1990s, while there were altogether 100,000 Croats living in 54 additional [[Croats|Croatian]] settlements in Illinois. There is a significant Croat population also in [[Indianapolis]] that settled during the Yugoslav Wars of the 90's.

Pittsburgh has always had a sizeable [[Croatian people|Croatian population]]. The headquarters of the [[Croatian Fraternal Union]] (CFU) - the oldest and largest Croatian organization in the United States - is located in the eastern suburb of Monroeville, PA, established in 1880's. The CFU publishes a weekly newspaper "The Zajednicar Weekly" in both English and Croatian. Most of the Croatians in [[Pittsburgh]] originally settled in the early 1900s on the city's North Side. A neighborhood centered on East Ohio Street along the Allegheny River between Millvale and the North Shore was named Mala Jaska after an area in Croatia (northwest of Zagreb).

===Canada===
{{main|Croatian Canadian}}
Croatians reportedly immigrated to Canada as early as 1541 when two Croatians from Dalmatia served on the crew of Jacques Cartier's third voyage to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/croatians/|title=Croatian Canadians|last=Rasporich|first=Anthony W.|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately 114,880 [[Canadians]] of Croatian ethnic origin as reported in the 2011 National Household Survey.

The Croatian community is present in most major Canadian cities (including [[Toronto]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ottawa]], [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], and [[Montreal]], as well as [[Mississauga]] and [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]]) in the form of designated Croatian churches, parks, and other organizations. 

Notable Croatian Canadian organizations include the [[Croatian Fraternal Union]], the Croatian Canadian Folklore Federation (Vancouver), and the Croatian Canadian Cultural Centre (Calgary). Some of the more popular Croatian Canadian events are the [[Croatian-North American Soccer Tournament]] and the [[Canadian-Croatian Folklore Festival]]. Croatian Canadians have had a notable presence in the form of soccer teams all around Canada, one of the most famous clubs was the now defunct [[Toronto Metros-Croatia]], who are succeeded by [[Toronto Croatia]].

'''[[Croats]]''' are an important ethnic group in [[Chile]]; they are citizens of Chile who were either born in Europe or are Chileans of Croatian descent deriving their [[Croats|Croatian]] ethnicity from one or both parents. Chile has one of the largest communities of ethnic [[Croats]] outside the [[Balkans|Balkans Peninsula]] and it is one of the most significant communities in the [[Croatian people|Croatian diaspora]] - second only to that which is found in the United States. They are one of the main example of successful assimilation of a non Spanish-speaking European [[ethnic]] group into Chilean society. Many successful entrepreneurs, scientists, artists and prominent politicians holding the highest offices in the country have been of Croatian descent.

The Croatian community first established itself in two provinces situated in the extreme ends of [[Chile]]: [[Antofagasta]], in the [[Atacama]] desert of the north and [[Punta Arenas]] in the [[Patagonia]]n region in the south. The massive arrival of Croats in Chile began in 1864 and the migration grew steadily until 1956 – reaching a number of more than 60,000.&lt;ref name="Croacia y Chile: DUBROVNIK, EL ÚLTIMO BALUARTE"&gt;{{cite web|title= Croacia y Chile: DUBROVNIK, EL ÚLTIMO BALUARTE|publisher=hrvatskimigracije.es.tl|date=2008-04-10|url=http://hrvatskimigracije.es.tl/Croacia-y-Chile.htm?PHPSESSID=36d25ef77c698e5bfe8d0f7257c3e71c|accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is officially accepted that there are up to 400,000 [[Croatian Chilean|Chileans of Croatian descent]] (who clearly identify themselves as Chilean-Croats).&lt;ref name="croata"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrvatskimigracije.es.tl/Diaspora-Croata.htm|title=www.Hrvatskiimigracije.es.tl - Diaspora Croata|website=hrvatskimigracije.es.tl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the number may be much higher with some [[demographic]] analysts estimating a figure of 750,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrvatski.cl/html/croatas.htm|title=Croatian settlement of Chile|language=es|work=Croatian Embassy in the Republic of Chile|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215204611/http://www.hrvatski.cl/html/croatas.htm|archivedate=December 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
{{main|Croatian Argentine}}
[[Image:Monumento al Inmigrante, Rosario 1.jpg|thumb|right|160px|A statue honoring the immigrants, in [[Rosario]].]]
Argentine of Croatian descent number over 250,000.&lt;ref name="croata"/&gt; The most successful of all the Croats in Argentina was also almost the first to arrive. Nikola Mihanović came to [[Montevideo|Montevideo, Uruguay]] in 1867. Having settled in [[Buenos Aires]], by 1909m Mihanović owned 350 vessels of one kind or another, including 82 steamers, owning, in that time, the biggest boat company in Argentina. By 1918, he employed 5,000 people, mostly from his native [[Dalmatia]] which was then under [[Austro-Hungarian]] and Italian rule. Mihanović by himself was thus a major factor in building up a Croat community which remains primarily Dalmatian to this day, although it contains people from other Croatian regions.

The second wave of Croat immigration was far more numerous, totalling 15,000 by 1939. Mostly peasants, these immigrants fanned out to work the land in [[Buenos Aires province]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], [[Chaco Province|Chaco]] and [[Patagonia]]. This wave was accompanied by a numerous clergy to attend their spiritual needs, especially [[Franciscans]].

If the first two waves had been primarily economic, the third wave after the Second World War was eminently political. Some 20,000 Croatian political refugees came to Argentina, and most became construction workers on Peron's public works projects until they started to pick up some Spanish. Today, many descendants of the Croatian immigrants still know Croatian, although different than the modern-day Croatian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/casamirror/easteurope.htm|title=Redirect easteurope|website=myweb.tiscali.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
The Croatian community is present in most major Colombian cities, including [[Bogota]], [[Cali]] and [[Barranquilla]]. There are approximately 5,800 [[Colombians]] of Croatian ethnic origin as reported.

===Venezuela===
{{main|Croatian Venezuelans}}
Croatian immigration to Venezuela dates back to the late nineteenth century, and was characterized by the individual arrival of merchant seamen. Until [[World War I]], a few number of Croats settle in Venezuela, nevertheless it is in the period of the [[World War II]] when the Croatian families that escaped from the [[President of Yugoslavia|government of Tito]] begin to settle in the country. Most of these immigrants came from present-day Croatian territory, particularly from the coastal and inland areas of [[Dalmatia]]. Others came from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Banko|first1=Catalina|title=A shelter in Venezuela: the immigrants from Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania and Bulgary|journal=Tiempo y Espacio|volume=26|issue=65|url=http://www.scielo.org.ve/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1315-94962016000100005|accessdate=23 January 2017|publisher=SciELO|language=Spanish|issn=1315-9496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the members of the Croatian community settled in [[Caracas]] and [[Valencia, Venezuela|Valencia]] and, to a lesser extent, in other cities of the interior: [[Maracay]], [[Maracaibo]], [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]] and in localities of the [[Yaracuy]] state, where some joined the work in the sugar industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arandia|title=Los croatas en Venezuela y la medicina natural|url=http://vozdecroacia.hrt.hr/nuestras-noticias/individual-noticias/croacia-hoy-magazin/croacia-hoy-magazin-2016-02-14/|website=Hrvatska radiotelevizija|accessdate=23 January 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also, several forest technicians arrived that later contributed to the establishment of the School of Forestry Engineering at the [[University of the Andes, Venezuela|University of the Andes]]. A large percentage of the Croatians were artisans, who later became small entrepreneurs, and many were professionals, especially engineers and technicians, who had outstanding performance in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ministerio de Agricultura y Cría (1936-1958)|title=Memoria|date=1960|location=Caracas|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{main|Croatian Australian}}
[[Croatia]] has been a source of [[Immigration|migrants]] to Australia, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s. In 2006 118,051 persons resident in Australia (0.6%) identified themselves as having a [[Croatian people|Croatian ancestor]].

Croatian people are visible in all parts of Australian society, but they have made a big impact in the sporting arena with many football clubs being formed by immigrants, two of the more famous and most successful are [[Melbourne Knights FC]] and [[Sydney United]] both clubs having played in the Australia's top league the [[National Soccer League|NSL]] and Melbourne Knights winning the championship back to back in the season 1994/5 and 1995/6. [[Sydney United]] have the honour of the club who has produced the largest number of full Australian internationals.

Some famous Australia-Croatian football players to represent Australia are [[Mark Viduka]], [[Jason Čulina]], [[Mark Bresciano]], [[Zeljko Kalac]], [[Josip Skoko]], Tony Popoviċ all who ironically lined up against Croatia in the 2006 World Cup in Germany, playing against Australian-born Croatian international [[Josip Šimunić]].

===New Zealand===
{{seemain|Croatian New Zealander}}
The first Croat to settle in [[New Zealand]] is believed to be Pauvo Lupis (Paul) who deserted his Austrian ship in the late 1800s.
Although Croats had contact with New Zealand and a few had settled the proper [[Human migration|migration]] waves began when the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] allowed Italian wine and oil into the Empire's territories for a substantially less duty thus rendering peasants and farmers bankrupt, this treaty was the beginning of many events which causes migration mainly from [[Dalmatia]] .

5,000 between 1890 and 1914, prior to World War I.
1,600 during the 1920s before the onset of the Great Depression.
600 in the 1930s, prior to World War II.
3,200 between 1945 and 1970.
Arrivals during the 1990s, fleeing the [[Yugoslav Wars|conflict in former Yugoslavia]].

The main destination for settlers was the [[Northland Region|Northland]] gum fields where the young boys were sent to dig [[Kauri]] tree gum from swamps which until the 1950s was used to varnish wooden furniture and the likes. Here on these fields, as outcasts by the British Empire and called 'Austrians' because of the passport they carried they were looked at with suspicion. Mainly because they worked hard and fast in a gang rather who would share profits and send money back to their villages in [[Dalmatia]]. Many British settlers who worked the same fields resented the Dalmatian gum-diggers, whom they nicknamed "Dallies", a term which is still occasionally used. On these fields as outcasts, they [[Croats|Croatian]] immigrants were thrown together with the other outcasts, the native [[Māori people]] who having many of the same view points and coming from villages themselves got on extremely well.

Many Croatian men married Māori women as they came to New Zealand as bachelors before a bride could be sent from their home village. The local [[Māori people|Maori]] called them ''[[Tarara (Croatian New Zealander)|Tarara]]'' because they spoke in [[Hrvatski|Croatian]] very fast. Many Māori nowadays refer to themselves as Tarara and carry Croatian family names. Miss New Zealand 2010 [[Cody Yerkovich]] (spelled in Croatian as Jerković) is an example of the Māori Croatian mix Tarara.

In Modern times Croatian immigrants have continued to arrive, with many starting their own business with the abundance of good soil and land many turned to similar work that they did back in [[Dalmatia]] such as vineyards, orchards and fishing. Some notable companies in wine are Delegat, Nobilo, Selak, Villa Maria, Montana and Kuemue River Wines, all owned by Croatian families.

In fishing there are two big companies, the first Talley's Seafood founded in 1936, by Ivan Peter Talijancich (spelled Talijančić in Croatian) established Talley's in [[Motueka]], New Zealand. The second being Simunovich (spelled Šimunović in Croatian) Fisheries Limited which has thrived and become a large company from the deep sea Scampi.

In sport many small clubs and associations have come and gone, but [[Central United]] formerly Central Croatia SC formed in 1962 is still going to this day. The football club, formed by a group of young Croatian immigrants from Dalmatia, played initially in the lower division of the Northern League before rising to become one of New Zealand's top football clubs by the late 1990s.

Central United FC were the New Zealand champions in 1999, 2001 and were runner-up in 1998. Central United FC also won the Chatham Cup in 1997, 1998, 2005 and 2007 and were runners-up in 2000 and 2001. Their home ground is at [[Kiwitea Street|Kiwitea Street Stadium]], in [[Sandringham, New Zealand|Sandringham]] ([[Auckland]]).

Some notable former players are:

*[[Chris Zoricich]] - scored a free kick vs USA at Confederations cup.
*[[Ivan Vicelich]] - New Zealand's most capped international.
*[[Luka Bonačić]] -Ex [[Hajduk Split]] player and coach.

Other notable New Zealanders of Croatian descent include singer [[Lorde]] (real name Ella Yelich-O'Connor), historian [[James Belich (historian)|James Belich]], golfer [[Frank Nobilo]], rugby player [[Frano Botica]], motor racing drivers [[Robbie Francevic]] and [[Paul Radisich]], tennis player [[Marina Erakovic]], architect [[Ivan Mercep]], artist [[Milan Mrkusich]], and musicians [[Peter Urlich|Peter]] and [[Margaret Urlich]].

'''Danilo Mainardi ''' (25 November 1933 – 8 March 2017) was an Italian [[ethologist]], scholar, and writer.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Milan]], the son of [[Enzo Mainardi]], he graduated in 1956 in biology in [[Parma]]. From 1967 to 1992 he taught [[zoology]], and then biology and [[ethology]] at the [[University of Parma]], in the Science and Medicine faculties. From 1973 he directed the School of Ethology of the Scientific cultural center [[Ettore Majorana]] in [[Erice]].

He taught Ethology of Behaviour at the [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]].

He was national president of [[LIPU]] (Lega italiana protezione uccelli, Italian League for the defence of birds, founded in 1965 and Italian partner of [[Birdlife International]]), and later became its honorary president.

Mainardi studied the [[social behavior|social]] and sexual behaviour of animals, and its evolution, starting from the relationships between parents and offspring (particularly the importance of the "[[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]]"). His studies demonstrate that also the animals can transmit - to a certain extent - the capacity to transfer solution to problems from one individual to another: the process of innovation according to Mainardi's results is not exclusive of mankind.

He directed the ''Italian Journal of Zoology'', organ of the Italian Zoological association (Unione Zoologica italiana). Besides his researches and teachings, he was most popular in Italy as a regular and appreciated guest at various  scientific TV programs, such as ''Dalla parte degli animali'' (On the animals' side), and the scientific series ''[[Quark]]'', the first show of the kind in Italy aimed at a general public, created in 1991 by Italian journalist [[Piero Angela]]. Since the beginnings, Mainardi was a regular contributor to "Quark", cooperating with Piero Angela to spread the interest for the scientific matters, making a point in using the simplest possible language even for complex subjects, to reach every spectator.

He was an atheist, and president of [[Union of Rationalist Atheists and Agnostics]].

Mainardi also contributed to several Italian major newspaper, such as the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', and has written more than 200 publications and books.

'''Denholm Mitchell Elliott''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (31 May 1922 – 6 October 1992) was an English actor, with more than 120 film and television credits.&lt;ref name="Screen Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/452513/index.html|title=British Film Institute Biography|accessdate=24 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his well-known roles include the abortionist in ''[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]'' (1966), [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Marcus Brody|Marcus Brody]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981) and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989), Coleman in ''[[Trading Places]]'', (1983), and Mr. Emerson in ''[[A Room with a View (1985 film)|A Room with a View]]'' (1985).

Elliott earned critical acclaim in his later career. He was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance in ''A Room with a View'' and won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role]] in three consecutive years in the 1980s, becoming the only actor ever to have achieved this. The American film critic [[Roger Ebert]] described him as "the most dependable of all British character actors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roger Ebert |title=Roger Ebert's Four Star Reviews 1967-2007|year=2008|page=655|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=978-0740771798}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' called him "a star among supporting players" and "an accomplished scene-stealer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/07/obituaries/denholm-elliott-actor-70-dies-a-star-among-supporting-players.html | title= Denholm Elliott, Actor, 70, Dies; A Star Among Supporting Players | work=The New York Times | location=New York | first=Bruce | last=Lambert | date=7 October 1992 | accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Elliott was born in London, the son of Nina (née Mitchell) and Myles Layman Farr Elliott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/51023|title = The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myles was a barrister who had read law and Arabic at Cambridge before fighting with the [[Gloucestershire Regiment|Glosters]] at Gallipoli and in Mesopotamia. In 1930 Myles Elliott was appointed solicitor-general to the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandatory Government in Palestine]]. Three years later, following a series of controversial government prosecutions, he was assassinated outside the [[King David Hotel]] and buried in the [[Mount Zion Cemetery, Jerusalem|Protestant Cemetery on Mount Zion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary Neil Elliott|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1427451/Neil-Elliott.html|accessdate=5 September 2016|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=14 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Elliott's  elder brother Neil was [[land agent]] to [[Lady Anne Cavendish-Bentinck]].

Elliott attended [[Malvern College]] and trained at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] in London. He was asked to leave the academy after one term. As Elliott later recalled, ''They wrote to my mother and said, "Much as we like the little fellow, he's wasting your money and our time. Take him away!"''&lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio. Desert Island Discs, 14 September 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Second World War]], he joined the [[Royal Air Force]], training as a  wireless operator/air gunner and serving with [[No. 76 Squadron RAF]] under the command of [[Leonard Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Encyclopædia Britannica| url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9000778/Denholm-Elliott|accessdate=24 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of 23/24 September 1942, his [[Handley Page Halifax]] DT508&lt;ref name="lost360"&gt;[http://www.lostaircraft.com/database.php?mode=viewentry&amp;e=360 Record for Halifax DT508], LostAircraft.com&lt;/ref&gt; bomber took part in an air raid on the [[U-boat]] pens at [[Flensburg]], Germany. The aircraft was hit by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|flak]] and subsequently ditched in the [[North Sea]] near [[Sylt]], Germany. Only Elliott and two crewmen survived, and he spent the rest of the war in a [[prisoner of war]] camp in [[Silesia]]. While imprisoned, he became involved in amateur dramatics.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last= Falconer| first= Jonathon| title=The Bomber Command Handbook 1939–1945|year=1998|publisher=Sutton Publishing|location=[[Stroud]]|isbn=978-0-7509-1819-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After making his film debut in ''[[Dear Mr. Prohack]]'' (1949), he went on to play a wide range of parts, often ineffectual and occasionally seedy characters, such as the drunken journalist Bayliss in ''[[Defence of the Realm]]'', the criminal abortionist in ''[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]'', and the washed-up film director in ''[[The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (film)|The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz]]''.  Elliott and [[Natasha Parry]] played the main roles in the 1955 [[television play]] ''[[The Apollo of Bellac]]''.&lt;ref name=times&gt;"Giraudoux Play On Television 'The Apollo Of Bellac'", ''[[The Times]]'', 13 August 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; He took over for an ill [[Michael Aldridge]] for one season of ''[[The Man In Room 17/The Fellows (Late of Room 17)|The Man in Room 17]]'' (1966)

Elliott made many television appearances, which included plays by [[Dennis Potter]] such as ''[[Follow the Yellow Brick Road]]'' (1972), ''[[Brimstone and Treacle]]'', (1976) and ''[[Blade on the Feather]]'' (1980). He starred in the BBC's adaptation of [[Charles Dickens]]'s short story ''[[The Signalman (film)|The Signalman]]'' (1976).

In the 1980s he won three consecutive [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA) awards—Best Supporting Actor for ''Trading Places'' as [[Dan Aykroyd]]'s kindly butler, ''[[A Private Function]]'', and ''[[Defence of the Realm]]''—as well as an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for ''A Room with a View''. He also became familiar to a wider audience as the well-meaning but addlepated [[Marcus Brody|Dr. Marcus Brody]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981) and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. A photograph of his character appears in  ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', and a reference is made to Brody's death. Also, a statue was dedicated to Marcus outside Marshall College, the school where Indy teaches. In 1988 Elliott was the Russian [[mole (espionage)|mole]] Povin, around whom the entire plot revolves, in the television miniseries ''[[Codename: Kyril]]''.

Having filmed [[Michael Winner]]'s ''[[The Wicked Lady (1983 film)|The Wicked Lady]]'' (1983), Elliott was quoted in a [[BBC Radio]] interview as saying that [[Marc Sinden]] and he "are the only two British actors I am aware of who have ever worked with Winner more than once, and it certainly wasn't for love. But curiously, I never, ever saw any of the same crew twice." (Elliott in ''You Must Be Joking!'' (1965) and ''The Wicked Lady'' and Sinden in ''The Wicked Lady'' and ''[[Decadence (film)|Decadence]]''). Elliott had worked with Sinden's father, Sir [[Donald Sinden]], in the film ''[[The Cruel Sea (1953 film)|The Cruel Sea]]'' (1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/8309346/Michael-Winner-The-life-Ive-lived-the-girls-Ive-had...-its-been-incredible.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|author=Woods, Judith|title=Michael Winner: 'The Life I've Lived, the Girls I've Had... Ht's Been Incredible'|date=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He co-starred with [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Harold Gould]] in the television film ''[[Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry]]'' (1986) and with [[Nicole Kidman]] in ''[[Bangkok Hilton]]'' (1989).

In 1988 Elliott was appointed a commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) for his services to acting. His career included many stage performances, including with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], and a well-acclaimed turn as the twin brothers in [[Jean Anouilh]]'s ''[[Ring Round the Moon]]''. His scene-stealing abilities led [[Gabriel Byrne]], his co-star in ''Defence of the Realm'', to say: "Never act with children, dogs, or Denholm Elliott."&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-denholm-elliott-1555931.html|title=Obituary: Denholm Elliott|work=The Independent|date=7 October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being described by [[British Film Institute]]'s [[Screenonline]] as an actor of "versatile understanding and immaculate technique,"&lt;ref name="Screen Online"/&gt; Elliott described himself as an instinctive actor and was a critic of [[Stanislavski's system]] of acting, saying, "I mistrust and am rather bored with actors who are of the Stanislavski school who think about detail."&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-10-07/news/mn-473_1_denholm-elliott|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|work=articles.latimes.com|publisher=Los Angeles Times|title=Denholm Elliott; Veteran Character Actor|date=7 October 1992|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Privately [[bisexual]],&lt;ref name=Susan&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1549209/Susan-Elliott.html|title=Susan Robinson Elliott obituary|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=24 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elliott was married twice: first to actress [[Virginia McKenna]] for a few months in 1954, and later, in an [[open marriage]], to [[United States|American]] actress Susan Robinson (7 March 1942 – 12 April 2007), with whom he had two children, Mark and Jennifer. Jennifer commited suicide in 2003.&lt;ref name=Susan/&gt;

===Death===
Elliott was diagnosed with [[HIV]] in 1987&lt;ref name=Susan/&gt; and died of [[AIDS]]-related [[tuberculosis]] at his home in [[Santa Eulària des Riu]] on [[Ibiza]], Spain, on 6 October 1992 at the age of 70. Tributes were paid by actors Sir [[Donald Sinden]] and Sir [[Peter Ustinov]], playwright [[Dennis Potter]], and former wife Virginia McKenna. Sinden said, "He was one of the finest screen actors and a very special actor at that. He was one of the last stars who was a real gentleman. It is a very sad loss." Ustinov said, "He was a wonderful actor and a very good friend on the occasions that life brought us together." Potter commented: "He was a complicated, sensitive, and slightly disturbing actor. Not only was he a very accomplished actor, he was a dry, witty, and slightly menacing individual. As a man, I always found him very open, very straightforward and very much to the point." McKenna added: "It is absolutely dreadful, but the person I am thinking of at the moment more than anybody is his wife. It must be terrible for her."&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/denholm-elliott-dies-from-aidsrelated-tb-aged-70-1556004.html|title=Denholm Elliott dies from AIDS-related TB, aged 70|work=The Independent|date=7 October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ismail Merchant]] described Elliott as "an all-giving person, full of life ... He had an affection and feeling for other actors, which is very unusual in our business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1992/scene/people-news/oscar-nominee-elliott-dies-of-aids-problems-101433|title=Oscar nominee Elliott dies of AIDS problems|work=Variety|date=7 October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His widow set up a charity, the Denholm Elliott Project, and collaborated on his biography.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Susan; Turner, Barry (1994). ''Denholm Elliott: Quest for Love''.&lt;/ref&gt; She worked closely with the [[UK Coalition of People Living with HIV and AIDS]]. Susan Robinson Elliott died on 12 April 2007, aged 65, in a fire in her flat in London.&lt;ref name=Susan/&gt;

'''Ebba Lund''' (22 September 1923 – 21 June 1999) was a [[Danish resistance movement|Danish Resistance fighter]] during [[World War II]] and a scientist.

== Resistance work ==
Lund began her resistance work in 1942, two years after the German invasion of Denmark. Her work initially consisted of publishing illegal underground newspapers with her sister.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|date=2011 |isbn=9781556529610 |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lund worked for ''Frit Danmark,''the most popular clandestine newspaper.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

When the Danish government was dissolved and Nazi Germany took over, Lund joined [[Holger Danske (resistance group)|Holger Danske]], a sabotage-oriented Resistance group.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|date=2011 |isbn=9781556529610 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first task was to procure fishing boats to take Jews to Sweden. Safe houses were set up for Jews until they could safely be taken to Sweden, and Lund's own house was used  as a safe house.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; During her rescue operations, Lund became known as the Girl with the Red Cap or Red Riding Hood because of the red hat she woreto signal the Jews to be escorted to look for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|date=2011 |isbn=9781556529610 |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Resistance did not only aid Jewish individuals, however; they also assisted defecting German soldiers and other Resistance members.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/28/world/danes-commemorate-rescue-of-jews-from-nazis.html|title=Danes Commemorate Rescue of Jews From Nazis|date=28 September 1993|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holger Danske group helped save 700-800 Jews in only a few weeks by offering means of escape.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Atwood|first=Kathryn J.|title=Women Heroes of World War II|location=Chicago|publisher=Chicago Review Press|date=2011 |isbn=9781556529610 |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lund herself had a hand in about 500 of these missions.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Lund managed to escape arrest because, at a time when many of her fellow Resistance workers were being arrested, she was hospitalized with blood poisoning. In 1944, Lund became pregnant and withdrew entirely from Resistance work.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibliotek.science.ku.dk/life150/forskere/ebba-lund/|title=Ebba Lund|first=Knud|last=Høgsberg|date=31 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
After the war, Lund studied [[chemical engineering]] and [[immunology]]. She did important research on the [[polio]] virus in response to a polio epidemic in Denmark at the time.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Lund became the head of the Department of Virology and Immunology at the [[Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University]] in Copenhagen.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; She was the first female professor at this institution at the time.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Lund was an incredibly prolific scientist; she published 124 works in her lifetime, including 84 in English, as well as a lecture series and other content.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

In 1975, Lund became a [[Knight of the Dannebrog]] and in 1984 was appointed to knight in the first degree.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; In 1985, Lund received the Ebbe Muncks Award for her service in the Resistance.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

Lund died in 1999.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

'''François Capois ''' (or '''François Cappoix'''; 1766 &amp;ndash; October 8, 1806, [[nickname]]d '''Capois-La-Mort''', also '''Cappoix-la-Mort''', meaning "Capois-Death") was a Haitian officer in the [[Haitian Revolution]] (1791–1794) for independence from France.

He was born in [[Port-de-Paix]], [[Saint-Domingue]] on the island of [[Hispaniola]], on the plantation of Laveaux/Lapointe. His name was a transformation of the name ''cappouet'', owner of the plantation.

==Military career==
His military career began in 1793 after a visit with independence leader [[Toussaint Louverture]] at [[Port-de-Paix]]. Then under the colonel [[Jacques Maurepas]] he was a member of the 9th brigade. His rank in the army changed quickly, first to Lieutenant, then to Captain of the 3rd Battalion. He participated under general [[Jacques Maurepas]] against all expeditions and invasions in the [[Nord-Est (department)|north-eastern]] region of the island. Capois is mostly known for his extraordinary courage and especially his [[herculean]] bravery at the [[Battle of Vertières]] in which the French general [[Vicomte de Rochambeau|Viscount of Rochambeau]], commander of [[Napoleon]]'s army in [[Saint-Domingue]] (colonial Haiti), even called a brief cease-fire to congratulate him.

=== Capturing of Port-de-Paix and Tortuga Island===
After receiving new troops from France, [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]] dispatched General Clauzel against [[Port-de-Paix]] which Capois was forced to evacuate, but the fearless black general redeemed his defeat by storming the ''Petit-Fort'' where he captured the ammunition, of which he was in great need. After his success at ''Petit-Fort'', he decided to attack [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]] island (''Île de la Tortue''). The most difficult problem he had in this attack was how to reach this island without ships. He made up for this lack by building a raft consisting merely of planks held together by lianas. 

On the night of February 18, 1803, 150 soldiers under the command of Vincent Louis were huddled together on this frail means of transportation in tow of 2 rowboats. They fell unexpectedly on the garrison of Tortuga and for a while seemed to be the conquerors. But the French, who soon got over their surprise, rallied and defeated Vincent Louis, who succeeded in making his escape with some of his companions. The unfortunate blacks who were taken prisoner by the French were tortured to death in expiation of the audacious attempt. 

The failure did not discourage the energy of Capois. On April 12, 1803, Capois stormed  [[Port-de-Paix]], and soon after, Vincent Louis on his raft was again on his way to [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]]. He succeeded this time in taking possession of the island, which the French never recovered.&lt;ref name="Léger"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jacques Nicolas Léger |authorlink=Jacques Nicolas Léger |title=Haiti, Her History and Her Detractors |year=1907 |publisher=The Neale Pub. Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Vertières===
{{main|Battle of Vertières}}
On November 18, 1803, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] had ordered Capois to take Vertières, a fort situated upon a mount. Capois-la-Mort advanced with a demi-brigade which, horribly mutilated, soon recoiled before the cannon fire coming from the fort. He led it back for a second time, but was again driven to the bottom of the hill by the mitrailleuse. 

Boiling with rage, Capois ran to seek other new troops and, mounting his horse, advanced for the third time; again the thousand deaths that vomited from the fortress repulsed him and his brigade. Now for the fourth time, he asked his  men to follow him by saying "Forward! forward!". While he was at the head of his men, his horse was hit by a cannonball—he fell, but Capois took his sword, got up, and ran to place himself again at the head of his black soldiers by shouting "Forward! Forward!" His cap, garnished with plumes, was carried away by a shot. He replied to the insult which left him hatless by drawing his sword and again throwing himself into the assault. 

Observing this, [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]] and his men shouted: "Bravo! bravo! bravo!" The firing in the fort ceased. Suddenly, the battle was still. A French staff officer mounted his horse and rode toward the intrepid Capois-la-Mort. With a great voice he shouted: "General Rochambeau sends compliments to the general who has just covered himself with such glory!" Then he saluted the Haitian warriors, returned to his position and the fight resumed. 

The next morning, a French officer followed by his companions led to the headquarters of the Haitian army a horse caparisoned, and delivered him with these words: "The Captain-general (Rochambeau) offers this horse as a mark of admiration to the "black [[Achilles]]" to replace the one of his that the French army regrets having killed."&lt;ref name="Léger"/&gt;

==Death==
On October 8, 1806, Capois was on his way to [[Cap-Haïtien]] when, near [[Limonade]], he rode into a trap set for him, and was killed by assassins on the orders of [[Henri Christophe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Petit Goâve |author=Nemours Rigaud |page=157 |publisher=L'Action sociale |year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Gilbert de la Hay''' (died April 1333), fifth feudal baron of [[Errol, Perth and Kinross|Errol]] in Gowrie, was [[Lord High Constable of Scotland]] from 1309 (hereditary in 1314).

The health of American author [[Robert E. Howard]] (1906–1936), especially his mental health, has been the focus of the biographical and critical analysis of his life. In terms of physical health, Howard had a weak heart which he treated by taking [[digitalis]].  The precise nature of Howard's mental health has been much debated, both during his life and following his suicide.  Three main points of view exists.  Some have declared that Howard suffered from an [[Oedipus complex]] or similar mental disorder.  Another viewpoint is that Howard suffered from [[major depressive disorder]].  The third view is that Howard had no disorders and his suicide was a common reaction to stress.

==Physical health==
Howard had a weak heart, which was treated by taking [[digitalis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lord|1976|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first indication of this problem came when, while working with an oil-field surveyor in the period before he became a successful author, Howard passed out in the heat.  A later diagnosis confirmed that his heart had a mild tendency to race under stress and he was told that a heavy blow to his chest could be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lord|1976|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (13th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 1933 Howard was involved in a traffic accident.  Driving back from a football game in Brownwood with three friends in the mist and rain, he crashed into a flag pole in [[Ranger, Texas|Ranger]].  A piece of windshield cut his neck close to the [[jugular vein]] and he was forced heavily into the steering column.  This impact to his chest could have been lethal with his heart problems but he escaped with just bruised ribs.  None of the other passengers were seriously injured either and one escaped injury altogether. The town helped to pay for repairs to the car and the flag pole was eventually removed following further accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lord|1976|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (40th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health==
[[Image:Reh moustache.jpg|right|thumb|150px|alt=Robert E. Howard with a moustache, wearing a broad brimmed hat.|Late photograph of Robert E. Howard, with moustache.]]
In the years since his suicide, there has been a lot of speculation about Robert E. Howard's mental health.  Even during his life, others in Cross Plains thought of him as crazy or odd.  Some have suggested that he had an [[Oedipus complex]], others have found evidence for [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]], and others still have diagnosed him as being mentally healthy.  His act of suicide is often the basis of these opinions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (55-56th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost all speculation is in the form of amateur-psychoanalysis from people with no qualifications in the field.&lt;ref name="Burke 56"&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (56th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gramlich 2006 99 106" /&gt;

===Eccentric behavior===
The people of Cross Plains considered Howard to be an odd person and possibly "crazy".  Cross Plains was mainly used to blue-collar agricultural and oil field work, as well as professions such as a teacher or doctor; they were not used to some who only wrote all day.  From their perspective, Howard did not seem to be doing any work at all.  His neighbors even complained about the noise he made typing, as well as loudly reading his own narration as he did so, throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard displayed eccentric behavior, such as: having his pants hemmed short so he would not trip in a potential fight; carrying a gun in his car in case of enemies; shouting stories as he wrote them; dressing oddly for the time and place, including a large moustache and sombrero; shadow-boxing as he walked down the street.  At the time, Novalyne Price told her roommate, "He’s trying to tell people he’s a writer and writers have a right to be odd. Since they think he’s crazy, anyway, he’ll show them just how crazy he can be."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (56th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of his break-up with Novalyne Price, Howard's behavior became increasing eccentric.  On one occasion, having taken Novalyne to a drug store for a soda, he loudly and publicly re-told his story "[[Red Nails]]."  He changed his appearance and grew a large, drooping mustache.  Later he began to wear about town a black [[sombrero]] with red bandana and black [[cowboy|vaquero]] pants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Charles Gramlich's opinion on Howard's behavior is that these are either normal acts or just eccentricities, which does not extend to having a mental disorder. The carrying of gun is, in Gramlich's opinion, normal for Texas, especially in the 1930s when the Wild West was within recent, living memory. The story about needing the gun in case of "enemies," given to E. Hoffmann Price, may have just been a tall tale invented by Howard for his friend. Novalyne Price considered Howard's talk of enemies to be part of an act. Finn notes that [[Highwayman|highwaymen]] had operated in the area during the oil boom and this was the reason Howard gave to Price for the gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|pp=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shadow-boxing and shouting out of stories as they were written were due to Howard being a writer and simply getting caught up in a story. Other acts were intentionally eccentric as a reaction to the criticism from other townspeople. He was expressing his anger to this criticism by acting in a contrary manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|pp=102–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possibility of depression===
Howard maintained in correspondence with other writers that he was a failure and a [[Hack writer|hack]].  This was despite being commercially successful, sought after by publishers and receiving fan mail for his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When sending condolences to [[August Derleth]] in May 1936, the month before his suicide, Howard wrote "Death to the old is inevitable, and yet somehow I often feel that it is a greater tragedy than death to the young...I don't want to live to be old.  I want to die when my time comes, quickly and suddenly, in the full tide of my strength."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[E. Hoffmann Price]] visited Howard in early 1934.  His impression on leaving was "Bob lived in a dream world people by enemies, and by peers and other folks who downgraded him."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=179–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard suffered from nightmares and sleep walking into his early twenties, probably as a result of stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=99, 222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In spring 1926, Howard went to Brownwood to see Tevis Clyde Smith.  In the night Clyde Smith was woken by Howard's scream; he saw him wrestle with a large shape and fall through a closed window.  The family found him wandering outside in a daze.  Clyde Smith talked to him until he went back to sleep, on prior instructions, and then woke him.  Howard had apparently dreamed that he saw a newspaper with the headline "Axe Murderer Slays Three."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Howard went to a hospital in [[Temple, Texas|Temple]] complaining of a [[varicocele]], gas in the stomach and an abnormally small penis. The working diagnosis at the time was [[Neurasthenia|sexual neurasthenia]] but the symptoms may instead point towards [[neurotic depressive disorder]]. The doctor concluded that "We do not think there is anything wrong with Robert.  We can find no varicocele of any consequence, and his organs are normally developed and he tests out good in every respect.  His trouble, in our judgment, is due to his thinking there is something wrong.  After he has dispelled this thought from his mind he will be in fine shape."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer Mark Finn suggests that Howard picked up on his mother's depression.  She was dying of tuberculosis and may have suffered a miscarriage in October 1907.  Howard's father's job as a country doctor required him to make long journeys away from home, which would often mean him spending the night elsewhere.  This frequently left Howard alone with his mother and later put him in the role of primary caregiver.  The situation may have been exacerbated by frequent moves during his youth, which prevented Howard making many friends of his own during his early years, and the gradual breakdown of his parents' marriage.  His life was not his own and he developed a hatred of authority and any control placed over him.  He rebelled by boxing and drinking but, nevertheless, he felt duty-bound to remain and look after his mother.  Even after he became a success as a writer, he continued to live with his parents; although this was not unusual at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=218–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finn writes that "Robert was [[Major depressive disorder|clinically depressed]] by any definition applicable, and had been for many years.  Whether the cause of the depression was a chemical imbalance, an untenable situation at home, or a combination of the two is not important."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; His suicide, once his duty to his mother was done, may have been an act of finally asserting control over his own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possibility of an Oedipus complex===
[[L. Sprague de Camp]] wrote in ''The Science Fiction Handbook'' (1953) that "the neurotic Howard suffered from an Oedipean devotion to his mother and... from delusions of persecution."  Faced with refutations from Glenn Lord, de Camp eventually stopped making claims about an Oedipus Complex but maintained that Howard was insane, especially due to Howard's suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=239–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lot of the speculations about Howard's mental state appear to originate in the first, flawed, biography of Howard, ''[[Dark Valley Destiny]]'' by L. Sprague de Camp and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These tend to be from a Freudian perspective and suggest an Oedipal attraction between Robert and his mother Hester, based on the facts that Howard took care of his dying mother, that his bedroom had a window through to his parents' bedroom and that he killed himself on the day she was going to die herself.  Gramlich points out that Dr. Isaac Howard's job forced him to take house calls and be away on business while Robert E. Howard's job as a writer meant he was at home most of the time; so, naturally, Robert became the primary caregiver.  Howard's bedroom was a converted porch and the window was a pre-existing part of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|pp=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possibility of no mental disorders===
Dr. Charles Gramlich, a professor of psychology and an author of fantasy fiction, believes that Howard had no mental disorders and that amateur psychoanalysis has only come to such a conclusion through cherry-picking of evidence from Howard's life.&lt;ref name="Gramlich 2006 99 106"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|pp=99, 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Burke concurs that almost all speculation is in the form of amateur psychoanalysis from people like L. Sprague de Camp with no qualifications in the field.&lt;ref name="Burke 56" /&gt;

===Suicide===
Confidants such as [[Tevis Clyde Smith]] and [[Novalyne Price Ellis]] found Howard to be an agreeable companion most of the time, full of life and good humor — but always with an underlying simmering melancholy.  Smith noted that Howard first mentioned suicide in October 1923 when a classmate, Roy Guthrie, committed suicide.  It affected Howard and he increasingly defended the right to do so in later years.  Howard may have considered suicide as early as 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Howard first talked of his own death in 1928 when his dog Patch was dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Novalyne Price was admitted to hospital in 1935, her doctor, a friend of Howard's father, asked her if Howard had ever talked about not wanting to live after his mother died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Howard's suicide, Gramlich believes it was nothing to do with any long-term mental abnormality; it was a common reaction to the strain he was under at the time.  While Howard did talk of suicide during his life, statistics show that one out of three teenagers contemplate suicide and the details of Howard's are normal (white, single, from the south of the United States, with a gun).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|pp=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the moment of Howard's death, he was mentally and physically exhausted with little available support: he was caring for his dying mother as her condition got worse; he was not being paid the money owed to him by ''Weird Tales'', at a time when he needed it for his mother's healthcare bills; he was working increasingly harder to make the money through other markets; his relationship with Novalyne Price had recently broken down; Tevis Clyde Smith had recently married and moved away; he did not have a strong relationship with his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gramlich ends by saying "He wasn't crazy; he was just a very good writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (56th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

David Hayles wrote in the Times: "Maybe, at the end of it all, Howard felt that he had done what he needed to do. The prolific writer, whose 160-plus published stories were full of men facing death on their own terms, wanted to do the same. In a letter to the fantasy writer August Derleth he stated: 'I don’t want to live to be old. I want to die when my time comes, quickly and suddenly, in the full tide of my strength and health.' Youthful bravado perhaps, but he was true to his word. He wrote about men who didn’t age — his heroes were immortal. In bowing out in his prime, so was Robert E. Howard."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hayles|2009|loc=Saturday Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jamal al-Husayni''' (1894-1982) ({{lang-ar|جمال الحُسيني}}) was born in [[Jerusalem]] and was a member of the highly influential and respected  [[Husayni]] family.&lt;ref name="Friedman2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Isaiah Friedman|title=British Pan-Arab Policy, 1915-1922: A Critical Appraisal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yJ9dFmK7qBwC&amp;pg=PA294|accessdate=22 December 2012|year=2010|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-1074-6|pages=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yad Vashem Studies"&gt;{{cite book|title=Yad Vashem Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcDXaeukt4sC&amp;pg=PA130|accessdate=22 December 2012|year=2007|publisher=Wallstein Verlag|pages=130|issn=0084-3296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Husayni served as Secretary to the Executive Committee of the [[Palestine Arab Congress]] (1921–1934) and to the [[Muslim Supreme Council]]. He was co-founder and chairman of the [[Palestine Arab Party]], established in [[Jerusalem]] in 1935, and in 1937 became a member of the first [[Arab Higher Committee]], led by [[Amin al-Husayni]], later becoming its chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/personalities/alpha_h.htm|accessdate=2012-12-22|title=H - Personalities - Bio &amp; Photos|date=2007-08-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CJF0qBzA?url=http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/personalities/alpha_h.htm|archivedate=2012-11-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. p.134&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936-39 Arab revolt]] he escaped first to [[Syria]] (1937) and then to [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] (1939). He led the Arab delegation to the [[London Conference (1939)|1939 London Conference]] and was Palestinian representative to the [[Anglo-American Committee of Enquiry]]. Husayni was arrested by the British in 1941 and exiled to [[Southern Rhodesia]]. He was released at the end of [[World War II]] and returned to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1946. He was an unofficial delegate to the [[United Nations]] in 1947-48. In September–October 1948 he was the foreign minister in the Egyptian-sponsored [[All-Palestine Government]].

== Youth ==
Husayni was born in 1894&lt;ref name="Cohen. p.207"&gt;Cohen. p.207&lt;/ref&gt; into the [[Husayni]] family, one of the most influential families in Jerusalem. He went to the [[Church of England]] school, [[St. George's Cathedral, Jerusalem|St Georges]], where he was the first pupil to wear western style clothes and where he became an enthusiastic player of the new sport – [[Association football|football]]. On finishing his secondary education, aged eighteen, he entered the [[American University of Beirut|Syrian Protestant College]] in [[Beirut]] to study medicine. At that time the Medical faculty was alive with debate about the status of [[Arabs]] under a [[Young Turk Revolution|Government]] based in [[Istanbul]] and dominated by [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. Jamal became a member of the ''[[Nadi Al-Arabi]]'' and ''[[al-Muntada al-Adabi]]'' movements in 1918-19&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/personalities/alpha_h.htm Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6CJF0qBzA?url=http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/personalities/alpha_h.htm |date=2012-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, according to Isaac Friedman,&lt;ref name="Friedman2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Isaiah Friedman|title=British Miscalculations: The Rise of Muslim Nationalism, 1918-1925|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_g_ZI46xncC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=6 June 2012|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-4749-0|pages=62–63–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
were "hostile to British rule and who wanted to reinstate Turkish rule in the former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Nadi Al-Arabian Asiatic provinces."  
During the time of Jamal's membership, ''al-Muntada al-Arabi'' were committed to the concepts of [[pan-Arabism]] and [[anti-Zionism]] and supported a new [[Greater Syria|Greater Syrian nation]] under [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]]. In May 1919 this political activity was such that the  British government prohibited any further meetings, speeches, or public activities by the club.&lt;ref name="Robson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Robson|title=Colonialism and Christianity in Mandate Palestine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Y0CqJjN2O0C&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=10 January 2013|date=1 September 2011|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-72653-6|pages=39–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1914, two years into Jamal's studies, Ottoman Turk guards raided the college arresting anyone suspected belonged to a secret Arab nationalist organization, and Jamal fled to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915 four of Jamal's fellow-members of the [[Beirut]] branch of the ''al-Muntada al-Arabi'' were hanged for treason by [[Djemal Pasha]].&lt;ref&gt;Antonius. p.108&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|First World War]] he was conscripted into the [[Fourth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Turkish Army]] and later taken prisoner by the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force|British]].&lt;ref&gt;Pappe.pp.149,150&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamal and his peer group moved in elite Palestinian circles. His relative, [[Haj Amin al-Husseini|Amin]] was to become head of the [[Supreme Muslim Council]]. His brother-in-law, [[Musa Alami]], worked in the British administration and rose to become personal secretary to the High Commissioner. Musa's wife was the daughter of [[Ihsan al-Jabri]] one of the Arab delegates to the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Teveth, BG and the Arabs. p.130 : 'cousin and confidant of the Mufti' (Jamal)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later his young cousin [[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni|Abd al-Qadir]] was to become a Palestinian military leader fighting the British in [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936-39]] and the emerging Israelis in [[1948 in Mandatory Palestine|1948]].

== 1920s ==

By 1921, aged 27, he had become a senior figure in Palestinian politics. His uncle, [[Musa al-Husayni|Musa Kazim]], an Ottoman administrator and under the British, briefly, Mayor of [[Jerusalem]], was chairman of the Executive Committee of the [[Palestine Arab Congress]] formed by the [[Muslim-Christian Associations]], which had been established following the arrival of the British. Jamal was appointed Secretary to the Executive.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. p.227. His mother was Musa Kazim's sister.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jamal and Musa Kazim were at this time considered the foremost representatives of the Palestinian Arab community.  Following the disturbances of 1921, also known as the [[Jaffa Riots]], Jamal had a meeting with the High Commissioner, [[Sir Herbert Samuel]], and issued a statement calling for calm.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. pp.218,219&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 6th Congress in 1923 he was one of the delegates calling for a [[Tax resistance|tax strike]], demanding Arab representation in the administration. The proposed strike was abandoned in the face of opposition from the major land owners who dominated the Congress. Instead it chose to boycott proposed elections for a Legislative Council and in June all the Arab members of the British Advisory Council resigned their positions.&lt;ref&gt;Kayyali. pp.118-120&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period the British regarded him as reasonable and pragmatic. In 1923 he made an extended visit to India and met many [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim leaders]].&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. pp.225,227&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 he met with [[Jewish Agency]] member [[Haim Kalvarisky]] to present proposals for the structure of a Legislative Council. It would have two chambers, the lower would be elected with the High Commissioner having power of veto over its decisions. The upper chamber would consist of ten members selected on a communal basis with two of the members representing the Jewish community. Immigration would be controlled by a commission. These proposals were rejected by the Jewish Agency.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. p.228&lt;/ref&gt; But by this time Jamal had become disillusioned with the Executive Committee and had to be persuaded to keep his position as Secretary. One of his complaints was lack of funds for administration.&lt;ref&gt;Kayyali. p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as his political activities Jamal also pursued a career as an advocate. In 1927 he petitioned the High Court for the removal of the Hebrew letters 'EI' from the newly issued Palestine stamps. The two letters, followed the word 'Palestine' in Hebrew and stood for Eretz Israel - “[[Land of Israel]]”. The petition was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Segev. p.299&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, just prior to the rioting over Zionist activity at the [[1929 Palestine riots|Wailing Wall]], the deputy High Commissioner, [[Harry Luke|H.C. Luke]], organised a lengthy meeting between Arab and Jewish Agency leaders in attempt to calm the situation. The Arab delegation was led by Jamal. The hoped for joint statement did not materialize.&lt;ref&gt;Segev. pp. 311-312&lt;/ref&gt; Following the riots, in October, he was leader of a delegation sent to London for meetings at the [[Colonial Office]]. This was in his capacity as Secretary to the [[Supreme Muslim Council]], an organisation which had been set up by the British, and was led by [[Haj Amin al-Husseini|Hajj Amin Husseini]], to whom he was related both through his father and mother. It was the first Palestinian Arab delegation to go to London since 1922 and included [[Adil Arslan]] and [[Izzat Tannous]]. One of its objectives was the setting up of an information center in London.&lt;ref&gt;Kayyali. p.148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. p.345. something like: Jamal is Amin's grandfather's nephew.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen. p.196&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1930s ==

At the end of 1930 Jamal had further meetings in London with British officials who liked his conciliatory approach. He agreed to proposals for a round table conference with members of the [[Jewish Agency]]. His one condition was that the Jewish delegates should come from Palestine and specifically that Weizmann should not be a member since this would be an act of recognition of validity of Zionist claims over Palestine. He returned to Palestine, in January 1931, feeling progress had been made.&lt;ref&gt;Kayyali. p.161&lt;/ref&gt; At this time he was also active as a journalist. In 1933 he published a series of anonymous articles in the Damascus newspaper ''Alif Ba'' in which he accused [[Awni Abd al-Hadi]], leader of the new [[Independence Party (Palestine)|Independence Party]], ''Istiqlal'', of selling 40,000 [[Dunam|dunum]] of land in [[Wadi al-Hawarith|Wadi Hawarith]] to the Jewish Agency six years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Khalidi. p.89&lt;/ref&gt; A 1937 Jewish Agency list has Jamal's name as having acted as an attorney in a similar land sale.&lt;ref&gt;Segev. p.275&lt;/ref&gt; It is an indication of how much information the Jewish Agency was collecting. Another example is a file which records discussions at an Executive Committee meeting, 12 April 1933, at which the imminent meeting, organised by [[Haim Arlosoroff]], between [[Chaim Weizmann]] and leaders from [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] was discussed. The notes indicate that Jamal argued that the committee had no influence over tribal leaders east of the Jordan and that the meeting should be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen. p.254&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1934 the Executive Committee called for demonstrations against government policy. The authorities responded by arresting Jamal al-Husayni whom they held responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. p.166&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1935 he launched the [[Palestine Arab Party]], ''Al Hisb Al-Arabi Al Falastini'' to represent the Husseini power bloc. The party was not the first mass-membership Palestinian Arab political party. It had been preceded by ''Istiqlal'' (1932) and the [[National Defence Party (Palestine)|National Defence Party]], ''Hazb al-defa al Watany'', (1934) as Palestinian Arabs began organising themselves into political parties after the decline of the National Congress and the [[Muslim-Christian Associations]].&lt;ref name="Cohen. p.207"/&gt; The party had offices in all the major Arab towns with a program calling for opposition to Zionism and the Mandate, Arab unity and an end of land sales to the Jewish Agency.&lt;ref&gt;Kayyali. pp.177,178&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1935 Jamal attended a memorial ceremony for [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]] in Haifa, and made a speech to the crowd of 6,000 in which he predicted that al-Qassam would become a symbol of Palestinian resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. p.270&lt;/ref&gt; Following the crushing of the al-Qassam insurgency the [[Arthur Grenfell Wauchope|Wauchope]] administration put forward new proposals for a legislative council coupled with restrictions on land sales. The Jewish Agency swiftly rejected the proposals while the Palestinian Arab Party did not reject them completely until April 1936 several months after they had been blocked by the United Kingdom's Houses of Parliament. The party appeared to be in closer touch with public opinion when, in 1936, it declined an invitation to talks with the Colonial Office in London which the other parties had accepted. A week later, on 21 April 1936, the party announced its support for the [[Palestinian general strike|General Strike]]. Four days later the [[Arab Higher Committee|Higher Arab Committee]] was formed from the leadership of all the main factions. Hajj Amin was chairman and [[Awni Abd al-Hadi]] was secretary. One of the Committee's priorities was an end to Jewish immigration. Jamal later replaced Hadi as secretary following Hadi's internment at [[Sarafand al-Amar|Sarafand]] military base in June 1936. At the same time a four-man delegation, including Jamal, were given visas to go to London for meetings at the [[Colonial Office]] to find a way of ending the strike. It is suggested that Jamal was forced to take a harder line than he wished due to pressure from more radical elements. The talks failed.&lt;ref&gt;Kayyali. pp.187-88,190-91,194-96&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 October 1937 the authorities banned all Palestinian Arab nationalist organisations and Jamal went into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Abcarius. p.197&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 Jamal, with his [[Pan-Arab]] views, was advocating the dispersal of the Jews in Palestine across an independent, federated Arab World. Jamal had some contact with the pacifist president of Jerusalem's [[Hebrew University]], [[Judah Leon Magnes|Judah Magnes]], and was possibly involved in proposals that Magnus presented to [[David Ben Gurion]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Teveth. p.157&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 Jamal's brother in law, Musa Alami, held a series of meetings with Magnus at which a number of proposals were outlined, but neither Ben Gurion nor Jamal were willing to publicly endorse them.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen. p.272&lt;/ref&gt; The move was overtaken by the strike and the establishment of the [[Arab Higher Committee]]. Zionist archives record an Arab source saying that Jamal was the only member of the committee who would not accept bribes. [[Sharett]], head of the Jewish Agency Political Department, is quoted as saying that Jamal, and his cousin Hajj Amin, were the only honest Palestinian leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen. pp.272,275&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, following the end of the general strike, Jamal attempted to open negotiations with American Zionists with the help of the [[Brit Shalom (political organization)|Beth Shalom]] group. His priority was to limit the number of Jews arriving in Palestine and to end land sales to Jewish organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. p.279&lt;/ref&gt; In Jerusalem he edited a newspaper called ''al-Liwa''.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. p.285&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 he set up an information office in [[Damascus]] which received some funds from the local German and Italian Consulates.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. p.289&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, within Palestine the British and the Jewish Agency were funding 'Peace Bands' to combat the rebel's successes. During this period his proposals included pledges of equal rights for Jews in any future Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Kayyali. p.213 (n.226)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 he led the Arab delegation to the [[London Conference (1939)|London Conference]] following the failure of which the British Government announced its plans for the future of Palestine in a [[White Paper of 1939|White Paper]] which included plans for a limit to Jewish immigration. By this time Jamal had become far more outspoken: “The Jews have turned Palestine into hell.”&lt;ref&gt;Segev. pp. 407,408&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of the Second World War ended all diplomatic activity related to Palestine and the British proposals were quietly shelved.

== After 1940 ==

In 1940 he and [[Haj Amin al-Husseini|Amin al-Husayni]] moved to [[Baghdad]] where he held two weeks of meetings with [[S.F. Newcombe|Colonel Stewart Newcombe]]. Following these meeting both Jamal and Musa al-Alami agreed to the terms of the White Paper and both signed a copy of it in the presence of the Prime Minister of Iraq [[Nuri as-Said]].&lt;ref&gt;Buheiry. p.177&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, following the collapse of the [[1941 Iraqi coup d'état|Rashidi revolt]], he was amongst a group of eighty who fled to [[Tehran]].&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. pp.300,305&lt;/ref&gt; On his continued attempt to escape the British he was taken prisoner at [[Ahwaz]] and interned in [[Southern Rhodesia]] where he was held until November 1945 when he was allowed to move to Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. pp.309,321&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen. p.312&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt he built ties with the Muslim Brotherhood. The leader of the mainstream [[Wafd]] party, [[Mustafa el-Nahhas]], regarded him as an extremist.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen. p.315&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 the Arab Higher Council was reformed, once again dominated by traditional leaders from the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. p.323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen. p.333&lt;/ref&gt;

He was not allowed back into Palestine until February 1946 where he represented the Arab case to the Anglo-American Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. p.325&lt;/ref&gt; His presentation was poorly received, in particular when compared to that given by [[Henry Cattan]].&lt;ref&gt;Sykes. pp. 304,305. "Grotesque ineptitude before the Anglo-American Committee."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. p.331&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen. pp.349,458&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1946 he was invited as the Palestinian Arab delegate to the meeting of the Arab League, held at [[Bludan]], Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. p.326&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 [[Fawzi Husseini]], an advocate of dialogue with the Jewish Agency, was assassinated. In an Egyptian newspaper Jamal was quoted as saying that Fawzi 'had strayed'. Other sources quote Jamal as being responsible for all actions taken against collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. pp.328,329,331&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen. pp.352,354&lt;/ref&gt;

In Palestine he embarked on several measures to unify the nationalist movement. He merged the two main youth movements and took over the Land Bank set up by [[Ahmed Hilmi Pasha|Ahmed Hilmi]].&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. p.327&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947 the Arab Higher Committee was recognised by the British Government as representing Palestinian Arabs. Two months later it was recognised by the newly created [[United Nations]] and Jamal travelled to [[Lake Success, New York]], as the spokesman for Palestinian Arabs to the UN.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. pp.326,331&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen pp.382,388&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics maintain that both Jamal and Amin al-Husayni failed to recognise the importance to the [[Haganah]] military operations at the beginning of 1948. Jamal's activities at the UN ended when in July he refused to attend any debates or meetings at which there were Israeli representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. pp.335,336&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen p.437&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Palestine where he was Foreign Minister for the short lived [[All-Palestine Government|Palestinian Arab Government]].&lt;ref&gt;Pappe. pp. 337,339,340,343&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kimche, p.293&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 he joined the entourage of King [[Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud]] of [[Saudi Arabia]] later becoming a close advisor to [[King Saud]].&lt;ref&gt;Monroe. p.279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lacey. p.319&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jordanian intelligence reports, in 1954 Jamal funded a group that failed in an attempt to sabotage an [[Israeli Air Force]] base in the [[Jezreel Valley]]. The same source states that in July 1954 Jamal broke away from Amin al-Husayni and began working exclusively for the Saudis. From January 1955 he was given 1 million Lebanese pounds to finance attacks on Israel from Lebanon. The money was paid to "middle men" but no attacks materialised.&lt;ref&gt;Morris ''Border Wars''. pp.59,63&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeff St John''' (born '''Jeffrey Leo Newton'''; 22 April 1946 – 6 March 2018), was an Australian musician best known for several Australian hits, such as "Teach Me How to Fly" (1970), "Big Time Operator" (1967)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19890420&amp;id=VFBWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=c-cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5515,396900/ |title=The Sydney Morning Herald – Apr 20, 1989 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1989-04-20 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "A Fool in Love" (1977).&lt;ref name="rockonvinyl.blogspot"&gt;[http://rockonvinyl.blogspot.com.au/2009/07/jeff-st-john-live-1973.html Jeff St John – Live]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
St John was born Jeffrey Leo Newton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jack Russell |url=http://ausrock.8m.net/artists/stjohnjeff.htm/ |title=Jeff St John |publisher=Ausrock.8m.net |date=1973-12-27 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 22 April 1946, in [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]], [[Sydney]] and attended Cleveland Street Boys High School in [[Surry Hills, New South Wales]].

He also assisted the development of recording practices like [[overdubbing]], [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[reverb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Fact|title=Joe Meek’s experimental pop classic I Hear A New World gets expanded reissue|url=http://www.factmag.com/2013/02/28/joe-meeks-experimental-pop-classic-i-hear-a-new-world-gets-expanded-reissue/|website=[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]|date=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meek is considered one of the most influential sound engineers of all time, being one of the first to develop ideas such as the [[Recording studio as an instrument|use of recording studios as instruments]], and being recognized for his [[auteur|individual identity as an artist]].&lt;ref name="tmtpat2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patrick|first1=Jonathan|title=Joe Meek’s pop masterpiece I Hear a New World gets the chance to haunt a whole new generation of audiophile geeks|url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/joe-meeks-pop-masterpiece-i-hear-a-new-world-gets-the-chance-to-haunt-a-whole-new-generation-of|website=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|date=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meek's charting singles he produced for other artists include "[[Johnny Remember Me]]" ([[John Leyton]], 1961), "[[Just Like Eddie]]" ([[Heinz Burt|Heinz]], 1963), "Angela Jones" ([[Michael Cox (singer)|Michael Cox]], 1963), "[[Have I the Right?]]" ([[the Honeycombs]], 1964), and "[[Mike Berry (actor)|Tribute to Buddy Holly]]" ([[Mike Berry (actor)|Mike Berry]], 1961). [[The Tornados]]' instrumental [[Telstar (song)|"Telstar"]] (1962), written and produced by Meek, became the first record by a British [[Rock music|rock]] group to reach number one in the [[Billboard Hot 100|US Hot 100]].&lt;ref name="Perone2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=James E.

He also produced music for films such as ''[[Live It Up! (film)|Live It Up!]]'' (US title ''Sing and Swing'', 1963), a pop music film.  Meek's [[concept album]] ''[[I Hear a New World]]'' (1960), which contains innovative use of electronic sounds, was not fully released in his lifetime.

His reputation for experiments in recording music was acknowledged by the [[Music Producers Guild]] who in 2009 created "The Joe Meek Award for Innovation in Production" as an "homage to [the] remarkable producer's pioneering spirit".&lt;ref name="mpg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audioprointernational.com/news/968/Brian-Eno-wins-the-first-Joe-Meek-award |title=Brian Eno wins the first Joe Meek award |publisher=Audioprointernational.com |accessdate=27 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131074922/http://www.audioprointernational.com/news/968/Brian-Eno-wins-the-first-Joe-Meek-award |archivedate=31 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Meek was ranked the greatest producer of all time by ''[[NME]]'', elaborating: "Meek was a complete trailblazer, attempting endless new ideas in his search for the perfect sound. ... The legacy of his endless experimentation is writ large over most of your favourite music today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Meek |url=http://www.nme.com/list/the-50-greatest-producers-ever/262849/article/265277 |title=The 50 Greatest Producers Ever &amp;#124; No. 1 Joe Meek |publisher=Nme.Com |date=23 July 2014 |accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death, Meek possessed thousands of unreleased recordings later dubbed "The Tea Chest Tapes". His commercial success as a producer was short-lived, and he gradually sank into debt and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. On 3 February 1967, using a [[shotgun]] owned by musician [[Heinz Burt]], Meek killed his landlady Violet Shenton and then shot himself.

==Biography==

===Childhood and early careers===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Meek was born at 1 Market Square, [[Newent]], Gloucestershire, and developed an interest in electronics and performance art at a very early age, filling his parents' garden shed with begged and borrowed electronic components, building circuits, radios and what is believed to be the region's first working television. During his [[national service]] in the [[Royal Air Force]], he worked as a [[radar]] technician which increased his interest in electronics and outer space. From 1953 he worked for the [[Midlands Electricity Board]]. He used the resources of the company to develop his interest in electronics and music production, including acquiring a disc cutter and producing his first record.

He left the electricity board to work as an [[audio engineer]] for a leading independent radio production company which made programmes for [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], and made his breakthrough with his work on [[Ivy Benson]]'s ''Music for Lonely Lovers''. His technical ingenuity was first shown on the [[Humphrey Lyttelton]] jazz single "[[Bad Penny Blues]]" ([[Parlophone Records]], 1956) when, contrary to Lyttleton's wishes, Meek 'modified' the sound of the piano and compressed the sound to a greater than normal extent. The record became a hit. He then put enormous effort into [[Denis Preston]]'s Landsdowne Studio but tensions between Preston and Meek soon saw Meek leaving. During his time he recorded US actor [[George Chakiris]] for SAGA Records and it was this that led him to Major Wilfred Alonzo Banks and an independent career. He also engineered many jazz and calypso records including vocalist and percussionist [[Frank Holder (musician)|Frank Holder]] and band leader [[Kenny Graham (musician)|Kenny Graham]].

In January 1960, together with [[William Barrington-Coupe]], Meek founded [[Triumph Records (UK)|Triumph Records]]. At the time Barrington-Coupe was working at SAGA records in Empire Yard, Holloway Road for Major Wilfred Alonzo Banks and it was the Major who provided the finance. The label very nearly had a No.1 hit with Meek's production of "Angela Jones" by [[Michael Cox (singer)|Michael Cox]]. Cox was one of the featured singers on [[Jack Good (producer)|Jack Good's]] TV music show ''[[Boy Meets Girls|Boy Meets Girl]]'' and the song was given massive promotion. As an independent label, Triumph was dependent on small pressing plants, which were unable to meet the demand for product. The record made a respectable appearance in the Top Ten, but it demonstrated that Meek needed the distribution network of the major companies for his records to reach the shops when it mattered.

Its indifferent business results and Meek's temperament eventually led to the label's demise. Meek later licensed many Triumph recordings to labels such as [[Rank Organisation|Top Rank]] and [[Pye Records|Pye]]. That year Meek conceived, wrote and produced an "Outer Space Music Fantasy"' an Album ''[[I Hear A New World]]'' with a band called Rod Freeman &amp; the Blue Men. The album was shelved for decades, apart from the release of some EP tracks taken from it.

===304 Holloway Road===

 |description  = "Telstar" featured a [[clavioline]], a keyboard instrument with a distinctive electronic sound. The piece won an [[Ivor Novello Award]] and sold over five million copies worldwide.}}
Meek went on to set up his own production company known as RGM Sound Ltd (later Meeksville Sound Ltd) with toy importer Major Wilfred Alonzo Banks as his financial backer. He operated from his home studio which he constructed at 304 [[Holloway Road]], [[Islington]], a three-floor flat above a leather-goods store.

His first hit from Holloway Road reached No.1 in the UK: [[John Leyton]]'s "[[Johnny Remember Me]]" (1961) written by [[Geoff Goddard]]. This "death ditty" was cleverly promoted by Leyton's manager, expatriate Australian entrepreneur [[Robert Stigwood]]. Stigwood was able to gain Leyton a booking to perform the song several times in an episode of ''Harpers West One'', a short-lived [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] soap opera&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0161152/|title=''Harpers West One (TV Series 1961–1963)'', IMDb, Undated|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he was making a guest appearance. Meek's third UK No.1 and last major success was with [[the Honeycombs]]' "[[Have I the Right?]]" in 1964, which also became a number 5 hit on the American ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' pop charts. The success of Leyton's recordings was instrumental in establishing Stigwood and Meek as two of Britain's first independent record producers.

When his landlords, who lived downstairs, felt that the noise was too much, they would indicate so with a broom on the ceiling. Joe would signal his contempt by placing loudspeakers in the stairwell and turning up the volume.

A privately manufactured "black plaque" (designed to ape the official [[blue plaque]]) has since been placed at the location of the studio to commemorate Meek's life and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|1755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meek heard many up and coming bands and artists over his career, some of which he didn't see any potential for. After [[Brian Epstein]] asked his opinion of [[the Beatles]]' demo tape, Meek told him not to bother signing them. On another occasion he signed a band on the condition that they get rid of their lead singer: a 16-year-old [[Rod Stewart]].

===Personal life===
Meek became fascinated with the idea of communicating with the dead. He would set up tape machines in graveyards in an attempt to record voices from beyond the grave, in one instance capturing the meows of a cat he held was speaking in human tones, asking for help. In particular, he had an obsession with [[Buddy Holly]] (saying the late American rocker had communicated with him in dreams)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=WowtownTV|title=Joe Meek Warns Buddy Holly - Thomas Truax|date=2016-02-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mX0snoZpmI|accessdate=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://97x.com/the-day-the-music-died-and-the-curse-of-buddy-holly/|title=The Day the Music Died and The Curse of Buddy Holly|website=97X|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other dead rock and roll musicians.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} By the end of his career, Meek's fascination with these topics had taken over his life following the deterioration in his mental health, and he started to believe that his flat contained poltergeists, that aliens were substituting his speech by controlling his mind, and that photographs in his studio were trying to communicate with him.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Meek was affected by [[bipolar disorder]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/not-a-meek-and-mild-story-922611|title=Not a meek and mild story...|last=News|first=Manchester Evening|date=2009-06-25|work=men|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[schizophrenia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/theatre-news/morans-meek-tale-set-go-1059978|title=Moran's Meek tale set go large|last=News|first=Manchester Evening|date=2005-06-30|work=men|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and upon receiving an apparently innocent phone call from American record producer [[Phil Spector]], Meek immediately accused Spector of stealing his ideas before hanging up angrily.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Music Moguls, part 2, Melody Makers&lt;/ref&gt; His professional efforts were often hindered by his [[paranoia]] (Meek was convinced that [[Decca Records]] would put hidden microphones behind his wallpaper to steal his ideas), depression, and extreme mood swings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/958506647|title=Joe Meek's Bold Techniques.|last=Barry.|first=Cleveland,|date=2001|publisher=BookBaby|isbn=9780692368589|oclc=958506647}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Meek started experiencing psychotic delusions, culminating in Meek refusing to use the studio telephone for important communications due to his belief that his landlady was eavesdropping on his calls through the chimney, his belief that he could control the minds of others with his recording equipment, and that he could monitor his acts while away from the studio through supernatural means.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Meek was also a frequent recreational drug user, with his [[Barbiturate dependence|barbiturate abuse]] further worsening his depressive episodes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60093592|title=The legendary Joe Meek : the Telstar man|last=1952-|first=Repsch, John,|date=1989|publisher=Woodford House|isbn=0951473808|location=London|oclc=60093592}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, his heavy consumption of [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] caused him to fly into volatile rages with little or no provocation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/feb/07/popandrock.musicdocumentary|title=Alexis Petridis on the original crazed record producer Joe Meek|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|date=2007-02-07|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/joe-meek-and-the-tragic-demise-of-the-maverick-who-revolutionise/|title=Joe Meek and the tragic demise of the maverick who revolutionised British pop|last=Gritten|first=David|date=2016-10-01|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/920852005|title=Great British eccentrics|last=(Steven),|first=Tucker, S.

Meek's [[homosexuality]] – at a time when homosexual acts were illegal in the UK – put him under further pressure, and he was particularly afraid that his mother would find out about his sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/958506647|title=Joe Meek's Bold Techniques.|last=Barry.|first=Cleveland,|date=2001|publisher=BookBaby|isbn=9780692368589|oclc=958506647}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 he was convicted and fined £15 ({{Inflation|UK|15|1963|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) for "[[cottaging|importuning for immoral purposes]]" in a London [[public toilet]], and was consequently subject to [[blackmail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Bizarrism | author=Chris Mikul | publisher=Critical Vision | year=1999 | isbn=1-900486-06-7 | page=111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1967, police in [[Tattingstone]], Suffolk, discovered two suitcases containing [[Murder_of_Bernard_Oliver|mutilated body parts of Bernard Oliver]]. According to some accounts, Meek was afraid of being questioned by the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fry|first=Colin|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jPtx95MScmsC&amp;pg=PT93|title=The Krays: A Violent Business|publisher=Mainstream|location=Edinburgh|year=2011|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it was known they were intending to interview all of the gay men in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bondeson|first=Jan|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ch38AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP362|title=Murder Houses of London|location=Stroud, Gloucs|publisher=Amberley Publishing|year=2014|page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was enough for him to lose his self-control.&lt;ref name="Savage2006"&gt;{{cite news|last=Savage|first=Jon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/nov/12/popandrock28|title=Meek by name, wild by nature|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=12 November 2006|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meek always walked everywhere outside the studio wearing sunglasses, fearing recognition by local gangsters such as the [[Kray twins]], who he feared would attempt to steal his acts or blackmail him regarding his homosexuality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Meek's depression deepened as his financial position became increasingly desperate. French composer Jean Ledrut accused him of [[plagiarism]], claiming that the melody of "Telstar" had been copied from "La Marche d'Austerlitz", a piece from a score Ledrut had written for the 1960 film ''[[Austerlitz (film)|Austerlitz]]''. The [[lawsuit]] meant that Meek did not receive [[royalties]] from the record during his lifetime, and the issue was not resolved in his favour until three weeks after his death in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10149111/Roger-LaVern.html | location=London | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | title=Roger LaVern | date=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01ndm4t | title=Telstar - The Sound of the Future | work=[[BBC Radio 2]]| accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder and suicide===
On 3 February 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/106225/Joe-Meek-Tragic-demise-of-a-gifted-musical-maverick |title=Joe Meek: Tragic demise of a gifted musical maverick |date=7 June 2009 |publisher=Sunday Express |accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meek killed his landlady Violet Shenton and then himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbindependent.org/node/2540|title=Genius or Insanity?

Meek had flown into a rage and taken the gun from Burt when he informed Meek that he had used it while on tour to shoot birds. Meek had kept the gun under his bed, along with some cartridges. As the shotgun had been owned by Burt, he was questioned intensively by police, before being eliminated from their enquiries.

Meek was subsequently buried at Newent Cemetery, [[Newent]], Gloucestershire. His black granite tombstone can be found near the middle of the cemetery.

==Legacy==
{{original research|date=February 2016}}

===Recording===
Meeks' inability to play a musical instrument or write [[musical notation|notation]] did not prevent him writing and producing successful commercial recordings. For songwriting he was reliant on musicians such as [[Dave Adams (musician)|Dave Adams]], [[Geoff Goddard]] or Charles Blackwell to transcribe melodies from his vocal "demos". He worked on 245 singles, of which 45 reached the top fifty.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} He pioneered studio tools such as multiple over-dubbing on one- and two-track machines, close [[Microphone|miking]], [[DI unit|direct input]] of bass guitars, the [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]], and effects like echo and [[Reverberation|reverb]], as well as [[Sampling (music)|sampling]]. Unlike other producers, his search was for the 'right' sound rather than for a catchy musical tune, and throughout his brief career he single-mindedly followed his quest to create a unique "sonic signature" for every record he produced.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

At a time when many studio engineers were still wearing white coats and assiduously trying to maintain clarity and fidelity, Meek was producing everything on the three floors of his "home" studio and was never afraid to distort or manipulate the sound if it created the effect he was seeking.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Meek was one of the first producers to grasp and fully exploit the possibilities of the modern recording studio. His innovative techniques—physically separating instruments, treating instruments and voices with echo and reverb, processing the sound through his fabled home-made electronic devices, the combining of separately-recorded performances and segments into a painstakingly constructed composite recording—comprised a major breakthrough in sound production. Up to that time, the standard technique for pop recording was to record all the performers in one studio, playing together in real time.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} This was substantially different from that of his contemporary [[Phil Spector]], who typically created his "[[Wall of Sound]]" productions by making live recordings of large ensembles that used multiples of major instruments like bass, guitar, and piano to create the complex sonic backgrounds for his singers.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In 1993, former session singer Ted Fletcher introduced the "Joemeek" line of audio processing equipment. The tribute to Meek was due to his influence in the early stages of audio compression. The name and product line were sold to the American company PMI Audio Group in 2003. The current product line includes a microphone series called "Telstar", named after Meek's biggest hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joemeek.com/ |title=Joemeek.com |publisher=Joemeek.com |date= |accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pmiaudio.com/about.html |title=PMI Audio Group |publisher=Pmiaudio.com |date= |accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The Tea Chest Tapes"===
After Meek's death, the thousands of recordings he hid at his studio remained unreleased and preserved by Cliff Cooper of the Millionaires. Subsequent to his suicide in 1967, Cooper is said to have purchased all of Meek's recordings for £300 ({{Inflation|UK|300|1967|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) . These recordings were called the "Tea Chest Tapes" among fans, as they were stored in a [[tea chest]] when Cooper took them out of his flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/forest/headlines/Meek-s-Tea-Chest-Tapes-auctionarticle-305759-details/article.html  | title = Meek's 'Tea Chest Tapes' go to auction|website=Thisisgloucestershire.co.uk | accessdate = 26 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Blackburn, former president of the Joe Meek Appreciation Society, catalogued all of them in the mid 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/04/joe.meek.master.tapes  | title = What's on Joe Meek's master tapes? | accessdate = 26 May 2009 | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=Chris | last=Cottingham | date=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 September 2008 these unreleased recordings went up for auction in Fame Bureau's 'It's More Than Rock 'N' Roll' auction, fetching £200,000.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} They contained over 4,000 hours of music on 1,850 tapes, including recordings by [[David Bowie]] as singer and sax player with the Konrads, Gene Vincent, [[Denny Laine]], [[Billy Fury]], Tom Jones, [[Jimmy Page]], Mike Berry, John Leyton, [[Ritchie Blackmore]], [[Jess Conrad]], [[Mitch Mitchell]] and Screaming Lord Sutch. The tapes also contained many examples of Meek composing songs and experimental sound techniques. Tape 418 has Meek composing songs for the film ''[[Live It Up! (film)|Live It Up!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/5715376 | title = Joe Meek Archive The entire collection of Joe|website=Liveauctioneers.com | accessdate = 26 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artists produced by Meek===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
Meek passed up the chance to work with the then unknown [[David Bowie]], [[the Beatles]] (the latter he once described as "just another bunch of noise, copying other people's music") and [[Rod Stewart]]. John Repsch, in ''The Legendary Joe Meek'' recounts that upon hearing Stewart sing, Meek rushed into the studio, put his fingers in his ears and screamed until Stewart had left. He preferred to record instrumentals with the band he sang with – the Moontrekkers.

In 1963 Meek worked with a then little-known singer [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], then the lead vocalist of Tommy Scott &amp; the Senators. Meek recorded seven tracks with Jones and took them to various labels in an attempt to get a record deal, with no success. Two years later after Jones' worldwide hit "[[It's Not Unusual]]" in 1965, Meek was able to sell the tapes he had recorded with Jones to Tower (USA) and [[Columbia (EMI)|Columbia]] (UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.txhighlands.com/deccalisting1.htm|title=''Tom Jones' Visual Discography'', B.J.

===Biographies===
In later years, the interest in Meek's life as well as influence on the music industry, has spawned at least two documentary films, a radio play, a stage play and a feature film.
*On 8 February 1991, the [[BBC]] showed a 60-minute documentary in its ''Arena'' documentary series, entitled ''The Very Strange Story of... the Legendary Joe Meek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0324086/combined|title=IMDb: ''"Arena" The Very Strange Story of... The Legendary Joe Meek (1991)''|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC has since reprised the documentary several times.
*On 26 March 1994, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast ''Lonely Joe'', a radio play based on the life of Meek, written by Janey Praeger and Peter Kavanagh.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130506003358/http://myiget.net/audio_books/bbc-r4---janie-prager-and-peter-kavanagh-apos-s--apos-lonely-joe-apos---joe-911088.htm] &lt;/ref&gt;
*On 2 February 2005, ''Telstar'', a stage play about Meek, written by actors [[Nick Moran]] and James Hicks, opened at the [[Cambridge Arts Theatre]] and then toured to [[York]], [[Darlington]], [[Guildford]], [[Eastbourne]] and [[Manchester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E8821106849367/Stars+Tour+Lord+Arthur%2C+Telstar%2C+Arsenic+%26+Old+Lace.html|title=What's on Stage, 4 February 2005: Stars Tour ''Lord Arthur'', ''Telstar'', ''Arsenic &amp; Old Lace''|website=Whatsonstage.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; before opening up at the [[Ambassadors Theatre (London)|New Ambassadors Theatre]] in London on 24 June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E8821114089689/Moran%27s+Debut+Play+Telstar+Transfers+to+West+End.html|title=Wat's On Stage, 21 April 2005: Moran's Debut Play ''Telstar'' Transfers to West End|website=Whatsonstage.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tributes and references===
A number of artists have made tributes to Meek in various ways:
* Franco-English pop singer-songwriter [[MeeK (musician)|MeeK]] chose his stage name as a homage to the British producer.
* British punk [[Wreckless Eric]] recounts Meek's life and recreates some of his studio effects in his song "Joe Meek" from the album ''Donovan of Trash''.
* [[The Marked Men]], a Texas punk band, have a song titled "Someday" with lyric:  "Joe Meek wanted all the world to know about the news he found."
* The [[Frank Black]] song "White Noise Maker" deals with Meek's suicide by shotgun, the white noise maker of the title. "It's been so long since my Telstar."
* The Bleeder Group, a Danish alternative rock group recorded a song on their second album ''Sunrise'', called "Joe Meek Shall Inherit the Earth"
* [[Matmos]], an Electronic duo, have a song on their 2006 album ''The Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of the Beast'' called "Solo Buttons for Joe Meek".
* Pluto Monkey, British left field artist, released a three track CD single on Shifty Disco featuring the tracks "Joe Meek" and "Meeksville Sound Is Dead"
* [[Swing Out Sister]] include a short instrumental named "Joe Meek's Cat" on their 1997 album ''Shapes and Patterns'', inspired by Meek's 1966 ghost-hunting expeditions to Warley Lea Farm during which he allegedly captured recordings of a talking cat channelling the spirit of a former landowner who committed suicide at the farm
* [[Graham Parker]]'s 1992 album ''Burning Questions'' includes the cryptic "Just Like Joe Meek's Blues"
* [[Sheryl Crow]] claimed that her song "[[A Change Would Do You Good]]" was inspired by an article she read about Meek
* [[Jonathan King]] recorded a song about Meek called "He Stood in the Bath He Stamped on the Floor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbCsq9Rx-yc |title=Video: "He Stood In The Bath He Stamped On The Floor" |publisher=Youtube.com |date=6 January 2007 |accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Johnny Stage, Danish producer and guitarist released an album in tribute of Meek, entitled ''The Lady with the Crying Eyes'' featuring various Danish artists, on 3 February 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/joemeektribute|title=Myspace: Joe Meek Tribute|website=Myspace.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dave Stewart (keyboardist)|Dave Stewart]] (the keyboardist) and [[Barbara Gaskin]] recorded the song "Your Lucky Star" dealing with the life and death of Meek, released on the 1991 album "Spin". Dave Stewart also recorded a version of "Telstar" on the occasion of its 40th anniversary in 2002. This was later released on the Dave Stewart and [[Barbara Gaskin]] 2009 mini-album "Hour Moon". The album also features the duo's previously released Meek tribute "Your Lucky Star" from their 1991 album "Spin".
* The Spanish label ''Spicnic'' released in 2001 a tribute CD, "Oigo un nuevo no mundo. Homenaje a Joe Meek", featuring various Spanish bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spicnic.com/ |title=Spicnic label website |publisher=Spicnic.com |date= |accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Trey Spruance]], from the band [[Mr. Bungle]], has stated that the ten-part song/instrumental "The Bends" from their album ''[[Disco Volante (Mr. Bungle album)|Disco Volante]]'' is inspired by Joe Meek's music. Specifically "[[I Hear a New World]]".
* [[Thomas Truax]] regularly performed his Meek tribute "Joe Meek Warns Buddy Holly" on his 2008 tours, a song apparently about Meek's supposed warning via spirit-writing predicting Buddy Holly's death. A single and accompanying video was scheduled for release on 3 February 2009, the 50th anniversary of Holly's demise, also the date of Meek's suicide.
* Robb Shenton released "Lonely Joe" as a tribute to the producer on 28 October 2008. Shenton was one of Meek's artists and was with five Meek bands between 1963 and early 1966: The Bobcats, David John and the Mood, the Prestons, the Nashpool and Flip and the Dateliners. He also sang backing vocals with many others.
* "Meet Joe Meek" sometimes known as "Just Like Joe Meek" by the Babysitars sampled the BBC 2 ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'' documentary on Meek and their composition "Crazyhead" was said to be inspired by Meek.
* In 2004 and 2006 respectively, UK record label Western Star records put together and released two volumes of Meek tributes on CD. These compilations were made up of Western Star artists all paying tribute by recording songs originally recorded or written by Meek. Then in 2012, producer, label boss and long time Meek enthusiast Alan Wilson released "Holloway Road", a song about Meek. This featured on the album ''Infamy'', by his own band The Sharks.
* In 2005, Cane 141 released a B-Side called "Joe Meek Shall Inherit The Earth".

'''John Davies''' (1823 - 1874) was a Welsh Methodist minister. He was born in [[Llandovery]], and as a young boy attended a school in [[Myddfai]] for a while before moving to attend classes at Hanover School, near [[Abergavenny]]. In 1842, he began a period of study at [[Brecon]] College, following which, as an ordained minister, he held appointments at; [[Llanelly]], Brecknock (1846), [[Aberaman]] (1854), Mount Stuart, [[Cardiff]] (1863), and Hannah Street, [[Cardiff]] (1868–74).

His written works include a booklet (to counteract the influence of the Mormons in Wales), 'Y Doniau Gwyrthiol' (1851). He was an editor of 'Y Beirniad', and also participated in the establishment of 'Yr Adolygydd' (1850).

He died in May 1874, and was buried in [[Cardiff]] cemetery.

Wolfe supports a return to the [[Glass-Steagall Act]] to separate speculative activity from commercial banking. He favors the use of [[Anti-Trust Laws]] to reduce the size of "megabanks," and proposes a tax on [[financial derivatives]]. He also proposes an "Alternate Federal Reserve" which would loan to community banks, small business, and individuals, as opposed to the [[Federal Reserve Bank]], which, Wolfe contends, serves primarily the interests of the six largest banks. Wolfe is also a critic of the [[Affordable Care Act]], saying that it is oriented primarily toward helping the insurance and pharmaceutical companies. Instead, he supports [[Medicare for All]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnwolfeforamerica2012.com/content/Issues/Issues.asp John Wolfe on the Issues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503041420/http://www.johnwolfeforamerica2012.com/content/Issues/Issues.asp |date=2012-05-03 }}, campaign website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Joker''''' was a British comic strip. It first appeared in ''[[Knockout (UK comics)|Knockout]]'' issue 1 (series 2) on 12 June 1971. ''Knockout'' merged with ''[[Whizzer and Chips]]'' in 1973. ''Joker'' stayed in ''Whizzer and Chips'' as a Whizz-kid until the end, when he continued in ''Buster'' until the close of the comic on 4 January 2000. On the "last page" of ''Buster'', Joker reveals that he was [[Jeremy Beadle]] all along. The strip was written by Malcolm Morrison, and illustrated by [[Sid Burgon]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham Kibble-White  The Ultimate Book of British Comics - 2005 Page 279 'Sid's Snake' fame), the serpent-rearing chap actually headlined the 'other' paper upon Whizzer and Chips's launch in October 1969 (whereupon the title came free with twelve 'super stickers', featuring a variety of 'Sid Says' slogans such as 'Sid ...

'''Josef Hiršal''' (24 July 1920 &amp;ndash; 15 September 2003) was a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] author, poet and novelist.

Hiršal was widely regarded as one of the most important Czech authors of [[experimental poetry]]; after early surrealistic writings, he made his literary debut with a collection of poems. Later on, he joined the group of artists around [[Jiří Kolář]], a friend of whom he remained for his entire life and with whom he published children's books in the 1950s after having been forbidden any kind of work during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation. He later on signed the [[Charta 77]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In the 1960s, Hiršal he started writing experimental poetry with partner, poet [[Bohumila Grögerová]].  The couple also co-authored several books and translated more than 180 works.&lt;ref name=rprague&gt;{{cite news|first=Ian |last=Fernandez |title=Poet and translator Bohumila Grögerová dies at 93 |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/poet-and-translator-bohumila-groegerova-dies-at-93 |work=[[Radio Prague]] |publisher= |date=2014-08-23 |accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josef Hiršal built a reputation as a translator of foreign works into the [[Czech language]], translating the works of, among others, [[Christian Morgenstern]], [[Ernst Jandl]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Wolfgang Hildesheimer]], [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Heinrich Heine]], [[H. C. Artmann]], [[Helmut Heissenbüttel]], [[Fernando Pessoa]] and [[Torquato Tasso]]; in 1989, he received the [[Grand Austrian State Prize]] for his translations.

Josef Hiršal died in September 2003 following an accident with the [[Prague]] tram in May in which he was seriously injured. Bohumila Grögerová, who survived him, died on 22 August 2014, at the age of 93.&lt;ref name=rprague/&gt;

'''Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff''' (born September 19, 1960) is a convicted American [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficker]] and [[organized crime]] figure.

McGriff came to prominence in the early 1980s when he formed his own [[Crack cocaine|crack]]-distributing organization which he called the [[Supreme Team (gang)|Supreme Team]] based in the [[South Jamaica, Queens|South Jamaica]] section of [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Under McGriff's leadership, the gang's numbers swelled to the hundreds and came to control the crack cocaine trade in the [[Baisley Park Houses]], the neighborhood where McGriff was raised.

In 1987, McGriff was arrested following a joint state and federal investigation and in 1989 pleaded guilty to engaging in a [[Continuing Criminal Enterprise]]. He was sentenced to 12 years' incarceration. McGriff was released from prison on parole in early 1994 after serving approximately seven years of his sentence. He was sent back to prison on parole violations by year's end, and served another 2½ years' incarceration before being released in 1997.

McGriff is alleged to have had a hand in the 2002 murder of [[Run-DMC]] member [[Jam Master Jay]], and was convicted of ordering the 2001 killing of [[Mobb Deep]] affiliate E-Moneybags (real name Eric Smith).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/02/nyregion/02mcgriff.html | work=The New York Times | first=William K. | last=Rashbaum | title=Man Convicted in 2 Killings; U.S. to Pursue the Death Penalty | date=February 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal authorities also accused him in connection with the attempted murder of rapper [[50 Cent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/09/07/entertainment/main822172.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Feds Lay Out Alleged 50 Cent Plot | date=September 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent rumors suggest that McGriff felt 50 Cent had exposed too much of the drug kingpin in [[Jamaica, Queens]], and others involved in the drug trade through the lyrics of his song "[[Ghetto Qu'ran (Forgive Me)|Ghetto Qu'ran]]" released in 2000.

On February 1, 2007, McGriff was convicted of [[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]] at a Federal court in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York|Eastern District of New York]] on charges that he paid $50,000 to have two rivals (Eric Smith and "Big Nose" Troy Singleton) gunned down in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,251209,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Hip-Hop Drug Lord Kenneth 'Supreme' McGriff Gets Life Without Parole for Slayings | date=February 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury deliberated for five days before finding McGriff guilty of murder conspiracy and drug trafficking. On February 9, 2007, the same jury sentenced McGriff to life in prison. Throughout this case he was defended by a court-appointed attorney because nearly all of his assets had been seized.

McGriff began serving his life sentence at [[ADX Florence]], the federal [[supermax prison]] in [[Colorado]], but in 2011, was transferred to the [[United States Penitentiary, Lee]], a high-security federal prison in [[Pennington Gap, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://betamericangangster.blogspot.com/2010/12/season-two-episode-10-kenneth-supreme.html A blog "open to invited readers only"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;LastName=mcgriff&amp;Middle=&amp;FirstName=kenneth&amp;Race=B&amp;Sex=M&amp;Age=&amp;x=332&amp;y=290 McGriff's entry at the US Bureau of Prisons]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Korihor''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|r|ɪ|h|ɔːr}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «kō´rĭ-hōr»&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[anti-christ]] described in {{lds|Alma|alma|30}} in the [[Book of Mormon]].

==Life==

Korihor is directly referred to in the Book of Mormon as an [[antichrist|Anti-Christ]], because he claimed there will be no [[Christ]]. Korihor was able to preach his views to the people because of the land's freedom of religion. These teachings alarmed the clerical government in [[Zarahemla]], who felt that his views were dangerous to their society, as people had begun to ignore the laws of the land (which were based on the religious beliefs of their society). He attempted to preach to the people of [[Ammon]], but the residents had kicked him out of [[Jershon]]. He also tried preaching in Gideon and he was arrested; before a high priest, during a hearing for his apparent [[blasphemy]] and for causing social discord, Korihor offered a speech in his own defense. Korihor was turned over to higher authority and later got into an argument with the chief judge and governor, [[Alma the Younger|Alma]] regarding the existence of God. Alma responded to Korihor's arguments, stating that all things testified that there is a God. Korihor finally demanded that Alma show him a sign from God or he, Korihor, would not believe in God. This culminated in Korihor being miraculously rendered deaf and mute, upon which Korihor confessed, in writing:
{{quote|...I always knew that there was a God. But behold, the devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto me in the form of an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they have all gone astray after an unknown God. And he said unto me: There is no God; yea, and he taught me that which I should say.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|30|52|53}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Korihor begged for forgiveness, but Alma, sensing that Korihor would go back to his wicked ways, cast Korihor out. Korihor became a beggar and was later trampled to death by the [[Zoramites]], a group who had separated themselves from the main [[Nephite]] society.

== Teachings ==

Korihor's statements provide explicit arguments for atheism, which have been categorized as arguments for agnosticism, empiricism, secular humanism, and relativism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Riddle |first= Chauncey |title= Korihor: The Arguments of Apostasy |url= http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/transcripts/?id=45 |publisher= [[Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship]], [[BYU]] |accessdate= 4 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Lund |first= Gerald N. |authorlink= Gerald N. Lund |date=July 1992 |title= Countering Korihor's Philosophy |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/1992/07/countering-korihors-philosophy?lang=eng |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps because of the direct treatment that Korihor gives the topic of atheism, his words have been cited by skeptics as exemplary, while devotees cite his teachings in an attempt to inoculate their audiences against similar heresy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Warner |first= C. Terry |authorlink= C. Terry Warner |title= An Open Letter to Students: On Having Faith and Thinking for Yourself |url= http://www.lds.org/new-era/1971/11/an-open-letter-to-students-on-having-faith-and-thinking-for-yourself?lang=eng |journal= [[New Era (magazine)|New Era]] |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Chapter 29: Alma 30–31 |url= http://www.lds.org/manual/book-of-mormon-teacher-manual/chapter-29?lang=eng |work= Book of Mormon Teacher Manual: Religion 121-122 |publisher= [[Institute of Religion|Institute program]], [[Church Educational System]], LDS Church |year= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Korihor's argument was two-fold. First, that "ye cannot know of things which ye do not see", from which he extrapolated that there is no fairness or unfairness, no crime or sin, no cause for shame, and no eternal consequence of actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|30|15|18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of sin, the need for an atoning sacrifice&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|30|12|17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ordinances and religious participation to connect people to that atoning sacrifice&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|30|23}}&lt;/ref&gt; are obviated, and followers are instead encouraged to "look up with boldness", "enjoy their rights and privileges", and "make use of that which is their own".&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|20|27|28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, Korihor hypothesizes that the only reason for perpetuation of orthodox beliefs is "a foolish and vain hope"&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|30|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the part of believers, and, on the part of priests and teachers, a desire "to usurp power and authority over [the people]"&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|30|23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "keep them down, even as it were in bondage, that ye may glut yourselves with the labors of their hands".&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|30|27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible origin of the name ==
[[File:KingHerihorAdoreOsiris.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Herihor or Kherihor, who Hugh Nibley relates to the name Korihor.]]

[[Hugh Nibley]] relates the name to Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Nibley|Nibley, Hugh]] &amp; Hummel, Sharman Bookwalter (ed.) ''Nibley's Commentary on the Book of Mormon, Vol. 1'' (2013), ASIN: B00GFY0GUO&lt;/ref&gt; and states:

:"The first high priest [of the twenty-first dynasty in Egypt] was called Korihor, and his son was called Piankhi - two Book of Mormon names."

Nibley relates Korihor's name to [[Herihor|Kherihor]], a high priest at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].&lt;ref&gt;''Lehi in the Desert'', p. 27. Nibley's source for the Egyptian name is [[Hermann Ranke]], ''Die Agyptischen Personennamen'' ["The Egyptian Personal Names"], Gluckstadt: Augustin, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laura Caller''' (1915&amp;ndash;1988)

Union lawyer, defender of peasants and politicians.

She was born in [[Cusco]] in a home frequented by intellectuals of the city due to the activities of her father, a journalist and writer.

She studied primary and started secondary school in the Colegio María Auxiliadora, Cusco, where she was expelled at age twelve for resistance to the "almost monastic" rules. She entered the College of Sciences Cusco, exclusively for men, with the support of famous Cusco intellectual [[:es:José Uriel García|José Uriel García]].

In 1938 she came to [[Lima]] to study at university, intending to study agronomy, but decided on Law at the [[National University of San Marcos]], where she majored in Agricultural Law.

Her professional work was dedicated from the start to the defence of the rights of peasant communities, and political prisoners. Her fight against the exploitation of the defenceless defined her political ideas for socialism.

Her reputation for social advocacy dates back to the 40s and 50s, however it was in 1963, when defending 200 political prisoners confined in the island prison of [[El Frontón]], that she achieved notoriety because it was the first time a woman had faced a military tribunal as a defender. In 1966 she helped get [[Hugo Blanco (politician)|Hugo Blanco]] acquitted of the death penalty and became internationally known.

In 1975 she endorsed the case of the rural community of [[Huayanay]], on the heights of [[Huancavelica]], who had killed the village leader in the main square, according to their ancestral customs. They were exonerated by the Velasco government, but later some of them were imprisoned in Lima.

She never married because she considered herself married to the law and led a life of austerity and sacrifice.

As a social activist she travelled around the country visiting rural communities and remote mining camps. She and her famous poncho were seen in the villages as a sign of hope. She herself was imprisoned for the crime of defending the poor.

Campaigner for women's votes and defender of peasants, she never obtained a seat in Parliament, but in 1980 joined the board of the [[FOCEP]] political group as vice-president.

In 1985 she had a leg amputated due to gangrene, a result of diabetes. Months later she travelled to [[Cuba]] for rehabilitation from which she returned with a prosthesis to continue working in the defence of the needy. She died in Lima on March 15, 1988 due to a worsening of her disease, 48 hours before she was due to receive an award from the Ministry of Labour.

She is commemorated by name in the village of Laura Caller, San Luis District, Peru.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of people on the cover of ''Attitude'' magazine}}
This is a list of people who have appeared on the front cover of ''[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]'', a gay lifestyle magazine that is printed monthly in the United Kingdom.

== Statistics ==
Often, the cover is of a straight celebrity gay people worship at the time. As of May 2010, attitude created 151 magazines of which 106 covers have been dedicated to straight celebrities or politicians. Only 45 covers have been dedicated to gay celebrities. The longest stretch straight celebrities have not appeared on the cover is two months. Editor Matthew Todd has claimed has suggested there are not enough famous gay people to have them on the cover constantly and has made a point of putting celebrities on the cover such as Beth Ditto (first gay woman on an ''Attitude'' cover) and Kele Okereke (first black gay man on an ''Attitude'' cover).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12913">'''Marc-Antoine Jullien''', called '''Jullien fils''', (born [[Paris]], March 10, 1775 – died there April 4, 1848) was a [[France|French]] [[French Revolution|revolutionary]] and man of letters.

==Life==
Son of [[Marc Antoine Jullien]], deputy from [[Drôme]] in the [[National Convention]], he entered the [[Collège de Navarre]] in 1785; his studies were interrupted by the beginning of the Revolution.  Encouraged by his ardently patriotic mother, Rosalie Ducrolay, named "Madame Jullien", he attempted a career in journalism, in 1790 becoming a collaborator on the ''[[Journal du Soir]]''.  The following year, he became a member of the [[Jacobin Club]], in which he became an opponent of war.

In the spring of 1792, Jullien was sent to [[London]] by the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], at the time president of the ''[[comité diplomatique]]'' of the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]].  There he served as a student-diplomat, becoming an intermediary between the more liberal English factions and the [[Girondist]]s.  Among those he met there were [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]] and [[Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Stanhope]].  Returning to France that autumn, he was named ''aide-commissaire''m and then ''commissaire des guerres'', of the army of the [[Pyrenees]], in January 1793.  He was soon transferred to [[Tarbes]] "due to age".  He rejoined the army of the Pyrenees on April 16, entering Paris with them on August 4.

Jullien then became a protégé of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]], and was sent by the [[Committee of Public Safety]] on a mission to several Atlantic ports, beginning on September 10, 1793.  Charged with ensuring surveillance of the military situation and of [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] propaganda, he attempted to gain for himself a rapport with public feeling.  In [[Nantes]], on February 4, 1794, he wrote a letter to Robespierre in which he denounced [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier|Carrier]].  At [[Bordeaux]], he stood in opposition to [[Jean-Lambert Tallien]] and his mistress, [[Thérésa Cabarrús]].  He left Bordeaux to return to Paris on April 24, 1794; there he was named to the Executive Committee on Public Instruction.  On May 18, he returned to Bordeaux, to purify the municipality and the Jacobin Club and seek out hidden Girondists among the deputies.

Jullien would likely have become a major player in the Revolution had it not been for the execution, by [[guillotine]], of Robespierre in July 1794.  Made destitute, he was arrested on August 10 and sent to prison; he would be held at the ''maison de santé'' of Notre-Dame-des-Champs, and would testify at Carrier's trial. He disavowed his association with Robespierre and was released, through the intervention of his father, on October 14, 1795. Ten days later, the insurrection of [[13 Vendémiaire]] was stopped.

Jullien next became one of the founders of the [[Club du Panthéon]], returning to journalism with the creation of ''[[L'Orateur plébéien]]'', a democratic and moderate pamphlet, with [[Ève Demaillot]] and [[Jean-Jacques Leuliette]]. On March 13, 1796, [[Philippe-Antoine Merlin de Douai|Merlin de Douai]] helped him enter the [[Ministère de la Police]], where he became responsible for lists of emigrans. He soon became suspected of [[François-Noël Babeuf|Babouvist]] sympathies, and was forced to hide after the discovery of the Conspiracy of Equals in May 1796; he reappeared in October of the same year.

Jullien next joined the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]], becoming a writer for its mail service from August to November 1797.  He then accompanied [[Napoleon I]], in May 1798, on his journey to [[Egypt]]. There he became ill, and returned to France with [[Louis Bonaparte]]. Becoming well, he entered the service of general [[Jean Étienne Championnet|Championnet]], becoming an adviser on December 28, 1798. Among the initiators of the [[Neapolitan Republic (Napoleonic)|Neapolitan Republic]], he became secretary general to Championnet's provisional government on January 26, 1799. He was quickly recalled by the [[French Directory|Directory]], and was arrested on February 24. On March 12 he stood before a [[military tribunal]], but was freed by the [[Coup of 30 Prairial Year VII]] on June 18.

Accommodating the coup of [[18 Brumaire]] to satisfaction, Jullien proposed a plan to unify the Italian states in July 1800.  Immediately becoming indignant at anti-Jacobin proscriptions, following the [[Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise]] he was relegated to handling administrative functions in Paris. He received the cross of the [[Légion d'honneur]] in 1803. After a visit to [[Anne Louise Germaine de Staël|Madame de Staël]] at [[Chaumont-sur-Loire]], through which he raised Napoleon's suspicions, he was sent to the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1810; while passing through [[Yverdon]], he became acquainted with the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[pedagogue]] [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]].

In 1813. Jullien was jailed due to his opposition to the Empire.  Freed during the [[Bourbon Restoration]], he published numerous opposition journals between 1815 and 1817, becoming known in the process as a pedagogue.  He corresponded regularly with Pestalozzi, to whom he sent his first three sons, at Yverdon, and became a promoter of the [[Monitorial System]] of education. In 1819 he founded ''Revue encyclopédique''.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Revue encyclopédique]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jullien died in Paris in 1848.

==Marriage and family==
In 1801 Jullien married Sophie-Juvence Nioche (died 1832); she bore him six children.

The eldest of the six, Pierre-Adolphe (born [[Amiens]], February 13, 1803 - died 1873) was a technician, later becoming engineer-in-chief of the [[Corps of Bridges and Roads (France)|Corps of Bridges and Roads]]; in this capacity he oversaw construction of the Paris-[[Lyon]] railroad.

Also among the six, their daughter Antoinette-Stéphanie married the dramatist [[Lockroy]] and was the mother of [[Édouard Lockroy]].

[[Image:Martín Luis Guzmán.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Martín Luis Guzmán.]]
'''Martín Luis Guzmán Franco''' (October 6, 1887 – December 22, 1976) was a Mexican [[novelist]] and journalist.

==Life==
Guzmán was born in [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua]]. Along with [[Mariano Azuela]], he is considered a pioneer of the [[revolutionary novel]], a genre inspired by the experiences of the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910.  His novels ''[[:es:La sombra del caudillo|La sombra del caudillo]]'' (1929) and ''El águila y la serpiente'' (1928) depict the [[Mexican Revolution]] and its political aftermath, both of which the author was familiar with, having contributed both to revolutionary agitation and to the formation of the new revolutionary government.

For several months in 1914, he was under the direct orders of General [[Pancho Villa|Francisco "Pancho" Villa]].  He later wrote a five-volume [[biography]] of Villa, ''Memorias de Pancho Villa'' (1936-1951).

Martin Luis Guzmán died suddenly on December 22, 1976 in [[Mexico City]] due an acute myocardial infarction. His widow Ana West, died seven years after him, on October 21, 1983. She was 95 years old when, after being hospitalized for some days due to an acute bilateral pneumonia, she suffered a cardiac arrest and died.

'''Michael J. Scofield''', portrayed by [[Wentworth Miller]], is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and one of the two [[protagonist]]s of the American [[television series]] ''[[Prison Break]]''. The character first appeared in the [[Pilot (Prison Break episode)|series pilot]], in which he deliberately sends himself to prison so as to break his elder brother, [[Lincoln Burrows]] ([[Dominic Purcell]]), out before his execution for a crime he did not commit. The storyline of the first season revolves around the two brothers and Michael's plan to help Lincoln escape his death sentence. Later seasons detail their life on the run and their quest for the truth behind Lincoln's imprisonment. As the principal character, Michael has been featured in every episode of the series. Although both Lincoln and Michael are the main protagonists of the series, Michael has been featured more extensively than Lincoln, especially in the first season and the third.

Various flashbacks from subsequent episodes provide further insight into the relationship between Michael and his brother, and the reasons behind Michael's determination in helping Lincoln to escape his [[death sentence]]. In the episode flashbacks, the younger Michael is played by [[Dylan Minnette]].

It is later revealed that Michael has [[Latent inhibition#Low latent inhibition|low latent inhibition]], a psychological condition in which one sees the world as pieces, rather than mere objects.

==Appearances==

===Season 1===
The opening scene of the series shows Michael's final preparation of his plan to infiltrate [[Fox River State Penitentiary]]; a tattooist is applying the finishing touches to [[Prison Break#Tattoo|Michael's tattoo]], which is prominently featured in the first season. In order to get into Fox River, Michael robs a bank at gun point and pleads [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] at his trial, and requests that he be sent to the prison nearest to his home. Michael begins his sentence on April 11, exactly a month before Lincoln is set to be [[execution|executed]].&lt;ref&gt;As shown in the scene where Michael looks at the diary on Henry Pope's desk after the fight with Abruzzi in the [[Pilot (Prison Break episode)|series premiere]].&lt;/ref&gt; Once there, he scrutinizes every detail regarding the prison and its inhabitants.

Given Scofield's educational background, inmates and correctional officers alike would often wonder why a man of Michael's credentials would have thrown such a privileged life away to end up in a state penitentiary. Even more intriguing are his weird "habits"; he is often seen conversing discreetly with his brother during Prison Industry time and Chapel time; and the fact that he tends to execute a highly defined stare around Fox River's boundaries immediately from the point he got incarcerated as well as being called personally on command by the prison's warden himself, Henry Pope.

The season follows Michael as he puts his plan into action while overcoming various obstacles. In the first 13 episodes, Michael is seen to have a specific objective in each episode that he must accomplish in order to build an escape route out of the prison. On the way, he recruits a number of people to aid in the escape: his cellmate [[Fernando Sucre]] ([[Amaury Nolasco]]) to help him dig, mob boss [[John Abruzzi]] ([[Peter Stormare]]) to get him on PI ([[Federal Prison Industries, Inc.|Prison Industries]]) and provide air transport once they escape, and [[Charles Westmoreland]] ([[Muse Watson]]), who he believes to be [[D. B. Cooper]] and can help finance their lives as fugitives.

Michael feigns [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]], giving him daily access to the infirmary (the escapees' exit point from the prison) and allowing him to build a relationship with Dr. [[Sara Tancredi]] ([[Sarah Wayne Callies]]), who happens to be the daughter of [[Frank Tancredi]] ([[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]]), the [[Governor of Illinois]]. After agreeing to help Warden [[Henry Pope]] ([[Stacy Keach]]) finish his [[Taj Mahal]] replica in his office, Michael also forms a friendship with Pope. He also later stages "brief insanity" to gain access to the penitentiary's premises to gain contact with one of its insane inhabitants gifted with photographic memory, in order to re-acquire the portion of the tattooed blueprint that he lost after coming into contact with a steaming hot piece of metal.

Michael's relationship with Sara is featured prominently in the nineteenth episode, "[[The Key (Prison Break episode)|The Key]]", where he fails to steal the key to the infirmary from her. Although she finds out about his motive for being in the infirmary in the following episode, Sara decides to help Michael by leaving the infirmary door unlocked on the night of the escape. Towards the end of the season, Michael finally succeeds in helping his brother escape from Fox River State Penitentiary through the window of the infirmary, but also aids the escape of six other prisoners.

=== Season 2 ===
In the second season of the series, the story continues to follow Michael, his brother and other escapees as they try to evade the authorities pursuing them. Away from the prison setting, Michael and Lincoln are frequently featured in scenes together in the first seven episodes. Michael and Lincoln travel together, after the fugitives separate to accomplish each of their individual goals. When they fail to retrieve [[L. J. Burrows]] before his trial, they decide to head to Utah to find Westmoreland's hidden money. There, they reunite with four of the other escapees: Sucre, [[Benjamin Miles "C-Note" Franklin|C-Note]] ([[Rockmond Dunbar]]), [[Theodore "T-Bag" Bagwell|T-Bag]] ([[Robert Knepper]]) and [[David "Tweener" Apolskis|Tweener]] ([[Lane Garrison]]).

The seventh episode of the season, "[[Buried (Prison Break episode)|Buried]]" marks the first time Lincoln and Michael separate, when Lincoln decides to go after his son, L. J., who has been released from prison. Michael fails to retrieve the money after being fooled by T-Bag. Nevertheless, Michael continues to execute his plan in order to meet the [[People smuggling|coyote]] at the 'Bolshoi Booze' location. Prior to leaving for 'Bolshoi Booze', Michael meets Sara at the location which he encoded in his messages to her inside the origami cranes. Thinking that she had declined his invitation to Panama, Michael goes to meet the coyote, who has the location of an escape plane to Mexico. There, Michael is reunited with Lincoln, Sucre and the brothers' father, [[Aldo Burrows]] ([[Anthony Denison]]).

When Aldo is killed by Agent [[Alexander Mahone]] ([[William Fichtner]]), Michael and Lincoln decide to confront "[[The Company (Prison Break)|The Company]]" and the conspiracy, and bid farewell to Sucre, who alights the getaway plane to Mexico. After a brief capture by Mahone, Michael and Lincoln are aided in their escape by [[Paul Kellerman]] ([[Paul Adelstein]]), who turns against The Company in an act of self-preservation. Kellerman takes them to [[Terrence Steadman]], the man Lincoln is accused of murdering. Steadman's suicide forces Michael, Lincoln and Kellerman to find Sara since she holds the key to unlocking information that can expose the conspiracy. After Sara joins them, Michael, Lincoln and Kellerman head to Chicago, where Sara's father has hidden the information. On the way, Sara tells Michael that she has fallen in love with him and later in the same episode Michael reveals that he feels the same.

With the help of former Fox River warden Henry Pope, Michael and Sara succeed in getting the USB drive in [[Frank Tancredi]]'s private locker. After leaving Kellerman behind, Lincoln, Michael and Sara soon find that the recorded conversation on the USB flash drive could not be used as evidence due to its modified time-stamp, and decide to blackmail Reynolds instead. When this also fails, Michael and Lincoln are forced to escape to [[Panama]]; they are also forced to leave Sara behind after she is arrested. Upon discovering that T-Bag is in [[Panama City]], Michael decides to capture him, which he [[Fin Del Camino (Prison Break)|successfully does]]. When Michael returns his boat with Westmoreland's money to find Lincoln missing, he receives a call from Mahone, who demands the boat and the money in exchange for Lincoln's life. Michael outsmarts Mahone and escapes with Lincoln. At his new boat, Michael and Lincoln are reunited with Sara, who tells them that Lincoln has been exonerated after Kellerman's testimony.

Their happiness is short-lived when [[William Kim|Agent Kim]] ([[Reggie Lee (actor)|Reggie Lee]]) arrives and threatens to kill Lincoln and take Michael to Sona, which causes Sara to shoot him. As the three flee from the scene with the police pursuing them, Michael and Sara separate from Lincoln and end up surrounded in a small isolated [[shack]]. After expressing their love for each other, they leave the shack. Unbeknownst to Sara, Michael confesses to Kim's killing and is arrested in her place. Michael is imprisoned at the [[Penitenciaria Federal de Sona|Penitenciaría Federal de Sona]] (Sona Federal Penitentiary). Michael is the fifth member of the Fox River Eight to be arrested by the authorities, and the second not to die upon interception.

===Season 3===
In the [[Orientación|season premiere]], Michael witnesses a brutal duel between inmates, the usual manner of settling disputes at [[Penitenciaría Federal de Sona|Sona]]. He unintentionally makes an enemy of a convicted influential drug lord in the penitentiary, [[Norman "Lechero" St. John|Lechero]]. Lincoln informs Michael that The Company needs him to break somebody out of Sona ([[List of Prison Break characters#James Whistler|James Whistler]]), and that they have taken Sara and LJ hostage to ensure his cooperation. He began to look for Whistler, only to find that he has a bounty on his head: whoever kills him can receive exoneration from the [[mayor]] of [[Panama City]]. As a result, Whistler had gone into hiding in the sewers. Eventually, he found him and successfully persuades Lechero to remove the bounty on his head.

With seven days to bust Whistler out of prison, Michael tried to take matters into his own hands and uses it to contact Sara and receive a coded message about her location. He relays this information to Linc, who unsuccessfully attempts to rescue Sara and LJ; Sara is apparently killed as a result. Michael then purposely shorts out the power, causing Lechero to call on Michael to fix it. Michael restores power to the prison and also manages to restore power to a previously broken electric fence. It is revealed that Michael fixed the fence so that the electricity will superheat a chemical that Sucre (who was hired as the new [[grave digger]]) sprays on it, as the heated chemical is able to melt steel.

Michael spies on the Sona tower guards but is seen by the second one, due to the lens glare. He observed that at 3:13&amp;nbsp;p.m., there would be a glare which causes one of the guards to look over to the other side. After a small raid takes place, the prisoners are rounded up in the yard. Captain Hurtado questions Michael to the point that he unholsters his pistol and puts it to Michael's head. Whistler manages to intervene on Michael's behalf. With the help of Mahone, Michael concluded that by drugging one of the guard's coffee, they could distract that guard. As the escape plan continues Michael finally learns of Sara's death, which has a devastating impact on him. In a moment of weakness he seems to challenge Whistler to a duel death but this reveals to be only a diversion for the escape. This escape ultimately fails.

When The Company decided to rescue Whistler themselves, Michael foils their plans but he was suspected of such an operation. At the end of the episode he is being escorted out of Sona and is kept in solitary, being interrogated. He evenly relented and told them about Whistler, who then revealed that Gretchen Morgan is in charge of the operation. Later Michael finds out the officers that were with [[Gretchen Morgan|Gretchen]] have been killed. Michael and Whistler are returned to Sona. It was then when they turned to a new escape plan, with the help of Lechero, and that is through an underground tunnel.

Later in the tunnels with Mahone, Whistler and Lechero, he says they need braces to hold up the escape tunnel. Then, when part of the tunnel is about to fall, Michael puts a little piece of metal in to hold it up. Their escape plan was jeopardized with [[Sammy (Prison Break character)|Sammy]] taking over Sona prison and investigating their escape, but Sammy was killed after the tunnel fell upon him. It is then revealed that Michael killed Sammy by taking out that little metal piece. [[Luis "McGrady" Gallego|McGrady]] joined the team in the escape. Later Michael, Whistler, Mahone, and McGrady escape from Sona, with Lechero, T-Bag and Bellick caught during the escape.

Michael successfully tricks Gretchen into giving LJ and [[Sofia Lugo|Sofia]] back safely. When a shootout begins out a museum in Panama, Michael grabs the gun from Linc's car and has Gretchen in his sights, but she escapes when police start to shoot at her. Later on outside the hospital, LJ gave him the same origami rose that Michael had given to Sara on her birthday. Fueled by revenge, he bids farewell to his family as he goes on a solo mission to hunt down Gretchen.

===Season 4===
In the [[Scylla (Prison Break episode)|season premiere]], Michael has tracked down Gretchen and Whistler to [[Los Angeles]] as he prepares to avenge Sara's death. When Michael has both Gretchen and Whistler at gunpoint, Gretchen reveals to him that she had lied about killing Sara Tancredi. Unsure whether or not to believe her, Michael contacts Lincoln and then Bruce. When both Michael and Lincoln get arrested, [[Don Self]] tells them that they can either bring down The Company and get Scylla (A key card that stores every bit of information about The Company – essentially their "little black book") or go to jail. They refuse and are bailed out by Bruce. Bruce takes them to Sara where Michael and she joyfully reunite. A hired assassin named Wyatt eventually hunts them down and tries to assassinate them at Sara's safe house. It is then that Michael and everyone decide to take Self's offer. They are joined by Mahone, Sucre, and Bellick in their mission. To blend in with the crowds, Michael gets his tattoos removed via laser surgery. Throughout further episodes, Michael is seen to be experiencing health problems, getting nosebleeds and suddenly clutching his head in pain. He hides these from Lincoln and Sara, but in the episode "Safe and Sound" Michael experiences a bloody nose that he could not hide from Lincoln. Michael tells his brother "It's not a big deal." and Lincoln replies "It was a big deal when you were thirteen..." It appears that Michael shared the condition with his mother; she during her childhood had frequent nosebleeds that stopped but resumed shortly before she died at the age of 31 of a brain aneurysm. This death was a discrepancy that was never directly explained when she turned out to be alive later in the season, however based on a statement by the General regarding prior results of a surgery, and later information revealed about Michael's mother, the explanation of the discrepancy is subtly implied. Michael is experiencing nosebleeds for the first time since 13 and is about to turn 31. In the episode "The Legend", Michael is no longer able to hide his sickness as he collapses in the warehouse. Sara takes Michael to the hospital where the doctors diagnoses him with a [[hypothalamic hamartoma]], advising that emergency surgery is required or he might die.

Unwilling to go into surgery until they get Scylla, Michael receives temporary treatment from Sara and goes onwards with their plans to break into The Company. Although the group eventually succeeds in getting Scylla, Self betrays them and takes it for himself to try to sell it. Michael, however, had taken a small piece of Scylla and Self needs that piece to make Scylla complete. Self goes back to find Michael and shoots the warehouse and a gas tanker to try to force them out. Fortunately, Lincoln was not in the warehouse at the time, and upon discovering Self's car outside, he finds Self at the top of a building and knocks him unconscious. They bring Self in and are about to get Scylla when Gretchen holds the group at gunpoint, allowing Self and herself to escape. Everyone except Mahone head to the hotel Self and Gretchen are staying at. Michael tampers with the ladder outside so that when Self tries to escape, it comes loose and Self falls to the ground. Michael takes this opportunity to grab Scylla from an unconscious Self, but as he is running away his nose starts to bleed profusely. He begins losing his balance and blacks out, falling to the ground. Self then catches up and takes back Scylla. As he is preparing to shoot Michael, Company agents appear and start shooting at Self. Self jumps into Gretchen's van and they escape. The Company agents lift an unconscious Michael into their van and drive away, with Lincoln running after them.

Michael is then shown in a hospital bed, connected to many machines. A hand rests on his, and it is revealed that this is General Krantz. Lincoln visits The Company's headquarters and asks General Krantz to allow him to see his brother. The General leads Lincoln to Michael, assuring him that Michael is under the best medical care and that The Company's technology is years ahead of those currently provided to the general public. He also tells Lincoln that the only way they will operate and save Michael is if Lincoln brings Scylla back. In addition, General Krantz gives Lincoln a folder labeled "TOMBSTONE II", telling him that it is "added incentive." With Mahone arrested by Agent Lang and Agent Wheeler, it is now up to Lincoln, Sucre, and Sara to retrieve Scylla from Don Self and Gretchen and to save Michael.

With Sara by his side, Michael wakes up disoriented and weak. He asks her which hospital he is in, but Sara merely assures him he does not need to worry about it and that there are good doctors here to treat him. While Lincoln and Sucre go after Scylla, Sara stays with Michael and watches over him while he undergoes surgery. The procedure that The Company doctors use on Michael is nothing like anything Sara has seen before. General Krantz tells her that while the procedure is experimental, it has been used once before on a patient who ended up living a long and happy life. Because of the surgery, all of Michael's senses become active at the same time, causing him to have his life flash before his eyes. He suddenly sees himself back in his old cell at Fox River, with Charles Westmoreland greeting him. While conversing with Westmoreland and trying to figure out the truth behind Scylla in his subconscious, the Michael in surgery is dying and begins to flatline. The Company doctor injects an unknown serum into Michael as Sara panics and rushes to Michael's side, telling him not to give up. After finally realizing what Scylla really is and hearing Sara's voice, Michael wakes up.

Later on, Michael tells Sara that he had a dream about Scylla, and he explains that Scylla is not actually The Company's little black book, but knowledge regarding a chemical combination that can produce energy equivalent to that of the sun's. Lincoln visits Michael shortly after, who is shocked to find out that Lincoln is willing to work with The Company to retrieve Scylla. He attempts to convince Lincoln to stop what he is doing and that The Company cannot be trusted, but Lincoln gives Michael the "TOMBSTONE II" folder and reveals to him that their mother used to work for The Company before she died, and that he is just "following the family business." A preview after the season 4 finale shows Lincoln on the phone with Michael and says he will stop at nothing to get Scylla. Michael replies saying he will stop at nothing to stop Lincoln from succeeding.

Michael and Sara are seen exiting a pizza restaurant when a Company assassin tries to kill them. They escape. They then bribe a truck driver to let them hitchhike with him, fearing police. He calls Lincoln and tells him he will stop him from getting Scylla and reveals that their mother is alive. The truck is eventually pulled over and searched for Michael and Sara, by an unidentified man. He pretends he does not see anything and he murders the truck driver, placing a phone call stating that he has them. Michael and Sara try to call Lincoln, but they lose the signal and the back lifter is stuck so they smash a vending machine to open the side door and they escape with the guy chasing after them. Michael kills him and takes a note from him asking who sent him. The guy's last words were, "Not Krantz." He then dies.

Michael and Sara stay at one of Sara's old friend, Deb's vacation apartment, with whom she went to med school. Michael and Sara check the note they took from their abductor. It reads: I10R4AZMS=I-10 near route 4 in Arizona Michael Scofield. The back side reads B2348ROCKWELL1630VS, which they do not understand. Michael texts Lincoln to meet up with him, but instead Mahone comes. Mahone asks if Michael can explain his plan against The Company and Michael refuses to, since Mahone is working with The Company. Michael learns that Christina ordered their abductor to bring them to her, but not kill them. This provides greater incentive to Michael to want to take down The Company. They head to Rockwell Avenue, where they find a car, gun, money,a cellphone and directions to a location they need to go. They head to an airport and check through a flight log list for the initials VS; they discover the name Vincent Sandinsky. They abduct Sandinsky and a car chase ensues. They are captured and Christina orders Michael and Sara to be killed; before they can be executed, The Company agents are killed by Lincoln, Mahone, and Self. Lincoln advises Michael to leave, but he refuses. Lincoln takes Sandinsky with him as a hostage. Michael and Sara, however, took Sandinsky's cellphone which reveals he and Christina used to be lovers. Also in this episode (Vs.) it is revealed Sara is pregnant with Michael's child.

In the next episode, "S.O.B.", Michael calls Lincoln and informs him that Sandinsky knows everything. Lincoln advises him to leave Miami, but Michael still refuses. Michael calls Christina and wants to meet with her to make an arrangement if he gets Scylla. She agrees, and, along with her men, heads to the warehouse where Michael and Sara are. They search the warehouse and Michael puts baggies filled with chemicals inside Christina's SUV and puts the air conditioning on, setting it to full. When Christina and her men return to the car, she starts it and when the heat hits the bags, the chemicals evaporate, suffocating the occupants. Michael and Sara take this opportunity to abduct Christina and tie her up and put her in the trunk. When she regains consciousness, and she reveals to Michael that Lincoln is not his brother. His real parents, who were Company agents, were killed. Aldo adopted Lincoln when he was three. She never loved Lincoln like she loved Michael. Michael says Lincoln was a brother more than she was a mother: She left, he stayed, he fed him, kept him off the streets and kept him in school. According to the writer of the episode, Karyn Usher, on the episode audio commentary, what she told Michael was in fact a lie. Christina does not want Michael to keep saving Lincoln. Michael demands to know where Lincoln is, and she does not answer until Michael attempts to torture her. She reveals the location at an Energy Conference. Michael leaves, leaving Sara to watch Christina. Michael meets Lincoln at the Energy Conference where the Indian Prime Minister's son, Naveen Banerjee, is assassinated by Christina's men. Lincoln and Michael reunite, whereby Michael reveals to Lincoln that Christina set them up. The police then pursue them.

In the episode "Killing Your Number", Michael is forced to save Lincoln from the clutches of his mother, or save Sara from the clutches of The Company. Michael is forced to try to kill his mother, but, when the gun is out of ammunition, Sara kills Christina, saving Michael. He manages to save both and hands Scylla to Paul Kellerman. After this Michael, Lincoln, Sara, Mahone, and Sucre are exonerated. After Sara and Michael have a thoughtful walk on the beach about the new baby coming, we see four years have passed and Sara and her child are in Panama. After her son, Michael, receives a temporary tattoo, she tell him that they are going to see his father. Sara, her child, Lincoln, Sucre, and Mahone meet at a beach, and walk up to a grave labeled "Michael J. Scofield" and Sara places flowers (lilies) on Michael's gravestone.

===''The Final Break''===
The movie starts with Michael and Sara getting married. They have a celebration at a restaurant by the beach, which is interrupted by a squadron of FBI agents  who pull up to the area. They arrest Sara for the murder of Christina Hamilton (Christina Scofield). The only footage they had of the scene was where you could only see Sara shooting Christina, but not Christina's gun. Sara ends up in prison right across from the General and T-Bag. Michael is not allowed to see Sara as the FBI suspect he is planning an escape. As Michael, Lincoln, Sucre, and Mahone plan the escape, Mahone admits that he was approached to be an under cover for the FBI to get his job back.

In prison Sara is almost assassinated with rat-poison as General Krantz put a bounty of $100,000 on Sara. A man in the male prison tells T-Bag that his girl can do it for $40,000, however when her and Sara duel Gretchen comes in and kills Sara's attacker. When Gretchen figures out Sara is escaping, Gretchen tells Sara that she wants to come, and uses her saving of Sara as proof she can be trusted. In a secret code, Michael tells Sara to meet him at the chapel for the escape.

Mahone tells the FBI that Michael decided to parachute into the prison. As a dummy drops in by parachute Michael sneaks under the FBI agent's car who is in charge of preventing the escape. Sara and Gretchen try to get to the Chapel by starting a riot. In the midst of the riot Gretchen gets shanked by another prisoner. Sara and Gretchen quietly sneak to the chapel, however Gretchen gets caught without revealing Sara's location. Sara continues and meets up with Michael. They eventually get to the exit point, but when Michael's key card doesn't work as expected, he tells Sara to carry on without him. Michael grabs the generator wires and puts two together to knock out the power. The door opens, but Sara sees an explosion as she leaves. Sara is unable to speak and Mahone informs everyone he is gone and they need to leave. Upon leaving, Mahone shows Sara and Lincoln Michael's medical records that he did not have much longer to live, and gave them a DVD on which Michael expresses his love to them both as well as his unborn child.

===Season 5===
Seven years after his apparent death, Michael [[Prison Break (season 5)#Episodes|resurfaces]] in Yemen, held in Ogygia Prison. A photo of Michael is sent to Fox River Penitentiary, given to the recently released Theodore Bagwell. Taking the photo, Lincoln travels to Yemen, alongside old friend C-Note. Michael is shown to be under a new alias, Kaniel Outis, does not acknowledge Lincoln or C-Note, claiming not to know them. It is gradually revealed that Michael, along with a fellow prisoner named Whip, are undercover CIA operatives, but were betrayed by a mastermind agent known as Poseidon.

==Concept and creation==

===Character creation===
The character was conceived after Paul Scheuring, ''Prison Break'''s creator, developed an idea by another producer, about a man who deliberately imprisons himself to break somebody out. From the initial proposal, Scheuring then justified the character and story by making him a [[structural engineer]] who worked at the architecture firm that had access to the prison's blueprints. The name was originally used in [[Roald Dahl]]'s collection of short stories, ''Someone like you'', as Michael Scofield.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/inside-prison-break-chain-male/2006/01/28/1138319488697.html Inside Prison Break: Chain male]" ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''.

===Portrayal===
Michael J Scofield is portrayed by [[Wentworth Miller]]. For most of the first season of the show, Miller utilized a limited range of facial expressions which generated both positive and negative criticisms. It was for this performance in the first season that Miller was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]]. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' criticized Miller's performance as being "the most oppressive" and how "the actor apparently thinks it looks cool for him always to be scanning the surroundings..."&lt;ref name=wpost&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/28/AR2005082801134.html 'Prison Break': Sharpen Up Those Spoons]" ''[[The Washington Post]]''.

In the show's second season, the character of Michael Scofield shows a wider range of emotions as Miller explains, "He's going to have some lighter, more colorful shades... now that he's off with his brother, around whom I think Michael is willing to show a side of himself that he's not with others, there's a lot more that I can explore."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.canmag.com/news/4/21/4782 Wentworth Miller on Prison Break Season Two]" ''CanMag''.

===Tattoo===
The tattoo, which covers the entire upper body of Michael Scofield, is featured extensively in the first season of the show and to a lesser extent in the second season. It contributes a major part to the plot of the series, containing various details of the protagonist's plan to escape from prison and from the country. Incorporated within the tattoo are the blueprints of the prison in which the protagonists are incarcerated during the first season.

Wentworth Miller, who plays Michael Scofield, has commented that questions about the tattoo are amongst the most frequently asked questions when he is interviewed about the show.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, M., "[http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2006/03/wentworth_mille.html Wentworth Miller: Do not ask about the tattoo]", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. March 16, 2006. Retrieved on March 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the first episode of season four, Michael refused to take any painkillers during a night-long session in which the tattoos were removed by laser.

Designed by Tom Berg and created by Tinsley Transfers, the tattoo took around five hours to be applied onto Miller. When the entire tattoo does not need to be shown, for example, in scenes where the actor is wearing a T-shirt, only the forearm pieces of the tattoo are applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Prison Break: Season One – "Beyond the Ink" featurette|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox|date=August 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
In the series pilot, Michael's jail entrance form held by Bellick shows that the character was born on September 8, 1978 in [[Toledo, Ohio]] (and the date in the ''Prison Break: The Conspiracy'' game states July 2, 1972. The birthdate is inconsistent with the characters' dialogue in later episodes. In "[[By the Skin and the Teeth]]", Michael remarks to Lincoln that their fathers left them thirty years ago. Since the series is set in the year 2005,&lt;ref&gt;"[[Wash (Prison Break episode)|Wash]]", ''Prison Break'' season 2 episode 18.&lt;/ref&gt; the birth date shown on the prop cannot be considered as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]. Thus Michael is 27 years old since last episode in Season 3, "[[Vamonos]]", took place on June 24, 2005. This is according to the expired one week [[ultimatum]] given by The Company to Michael for breaking out [[James Whistler (Prison Break character)|James Whistler]]. His age is stated by Lincoln for the first time in "[[Five the Hard Way (Prison Break)|Five the Hard Way]]" as 31, meaning all the facts above cannot be canon. It's also stated Michael is born in 1976 in the episode "[[The Mother Lode (Prison Break)|The Mother Lode]]", but in "[[Killing Your Number (Prison Break)|Killing Your Number]]" it's retconned to October 8, 1974.

Before imprisonment into Fox River State Penitentiary Michael lived at 440 West Ardmore Avenue, Apartment 11 Chicago, Illinois 60660.

==Characteristics==
Michael is described as "always scanning the surroundings", and "has the silky voice of a sociopath (and) the resigned stance of a long-distance runner" and projected an unflappable determination that confounded his fellow prisoners, as, being close to Abruzzi or T-Bag or Bellick, he could not afford to be vulnerable or even appear human. Later, following the escape, Michael, now off with his brother, around whom Michael was willing to show a side of himself that he was not with the others; something that is lighter and more colorful. Michael often is outwardly taciturn and stoic, rarely allowing the dangerous element he's frequently surrounded by to penetrate his thoughts.
Michael has been clinically diagnosed with low latent inhibition, a condition in which his brain is more open to incoming stimuli in the surrounding environment. As a result of this condition, he is unable to block out periphery information and instead processes every aspect and detail of any given stimulus. This, combined with a high IQ (as a psychiatrist explains) theoretically makes him a creative genius. His intelligence is well noticed even by his enemies e.g. with Mahone in Season 2 making various comments about Michael's intelligence, even holding a certain admiration to him after successfully breaking out of two prisons (Fox River and Sona). He is even offered a place in The Company.

Due to a feeling of abandonment and abuse during childhood, Michael developed and has very low, or absolutely no sense of, self-worth. With the low latent inhibition, this has made him become very attuned to all the suffering around him. As a result of being unable to block out other people's suffering, he is extremely empathetic and altruistic towards other people's emotions; this explains Michael's desire to make huge sacrifices to help others – he is more concerned with other people's welfare than his own. This particular attribute is apparently the product of his detrimental experience during childhood, where, as a child, his abusive foster father would often beat him and have him locked up inside a closet; and by doing so, Michael's eyes begin to adjust to the darkened environment, allowing him to scan objects around him which he can use for his own convenience.

Michael had a very strong moral sense and was cool and reasonable. He knew that if he or his allies turn to kill rather than subdue their enemies, they will gradually lose themselves and eventually everything. Bellick, "T-Bag", Whistler and overall Gretchen, all people with much blood on their hands are only alive or survived as long as they did because Michael spared them.

Michael's enhanced creative ability allowed him to design a tattoo with a hidden blueprint of Fox River Penitentiary that normal people couldn't discern. Over the course of four months, Michael had specific sections of the prison tattooed onto his upper body, hidden within gothic imagery. Each part of his tattoo had to be precise, which provoked the tattooist's comment to Mahone about Michael being a "detail Nazi" and that the tattoo was "some sort of inside joke" that only he got.

Michael was also shown to be meticulous and well-prepared as he used his knowledge and intellect to achieve each step of his escape plan. With time, however, Michael developed (or was possibly born with) improvisation techniques. Tossed into Sona, he developed an escape plan, which ultimately fails. The failure leads to another escape plan which Michael realizes is a threat to his and Lincoln's safety, and stops it. After he escapes Sona and brings down The Company Michael orchestrates from the outside a plan to break Sara out of prison in a relatively short amount of time. The plan is successful but costs him his life in the process. This event is present in the movie ''Prison Break: The Final Break''. Despite this, the return of ''Prison Break'' in 2016 casts doubt over his fate, with Garry Newman suggesting that this particular event in the straight to video film is likely to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ward|first1=Rachel|title=Prison Break returns to TV|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11789133/Prison-Break-returns-to-TV.html|website=Telegraph UK|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muḥammad 'Abduh''' (1849 – 11 July 1905) (also spelled '''Mohammed Abduh''', {{lang-ar|محمد عبده}}) was an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[Islam]]ic jurist, religious scholar and liberal reformer, regarded as one of the key founding figures of [[Islamic Modernism]], sometimes called Neo-[[Muʿtazila|Mu’tazilism]] after the medieval Islamic school of theology based on rationalism, [[Muʿtazila]].&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed H. Al-Rahim (January 2006). "Islam and Liberty", ''Journal of Democracy'' 17 (1), p. 166-169.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote, among other things, "Treatise on the Oneness of God", and a commentary on the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

== Biography ==
{{Salafi|Founders}}
Muhammad Abduh was born in 1849 to a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] father&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Adams|first=Charles Clarence|year=1933|chapter=Muhammad Abduh: Biography|title=Islam and Modernism in Egypt, Volume 10|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=0415209080|page=18|quote=True, his father 'Abduh ibn Hasan Khair Allah, came from a family of Turkish origin that had settled in the village of Mahallat Nasr in the Buhairah Province at some remote time in the past...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arab people|Arab]] mother&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hourani|first=Albert|title=Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age|year=1962|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Great Britain|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Lower [[Egypt]] (i.e. the [[Nile Delta]]).&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; He also had [[Kurds|Kurdish]] roots.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Goldschmidt, ''Biographical Dictionary of Modern Egypt'', Lynne Rienner Publishers (2000), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; His family was of the Egyptian elite. His father was part of the [[Umad]], or the local ruling elite. His mother was part of the Ashraf. He was educated in [[Tanta]] at a private school.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; When he turned thirteen, he was sent to the Aḥmadī mosque, which was one of the largest educational institutions in Egypt. A while later Abduh ran away from school and got married. He enrolled at [[al-Azhar University]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hourani|first=Albert|title=Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age|year=1962|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Great Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1866.&lt;ref name=KG&gt;Kügelgen, Anke von. "ʿAbduh, Muḥammad." Encyclopaedia of Islam, v.3. Edited by: Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas and Everett Rowson. Brill, 2009. Syracuse University. 23 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Abduh studied logic, philosophy and [[Islamic mysticism]] at the [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]]. He was a student of [[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]],&lt;ref&gt;Kedourie, E. (1997). ''Afghani and 'Abduh: An Essay on Religious Unbelief and Political Activism in Modern Islam'', London: Frank Cass. {{ISBN|0-7146-4355-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a philosopher and Muslim religious reformer who advocated [[Pan-Islamism]] to resist [[European colonialism]]. Under al-Afghani's influence, Abduh combined journalism, politics, and his own fascination in Islamic mystical spirituality. Al-Afghani taught Abduh about the problems of Egypt and the Islamic world and about the technological achievements of the [[Western world|West]].

In 1877, Abduh was granted the degree of 'Alim ("teacher") and he started to teach logic, theology and ethics at al-Azhar. In 1878, he was appointed professor of history at Cairo's teachers' training college [[Dar al-Ulum]], later incorporated into [[Cairo University]]. He was also appointed to teach [[Arabic]] at the Khedivial School of Languages.&lt;ref name=KG/&gt;

Abduh was appointed editor and chief of ''al-Waqāʾiʿ al-Miṣriyya'', the official state newspaper. He was dedicated to reforming all aspects of Egyptian society and believed that education was the best way to achieve this goal. He was in favor of a good religious education, which would strengthen a child’s morals, and a scientific education, which would nurture a child’s ability to reason. In his articles he criticized corruption, superstition, and the luxurious lives of the rich.&lt;ref name=KG/&gt;

In 1879, due to his political activity, [[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]] was exiled and Abduh was exiled to his home village. The following year he was granted control of the national gazette and used this as a means to spread his anti-colonial ideas, and the need for social and religious reforms.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; He was exiled from Egypt by the British in 1882 for six years, for supporting the Egyptian nationalist [[Urabi Revolt|revolt]] led by [[Ahmed Orabi]] in 1879. He had stated that every society should be allowed to choose a suitable form of government based on its history and its present circumstances.&lt;ref name=KG/&gt; Abduh spent several years in Ottoman  [[Lebanon]], where he helped establish an Islamic educational system. In 1884 he moved to [[Paris|Paris, France]] where he joined al-Afghani in publishing ''The Firmest Bond'' (al-Urwah al-Wuthqa), an Islamic revolutionary journal that promoted anti-British views.  Abduh also visited Britain and discussed the state of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] with high-ranking officials. In 1885, after brief stays in [[England]] and [[Tunisia]], he returned to [[Beirut]], as a teacher,&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; and was surrounded by scholars from different religious backgrounds. During his stay there he dedicated his efforts toward furthering respect and friendship between [[Islam]], [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]].&lt;ref name=KG/&gt;

When he returned to Egypt in 1888, Abduh began his legal career. He was appointed judge in the Courts of First Instance of the Native Tribunals and in 1891, he became a consultative member of the Court of Appeal.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; In 1899, he was appointed [[Dar al-Ifta al-Misriyyah|Grand Mufti of Egypt]], the highest Islamic title, and he held this position until he died.  As a judge, he was involved in many decisions, some of which were considered liberal such as the ability to utilize meat butchered by non-Muslims and the acceptance of loan interest. His liberal views, endeared him to the British, in particular [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]]; however it also caused a rift between him and the khedive [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas Hilmi]] and the nationalist leader [[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamil]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; While he was in Egypt, Abduh founded a religious society, became president of a society for the revival of Arab sciences and worked towards reforming [[al-Azhar University]] by putting forth proposals to improve examinations, the curriculum and the working conditions for both professors and students. He travelled a great deal and met with European scholars in [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University]]. He studied French law and read a great many European and Arab works in the libraries of [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]]. The conclusions he drew from his travels were that Muslims suffer from ignorance about their own religion and the despotism of unjust rulers.&lt;ref name=KG/&gt;

Muhammad Abduh died in [[Alexandria]] on 11 July 1905. People from all around the world sent their condolences.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Thought==

Muhammad Abduh argued that Muslims could not simply rely on the interpretations of texts provided by medieval clerics; they needed to use reason to keep up with changing times. He said that in Islam, man was not created to be led by a bridle, but that man was given intelligence so that he could be guided by knowledge. According to Abduh, a teacher’s role was to direct men towards study. He believed that Islam encouraged men to detach from the world of their ancestors and that Islam reproved the slavish imitation of tradition. He said that the two greatest possessions relating to religion that man was graced with were independence of will and independence of thought and opinion. It was with the help of these tools that he could attain happiness. He believed that the growth of western civilization in Europe was based on these two principles. He thought that Europeans were roused to act after a large number of them were able to exercise their choice and to seek out facts with their minds.&lt;ref&gt;Gelvin , J. L. (2008). The Modern Middle East (2nd ed., pp. 161-162). New York: Oxford university Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
His Muslim opponents refer to him as an infidel; however, his followers called him a sage, a reviver of religion and a reforming leader. He is conventionally graced with the epithets “al-Ustādh al-Imām” and “al-Shaykh al-Muftī”.  In his works, he portrays God as educating humanity from its childhood through its youth and then on to adulthood. According to him, Islam is the only religion whose dogmas can be proven by reasoning. Abduh does not advocate returning to the early stages of Islam. He was against [[polygamy]] and thought that it was an archaic custom. He believed in a form of Islam that would liberate men from enslavement, provide equal rights for all human beings, abolish the religious scholar’s monopoly on [[exegesis]] and abolish [[racial discrimination]] and religious compulsion.&lt;ref name=KG/&gt;

Abduh regularly called for better friendship between religious communities. He made great efforts to preach harmony between [[Sunni]]s and [[Shia]]s. Broadly
speaking, he preached brotherhood between all schools of thought in Islam. However, he criticized what he perceived as errors such as [[superstition]]s coming from popular [[Sufism]].&lt;ref name=Benzine&gt;Benzine, Rachid. Les nouveaux penseurs de l'islam, p. 43-44.&lt;/ref&gt; As Christianity was the second biggest religion in [[Egypt]], he devoted special efforts towards friendship between Muslims and Christians. He had many Christian friends and many a time he stood up to defend [[Copts]].&lt;ref name=Benzine/&gt; During the [[Urabi revolt]], some Muslim mobs had misguidedly attacked a number of Copts resulting from their anger against European colonialism. Abduh also had meetings in Baghdad with the son of [[Baha'ism]]'s founder and then spiritual leader, [[Abdu'l Baha]], who he had a generally positive view of - although it was asserted by his students that he was unaware of the extra-Quranic religious scripture or status of [[Baha'ullah]] as a prophet in the faith and viewed it as a reformation of [[Shi'ism]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan R.I. Cole. ''[http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/articles/A-E/cole/abduh/abduh.htm Muhammad `Abduh and Rashid Rida: A Dialogue on the Bahá'í Faith.]'' World Order Vol. 15, nos. 3-4 (Spring/Summer 1981):7-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abduh's collected works have been compiled and published in five volumes by [[Muhammad Imarah]].

== Freemason ==

At the age of 28 Abduh joined a [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] lodge, the Kawkab Al-Sharq (Planet of the East). Its members included [[Tewfik Pasha|Prince Tawfiq]], the Khedive's son and heir, leading personalities such as [[Mohamed Sherif Pasha|Muhammad Sharif Pasha]], who had been a minister, Sulayman Abaza Pasha and [[Saad Zaghloul|Saad Zaghlul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/341054| title=What did Muhammad Abduh do?| publisher=Arab News| access-date=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A. M. Broadbent declared that "Sheikh Abdu was no dangerous fanatic or religious enthusiast, for he belonged to the broadest school of Moslem thought, held a political creed akin to pure republicanism, and was a zealous Master of a Masonic Lodge." &lt;ref&gt;Raafat, Samir. "Freemasonry in Egypt: Is it still around?" Insight Magazine, March 1, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with Masonic principles, Abduh sought to encourage unity with all religious traditions. He stated that,

"I hope to see the two great religions, Islam and Christianity hand-in-hand, embracing each other. Then the Torah and the Bible and the Qur'an will become books supporting one another being read everywhere, and respected by every nation." He added that he was “looking forward to seeing Muslims read the Torah and the Bible." &lt;ref&gt;Muhammad 'Abduh, Islam and Christianity, in Waqf Ikhlas, The Religion Reformers in Islam, Istanbul, 1995, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

'Abduh was asked why he and (his teacher) Afghani had become Masons. He replied that it was for a "political and social purpose".&lt;ref&gt;Rida, "Tatimmat," p. 402.  Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 92, No. 1 (Jan. - Mar., 1972), pp. 25-35&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abduh and the Bahá'í Faith ==

Like his teacher, Abduh was associated with the [[Bahá'í Faith]], which had made deliberate efforts to spread the faith to Egypt, establishing themselves in Alexandria and Cairo beginning in the late 1860s. [[Rashid Rida]] asserts that during his visits to Beirut, [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] would attend Abduh's study sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cole |first= Juan R.I. | authorlink= Juan Cole |date= 1981  |title= Muhammad `Abduh and Rashid Rida: A Dialogue on the Baha'i Faith |url= http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/articles/A-E/cole/abduh/abduh.htm  |journal= World Order  |publisher= |volume= 15 |issue= 3 |page= 11 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two men met at a time when they had similar goals of religious reform and were in opposition to the Ottoman ''[[ulama]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Scharbrodt |first= Oliver  |date= 2008 |title= Islam and the Bahá'í Faith: A Comparative Study of Muhammad 'Abduh and 'Abdul-Baha 'Abbas |url= |location= |publisher=Routledge |page= |isbn= 9780203928578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cole |first= Juan R.I. | authorlink= Juan Cole |date= 1983 |title= Rashid Rida on the Bahai Faith: A Utilitarian Theory of the Spread of Religions |url= http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahai/2000/rida.htm |journal= Arab Studies Quarterly |publisher= |volume= 5 |issue= 2 |page= 278 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the meetings of `Abdu'l-Bahá and Muhammad 'Abduh, [[Shoghi Effendi]] asserts that "His several interviews with the well-known Shaykh Muhammad ‘Abdu served to enhance immensely the growing prestige of the community and spread abroad the fame of its most distinguished member."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA| page=193 |isbn=0-87743-020-9

Indeed, he is a great man; he is the man who deserves to have the epithet applied to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cole |first= Juan R.I. | authorlink= Juan Cole |date= 1983 |title= Rashid Rida on the Bahai Faith: A Utilitarian Theory of the Spread of Religions |url= http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahai/2000/rida.htm |journal= Arab Studies Quarterly |publisher= |volume= 5 |issue= 2 |page= 282 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They appeared on 29 November 2005 in the [[Bow Street Magistrates' Court]] in [[London]]. They were remanded on [[bail]], to return to the court on 10 January for a committal hearing.

The charges against the pair relate to the [[Al Jazeera bombing memo|alleged leak of a document]] containing what purports to be a discussion between [[Tony Blair]] and [[George W. Bush]] at one point. It is alleged this document shows that Blair had to dissuade Bush from bombing [[Al Jazeera]] in [[Qatar]].

On 10 January 2006 their defence lawyer was shown the secret [[Al Jazeera bombing memo]] and declared it posed no threat to [[national security]]. He vowed to have it made public by the court. The case would return to court on 24 January.

The trial was due to begin on 9 October 2006. However, on that date the judge ruled the hearing should be in secret. It was then reported that the trial itself would begin on 18 April 2007.

In arguing for the trial to remain secret, the government claimed the memo "could have a serious impact upon the international relations" of the UK. and that the "risk is of such magnitude to outweigh the interest of open public justice."

The trial began on 18 April 2007 in the [[Old Bailey]] court. Elaborate procedures were imposed to ensure secrecy, including asking barristers to remove their wigs when restricted information was being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 10 May 2007 Keogh was found guilty on two counts of making a "damaging disclosure" by revealing the memo and was sentenced to 6 months in jail. He was also ordered to pay £5000 in costs to the prosecution. O'Connor was sentenced to 3 months in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Otto Heino''' (April 20, 1915 – July 16, 2009) and '''Vivika Heino''' (June 27, 1910 – September 1, 1995)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com Social Security Death Index]&lt;/ref&gt; were artists working in [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]]. They collaborated as a husband-and-wife team for thirty-five years, signing their pots ''Vivika + Otto'', regardless of who actually made them.

== Otto Heino ==
One of twelve children born of Finnish immigrants, Lena and August Heino, in [[East Hampton, Connecticut]], [[United States]]. His family ran a dairy farm in quiet farm country. Otto Heino's involvement with ceramics began while serving in the [[U.S. Air Force]] in England; during a military leave, he spent several days watching [[Bernard Leach]] throw pots. Following his return to the US, he used his GI Bill funding in 1949 to study ceramics at the League of New Hampshire Arts and Crafts, in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], [[New Hampshire]]. There he met Vivika, his teacher, whom he was married to in 1950.

===Military service===
During World War II, Otto Heino served five years of active duty in the USAAF where he briefly worked on engines at a Rolls-Royce factory in England.  He was assigned to the [[357th Fighter Group]], the "Yoxford Boys", based in Leiston, Suffolk.  Due to his knowledge of Rolls-Royce engines, T/Sgt Otto Heino served as a crew chief, maintaining the group's [[P-51 Mustang]] fighters.  Although he worked on several Mustangs, Otto is best known for being the personal crew chief of [[Bud Anderson|Bud Anderson's]] P-51 Mustangs, all of which were named "Old Crow".  Never once in 116 combat missions did Anderson abort or return early due to mechanical problems, something Anderson attributes greatly to the dedicated and tireless work ethic of Otto and the rest of his ground crew. Aside from being a crew chief, Otto Heino, at one point, served as a waist gunner in a [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]. He was shot down twice over Germany, escaping certain death largely due in part to his Teutonic name and appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Keeps, David A.

===Death===
Otto Heino died of [[acute renal failure]] at [[Community Memorial Hospital of San Buenaventura|Community Memorial Hospital]] in [[Ventura, California]] on July 16, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-otto-heino21-2009jul21,0,1590279.story Otto Heino dies at 94; master potter created 'hearty and gutsy' pieces] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Retrieved on July 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vivika Heino ==
Vivika was born Vivien Place in [[Caledonia, New York|Caledonia]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. In the mid 1930s, after getting a teaching degree at the Rochester Normal School, she spent two years with the [[Works Progress Administration]] theatre project, and headed the [[National Youth Administration]] in [[San Francisco]]. Discovering clay at this time, she studied at the [[California School of Fine Arts]] (now the [[San Francisco Art Institute]]), and with [[Glen Lukens]] at the [[University of Southern California]]. Lukens, a highly respected ceramist renowned for his glazes, gave her the opportunity to explore colored clays, develop new glazes, and experiment with raw materials. (In later years, she and Otto were to devote a day a week to measuring, mixing, and testing new glazes.) Her pots were exhibited at the 1939 [[Golden Gate International Exposition]], in San Francisco.

Vivien Place started using the name Vivika while studying at the Swedish Applied Arts, in San Francisco, where teacher Margaret Gravandar thought everyone should have a Swedish name.  (Even her mother started calling her that.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Levin | first=Elaine | title=Vivika and Otto Heino Oral History Interview | publisher=Smithsonian Institution | date=1981-03-04 | work=Archives of American Art | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/heino81.htm | accessdate=2006-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Vivika received an M.F.A. from [[New York State College of Ceramics]] at [[Alfred University]], [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred]], New York.  She was the second M.F.A. graduate from the ceramics program there (following [[Daniel Rhodes]] in 1940).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Smith | first=Paul J. | title=Interview with Susan Peterson | publisher=Smithsonian Institution | date=2004-03-01 | work=Archives of American Art | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/peters04.htm | accessdate=2006-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Otto + Vivika ==
Otto and Vivika moved to California in 1952, where Vivika replaced Glen Lukens, head of ceramics department of the University of Southern California, during his sabbatical; she remained there for three years. Otto also taught at the university during this time.  Also in 1952, she became a technical advisor for [[Twentieth Century Fox]] Studios, and she and Otto made 751 pots for the movie ''The Egyptian'' in 1953.

In 1955, as they prepared to return home to [[Hopkinton, New Hampshire]], she was invited to reorganize the ceramics department at the Chouinard Art Institute in [[Los Angeles]], and remained there for eight years. During that time, they remodelled a store on Hoover Street into a studio and began selling their work directly to the public, with success. Otto worked full-time as a potter while Vivika taught; during the summer, they switched roles, Otto teaching and Vivika producing pottery.

Vivika helped organise and became a board member of the Southern California Designer Craftsmen, and later a trustee for the southwestern region of the [[American Craft Council]]. She travelled to nearby states to help organize craft groups, something she had experience with from her days at the League of New Hampshire Arts and Crafts.

After an eleven-year stay in California (originally expected to last two), Vivika accepted in 1963 an offer to teach at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]], in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. In 1965, the Heinos reopened their home and studio in [[Hopkinton, New Hampshire]].

Teaching was a very important part of Vivika's life. Although he also enjoyed teaching, Otto preferred studio production. Over the years, Vivika accepted a number of short-term teaching assignments, punctuated by periods of studio work with Otto.

&lt;blockquote&gt;What you give away you have forever; what you keep to yourself, you lose." (Vivika Heino)&lt;ref name="CeramicsMonthly"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Levin | first=Elaine | title=Otto and Vivika Heino | journal=Ceramics Monthly | volume=25 |date=October 1977 | pages=38–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They later returned to California, crossing the country in three moving vans, carrying 29 tons of materials. They purchased a house in [[Ojai, California|Ojai]], a small community in the mountains northwest of Los Angeles, built by [[Beatrice Wood]], a friend since 1952. Their pottery studio, ''The Pottery'', produced functional and decorative vessels, as well as architectural commissions.

The Heinos supported themselves as potters throughout their career. Clean lines and distinctive glazes mark their work; avoiding ceramic trends, they focused on traditional and utilitarian pottery. Glazes, however, are Heino's greatest legacy. The yellow glaze being their most famous one.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/local/la-hm-heino26-2008jun26-story.html {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151214194432/http://www.latimes.com/local/la-hm-heino26-2008jun26-story.html |date=2015-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were part of a generation that sought to redefine the relationship between ceramics and modern art.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Rostron studied at Blackburn College of Art on the Foundation course in 1990 together with Patrick Bridge, Andrew Hine, Lisa Roberts amongst others. Then Rostron enrolled in an Art school in Sheffield before they moved to Berlin in 2002. In 2004, they launched their label Rostron Records with Planningtorock's EP ''Eins'', following it in 2005 with a compilation LP '' Carousel of Souls'' that featured songs from [[The Knife]] and [[The Soft Pink Truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin Piers|title=Girlie Action|url=http://girlieaction.com/client.php?id=184|website=Girlieaction.com|accessdate=19 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002095514/http://www.girlieaction.com/client.php?id=184|archivedate=2 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sang backing vocals on the [[Badly Drawn Boy]] track 'Outside is a Light 2', a B-Side from the 1999 single 'It Came From the Ground'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Badly-Drawn-Boy-It-Came-From-The-Ground/release/52465|title=Badly Drawn Boy - It Came From The Ground|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After signing to [[Chicks on Speed]]'s record label in 2006, Planningtorock released the limited edition 7" single "Changes/I Wanna Bite Ya," before their debut album was released the following summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHICKS ON SPeeD RECORDS|url=http://chicksonspeed-records.com/site2/display/index.php?what=artist&amp;artist_id=15|accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Planningtorock remixed the song "[[Marble House (song)|Marble House]]" by [[The Knife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Knife, The – Marble House (Vinyl) at Discogs|url=http://www.discogs.com/Knife-Marble-House/release/709625|website=[[Discogs.com]]|accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010–2011: ''Tomorrow, In a Year'' and ''W''===
In 2010, Planningtorock collaborated with [[The Knife]] and [[Mount Sims]] to write an opera for the Danish performance group Hotel Pro Forma. The opera, titled ''[[Tomorrow, In a Year]]'', is based on [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. ''Tomorrow, In a Year'' was later released on 9 March 2010, by [[Mute Records]] and received generally favourable reviews from contemporary critics; according to the music review aggregation of [[Metacritic]], it garnered an average score of 67/100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tomorrow, In a Year Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/tomorrow-in-a-year|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rostron worked as the [[sound design]]er and componist for the [[Bruce LaBruce]] film ''The Bad Breast; or, The Strange Case of Theda Lange'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bad Breast; or, The Strange Case of Theda Lange (2010) – Full cast and crew|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1934415/fullcredits#cast|work=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rostron began correspondence with [[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]] after he sent them a fan email that said 'Really like the Planningtorock stuff – just saying." Murphy later invited them on [[LCD Soundsystem]]'s ''[[Sound of Silver]]'' tour before signing them to his label [[DFA Records]].Planningtorock co-wrote the song "Answering Machine" from the album ''[[From the Cradle to the Rave]]'' by DFA label-mate [[Shit Robot]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RA News: Shit Robot goes From The Cradle to the Rave|url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/news.aspx?id=12529|work=[[Resident Advisor]]|accessdate=19 September 2011|date=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; DFA released Rostron's second studio album ''[[W (Planningtorock album)|W]]'' on 17 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitzmaurice|first=Larry|title=New Release: Planningtorock: W|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/41769-new-release-planningtorock-iwi/|work=[[Pitchfork Media]]|accessdate=19 September 2011|date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rostron had been working on the album's songs since 2007, eventually writing more than 27 songs.&lt;ref name="dummy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mcfarlane|first=David|title=Planningtorock interview: "It's all I do. I love it."|url=http://www.dummymag.com/features/2011/05/23/planningtorock-interview/|website=Dummymag.com|accessdate=23 September 2011|date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''W'' received positive reviews from contemporary critics; according to the music review aggregation of [[Metacritic]], it garnered an average score of 72/100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=W Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/w|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album included a cover of [[Arthur Russell (musician)|Arthur Russell]]'s song "Janine."

===2012–2013: EPs and ''All Love's Legal''===

In an interview with [[Resident Advisor]], Rostron stated: 'Last summer after touring W, I had a bit of a creative meltdown and wasn't sure about making music any more—then I wrote "Patriarchy Over And Out," and suddenly the goal of the next album became clear'. During this period Rostron legally changed their name from Janine to Jam so as to have a non-gendered name. They also revealed that in the Spring of 2012 they set up a studio space with [[Olof Dreijer]] (of [[The Knife]]), Hermione Frank (AKA Roxymore) and Paula Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/news.aspx?id=21605|title=Planningtorock returns with All Love's Legal|website=Residentadvisor.net|accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rostron states that "Patriarchy Over And Out" was a turning point 'which was the beginning of being more direct and experimenting with being more political'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronicbeats.net/en/features/interviews/new-sounds-battling-the-fear-of-queer-planningtorock/|title=New Sounds Battling the Fear of Queer: Planningtorock – Telekom Electronic Beats|date=10 May 2013|website=Electronicbeats.net|accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 March 2013 Rostron released "Misogyny Drop Dead EP"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/PlanningToRock-Misxgyny-Drxp-Dead/release/4356373|title=PlanningToRock - Misxgyny Drxp Dead|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in mid-July released a vinyl-only remix of "Full of Fire" by [[The Knife]] "Let's Talk About Gender Baby".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Knife-Lets-Talk-About-Gender-Baby-Planningtorock-Full-Of-Fire-Remix/release/4780909|title=The Knife - Let's Talk About Gender Baby (Planningtorock Full Of Fire Remix)|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 October 2013 Rostron announced a third studio album ''All Love's Legal''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/PLANNINGTOROCK/posts/10151778963281997|title=PLANNINGTOROCK|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a music video for its opening track "Welcome".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCk22Bjf07I|title=Welcome - Planningtorock|date=29 October 2013|accessdate=23 November 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2018-present: ''Powerhouse'' ===
On 31 August 2018, Rostron released, "Transome", as the lead single from their fourth studio album, ''Powerhouse''. It was followed by a second album track, Much To Touch on 12 October 2018. Both were released via Human Level / [[DFA Records]]. 

Rostron identifies as [[genderqueer]] and non-binary. ''Powerhouse'' includes several tracks in which they sing about their family and childhood in Bolton, England. The title track is a tribute to Roston’s mother: ‘She’s basically the powerhouse of the record. It was the hardest track to write, to pin down and express my love and adoration for my mum, because there’s so many things that she’s done for me, for the family, for my sister. She’s the powerhouse, for sure.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/planningtorock-jam-rostron/|title=Meet the genderqueer pop star you didn’t realize you need in your life|date=2018-10-12|work=Gay Star News|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistry==
Planningtorock has stated that the distortion of their vocals allows for the "playing around with gender alongside communicating what I feel is the emotions within the songs. Because I am really interested in expanding upon the limits that we live in – how we are defined – and it is an experiment."&lt;ref name="dummy"/&gt;

'''Robert Augustus Toombs''' (July 2, 1810 &amp;ndash; December 15, 1885) was an American lawyer, slaveholder and politician who became one of the organizers of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] and its first [[Confederate States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. He served in Jefferson Davis' cabinet as well as in the [[Confederate States Army]], but later became one of Davis' critics, and only reluctantly returned to the United States after the Confederate defeat and regained political power as Congressional Reconstruction ended.

A lawyer by training, Toombs gained renown as speaker in the U.S. House of Representatives, and later in the U.S. Senate. A slaveholder, he found common ground with fellow-Georgian [[Alexander H. Stephens]] and advocated states' rights and extending slavery. Toombs supported the [[Compromise of 1850]], but later advocated secession. Toombs had always made a powerful impression on the public with his emotive oratory, backed by a strong physical presence, but his intemperate habits and volatile personality limited his career potential. In the newly formed Confederate Government, Toombs was appointed Secretary of State, but criticised the attack on Fort Sumter, which put him at odds with President [[Jefferson Davis]] (whose position he had coveted), and he quit to join the [[Confederate States Army]]. He became a Brigadier-General, and was wounded at the [[Battle of Antietam]]. In 1863, Toombs resigned his commission in the Confederate Army to join the Georgia militia. He was subsequently denied higher promotion and resigned, continuing to feud with Davis to the last. When the war ended, he fled to Cuba, later returning to Georgia. But he refused to request a pardon, thus sacrificing his political future.

==Early and family life==
Born near [[Washington, Georgia]] in 1810, Robert Augustus Toombs was the fifth child of Catherine Huling and Robert Toombs. He was of [[English American|English]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Toombs, statesman, speaker, soldier, sage: his career in Congress and ...  By Pleasant A.

Shortly after his admission to the Georgia bar, on November 18, 1830, Toombs married his childhood sweetheart, Martha Juliann ("Julia") DuBose (1813-1883), daughter of Ezekiel DuBose of Lincoln County, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.civilwarwomenblog.com/julia-dubose-toombs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toombs|first1=Robert|title=Letters to Martha Juliann DuBose Toombs, 1850-1867|url=http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/hargrett/toombs/|website=Digital Library of Georgia|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had three daughters: Louisa (b. 1833), Sarah (Sallie) (1835-1866) and (Julia b.1838).&lt;ref&gt;1950 U.S. Federal Census for Washington, Wilkes County Georgia family 677&lt;/ref&gt; The last survivor, Sallie Toombs DuBose married distant relative and lawyer [[Dudley M. DuBose]] and died shortly after the American Civil War as discussed below.

==Early legal and political career==
Toombs was admitted to Georgia bar and began his legal practice in 1830. He began his political career by being elected to the [[Georgia House of Representatives]], where he served in 1838 but failed to win re-election, was elected again and served 1840–41, and again failed to win re-election but was again elected and served 1843–44. His genial character, proclivity for entertainment, and unqualified success on the legal circuit earned Toombs the growing attention and admiration of his fellow Georgians.

Toombs won a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1844, and would win re-election several times, serving in the lower chamber until 1853, when he won higher office. Toombs joined his close friend and fellow representative [[Alexander H. Stephens]] from [[Crawfordville, Georgia]]. Their friendship became a powerful personal and political bond that effectively defined and articulated Georgia's position on national issues in the middle decades of the nineteenth century. Toombs, like Stephens, emerged as a states' rights partisan, became a national Whig, and once the [[United States Whig Party|Whig Party]] dissolved, aided in the creation of the short-lived [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] in the early 1850s.

As most Whigs, Toombs considered Texas as the 28th state. Historian [[William Y. Thompson]] writes that Toombs was "prepared to vote all necessary supplies to repel invasion. But he did not agree that the territory between the [[Nueces River]] and the [[Rio Grande]] was a part of Texas. He declared the movement of American forces to the Rio Grande at [[James K. Polk|President Polk]]'s command "was contrary to the laws of this country, a usurpation on the rights of this House, and an aggression on the rights of Mexico."&lt;ref&gt;[[William Y. Thompson]], ''Robert Toombs of Georgia'' ([[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University]] Press, 1966, Library of Congress No. 66-25722, p. 38)&lt;/ref&gt;
==Slaveholdings==

Toombs and his brother Gabriel owned large plantations and operated them using slavelabor. Toombs also increased his personal slave holdings as his wealth increased. Toombs owned 6 slaves in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite census | url = | title = 1840 United States Census| year = 1840| location = District 164, Wilkes, Georgia| roll = | page = | line = | enumdist = | filmnum = | nafilm = | accessdate = 22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1850, he owned 17 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite census | url = | title = 1850 United States Census, Slave Schedule| year = 1850| location = Subdivision 94, Wilkes, Georgia| roll = | page = | line = | enumdist = | filmnum = | nafilm = | accessdate = 21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, he owned 16 slaves at his Wilkes County plantation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite census | url = | title = 1860 United States Census, Slave Schedule| year = 1860| location = Wilkes, Georgia| roll = | page = 85| line = | enumdist = | filmnum = | nafilm = | accessdate = 22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an additional 32 slaves at his 3,800 acre plantation in [[Stewart County, Georgia]] on the [[Chattahoochee River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite census | url = | title = 1860 United States Census, Slave Schedule| year = 1860| location = District 22, Stewart, Georgia| roll = | page = 8-9| line = | enumdist = | filmnum = | nafilm = | accessdate = 21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1860, Toombs and his wife lived without any other family members in Wilkes County; in the census that year, Toombs owned $200,000 in real estate and personal property including slaves totaling $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;1860 U.S. Federal Census for Wilkes County, Georgia, family 547&lt;/ref&gt; One of his slaves, [[Garland H. White]], escaped just before the civil war and became a soldier and chaplain in the Union Army in 1862. Other slaves were freed by the Union Army. [[William Gaines (minister and community leader)]] and [[Wesley John Gaines]] (1840-1912) became church leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-reporter.com/news/2017-09-21/Front_Page/Jackson_Chapel_to_celebrate_150_years_in_special_s.html|title=Jackson Chapel to celebrate 150 years in special service with Bishop Jackson - www.news-reporter.com - News-Reporter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==From Unionist to Confederate==
Throughout the 1840s and 1850s, Toombs fought to reconcile national policies with his personal and sectional interests. He had opposed the [[Annexation of Texas]] but vowed to defend the new state once it was annexed late in 1845. He also opposed the [[Mexican–American War]], [[James K. Polk|President Polk]]'s [[Oregon]] policy, the [[Walker Tariff]] of 1846 and the [[Wilmot Proviso]], first introduced in 1846. In common with [[Alexander H. Stephens]] and [[Howell Cobb]], he defended [[Henry Clay]]'s [[Compromise of 1850]] against southerners who advocated [[secession]] from the Union as the only solution to sectional tensions over slavery. He denounced the [[Nashville Convention]], opposed the secessionists in Georgia, and helped to frame the famous [[Georgia platform]] (1850). His position and that of Southern Unionists during the decade 1850–1860 has often been misunderstood. They disapproved of secession, not because they considered it wrong in principle, but because they considered it inexpedient.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Toombs objected to halting the spread of slavery into the territories of California and [[New Mexico]] and even the abolition of what [[John C. Calhoun]] had called the "[[peculiar institution]]" in Washington, D.C. He took the view that the territories were the common property of all the people of the United States and that Congress must ensure equal treatment of both slaveholder and non-slaveholder. If the rights of the South were violated, Toombs declared, "Let discord reign forever."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p 58&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1853–61 Toombs served in the [[United States Senate]], only reluctantly joining the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] when lack of interest among other states doomed the Constitutional Union Party.

Toombs favored the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] of 1854, the admission of [[Kansas]] under the [[Lecompton Constitution]], and the [[English Bill (1858)]]. However, his faith in the resiliency and effectiveness of the national government to resolve sectional conflicts waned as the 1850s drew to a close.

On June 24, 1856, Toombs introduced the Toombs Bill, which proposed a constitutional convention in Kansas under conditions which were acknowledged by various anti-slavery leaders as fair, and which mark the greatest concessions made by the pro-slavery senators during the Kansas struggle. The bill did not provide for the submission of the constitution to popular vote, and the silence on this point of the territorial law under which the Lecompton Constitution of Kansas was framed in 1857 was the crux of the Lecompton struggle.
Thompson refers to Toombs as "hardly a man of the people with his wealth and imperious manner. But his handsome imposing appearance, undoubted ability, and boldness of speech appealed to Georgians, who kept him in national office until the Civil War brought him home."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacob S. Clawson, he was "a bullish politician whose blend of acerbic wit, fiery demeanor, and political tact aroused the full spectrum of emotions from his constituents and colleagues....[he] could not balance his volatile personality with his otherwise keen political skill."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob S. Clawson, "A Georgia Firebrand in the Midst of the Sectional Crisis" (H-CivWar March 2012) [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=34777 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secession ==
[[File:ConfederateCabinet.jpg|thumb|The original [[Confederate States of America#Executive|Confederate Cabinet]]. L-R: [[Judah P. Benjamin]], [[Stephen Mallory]], [[Christopher Memminger]], [[Alexander Stephens]], [[LeRoy Pope Walker]], [[Jefferson Davis]], [[John Henninger Reagan|John H. Reagan]] and Robert Toombs.]]
In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|presidential campaign of 1860]] he supported [[John C. Breckinridge]], and on December 22, soon after the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], sent a telegram to Georgia that asserted that "secession by 4 March next should be thundered forth from the ballot-box by the united voice of Georgia." He delivered a farewell address in the Senate (January 7, 1861) in which he said: "We want no negro equality, no negro citizenship; we want no negro race to degrade our own; and as one man [we] would meet you upon the border with the sword in one hand and the torch in the other."&lt;ref&gt;http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/the-south-rises-again-and-again-and-again/#more-78437&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Georgia, and with Governor [[Joseph E. Brown]] led the fight for secession against Stephens and [[Herschel V. Johnson]] (1812–80). His influence was a most powerful factor in inducing the "old-line Whigs" to support immediate secession.

[[File:Robert Toombs House, (Wilkes County, Georgia).jpg|thumb|left|Toombs' house in [[Washington, Georgia]], 1934.]]
Unlike the crises of 1850, these events galvanized Toombs and energized ambitions for becoming the president of the new [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] nation.

==Confederacy==
The selection of [[Jefferson Davis]] as the new nation's chief executive dashed any hopes Toombs had imagined of holding the high office of the fledgeling Confederacy. Confederate leaders rejected Toombs because of his serious drinking problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=F. N. Boney|title=Rebel Georgia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBjVHP1AhgsC&amp;pg=PA19|year=1997|publisher=Mercer University Press|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had no diplomatic skills but Davis chose him as the [[Confederate States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Toombs was the only member of Davis' administration to voice reservations about the attack on Fort Sumter. After reading Lincoln's letter to the governor of South Carolina, Toombs said memorably: "Mr. President, at this time it is suicide, murder, and will lose us every friend at the North. You will wantonly strike a hornet's nest which extends from mountain to ocean, and legions now quiet will swarm out and sting us to death. It is unnecessary; it puts us in the wrong; it is fatal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Scroggins|title=Robert Toombs: The Civil Wars of a United States Senator and Confederate General|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RDJxLEYVH0UC&amp;pg=PA134|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Army general==
Within months of his cabinet appointment, a frustrated Toombs stepped down to join the [[Confederate States Army]]. He received a commission as a [[History of Confederate States Army Generals#Brigadier general|brigadier general]] on July 19, 1861, and served first as a brigade commander in the (Confederate) [[Army of the Potomac (Confederate)|Army of the Potomac]], and then in [[David Rumph Jones|David R. Jones]]' [[division (military)|division]] of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] through the [[Peninsula Campaign]], [[Seven Days Battles]], [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], and [[Maryland Campaign]]. He was wounded in the hand at the [[Battle of Antietam]] where he commanded the heroic defense of [[Burnside's Bridge]].

Toombs resigned his CSA commission on March 3, 1863, to become [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] of the 3rd Cavalry of the Georgia [[Militia]], and subsequently served as a brigadier general and adjutant and inspector-general of General [[Gustavus Woodson Smith|Gustavus W. Smith]]'s division of Georgia militia. He then launched a major attack on Davis and the government, opposed conscription and the suspension of habeas corpus, as newspapers warned that he verged on treason. In the [[Battle of Columbus (1865)|last battle of the Civil War at Columbus, Georgia]], Toombs commanded the defense of the upper bridge. When the war ended, he fled to Cuba, and then Paris, along with [[P.G.T. Beauregard]] and Julia Colquitt, wife of another Confederate general.&lt;ref&gt;Chesson 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
==Final years==
His beloved wife returned to Georgia in late 1866 following the death of their last surviving child, Sallie Toombs DuBose, in Washington County, Georgia, leaving her husband to care for several small children. Toombs missed his wife and returned to Georgia in 1867 but refused to request a pardon from the president and therefore regained neither his right to vote nor hold political office.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.civilwarwomenblog.com/julia-dubose-toombs/&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did restore his lucrative law practice, in connection with his son-in-law [[Dudley M. DuBose]], who was elected a U.S. Representative and served one term. In addition, Toombs funded and dominated the Georgia constitutional convention of 1877,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garrison|first1=Ellen|title=Reactionaries or Reformers? Membership and Leadership of the Georgia Constitutional Convention of 1877|journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly|date=Winter 2006|volume=90|issue=4|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=23695961&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where once again he demonstrated the political skill and temperament that earlier had earned him a reputation as one of Georgia's most effective leaders. He gained a populist reputation for his attacks on railroads.

==Death and legacy==

1883 proved a privotal and negative year for Toombs, causing him to sink into depression, alcoholism, and ultimately blindness.&lt;ref&gt;Chesson, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; As March began, his son-in-law Dudley M. Dubose suffered a stroke and died. His long-time political ally, former Confederate Vice-President turned Georgia Governor, [[Alexander H. Stephens]], also died. By September, his beloved wife Julia died. Toombs died December 15, 1885, and was buried at Resthaven cemetery in Wilkes County, Georgia beside his daughter and son-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9092&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Georgia Department of Natural Resources]] owns and operates the [[Robert Toombs House]] in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonwilkes.org Washington-Wilkes County]&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia also erected a historical marker in [[Clarkesville, Georgia|Clarkesville]], [[Habersham County, Georgia]] concerning the Toombs-Bleckly House, which Toombs acquired as a summer residence in 1879 and sold to Georgia Supreme Court justice [[Logan E. Bleckley]] five years later, although it burned down in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;https://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/habersham/toombs-bleckley-house&lt;/ref&gt; His great-great-grandson, Roderick George Toombs, became better known as professional wrestler [[Roddy Piper]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://podcastone.com/Pipers-Pit-with-Roddy-Piper ''Piper's Pit'' on PodcastOne, Episode 28, "Andre the Giant and Ghost Stories" (32:30)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surendra Kumar Dey''', [[Indian Civil Service|ICS]], (1905-1989) was India’s first Union Cabinet minister for Cooperation and Panchyati Raj. Mr. Dey is remembered as the man who pioneered and steered community development in independent India. He firmly believed that democracy cannot be practiced by government servants and stressed that the fruits of democracy ought to reach every village.

==Early life==
S. K. Dey was born on 13 September 1905 in Laxmibassa village in Sylhet district in present-day Bangladesh, Mr. Dey went on to study engineering at world-renowned institutions- [[Purdue University]] and Michigan in the United States of America. Dey was a son-in-law of the eminent nationalist leader, [[Bipin Chandra Pal]].

==Career==
He began his career by serving as the Honorary Technical Advisor to the Ministry of Rehabilitation, [[Government of India]] (1948–51). It was in this post that Dey proved his mettle as a “social engineer” and was noticed by top government, including then-Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.

===Tenure as Minister===
Dey’s vitality and commitment to developing grassroots democracy prompted Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] to hand over the reins of Rural Development in newly independent India to Mr. Dey.

After Nehru’s death, Dey resigned from the ministry and dedicated his time to build Panchayati Raj institutions in the country. As minister, his pet project was the Community Development Programme (1953) which would later form the basis of Community Development Blocks across the country. Mr. Dey’s concept of community development was rooted in his belief that the community could help itself rather than looking “towards the government as Mai-Baap.” Mr. Dey’s model of community development is characterized by a three-pronged strategy- development of the area, coordinated
administration and development of the individual and the community.

The first Community Development Project was undertaken in Etawah U.P in 1948. During 1952, 55 such projects were taken up across the country. Taking their success into account, the Community Development Programme was scaled up to all blocks in the country.

===Rural Township===
In 1949, Dey designed the concept of an agro-industrial township for rural development. The thrust of this model was its focus on a combination of agriculture and industrial development. The township would be provided support in terms of goods and services by surrounding villages. It would be self-sufficient and function on the basis of cooperation.

This model materialized as the “Mazdoori Manzil” project in 1950, in [[Nilokheri]], [[Haryana]]. The project benefitted 7000 homeless refugees from Pakistan. Mr. Dey considered this model to be welfare state in action.

Impressed with the model, Nehru termed it to be the “Mecca of Development” and called for the creation of many more Nilokher is across the country. Unfortunately, over the years, Nilokheri has been lost to obscurity and lacks evenbasic facilities such as health, water and education.

S.K. Dey appears to have been influenced, on the one hand, by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]’s Shantiniketan experiment for Rural Development and, on the other, by the Gandhian idea of Rural Construction, which laid stress on self-sufficiency and manual labour. It could also be perceived as a Model of Rural Development based on a synthesis of Liberalism, Marxism and Gandhi-ism. The emphasis on individual liberty seems to have been imbibed from Liberalism, stress on right and duty to work from Marxism and that of small scale cottage and village industries from Gandhi-ism.

===Panchayati Raj===
Dey was a member of the Balwantrai Mehta Committee (1957) that was set up to study the Community
Development Programme. The Committee assessed the extent to which the programme had succeeded in utilizing local initiatives and in creating institutions to ensure continuity in the process of improving economic and social conditions in rural areas. The Committee held that community development would be deep and enduring only when the community was involved in the planning, decision -making and implementation process, thus making a case for a strong Panchayati Raj system. The Balwantrai Mehta Committee proposed a seminal developmental role for Panchayati Raj Institution in rural development and termed these as necessary for the success of community development and national extension programmes.

Dey attributed philosophical connotations to the Panchayati Raj, which he explained in detail in his book “Panchayat-i-Raj, a Synthesis.” He elucidates that the Panchayati Raj was an important link between the individual and the world at large. Dey visualized an intimate relationship
between the Gram Sabha and the Lok Sabha and said that democracy was to flow from the Parliament to the Gram Sabha. Dey urged state governments to give priority to establishing PRIs their respective states. By the 1960s, all states had legislated on PRIs and more 2, 17, 300 Panchayats had come into being.

===Other Achievements===
Mr. Dey also played an instrumental role in the institution of the National Development Council. Mr. Dey’s has made a
marked contribution to the field of development journalism by being the guiding force behind “[[Kurukshetra]]”, the
monthly organ of the Ministry of Rural Development. Mr. Dey was a rare blend of a philosopher and practitioner who
played an important role in the nation-building process for more than four decades after Independence. His
pioneering contribution to the concept and implementation of rural development and Panchayati Raj merits special
attention from social scientists, administrators, political leaders and other stakeholders in the project for rural
development and decentralized rural governance

[[File:Nordenfelt submarine Abdülhamid.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Nordenfelt class Ottoman submarine Abdülhamid (1886) was the first submarine in history to fire a torpedo whilst submerged. Two submarines of this class, ''Nordenfelt II'' (''Abdülhamid'', 1886) and ''Nordenfelt III'' (''Abdülmecid'', 1887) joined the Ottoman fleet. They were built in pieces by Des Vignes (Chertsey) and Vickers (Sheffield) in England, and assembled at the Taşkızak Naval Shipyard in Istanbul, Turkey.]]

'''Thorsten Nordenfelt''' (1 May 1842 – 18 August 1920), was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] inventor and industrialist.

Nordenfelt was born in Örby outside [[Kinna]], Sweden, the son of a colonel. The surname was and is often spelt Nordenfeldt, though Thorsten and his brothers always spelt it Nordenfelt, and the 1881 Census shows it as Nordenfelt. The family home in that year was Leinster Lodge on the Uxbridge Road, [[Paddington]] in west London.

Thorsten worked for a Swedish company in London from 1862 to 1866 and migrated to England in 1867 when he married Emma Stansfeld Grundy.

Thorsten Nordenfelt and his brother-in-law started a small business to trade Swedish steel for British rails in 1887. Later on he founded ''Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company, ltd'' to develop a machine-gun designed by [[Helge Palmcrantz]] that would be referred to as the [[Nordenfelt gun]]. His company also designed a range of anti-torpedoboat guns in calibres from 37 to 57&amp;nbsp;mm, that were produced in [[Erith]], Kent, Stockholm and Spain. Under pressure from [[Rothschild banking family of England|Rothschild]] and [[Vickers]] his company merged with [[Hiram Maxim|Maxim]]'s in 1888 to form The [[Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company]].

After a [[personal bankruptcy]] Nordenfelt was forced out of the Nordenfelt-Maxim company in 1890 and left England for France, where his new company, Société Nordenfelt, designed the eccentric screw breech used on the [[Canon de 75 modèle 1897|French 75]]. Legal action followed (''[[Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co Ltd]]'') over a non-compete clause Nordenfelt had signed.

In 1903 he returned to Sweden and retired.

In 1902 a public house named after Thorsten Nordenfelt was built at 181 Erith Road, Erith just along from the Gun and Carriage works of [[Vickers|Vickers, Sons and Maxim]] (previously [[Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company]]) . Named 'The Nordenfelt Tavern' it was built to the design of Jonathan G. Ensor (1852/3-19??), architect for brewer [[Watney Combe &amp; Reid]]&lt;ref&gt;James Packer 'Bexley Pubs' {{ISBN|0902541331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Submarines==

Discussions between Thorsten Nordenfelt and the English reverend [[George Garrett (inventor)|George Garrett]] led to the production of a series of steam powered [[submarines]]. The first was the ''Nordenfelt I'', a 56 tonne, 19.5 metre long vessel similar to Garret's ill-fated ''[[Resurgam]]'' (1879), with a range of 240 kilometres and armed with a single torpedo and a 25.4&amp;nbsp;mm machine gun. It was manufactured by [[Bolinders]] in Stockholm in 1884-1885. Like the ''Resurgam'', it operated on the surface using a 100 HP steam engine with a maximum speed of 9 kn, then it shut down its engine to dive. She was purchased by the Greek Government and was delivered to [[Salamis Naval Base]] in 1886. Following the acceptance tests, she was never used again by the [[Hellenic Navy]] and was scrapped in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Vice Admiral C. Paizis-Paradellis, HN | title=Hellenic Warships 1829-2001 (3rd Edition) | location=Athens, Greece | publisher=The Society for the study of Greek History | year=2002 | isbn=960-8172-14-4|page=133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nordenfelt then built the ''Nordenfelt II'' (''[[Ottoman submarine Abdül Hamid|Abdül Hamid]]'') in 1886 and ''Nordenfelt III'' (''Abdül Mecid'') in 1887, a pair of 30 metre long submarines with twin torpedo tubes, for the [[Ottoman Navy]]. ''Abdül Mamid'' became the first submarine in history to fire a torpedo while submerged under water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.submarineheritage.com/history.html Submarine Heritage Centre - submarine history of Barrow-in-Furness&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Nordenfelt's efforts culminated in 1887 with the ''Nordenfelt IV'' which had twin motors and twin torpedoes. It was sold to the Russians, but proved unstable and ran aground off Jutland; when the Russians refused to pay for it, it was scrapped.

''Abdülhamid'' and ''Abdülmecid'' were in [[Istanbul]] in 1914. The submarines were briefly considered for use in harbour defence but it was found that their hulls were too badly corroded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Royal Navy Submarine Service A Centennial History |last=Preston |first=Antony |authorlink= Antony Preston (naval historian) |year=2001 |publisher=Conway Maritime Press |isbn=0-85177-891-7 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wahnenauhi''' (born '''Lucy Lowrey Hoyt Keys'''; c. 1831 - 1912&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/22138/bae_bulletin_196_1966_77_175-214.pdf|title=Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 196: Anthropological Papers No. 77; The Wahnenauhi Manuscript: Historical Sketches of the Cherokees Together with Some of Their Customs, Traditions, and Superstitions|last=Keys|first=Lucy|editor-last=Kilpatrick|editor-first=Jack|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Cherokee woman whose writings on the history and culture of Cherokee Indian people were published by the Bureau of American Ethnology in 1889. Her collection of writings, entitled ''Historical Sketches of the Cherokees, Together with Some of their Customs, Traditions, and Superstitions'', features historical accounts, legends, traditional practices, and stories that highlight aspects of Cherokee culture. Whanenauhi wrote the manuscript at a time when Cherokee acculturation into white society was heavily encouraged by her peers, and her work is often considered a backlash against that attitude.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nativehistoryassociation.org/chiltoskey.php|title=NATIVE HISTORY ASSOCIATION - Mary Ulmer Chiltoskey and Wahnenauhi|website=www.nativehistoryassociation.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Wahnenauhi was born in 1831 in Willstown, Alabama to Dr. Milo Hoyt, and Lydia Lowrey, a Cherokee woman. As a member of a Cherokee family with an elite social status, Wahnenauhi was well educated, and became one of the first students to ever graduate from the Cherokee Female Seminary in February 1855.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Wahnenauhi came from a prominent family with mixed Amerindian heritage, and was related by marriage to Principle Chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]]. Her upbringing demanded that she both conform to the ideals of assimilation and maintain an intellectual connection to the traditions of her Indigenous heritage.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smithers|first=Gregory D.|date=2017|title=Diasporic Women: Wahnenauhi, Narcissa Owen, and the Shifting Frontiers of Cherokee Identity.|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/653266|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=38|pages=197–224|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; This personal conflict had a major influence on her writings later in life, and Wahnenauhi joined other female indigenous activists like [[Narcissa Chisholm Owen|Nacissa Chisholm Owen]] and [[Sarah Winnemucca]] to reclaim traditional Indian practices through education and literature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Writings ==
Wahnenauhi's manuscript entitled ''Historical Sketches of the Cherokees, Together with Some of their Customs, Traditions, and Superstitions'' is a sociological outline of many traditional Cherokee practices, teachings, stories, and histories. In September 1889, at the age of 58, Wahnenauhi sent her collection of writings to the Bureau of Ethnology (known today as the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]]) with a note offering her 70 page manuscript for editing and publication. In November 1889, the Bureau of Ethnology bought the rights to Wahnenauhi's manuscript for $10.00, and published her ethnographic record of the Cherokee people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
Wahnenauhi's work is considered a significant contribution to the American Indian traditionalist reform movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Her manuscript is contemporary with many other writers in the traditionalist reform movement, and takes on a preservationist philosophy through the re-telling of many of the old ways of the Cherokee peoples.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eqfhtZ0-NkIC&amp;pg=PR45&amp;dq=Wahnenauhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3nJ-ex_PXAhVK4WMKHV7qBeY4FBDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Wahnenauhi&amp;f=false|title=The Singing Bird: A Cherokee Novel|last=Oskison|first=John Milton|date=2007|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=|isbn=9780806138183|location=|pages=xlv|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11194">[[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] (1746–1817), a prominent figure in the history of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and the [[American Revolution]], made several wills, notably one in 1798 stipulating that the proceeds of his American estate be spent on freeing and educating African-American slaves, including those of his friend [[Thomas Jefferson]], whom he named as the will's [[executor]]. Jefferson refused the executorship and the will was beset by legal complications, including the discovery of later wills. Jefferson's refusal incited discussion in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.  Kościuszko returned to Europe in 1798 and lived there until his 1817 death in Switzerland. In the 1850s, what was left of the money in Kościuszko's U.S. trust was turned over by the U.S. Supreme Court to his heirs in Europe.

==History==
In 1798 Kościuszko decided to leave the [[United States]] and return to the Russian-controlled sector of [[Poland]]. His friend [[Thomas Jefferson]] provided him with a passport in a false name and arranged for his secret departure to France.&lt;ref name=Gardner124&gt;[[#Gardner|Gardner, 1943]], p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sulkin, 1944, p. 48"&gt;[[#Sulkin|Sulkin, 1944]], p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Before leaving that same year (1798) he wrote out a will, which he entrusted to Jefferson as executor.  In the document, Kościuszko, over six decades before the [[American Civil War]],  pleaded for the emancipation of America's Negro [[slaves]].&lt;ref name=Gardner124/&gt;

Kościuszko left his American estate to buy the freedom of black [[slaves]], including Jefferson's own, and to educate them for independent life and work.&lt;ref name="Sulkin, 1944, p. 48"/&gt; In September 1817, shortly before his death in October, he wrote a letter to Jefferson mentioning the bequest - "...of which money, after my death, you know the fixed destination."&lt;ref name=testamentary/&gt; Several years after Kościuszko's death, Jefferson, aged 77, pleaded his inability to execute the will due to age&lt;ref name=Stotozynski&gt;[[#Storozynski2009|Storozynski, 2009]], p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; and the numerous legal complexities of the bequest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nash2012|Nash, Hodges, Russell, 2011]], p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson recommended his friend [[John Hartwell Cocke]], who also opposed slavery, to be executor, but Cocke also declined to execute the bequest.&lt;ref name=Stotozynski/&gt; He wrote to Jefferson that there were "prejudices to be encountered" in their education and of "an effect which might be produced on the minds of my own people."&lt;ref name=Stotozynski/&gt; The federal court appointed an attorney, Benjamin L. Lear, to be executor of the estate. Lear died in 1832, the case still unresolved, and so his executor, Colonel [[George Bomford]], became the executor as well of the Kościuszko estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Storozynski|first1=Alex|title=The Peasant Prince: Thaddeus Kosciuszko and the age of revolution|date=2009|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books, St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-38802-7|pages=282–284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kościuszko had made a total of four wills, three of which postdated the American one.&lt;ref name=berk&gt;[[#Yiannopoulos|Yiannopoulos, 1958]], p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; Within months after his death in October 1817, two other claims were made on his American estate; one by [[Kosciusko Armstrong]] and one by the Zeltner family, who had housed him immediately before his death. Both parties produced wills written by Kościuszko.&lt;ref name=testamentary/&gt; A representative of the Russian government also made inquiries.&lt;ref name=testamentary/&gt; The case of Kościuszko's American estate went three times to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].{{#tag:ref|Associate Justice [[Joseph Story]] issued a decision to remand in ''Armstrong v. Lear,'' 25 U.S. 12 Wheat. 169 169 (1827), based on failure to submit the will for probate. The same estate was also the subject of ''Estho v Lear,'' 32 U.S. 130 (7 Pet. 130, 8 L.Ed. 632)(1832), in which Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] wrote a brief opinion suggesting remand, apparently to Virginia. Finally, the decision in ''Ennis v. Smith'', 55 U.S. 14 How. 400 400 (1852) mentions no individual author; the chief justice was then [[Roger Taney]], and the only jurisdictions mentioned were those of [[Maryland]], the [[District of Columbia]], and [[Grodno]] (now in [[Belarus]]).&lt;ref name="ennis"/&gt; |group="note"}} In 1852 the Supreme Court awarded the estate to Kościuszko's heirs in Poland.&lt;ref name="Nash"/&gt; Before the final Supreme Court decision, Gaspard Tochman, acting on behalf of Kosciusko's relatives, had found an 1816 will drawn up in Paris. This will, which revoked the one made in concert with Jefferson and the one concerning Kosciusko Armstrong, was authenticated. In light of the discovery, the Court ruled that the earlier wills treating his American assets were invalid and that these assets should be turned over to his closest living relatives.&lt;ref name=testamentary/&gt;

During the legal proceedings between his death and the Supreme Court's decision, the value of his estate decreased substantially; this was attributed by a case attorney to Colonel Bomford's use of the estate for his own purposes.&lt;ref name=Storozynski-282/&gt; In its 1852 ruling, the Supreme Court stated that the June 1847 value of his US estate was $43,504.40 and that only $5,680 could be found.&lt;ref name=testamentary/&gt;

None of the resources that Kościuszko had earmarked for the [[manumission]] and education of [[African-Americans]] were ever used for that purpose.&lt;ref name=Storozynski-282/&gt;

==Interpretations==
The abolitionist [[William Lloyd Garrison]] later criticized Jefferson's inaction, as have Jefferson historians since the late 20th century, including [[Merrill Peterson]], [[Gary Nash]] and [[Edmund S. Morgan]].&lt;ref name="Morgan"/&gt; In his biography of Jefferson, [[Merrill Peterson|Peterson]] wrote,&lt;blockquote&gt;The object of [Kosciuszko’s] will was lost. Had Jefferson felt stronger about the object, he would have ventured the experiment, despite statutory obstacles and the shortness of years, for the experiment [of freeing his slaves] was one he often commended to others and, indeed, one he may have himself suggested to Kosciuszko.&lt;ref name="Nash"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The subject was revisited in the early 21st century. Historian [[Henry Wiencek]] strongly criticized Jefferson's refusal of the executorship.&lt;ref name=reed&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2012/10/henry_wiencek_s_the_master_of_the_mountain_thomas_jefferson_biography_debunked.2.html|title=Thomas Jefferson Was Not a Monster - Debunking a major new biography of our third president|date=2012-10-12|accessdate=2013-10-05|publisher=[[Slate.com]]|author=[[Annette Gordon-Reed]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Annette Gordon-Reed]] countered that "Kosciusko screwed up," that the will was "a litigation disaster waiting to happen", since Jefferson had learned there were later wills, and that Jefferson risked financial exposure. In a 2009 biography of Jefferson, [[Christopher Hitchens]] wrote that he "...coldly declined to execute his friend's dying wish."&lt;ref name="Hitchens2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Hitchens|title=Thomas Jefferson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=piGlW1OyEmAC&amp;pg=PA185|date=13 October 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-175397-8|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yusuf al-'Azma''' ({{lang-ar|يوسف العظمة}}, [[ALA-LC]]: ''Yūsuf al-ʿAẓma''; 1883 – 24 July 1920) was the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria|Syria]]n minister of war in the governments of prime ministers [[Rida al-Rikabi]] and [[Hashim al-Atassi]], and the Arab Army's chief of general staff under King [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]]. He served as minister of war from January 1920 until his death while commanding Syrian forces against the French invasion during the [[Battle of Maysalun]].

Al-'Azma hailed from a wealthy [[Damascus|Damascene]] landowning family. He became an officer in the [[Ottoman Army]] and fought in multiple fronts in World War I. After the defeated Ottomans withdrew from Damascus, al-‘Azma served Emir [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]], the leader of the [[Arab Revolt]] and was appointed minister of war upon the establishment of the Arab government in Damascus in January 1920. With little resources and support, he was tasked with building the nascent Arab Army of Syria. The country, meanwhile, had been designated as a [[French Mandate of Syria|mandatory territory of France]], which did not recognize Faisal's government. Al-'Azma was among the more vociferous opponents of French rule and as their troops advanced toward Damascus from Lebanon, al-'Azma was authorized to confront them. Leading a motley army of civilian volunteers, ex-Ottoman officers and Bedouin cavalrymen, al-'Azma engaged the French at [[Maysalun|Maysalun Pass]] but he was killed in action, his soldiers were dispersed and the French occupied Damascus on 25 July 1920. Though his army was defeated, al-'Azma became a national hero in [[Syria]] for his insistence on confronting the French despite their clear military superiority and his ultimate death in the ensuing battle.

==Early life and family==
Al-'Azma was born to a prominent mercantile and landowning [[Damascus|Damascene]] family of [[Syrian Turkmens|Turkmen]] descent in 1883.&lt;ref name="Moubayed44"&gt;Moubayed 2006, p.

==Military career with the Ottomans==
[[File:Yousef aladma5.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of al-Azma in uniform after his graduation from the [[Turkish Military Academy|Ottoman Military Academy]] in 1906]]
Al-'Azma graduated from the Istanbul-based [[Turkish Military Academy|Ottoman Military Academy]] in 1906 and was a member of the underground reformist [[Committee of Union and Progress]].&lt;ref name="Provence213"&gt;Provence 2011, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, he underwent additional military training in Germany until returning to Istanbul in 1909.&lt;ref name="Provence213"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moubayed44"/&gt; There he enlisted in the [[Ottoman Modern Army|Ottoman Army]] and promptly was assigned as a military attaché to [[Cairo]], Egypt.&lt;ref name="Moubayed44"/&gt; In 1914, al-'Azma was Commander of the [[25th Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|25th Infantry Division]] during World War I.&lt;ref name="Moubayed44"/&gt; Later during the war, he was reassigned as a deputy of General [[Enver Pasha]] (Anwar Pasha) in Istanbul.&lt;ref name="Moubayed44"/&gt;

Toward the war's end, al-'Azma was appointed chief of staff of the Istanbul-based [[First Army (Ottoman Empire)|First Ottoman Army]] according to historian Phillip S. Khoury,&lt;ref name="Khoury97"&gt;Khoury 1987, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; or chief of staff of the Ottoman army in the [[Caucasus]] according to historian Ruth Roded.&lt;ref name="Roded90"/&gt; According to historian Michael Provence, it is "widely believed" that soon after this post, al-Azma joined the [[Arab Revolt]] against the Ottomans launched by [[Sharif Hussein]] of [[Mecca]] in 1916, "but he actually served as a decorated Ottoman frontline officer until October 1918".&lt;ref name="Provence213"/&gt; That month, Damascus was captured by the Arab Revolt's [[Triple Entente|British]]-backed [[Sharifian Army]] led by Hussein's son [[Faisal I of Iraq|Emir Faisal]].&lt;ref name="Moubayed44"/&gt; Al-'Azma subsequently returned to Damascus.&lt;ref name="Moubayed44"/&gt; He joined [[al-Fatat]], an [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] secret society founded in 1911,&lt;ref&gt;Tauber 2013, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvXZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 30] and p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvXZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211 211]&lt;/ref&gt; though it is not apparent when, and became a personal chamberlain of Emir Faisal.&lt;ref name="Moubayed44"/&gt; Unlike other ex-Ottoman officers from the empire's Arab lands who had hailed almost exclusively from modest upbringings, al-'Azma came from the upper urban class.&lt;ref name="Provence216"&gt;Provence 2011, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1919, Faisal appointed al-'Azma as Damascus' military attaché to [[Beirut]].&lt;ref name="Moubayed44"/&gt;

==Minister of War==
===Appointment===
[[File:Faisal and al-Azma.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Al-'Azma saluting King [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]] (center), 1920]]

In Prime Minister [[Rida al-Rikabi]]'s government, al-'Azma was promoted to minister of war and on 26 January 1920 was also appointed Chief of General Staff by Emir Faisal to replace [[Yasin al-Hashimi]] who had been arrested by British forces and detained in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;Tauber 2013, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvXZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24 24]&lt;/ref&gt; Al-'Azma's Damascene roots and reputation as a local and decorated Ottoman wartime general made him "an obvious choice for minister of war", according to Provence, despite having fought against the Arab Revolt months prior.&lt;ref name="Provence216"/&gt; During his time in office, al-'Azma established the foundations and hierarchy of the modern-day [[Syrian Army]], according to historian [[Sami Moubayed]].&lt;ref name="Moubayed44"/&gt; He gathered arms and ammunition left behind by the Ottoman Army in Syria, raised funds for new weaponry and by mid-1920, had created a military force of some 10,000 men, primarily consisting of [[Bedouin]] volunteers and former Ottoman officers.&lt;ref name="Moubayed44"/&gt;

===Opposition to the French Mandate===
Faisal declared the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]] in March 1920. However, in the secret 1916 [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]] between the United Kingdom and France, the two powers negotiated the division of the Ottomans' Arab territories between themselves and the [[League of Nations]] gave France a [[French Mandate of Syria|Mandate over Syria]] in April 1920. Afterward, two principal camps emerged in the Syrian government; the minority faction favored a compromise with France due to its military superiority over the Arab forces (especially since the British withdrew their backing for King Faisal), while the majority faction rejected French rule by all means. Al-Rikabi led the minority faction while the majority camp was led by al-'Azma and supported by other young former Ottoman officers.&lt;ref name="Allawi260"&gt;Allawi 2014, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tauber 2013, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvXZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 30]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Syrian government, including Foreign Minister [[Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar]], backed al-'Azma's faction.&lt;ref name="Allawi260"/&gt;

[[Image:yusufalazma.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Al-'Azma in military uniform as Syria's minister of war]]

French forces commanded by General [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|Henri Gouraud]] had landed in Beirut on 18 November 1919. Gouraud was determined to bring all of Syria under French control and demanded the immediate deployment of French forces to the [[Beqaa Valley]] between Beirut and Damascus.&lt;ref name="Allawi285"&gt;Allawi 2014, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; Against King Faisal's wishes, his delegate to General Gouraud, [[Nuri al-Said]], agreed to the French deployment.&lt;ref name="Allawi285"/&gt; However, when a French officer was assaulted by [[Shia Muslim]] rebels opposed to the French presence, Gouraud violated his agreement with al-Said and occupied the large town of [[Baalbek]].&lt;ref name="Allawi285"/&gt; The French deployment along the Syrian coast and the Beqaa Valley contributed to unrest throughout Syria and sharpened political divisions between al-'Azma's camp and those who sought compromise with the French.&lt;ref name="Allawi285"/&gt;

In northern Syria, an [[Alawite Revolt of 1919|Alawite revolt]] led by [[Saleh al-Ali]] and a [[Hananu Revolt|revolt in the Aleppo region]] led by [[Ibrahim Hananu]] were launched in response to the French presence. On 10 December 1919, Prime Minister al-Rikabi resigned amid pressure by the nationalists and popular opinion.&lt;ref name="Allawi285"/&gt; The revolts derived military support from [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]]'s insurgents in [[Anatolia]] and from Faisal's government.&lt;ref name="Provence216"/&gt; In June 1920, al-'Azma toured northern Syria to recruit more soldiers into the nascent Arab Army and establish connections with the Anatolian insurgency.&lt;ref name="Provence216"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khoury98"&gt;Khoury 1987, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-'Azma sensed resistance to his conscription campaign particularly in Aleppo, but managed to gather some troops.&lt;ref name="Khoury98"/&gt; French forces later occupied parts of northern Syria in early July 1920.&lt;ref name="Allawi285"/&gt;

On 13 July, al-'Azma declared emergency measures in the [[Syrian National Congress]], including press censorship, the power to seize civilian vehicles for military use and a call for militias across the country to support the army.&lt;ref name="Allawi287"&gt;Allawi 2014 p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Kemal's successes against the French in [[Turkey]], al-'Azma sought to follow in the latter's path in Syria. Meanwhile, Yasin al-Hashimi had returned to the country from Palestine and was tasked with inspecting al-'Azma's troops.&lt;ref name="Allawi287"/&gt; He concluded that the Arab Army was woefully unprepared and under-equipped for a serious confrontation against the [[Army of the Levant|French Army]].&lt;ref name="Allawi287"/&gt; In a meeting of King Faisal's war cabinet, al-'Azma was visibly upset with al-Hashimi's conclusions.&lt;ref name="Allawi287"/&gt; Regardless, he ultimately conceded that the army was in a precarious situation when informed that the lack of ammunition meant that each soldier would only be allotted 270 bullets for their rifle and each artillery piece could only be allotted eight shells.&lt;ref name="Allawi287"/&gt; Despite this, all of the officers in the meeting declared their willingness to fight.&lt;ref name="Allawi287"/&gt; According to Provence, both al-Azma and al-Hashimi "complained bitterly that they faced an impossible task in organizing defense, made all the more difficult by Faisal's refusal to seriously contemplate and prepare for military confrontation".&lt;ref name="Provence218"&gt;Provence 2011, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; In the struggle against France, both officers sought to implement the model of Kemal's Anatolian insurgency while Faisal continued, in vain, to seek an intervention by his erstwhile British allies.&lt;ref name="Provence218"/&gt;

On 14 July, France issued an ultimatum to the Syrian government to disband its army and submit to French control.&lt;ref name="Moubayed44"/&gt; On 18 July, King Faisal and the Syrian cabinet met and all ministers except for al-'Azma agreed not to enter into war with the French.&lt;ref name="Allawi288"&gt;Allawi 2014, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; After King Faisal ratified the cabinet's decision, al-'Azma withdrew his troops from [[Anjar, Lebanon|Anjar]], the hills overlooking the Beqaa Valley from the east, and the Beirut-Damascus road.&lt;ref name="Allawi288"/&gt; On 20 July, six hours prior to the ultimatum's deadline, King Faisal informed the French liaison in Damascus of his acceptance of Gouraud's terms.&lt;ref name="Tauber34"&gt;Tauber 2013, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvXZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34 34]&lt;/ref&gt; However, for unclear reasons, Faisal's notification did not reach Gouraud until 21 July.&lt;ref name="Tauber34"/&gt; Sources suspicious of French intentions accused them of intentionally delaying delivery of the notice to give Gouraud a legitimate excuse for advancing on Damascus.&lt;ref name="Tauber34"/&gt; However, there has been no evidence or indication of French sabotage.&lt;ref name="Tauber34"/&gt; When news of Faisal's submission to the French and his disbandment of Arab Army barracks in Damascus reached the populace, outrage ensued.&lt;ref name="Allawi288"/&gt; A riot by soldiers and residents angry at King Faisal's decision was violently put down by Emir [[Prince Zeid bin Hussein|Zeid]], resulting in some 200 deaths.&lt;ref name="Allawi289"&gt;Allawi 2014, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-'Azma rejected demands to disband the army and implored King Faisal for an opportunity to confront French forces.&lt;ref name="Moubayed45"&gt;Moubayed 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA45 45]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Maysalun and death===
{{main|Battle of Maysalun}}
[[File:Maysalun3.jpg|thumb|right|French General Henri Gouraud inspecting his troops at Maysalun]]

About 12,000 French troops consisting of ten infantry battalions as well as cavalrymen and artillerymen backed by tanks and fighter bombers, began their advance on Damascus on 21 July.&lt;ref name="Allawi289"/&gt; They first captured Anjar in the Beqaa Valley, where General Hassan al-Hindi's brigade had disbanded without a fight.&lt;ref&gt;Tauber 2013, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvXZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35 35]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allawi289"/&gt; The French advance surprised King Faisal who believed that French military action would be avoided by his agreement to the 14 July ultimatum as General Gouraud had promised.&lt;ref name="Allawi289"/&gt; In response to Gouraud's action, King Faisal agreed to al-'Azma's request for mobilization.&lt;ref name="Moubayed45"/&gt; About 300 of Hindi's disbanded troops from Anjar were ordered to re-mobilize at the [[Maysalun|Maysalun Pass]], some 12 miles to the west of Damascus. Al-'Azma managed to assemble a few hundred regular troops, and around 1,000 volunteers, including Bedouin cavalry.&lt;ref name="Allawi290"&gt;Allawi 2014, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July, King Faisal attempted to delay the French advance by dispatching Minister of Education [[Sati al-Husri]] to negotiate with General Gouraud, who laid out new conditions to prevent his army's offensive and gave King Faisal one more day to deliberate on the terms. The next day, while the cabinet considered Gouraud's conditions, the French requested entry into Maysalun to access its water. The Syrians interpreted the request to be an excuse for Gouraud's army to enter Damascus without a fight and King Faisal ultimately rejected Gouraud's request and his new conditions.&lt;ref name="Allawi290"/&gt; Afterward, al-'Azma departed Damascus to confront Gouraud's army in what became known as the [[Battle of Maysalun]].&lt;ref name="Moubayed45"/&gt;

Al-'Azma's troops in Maysalun were mostly equipped with rusted rifles left by Ottoman troops and rifles used by Bedouin irregulars during the 1916 Arab Revolt as well as 15 cannons.&lt;ref name="Tauber218"&gt;Tauber 2013, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvXZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA218 218]&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab force was composed of northern, central and southern columns with camel cavalry at the head.&lt;ref name="Tauber218"/&gt; Al-'Azma led the central column which was backed by numerous civilian volunteers.&lt;ref name="Tauber218"/&gt; Around dawn, at the approaches of Maysalun, clashes between Arab forces and the French Army took place, but most Arab resistance, which was largely uncoordinated, had collapsed by the first hour of battle.&lt;ref name="Tauber218"/&gt; The Syrians had used up the little ammunition they had and the militarily superior French Army broke the Arab lines.&lt;ref name="Moubayed45"/&gt;

Around 10:30am French forces reached al-'Azma's headquarters. The mines that had been laid by the Syrians did not explode or at  least did not seriously hinder the incoming French forces.&lt;ref name="Tauber218"/&gt; With French troops about 100 meters away from him, al-'Azma rushed to an artilleryman and commanded him to fire at the French tanks.&lt;ref name="Tauber218"/&gt; Before any shell was fired, al-'Azma was targeted by a tank crew and shot dead by French machine gun fire. He was hit in the chest and head.&lt;ref name="Tauber218"/&gt; Al-'Azma was the only Arab officer to die in the battle.&lt;ref name="Moubayed45"/&gt; Sporadic clashes continued for another three hours. By then, Arab forces had retreated in disarray towards Damascus.&lt;ref name="Tauber218"/&gt; The French Army [[Capture of Damascus (1920)|entered the city]] on 25 July. In his memoirs, General Gouraud wrote that after their defeat the Syrian troops left "behind 15 cannons, 40 rifles, and a general ... named Yusuf Bey al-'Azma. He died a courageous soldier's death in battle."&lt;ref name="Moubayed45"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Downtown Damascus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Yusuf al-Azma Square]] in central [[Damascus]]]]

Al-'Azma's refusal to surrender to the French, his insistence on entering battle with inferior forces and his death commanding the Syrians in Maysalun made him a national hero in Syria and the [[Arab world]]. According to Khoury, al-Azma was "henceforth immortalized by Syrians as the supreme national martyr".&lt;ref name="Khoury97"/&gt; Likewise, Provence states al-Azma "became the supreme symbol of interwar Syrian Arab patriotism".&lt;ref name="Provence213"/&gt; His statue stands in a [[Yusuf al-Azma Square|major square named after him]] in central Damascus, with streets and schools named in his honor throughout Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Herb 2008, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2UoQ-ueHjdEC&amp;pg=PA728 728]&lt;/ref&gt; Statues of al-'Azma are also present across the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Ismael57"&gt;Ismael 2013, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qQciAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57 57]&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Tareq Y. Ismael, the defeat of al-'Azma and the subsequent French takeover of Syria contributed to a popular attitude in the Arab world that exists until the present day which holds that "the West is not honorable in its commitments, speaks with a forked tongue about issues of democracy ... and will oppress anyone who stands in the way of its imperial designs".&lt;ref name="Ismael57"/&gt;

A tomb for al-Azma was erected inside a shaded grove at Maysalun in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Wien164"&gt;Wien 2017, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Though it has been frequently renovated, the original structure of the tomb remains largely intact.&lt;ref name="Wien164"/&gt; It consists of a stone sarcophagus elevated on a platform. One side of the platform has a stairway and the other side is a concrete column which carries a large concrete roof that is further supported by a beam.&lt;ref name="Wien164"/&gt; The sarcophagus has a triangular roof upon which is engraved the [[Zulfiqar]] sword.&lt;ref name="Wien164"/&gt; The Syrian military annually honors al-Azma at his tomb on Maysalun Day.&lt;ref name="Wien164"/&gt;
